laura no let him find them  matt all righty then /none/ in just a minute let us begin this next episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back all right so to give you guys a little headsup of what has recently transpired in  the story the party after completing their business in the city of vasselheim on the faroff  northwest continent grog of course having an epic battle in the crucible fight pit against  kern reclaiming his honor  travis singing i am the champion my friends  matt pike left back there to finish up the renovation of the temple of sarenrae that /none/ was discovered the  rest of the party moved on back to emon the rest of their business complete within emon they  returned to greyskull keep where they encountered a fan apparently of vox machina that had been  camping for two weeks outside who was promptly bludgeoned in the temple by vax to teach him a  lesson brought back from the brink and taught that hard lesson that this is a dangerous  field managed to seemingly reach out and touch the heart of this young intrepid wannabe  adventurer to possibly try and better himself before /none/ he throws himself into dangers way and he  ran off to train harder  taliesin dagger dagger hug  matt indeed upon returning to the keep notice was sent off to one of the other members of the  council of taldorei seeker asum who is the halfling head of whispers and all sorts of subterfuge  across the countryside who came to you notifying you that within a weeks time the briarwoods lord and  lady briarwood are supposed to be arriving here within emon for a feast to discuss building a  bridge and a more political /dung/ joining between emon the taldorei royal family and these  upandcoming lords and ladies who have a very dark history with percys character youve been  asked to join as part of this feast as you previously requested with sovereign taldorei that  should anything involved the briarwoods that you be included you have a week to figure out what  you want to do in advance of that and that is where we left off  orion what time of the day is it  matt right now after this discussion you guys arrival id say its probably midafternoon /none/  first things first though after this discussion with seeker asum who leaves the keep you do have  a brief moment of awkward silence as most of the people that work within your keep turn to you  laina looks about the rest of you and goes by the way weve been working here for about six  weeks on the pay of four were coming close to our next pay scheme and you tend to leave  often and for extended periods of time we would also like to be paid if possible  laura most definitely dear /none/ yes we are definitely going to pay you does anybody remember how much we  are supposed to pay them  orion pardon what is the total of the staffs payment  matt she thinks to herself for a moment at which point you see erwen the elderly servant in the  back says actually you had previously said it was both of our services was 50 gold each for the  month and if i recall the other mercenaries or guardians that youve hired to watch the walls of  the keep were at a discussed 100 gold for /none/ the months wages each  laura and how many of those guys do we have  matt you currently have five on your payroll yes 600 gold pieces total per month for the  services for everyone keeping your keep  laura tell you what i will front this from my personal funds for this month just because we  dont have enough in the party funds to cover that  sam we dont have 600 gold  laura we do not  sam whos our treasurer  laura i am but you bitches keep spending money  liam ill /none/ go halfsies  laura halfsies lovely twinsies will pay halfsies here you go 300 for each  matt thank you so much ill make sure this gets to the appropriate individuals immediately  theyll be very happy to not have to walk away   laura yes dont worry you will always be paid from vox machina  matt erwen steps in and by the way if you do intend to leave for an extended period of time  again i would recommend perhaps paying that in advance there was a bit of unrest last time  sam should we /none/ pay another month  laura not yet not just yet  orion ill pay him in advance right now just to get it out of the way 600 out of here phew  there you go  matt very well sire i shall disseminate this amongst the others  taliesin traditionally the head of the house does dispense out the stipends anyway that would  be appropriate im not even in the room am i never mind sorry  matt yeah youre down in the workshop  laura can i go find percy  matt you can  marisha actually /none/ we should all go find percy we should all talk to percy  matt thank you kindly tiberius thank you and he wanders off and begins counting out change into  a smaller purse  orion when they start to go id like to go to the temple with the sigils and talk to the guy who  runs the place  matt oh you mean the lyceum  orion yeah  matt okay the alabaster lyceum  orion yeah because i learned something new this week and i was like im dumb but thats where i  would like /none/ to head  matt all right so you make your way towards the alabaster lyceum the rest of you head down into  percys workshop so you head around the outskirts of the inner portion of the keep itself down the  stairway that leads to the basement floor which contains a small cell like a holding cell that  you had constructed for you in case you had somebody to take prisoner at some point to the right  to the left of you theres a small turning hallway that leads to the workshop the workshop  contains a /none/ series of various tools workbenches it actually has a working forge with anvil and  various blacksmithing tools and as you guys come down the heat is already blasting from it and  you can see percy madly diving into work of some kind  travis what are you doing percy you making more mousetraps guess not  taliesin im a bit busy i am making more ammo im working on a few projects that have been  rolling around in my head for quite some time now  orion whispers dont forget the bolt  taliesin the bolt is /none/ on the list yes  laura quite the worker  taliesin ive got a lot to do  laura yes darling  taliesin how many of you are down here right now  travis i think were all here im moving through his stuff  laura i let trinket forage around the courtyard so hes not down here at the moment  liam i think we need a little history lesson here  taliesin grog dont touch that  travis why not but it moves  laura dont touch anything  orion matthew i took some fine meats before i /none/ left and im feeding them to  lockheed along the way  matt okay lockheed enjoys them thoroughly theyre delicious comfort food crafted by the  finest of cooks in greyskull keep  marisha percy its hard not to clearly notice that youre quite distressed and were concerned  and you know we were talking about it not that we were talking about you or anything behind your  back or anything but we never really found out why you were in that  prison cell when we found you  liam weve never questioned it before weve never wanted /none/ to make you uncomfortable but were  about to walk into a party and i feel like we need a bit of a history lesson  taliesin ugh i know youre right sighs  travis should we guess was it public nudity  taliesin a bit ive never had to say this out loud before ive never actually had this  discussion with anyone  sam its okay it gets better  taliesin do i get an inspiration die for that  matt ill give you a d6 inspiration die  laughter  taliesin the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood /none/ are responsible for the death of my entire family  whitestone was my home many years ago i dont want to get into the details i came from a big  family i came from a proud family one night they were invited into our home and over the  course of that night they slaughtered everybody they are evil they are corrupting the few  survivors of castle whitestone who did survive only survived through deceit and by working for  the briarwoods turning on their masters thankfully the de rolo family still has standing  elsewhere and theres /none/ other branches of the family other than my fathers sighs i was lost  for quite a while after that happened i had nothing else in my life other than my family i  was never really going to inherit anything i was not going to run anything i was idle and at some  point i made the decision that if nothing else i survived to maybe extract some vengeance  maybe set something right maybe stop whatever it was that they were doing i dont know there was  one of their party dr ripley she was in /dung/ charge of something during the murder i dont know what  i chased her i chased her down it took a year and i had my gun and i discovered where she was  and where she was working on some ruins and i approached her i never even saw her face her  guards captured me beat me up didnt even bother taking my things they just threw me in that  dungeon i never even got close enough to see her face  sam you know her name but youve never seen her before  taliesin i saw /none/ her when she was interrogating me in my home  sam oh so you could recognize her  taliesin oh yes  laura how did you get away when they with the rest of your family  taliesin my sister cassandra my younger sister she somehow evaded capture i dont know how she  set me free i dont know what became of her i dont know what became of any of my siblings  probably nothing reasonable nothing good  liam you witnessed none of these deaths  taliesin i saw bodies of a few of them its all /none/ a bit shady its all a bit of a blur  sam how many years ago was this  taliesin sighs four now five now  laura if you know that they murdered your family how are they still part of society  taliesin i dont know sighs i could have gone home i could have gone home at any point at this  point im scared  marisha did they take over whitestone are they still there  taliesin i discovered approximately a week ago that theyre still at whitestone  laura will they recognize you  taliesin i /dung/ dont know  travis and these pricks are in good standing with the council  taliesin sighs i dont know what to do im preparing for anything when i got thrown into  that dungeon i came to the realization that maybe i wasnt doing this the right way i wasnt being  responsible and i prayed to whatever it is i pray to that maybe i would have a sign of what i should  be doing and then there you were ive been trusting that vox machina will take me where i  need to go and maybe /none/ what i need to do is confront this but i dont know what this is  and im terrified  liam and the remains of your family were they killed by the sword  taliesin i dont know there was an interrogation dr ripley was asking questions i  assumed for all these years that thats what became of my family  marisha what was she asking questions about what did they want was it just a political coup  taliesin asking questions about the castle about things about the castle it was a long time ago  and i /none/ was not equipped for torture i dont remember much  travis do you want them dead  taliesin i think so  laura should we interrogate them first find out more about your family  travis or just skip ahead to the dead part  taliesin i put down my gun and i turn the barrel and of the six barrels five of them have  names and lord and lady briarwood are two of those names dr ripley is another  sam what are the other ones  taliesin sir stonefell is the other and professor anders is the /none/ other and then theres  one blank one  laura are they all members of the same party they travel with the briarwoods  taliesin i dont know  marisha wait what were the names the briarwoods ripley sir kerrion stonefell  who is he  taliesin he was the captain of their guard  marisha and professor anders whos that  taliesin professor anders was my teacher he was my tutor and he was in collusion with them and  he was the one that i believe allowed them to take the castle in the night  marisha and /town/ do you remember why they were invited to whitestone to begin with  taliesin they were traveling they were on the road it was my brother julius and my sister  vesper who handled matters of court i was studying i didnt think  marisha and how many brothers and sisters do you have  taliesin i had six  laura you might have six we dont know what happened to them  marisha you said you saw a few bodies of family  taliesin its all very much a blur sighs theres things you just forget  sam well /none/ this is certainly tragic but looking forward what do we know of this meeting event  party what are we doing  laura well i think we need to do some spying  sam well do they know percys among us  laura thats the thing i dont know if they do  taliesin you dont have to get involved in this  laura oh we are so involved  travis laughing yeah we do you said you want them dead  laura weve got your back darling  liam percival you dont really have a choice in the matter /none/ my sister and i know a little piece of  your pain im not going to get into it but theres nothing she and i can do we can find  reparations for you we will  marisha percy is this what you want  taliesin theres only one way to find out  travis yeah  sam and if we kill them how much will you pay us just kidding we ask other people that  laura something i do need to know percy if we see them and were not ready to show our faces  will you /town/ be able to contain yourself  taliesin i think so  marisha and would they be able to recognize your face  taliesin which is why i was planning on i know we have a cap of disguise  travis oh we do  laura scanlan has it  taliesin i dont even know if they would recognize me my hair was different  laura less purple  sam we could go into town and find you a bushy mustache its worked for me many times  taliesin i dont think i wear one as well as you do  /none/ liam how does that cap work  sam well that cap is more of a hat while wearing this hat you can use an action to cast  disguise spell oh cast a disguise spell do you have to be a spellcaster to use it  matt you do not have to no  sam okay  travis i see a shiny tool i dont know what it does  matt you reach over and grab it and its a large set of tongs used for gripping large heavy  pieces of metal either for the actual forge itself or /none/ to bend  and manipulate on the workbench  travis i take it yawns and put it in the bag of holding  matt make a sleight of hand check  marisha stealing from the workshop that you partially own  travis there are lots of cool stuff in there what was the check  matt sleight of hand  travis wheres sleight of hand 17  laura my passive perception is 21  taliesin no this could be funny let this happen  laura i give him the evil eye  matt she gives you the evil eye  /none/ travis it hurts i put it back  taliesin out of curiosity what did you pick up what did it look like  travis it was a big thing of tongs i didnt know what it did i just wanted it  taliesin a big thing of tongs what would i have to roll to find out if it was covered in some  basic sulfuric acid if it was one of the things i was using for casting  matt ah interesting you know your tools very well in your workshop and yeah the metal is  scarred and /none/ pockmarked from use with the various corrosive chemicals  taliesin thatll take about ten minutes to take effect all right  gasping  orion stupid  laura youre not there  sam well this hat of disguise percival it requires some attunement i dont know how capable  you are with magical items  taliesin i can find out  liam we got seven days i can make you look like anything i can talk to the right people and get  you the right paperwork and you can be anyone and no one will know a fucking difference  /none/ marisha calm down there  taliesin i can forge paperwork as well  laura oh yes he can hes actually the guy we go to  marisha he is that guy you meet on the corner of sandy alley  sam i can make us all into birds  travis are we supposed to go meet with the council right away  taliesin no in a week  sam what do we do in the week prepare recon  laura we can do things how long of a ride is it to kraghammer  matt to kraghammer on horseback its /town/ about two and a half days  laura solo style if youre fast and back  matt fast and back id say just under two days probably  taliesin how about the giant eagle flies  marisha yeah what if youre flying  matt id say well the horse is probably a little bit faster than the eagle  laura but you dont have to stick to the road as an eagle  matt id say itd put you there about the same pace about two days on eagle because you can just  go straight through i mean you /town/ want to take the road because you know that theres a lot of  dangerous things that wander the wild that are between there  laura what do you think is it stupid to go and ride hard and try to get there and back before  sam wait were going to get cash and come back  laura we dont all have to go a couple of us can make a fast ride  marisha tiberius is working on it i have a feeling deep down inside  orion laughs why would you say that  matt you know /none/ i deduct points for metagaming  orion i didnt do anything  taliesin i agree we should send someone for the money i agree  sam and it wont take us a whole week to prepare for this party  all we need is a couple disguises  marisha yeah but we need to do research you barely know who the briarwoods are  liam we dont know if these people are straight up gangster or if theres something supernatural  seriously supernatural about them that hat would probably work on 80 of people but i dont know  we /none/ dont know anything about them  marisha well theyre not going to recognize any of us are they  sam we could go do some recon  travis besides have we seen all the brothels in emon i dont think so  sam we should do some research some reconnaissance while someone goes for the money  laura or should we wait i really want the money  taliesin people get married in my family for money i think its perfectly reasonable  sam listen we could all go get the money and be back in four days right  /none/ laura no because some people need to do some work we need to send some people off  sam split the party  liam yes  laura hopefully be back in time  taliesin theres four days we can each do our part five days  liam keyleth can you kiki  marisha yes sorry  liam can you and scanlan fly to kraghammer  marisha yes i would like to stop and talk to gilmore first though before i leave do i have  time for that i can fly  laura our illustrious god just told us its /town/ better to stick to the road  because theres bad things  marisha in the air theres air traffic i have to worry about air traffic  matt by horseback you want to stick to the road by air  sam by air though check yourself kiki  marisha what  sam you i would assume use polymorph as i do  marisha no i use my beast shaping  sam ooh thats so sexy does that last for longer than a day  marisha it lasts as long as i want it to last  sam damn  travis /none/ i go up to the kitchen and look for something to eat  marisha its in my blood  sam you can be an animal as long as you want  marisha where are you going with this scanlan  matt you can stay in beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level five hours  right now you can transform for  marisha so when i mean as long as i want i mean long enough to where ive never had to really  think about it before now  sam well then like /none/ me flying there would not be an option wed have to stop rest walk sleep  laura yeah that would slow it down a lot  marisha well i could get ten hours because i can use two beast shaping abilities  laura but thats still a two days flight  liam two days is the horse riding hard what about an eagle  marisha no i get my druid shapes back after a short rest  laura oh okay  marisha because circle of the moon bitch  matt so you could beast shape twice rest 30 minutes beast /none/ shape twice  marisha can i make a stop first and then ill run an errand  liam we dont really have a lot of money at the moment  laura she might have some  marisha yeah ive got my personal fundsies  taliesin can you leave me an earpiece so that i can keep in contact im not leaving my workshop  marisha i have an earpiece right  laura well leave you alone percy to work  marisha is there anything else you need from us percy is there anything you need  while im out and /dung/ about  taliesin leave me an earpiece and ill call if i need anything else  travis percy is there anything in this shop that you want in the bag of holding for later  taliesin not yet thank you grog  laura do you not have an earpiece  travis ill give him mine  taliesin how many minutes has it been im wondering if his hands are starting to itch yet  matt about this time you start to get this weird tingling sensation around your fingers  travis do they crave blood  matt no they crave /none/ some sort of an agent that will prevent the now slight burning sensation  travis ow quick question sorry i kept something from falling in the shop really quick  reflexes its making my bits tingle do you have anything for that  liam you havent been scratching yourself have you  travis no i had that before not the same thing  taliesin theres a bucket of water in the corner you can try that  travis i go over to the bucket of water and i stick my hands in the water  taliesin itll make it worse /none/  matt it does the slight burning sensation now has turned into a very vibrant burning white hot  on the skin and you can see bits of the skin start to peel back a little bit  beginning on the edges  taliesin i hand him a small bag of powder now youve learned not to touch things if you dont  know what they are  travis what do i do with a bag of powder  taliesin i pour the powder on his hands  matt it foams up a little bit in places but it is /none/ neutralized  travis yeah  taliesin youre a good friend  travis can i leave now i go to the kitchen to eat  matt all righty you easily get another meal mustered for you  marisha im going to go make a trip to gilmores anybody want to join  liam i should probably tag along  sam ill come too  matt youre working in the workshop youre eating you guys are going to gilmores all  right so as this is happening tiberius you make your way over to the alabaster lyceum you come up  to /none/ the front main area of the structure itself its an arcane college you make your way to the  front clerk who looks up to you a nice young fellow looks like hes trying to work through his  credit in school through his training hes dressed in the ceremonial robes of somebody who is  a student who is currently stuck with the job of working as a clerk hes like  hi can i help you  orion yes hi if you do not remember me i am tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover vox  machina over at /none/ greyskull keep  matt where have i heard that  orion well we told you multiple times before we met with you using your sigil of teleport its  fine ive come here on a matter of business anyway so thats neither here nor there i was  wondering if i may procure an address or number as it were for a sigil to kraghammer i believe  the thunderbrands would have some facility near theirs or on their own premises where their sigil  could be channeled through the circle of teleportation spell  matt if youre talking about /none/ sigils for teleportation you would probably have to discuss  that with gatekeeper xanthas  orion where is he i thought that was you  matt no im the clerk i run the front of the follow me and he gets up and leads you further  into the structure to the central circular room the whitemarbled room that contains all the doors  around and in the center there is the traverse junction this is the place you guys have stumbled  into every single time youve teleported back to emon and there you see the elven wizard who /none/ you  recently bothered naught but maybe five hours ago who is currently setting up some sheets comes  back oh hello again  orion hi im tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover vox machina over at greyskull keep i  was wondering and i asked your clerk here because i thought he did what you actually do  here if i may procure for coin or perhaps some kind of favor of sorts the address or number or  code or whatever it is that would work for the kraghammer sigil of my circle of teleportation  matt i get /none/ an understanding here that youre seeking access to one of our many sigilbased  rooms of transference those rooms are currently under very protected lock and key approval by the  headmaster thurmond adalum himself  orion okay where is he  marisha oh my god its like calling time warner cable  orion can you take me to him where is he at  matt glances over at the clerk who goes right this way mr stormwind he leads you back to a  long long hallway with arched ceiling you can see the marble itself has these carvings /none/ and  sculptures of various deadlooking faces of longpassed mages that either were built or held  in high esteem in the halls of this lyceum at the very end it opens up into a pretty  welldecorated almost overthetop decorated office room for the headmaster himself the  interior is lined with large large 15 20foottall bookshelves around this oval room  with sliding ladders that are attached to them that slowly glide on their own like theyre on  some sort of arcanebased pattern that puts them back and forth there is a large chandelier of  brightly /none/ colored orbs that sits 35 40 feet in the air that slowly rotates on its own that keeps  this slowly fluctuating changing color of the room and in the center there is a circular desk  and sitting there at the desk you can see is headmaster thurmond who is this extremely elderly  human male shaved face very short curved bald head with a little bit of hair in the back  hunched forward and is currently collecting a series of books into his arms looks like hes  about to get up and he turns and looks /town/ over can i help you  orion hello  orion and sam im tiberius stormwind from draconia  orion moreover vox machina over at greyskull keep here in emon we are the saviors of this town  and whatnot anyway thats neither here nor there i went through this fellow who i thought  was the job of this fellow but it wasnt either of those jobs it was you who ive been needing to  talk to im assuming  matt what do you require from me then  orion im hoping to procure an address or access to /none/ the sigils of kraghammer through my circle of  teleportation spell and whatnot using your arcane gates thats about it  laughter  sam well put  matt if youre asking for access to one of our closely guarded sigils for the thunderbrands you  say within kraghammer  orion yes yes well have to speak with them as well  matt well then i will just one moment and he reaches into a pouch and pulls out this mirror  this oval mirror and sets it onto his desk reaches underneath and pulls out a small chest  opens /none/ up the chest and you can see in this chest that there are probably two dozen of these tiny  little marbles all different colors some different shapes and he goes these little labels  you cant really see from your perspective he takes one out places it in the top of the mirror  and as he does the mirror all of a sudden shimmers for a second and what was originally a  normal reflection is now this light glowing blue slightly glowing waterlike surface he takes it  and lifts it up to himself hello hello hello /none/ a moment later you hear this distant voice  echoing with this strange warbling filter over it im coming whats taking your time yes  headmaster what do you require  well theres a gentleman here dragonborn who is requesting use of your sigil of teleportation  do you know this gentleman turns it around and you can see in there this is the same  longbearded dwarven individual that met you at the actual thunderbrand house and had a bit of an  argument with you early in your travels in kraghammer  orion weve got things for you /none/ this time like we said we would get for you in the underdark  its really inconvenient but we have things that we need to get to you quickly  matt now listen here last we spoke you and your friends stormed into our lair nearly  destroyed our precious arcane defenses of our homestead  orion he was drinking hes an alcoholic hes got help since then  matt make a deception check  orion what is it  matt this is deception well you are an alcoholic but that wasnt what he meant  orion 20  matt /none/ 20 laughs he goes either way we cant just let anyone willynilly knowing how to directly  appear in the center of our homestead  orion in same accent as matt of course oh sorry i started to sound like you  laughter  taliesin bring me another accent aye  orion of course i wouldnt expect you to im tiberius stormwind from draconia my father  kruvanis stormwind has helped the council for over two generations we come from a noble house and i  give you my word that i will never abuse abuse however you pronounce it /none/ in your tongue  the privilege of quickly traveling to your stead to do business with you and there would be no  other intrusion otherwise i guarantee it as my name as a stormwind  matt make a persuasion roll  sam chief negotiator  orion thats 11  matt 11 his head turns to the side a little bit peering through you with a slight scowl last we  talked the reason we didnt report you to the guard for breaking through our defenses was you  promised to look beneath the city and bring back various artifacts /none/ you were in search of  orion ooh we found one  matt did you now  orion a couple yes and we killed a bunch of those buttholes  matt can i see one of these artifacts  orion i dont have it on me right now  matt were done here headmaster and the mirror shimmers and closes suddenly  marisha wait no  liam good try  laura we can bring oh were not there  matt the headmaster takes the marble out and says  im sorry that didnt seem to go your way  orion /none/ its fine headmaster ill be back in about 15 minutes with the proper proof that we did  procure the things that the man that needed to have proof did excuse me and i get the hell out  of there and as soon as i get out of there i cast fly on myself and i gandalf whoosh right  back to the keep  matt all righty youre eating youre crafting are you going with the rest of them to gilmore  laura i dont know i guess so  matt all right you guys make your way /none/ to the outside of gilmores glorious goods  sam as we walk do we see tiberius fly over our heads  laura actually im staying at the keep  orion well travis is my target right are you still at the keep  travis yeah im eating  matt as far as time goes you havent quite gotten to that point yet for these guys you get  to gilmores you enter the interior you can see that for the most part there arent a lot of  people in here its getting later in the day and a lot /none/ of the customer business seems to be  happening almost earlier either prenoon or around noon theres no current sign of gilmore  you do see across the way whats her name again  marisha sherri  matt thank you sherri the mousy helper who runs the shop in gilmores absence or at least runs  the first portion of it with her thick glasses up on her nose and shes sitting there with her  elbows over the top of the main desk she looks up as you enter and takes her glasses and pokes them  for a /none/ second hello hi  liam do you remember us  matt right i do  marisha from vox machina were sponsored by gilmore he put the brand on my armor that my  mother gave me  matt and you should be wearing it proudly yes now what can i help you with  sam well is gilmore around  liam yes i was hoping to catch up with him weve been gone a while and i was hoping to trade  news with glorious gilmore is he not in at the moment  matt gilmores in westruun currently setting /none/ up the expansion of the gilmores glorious goods  business if this is important i can certainly summon him here  liam id hate to pull him away from business i dont want to get in the way of his business i  mean i am rather sad not to see him but no i dont think that would be a course of action wed  want to take let him continue to set up  matt all right i suppose  liam can you get a message to him though  matt yes i can actually  liam well /none/ tell him vaxildan and friends visited were in the city for a week  matt she pulls out a small sheet of what looks like a rougharoundtheedges piece of parchment  and starts the inkwell scribbling down  liam vaxildan thats with an a not an e were here for a week i dont know if hes going to be  back from westruun before then but if he is tell him to get word to me im very interested in  exchanging news for the past few weeks  matt all right foreign words it flashes and disappears in /none/ front of her well then hell be  receiving the message right about now well pass that on and whenever he returns im certain he  will get back to you and deal with whatever business is necessary  liam thank you were here late in the day are you still open for business  matt we are open yes  marisha i was just curious if you guys had a chance to think about the alchemy workshop that we  talked about before or if you maybe had any alchemy books that came in that i was requesting  /none/ matt its possible we havent completely restocked the shelves as of late i know we had  some new things come in i can go check and as she turns all of a sudden theres a large  vibrant white flash of light and a sound from the back room the beaded curtains shift for a  second and you hear heavy footsteps and pushing through the beaded curtain you see before you  with a bead of sweat on his head gilmore im so glad you came back  sam and marisha gilmore  matt im sorry i was /none/ out and about running some business a ways away  liam you didnt have to go to all that trouble to come back here  matt how could i miss seeing my fine theres not as many of you as usual  liam no were seeing to different bits of business i turn back to him i walk forward with  hands out i walk up to him take him by the head give him a good europeanstyle kiss just about here  right there come back and say there is so much to talk about where can we be /none/ alone  matt he looks over at the rest of the group well i mean  laughter  matt but of course  liam see to whatever business you need to  sam well just peruse yeah well window shop  matt he walks back through the beaded curtain giving you this look over his shoulder as he  does the curtain falls behind him  liam those beads  travis oh jeez  liam i walk right in follow him in  matt and you can see now as the glow gently fades there is a rug that is /none/ pushed to the side  and on the floor of his room there is a familiar sigil similar to the one that youve seen  tiberius scrawl before in some of his spells thats apparently how he got here so quickly but  he walks in and he kicks the rug back over it sits down on the edge of his bed puts his hands  up and goes what seems to be troubling you  liam i walk over and i sit down opposite him and i say before we talk about anything i feel like  i should /none/ apologize because although we didnt have any sort of written agreement you and i are  friends arent we  matt yes  liam and i was supposed to help bring your brand wherever we went and i thought that would be  possible we came back from the underdark we had a very hard time some of the hardest weeks of my  life i havent delivered on my promise and i mean to but i havent yet i apologize  wholeheartedly im sorry  matt thats all right i understand people grow busy there are things you must /none/ tend to and  thats all right and i appreciate you being so honest i really do  liam in addition to that i am changed and promises mean more to me even more than they did  before and i promise to follow through in the interest of time for the game dm vax tells the  whole story of the underdark of the horn of how close it was  marisha ugh what is taking him so long scanlan  sam i dont know  matt while thats happening the rest of you are left there awkwardly staring /none/ about  marisha did sherri find my book sherri  matt a few minutes go by sherri comes back she brings two books over  best i can tell these may be what youre looking for i cant quite she sets them down  one is a book that is the properties of various liquids chemicals and things that are found on  this plane and otherwise its a good way to locate and identify phantom liquids should you  come across any  marisha that would be good for scanlan  taliesin he is the source of a lot /none/ of phantom liquids  matt the other book appears to have a section about alchemy its essentially almost a  beginners guide but its a very very easytofollow introduction to a number of  various lowlevel sorceries and the creation of lowlevel spell components preparing them for use  with spellcasting and there is a chapter on a little bit of alchemy  marisha okay how much are these sherri  matt they havent been priced yet  marisha i mean theyre theyre all right  laura good going keyleth i like it  matt 25 gold each  marisha /none/ 25 gold each oh come on i know some university student dropped these off and donated  these dont kid me sherri am i doing it right do i sound like vex  matt make a persuasion roll  marisha damn it  taliesin i was about to say make her do a persuasion roll itd be funny  sam unforced error  taliesin im sorry  laughter  liam i spoke too soon  travis so perfect so perfect for you  matt she reaches out and takes the books and slides them back and says well if thats /none/ how  you feel perhaps these can be returned to those university students that perhaps left them by i  should put these in the lost and found  marisha sherri  sam sherri if i may what keyleth was trying to say was that she never got a chance to go to  college and that she wanted to get that university experience  matt good luck  sam well that didnt work hey can you serve me now  marisha whispering scanlan scanlan will you buy those books for me and ill reimburse you  matt i can /none/ hear you im right here  laughter  travis walk away  matt yes im happy to help you  sam i was wondering if you had a small box of some sort that could carry a magical item and  perhaps shield it from detection  matt that yes we do have a couple of those hold on she darts up the stairway in the other  room and goes to the second floor a few moments later she comes back down with these two small  chests theyre about that big each ones a lighter wood color the /none/ other is painted black all  over we have both of these they should shield something of this size from most lowlevel magical  detections these will run you about 200 gold apiece  sam i just need one youre a woman of the world and im sure you have fine taste judging by your  appearance it is quite fine if i may say so myself if i were a little taller i would  probably ask you out on a date  matt if you were a little taller yes  marisha sherri is sassy today  orion /none/ shes full of sass  sam which one is the fancier of the two  matt well looking at these this one she points to the one that looks like just a casual  wood chest this would be easier to hide in plain sight amongst the rest of your furniture this  one however would be difficult to locate in a more shaded or lightless circumstance  sam hm i want ostentatiousness  matt then perhaps this one  sam yes please that thanks thank you 200 to you also i know gilmore is otherwise  entertained can you /none/ try to identify something for me do you have that i mean judging by the  glint in your eye and beauty in your heart im sure you have many skills i dont know about but  im wondering if you could identify this small red vial with a floating something in it that i  procured quite some time ago do you remember that  matt yes this vial if i recall it has this small  sam have i tried this once before  matt no this is the one that was found  sam me and pike /none/ found some stuff in somebodys house i dont even remember  this was a year ago  matt right yes okay there we go and make a persuasion roll actually on this one  sam a lot  taliesin oh look a real roll  marisha shut up  sam persuasion its 35 wait 31 31  travis matt just visited his mind palace  matt she looks at you and goes you have been good patrons and you have been much kinder to me  than others well put this one on the house well call this on the /none/ house and as she takes  the vial sets it down and she pulls out another book that she shuffles through puts it up turns  through a few pages until looking through this here would be a potion of fire breath when  imbibed it should give you a temporary time period of the ability to breathe fire much like a  relatively young dragon this one in particular is fire there are many different vials like this  that pertain to different colorations of dragon but this one is specifically for the red  sam thank you so /town/ much thank you well thank you so much two more questions then ill leave you  alone one where can i go get business cards printed up in this town its a calling card  never mind forget it  matt like a flyer  sam yes  matt those can be printed there is a actually a pretty welldesigned print facility  not that far up the road  sam oh great thank you ill go investigate that and one other thing you know those books  that my friend was asking about could we maybe make those happen /none/ for her i know that you had  quoted her a low low price of 25 id be prepared to pay even more than that for them and compose  you a little song about yourself  matt at which point for the first time since the entire time youve been in the shop of gilmores  glorious goods you see a slight grin creep across her lips she goes how could a lady say no to a  song 25 gold the price stands  sam so i have to pay you and sing to you  matt we /none/ run a business here yes  sam all right  matt she pulls the books out  sam i bring out my something  laughter  sam sings sherri baby sherri baby sherri wont you come home tonight come home tonight  you better ask your mama tell her youre without a gnome why dont you come home to my keep  matt pay for the books  sam okay here you go  matt you can see her face is flushed and she clears throat  marisha i druidcraft a flower real quick and slip it to scanlan to /none/ give to her  sam oh here you are  matt thank you  travis gasps did she blush  matt shes red in the face at this point in time the beaded curtains reopen have you  finished the conversation or do you want to keep going  liam no after ten minutes of finishing all that of telling every tiny detail if you mind me  backtracking i briefly place my hand on top of his and say it was terrible ive never seen  anything like it now were back were in our home and im hoping /none/ to learn how uriel is doing  how the city is faring is there any news things are ill in kraghammer they still havent seen the  last of their troubles but im also concerned for our new home here  matt as far as im aware this city has been doing rather well since winters crest just this  previous year trade has been booming were opening up pathways all across the continent  weve improved relations with many other distant kingdoms and im opening a second shop i mean  thats amazing and who wouldve thought  liam /none/ and westruun hows it going  matt so far so good were going through the construction process and im making sure that i  have a rather supple income of artifacts and oddities that i have to sell at both locations i  have to widen my input of various items and  liam youre a busy man  matt oh yes  liam have you any time for leisure  matt eventually you can see hes a little more worn than youve seen gilmore before hes  still gilmore and hes excited but after the tale you told him /none/ and opening the second shop has  been a little rough on him and his jovial self is a little more wearied  though he still looks fabulous  liam you seem a tad weary is there anything i can do to help you  matt just praise the brand praise the brand young vax  liam that will happen i did not even mean to discuss this coming here but i noticed coming  in a sigil under your carpet i had no intention of this but we need to get back to kraghammer in  a bit of /town/ a hurry and i certainly have no abilities but do you remember my friend tiberius  dragonborn fellow  matt yes yes i remember him  liam he needs to run an errand back in kraghammer is there any way you could hook us up  with a favor  matt what kind of favor  liam i just want to send the lizard to dwarf town do you think we could make that happen  marisha send the lizard to dwarf town how many more slurs can you have in one sentence  matt my sigil here is for /none/ returning personal use did you hear that there was some strange  noise in the sky this is for my return as far as outgoing most other sigils are well theyre up  here looking for that youre going to have to go to the lyceum im afraid  liam understood i dont want to push my luck  matt however if youre going to the lyceum i am owed a favor or two let me see what i can do  here and he goes and he pulls out another piece of similar paper and he writes a quick /none/ little  note on the side sends it up in the air and it vanishes he goes ive just done you a favor  keep that in mind you go to the lyceum you should have access to one of these sigils make  sure you choose properly you only have one  liam im pretty magicstupid  matt then dont be the one that does it talk to your friend this tiberius fellow hell know what  to do im sure  liam correct one last its small or its boring its business i need a dagger i dont /none/  want one for free or anything i want to purchase it but were a little low on funds the reason  tiberius needs to go to kraghammer is because were owed a large sum of money  matt right you mentioned this last time when you almost opened a line of gilmores  glorious credit  laura mmhm im not there  liam what would the credit entail  matt previously we discussed 25000 gold pieces the amount of which you were going to  retrieve  liam i was going to what was that  matt retrieve  /town/ liam retrieve god ive been in the underdark so long what was the deal  matt the deal was since you did not have funds and you had to retrieve this money from this  dwarf town as you so graciously put it that you would borrow the money at the time and then  pay me back within a month within a month  liam understood  marisha wait is gilmore trying to say we owe him money  liam no we almost did that correct dm thats what we almost did but we didnt do it you  /none/ offered it  matt correct you backed out last minute when you realized there was apparently hidden platinum  liam i would be interested gilmore i really just need a quick favor and i mean to pay you  back quickly i need a dagger for something not your best dagger not your shittiest dagger  either i just need something nice how much would a fine dagger cost something that would be good  in a fight and could i pay you back in a couple of days once tiberius returns from kraghammer  matt if you want something /none/ functional there are masterwork daggers out there we do have  baselevel enchantments that give you a fine honed edge and a balance that cannot be beaten for  its price range for that i can easily give you one of our baselevel enchanted items for no more  than friend discount included 400 gold pieces  taliesin thats a pretty good deal  liam can i please purchase three of those  matt you may  liam done  matt all right ill get these right now he stands up and now that theres some sort of  business /none/ involved hes completely renovated and recharged he comes through the beaded curtain  again you guys see gilmore burst out like laughs were in business and he goes into the  next room and back up the stairs and takes a few moments he comes back down with an armful of  these daggers and sets them down on the counter three for you  thatll be 1200 gold pieces please  liam i reach out and i give his cheek a little bubbysqueeze and i clap him on the cheek and  say im good on my word and /none/ youre a good friend thank you gilmore  matt the least i could do pay me back ill find you  liam i know youre good on your word  matt indeed  liam keyleth scanlan  sam oh yes howd it go in there youre walking straight so it couldnt have gone too well  liam very good warm in here  taliesin that daggers so sharp it could cut the sexual tension  orion those are masterwork daggers  matt they are plusone enchanted daggers yes  sam well lets get out of here and go did you /none/ find us any  liam im good no everythings good here just not everywhere else  sam lets get out of here go back to the keep  matt at this point now tiberius you have coasted over the air and as you come careening  in you hear swishing sounds and look down two crossbow bolts whiz past you  orion its me you idiots  matt at which you hear immediately oh sorry sorry were not used to having you bolt in from  the skyline  orion im in a hurry sorry whoosh  matt as you /none/ sweep past shayne and cordell they both change their bolts and theyre both arguing  with each other like you shouldve seen it was him sorry sorry again you make your way  into the courtyard inside greyskull keep  travis whyd you miss  orion i go into i rush in to find him eating stammers quickly quickly and i go into the bag  of holding and i take the item out that we need what was it  travis well we have a bunch of stuff  matt youre not with him there  laura i walk /none/ into the room to see tiberius throwing things out of the  bag of holding im assuming  orion i cant because i have to visualize what it is to pull it out  travis yeah what are you looking for  liam im using my earring on the walk home does it work i dont know what the range is tiberius  can you hear me tibs  matt youre pretty out of range at this point  travis what are you looking for tiberius  orion ive taken my hand out when we were in the underdark and /none/ one of the items that we procured  while we were scavenging and we looted it and we could give it back to the thunderbrand  travis oh pieces of the enemy we get paid for it  laura but there were artifacts that they wanted i remember  marisha they wanted a necklace right  orion yes and we found one or two of them  marisha found a necklace who was supposed to go hang on im finding it im looking  travis ive got two gold necklaces two gold chalices and two rubies  matt it was /none/ actually a magical item one that you may have equipped itll say in the description of  the item that it has an inscription on the back  orion i dont have it  travis i dont have that shit  sam whoa what it was a necklace were talking about  matt protection of some kind if i recall amulet  laura oh i dont have that gasps oh no what if we gave it to kima  orion we didnt give it to them  laura but kima took some armor we found  sam amulet of natural /none/ armor  matt look in the description of the item it should say underneath the name itll have the  actual inscription written in the descriptor of the item  travis everybody look at your stuff i look inside my belt of dwarvenkind and it says  badass  marisha its a sapphire pendant that should say to lorna my love  laura gasps oh  orion thats what i reach in and grab there you go keyleth i mean your highness  i like your hair  marisha thank you  orion it looks cool  marisha thanks  /dung/ matt it is enchanted  marisha its not the one youre wearing right scanlan  laura no i remember we found it and nobody equipped it  travis i had it in the bag yeah  orion i take it out and i put it in mine grog im finding out a way as soon as i can show this  to you fellow im going to go into kraghammer very very fast as opposed to slowly and it is  so we should leave right now  laura can i go with you  orion yeah and ill cast /none/ because who was around just them two  matt just those two  orion i cast fly again at 3rd or 4th level to cast on them  travis i dont want to go  matt now all of a sudden youre whoosh lifted up in the air  orion yes but we get there much faster if we fly and i go  laura and i take off after him  travis what if i want to stay  orion you can stay  travis but im fucking floating above my meal no this is bullshit and im bouncing /none/ off the  ceiling and shit can i control myself  matt you can it takes a moment to adjust to it  travis i just start trying to swim down to my plate  matt it takes you a little bit but you do eventually get control of it  travis eating noises this isnt so bad farting noise  matt propulsion does work  laura as were flying can i keep an eye out for our party members that are returning  matt yep and as you guys coast over you see leaving the exterior wall gate to /none/ the south side  of emon you see the rest of your party walking back towards the keep  laura that means were close enough brother  liam hello  laura were heading to the portal tiberius is working on something we can get there faster  ill be back soon  liam oh all right gilmore has an in he said we just need to mention his name and were through  we can send tiberius through  laura brilliant  orion ooh that gives me a wonderful idea and then ill cast it at 4th level again and /none/ ill go  pewpew and cast it on  marisha just because i think its funny grog is flying over too right  travis im in that kitchen floating around farting and eating food  look ive got priorities  marisha okay well i see you guys are flying the two of you  matt so you fly down and cast fly on the rest of them  orion right come on follow me  liam holy shit ive never flown before this is amazing  sam im flying too whats happening  matt you guys are now floating you /none/ guys are floating as well youre coasting over emon for  roughly 12 or so seconds before grog you drop to the ground and now tiberius and vex  you begin to plummet  laura why are we plummeting  matt fly is a concentration spell you cast it again your amulet keeps it up for two rounds  which is 12 seconds and then the previous fly spell deteriorates  orion what about my circlet  matt thats what im saying the circlet lets you maintain concentration for two additional rounds  laura oh okay tiberius im falling  /none/ orion i cast fly again at 6thlevel on everybody else  sam i start falling  orion no because i can catch everybody  matt at that point now all of you guys are flying  orion you fall in the kitchen though  travis well that makes sense  liam is this going to stick tiberius  orion yes its the same spell i just really need a nap after this i really need a nap after  this i go back to gather them all  matt you make your way now all of you following tiberius you /none/ coast down to the alabaster lyceum  landing right through the front area whoosh this whole party appears catch your feet and  there you see the same clerk looking up ah i see youve returned  orion yes can we not talk to the middle guy first can we go right to the last guy  matt down that hallway follow it to the very end  orion thank you very much  matt youre welcome  orion follow me everybody  matt you all glide through the hallway or walk if you prefer the end of the hallway /none/ you open  once again into the office and there you see behind his desk once again the headmaster  thurmond who looks around oh yes youve returned i received the note from your friend  gilmore and youre welcome to utilize one of our sigils  orion wonderful that makes me quite happy  matt to kraghammer was it  orion yes but i do not want to use that favor for that sigil i would like to call our friends  and i brought the item i bring out the amulet i want to show our friends in /none/ kraghammer that we  actually brought them the thing to get their permission to go on their sigil and the other  continent that we were on is called what  laura vasselheim  orion yes the favor i would like for gilmore is to get the vasselheim sigil please but lets  contact our friends at kraghammer first  matt two notes there is no sigil in vasselheim they have been outlawed and destroyed to prevent  arcane intrusion or subterfuge there have been historically many a wars passed in which  vasselheim nearly fell to the sudden appearance /none/ of small armies within its walls and as such  many of these sigils all of them have been destroyed over the past 1000 years however it  was the third war and hes going into a long diatribe about the history of vasselheim  laura you are so educated perhaps we could talk later about all of this wonderful history  matt certainly yes im sorry the mirror he pulls up the mirror pulls out his chest brings  out the same marble again pops it into the mirror it shimmers hello hello you hear  another voice say /none/ oh are you kidding me really you again all right what are you  bothering me with  orion using my mage hand im like its one of the things that you wanted us to get  laura who are you talking to  orion i can see it its fine  matt whats it say i cant read it from here read it out for me  orion what does it say keyleth  marisha to lorna with love its written right there tiberius  orion oh sorry to lorna with love  matt at which point you see /none/ the eyes of this dwarf that were very untrusting open wide for a  second all right give him the sigil send him through ill see you soon  the mirror gives out again  laura oh all of us  matt no the headmaster takes the mirror and puts it down he points back to the clerk whos in

 matt for this because its not active it would be your passive  marisha then that is 24  matt vax has vanished while you might have noticed instead the explosionlike eruption of  gas from your dragonborn friend distracted you and gave him the proper getaway you vanish  liam yeah im totally down an alleyway through the alley onto another main thoroughfare i grab  a random person on the street excuse me im looking for a specific butcher harold the  butcher do you know i /tavern/ think hes in the upper slums can you point me toward him  matt the individual you stopped is a younger gentleman probably in his mid20s or so a bit  dirty in the face and coming from a day of work going to the local tavern to finish his eve with  some drinks i cant say i do i mean there are butchers all over town theres one  liam wheres the upper slums upper slums please  matt oh that would be north side of emon that way he points you towards the  liam i dont /none/ even say anything else i just walk i dont know how long that will take me  matt it will take you about from where you are right now 30 minutes all right so you guys get  back to the keep grog has eaten his fill  travis im asleep on the table  matt yeah passed out percys nowhere to be seen you i would like for you to make a  tinkering roll in relation to the construction of ammunition  taliesin ten  matt ten you manage to utilizing material for 20 bullets only craft ten /none/ but you get ten  bullets out of it as opposed to wasting the materials  orion is it possible to before i go to sleep i have a basic poison potion ive been hoarding  could i try to dip the tip of one of my bolts in that  matt you can certainly try theres a difference between poison and disease theyre different the  potion seems to have no effect  orion on bolts  matt it doesnt have any effect  taliesin how many batches of bullets are you going to let me attempt to make /town/  matt for the day thats what you spent making tomorrow well get to whatever it is you want to  craft then you go off and manage to make your way to the upper slums  liam yes i see a stunted old woman and stop her on the street and say grandmother im looking  for harold the butcher do you know where i can find him  matt best i can gather hed be around that way she points you and the breath is awful  shes missing teeth but her crooked finger curves off to the /none/ side and you can see across the way  next to a homestead or hovel there is a very humblelooking butcher that is currently in the  process of closing shop  liam id like to go stealth i rolled a 20  matt all right you make your way up there you can see theres an older gentleman in his mid40s  or so saltandpepper hair black with a bit of gray on the sides  is currently in the process of closing up  liam do i see kynan anywhere no and its a home its a business /none/ and a home  matt its hard to tell it looks like a business from this perspective  liam okay id like to go around the back of the building and scope it out  matt you look through the windows theres a dull light on the inside from what looks like a small  hooded lantern set up for a bit of interior light but theres nobody else in the house  liam theres nobody in id like to at the window listen and use perception to see if i can  tell if anyones inside  matt you /none/ listen for a while make a perception roll  liam yeah thats 25  matt all right as you continue to listen eventually you hear the slamming of wood you look  off and through the bit of the glass window youre peeking from the side you see the same  gentleman who was closing the shop enter the room where the hooded lantern is theres a table he  sits down quietly for a second looks at the lamp starts cleaning his fingernails a little bit  gives a big sigh and turns off the light of the lantern /none/ and exits the room  closing the door behind him  liam is it one floor the building  matt its one floor  liam its one floor is the window locked  matt you checked the window its not locked  liam all right im climbing in  matt you slip in without a problem youve done this many times before  liam its a family residence where kynan lives are there bedrooms  matt its hard to tell looking around the room here there are three doors that exit one that he  came through which is apparently /none/ from the front of the butcher shop this appears to be a central  room that connects to wherever else he walked there are two other doors  liam theyre not trapped are they  matt theyre not trapped  liam so im going to crouch down and push open the first door what do i see  matt the door immediately right or the door in front of you the door in front of you is the one  that the man traveled through  liam oh no not that one there were two other doors werent there  /dung/ matt theres the door that he came in from when he sat down and then he left through the door  across the way from you and there is a door that been unopened  liam theres one other door thats the one  matt okay you push open the door very quietly it makes a little creaking sound but you stop  peering inside its dark there appears to be a bed theres a small table theres what looks  like an old pair of boots that are worn out on the side it looks  like a bedroom /none/ that nobodys currently in  liam and theres no sign that this is a youths bedroom or fathers bedroom what can i glean from  what i see in here  matt make an investigation check  liam im going to use luck thats better 22  matt okay you take a little bit of time in peering over the materials looking at the bed  size looking at the boot size looking at whatever you can nearby this bed is definitely  weathered its been used for a long time there are a couple of small knickknacks and toys /none/ that  are discarded underneath that have been there for a while that lead you to believe that this was at  one point a boys room however what you do notice is that most of the materials most of the  belongings anything that you would normally see in a boys room anything that would say that a  person lives here seem to have been hastily grabbed and taken off  liam and the father went out the other way all right so i creep back out the window and i go out  the front and i /none/ knock really loud on the front door  matt a couple moments later a voice comes from the other side hello  liam hello im sorry i dont mean to bother you i know youve closed up shop  matt im done for business for the day come back tomorrow  liam im actually not looking to buy anything i owe your son a bit of money i lost some money in  a wager we made on a dog fight and i was hoping to reimburse him do you know where he is  matt the door opens a /none/ little bit and an eye peeks through you gather theres a slight scent  of alcohol from the other side as he starts talking he says i dont know where my sons  gone off to he came in in a huff we got in an argument he grabbed his stuff and left he does  this every now and then hell be back  liam you think hell be back  matt this isnt the first time hes done this  liam i want to leave something with you  matt you said it was money you owed him /none/  liam yes  matt i can give that to him  liam i take 50 gold of what i have left and i leave it with him and i take out three daggers i  can hear my sisters voice in the back of my head i want to use insight on him to make sure hes  trustworthy oh thats good thats 20  matt okay theres something about his face that gives you the feeling that hes more interested in  the contents of what youre leaving than actually transferring these to the intended recipient  liam /none/ just give him the 50 gold thank you and i leave  matt okay closes the door behind you you hear a lock light goes back out in the room  sam go in there and kill him kill him shit on his bed and leave  liam i head back to the keep  matt okay all right eventually vax finds his way back to the keep the rest of you are there  at rest for the evening is there anything else you want to accomplish before the nights out  marisha i just flipped through my book /none/ on the alchemy section for a bit  matt all right you all find yourself to bed

well you are a humanoid which is water is good which most of you is water  travis gasps you always drink water when we drink does it burn  orion no it /none/ feels rather  sam lets get going  taliesin he does breathe fire  orion im feeding lockheed some of my breakfast  matt certainly lockheed enjoys the breakfast lockheed is looking healthier the color is a  little more of a deep emerald green and he appears to have  a little more energy this morning  sam does it shit on your shoulder  matt he hasnt noticed but there is a slight streak of dried pseudodragon poo youre not  aware of it to cast that yet  taliesin methinks the dm doth speak from experience  /none/ matt as a bird owner he does  orion im going to i rolled im going to do a roll for the day i think i rolled one for the  day and im going to go staht staht and im going to  i rolled a 14 to try to teach it to sit staht  matt lizard noises it sits down on the edge of the table  orion and i give it a treat krar krar there you go

get out of here cast the thing lets go  orion as im having my oatmeal and such i start to cast  marisha i still think maybe the more talkative members of the group should go  sam still want to split the party  taliesin im staying home anyway  marisha im checking in with tiberius oh sorry percy  matt at which point the teleportation sigil appears in the /none/ center of the floor the way  tiberius had prepared it its glowing right now  travis ive got the creature bits so i should go too  laura you take care of my bear im leaving him here with you  liam all right i got him  laura oh trinket i love you so  matt trinket comes up and like rubs his nose against your coat  laura behave all right  liam im going to feed you so much chocolate  laura thats really bad for him dont  marisha itll be fine  matt the /dung/ sigils starting to spark  sam i jump in  travis i jump in too  matt okay so all of you who are going you leap in youre staying and youre staying correct  and youre staying all right keyleth percy and vax all of you guys step in and all of a sudden  theres a familiar whoosh of some sort of dark transference you feel as if gravity for a moment  doesnt exist and your feet find purchase on some sort of a wooden floor the room is dark you  glance about the immediate vicinity /none/ and for those of you who have low light theres very little you  can actually make out other than the fact this is a basement of some kind and you are amidst a  bunch of sheet covered crates  orion light whoosh  matt as the light fills the room you look around  orion i cast it on lockheed on his tail  matt all right lockheed begins trying to shake the light off the tail  so it moves around a little bit  orion oh bensvelk that means good in draconian bensvelk and i feed /none/ him a treat  matt chuckles all right you look around the room there are about six or seven of these crates  immediately visible to you they have sheets put over them theyre different sizes some sort of  storage room there is a staircase that leads to the floor above  laura wait do they know were coming were just in the middle of their home now  orion yes of course vex they know were coming i showed them the amulet it was how we  got the sigil to come here to begin with its fine /none/ were doing business with them  itll be good  laura can i perception and make sure theres no traps around us just to make sure were just  popping in and this is a magic house am i right so i cant check for traps worth shit  matt room looks safe  laura great good great  travis well good lets get out of here  matt all right you guys make your way to the second floor as you step up to the top you can  see there is light emanating from the top of the /none/ staircase and a figure moves into the staircase a  stout dwarven figure this is the same individual you spoke to previously the dwarf steps to the  top and says with an air of annoyance to the voice all right waited up all night for you to  arrive and you never did and you come here and interrupt my breakfast  orion im sorry we thought you would like a nights sleep before we intrude and  matt its fine step up the stairs please and he steps out of the way leads you into the  central /dung/ chamber this house is unfamiliar to all but scanlan who turned invisible suddenly and  decided to wander in briefly  sam yes i did my old stomping grounds  matt the classic i dont know looking about its very wellkept its an old house the  ceilings are taller than you expect for a dwarf type home a lot of the ceilings are a little low  especially for you grog this ones built roomy theres actually a lot of cultivated cave plant  life a lot of boxes that contain various underground dwelling plants and other such  /none/ funguses the air itself is mixtures of sweet and pungent mixed almost as if theres a spice garden  somewhere and youre not really able to take a beat on what the actual interior would smell like  it keeps changing around you youre brought to the main foyer area and the dwarf turns back and  he says all right youve made your transference wheres the amulet  orion ill open the bag of holding and ill take it out before i actually go over and speak im  going to turn to scanlan and vex is he the /none/ same person who pays us for the other  laura no i should probably go find that guy or we can go all together  orion i just didnt want to say the wrong thing this time  sam sure dont worry you will  orion oh sorry here is the amulet and i show him now as far as trade as it was rather taxing  to procure this particular artifact  laura incredibly difficult he means to say  orion yes shes correct i was wondering if we could perchance trade it for a favor of your  /none/ arcane ability  matt its funny because i already did i gave you a permanent entry to my own household my  familys household by offering you this sigil that gave you entrance to the interior of our  wellguarded estate that was a trade enough that was what we agreed upon through the mirror  orion that was just to get me here quicker i thought  matt so you come into my home and try to extort me  orion no not at all heres what happened see we were on an adventure i pull out the carpet /none/  out of my bag of holding and this carpet was enchanted once with the ability to fly and it  helped us many times in many adventures it was dechanted i guess if you want to say it and we  need it rechanted and i thought that house thunderbrand would be a strong enough house to  have the ability to do such a thing maybe not as it seems  and i hand him the amulet as im saying this  matt he takes the amulet  orion and not as a trade but as a favor /none/ for just the effort or maybe because im not strong enough  as a sorcerer myself to do it  matt make a persuasion roll  laura people speak very very highly of your abilities can i assist him  matt its not going to matter you keep talking and as youre explaining this hes not even  paying attention to you the dwarf is staring at the amulet looking at the back of it where the  inscription is and you swear for a minute you see what looks like a tear gathering in the  corner of the /none/ eye of the dwarf who then reaches up and wipes it from the corner and takes the  amulet and puts it in the pocket and says my apologies thank you for returning this you were  talking about the carpet right  laura and orion yes  matt you want it to be enchanted  laura well weve heard very wonderful things about your abilities and not many people can do  such a feat  matt we have done a carpet before only one its very possible  laura did it look anything like this one  matt /none/ not this pattern no that one was more of a blue i mean this can be enchanted but the  materials and the time put into it its a very pricey endeavor  a carpet of this size especially  sam how much  matt were looking at the better part of a year to enchant this and thatll cost you about time  included thatll cost 50000 gold pieces  laura oh my god i throw my hands up i just cant i just cant how did we not oh my god  sam shes very fond of the /none/ carpet  travis i put my arm around vex and try and console her  laura 50 a year why thank you so much  matt well i mean there might be smaller ones you might be able to find elsewhere  laura no i know its a really beautiful carpet and it would cost a lot of  money to fix up i understand  sam she loves the handwoven carpets its just very tragic  matt all right well  travis shall we go get our money now  sam yes whos the man we need to see /none/ about that  laura oh thats the kraghammer we go to see  liam johnny kraghammer  laura johnny kraghammer  sam nostoc greyspine  laura it was greyspine  matt nostoc greyspine youre escorted out of the house thunderbrand make your way down to the  quarry at the very bottom level of kraghammer once again its been a long time since youve  been in this portion of the world let alone this city where you started this leg of your entire  journey you do make your way down into this area to lord nostoc greyspines proper /dung/ office the one  where you managed to procure his expensive wine and make this venture the very beginning you step  into the familiar halls as soon as you enter you have a brief discussion with the guy at the front  who recognizes you and leads you into the office there waiting behind his desk is nostoc whos  currently in the process of looking out the window over the entire quarry of his mine he turns over  his shoulder looking at the rest of you  well im surprised to see you all alive just assumed /dung/ youd all got yourselves killed like  the usual bumpkins who come wandering this far down in the mountain  laura no we did not die we in fact succeeded in taking care of those creatures  under dark carpet  sam shes that time of the month  laura oh excuse me we came to collect the money you owed us for completing  the mission you sent us on  matt ah yes of course of course understood what was the price we had agreed for that one  laura oh it was 30000 gold plus all the /none/ extras for the scalps that we acquired  travis i open the bag of holding and go here heres one brain chunk  and i dump it on the floor  matt as a note im pretty sure at practically no point in your adventure to the underdark did you  ever say you were scalping a creature  liam were above base  marisha we totally forgot about that  matt you completely in the entirety of that adventure didnt collect a single scalp from  anything you killed  travis i thought i grabbed the brain chunk i /none/ thought i grabbed an arm too there was just an  arm from the stitched guy and i just grabbed it  liam an arm is not a scalp its this  matt nostoc also looks at you and goes and while i respect your memory a dwarfs mind is  like a trap that you cant escape i believe the agreed upon price was 25000 gold pieces  laura oh it was that is so weird i remember 30  matt i dont even know what you fought if youre going to collect your money tell me what  /none/ the hell you freaking killed  laura mind flayers a beholder have you heard of a beholder  matt you fought a beholder  laura we fought a fucking beholder  matt really and youre all still alive  sam well no not all of us if youll recall there were more of us when we came down here and  some of us arent here because they died  travis i start pretending to cry  matt make a deception check  laura thats really good  sam 21  laura i start thinking about the carpet and i /dung/ really do start crying  sam so before you berate us know that we are mourning the loss of two of our members  and a bear  laura sobbing and my bear  matt beholder you say  laura it was really big  matt what else did you encounter  laura illithid  sam lots of illithid a whole city of illithid  matt a whole city of illithid  laura we destroyed half of an elder brain part of an elder brain  travis and there were all these dark  laura dwarves there were dark dwarves /none/ duergar  sam they were mind controlled it was crazy were not just making this up  it really happened  travis there were these wrinkled testicles that were walking around on feet  laura he almost died just from this one little brain  travis strange thing if youre stupid and it looks at you with its wrinkled testicle face  you go unconscious  matt i know the creatures you speak of ive dealt with my share of duergar though  orion i completely stayed away from it because i was terrified  matt make a persuasion check /none/  liam singing roll high  laura are we all rolling because were all talking  matt you were spearheading that part of the group  laura i was i thought scanlan was  matt scanlan already made his roll  travis what about giving her advantage because i was talking about testicles  matt no testicle advantage on that roll im sorry  liam in what circumstance would testicle advantage come into play  sam at gilmores  laura that would be 11  matt 11 looking at your number i can see that youve certainly encountered some dangerous /dung/ things  in your travels taken some losses and i will say since youve left we havent had at least  one excursion interrupting our mine which has been very helpful the fact that youve returned  with these tales i believe most of it id say given that circumstance id be happy to pay you  up to 18000 gold pieces  sam i am going to cast suggestion on him  laura 18000 gold in addition to the  travis hes casting  liam hes doing it  matt so whats the dc you dont have your hand /none/ cone  sam i dont have my hand cone out 17  matt natural one  laura money  matt all right what are you suggesting  sam im going to suggest to him that he is an honorable man and we had a deal and that he  should honor it to the fullest extent of the word  matt he looks about at the rest of you guys  sam i also as a cantrip oh god i hope its not concentration forget it im not going to  matt the greyspine name holds weight in this city /none/ the last thing i want is that that be  sullied by miscommunication if we agreed to 25000 ill pay 25000 but i hear a single  disagreement out there or a bad word that came from your lips about our exchange here and im  going to come for the rest of that money  travis i hold up the duergars severed arm and i curl all the fingers in  and make a thumbsup like that  matt he looks back at you very slowly as you do this with a tense stare laughs all right all  /none/ right and he starts bringing up coin purse after coin purse after coin purse counting it up  as he does it takes him about five minutes or so and eventually he counts out at your vision to  improve it 25000 gold pieces and platinum pieces and pushes it across to you guys youve retrieved  that no additional funds as no scalps were collected but you do get 25000  travis do you want the  matt you can hold onto that thank you  travis youre very gracious  laura singing 25000 gold in my hands right /none/ now thank you so much this wont make up for the  lost lives we have suffered but choking up it helps  matt im glad and im sorry for your losses perhaps youll be less stupid in the future  travis probably not we should go  sam remember the blood we spilled for your people and your safety  laura vox machina  laughter  sam oh i go to give him a business card but then i realize i never got them printed so  laura also gilmores glorious goods great work  sam yes gilmores if /none/ youre ever overdark come check it out its a great store  matt like an unexpected web popup he gives you an expression of where is this coming from  get out get out of my office  travis tiberius how do we get out of here quickly  orion i start going back to the chamber and ill do the spell again  sam can you do it again dont you have to rest  matt you can do it twice 6thlevel spell twice  orion no its a 5thlevel spell  matt what the teleportation  orion yeah /none/ its a 5thlevel spell  matt i think it is youre right  orion

furiously tying bows all through trinkets hair  the entire time theyve been gone  marisha actually ill help with that campaign i do some braids and add some flowers  liam keyleth has been weaving flowers in and i have /none/ been knotting braids started at the head  and then worked all the way down trinkets back and down the tail the entire time feverishly  taliesin i come up for lunch keyleth can i borrow you for a what in good god  marisha is it important do you need me right now this is pretty important  taliesin is trinket comfortable with this  marisha hes so comfortable look i gave him plenty of treats he doesnt even know whats  happening  matt sad bear noises this mournful low guttural groan youre pretty sure it translates  /none/ to why  liam i feed him a piece of chocolate at that moment  laura dont give him chocolate  matt he licks it off  taliesin keyleth can i borrow you when you have a moment  marisha ten more minutes ill be down in ten minutes  matt it takes about ten minutes before the keep doors open and the rest of your party returns  marisha and i run downstairs really fast  liam side note i let trinket give me bearkisses all over my face vex never lets trinket kiss her  face and its /none/ so sad and i let him just drool all over my face everywhere  taliesin i feel like were playing out some realworld psychodrama here  orion as this is going on i want to turn to scanlan and go gnome i have an idea that i want  to run by you no your names scanlan okay i was going to go and do this just on a whim as i  usually do but i was thinking that we should speak to allura and i dont think i should speak  to her alone  sam im sorry /none/ i must be asleep are you planning something ahead of time  orion yes  sam wow thats amazing  orion you know like i told vax you just have to chill out sometimes and im like well maybe i  should run it by the man with the mouth  sam well youve come to the right place i do have quite a mouth yes lets go talk to her  wait shes the woman you fancy quite a bit isnt that true  orion yes this is more business rather than denied pleasure  sam what do you /none/ want to speak with her about  orion well as far as i see it theres no other way to get our carpet reenchanted i want to  confess what we did to her and hopefully she takes mercy and helps us out with this as weve  helped her out far beyond anything that  matt at this point in the discussion you guys all look up and see sitting in the center of the  main foyer area of greyskull a very mighty bear brought down low sitting covered in pink ribbons  looking forward going distressed bear /none/ noises  sam see i told you it was a girl  laura trinket you look so cute  marisha oh i knew shed love it  laura we need to get these off of you immediately but you look really really cute and  i scratch his little ears how dare  matt you look over too there are traces of chocolate smears across the face of vax  orion vex no vex yes stand over and i use my still image and take a little spell of her  taliesin say it staffie just say staffie  orion /none/ no but its of her its a youie  travis but its with your staff  liam what is the piece of art immortalized upon a piece of wood  orion oh and i open my scroll of telescription im like see  laura oh look now i can remember this moment forever thank you trinket  lets go get you a bath  travis we got so much money  laura i go and put it in the party funds we got our gold  sam good job we can pay back gilmore  liam for my share just /none/ my share  laura are we splitting up all the party gold now  orion vex i give her the picture now you have a picture of your bear with the silly bows  laura oh thank you  liam and i take advantage of her good mood and say i just want 1200 gold and i wont ask for  any more of it any of the amount  orion ooh yes i would like the same thing  laura do you want me to just split up all the party gold right now  sam no i dont /none/ no just give us a quick stipend give us each 1500 and lets move on  laura everybody gets 1500 is everybody happy trinket are you just so thrilled  matt sad bear noises hes pulling them out with his claws as best he can  laura oh sweetie bath time  matt trinket stands up and heads out to the front courtyard all right so its 1500 times seven  laura ill do the math  sam lets go do our recon whos doing it  travis are we going to kill them  sam no were just going /none/ to go spy on them  taliesin id like to finish my morning crafting before moving into the evening crafting im going  to have help im working on project number three  matt okay this is probably going to take you the rest of the week its an extensive project  taliesin if i have a little help this is something ive been  tinkering with for quite a while now  matt right but its also the most complicated thing outside of the gun  that youve constructed  travis weve got a couple more days too  /none/ orion how many days have passed since weve been doing this two  liam percy you go to work well figure out everything else  matt its up to you  taliesin do you think ill have time to finish everything thats on my list if i roll well  matt probably not everything youll have to choose between a couple  liam what if he rolls a 20  taliesin because i was going to have keyleth lightning spell to help set the battery for the  matt right well that is technically an enchantment  taliesin if it /none/ just uses it to start a charge  matt oh to start a charge then you can do it  taliesin okay yeah i was going to frankenstein this  matt okay we can begin the roll now  taliesin all right  matt go ahead and make a tinkering roll  taliesin thats better 20  matt 20 okay not actually doing the charge yet because youre building the basis of the  structure you help him downstairs in his workshop with the various materials to begin crafting the  actual shell of the the item what else are /town/ you guys doing  sam lets go do recon  liam yeah what are we checking out though i mean its not like the briarwoods are out in  public we dont know anything about them  laura we need to ask around town about the briarwoods  sam we need to get into the briarwoods estate and talk to them  marisha well theyre not local theyre coming into town  theyre coming into town in five to seven days  matt no theyre arriving now in six days and arriving for the actual feast  sam wheres the /none/ feast to be held  matt its to be held in the palace  laura shit we cant do any spying  marisha not on them  orion all we can do is get gear and do things and we can sleep for a few days  taliesin you can help me in the workshop  marisha make a plan maybe make a plan we dont really have a plan  liam can you remind me and the group the dinner i know its with the briarwoods but who else is  it with uriel or who is it with /none/  matt its with uriel the council which is why you guys were invited also because percy asked  and the briarwoods it is partially to discuss and celebrate the agreedupon construction of a bridge  that goes across the shearing channel at the far northeastern side of the continent of taldorei  there is a large channel where these two large mountain ranges which are the closest the two  continents are to each other but its a very treacherous pass of water so any trade having to  be done has had to travel southward in a big /none/ arc around the bottom of the island or via  skyship both very expensive this bridge will enable a much faster trade route between the two  continents and whitestone has essentially been in charge of spearheading the construction of this  bridge and making this agreement with uriel that would be overall helpful for both continents and  since theyve agreed upon this theyve been invited here to emon for the first time to have  dinner with the council and uriel to celebrate it  liam we maybe want to talk to uriel  laura maybe maybe you /none/ guys should go because i want to spend the next few days training trinket  how to rolypoly roll forward and bludgeon people with his armor  matt laughs okay  marisha i mean the only thing i can think percy do you still have an idea of what the  briarwoods look like  taliesin oh yes  marisha i could attempt another scrying spell could even possibly  go to allura for help and try again  taliesin see if allura will come here because i want to keep working and ill also say we should  send /none/ word to uriel that i will not be myself at the  sam yes that might be very strange  laura we should maybe send word to him that the briarwoods should be watched  taliesin the less we say the better  marisha what makes you say that  liam you think uriel might be in the briarwoods pocket and pass on that were aware  taliesin it would not be the first time  liam thats true  sam yes even if you wear this disguise hat percy how are you going to get into this event  /none/ its a private event you cant just be some random person  taliesin i will be with you and if we can let uriel know that  i am coming under a false pretense  sam yeah but thats going to arouse all kinds of suspicion  marisha exactly yeah if we tell uriel youre coming as someone else hes going to ask why  taliesin he knows that i dont trust them  travis he does  taliesin he does  marisha wait who was it that came and talked to us who was that  matt that was /none/ seeker asum  marisha i was going to say it was seeker asum but he didnt say that uriel had his doubts he  said he had his doubts  taliesin so lets let asum know  marisha let asum know  sam why dont you disguise yourself as  taliesin burt reynolds  sam what about vax he can sneak in  taliesin will the hat let me choose who i look like  matt the hat like any minor illusion spell you can choose your appearance  taliesin how much of a shapechange can i  matt i /none/ mean you can look pretty close to somebody else  taliesin could i look like grog  matt you could but as it is an illusion there is no physical so if somebody were to reach up  and touch your shoulder it would just pass through  marisha right and your voice doesnt change so you probably dont want to try  and sound like grog all night  taliesin well i was actually thinking of pike but  sam ooh pike you could be pike you would be a very big pike  liam percival theres nothing i /none/ want more than for you to take bad news and unload it on every  one of those motherfucking shits but if youre me and im nobody if im a ghost i can help take  out one or two  taliesin youll stick to the shadows and ill be you  marisha not to be sorry you were going to say something  taliesin no thats actually a pretty good plan  liam how many days left  matt six  liam can i ask you a question dm i have in the assassin perks i think it says /none/ seven days i can  be anybody as long as i dont do anything else and i work on getting the right papers and no one  will know who i am 100 but its six days so am i shit out of luck this is why i was talking  about it yesterday motherfuckers  taliesin thats okay its a good plan i think this plan is a good plan  orion i think well be fine because i have privilege perk  liam you make me invisible  sam i can also do that or he can  /none/ liam yeah one of you two  sam no problem i know its a few days off but we should have some sort of safe word some sort  of attack word grog any suggestions  travis jenga  all jenga  marisha i like that were not hired to kill the briarwoods and not to be that member of the group  that has a golden heart and wants to ruin everyones fun i dont want to stand between you  and your revenge that you are absolutely owed percy but are you sure this is what you want /none/ is  this going to make you feel better  taliesin i dont know what i want i want to see them i want to look at them i want to see them  marisha do you want to talk to them  taliesin no i want to listen to them  travis then we follow your lead  taliesin i want to see them i dont know  marisha do you want us to fucking capture them and drag them back to the cell that we built in  our keep we built it for a reason  sam /none/ whistles she gambles now shes crazy  marisha i know ive been opened up to so many things  taliesin the best i can give you is well just have to see what happens  liam percival i trust you implicitly you have earned that trust do you believe them to be evil  in the purest sense  taliesin i do  laura and liam thats all we need  sam we dont even need that much if youd just said to kill someone wed probably do it  taliesin i saw things  laura should we prepare lets /none/ do it ive been training trinket though does that help  marisha ive been reading my alchemy books  matt six beard checks  sam i went to get business cards  matt right thatll cost you 25 gold for 100  sam im going to get two sets one says scanlan shorthalt one says burt reynolds  matt okay both have been constructed without question  liam i repaid my debt to gilmore  matt all right debt is paid mark off that gold  laura yes  matt how many is that  travis im at five total /tavern/ right 46 45 55 a one and a 95  matt by the end of this week you have grown what is a rather majestic full chinbeard you are  probably the first goliath to have facial hair its a full were talking portland man  sam oh no  liam another thing that i did was go off and get a lathering cream and the second to last night  after i took grog out to the tavern i bought him a lot of drinks  travis i assume dodge  liam i didnt shave off his whole beard /tavern/  only half of it  travis i just became the most handsome man in the world  laura do not shave his fucking beard off  liam this much  matt make a stealth check make a perception check you just broke a mechanical pencil  laughter  liam dm i rolled a natural 20 i have advantage on stealth checks and i rolled an 18 and a 20  natural 20  matt sleeping soundly drunk you do not hear the approach of vax as you pull out your blade and  get ready i want you to /none/ roll a sleight of hand check  liam after the 20  matt one thing to not be noticed its another to shave someones face without being noticed this  is about stillness of fingers not just how stealthy you can be  liam im using luck okay so i rolled a 21  matt roll a perception check grog with advantage because this is against your face  travis 13  liam 21  matt all right  laura why are you so evil  liam why did he trip me and make me eat shit two months ago /none/  taliesin marisha and orion oh  travis appetizer of things to come my friend  matt the crowing sound of a distant rooster the farmlands that surround the outside of emon which  are relatively close within earshot the morning sun rises cresting over the eastern skyline of  taldorei grog you come to consciousness stretch reach up to rub half a beard  travis half a beard like just one side of my face  matt one side of your face  travis i say in a low guttural growl  liam you have no idea it was /dung/ me  travis vax i didnt have to wake up to know it was you motherfucker  liam make an intelligence check make him make an intelligence check  marisha we all know it was you  travis i reach down i find a dark stone on the ground and i go over to the bare side of my face  and i draw a very beautiful mustache to complete the other half of it  liam he is dumb as a post why does he know  travis because youre the only fucking idiot stupid enough to do that /none/  liam magic is mysterious why couldnt you grow half a beard due to magic  travis maybe i dont know lets say i assume  laughter  matt however it is a new morning roll a beard check  travis eight four  matt no movement  liam sorry big guy  matt all right so as a note percy i want you to make four more tinkering rolls  taliesin all right  sam im going to give him inspiration for one of them  singing do you want to build a machine gun  taliesin singing why /none/ yes i really do  matt what have you got  taliesin 28  matt 28 okay second one  marisha oh god  matt dice going everywhere  sam inspiration d10  taliesin i got a d6 from the last one you did  matt d6 is what i gave you  taliesin d10 so ill roll a d10 with the next one that one was 20  matt all right third one  taliesin 28  matt all right and the fourth one  taliesin 23  matt okay so over the next few days youve constructed what /none/ amounts to a large metallic  gauntlet you have taken this gauntlet and wired all through it insulation and metallic insulating  tips in what is essentially a small for lack of a better term alternator of some kind  taliesin i was going to try to sneak in a few bullets during that time  matt the fifth rolls going to be that you have constructed this device the quality seems fair  its untested technology just something thats a brainchild of your own utilizing keyleths aid  keyleth im going to have you roll a wisdom check roll /none/ that and add five  marisha well add just my base wisdom  matt plus six it would be sorry  marisha yes plus six so 20 total  matt 20 total you step out and you set it down in the middle of the courtyard keyleth you  summon a storm that slowly gathers above the top of the keep you guys start hearing sounds like  rolling thunder outside and you come and look and you see percy and keyleth are out standing in the  middle of the courtyard keyleth with her arm in the air as /dung/ this black dark storm cloud begins to  swirl above the entirety of greyskull keep with that she brings her hand up and then brings her  fist down as a bolt of energy thunder clap streaks down from the clouds slamming into a  small object on the ground that then gets flung about 15 feet in a random direction tumbles to  the ground you rush over to grab it you can see arcing over the metal electric sparking these  small electric arcs you reach over and wait a second you prod it pick it up and /none/ its hot drop  it instinctively you give it a few minutes to cool off pick it up when its warm enough you  put it on and there is essentially this large sparking metal centerpiece that is giving off  this low hum  marisha did it work try it on tiberius  orion sure here  taliesin touch  matt okay tiberius make a constitution saving throw  sam and orion no  laughter  matt all right you suffer 14 points of lightning damage and are stunned for a round i need you to  go ahead /none/ and roll a d20  taliesin cockadooed yelps  marisha high rolls startle him  taliesin 19  matt 19 okay it stays intact from the force of it a little bit of the energy that was stored in  there appears to dissipate you figure theres only a few applications of this before it needs to  be recharged and every single time its utilized theres a low chance that it may detonate or  crumble or something bad may happen  sam percy thats amazing what do you call it  orion unintelligible mumbling  taliesin are you /none/ all right tiberius  marisha i go over and give him a cure wounds  matt you manage to eventually shake off all your muscles that were so locked tense  give way for a second  orion its effective  marisha that was awesome  taliesin i call it diplomacy  sam diplomacy  laura i like it  travis thats great  laura as were standing watching that trinket comes rolling into the courtyard  matt lets go ahead and make an animal handling check  laura oh why didnt i get more points in that  liam /none/ roll high come on  matt i say with advantage because trinkets been your companion for so long  laura natural 20  matt which is close to what you needed because this is a very difficult feat over the week  youve worked with trinket and youve worked on a technique where instead of a multiattack  trinket can do what is essentially a trample attack meaning trinket can roll forward and roll  through anything thats equal to or smaller and damage everything in that path  liam singing circus bear  matt well go over the logistics /none/ of that some other time but trinket has now learned a  rolypoly trample attack  laura should we call it the rolypoly or the cannonball  travis thats your call  matt its your call call it what you want  liam rolypoly is cute cannonball is  laura i think i like cannonball because its better to shout during the battle  matt the trinket cannonball  liam rolypoly  orion for brevity i rolled six dice i rolled the only high ones worth mentioning was a 13 a  15 and 18  matt with a 15 /none/ and an 18  orion 17 i mean  matt yeah  orion and the because theyre all negative three and i attempted to teach to lockheed to  hide and speak and to stay  matt okay to hide and to speak to stay did not stick unfortunately you had two rolls that were  high enough to get those two in there though hide and speak all right the morning has come to  fruition you have a few hours before youre supposed to arrive at the palace you have been  notified that this is a very /none/ formal event  sam well need fancy robes  laura oh we have some formal dresses already  matt roll again please  taliesin 23  matt you manage to construct 20 pieces of ammunition from 20 units of materials  travis we have three fancy robes  orion oh and ive picked up my glaive right two days it was time to  matt you go back to karin you now have  some kind of a knifeglaive thing  orion krull im naming it krull  matt you are unsure how it will work in combat but it /none/ looks neat  orion and i attach it to my coat  matt it just hangs to the side careful how you sit  liam do i still have the finery i wore to the velvet cabaret  matt you would yes  liam all right so we have to worry about you grog  travis are there any tapestries or curtains in the castle  matt there are actually  travis i walk up to the prettiest one and i rip it down and i throw it over myself like a toga  marisha laughing its pretty good  /none/ matt it in a foreigner in a foreign land kind of way could work  travis and i practice my curtsy because ive seen vex and keyleth do it  so i think everybody does it  orion i do it as well i dont know whats going on  taliesin i want to see him roll an athletics check for that  laura tiberius  orion yes  laura could you prestidigitate this thing and make it look like an actual thing  sam not for very long  matt thats more of an illusion  liam you pull /none/ the hairs out  travis whats wrong with this im from a strange land my customs are my own  sam grog have you washed yourself in water at all this week  travis no it burns  orion i do prestidigitation immediately to get rid of some kind of smell that im sure is emanating  travis i freak out running around the room screams  orion its not water grog and i keep casting it on him its fine see splash  laura youre fine  travis it must have been that powder you gave me before it /none/ made me immune  laura thats what it was youre immune youre definitely immune to water now good job  orion whats wrong with what youre wearing now  laura his toga hes wearing a toga made out of a tapestry  orion oh so ill go and ill use some of my dust of illusion and ill pfft on what hes wearing  and shape it into a fancier robe  matt from a visual standpoint the robe tapers and curls around his form and comes to look like  a nicer robe the material looks like its made /none/ of almost a reddish silk the actual imagery of the  tapestry slowly fades and becomes just various textures and material from your eyes its less  interesting but from a presentory standpoint it could be passable  liam dont forget his exotic facial hair as well that probably lends to the whole package  matt yeah which by the way you guys do see its half giant beard  and half scrawledon charcoal  orion and i notice this i go oh oh grog and i use a little bit more of dust of illusion i  wipe it /none/ smear it on there  travis i wipe it away  orion no stop hey hey hey i put it on actually im going to take it and im going to  actually put it in your hand and be like put it on your thumb and be like i want you to smear  this where the beard was and i want you to think really hard that you want it there okay so put  it on first there you go thats it and now think really hard that you want it there  matt the dust tends /none/ to glisten and where there was once charcoal outline a mirror to your once  beautiful beard continues full as if nothing had happened  travis i reach into the bag of holding and i take out a little goblet and i pour some ale in it  and i walk over to vax and i go here you go  liam this looks very good thank you grog  travis youre welcome would you like some more  liam no i dont want to cloud my thinking before we go up against the briarwoods  travis probably smart ill /none/ take that back i crush the goblet in my hand  matt this creaking metal sound the goblet is now destroyed  travis oh no what happened  matt all right dressed up you all make your way to the cloudtop district as the sun begins to  bring itself to the other side of the horizon as you approach the outside of the taldorei palace  there are general guards set up to accept guests theyre just there in wait as part of their  process today as soon as you arrive and announce yourselves as having arrived is /none/ there anything  you want to do to prepare  sam well are you in disguise yet percy  taliesin yes i look like vax  sam cloaked vax  liam where are we  matt you guys are nearing the palace right now  liam nearing the palace hit me  marisha i produce a few flower cummerbunds and start pinning them on the party  laura i go in and put my arm through percys arm to make it seem like were twins i go in with  percy to make it look like were the twinsies  /none/ sam im going to cast invisibility on vax  travis i hand the potion of climbing to vax and say dont die  liam no promises  sam youve got one hour until my invisibility is going to wear off so find a shadow  matt do you guys make yourselves known at the palace front  sam yes were friends here yes  matt as you approach you make yourselves known the guards lead you to the front area of the  palace the suns just starting to hit the distant side of the water of the ozmit sea /none/ to the west of  emon as you guys finish talking to the front guard that youve arrived seeker asum steps out  of the front of the palace and sees you very good glad you could make it please enter i will  wish to speak with you briefly before the event this evening  laura of course  matt are you missing anyone  laura oh yes percy wasnt feeling very well he ended up staying home  matt make a deception check  laura 11  matt very well thats unfortunate his skills could have been of /none/ use to me come inside  laura i pat vaxs hand percys hand what the fuck this is creepy  travis call him vaxy  laura vaxy  taliesin that will work just fine thank you  matt he leads you into the green meeting room you guys have had previous council meetings with its  currently empty he sets the guards to the side and brings you inside and says all right so if  my little birds speak truth they should be arriving around dusk so we probably have no more  than 20 minutes before they are /none/ here themselves if youre not aware they should be referred to as  lord and lady briarwood their names lord sylas briarwood and lady delilah briarwood  marisha sylas and delilah  singing hey there delilah  matt this is a political dinner please do your best not to cause a scene during the meal as i  need that time as a distraction to do my own digging  laura yes  matt vax  taliesin yes  matt youre light of step and quick to fade would you wish to join me on this or  stay with /none/ the dinner party  taliesin ill stay with the dinner party i wish to observe  sam he also has a bit of a cold  taliesin i wish to observe the briarwoods myself  matt make a deception check  taliesin gritty voice i wish to observe  liam youve got to go more nasal taliesin  taliesin yes nasal  orion yes you need to go down here  sam sort of like sandpaper on a chalkboard  marisha i should have done something about this  taliesin five  matt asum goes all right if we are /none/ to do this i would appreciate a little bit of honesty at the  front point  orion well im tiberius stormwind from draconia  taliesin its all right  sam this is not vax  taliesin asum its me  matt i gathered as much as soon as you began to speak now i can understand based on our  previous conversation that you have interest in keeping low key but know that i am an ally in  this if youre not here where is the rest of your party where is vax  taliesin vax is here /none/  laura hes stealthing  taliesin hes being quiet  matt well vax if you can hear me follow me when the meal begins i may have use for you all  right so the briarwoods have a very good relationship with uriel and the taldorei council  established back before they expanded outside of wildemount ive sent two of my best gatherers into  wynandir to seek out more information on them i dont know when that information will be  available theyve only been gone but three days and hopefully in time well learn more of what  /none/ their machinations may be many of the noble houses of whitestone were left vacant when the de  rolos passed and were given to friends of the briarwoods whispers that reach me speak of these  new nobles not being highborn nor affiliated with the gentry at all so im curious as to what  allies theyve made either before or after taking whitestone for themselves  marisha what are the names of these people whove taken over white  laura it was the briarwoods  matt i dont the briarwoods have  marisha i thought they said they had /none/ friends  matt i do not know yet ive sent folks out there those who have been sent to whitestone have  either defected or quit and sent me letters of resignation which is part of the reason i am very  curious as to whats going on in whitestone now ive also found the documentation that delivered  the ungoverned lands of whitestone to the briarwoods was signed officiated and cataloged  months in advance to the de rolo family passing im still following the trail but i find the  timing far too convenient with their arrival coming /none/ up please be controlled remember what  ive told you and as more information comes in in the passing weeks ill bring that to your  attention as well be observant listen pry what information you can but do not raise suspicion  sam we will be as quiet as a house mouse however if you need us to act just utter the  word jenga  matt jenga  marisha i also make a matching corsage and pin it on his lapel as well  matt as you do he looks down at it and goes thank you its /none/ not my color  marisha you know thats fine  matt i appreciate the offer but my theme goes with browns and blacks so as not to be seen this  is a bit bright for my taste  marisha it might have had a more utilitarian purpose but its fine  matt im not going to be at the dinner but thank you  laura do you have any of your people learning about the briarwoods are they magic users in any  way have you heard anything  matt the only thing i can recall as the information /none/ of the briarwoods at least whats  come this way was while they were ruling the lands in wildemount as part of their kingdom there lady  delilah briarwood was an accomplished practitioner of the arcane arts a longtrained wizard as far  as i know and been through quite a few different schools and had a brief stint here in emon  training at the lyceum but that was naught but nine ten years back maybe more  laura do any of you know as somebody practiced in the arcane arts are you good at seeing through  illusions /none/ or  sam who me who us  laura anybody that is you know very skilled  orion chuckles of course i just need to know that ones happening  so its tricky is what im saying  laura so she wouldnt automatically know they wouldnt be able to spot  immediately that percy is not actually  orion somebody would have to have rather powerful abilities to see through an illusion spell like  a disguise or such its like a rakshasa could see though that kind of thing per  experience i doubt that the briarwoods have any /none/  matt at which point you hear muffled in the distance a horn noise this horn sound that seems  to be blown as a notification that the arrival of guests has rolled in  travis are you ready for this vaxy  taliesin no lets do this  orion would you like me to cast fireball  matt asum goes no please none of that vax if you can hear me in this room ten minutes into  the meal see if you can spot me and follow me in the foyer good luck  laura great  sam /town/ keyleth i hope you phoned ahead and gave them your order for a vegan meal  marisha oh i always do  taliesin shes vegan of course she told them  marisha exactly its on the rsvp  matt asum leaves the room do you wish to stay inside  do you wish to see the guests as they arrive  taliesin lets go be social  sam lets go mingle  matt all right you guys head back out to the front of the palace the large stairway that leads  down into the central road outside of the /dung/ palace in the middle of the cloudtop district the sky  itself has now come to a dark purple blue slowly moving over into the distant sunset the sun has  disappeared beneath the sea and youve completed the dusk as the sunset slowly turns gold a dark  wood carriage flanked by four armored men on horseback pulls onto the road right before the  taldorei palace a young man steps from the front of the carriage and opens the door stepping out  you see a strong tall man in the nearby lantern light short brown hair frames /dung/ a very chiseled and  handsome face adorned with a well groomed goatee his clothing is based in blue and black fitted  elegance trimmed with golds and red a strip of grey fur cresting over one shoulder framing his  torso he turns extends his hand towards the door where a feminine gloved hand finds it a  beautiful woman steps out after her hair dark auburn and pulled up into a tight braided bun  resembling some sort of a glamorous school teacher almost her gown is in the same color scheme as  the man if a /none/ bit heavier blue than black and a long billowing skirt tapers up to be formfitted  across her body continuing upward to wrap her neck nearly to the jaw they both turn to face the  greeting party bowing slightly as two of their companion guards flank their approach up the  steps the other two helping the young man who steered the carriage carry their rather large bags  behind them this is lord sylas briarwood and lady delilah briarwood as you guys are standing here  at this point stepping behind you a hand reaches over and touches /none/ the back of your shoulder you  look behind you and there smiling is arcanist allura vysoren dressed in a very fine blue gown  youve never seen her quite so formal but very beautiful type thing she glances over the  shoulders its so good to see you im so glad you all could make it  laura so wonderful to see you i give her a hug  matt she gives a little hug too glances over at you a pleasure vaxildan  orion see she can see it  marisha yes she can  matt what are /none/ you doing  orion you look gorgeous allura and my friends are just making weird faces right now its  probably because of how beautiful you look  matt as you guys are having this discussion about 15 feet from you the briarwoods enter the palace  their guards enter with them theres been no pleasantry and very much an intended arrival none  of you are recognizable to them thus they make no intent of introducing themselves  laura we catch any of their eye at all  matt they appear to be looking about and taking in their /none/ surroundings but theyre both engaged in  a mumbled conversation between the two of them as they enter  marisha is anyone waiting to greet them  matt as you follow where theyre going as you walk into the main foyer area where you stand  there waiting carefully at the back there are a number of servants that have arrived and have  taken some of their bags and help them up the stairs there is one the head servant who is  there talking to them and you hear him speaking to them wait in your quarters be /none/ ready the meal  should be ready within the hour if you would be so kind as to prepare yourselves relax unwind  set up your rooms youre to stay for a few days at the very least but we shall call you when the  meal is ready at which lord sylas briarwood turns to him and says i greatly appreciate the  information just come to our room and let us know when the food is ready now come my dear  laura can i keep an eye on them as theyre walking to their room just as /none/ long as i can see  their mouths moving i can read their lips  taliesin i also want to scan their entourage to see if i recognize any faces  matt okay perception check perception check for you as well  laura do i have to perceive it i have a feat that i can read it  matt oh you do  laura yeah i have observant read lips meaning i can read lips from any language i can understand  matt thats true okay good to know  taliesin 19  matt 19 no they all appear /none/ to be run of the mill soldiers nothing no one that catches your  attention the young man who is helping them as they go through seems familiar but no one that is  jumping out at you right now someone you may have crossed paths with in the past but nobody thats  really been formally involved in your life previously maybe a denizen of whitestone that  youve crossed before when he was younger as they walk up the steps you keep an eye best you can as  they go you catch a little bit of conversation /none/ that seems to speak about how long the journeys  been thats all right well be in there soon to discuss and well be out as soon as we can we  wont stay any longer than we need to and thats the extent you gather as they continue up the  stairway as the next hour or so passes  orion i flirt with allura  matt okay do you want to talk with allura  orion i flirt with her throughout the hour  matt okay shes grateful for the conversation she laughs and shes very attentive to /none/ all of you  and excited to see you she lets you know that shes been caught in a little bit of the  bureaucracy in the city and despises that shes taken some time off for herself  for about a week or so  orion actually towards the end of that conversation i would like to bring up a specific  thing weve been having such a wonderful conversation  matt of course no of course tiberius  orion i think when things settle down a bit perhaps you and i and maybe grog and lady kima  /none/ can perhaps go out break bread and have some wine and such on an evening with each other i believe  my friend rather fancies kima what say you  matt well thats very flattering tiberius i appreciate the invitation i would say that  particular mix of company might prove a bit awkward  orion well of course if it was awkward nobody wants that  matt perhaps we might i mean if you would like to get some tea sometime  id be more than happy to  orion oh just you and i  matt yes kimas /none/ quite a ways off and i believe shes still in vasselheim last i spoke with her  and yes tea would be lovely  orion okay all right wonderful  sam you walk away  orion i walk away  laughter  marisha he got a date  travis is that carriage is the carriage still there  matt the carriage as far as you see is being led off slowly by the  servants to a side area of the palace  travis and the armed on horseback that were with the briarwoods when they came in  matt /town/ two of them are with the briarwoods and there are two helping  to bring their stuff up to their rooms  travis the four are with them  matt the four are with them yes  sam i jump up and give him a little high five then as an hour has passed i beckon to vax and  find a shadowy area  travis real vax or vaxy  sam real vax because my thing is wearing off buddy  marisha ive been scanning the crowd have i noticed anything over the past hour of any of our /none/  people any locals any council members who may be acting a little shifty  matt looking about the council is roughly stepping in and out of the area like theyre  getting ready for the dinner and arriving from the cloudtop district  marisha any of them breaking a sweat acting weird  laura yeah i want to check out this too  matt go ahead and make an insight roll both of you guys  marisha 22  laura 23  matt the two of you scanning over looking over there is lord riskel daxio hes an elven /none/ male  who was the one who is master of trade of the city hes the one that handled the ordering of  your keep when you first had it brought to your attention by uriel allura of course tofor  brotorus is there the female dragonborn paladin she seems generally just not happy about the whole  scenario and shes not armored shes dressed in what would be considered formal attire but its  not a dress its not a suit its this asexual formal outfit that looks like a robe but also like  a suit and she /none/ does not look to be happy in it at all just arms crossed at the far end back  against the wall just growling noises slowly stewing not wanting to be there you also see  arbiter brom goldhand who is the master of law was previously one of the heads of the guard there  within emon and then was then given the job of being the head of the watchful hall hes the  master of law essentially in the city thats right tofor is the master of defense that took  over for krieg after krieg was /none/ slain so those are the council members most everyone else there you  see are servants as time goes on eventually there is the ringing of a dinner bell down the hallway  and everyone turns their head and notices and steps over to the great hall of the palace where  the feast is to be given to you and other guests  sam as we move i release and then recast invisibility on him when i see that theres a  moment where everyones distracted  matt all righty so you rejuvenate the invisibility spell  marisha oh /none/ look tiberius they have bananas  orion oh  laura i can sense you you dick  matt youre escorted to the hall by allura she keeps chatting with you guys and asking questions  about how vasselheim was and is kima well she stayed back there she asks questions about why  pike isnt here and you tell her the story that she stayed behind and everything you make your  way into the great hall which seats a vast number of people there are five major tables meant for  like large feasts but there is one central /none/ square table in the far end that is by this giant hearth  this fireplace is probably a good six feet high and about 12 feet wide its a grandiose visual on  the far end of this hall and theres a long table right there set for about 20 people you dont  know if there will be that many there at the table but it can seat that many at which point all the  different members of the council have their seats around it you guys find your seats  laura can we get a feel for /none/ where the briarwoods are going to sit  matt with this many seats set its hard to tell but you gather  that theyre probably going to sit  laura are there place cards laughs  matt there are no place cards but there are two ends of the table  that have two chairs at each end  laura okay can i position myself when i sit to where i can see them  so i can read their mouths specifically  matt certainly you can probably sit on the center or the far end of the table looking /none/ in  their direction should be fine  orion can i sit at the far end of the table at the very opposite end  if not at head of the end  laura thats probably where uriel is going to sit  orion oh who  travis the king  orion oh not that chair  matt okay but adjacent to it  orion yes that would be rude i think  matt okay fair enough  sam i assume i sit at the kiddie table because im so tiny  laura theyve got a booster chair for you /none/ scanlan  matt they do have adjustments for gnomish guests is a way of putting it all right after  you guys sit for a few moments another servant steps forward and says please if we might rise  for our guests lord and lady briarwood to join us at the table  sam i am risen already im standing already  matt lord and lady briarwood now enter arm in arm slowly walking from the far end of the great  hall they make their way to one end of the table they both wordlessly sit down smiling and /none/  acknowledge everyone at the table theres a moment of silence and then another servant says  and would all please attention be given to our sovereign uriel taldorei the second and the  empress salda taldorei at which point the sovereign and his wife enter from the same  entrance point everyone stands up from their chair waits for them to get to the edge of the  table at which point they nod their head everyone gives a low bow you guys follow suit following  the social graces youre not familiar with but trying to learn as /none/ you go except for tiberius  you know this deal you all follow his lead on this eventually everyone sits down again tables  are pushed in by servants behind you youre like oh caught off guard by the whole experience  uriel looks about the table with a smile shoulder length brown hair and his chin goatee very well  crafted into almost a point now he looks about the table thank you lord and lady briarwood  for making the journey across the lands so that we might meet in person finally please allow me to  introduce /town/ our dining party and esteemed council of taldorei he goes around the table introducing  arbiter brom goldhand he is the master of law of our city and is responsible for maintaining all  of these grand people of our fair town in the realm of safety and order we have lord riskel  daxio he is our head of planning and construction has overseen many of the expansions  of the city and is a trusted friend of mine we have the arcanist allura vysoren one of my  trusted advisors one of the greatest arcane minds of all /none/ of taldorei and the overseer of all  things arcane within our city we have the guardian tofor brotorus a fierce warrior and  currently the master of defense in our city and hopefully for a long time to come tofor gives a  scoffs sound and everyone is put off by it but theyre also seemingly used to it arbiter brom  goldhand master of law my lovely wife the empress salda we have here within our midst as  well vox machina a team of intrepid adventurers who rose up and saved my familys life and very  /none/ well the city of emon and have since proven very useful to our territory grog strongjaw a goliath  of interesting dress but strong of heart and blade we have vexhalia halfelven maiden with a  bow as swift as the fastest eagle looking next he says we have here vaxildan blades quick and  eyes sharp not a whisper passes his ear ah there you are scanlan shorthalt a performer  known far and wide a wit as clever as youve ever seen his songs are whispered through taverns  across the land we have tiberius stormwind  orion /none/ im from draconia  matt hailing from draconia which he looks across to the briarwoods the kingdom you hail  from originally not being far off from draconia perhaps youve had some  dealings with the stormwinds  and the briarwoods give a nod yes we have seen them in the past weve heard many good things  orion were pretty cool  matt we have over here keyleth of the ashari if i am correct on that she is a denizen of the  natural lands and protector of all things nature within taldorei  marisha hi  matt /none/ there was one more  taliesin two and they could not be in attendance  laura yes ill  orion they were running around they got diarrhea isnt that what you said  sam yes  matt anyway welcome and thank you he reaches over and takes a small glass and clinks it with  his silverware the servants immediately muster up and start pulling glasses out and pouring wine  into everyones glasses and the conversation begins to naturally bustle about for this meal  immediately conversation builds in about uriel talking across to the briarwoods talking about the /none/  bridge he says now the uriel bridge i dont think the name was necessary but its appreciated  from my perspective now in this union between wildemount and taldorei do we have a confirmed  trade route between the two  at which lord briarwood returns this is indeed very true we are hoping that through this  passageway wed have means of rather quick trade between this kingdom and yours not to mention  this would allow for individuals to travel for carried parcels very quickly and were hoping to  establish perhaps a very quick means of /none/ communication outside of the arcane for those who  cannot afford these various luxuries  lady briarwood taps on his shoulder and says yes and by the way i dont mean to bring up a sore  subject but its come to our attention that apparently last winters crest there was an  attempt on your life and the table gets a little quiet for a second were sorry to hear that and  wish to express our  uriel puts his hand out and says no no its quite all right it was but a paltry attempt and  /none/ it was thwarted actually by vox machina they have been tremendous in keeping us safe and i greatly  appreciate their aid in overseeing my familys good fortune yes  liam while all this is going on can you describe are the briarwood couple together  seated next to each other  matt they are seated right next to each other at the head of one table across the way  liam i intend to be behind them but whats behind them like  matt whats behind them is just open space and servants theres probably a good 25 servants /none/ here  that are just like sitting there patiently lying in wait for  liam and behind the servants is a wall so theres lots of open busy crowded space okay  matt and tables theres like other unused tables in this great hall that are just out there  four other ones  liam all right im going to drink the potion of climbing that grog gave me and im spidering up  the wall and id love while listening to all this to make an insight check on them just as they  talk just for funsies  /dung/ matt to inquire about  liam just to see if they seem like sacks of shit  matt okay go for it  liam luck oh not that lucky this is going to be very low yeah never mind low very low  matt its hard to tell from this distance really at all theyre very charming you were expecting  this very dour dark evil couple from all the conversation but they seem nice they seem  earnest they keep to themselves definitely theyre definitely a very tight couple but nothing  about them catches you off guard as /none/ being anything instinctively twisted  liam its very hard to read them upsidedown  laura could i inquire to lady briarwood  matt youre saying this out loud the conversation comes to a halt she yes of course  im so sorry what was your name again  laura vexahlia  matt vexahlia absolute pleasure to meet you delilah  laura you as well i notice your dress is quite lovely it doesnt look like a fashion that im  used to seeing where do you hail from originally  matt we hail from wildemount its quite a ways from /none/ here the continent to the far east  laura really im not familiar  matt you should come by sometime we havent been home in a number of years having to tend to  whitestone but we have quite an elaborate homestead there wed love to have you come stay  with us if you ever find yourself in that side of the world  laura i would love to visit how long have you been at whitestone  matt weve been at whitestone for the better part of i cant even remember  and lord briarwood looks he goes /none/ best i can recall four or five years it was an unfortunate  mantle to pick up but weve done what we can in honor of the passed de rolo family  sam oh sorry  orion i was just going to ask you seem such a lovely couple do you have any children  matt we unfortunately do not it seems it was not in the cards for us to bear however we  consider many of our esteemed servants and house guests our extended family so we can leave a  legacy however we can possibly do so /none/  laura can we insight check as what theyre saying  matt certainly  laura i mean i know theyre lying out their asses fuck 18  matt 18 seems pretty earnest  sam lord briarwood down here hi  matt im sorry i he snaps and a servant moves a large like pig platter out of the way that  was blocking your head from his vision  travis you can move that over here actually thank you chomping noises  sam lord briarwood we may share a mutual friend or acquaintance of some sort my father was a /none/  prominent doctor and he may have studied medicine with a fellow that you know named dr ripulah  ripley dr ripley do you know such a person  matt yes actually dr ripley is one of our esteemed physicians in whitestone yes recently  come into some land herself although she has been on holiday for some time following her own  research as doctors are wont to do  sam are you close with her  matt i wouldnt say close but shes been a friend at times and she was one of the few that  came /none/ with us from wildemount over to whitestone and has helped us restructure and maintain and help  facilitate the blossoming of a city without a leader  sam she sounds wonderful well when you see her next tell her that my father  dr jeff shorthalt said hi  matt jeff shorthalt i will be happy to pass that along  taliesin lord briarwood i am not familiar with whitestone  how did you become caretaker of such a place  matt at which point one of the other council members goes um and puts his hand out  its /none/ all right and he pats the hand of his wife he looks over at you with a smile we know  not if it is connected with the disease but before all this occurred we became very close  friends with the de rolo family about ten or so years ago actually the first time we met is an  interesting tale if you want to tell it please  his wife goes all right all right so they were taking a brief vacation east to wildemount  apparently they had not traveled and they brought their family with them /none/ a whole gaggle of small  children they were coming this direction now our homestead is on the western outskirts of wildemount  so one of the first places you traverse before going into the kingdom proper however the  family the de rolo family had been caught in a bad downpour a storm that had blown in and made  travel rather impossible and apparently they stopped not far from our homestead they came to  our front door asking for shelter for the evening and we were happy to house them we gave them dry  clothes food /town/ for the night and well a rather fast friendship was forged as we quickly began to  notice they werent just rabble of the street they themselves were highborn as we were and in a  very dire circumstance so we let them in they stayed for but a week we showed them about the  western side of wildemount and let them on their way and since then weve had many different years  weve spent together as families going on various journeys and trips together but as time went on  we got busy on our own and /none/ separate ways and we hadnt spoken in a while they were in the process  of discussing the building of the uriel bridge about five years ago and we were going to meet  with them about pursuing this venture as a joint well when the disease took them the family  passed on we were surprised that they wouldve considered leaving whitestone in our name and we  couldnt say no at this point to carry on their legacy i felt was important enough let alone the  memory of that to carry on the building of this uriel /none/ bridge i thought i really wanted to  spearhead the wishes of frederick  orion that is so courageous of you do you want me to fireball her now  taliesin a toast then  matt a toast  taliesin to gracious hosts  matt to gracious hosts  sam lchaim  orion gesundheit  matt so uriel and he looks across the way and says one of our largest exports in whitestone is  timber from the forests and woods that surround whitestone and the alabaster sierras weve had a  rising danger in the surrounding woods it has /none/ made it proven difficult to export most of these  wooded goods if it is possible we would like for you to send some aid perhaps a small band of  soldiers to lead a strike into the woods  uriel looks across the way and says ah yes we can definitely discuss that i dont see why not  we are currently in peacetime and we have a reserve of soldiers we can send your way  marisha i mean were also free  sam oh yes  matt as the meal continues on more conversations arise a lot /none/ of bureaucratic bs anyone want to  interject anything or ask any questions  orion is allura there still  matt allura is there yes  orion as were eating im going to by the way did you ever perhaps finish making that extra  earring i gave you several weeks ago i dont know how long its been  matt allura looks glances over to the side and says yes its been completed no ones come by  to take it from me  orion i had no idea ill send someone  matt and as a note im /none/ about a month away from completing the sigil in the base mentof your keep  orion oh wonderful thank you thats so talented what flavor tea do you like allura  matt i prefer a mint or jasmine to be honest  orion noted i walk away  matt you step up and walk away from the dinner table chair scraping tiberius stands up in the  middle of the discussion and walks away from the feast  taliesin lady briarwood it is such an act of compassion to take on such responsibility as a  house such as whitestone /none/  sam tiberius get back here  orion you said walk away  sam no not every time  matt well thank you this is the first time weve been away from whitestone in many years  taliesin thats such a spectacular act of kindness and generosity would perhaps vox  machina also be of service to you  matt perhaps you seem strong of build and  laura we are handier than we look  marisha we killed a beholder once  travis just right out with it  matt that is an impressive feat young keyleth  marisha /none/ we should just lead with that  taliesin and we killed an illithid once as well  matt slain a beholder uriel you keep in the presence of some mighty heroes  uriel goes chuckles they are proven allies i mean if you utilize their assistance that would  be very possible may have something coming up that i could use them for myself but well  discuss in time nevertheless the meal continues she smiles and looks back at you  marisha can i do an insight check to see if that look at percynotpercy was  matt you /none/ can make an insight check sure  taliesin can you can you make an insight check i dont think you can  marisha she looked interesting  matt youre distracted by the pattern the brocade across her torso area  taliesin you know you could roll lower if you tried  orion i want to do an arcana check on them  matt what are you checking for  orion if theyre armed with anything that has arcane properties  matt make an arcana check its not so much something you can sense more than you can look  for /none/ symbols you rolled a 17 it looks like there are elements of their accoutrements that are like  any of you are carrying on yourselves theres a choker thats part of the outfit that lady  briarwood wears that itself does appear to have some tiny enchantmentbased markings across it  they are adorned in various protective magic but so is everybody else at the table  orion got you standard gear  grog lord and lady briarwood we are in fact quite handy  vax we also killed an illithid if i recall  taliesin i think we did /none/ did we befriend an illithid or kill it i think we did both  orion we befriended it it betrayed us and then we killed it  sam but enough about us earlier you were telling us about a poor family that came down with  that disease im just curious coming from a medical family  what was the disease that they had  matt they look at each other and give a sorrowful look we do not know we were only given the  information that the family had passed but a month or two after it had /none/ already occurred  marisha the entire family all of them  matt most of the castle seemed to have fallen to it as well  laura so dreadful  matt uriel says my condolences by the way i understand thats very hard  its all right the least we could do is try to carry on their legacy  laura i know how hard it is to lose someone very close to you im sorry for your loss  matt its appreciated he looks at his wife and she looks up for a second its all right  marisha im /town/ sorry im just a little confused if the whole family died of disease werent you  afraid to go into this town into this castle werent you afraid of  contracting this disease yourself  matt there was worry of such a thing but before whitestone castle could be entered we made sure  to send in our best clerics to rid of any existing possible lingering disease and to make sure to  remove any corpses or bodies that may contain it there was a period of time that we were worried  but after a few months we /none/ came to the conclusion that we were safe and thus we moved our way in  travis lucky for you  sam anyone care for some games of jenga  matt at this point the dessert has been brought out its a fine almost creme bruleetype dish  its delicious  laura are they whispering to themselves still  matt as part of the discussions there are a few side exchanges here and there the best you can  make from it is did you notice him  she says yes dont worry and tonight well stay and those are /none/ the only things you can make  out from the exchanges back and forth  laura how long do you plan on staying here lord and lady  matt well after this dinner i imagine a few days and well be on our way were merely here  to finalize the paperwork for the bridge construction she looks over and gives a nod to  lord daxio who gives her a nod back and maybe see the city for a while and make our way back  its too hard to be away and our nephew has been left in /town/ charge of this  laura do you have plans on the morrow i would love to give you a tour of the city  matt that would be lovely  laura wonderful should i send word how should we arrange this  matt where are you staying  laura we are outside of town at our own keep actually  matt

laura perhaps you can show me some more of your fashions i love your dress so much  matt oh well its hard to show you this here what you need to see is the wildemount fashion  district it is divine  laura sounds wonderful  travis i look at vax and i go does anyone want any dessert  orion gulping im having a little  laura vax you looked at vax  travis yeah vaxy the one that i can look at  orion do you want dessert now would you like this fireball /none/ creme brulee  taliesin im just fine  marisha whispered i dont know what to do now  matt the meal has been now wound down the dishes are being gathered by the servants the wine has  stopped being poured and now everyone settles in with sighs of a meal well spent the other council  members begin to excuse themselves uriel stands up and says my apologies me and my wife find  that rest is in our future please feel free to walk the halls as you see fit thank you again  lord and lady briarwood /none/ for joining us and were excited to continue this venture  good night to you all  marisha hey you should hunters mark them or something  sam wait no thats uriel thats leaving  liam whats the gentleman who realized that i was there

both stand up and then they make their way out through the main  great hall exit  liam im following  matt okay you gather across the ceiling as you go you watch them head up the stairway to the  second floor they head to the right down a long hallway a series of doors they come up to a  door /none/ where there are two guards standing outside the same guards that led them inside the  building and were riding on horseback  laura could i hunters mark him before they go in their bedroom  matt hunters mark is technically a minor spell you could try it  laura i mean theyre walking away when their back is turned could i do it when theyre not  paying attention  matt id say make a stealth check trying to do this subtly at the table  laura 20  cheers  matt you hunters mark which one  laura /none/ lord no  sam sylas or delilah  laura delilah  matt okay you mark delilah as she walks off you have a sense of where she is at all times in the  vicinity as you follow them they go to the door the guards open the door for them and lead them  into their room and then close the door  liam oh that fast all right how close to the door are the guards right up against it  matt not against it but immediately to the right and left of it  laura i dont /none/ know what else to do you guys  sam burn their room down weve got to find seeker assam or whatever his name is  liam i yank off my serpent belt and throw it as far as i can not as far as i can 20 feet and  set it in motion so theres now a snake in the hall 20 feet in front of these guys  matt all right you take it and you throw the snake let me check one thing on invisibility real  fast just because  marisha laughs yeah just snake flies /none/ down the hall  orion if he does an action it dissipates the spell its not greater invisibility so he goes  uninvisible when he does something  matt attacks or casts a spell its not either of those its activating an item you take the  belt whoosh fling it hissing the snake appears to the side one of the guards looks over  looks over at the other guard he pulls out his weapon and one of the guards steps over to where  the serpent is and starts trying to stomp it out and it nips up /none/ and gets some of the armor and  hes just stomping out the snake  liam so ones 20 feet away now  matt about 25 feet away yeah  liam 25 feet away and one guy stayed  matt yeah  sam kill them  liam i drop and im going to bean him on the head like his name is kynan  matt okay all right as you leap off the top you whoosh land on the ground  go ahead and roll an attack  liam okay advantage on
