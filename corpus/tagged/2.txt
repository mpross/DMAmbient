none	 this  travis lets get it on  matt all righty so to get you guys up to speed with whats happened recently the party upon  returning from their adventure in whitestone had a meeting with the council of taldorei where they  were able to provide information a witness and have the guidance of the now nolongercharmed  sovereign uriel taldorei to alleviate them of any wrongdoing in the briarwoods arrival in emon  months ago and reinstated their membership in the council dropped the charges that were  against them from the city of emon and the 
none	 party basically have now become once again lauded and  accepted within the city at the same time uriel going through a bit of an emotional breakdown with  his lack of seeming leadership in this whole circumstance it was discovered that the reason  his defences were improper was because there was an individual on the actual council who was a  traitor whod been working with the briarwoods and secretly a follower of vecna from what the  documents seemed to say however he had fled and the party decided to go ahead and probably do a  
tavern	 little better job than the local guard would find out if he was too far or not they found that  he was still in the city beneath the city and happened to correlate his current location with  the clasp the thieves guild of the citys current underground base which the party had  previously had a few runins before so making their way to the inn that houses one of the secret  entrances to the clasps hideout they encountered a band of traveling musicians doctor dranzels  wondrous performance group made their way the magical im trying 
none	 to remember what the actual  full term was on that one that you wrote for it  sam oh their troupe the troupe name oh man i wrote that three years ago i have no idea  matt i know i wrote it down in a document that i didnt print out but i will for future shows so  dr dranzel  sam well look it up on the break  matt yeah there you go it had a great performance troupe  sam magical mystery band  matt yeah thats the one and discovered a number of 
none	 past individuals of scanlans  performance history as well as a few new friends and got into an epic flute duel of which he threw  and in doing so being a man of his word gave the remaining gold coins in his pouch to a young  gnome  laura just the worst  sam it was worth it  laura was it  sam well well find out  taliesin its like a tom waits song  matt yeah with the distraction being successful the rest of the party snuck through the kitchen  into the hatch and 
none	 they had an encounter with the clasp after calling out to them within their own  hideout telling them that they were after this fugitive and not planning to do any terrible  business in the guild and managed to convince them to let them go about their way and vox machina had  a showdown with the traitor riskel daxio within his cell before he was supposed to be ushered out  of the city given a new name and essentially be given free rein in the world the party then beat  him down pretty hard and are 
none	 currently dragging his bleeding unconscious corpse towards the  cloudtop district to turn him in  sam right thats right hes not dead  taliesin its an unconscious corpse which means its technically  marisha and taliesin not a corpse  matt this is true i dont know why i said corpse  travis foreshadowing  laura oh no what are we going to do  matt a near corpse he is borderline corpse  laura mostly dead not all dead  matt so as you guys make your way towards the center of emon the central wall that surrounds 
none	  the cloudtop district comes into view and the front gates that face the southwestern side of the  city reveal themselves down the thoroughfare there you see the four guards that are posted at  that entrance notice you approaching and immediately two of them begin to come up to you  and youve interacted with these individuals a few times as your experiences here in the city so far  and theyve grown to recognize you just by appearance and you guys tend to stroll up as a  posse of confidence which draws their attention  marisha 
none	 fucking with my clique  matt exactly  taliesin were reservoir dogging it  laura sup  taliesin walking really slow  matt at this point the sun is setting its probably getting close to dusk you guys stroll up  and the two guards approach immediately can i ask you what youre doing here youve got  someone  laura we have a present for uriel open the gates  matt well whats the present  laura are you questioning part of the council at this moment  matt no if there is business to be done i have 
none	 to go ahead and put it up the chain of command to  make sure that im doing my job so i dont end up being lashed for my  laura of course darling and youre doing a wonderful job of it  matt well i appreciate that and id appreciate you helping me do my job if thats all right  laura we have a present for uriel open the gates send it up the chain of command  matt turns around and walks back the other guy looks back awkwardly and follows him he gives a  couple 
none	 hand motions and the gates open up to the inside of the cloudtop district  travis hes on the back of the bear right  sam the bear we left at home  taliesin the bear we left in the alley  laura he is with us what  sam next time next time  taliesin the bear is a necessity  groaning  travis we take him inside  laura wait a minute  travis and sam what  laura wheres trinket right now why isnt he on the set  sam where is trinket  marisha hes in 
none	 the alley  laura im getting him right now  travis no no no no come on  laura i know where he is  liam look sam what did you do  sam this is just like when david copperfield made the statue of liberty disappear  matt its just like it exactly  sam yep david copperfield feld  marisha its amazing because you can like hear her footsteps its like a cartoon  taliesin its like an ad for atmos surround you hear ticking noises  marisha its totally like a pixar intro  taliesin oh my 
none	 god  matt im excited for the prospect of watching this happen right now  taliesin nothing can go wrong this is a great idea  marisha no one help her  liam no one help her  taliesin she can do this  matt you got this laura you got this  ashley you got it you got it  laura help me can you see this  travis nope  laura travis move your butt ive got to get trinket through  sam travis can move hes not going to help you  laura please travis  travis 
none	 all right ill move ill move  matt this is a wonderful microcosm analogy for pretty much every session  laura oh hes here  matt yay well done  laura totally worth it is he good is he placed well you guys  travis sure  sam thats a good core body workout  laura oh my gosh im so strong  marisha this was the best opening of our show  matt whats your strength  laura very low  marisha we shouldve played our theme music over that  laughter  matt so pushing towards the central 
none	 palace the guards approach once again these ones a little  more stern than the ones you met on the outside of the district whats your business at the palace  sam again  laura we look we have a body over this bear let us through to uriel hes been looking for  this man super important  matt the guards look over at the bear  sam they know this man they should know this man  matt you found riskel daxio  laura of course we did  matt all right men  marisha but dont tell 
none	 him its a surprise its a present  matt the other guards begin to step forward like well take it from here  laura no no no no you wont  travis the fuck you will  taliesin we would like to deliver this personally as we dont know if he has any coconspirators so  it would be best if he didnt leave our immediate vicinity  marisha and we really want to see his face when he opens it thats the best part of giving a gift  matt the guard raises his hand and the guards stop 
none	 very well proceed inward steps aside  the guards separate and you can see theyre all looking a little nervous that they basically had  their job done for them its not going to do well down the chain of command in the very near future  you guys step into the palace make your way to the main hallway that leads to the central throne  chambers uriel is not there at the moment the guards ask you to wait you wait about five to  ten minutes or so before the doors open again and uriel is hastily 
none	 walking in sitting down on his  throne the rest of the council isnt present for this its just him currently and i believe tofor  brotorus the female dragonborn on the council with you guys  so as you approach uriel sits down his robes swishing about him all right it hasnt been too  long you requested my presence and i am here what do you need  taliesin vex this is all yours  laura oh well not all me this is all of us we found your traitor for you  matt really and he stands 
none	 up and the rest of the guards that came up behind you keep an eye to  make sure nothing weird goes wrong they step forward a few steps and bring him forth hold  him in irons chains now and all the guards go and pull him off of trinket throw him on the  ground facefirst he slaps into the marble flooring of the chamber  travis yeah  matt little bit of blood smeared across the ground as his face glides  laura yeah hes beat up pretty bad you might not want to  matt hell 
none	 survive and you can see now theres a look of pained anger in uriels eyes at seeing  the face of someone he trusted for so long the guards take the manacles that you guys already had  on him and chain his legs together they put another set of manacles across the back of his  arms so his arms are actually held in two places to the back they lift him onto his knees  and drag him up to the very bottom stair that leads up to the central dais where the thrones are  on and 
none	 hes unconscious head lolling about uriel looks down and wake him up  sam us  matt someone i dont care wake him up  travis i got it i walk over and i slap the shit out of him  sam you may kill him  liam oh hes dead  matt with a resounding slap sound riskel sends a spatter of spittle and blood that coasts across  the floor and his head shakes as he looks up at you you can see his teeth that were once  white now glisten with fresh blood across the entirety 
none	 of his smile  travis hello gorgeous  matt do what you will he looks up and sees uriel my liege what would you have of me  uriel takes a moment intensely staring at his face for so many years you played me and my  family you played the people of this city of these lands youve forsaken the name of your father  who plucked you from nothing how how can you live with this riskel takes a moment chuckles  to himself this throaty gurgle as hes still trying to breathe through the blood pooling in 
none	 the  back of his throat life is but a stage of our existence and when you all will die i will rise  again for i am his blood  sam you are his blood  matt uriel steps back up on his throne and sits down riskel daxio you have been found guilty of  treason by the peoples of taldorei i command that your sentence of death be held immediately  travis yes  sam sovereign if i may can we ask him a few questions before you do what you gonna do  matt quickly  
none	 sam hes talking crazy we should find out why right  travis whos talking crazy  sam he said i am born of his blood what blood  laura are you one of vecnas children are you one of his priests are you one of his  liam youre the chatty cathy get with the talking  sam i dont know what im asking  travis you never do  matt as you ask him that there are many parts to our one to him im but his blood but there  are many many different pieces that make the 
none	 whole  sam where are these pieces located  laura everywhere good answer  marisha so when you say you are his blood you actually mean more literally for once is  that what im getting  sam no  travis good question  matt his eyes narrow and he looks for a moment almost disappointed in confusion just kill me  now i grow impatient with this existence  travis thats not a problem is there somewhere where you would like to go after you die or are  you going to wake up right after you die  
none	 matt i guess well find out  marisha yeah and are you going to wake up like a baby so we have like 20 years before we have to  worry about you again  laura or are you like a zombie straight straight away up and at em  travis he might come back as like a dog  matt please please kill me now end this paltry existence  laura what if you come back as like a fish and then youre screwed and stuck in the water  travis yeah or like a penguin so hes like 
none	 a bird that cant fly and he can only swim  laura and hes stuck waddling around thatd be so sad  liam uriel as thanks for bringing you this gift we need to run grog out once in a while might he  have the honor of removing this shitstain from the world  laura unless of course youd like to do it yourself  matt uriel contemplates for a moment hes at your disposal i only ask that you do it soon and  in my sight  sam are you sure theres no more useful information we 
none	 can get from this man  liam so riskel grog can do it kind of quickish or take a very long time ive seen him do it  travis and i start stretching  laura digit by digit  liam you can be sent on your way to whatever asshole you think youre going to but he can make  it very uncomfortable  laura he could strip you of all your limbs and leave you hanging not dead  liam i once saw him kill a man with his taint  sam with his own taint  matt roll 
none	 an intimidation check  travis the taint intimidation  liam so juicy  laura ew  travis like balsamic vinaigrette  taliesin ive wanted to make this pun my entire life  liam intimidation you said oh hell im using luck in case i can do better no 17  taliesin he taint intimidated got to get it out of my system im so sorry  matt you can see his eyes begin to roll back in his head do what you must begins to fade back  into unconsciousness  laura no no no wake up wake up wake 
none	 up whats the marble whats the little ball whats  it do  matt i dont know what youre talking about  laura oh then youre not very knowledgeable are you i guess vecna didnt tell you of his plans  not very important blood  matt the deal with my master is power through not knowing he is the one who knows all the fact  that he keeps it from us means that he trusts us  laura thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard  liam all right grog take off his little marble please  sam 
none	 wait wait wait wait were not going to get any information out of him  travis well maybe we should have pike cleanse his blood so he wont come back after he dies  laura thats a good idea pike why dont you bless him why dont you make him holy  matt his eyes dart around for a moment with a look of sudden curiosity and worry  ashley oh i think that would be fun  matt thats not possible  laura yes it is sarenrae could always use new servants right pike  ashley yes of course 
none	  taliesin ive seen her regrow a foot its amazing  matt deception check  laura aw okay ooh which one all right all right  liam the good one  laura aw thats not the good one 11 do i get advantage because pike is helping  matt because she is helping with it and she is the source of it id say sure go ahead and roll  with advantage  laura haha thats much better 23  matt 23 okay you can see now at this point his breathing is quickened and hes swallowing more  regularly 
none	 theres a look of sincere nervousness in his eyes his power is great there is nothing  this paltry little child of a being can do to keep his will from his promise  liam oh you shithead  ashley well maybe well just give it a try  travis do it do it  ashley okay well im going to walk over to him just stay still its better on the light side so  hold on  taliesin it worked for me it was really quite an experience  matt master have mercy  travis youre looking in 
none	 the wrong direction  laura i mean do you know unless you have something to share with us do you know of his  awakening  travis we could just let you go to him  laura do you have any details something that could lead us to him your god of secrets  liam no hes too strong fill him with holy light pike do it now  laura youre right and then hell help us for sure  ashley yeah because maybe hell remember and tell us  laura yeah  ashley okay wait am i doing greater 
none	 restoration  matt if you want to its whatever you want to try  ashley lets try it  matt okay so as you pull out your symbol of sarenrae your metallic clinks of your feet across  the sparse marble flooring you approach as the symbol glows you can see in pikes eyes her  pupils go white as the energy of sarenraes holy blessing begins to spill out the sides at each  step riskel begins to twitch and pull away hes glancing about looks towards you grog with a  look of please have pity as pike 
none	 reaches out to touch him he goes i know little it is the  nature of his being the ritual was once attempted before i know not if it worked i was not there  you rushed in it was not time   laura what did it need what would have made it time  matt the winters crest the festival marks a time where the barrier between the realms is thin  where the magic ley lines across this world cross and swell you forced our hand i was not there i  do not know the answer 
none	 and i hope it was enough  laura it probably wasnt  sam are there plans to attempt this at the next winters crest that you know of  matt at this point you can see now this look of despair hits his eyes and then resolve he goes  from this fearful moment to the realization that he has already expressed more than he should but  hopefully its not too much to fall out of the favor of his lord and a smile creeps across his  face for the first time since this whole thing and he 
none	 grins it is time and he leans forward and  puts his neck out  laura vecnas going to be so pissed at you  marisha have we tried to restoration him first  sam oh yeah she didnt do it yet  marisha she didnt do it yet right  matt did you want to cast the spell on him  laura and then well kill him  marisha yeah  ashley should i do it  sam why not well see what happens  liam so i crouch down take two fingers and i get him by the 
none	 nostrils and pull back the top of his  head and say do it pike pour in your holy light right in his mouth give it all to him  matt pike as you reach forward you take the sarenrae symbol and you jam it into his open mouth as  it does yeah just like that a burst of divine light comes spewing out the sides and you see him  choking on some unseen force  marisha a holy dick  matt probably a combination of him swallowing his own tongue but as you pull the symbol back 
none	  completing the spell of restoration you can see the energy pour through his body and hes shaking  out of fear his eyes begin to roll back and from the sound of it hes actually swallowing his own  tongue  laura oh did it kill him did greater restoration just kill him  matt hes choking  travis hold on hold on and i stick my fingers into his mouth and i grab his tongue and pull it  down to  laura oh gosh this is so terrible  liam this guys an asshole  laura i 
none	 know i know  taliesin thats a big hand to get in there man thats really uncomfortable  liam he earned this grief  matt you hear uriels voice behind you say enough get it over with  laughter  laura sorry sorry  sam all right good try pike that was really good  laura that was really awesome pike  travis nobody else has any other questions  taliesin just keep it clean so we can burn everything afterwards  ashley wait what happened to him  travis i take out craven edge and i step back and 
none	 with a huge swing aim right under his trin  laura trin  matt trin as the blade is drawn from grogs back you can see it draws this trail of shadow  behind it almost through the slow arc as he rears it back for the swing as the blade with a flash  impossibly fast arcs its way across riskels throat you can see his eyes open up with a sudden  realization as the moment of pain and death hits him then a smile draws across his lips as the  head slowly rolls back the blood 
none	 then gouts out with the last pumps of his heart his body slumps forward  the guards holding him as they can spilling a pool out in the center of the floor  laura oh jeez uriel  matt as this happens grog you feel this wave of exhilaration this almost ecstatic pulse of joy  comes across your body this sense of taking his life with this blade the first time youve really  actually used it was delightful  travis ive got goose pimples was that good for you guys or what  sam i dont know if 
none	 you should be smiling this much you just killed a man have a little  respect  travis yeah but he was evil not happy time  taliesin quiet happy time  matt uriel stands up guards have this mess cleaned burn the body thank you very much  taliesin really quickly have we looted the body already  laura i feel like i did didnt i when he was in  matt you did you already looted the body  marisha we did we already got the skull with the missing eye  travis can i turn to the 
none	 side and go how was that  matt you hear the voice creep up and say now we see eye to eye  travis i dont see you anywhere  laughter  matt the aura of the shadow from the blade retracts and the blade becomes an onyx blade it  appears to have rescinded his presence  travis hes shy  liam im sorry but its like the odd couple  laughter  sam craven edge and grog  ashley oh man i so badly want to fix that sword to save grog but at the same time i 
none	 dont  laughter  sam sovereign  matt yes  sam you know i know we just talked earlier today and everything but it feels like we should get  some sort of reward or something for capturing this guy doesnt it i mean is that impolite to ask  travis we did do it pretty expediently  sam it was the same day wasnt it  matt it was and he sits there for a second and nods his head very well we were prepared to put  out a bounty for his arrest and i feel it would 
none	 only be fair to provide you with this bounty he  snaps his fingers a guard comes up and he whispers to him for a second as he walks away  you will have a sum of 5000 gold pieces delivered to greyskull keep this evening  sam thank you  matt i appreciate it now please be on your way i have business to attend to thank you very much  taliesin good evening your lordship  matt he gets up and walks away  travis 5000  laura feel like it could have been more honestly whatever  
none	 travis really its a lot  laura should i add that now or should i wait until it actually gets delivered  sam probably when it gets delivered it could be intercepted and stolen on the way  taliesin a lot could happen  travis why would you even say that why would you even put that out there  laura what should we do should we go home then  sam i suppose so its been a long day weve taken damage today we should go home  ashley yeah we should go heal  travis wasnt there something 
dung	 we were going to do though  marisha what time is it  matt by now the suns probably set and so as you step out of the palace you look up at the  skyline little plumes of clouds throughout but you can see the distinct bright oranges and  purples of sunset have taken and to the far east you can see the dark blue of creeping night  liam how long has the sun been down  matt it just set its heading toward dusk  liam who wants to get a drink  marisha yeah  
tavern	 sam we were just in a tavern all day  marisha yeah but that was work  travis we werent really drinking we were pretend drinking we could be real drinking  marisha were we supposed to be pretend yeah sure  laura now the door incident really makes sense if some of us were really drinking in that  tavern  travis that or we just hate doors lets go get a drink  taliesin im all right with that  sam same tavern  all no  marisha lets go to old faithful wheres old faithful  matt 
none	 old faithful technically would be the laughing lamia which is where you guys originally  stayed when you first came to emon  taliesin lets do faithful  travis or do we want to branch out  marisha find a new place  travis yeah taste some new ale  taliesin lets start a pub crawl  taliesin and marisha pub crawl  laura i like it a lot  travis you are a smart one  laura whats the closest pub here  matt whos leading the pub crawl  sam wait hold on highpitched cries  im yelping 
none	 it  laughter  sam no  taliesin i feel so much better for every terrible thing ive said oh my god  laura that was the worst one youve ever said  laughter  laura youre going to lose experience points for this  travis i feel like my intelligence went down one  matt theres no ruleset for reverse inspiration but im going to start looking into designing that  liam the entire partys intelligence goes to one  taliesin you get a 1d10 bonus against a roll versus him its to knock him down a peg  
town	 matt its like the fate chips system its great okay so whos heading the pub crawl  taliesin am i heading the pub crawl  sam you dont know this town who knows this town the best  laura none of us know this town  marisha i mean its technically our town we should get to know our city you guys  taliesin all right im walking in a direction  matt all right go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin all right im going to use a different die because its funnier that way thats an 
town	  eight  laura oh good  travis you cant really do this wrong  matt youd be surprised  laughter  matt over the next couple hours you meander a while through abdars promenade there are a  couple dives but the clientele doesnt seem very jovial  laura this is the worst pub crawl ever this took two hours  matt yeah you find about four different establishments but most of them appear to be less  of the party hardy crowd and more of the my life sucks i need alcohol crowd  taliesin scanlan scanlan i 
none	 feel we need you im still recovering my spirit here  sam all right  do you need me to yelp it again all right i will roll an investigation  taliesin it couldnt hurt  sam all right let me talk to some people and see if i can find some things investigation 18  matt 18 chatting around  sam wheres a good place to go im looking for a speakeasy something off the beaten path  matt something off the beaten path word of mouth type place okay lets see  laura oh i like that hes 
none	 checking out his yellow pages  liam matts thinking about all the battle maps he drew over the last week and were doing a pub  crawl  taliesin its like fine were doing a pub crawl  matt hey man nothing wrong with that  sam or just a place that comes highly recommended  taliesin or poorly recommended  matt so you eventually hear about a place called howarths howarths  marisha like hoa  matt howarths  laura have we been to howarths  liam he just made it up weve not been there  marisha like 
none	 woolworths but halworths  matt sure  ashley like hogwarts without the g  matt i guess youd say howarths when you get there it appears to be more of a textile  business but from what youve heard its more a business that runs the front and then the real  company is in the back  laura nice  taliesin textiles and beer  matt yes  taliesin okay  matt so as soon as you guys approach the guy whos running the front whos this  weasellylooking mousy gentleman in his late 40s thin john waters mustache 
none	 gives you a nod and  says i take it youre not here for the yeah just around the corner back room points you  over as you guys walk in theres a pretty happening establishment in here theres a harp  player on the far edge of the room on the stage whos playing a very beautiful piece even though  shes just playing the harp its almost emanating the sound of multiple instruments theres  probably about ten or so people in here its not extremely crowded but everyone in there appears  to be rather upper crust 
town	 folks that either have descended from the cloudtop district to rub  shoulders with the less elite of the town and a few wealthy merchants its a pretty decent place  for rabble rousers who have some coin to spend  travis thats us  sam lets get a round shall we  laura yeah oh i would say you could buy scanlan but you have no money  sam you gave me a thousand gold  laura i did so you have enough to buy for everyone  sam im feeling generous ill buy us a round  matt 
tavern	 all right you guys get a round of drinks you look over the events of the previous weeks  you chat amongst yourselves and you meet a few individuals in the establishment and make a few  friends overall its a pretty decent way to finish a rather long day of more work than you had  originally anticipated as the buzz begins to wear off and the evening draws to a close you guys  find yourselves getting a little hungry and this place is pretty much solely a bar experience as  opposed to a straight pub and 
none	 its probably pushing close to 11  sam should we go home  marisha no guys the evening is our what do they say about things like that the evening is  our oyster right isnt that what they say  laura sure  ashley yeah close  marisha what  ashley no i said its pretty close  marisha oh thank you pike lets stay out all night come on  liam come on old man  marisha we can see the sunrise we never do this we never take time for ourselves  laura oh no keyleths been

town	 old disney cartoon way its hard to really put into words his hair is spotty in places its  thinning in the front but hes welldressed its one of those things where the outfit does not  match the persona but he looks over to you and well sir at this point in the evening food  might be a little hard to procure unfortunately  laura oh really  matt as far as i know  marisha guys theres got to be like some street vendors come on  taliesin im going to find the most interesting boisterous clientele 
tavern	 in the bar and im going to  approach them  travis yeah we getting in a fight  taliesin no  liam not yet  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin thank you for that yes thats much better 20  matt okay as youre glancing about and youre talking to the bar and the rest of you guys are  finishing a round of drinks you are looking around  laura i just remembered 5000 gold is being delivered to the keep  sam dont worry we have servants  marisha we have 
none	 servants its fine  travis drink more  matt so you glance towards the door and an individual walks in that definitely matches the  expectation of what youre looking for a familiar individual a gentleman of purplegold trimmed  robes a darkish complexion a tied goatee and a smile on his face and it suddenly makes complete  sense this is the kind of place that gilmore would go to drink  cheering  matt as he comes strolling in he has a smile on his face you can see a bit of sweat on his brow  hes 
tavern	 had a long day and is in a rush here looks over and immediately sees all of you there  well isnt this the luckiest day for me  taliesin and marisha gilmore  liam look at this motherfucker right here  matt vaxildan he runs up and grabs you and kiss kiss  liam oh i lift him i lift him in the air and twirl him around and i put him down on a bar stool  and i give him a playful slap on the cheek not that hard but like how are you its so good 
none	 to  see you god you look good  matt you as well my friend you as well  marisha gilmore gilmore what are you drinking were buying what are you drinking  matt oh obviously whatever shes having  liam do you have any food they dont have any  matt they dont have any they would not serve food here no its a finer establishment  laura where can we go for food gilmore  matt um and he thinks for a second he reaches back into a small satchel he has at his side and  he 
none	 pulls out a little pouch he opens the pouch and he reaches out and he pulls out a small wooden  domino like in size if you wouldnt mind clearing some of these tables for me  sam oh sure sure grog  travis not a problem stand up you lot  matt laughs unnecessarily knocking over the drinks off the table of one of the nearby  individuals but they dont argue with the goliath  travis its clear laughs  matt takes apart some room he gives a nod over to the bartender who you can see theres 
none	 been a  rapport here so hes like all right ill allow it he tosses the wooden domino on the ground for  a second whispers something under his breath does a hand gesture and it suddenly extends into  a wooden table into a familiar sight this is a heroes feast  cheering  sam gilmore  marisha these things are not cheap  ashley gilmore  matt you can see in his other hand the gemencrusted chalice from the middle of his pouch  dissipates in the arcane energy he says well i figured it was a special 
none	 occasion  laura darling  sam wow gilmore this is too much really this is amazing youre such a kind generous soul  matt actually ive gotten word that youve been spreading the wonders of my brand though  travis laughs thats true  laura everywhere we go  matt thats not true but youve been doing it a bit which is more than i expected to be honest  so i appreciate that i really do  sam not only that weve i dont know if word has reached you yet but in whitestone were  working towards establishing 
none	 a gilmorethemed library for the people with your name attached to it  matt well  sam something respectable for a change  matt oh i dont know about that ive still got to finish building my shop in westruun but when  that is done ill be more than happy to look into it  sam if you need any help count on us  matt whitestone whitestone hmm place has been kind of dour as of late  laura upandcoming i tell you that much  taliesin really turning around really turning around  liam you can turn 
none	 a coin and do right by the world they are in need and that place is going  to explode im telling you can i get another drink please  marisha theyre even changing the name theyre making it more hip its going to be called whisto  now its great just shortening it  taliesin another for her as well  sam shes had one drink  marisha this is great  travis when do we tell her thats a shirley temple  laughter  marisha look its been fermenting for a while  travis so hammered off this 
tavern	 cherry juice you guys laughs  matt so as the drinks continue to flow you guys swap stories you converse the evening is drawing  closer to like the 130200 in the morning at this point most of the other patrons have  filtered out of the bar the heroes feast after finishing being consumed itself has reverted back  down to the wooden domino which is a different enchantment to what youre used to your more  druidic divinebased heroes feast you summon out of the actual element this is almost an implement  or a focus he uses 
none	 for the spell each time its a different way of getting the same effect  interesting to you not being an arcane caster but nevertheless as it winds down a bit you guys  are all finding yourselves settling in  laura can i sit down and talk to gilmore for a moment  matt of course  marisha and keyleth gets up and moves and sits next to vax  matt okay  sam i go and challenge grog to a dart game  travis yes  laura gilmore  matt yes my dear  laura we ran into 
none	 a really weird thing in whitestone and i bet you know some shit about it  because you know shit about everything  matt weird things in particular is that what youre insinuating  laura kind of yeah  matt all right fair enough  laura vecna  matt the moment you say that you see his jovial exterior harden for a second and his eyes close  and he goes thats a strange name to bring up this late in the evening  laura bad news bears right  matt yeah  laura yeah yeah i kind of almost 
none	 died laughs because of him i guess  matt almost is better than actually so congratulations  laura thank you but yeah theres a spinning ball of death really an orb that sucks things  into it its black its underground we dont know what to do with it really and im kind of  worried i guess about it  matt spinning black orb of death  laura they were trying to wake him up but they said it was too early they did it before winters crest  matt he thinks for a second and says the only 
none	 orb of spinning death im familiar with is a  sphere of annihilation but those are generally a bit larger than what youre describing to me at  the very least  laura well i feel like maybe they wanted it to get bigger i dont know oh oh there was a  hand and an eye and  matt those generally follow around the phrase vecna  laura oh really  matt i dont know too much other than what ive been told historically and bits of information  that ive picked up through the years vecna and he 
none	 thinks for a second he starts looking  about if anyone else is near the table you guys are off and throwing darts  taliesin im listening in  matt okay  taliesin pike i dont know where you are but i assume youre still  ashley im listening im listening  matt okay vecna he has many names historically the archlich the whispered one the  dying king the lord of the rotted tower the undying king gods like titles it seems a bit  arrogant in my opinion from what i heard he was born a mortal used 
none	 his capabilities to attempt to  cheat death in every way possible and then once that was acquired naturally went on to the next  great endeavor becoming a god he attempted to ascend six hundred years ago but in that time his  cult expanded across the rebuilding civilization nearly achieved it until it seemed that the  remnants of good in society went and followed him to his place of worship and thwarted his ritual  he was slain but as youve seen when entities of such power get to a certain point death is but a  
none	 hurdle you have enough individuals that believe youre a god that willpower is strong enough to  keep you enduring so his influence exists and has for many years i dont know if hes a god per se  not yet but there are those that treat him as such and that in itself is dangerous because that  means hes probably still out there and im pretty sure hes very interested in finishing what  he couldnt before  laura what was he just trying to be a god is it  matt thats all ive heard not a 
none	 scholar of the religious rites and for the most part a lot of  his historys been well destroyed and kept secret its his bailiwick  laura its his thing well  matt but anyway if youve indeed come across any of this foul business i recommend you stay  far away far away bad news  laura bad news  matt yes anyway sorry dour subject didnt mean to bring the mood down on that one  laura dont worry it helped helped us  sam well its been a fun night guys but im tired of letting grog 
none	 beat me at darts  travis you really suck i dont know if its because youre so tiny  sam they put the dart board so high on the wall  travis yeah but you put darts in two peoples arms i mean are you really that  sam well one of those people was giving us the stinkeye  travis thats true he squealed out like a little girl too  sam but we should go home  marisha what  sam we should go home  marisha noooo  sam keyleth please dont be this way well go

none	  little gnome takes it in her gut grins wipes the edge of her chin looks over to grog with a bit of  a challenge look on her face grog you look over to keyleth and both of you guys start slamming  down the line as you hit that fourth one you can feel the burn on the inside you a little bit of  that heroes feast begins to creep up and you get that acidic you know  travis salsa  matt have to stop a little bit take it back down but youre good  
none	 travis little mild salsa  matt but youre good you kick it back as soon as you open your eyes youre like you look over  across the way and all you see is keyleth her expression go from a big smile to neutral to a  worried frown looking to the door  sam shes going to shes going to take hit points  marisha i got to go outside i got to go outside  laura i got her i got her  marisha i got to no no no no  travis no shes got to stay

none	 attend  to in the morning  liam im sure you do could i borrow your ear for a few minutes  matt certainly it would be my absolute pleasure  sam you want some privacy  liam in private  matt oh far be me to stand in a way of a private conversation  and he stands up for a second and walks over to the far table in the corner right by the stage  where the harpist was playing but is no longer on the stage he sits down expectantly waiting  laura can i watch 
none	 this conversation from the doorway  matt well if you guys are the doorway leads into the textile portion so if you guys arent  leaving the place entirely  marisha well i figured we were just outside the door  taliesin if you want to hang by the textile ive taken her all the way out  laura im just going to hang out and watch in  matt okay keyleth make another constitution saving throw  taliesin this should be fun  marisha no that one cursed me before that one was bad lets do this one oh

none	 i feel i need to be honest  with you theres no question you and i have danced around each other a bit in the past few  years and i have been curious  matt well curiosity is the spark of arcane pursuits and knowledge among many other things  liam ive come close many times to going further than i have you are a charming man but i respect  you very much and i need to tell you that i cant do the dance anymore i am in love with someone i  dont think loves me 
none	 but all the same it wouldnt be fair to you to think that we might  dally and i dont want to be a liar so i wont be  matt well i certainly appreciate your honesty and well i would be lying if i didnt say i was  a little disappointed but at the same time the heart wants what the heart wants and ive enjoyed  our flirtation perhaps our paths arent meant to be quite so entwined such is the flow of fate my friend  sighs and he gives a little sigh of digesting heartbreak 
none	 a little bit but you know  theres a nod to him of understanding and acceptance and he looks up to you again with that  whipcrack of a gilmore smile and says i wish you luck the path of an uncertain heart is never an  easy one and should you ever need an ear to bend or a shoulder to cry on well you know where i  am and if im not there you know how to get hold of me  liam i reach out hand behind his head and i say you are a beautiful 
none	 arcane bastard and i  kiss him full on the lips  laura vax getting all the kisses  liam i pat him on the shoulder thank you  matt now youre just being a tease  laughter  matt he takes his cup which is empty and holds it up to the last drop it puddles out sighs  good night to you vaxildan  liam good night gil  matt walks out into the night as gilmore walks by you guys he looks over at keyleth and goes  get her some water  taliesin oh yes  
none	 marisha why does my mouth keep producing saliva  travis yeah ill get her water ill get her a little jug of the firewater itll wash out her mouth  ashley can i cast lesser restoration on her  matt you can  ashley all right lets do it  liam cure alcohol poisoning  ashley just to give her still a little bit of a buzz to just take the bad part out of it  matt a proper use of divine magic  taliesin you cant divine the sad out of alcohol i dont think that works  
none	 liam can pike follow us around all the time everywhere for the rest of our days  matt pike is the best wingman  marisha pike pike i missed you so much  ashley come here come here  marisha im sorry you guys im so sorry  matt keyleth as pike embraces you the warmth of her hug is also matched with the warmth of the  divine energy that briefly flows through your body and for a second you feel as if youre  weightless and the nausea is gone the drunkenness is still there and the buzz 
none	 is still  finding its way through your system but not as heavy as it was before you come a little more  conscious of yourself and when the warmth fades you feel much more in control of your current  state of your mind your wellbeing and the contents of your stomach  marisha holy shit what kind of shots did you give me grog  travis the weak stuff yeah i think they call it regret  sam peach schnapps  laura goldschlager  travis goldschlager jaeger lemon citron vodka  marisha groans  ashley oh man i 
none	 love this game  laura should we go home  sam lets go home weve left our mark here  travis does keyleth lose the benefits of the heroes feast since she retched it all over the ground  laura oh my gosh  marisha why would you ask that question  taliesin thats such a dick question to ask  marisha my body absorbed the process and the calories  matt it had been a few hours or probably about an hour since the initial feasting so shes had  enough to maintain the effect but the gentleman who 
none	 owns the establishment is probably not going  to be very happy in the morning when he has to clean up  marisha i made it outside  laura kick some dirt over her puke  liam its just twigs and berries anyway  matt you guys make your way back to greyskull keep as you approach the front gate of your  establishment you see cordell and shayne keeping their evening watch over the gate cordell shouts  down to the rest of you guys youve got guests waiting for you  laura and sam oh shit  laura 
none	 how long have they been here  matt he looks to shayne shayne looks to him counts in her head i think probably at least two hours  laura splutters how many times have we told you dont let guests in when were not here  matt they had your permission  laura oh jeez who is it  matt oh its a bunch of them  sam oh its my friends this is why i wanted to come home  laura oh jesus  marisha the party keeps going cordell cordell open another bottle  matt he looks over 
none	 at shayne who goes dont do that cordell  marisha god damn it cordell we pay you  sam its okay ignore her lets go in  matt the gate opens you guys come inside and you find as you enter the keep the smell of a  recently cooked meal is permeating the air of the keep you hear laughter and a little bit of music  in the distance  laura at least theyre having fun  matt and as you walk towards the eating chambers the central feasting area on the bottom floor of  your keep 
tavern	 there indeed you see your recently discovered friends  laura is that little is it a halfling teenager that was picking pockets at the bar is he here  matt he is yes  laura can i walk up to him  matt yes samson right now by the way is asleep on a table its way past his bedtime hes on the  edge there  laura i nudge him awake hey sticky fingers  matt hello miss  laura hey so i saw you at the bar getting things off of people pockets off of people  pockets 
none	  matt they told me they wouldnt miss them  laura no its totally fine i dont care you havent done that here have you  matt no  laura no  matt no not unless he tells me to and points to dr dranzel who at this point has been like  scanlan finally chuckles  sam lovely to see you  matt you can see now theres three bottles of wine theyve been drinking that are open and  about  sam did you bring those  matt no but they were provided and im not one to 
tavern	 not drink when its not provided  sam well thank you  marisha oh good cordell cordell im sorry you opened wine and i yelled at you im sorry  matt cordells at the front gate  marisha oh i figured cordell walked us in  matt no theyre up on the front gate keyleth is talking out to nothing  marisha thanks cordell thank you  matt the lesser restoration didnt have quite as strong an effect on reversing the alcohol but  shes not puking so thats good  marisha im still drunk  sam doctor thank you 
none	 for coming over and bringing the gang its so great to see you again  tonight  matt oh you guys as well you can see the rest of the people are watching zeds fallen asleep  eselmyrs in the back corner watching everyone  sam is that the singer  matt yeah shes the older mature elven woman whos keeping an eye kaylie is there sitting  next to dranzel and kent plucker has a lute hes musical note on well come sit  unless its too late in the night i have a conversation id like to have 
none	  sam oh please lay it on us anyone want to go to bed  marisha no  matt chuckles i like her  taliesin yes but lets do this anyway  sam all right laina bring around some meats wait we already ate  laura we already ate were fine were so full  sam all right laina go back to sleep  matt laughing she looks tired shes like whimpering more meats okay is it all right if  i go to bed  all yes  matt sleep well glad you made it home safe she wanders 
tavern	 back off bags under her eyes dr  dranzel waves you all in so that little proposition that we talked about at the bar  earlier today the old man who didnt need his fortune  marisha oh  matt allow me to elaborate a bit in a more private setting if you dont mind  liam more private than our house  matt this is the more private  liam ah cincin everybody cincin  sam is that lipstick on your face vax  liam maybe it is i dont know where it would have come from though this 
dung	 is a land of magic and  mystery who knows  matt as dranzel holds out his mug he goes now when we arrived to come play the winters crest  festival here in emon one of my contacts well say an old client of mine last year in emon right  around the same time mentioned a peculiar thing apparently a wealthy lord here vanished about a  year ago his estate was sold to a private collector apparently this collector keeps his  name off the books and he couldnt really find out any information about who he 
none	 was or what his  business is but he acquired the entire estate people were curious as to what his business was  as the previous individual was rather well known and the circumstances rather dubious in  disappearance but i dont know really how that all went together anyway this older collector  was fairly active at this estate until a few months ago the windows have darkened and stayed  as such no furniture touched the interior elements unpacked or moved just went away so im  thinking either this fellow has kicked the final bucket met his 
town	 end or is off on some extended  business trip leaving his acquisition and all of its contents ripe for the picking problem is we  cant get into the cloudtop district kent and kaylie have tried numerous times almost got  arrested and you can see kaylie gives a nod with her shoulders shrugging still got a few  things to learn apparently  laura did you try winking  matt its the first thing i threw out there dear he goes back so seeing as how you folks  have got some pull in the town i was 
none	 thinking you could either find a way to get us in quietly  carefully let us do our work give us some tips on the best way to stay out of sight or you could  go in grab a few things come back here with the spoils and well take our cut his eyes look  over to you i get the feeling that this kind of work is not unfamiliar  laura its certainly things weve done in the past  sam didnt we discuss this and assume that this is a house wed been in once before 
none	  laura are we talking about general kriegs house or are we talking about the guy that we first came  into his house in emon remember the diplomat  travis we dont know either way  sam do you know who used to reside there doctor  matt sighs the name escapes me  sam what about a position  matt you do recall the cloudtop district was not at your disposal when you first came here  sam so this is a new place  laura its probably general kriegs place  matt possibly  laura ragelooting  
dung	 marisha yeah we found the lair  travis down in the dungeon there was the demon  liam teleportation device  laura it could be a different house  taliesin this was a while ago  laura does it sound like general kriegs place did you get a description of the place  matt yes red brick building iron fence surrounding the outside  liam thats it  laura thats like every house though  matt actually no most of the houses there have various colors kriegs was built more utilitarian  and was very minimalistic in its interior decor 
none	 in fact most of it seemed unused from what you  saw other than the manservant that lived there the house for the most part the bedroom  everything that you searched seemed like it was barely touched  laura because he was a dragon  travis yeah he was a fucking dragon  laura was that his house that hes describing  matt it seems pretty damn close to the description that you recall  liam if we were to be interested its true that you are pointing us in the direction of this  place but we would 
none	 be doing all the work we would need a very high percentage  matt id previously discussed a 6040 split  liam i know thats what you said i said high  matt 7030  liam 8020 or im not doing shit you can send him in  sam hey this is my friend  matt sighs a tough bargain but 8020 it is  matt and liam spitting noises  matt all righty  laura we havent agreed to it  matt you just did  laura we agreed to give you a cut if we go in  
town	 matt fair enough  laura heres the thing if you havent noticed we have a keep an embassy were known around  town were council members we cant go stealing things from peoples houses  matt well thats unfortunate well have to find somebody else  travis well hold on he made a deal with you if he doesnt do it well find somebody that will hes  a man of his word and well back it up you dont have to do it  sam you know vex we have sort of told the sovereign that we are interested 
none	 keenly in the  security of this area and if this is an unsecured house we could just be going in to try to secure it  travis excellent point  matt see thinking of the people thats the scanlan shorthalt i know  travis and remember there were dangerous things in that house we can make sure that its safe  now protecting the you know  sam yes god forbid a child wanders in there  travis god forbid  liam were not talking about breaking into a living mans home krieg is gone krieg was a  
none	 dragon  laura and then it was obtained by somebody else who you dont know who it is  marisha oh are we talking about general krieg  laura he was so dreamy do you remember him  marisha he was so dreamy  matt krieg ive heard that name i think that may be the gentleman  marisha oh you know krieg  matt well i dont know him  taliesin perhaps we should at least take a look to see if there was something else down there that  was dangerous  travis she said fine i heard 
none	 her she said fine  sam lets do this tomorrow well set off to do this in the meantime we invite you to stay at  our keep drink of our wine eat of our food  marisha yeah more wine  sam please make yourselves at home  matt is this not the greatest bard to have lived  sam chuckles yes  travis we think so  sam thank you  matt scanlan you humble us all were happy to do so and thank you very much for your fine  hospitality  taliesin you humble us all 
dung	 by comparison  laura we have one room in addition to what we stay in would all of you be staying in the same  one or would you want to stay in the temple  sam we have a couple of rooms  liam we have a dungeon  sam our dragonborn room is available now and as well we have a dungeon  travis ill stay in the dungeon they can stay in my room  sam i have a rather large bed if kaylie would like to take that i could sleep on the floor  thats 
tavern	 fine  laura you invited them to stay because you want to bone kaylie  travis what are you really cockblocking right now  liam did you just say that out loud  travis are you cockblocking in the keep  matt as youre saying this kaylie is watching this with a smirk on her face well im not one  to turn down a soft bed for an evening  travis yeah cant wreck that game  laughter  matt dranzel glances over laughs good luck  taliesin we can also put some beds out in the workshop which 
tavern	 has now been vacated  sam grog carry some beds around  marisha how long are you guys staying  matt zed sits up the large bearded gentleman hes like im happy to sleep here this is fine  by me just give me a flat surface he goes over to one of the tables and  sam is that zed the drummer  matt yeah hes the drummer  sam okay  travis why dont you invite the little pickpocket to sleep with you so you can keep an eye on him  so he doesnt steal stuff where 
none	 are you going perv  laura where are you going perv  laughter  sam lets all turn in shall we  travis lets turn in  matt all right  laura im going to stay up and keep an eye on the doors when they go into their rooms and make sure  they actually stay actually no im going to go find jareth  matt jarett you mean  laura jarett  matt its been that week  all aw  taliesin i shove keyleth into her room  marisha slurred good night percy  taliesin good night 
tavern	  matt you guys all find your way to your rooms you arrange beds for those who need it for the  most part down in the dungeon area a couple of rooms are crowded with other folks except for  kaylie who is following you scanlan with a bottle of wine and two glasses  laura oh my  liam oh dear  laura shes going to rob you blind  matt as you all go to your various rooms kaylie pulls out the chair and the table at the far end  of your bedroom sets down and 
none	 begins to pour glasses of wine and sits across you guys have  drinks and begin various conversations about  flute music  laughter  matt shes that good of a flute player she asks you about your history and your travels and how  you met dr dranzel and everything  sam i tell her all the best parts and leave out the naughty bits  matt interesting tale  sam kingslayer  matt right right  sam leader of the rebellion  matt so youve said a number of times aye  she drinks a little bit more

town	 a quilter she did now growing up i heard tale and tale of your musical  feats as my mother took on a third job to support us through bad harvests just south of silvercut  being the only tiny female fair folk in such a rural town means being preyed upon so  i learned to use a blade quickly and to wield my charm just as viciously seems that runs in the  family aye  sam i oh i  laughter  matt i practiced i stole lied about my age and eventually paid my way into

none	 her will falters and the blade falls  limp it hits your chest and you feel the piercing of something pushing into your flesh but  no more than maybe half an inch as theres no real force behind the blade as the hand releases  her weapon it clatters to the ground as her momentum carries her arms around your shoulders  all oh  matt as she holds you there her tousled short pixie brown hair you can feel the wetness across  the back of your neck and you hear her voice trembling in your ear say

none	 into a house with bad things coming out of it and we dont  know what these bad things are what did we agree to percy percy what did we agree to  taliesin we  marisha percy tell me  taliesin we agreed to take a look inside this house and if there was anything valuable we would  liberate it  matt and while you guys do that well wait here and eagerly keep an eye out for kaylie and  sam yes please do and keep a good eye out for her  matt sure  sam

none	 faster they leave at the very least  marisha i dont even know what were doing  taliesin itll be fine well explain it on the way  matt grog leaves  travis who else is coming  sam im coming  laura trinket follows before i do  taliesin trinkets coming  marisha trinket is a bear  taliesin yes a wise bear  laura keyleth seriously i dont want to steal anything i want to find out why these they  cant hear me im whispering to her  taliesin i think were already on our way arent 
none	 we  laura were walking i want to find out why they want to get into the house thats all something  shadys going on  liam the last time we were there something looked at us through things on the wall right so  it knew where we were and we fled we have no idea what we left behind we left in a hurry  taliesin and the new owner has also left in a hurry  marisha okay lets go  laura were keeping things safe  travis no we should stay we shouldnt go to the 
none	 house yeah lets fucking go  marisha were keeping things safe vox machina woo lets go  matt all right  taliesin its tough being the good one  laura i dont like them at our keep  sam were taking the bear or leaving the bear  laura were fucking taking the fucking bear  sam all right lets go  laughter  sam just a simple question  laura thats my whole fighting fucking thing is i have a fucking bear thats the whole point of the  class that i took i keep the bear  liam 
none	 what kind of classes have you been going to night school  laura yeah classes you know writing creative writing  liam emon community college  laura yeah im learning things every day  liam everyone says words i dont know what all these words mean whats a douchebag  travis we can remember how to get back to that house right  matt yeah  taliesin just skate over that one  matt you guys make your way towards the cloudtop district youre allowed through the gates and you  find your way across the central residential area to 
none	 the far northeast side of the district this is  further away from the palace within viewing distance from alluras tower which still stands  over the entirety of the district like this looming monolith currently empty and cold as  shes over in whitestone for this investigation however you do come across the familiar site of  general kriegs homestead the one you infiltrated a little over a year ago it looks like its a  little dilapidated but strangely enough for a person whos purchased this estate there wasnt  much attempt to try and beautify it the 
dung	 ivy has overgrown the bottom of it there is still the  iron gate around it it is currently closed and there are no guards posted around it it looks  empty and vacant and dark in the windows its about noon  liam have a look around  laura yeah go around the back  matt okay you guys scoot around to the back side anything in particular youre looking for  laura any signs of life  liam anyone around watching  matt perception check for those who wish to look around  liam 23 for me  
dung	 laura one  travis five  taliesin 16  matt all right we have percy and vax glance over you take about five minutes or so paying  very close attention to any sort of possible movement or light within the building nothing it  is dark it is motionless the windows are closed its a dark interior and you cant really make any  details out of the inside from this point because it is so closed off some of the curtains have  actually been drawn shut but not all of them a few of the windows are 
town	 open  liam what about around the house outside the house  matt outside the house the grass the lawn that surrounds this  liam or surrounding buildings  matt surrounding buildings there a number of other homes as well but this area is the more  upper class upper crust aspect of emon a number of various manors and rather decadent buildings  each building has its own color scheme its own architecture each thing is trying to be distinct  and different in this microcosm of the societal space of emon where most of the gold passes  
none	 through they have their own worries about presentation which is interesting because in the  middle of all these very beautiful homes you have general kriegs home which is pretty basic red  brick utilitarian and sticks out like a sore thumb by comparison or doesnt stick out at all  by comparison because its so normallooking  travis i like it  laura can i ask you guys before we do anything maybe it would be best to tell the guards that  were investigating a disappearance weve heard things about the house and we need to check  
none	 inside  sam what guards  marisha i agree  laura its obviously shady if we go sneaking in but if we say were going in the house because  we worry for it then its okay  travis should we tell them when we go to the bathroom too  laura maybe grog  sam were above them in rank  travis yeah  marisha but the guards have the ability to call higher authority on us and we dont want people  taliesin are there any guards that we can see right now  matt glancing about there 
none	 are none in your immediate vicinity youre not that far from the  citrine garrison which is the centerpiece of the higher military folk and they do have their own  guard station about youre about a tenminute walk from the palace which has a number of guards  throughout and you do have some patrols that come through the city but in the middle of the day in  the cloudtop its not as pressing a place for guard presence so you havent seen any  immediately around you but im sure if you wait for the next 1520 
none	 minutes one will probably come  your way  laura i mean they probably have a key to general kriegs place we can just barge on in  sam well its owned by someone isnt it someone deserted it  laura did somebody buy it after him  sam yes its private property  laura oh  sam youre being very prudent  travis yeah well totally wait here while you go tell the guards that we want to go inspect  something  sam were better at this than them lets go do what we do right trinket  
none	 matt bear noises as he growls into your ear  laura no  sam how can you resist that  taliesin if we come across a guard id be happy to inform them of what were doing  marisha why dont we at least do a little bit of preplanning do we need like a warrant for  something like this  travis oh fuck that i walk up to the door and knock really loud  laura theres a gate around the outside  matt there is a gate  travis i thought we were around the back  
none	 matt you guys were around back theres the gate which is about the fence itself is about  seven feet tall with little metal impaler spikes on the top  travis ill hop over that  matt all right go ahead and make an acrobatics check  sam hop check  travis 15  matt okay okay you deftly avoid falling upon one and spearing your manhood thankfully as you  grab the edge grunts loftily heft yourself over the top of the gate landing within the other side  of the browning yard that hasnt been wellkept  travis 
none	 hmm you might want to tell the guard im walking on the yard let them know im going and  i go off towards the house  matt grog walks away from you guys towards the house brazenly in the middle of the midday sun  taliesin grog that rhymed well done  laura anybody want a peanut  marisha i stand next to vex irritated  liam and during that whole exchange ive been changing cloaks and putting on the red one great  matt okay  laura subtle so stealthy now  liam i dont need to be 
none	 subtle im just standing around you guys are arguing hes making a fool  of you im just changing my cloak i have 17 cloaks  sam do you bring around one of those like  marisha wardrobe racks  sam yeah rolling wardrobe racks  liam yeah its on wheels its on wheels its functional  travis it bobbles on the cobblestones  matt youre going shh follow me squeaking sound  laughter  liam they smoosh up to about the size of a cabbage its really all right  laura so you have a very wrinkly red cloak 
none	 on right now  liam you know what never mind i think what i think is that grog and pike should lead the way  stealth in pick all the locks and i think everything will go really well  travis thats a great idea  liam im going to hang back i think thats the way to go  matt grog youre already at the front door  travis brilliant boom boom boom  sam grog just knocked  matt you guys hear in the distance knocking as grogs fist is now hitting  taliesin walking to the front 
none	 gate  marisha you know i could skywrite that were here in the sky again  matt nobody answers the door  travis theres no answer at the door  ashley can i try picking the lock  matt do you have lockpicks  marisha shes going to literally try picking the lock yes  ashley do i have a lockpick  liam i take pike by the hand and go here you go chum and i slap down my set in her hand  matt vex appears seemingly out of nowhere and slaps his lockpicks  liam im vax 
none	  matt im sorry vax so pike ive gotten much better at that  marisha it happens to everybody  matt pike you want to try and pick the lock  ashley yeah  matt all right go ahead and roll a d20 and add your dexterity  sam im going to inspire her  matt okay go for it  sam with a limerick  liam theres no way this is not good  sam all right im going to inspire her there once was a gnome with a mace who had an adorable  face she never would 
none	 bed me but i hope she wont forget me cause oh how i do love the chase  all aw  matt that is a real easy d10 inspiration die for you pike  marisha thats a pantydropper as sam would say  matt so go ahead and roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier  ashley okay  matt which is what  ashley so in addition to the 20  matt yeah well whatd you roll  ashley i rolled a six  matt okay then whats your dexterity modifier  ashley one  matt thats a seven 
none	 now go ahead and roll a d10 and add that to it  ashley okay i rolled a nine  all oh  sam that helps  matt all right wow okay that puts you at a 15 which is actually directly the dc of the door  ashley wait 16 16  matt even better  liam everybody meet your new rogue  matt yes with the rattle of metal plate the untrained eye and a couple times you hear the  metal creaking beginning to bend as she having no previous experience really with lockpicks from  what 
dung	 you know youre afraid shes going to break your toolset however shes picked up a few  things while she was at sea with you know more of the swashbuckling brigades over the western  shores and much to your surprise she click opening sound the door opens and the dark  interior of the home is at your disposal  sam see this is our problem weve been approaching doors without pike we need pike  travis i reach down and highfive pike  liam she pushes massive statues she unlocks all doors  travis i stick my head 
none	 in the door and i go hello is anyone home  ashley i give his pick back to him and i say it was just luck vax  liam shut up baby i know it  travis i lean back and i go theres nobody answering from inside vex you might want to go tell  the guard no ones inside  laura asshole i feel like we have a blessing of sarenrae though to go inside  matt as you step into the home a little bit the first thing you notice is the smell immediate  pungent scent 
none	 of decay hits your nose the source is not in immediate visual range and you cant  really tell what type of decay it is but its a definitively terrible smell and one that  permeates the interior of the foyer foyer  travis it smells like roses inside  taliesin im coming in  matt all right you come in its an experience as you guys walk in it catches you off guard and  you stand the main foyer open before you the only light currently within the interior is the  bit of sunlight thats bouncing in 
none	 from the front open doors and a few of the windows in the  distance to your left is a dining room theres a big red carpet in the center of the room theres  tapestries put all actually the decor in here is much more garish than you recall when you were  last here it was very simple it was very minimalist and you got the impression that the  house for the most part was not being lived in outside of the servant you recall there was a  passageway across from the foyer that led to 
none	 a gallery and that which had the  taliesin the trap room the little portal in it  matt yep the false wall in the back  laura oh right behind the tapestry right  taliesin lets find the source of the smell  laura trinket is actually really good at sniffing things out so maybe he can lead us to the smell  ashley good boy  matt trinket comes sniffing up sniffing sounds go ahead and make a perception check for trinket  laura okay its too much its advantage because of his smell  matt true  
none	 travis wow those sucked both times  laura shut up shit they do 16  sam oh thats good  liam enough to open a door  matt okay so trinket sniffs through steps into the center of the foyer pushes past the carpet  into the middle of the dining room and looks up at the table and as soon as you look over trinket  growls for a moment and you see there on the center of the dining room table is a meal set up  drink food but is completely molded over to the point where 
none	 parts of it have bloated and spilled  off and liquid has the putrescence has spread across part of the surface  taliesin oof i throw the gas mask on  matt its been there for quite some time you dont know quite how long  sam free food grog  travis i know it smells pretty good in here  laura is there dust on the ground has it been that long  matt yeah you check down you put your finger across it and it is a little dusty its not been  an extremely long period of 
none	 time but there is a layer of dust  laura is there anything changing the dust is there any tracks in it or anything  matt currently from what you can see no  marisha have we all entered  matt youve all begun to walk into the foyer yes  taliesin lets search the upstairs first see if theres a body or otherwise  marisha oh god this isnt helping with the hangover  liam does the smell get more intense at the food  matt yes the smell gets more intense as you enter the dining room  
none	 sam oh so its the food  liam i almost cant smell you  marisha can i druidcraft the table and take like the decaying food and maybe i dont know grow  some flowers out of it try to make it look nice  taliesin compost it  marisha try and compost it yeah  matt sure you take a moment and concentrate and use your druidcraft the fungus begins to reform  and more mushroomlike spores begin to appear out of it and sprout from the current festering mass  whereas once was a nasty spore cloudbased fungus 
none	 youve now converted almost into a colored  mushroomtype presentation  laura dont eat it grog  travis what  matt itll probably lessen the stench over time but no immediate effect as the smell has been  hanging here stagnant for quite a while  marisha its like a big old terrarium now  travis so its a big old house can we like split up and get it over with  sam split the party  marisha split the party  taliesin weve all got earrings lets start checking rooms and well get to the room that we 
none	  know is iffy last  sam okay so wait were checking all the rooms that are probably okay  taliesin yes im going to start upstairs check the bedrooms  liam you mean the not okay part being the teleportation room  sam and taliesin yes  matt whats up pike  ashley can i cast spirit guardians to be around us  matt you can what is the duration on that one  ashley ten minutes  matt yeah you can do that  laura nice  matt so as you guys are walking in pike clasps her 
none	 holy symbol and closes her eyes for a second  and you begin to see these almost glowing orbs like these ghostly entities that begin to swirl  and follow around you similar in the spirit stuff of pikes form when she was alongside you guys in  whitestone whos heading upstairs  sam ill go upstairs with percy  taliesin sure  travis anybody else  laura sure ill go upstairs too  marisha is there a downstairs like a cellar  matt the downstairs would be the path that you found last time  liam and thats it 
none	  matt you didnt inspect the rest of the house at that point  laura theres lots of downstairs rooms  taliesin we should remind everyone you are immune to poison you are immune to cursed youve got a  bonus on wisdom saving throws and plus 1d10 temporary hitpoints  marisha thats from the heroes feast  sam poison charm what was it  taliesin curse  marisha let me remember them all  travis all right well you guys go upstairs and well clear out this floor before we go anywhere  else and well wait for you 
none	 to come back down  marisha ill stay on the middle floor ill be team middle floor  matt okay as vex scanlan and percy head towards the stairway they step across the red  carpet in the center of the foyer i need all three of you to make a dexterity saving throw  laura oh i didnt say perception shit balls  sam dexterity huh  matt correct  laura natural 20  matt nice  taliesin 24  sam 12  matt laughs okay as you all step across theres a sudden smell of youve smelled it 
none	  before its the fresh strike of a lightning bolt or something that has burned in the atmosphere  you look over at percy and both of you feel this slight bit of tension and energy in the room and  you dodge out of the way at which point suddenly there is a burst of force energy from  the center of the room that surrounds scanlan blasting him in the process and you feel like  youre lifted off your feet but instead of being thrown upwards you slam into what feels like a  roof thats far 
none	 too low for the one youve seen you go ahead and take 16 points of force damage  and you land impact on the ground prone you look up around you and there is a cage of  arcane force energy right now that is holding you in place in a ten by ten foot area  crackling  liam they didnt make it out of the room right this is in the room that were all in  matt this is in the foyer you guys just now went all right were doing this go  impact its not 
none	 even two steps into your plan  marisha so were all still there we can see him  matt yeah you all see scanlan currently now trapped in this force cage  taliesin full on ghostbustering dont mime dont mime  sam well  marisha hang on hang on lets just leave him for a minute lets just leave him can we leave  him i can fix this i could fix it whispers but why dont we leave him  matt scanlan roll another dexterity check  sam oh shit its closing on me isnt it natural 20  
none	 matt okay you can see the cage itself its unstable energy occasionally arcs across like a  tesla coil and you manage to dodge out of the way and you can see now this cage not  just holds you in place but it also perpetually tries to damage those who are captured  marisha oh i feel a little bad ill let him out dispel magic  sam oh youve got that  marisha i did today  matt as keyleth waves her hand now the entire force cage vanishes into the air  sam did you guys see 
none	 that i was like in an aquarium  marisha it was kind of fun to watch im not going to lie  travis yeah you were like a dick in a box  sam more of a globe but yeah no that works  laughter  ashley oh wow  liam wow  sam singing step one lets go  taliesin gently checking for traps as we go up the stairs  sam thank you keyleth i take it back about your breath  matt i will say for the purposes of this everyone roll an investigation check  sam 
none	 everyone whos going upstairs  matt everyone roll an investigation check this is investigation  taliesin natural 20  sam 28  laura laughs 14  matt okay the three of you going upstairs you find no further traps you go through the rooms on  the top floor you find that where previously most of them were empty a lot of them have been  furnished now but most of the furnishings have been untouched like the house was being set up to  be almost like a summer home or a side home but no signs of life 
none	 everything seems to have the  same layer of dust you found on the floor in the foyer there is no real wealth being kept here  cause i know thats probably what youre looking for it looks like whoever had intended to this  collector hadnt quite gotten to the point of wanting to move any of their fortune their  masses into the upstairs area  laura all right  matt but it has been largely untouched for a number of months  sam so we go down  matt now what did you roll  marisha i 
none	 rolled 14  liam oh 11  matt grog  travis oh 11  matt pike  ashley 13  matt okay you guys take a little while to pore through the kitchen you find a basement you open  the latch and go down and look throughout and it smells mildewed down there but from general  dampness almost like recent rainy weather soaked into the ground soil there and was left to mildew  a bit you dont find any other signs of life looking about all the rooms you find the music  room theres the main 
none	 living den area mostly its almost like a showroom like everything was  set up but then never had the chance to actually host anyone or someone to actually live there and  enjoy it  marisha are there any further signs like the feast of people leaving in a hurry that seems like  someone was here and left really fast a suitcase or  matt from what you can tell the meal that was prepared the pots and pans and stuff that were  used to cook it are currently in a small basin that carries a little 
none	 bit of still water thats  been slowly evaporating over time with bits of dried food crusted around the sides the meal  itself appears to have been abandoned not in haste theres no signs of a struggle the fork is  still resting partially in the now mushroom funguscovered pile even getting near it youre  still like disgusted grunt but theres no previous sign of a struggle  ashley how big was the feast  matt it looked like it was just made for one person  taliesin interesting  travis are there any like sculptures or pieces 
none	 of art downstairs or desks  matt actually there are a number of rather garish tapestries around a number of them are of  different animals running and hunting and chasing not in a very beautiful way but the kind that  youd you know find at an airport  travis like the denver airport  matt you know like kinkade burst of light  taliesin wow you paint a picture there  matt yeah theyre all thematic and similar and none of them seem to have any other theme other  than whoever ordered them seems to like animals 
none	  taliesin no historical acts no mythology nothing like that  matt no not in this current setup  marisha can i detect magic on any of them  matt okay you scoot through and using do you have detect magic memorized  marisha no i wanted to arcane it  matt then make an arcana check to inspect and see if you see any signs of  marisha im not good at it  liam still mildly hungover  marisha yeah still really hungover 14  matt 14 going from place to place nothing seems to jump out at 
none	 you as enchanted or any sort of  arcane nature the only room you havent inspected yet is the hallway across from the foyer the one  that led into the original gallery room and then into the hidden  travis the funhouse  sam lets all go  travis should we check the fucking carpet  marisha i say yeah  laura yeah teleportation circle remember there were a shitton of traps before we got to it  matt whats up pike  ashley can i do a religion check to see if theres any vecna stuff here  
none	 laura yeah smart move  matt yeah make a religion check  ashley 20  matt okay looking about and keeping this in mind you dont see any sort of religious  iconography any of the artwork any of the small knickknacks that are throughout the den nothing  here speaks of any sort of religious connotation or at least whoever has decorated this place did  so purely out of visual aesthetic choice so yeah nothing catches your attention in this room  ashley okay  matt all right  sam lets go whos going first pike  ashley 
none	 sure  liam pike then grog  matt all right pike grog whats the rest of the marching order here  laura trinket then me  taliesin then me  matt then percy  travis does pike get a cloak  marisha i guess me  sam then vaxs wardrobe rack then me  liam no its got to go behind i have to pull it behind  matt all right so  ashley do i get that invisibility cloak again  liam no  laughter  matt all right you guys step through its a short hallway and it 
none	 leads you into a 20x80 long  room and here you do see a number of tapestries and there are the ones that were left previously  actually this room has not really been touched much since you came in when krieg currently lived  here you can see these tapestries are much older these ones depict more mythological moments one  of them shows the elemental creation of existence its almost like a biblicaltype very artistic  representation of the creation of the different planes youve seen it done before  marisha is that the same one that was 
none	 here last time  matt yeah yeah same one there are a number of small cylindrical platforms that rise up in the  center of this room you see on the first sets a series of bronze busts of a particular man wearing  a cloth wrap a headpiece his features are still nondescript theres a lot of detail in the  clothing in the neck wrap and the head wrap but when it comes to the actual features of the face  its very simple and plain  liam not enough to recognize anything  laura kind of like 
town	 a god of secrets  matt no im actually going to ask you guys to roll a history check  sam 22  taliesin 26  laura what is this history  marisha 20  laura 21  matt all righty so glancing at this the three of you you dont recognize the face at all and  the best that you can recall is there have been tales in a faroff continent called marquet which  is a largely desert landscape the few bastions of civilization that exist in this  desert there is one central town referred to 
none	 as ankharel youve never been there youve heard  of it and its this little oasis in this center of this vast desert  laura oh oh wait  marisha yeah  laura thats where riskel was going to go  matt its also where jarett is from  sam jaretts a mole kill him  matt and youve heard that the city has been lorded over and run in a very benevolent way by an  individual referred to as jmon sa ord the city has existed for about 400 years and since its  existence has been run 
none	 by jmon sa ord people dont know if hes human what he is but hes  apparently lived that long  laura how long i didnt hear because i was writing  matt 400 years  matt but the most that youve heard about jmon is human but his features are hard to make out  like even to look into his face still seems like you cant focus  liam that doesnt sound good  matt thats as much as you can assert and those thoughts come to you three and you see this bust  these series of 
none	 busts that seem to depict this individual and to the best of your knowledge  thats probably an artists depiction of jmon sa ord which youve never seen in taldorei or  anything of this type of construct  laura but we know that thats where riskel wanted to go as well i want to pull out the symbol of  vecna that i took off of riskel and  matt okay  marisha i feel like we mightve i feel like thats not also the first time weve heard of  ankharel  laura well jaretts from there  
none	 marisha i feel like even before then like a long time ago  liam can i check for traps while theyre talking  matt sure make a perception check  marisha marquet is the continent correct  matt correct yes  marisha and ankharel is a city within the continent  liam 20  marisha its like a desert continent the whole continent is like desert  matt desert and mountains  marisha so its like australia  matt laughs looking about there are no traps in this room it looks to be pretty clean pretty  clear also you 
none	 see on the pillars there are a few other things there is a golden tea set made of  pure gold on one of the pillars there is a mostly and very oldlooking set not complete  set of ivorycarved dominoes theres a human skull humanoid skull doesnt quite look human  it looks elongated and the teeth are sharpened looks almost elvish but one eye  socket has an uncut rough emerald embedded in the socket  marisha which one  matt the right socket  sam thats straightup goonies  this place has been pilfered before and no 
none	 one took that  travis i go over to the dominoes  taliesin im going to examine the skull  marisha im going to help percy examine the skull  matt okay are you just taking a look at it  taliesin im taking a look at it im checking to see if its attached to the its sitting on a  column at the moment  matt its sitting on one of the columns yeah its part of the collection  taliesin im seeing if its attached at all and very gently turning it if i dont see any 
none	  matt as you reach out take it and its weight and you lift it off the cylindrical pillar  taliesin i was just going to turn it i wasnt quite going to lift it yet  matt as you turn it it turns freely  taliesin all right i give it a little lift  matt you lift it up off of the pillar and on that as you do that nothing happens it is in your  hands however  sam everyone dies  matt yeah its heavier than you expected it would be and  taliesin oh 
none	 god its going to talk to me isnt it  matt theres a part of you that like a slight cold chill runs down your spine  taliesin a recognizable cold chill or a brandnew cold chill  matt no just like every person has that little part in the back of their head that says this  probably isnt a good idea but whatever  laughter  taliesin i hate you so much  matt so youre holding it in your hand what do you want to do  liam youre like a magnet for evil  taliesin im 
none	 a little evil magnet i know im checking is the emerald set into the socket or is  it removable  matt its set in the socket actually and the emerald go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin all right natural 20  matt all right glancing into the socket you can see the emerald is actually set within the socket  it is set with meticulously jewelcrafted gold inlay that actually almost looks like a very  deepset filigree that binds it within the socket itself like its very deliberately placed the  craftsmanship of the very 
none	 very fine gold filigree and yet the uncut nature of the emerald  seems strange and as you inspect the emerald itself it seems almost like while the gem itself  is stationary there is the eversofaint image of movement within the gem almost like a freshly  disturbed pond like a slight ripple of the surface of water there is just eversoslowly  shifting within the gem  taliesin i think ive found something evil  laura maybe you should not be touching it  marisha yeah can i do a nature check to see if i can recognize 
none	 what kind of skull it might be  matt sure  marisha 17  matt the skull does not come from any beast that you are familiar with youve not encountered a  creature of this physiology and it definitely doesnt come from the realm of nature from your  understanding  liam pike dont you think you should have a look at it  ashley yeah can i give it a what do you see inside the gem  taliesin its like a ripple almost like a pond thats just gently disturbed oh i have a thought  marisha 
none	 what  taliesin this is precisely the sort of awful thing that i would design if i wanted a way to  look into a hallway im going to place it back on the column facing the wall  matt okay  sam pike do you want to look at it further  ashley yeah can i give it a look i want to look at the tea set too  laura i know i want to go look at the tea set  liam lets look at the evil skull first  ashley can i do a check  
none	 matt okay so what are you trying to check about the skull  ashley i dont know like if its i dont know i dont know what to check  travis if its evil  laura is that like an arcana check or  matt well it depends on what nature youre trying to ascertain of the skull are you trying  to figure  ashley yeah well i want to check if its evil but i dont know it seems like it is  liam i mean weve been talking about  matt there are spells called detect good 
none	 and evil  liam  some fucknut with one eye i feel like  sam oh its vecna  marisha its the left eye he said its in its right eye  laura still then its left eye is empty  ashley i have it i have it i have it i have it let me do that  matt you have it memorized  ashley yep its right in here  matt okay all right so as per the spell let me get the rules up here real fast because the  question comes up often if you want 
none	 this app on your phone its called fight club 5 on the  itunes store for free you have to do some updates and uploading of your own you can find  information on the web on how to do it but that way you know and stop tweeting me i dont mind  its fine all right so detect good and evil evil and good all right so you take a moment  and you focus by the way this is a concentration spell doing this will get rid of  your spirit guardians  ashley okay i think 
none	 thats okay i think thats fine  matt okay so as the orbs that have been rotating around for the past you know its been about ten  minutes they probably would have faded anyway gently dissipate you focus your intent on the  skull and this object while it is not a desecrated object per se there is an essence  inside that does not strike you as moral there is something about its very nature that does give you  pause you are unable to ascertain the nature given the fact that you would have to take some 
none	  time with it to really do so but you get the feeling that there is some power within it but  probably not the kind that is very fortuitous for someone of your persuasion  ashley okay i think its bad  travis you think its bad  ashley lets have it face the wall i dont want it looking at us  laura can i go take the top off the tea set and look inside  matt yeah you go ahead and take the top off the tea set and look inside it is empty it is 
none	  polished and the light that comes in as you open the top just refracts the image from the outside  of the tea set and its just beautiful craftsmanship the actual gold itself is very  smooth on most of the tea kettle and all the cups themselves all have very very intricate scrolling  on them that have been handcarved in its a beautiful set this is like a royal gift this is  something that you know people who trade across political boundaries use to you know send  goodwill to the other side this is probably 
town	 worth quite a bit  laura is there any stamping on it to like show who its from or anything like that  matt you look on the bottom and it has the initials lm  laura lm lm lm  travis love macna  matt the street cousin of vecna  taliesin i would recommend that if we are going to purloin things we should do it on the way  out rather than the way in  laura oh yeah definitely  travis all right are the dominoes just like on a table  matt yeah some of 
none	 them are set on the side theres a stack and then a few of them are set  up its literally placed in like a nice presentational like qvc style turn it and look at  all the cool dominoes type  travis i grab the table and i shake it  matt okay all the dominoes scattering sound scatter and fall off the sides clatter sounds  and clinking on the ground some of the ivory chips a little bit on some of the corners  ashley grog  matt nothing bad seems to happen  travis i think 
none	 its evil i reach down i pick up one of the ivory die  matt it stands there cold against the very well you taste it as your tongue touches the  ivory of the domino  it tastes somewhat salty  travis i believe it tastes like a domino  laura okay can we go look at the teleportation thingy now  sam and taliesin lets go down  matt all right you guys make your way to the far back wall of the room and there is that same  tapestry that you saw before it depicts a 
none	 large storm cloud that is roaring over the cliffs  sam im just going to peek behind the tapestry  liam theres a door behind there  matt you open up the tapestry and its just a flat stone wall  sam okay nothing there  travis are you sure  sam i lick the wall  matt okay as you lick the wall your face wind sound passes through the wall  laughter  laura isnt that the same doorway we found before  marisha yeah weve already done this once you guys lets not be crazy  sam 
none	 i forgot about that whered my face go  taliesin it was just like this last time except there was brunch thats all i remember  matt as your head passes through you look about and you can see stairs that descend for about 40  feet into darkness  liam all right i grab scanlan by the scruff and pull him back and then i start in and i grab my  sister by the ear behind me and start pulling her down  marisha so wait wait theres the theres still the tapestry in front of it  
none	 matt yeah theres a tapestry in front of it yeah  marisha can i take the tapestry off the wall i want to like take it and put it over my shoulders  and jump a little  sam like make it a parachute  marisha yeah see if  laura is it flying  matt okay as you take the tapestry and you put it around you grab on the ends of it and you jump  in the air it jumps with you and lands with you its a very heavy tapestry most tapestries the  amount of 
none	 craftsmanship that goes into it the material this one in particular it falls very  very heavily against the wall and doesnt really gather any air or  taliesin in her defense the last time she tried this it did fly away its not a flying  tapestry  marisha yeah i just thought id try  laura maybe just put it over top of that skull and keep it hidden for now  marisha okay i take the tapestry and i put it over the skull  matt okay as you throw the tapestry on top of the skull 
none	  marisha oh boy  matt nothing happens  taliesin such an asshole  matt its just fun to mess with you guys all right so you guys progress down the stairway  liam perception check perception check perception check  laura oh god really  liam 20 for me  travis 19  laura one  matt delight glancing in the next room and this is a small chamber you guys have seen before its  about 30 feet across on the far end there is a small circular stone platform about six inches  thick that has deep 
none	 inset runes carved in a circular pattern across it its less polished  than the ones youve seen at the lyceum in emon but it is definitively the last teleportation  circle you took to the cavern that housed general krieg where you had your encounter  liam and the last time we were here i found a safe path through do i remember it  matt correct you actually distinctly recall the pattern to the best of your ability  liam up up down down left right left right  matt now i want you to go ahead and 
none	 make a wisdom check  marisha you have advantage no wait thats saving throws never mind  laura use luck  liam i could use luck yeah 20  matt 20 yeah you recall the exact pattern through leading the way stepping from stone to  stone to stone you guys following his pattern you manage to make your way all of you including  trinket who has to bear grunts  marisha he remembers  matt guide you through you make your way all the way across the room to the teleportation circle  and this is the end 
none	 of this portion of the hallway what do you wish to do  sam do we step onto it how does it work  laura i dont remember  travis i think we just run ahead  laura wait does it look like theres been anybody in here since we left  matt go ahead and make a survival check  sam survival  liam jeepers  laura what in the popping sound thats my third one of the night  travis can i do that one too i can survival stuff pretty well  marisha can i assist grog 
dung	 in finding if our footsteps were the last ones out  matt true i was giving this more as a means of giving the trained tracker a better look into  this ill give you a simple perception check as youre not quite sure  travis thatll be way worse  liam worse than a natural one  matt but with keyleths help that will give you advantage  travis 11  matt its hard to tell this room itself is pretty dark the little sconces that hold this low  flicker of eternal arcane light theyre just gently flickering 
none	 on the sides of the walls in  the low light its hard to make out any details of the ground and for the most part the stonework  here seems unchanged  laura we suck  taliesin are we going onto the teleportation pad then  liam but i think we assume were walking into trouble  sam trouble is our middles names  marisha well lets think of what happened last time we were here  sam there was a dragon there was some loot  travis there was a bunch of gold  marisha there was a 
none	 bunch of gold and there were three eyes in a wall  laura and marisha saying they were coming for us  sam did we crack one of them  marisha we did crack one of them one cracked  laura they all cracked  marisha but wait werent the  sam maybe theyve reformed  matt there were four orbs and then one eye showed up in one of the orbs and then all four cracked  travis cant we send like a probe cant you make a little person a little fake little person  sam i can 
none	 make a fake person to push something or lift something but he wont be able to  travis he cant take a magic ride  marisha these arent the same gems that were holding uriels family those were different  laura no these were dragoneye things  liam these were palantirs hanging in a wall where another dragon somewhere peeked through and was  pissed off  laura lets do it lets go through pow  matt okay as each one of you step on individually onto the platform theres a brief  moment of the wind beneath your stomach 
dung	 being lifted and you feel those butterflies hit as  suddenly your imagery shifts and immediately you find yourself standing on a similar platform  elsewhere as you step off as you feel force pushing you forward as each individual starts  appearing behind in rapid succession immediately you notice the air change to extremely cold  marisha thats right it was in the mountain cave  matt looking around you can see there directly near you there are a few stalagmites with a  little layer of snow and ice on it and there are a couple patches of 
none	 ice that have solidified on  parts of the floor across the way you can see immediately a large portion of the entire tunnel  has collapsed theres just piles of just rocks and stones that have filled about 60 to 65 of  what was previously general krieg or as you found the name to be bonescythe brimscythe sorry  brimscythes chambers all the rocks have crumbled onto where the dragon hoard that you were  ragelooting before currently resided now just held beneath the boulders and rocks  sam get rid of those rocks  marisha i might 
dung	 be able to  matt there are pockets of the cave that are walkable to the left it ends to where the  boulders and rubble had fallen to the right it continues outward towards the outside of the  mountain where you guys recall stepping to the edge of the precipice and you notice that this  mountain was veryvery high up in the mountain range somewhere in the world where there was just  ice and snowcapped mountains as far as you could see into this valley of high crags  marisha well if i recall it wasnt 
none	 too far from stillben right because keyleth recognized it as  her home mountains like two hours  matt you recognize it as the cliffkeep which is the large mountain range to the north of taldorei  which contains kraghammer the very south base contains gatshadow and its where the umbra hills  leads up into you dont know where in that range its a huge mountain range but its in that range  liam is there any sign of the pile of gold that grog started ragelooting  matt make a perception check sings make a perception check  
dung	 sam everybody  matt everybody who wants to look around  liam 23  travis 18 oh mine is oh 18  laura 17  sam 20  matt percy keyleth  taliesin nine  marisha natural 20  matt all right the combined vision of you three glancing about you see there are scattered bits  of gold and silver occasionally visible around the floor but theyre all independent and probably  thrown about during the scuffle or the collapse you guys notice there are bits of dragon bone  trapped beneath the rocks exposed elements of these bones 
none	 appear to be scraped and already  sundered by somebody harvesting the remains the longdecayed remains of brimscythe you also  notice there are two tunnels to the north and south side of this chamber across from where you  guys entered theyre smooth about ten feet in diameter and both carve into the heart of the rock  marisha can i do a nature check  travis umber hulks  marisha yeah dont those fuckers do that type of shit 20 total  matt 20 okay the way these tunnels are created and youve seen umber hulks and things 
none	 of that  nature carved through there is a rough aspect to that digging and burrowing process where the earth  itself has an uneven you know a general purposed direction but is in itself a very haphazard just  grab and tear whats in your way type form of burrowing these are round and smooth  marisha no scratch marks claw marks almost seems mechanical type of magical  taliesin ill assist in that perception check  matt okay you guys can do that  liam and none of us remember them from our past visit  matt no 
none	 in fact one of them is burrowing through the actual rubble on the north side by where the  hoard was buried  laura gasps no  taliesin all right taking a look thats  marisha how can you tell  taliesin because its the flat 13  matt okay as you step up and look about the rubble the best you can make out is parts of the  rock and you know the rock here has been set since the collapse of this side of the tunnel  there are a series of scratch marks across the set 
none	 stones and rocks here meaning that something  large has rummaged through the rubble here something with bladed or clawed appendages has  been here and has very viciously or hurriedly attempted to find its way through the rubble you  also notice there is to the immediate left and northwestern side of this cavern a small alcove  that just disappears into the wall out of sight  marisha that wasnt there before or was that one there before  matt no that was there before yeah  laura does it seem like this could have been made by 
none	 a dragon these scratch marks  matt you and dragons  laura favored enemy  matt yeah as your favored enemy make a  laura im scared of all of my d20s right now  marisha roll good  matt make a nature check  laura a nature check  matt with advantage because its a dragon dragons are magical entities this would be more  arcana  laura plus two on dragon checks arcana  matt theyre magical entities ill give you eitheror what did you get  laura i rolled a 16 but i get plus two on 
none	 any investigation for dragon info stuff  matt okay these marks across could very easily have come from a dragon a very large one you  also notice that there are elements of the rocks amongst this rubble that there appears to be soot  and singe marks across it  laura are dragons known for digging or are there certain types of dragons that are known for  digging  matt there are a couple that can burrow and dig through rock and stone in particular the blue  dragon the one that you guys defeated in here can 
none	 burrow naturally as can the white dragons  theyre natural burrowers though not the most intelligent of the chromatic dragons you also  know that some of the metallic dragons also like the brass dragon is a burrower  marisha would they be capable of making the smooth tunnels  matt not that smooth those come from something else you inspecting the alcove  taliesin yeah  matt as you look inside the alcove immediately you see in the shadow and what little bit of light  is coming from the outside part of the tunnel and it is pretty
