gentleman of who they had left zadash to earn money and praise with found themselves /none/ in the  outskirts of hupperdook where three members of their team were captured in the middle of the  night by a group of traveling slavers  laura which members  travis pay attention  marisha oh no jester has amnesia you guys  matt oh the amnesia arc youve got to have one at every point in the party we lost one we gain  one i know these three members yasha jester and fjord all captured by the iron shepherds  this group of slavers and dragged north to shadycreek run outside of the laws of the /none/ empire  the rest of the members finding new allies in keg the dwarven fighter nila the firbolg druid  and a brief reappearance of the fantastic human cleric shak√§ste these friends together managed  to storm the gifted stronghold of the sour nest attack and destroy one by one this team of  slavers leaving the iron shepherds down to their last few in the subterranean basement where these  cages contained their friends chained and held in darkness there the battle with lorenzo  revealing his final form after stalking them invisibly from the air for their entire /none/ journey  through that fortress revealed himself to be an oni a terrible creature of nightmare and entirely  unnatural strength and capability however through some ingenuity fast thinking and some  incredible luck lorenzo found himself unable to escape the members of your team knocked  unconscious brought back from the brink and a final blow was dealt by caleb as his arcane  cinders burned away the final remnants of lorenzos demonic form there as you began to  inspect the interior of the subterranean chamber you discovered in one set of these prison cells to  the /none/ left there lie chained jester and fjord in the other an unconscious yasha with that you  made your way through the bars unlocking the mechanisms that held them at bay and have now  come back face to face with your taken friends with one new friend and one missing and thats  where we come in jester you and fjord both in the chamber after enduring the sounds of other  captors being punished being tortured and a nearby friend enduring it silently just to  frustrate them youve been trying desperately to contemplate ways of escape to /none/ try and find a way  to relieve yourself of your bindings to no avail then suddenly theres the sound of battle  weapons scraping on stone and metal and flesh screams familiar voices flashes of light the  air rushing warm and cold with the nearby blasting of arcane energies divine forces and powers  brought in to sustain and snuff life and then silence you hear the voices come close and as  you barely manage to move over and glance over your shoulder you watch as the bars swing open to  the chamber where youre held /town/ and the tiny form of nott the brave rushes over and embraces you saying  sam case closed  laura muffled speech  sam oh yes okay ill take whatever is on her mouth off  matt you pull off what is essentially a thick leather gag that has been keeping her from  speaking  laura gasps oh  sam hello  laura how did you guys find us  sam well we followed the clues we traced the evidence we thought about it logically and also  this girl who was walking down the street told us where /none/ to go  laura really  sam yeah  laura i didnt even get to tell anyone i tried to i tried to cast sending but my hands are bound  sam oh let me untie you ill cut out cut off her hands  matt theyre bound by chained manacles but well say given the fact that there is no immediate  pressure of time you take your time with the bindings using your lock picks and manage to  free her of the manacles  laura thank you fjord is also tied up though really bad  sam /none/ how are you doing oh sorry  laura oh my muscles would be really sore this is really hard for me somebody else should help  him out  sam are you sure hes not just  laura seriously though this is really painful

the other chamber and you  do see faced away and lying within the other chamber is yasha you manage to eventually /none/ get it  open and inside she is lying there motionless  marisha can i check her to see if shes still breathing  matt mmhmm its really relatively easy to check shes breathing she looks pretty  brutalized there are gashes and tear marks in the flesh where hooks were pulled through there are  streaks of dried blood on her but shes not unconscious within an inch of her life shes a  hardy woman and shes endured a lot and then some and she lies here unconscious before you  still bound in manacles  liam seeing /none/ beau go in ahead of me still sitting on the table i mutter a word and cast knock and  the manacles fall away  marisha deuces  taliesin hmm  marisha have any

morning  liam is it ooh  matt you guys have been doing all this through the night  travis are we taking a long rest  liam yeah sleep until the afternoon  travis before i turn in can i sit with mollys sword  matt yeah  /none/ travis staring at it thank you you were very kind to me i hope to do right by you and make it  up to you one day and ill try to concentrate on the sword  matt okay as you focus and attune to the weapon you feel the essence of the blade that you had  previously bound yourself to begin to slip faint interior rumbling of your ribcage begins to feel  like a heavy bass that is quaking on the inside of your torso its uncomfortable at first and then  you realize its this burrowing /dung/ for lack of a better term appetite with the previous weapon now  gone and that void that hunger focusing in youre looking at the blade and you blink and as  your eyes open that shadowed depths are around you once more you look around for an instant and  all you see is the deep dark recesses of some endless ocean you look down at the blade in your  grasp the summers dance blade and then blink once more and youre back in the chamber and its  gone from your hand  sam the blades gone /none/  matt yeah  laura dude you just swallowed that thing whole like totally  matt you guys watched as he focused on it over time the blade seemed to fade away it looks like  the exterior begins to turn to ash and crumble but then nothing hits the ground below it then  its gone  liam we all saw this  matt all those who were paying attention and hadnt gone to sleep yet  marisha where does all this stuff inside of you go you have so much extra storage space in you  travis yeah /none/ im kind of like this bag of holding huh  marisha yeah  travis yeah i dont know i want to keep molly with us though with me  marisha i know what you mean  matt with that awkward silence you see keg staring straight out the guilt on the face of the  mention of molly once more im going to have to im just going to leave you guys to rest im  going to take some me time then backs out of the dome and one quick glance at beau as she exits  marisha i /none/ poke my head out and i go you owe me a night and i go back in i pop back in and i go  ill be back in like an hour and 20 minutes  travis why dont you make it two hours  marisha if its two hours dont come looking for me if its two and a half then

to get out my sketchbook and im going to leave the little bubble for a little bit  and wander out and i see beau and keg i wander a little further away and i sit down with my sketchbook  marisha you just see blankets its like when the sims  liam you just see a windmill of legs  laura woohoo im going to try to think of what to draw for the last few days to tell the traveler  about but i dont really know what to draw instead i just write well why didnt /none/ you come  and then i close the book i go back inside after a little bit  matt okay you all finish a very necessary long nights rest coming to consciousness as the dome  vanishes exposing the center of the base floor walkway where caleb had set up both the  protections of his spells and the dome in the first place beau has not returned  travis atta girl  matt you all wake up the front door which is right across from where you are is partially ajar  partway open  liam i go outside /none/ and get some fresh air and see what i see  matt okay make a perception check  liam 17  matt you walk outside its early afternoon now its chilly snowfall has set in now and there  is a faint snowfall over the entire grounds of the interior of this courtyard where the trees have  been cleared for the construction of the sour nest is just white you see it gathering up on  the tops of the walls on the outside its almost beautiful if not for the connotation of where you  are all around /none/ you on the outskirts of the wall you can see where the white is dusting over the  purple and grays of the savalierwood that surrounds you you do notice across the way the  open gates on the southern side of the wall that enters into the courtyard are also partially ajar  you see faint footsteps leading from the gate to where you are  liam are they deep heavy dwarf footprints  matt they are and theyre heading away from you  liam i rub my thumb along the lucky rock in my pocket and smile at /none/ the snow and think about  playing in it when i was younger and go inside to wake up anyone whos still sleeping  matt okay beau at one point you did wake up this morning halfheartedly as some people arent  as stealthy in their exits as others  liam cling clang clung clung  matt open one eye and glance over and the door closes  marisha i chuckle and roll over and go back to sleep smile as i dig into my pillow  matt all right you all come to consciousness as caleb wakes you on /none/ the outskirts of the dome by  where nott was sleeping there is a tiny little piece of paper  sam oh its a note for me its really badly written its like frankenstein wrote a letter  liam name is spelled wrong too  laura sory  sam should i read it to you guys it says nott sorry for going before you woke up bad at  goodbyes never really had friends before yuto was my only friend but now you and i are friends  this medalon medalion medallon this thing was from yuto it will protect /none/ you thank  you for helping me keg ps if anyone hurts you i will kill them kill is spelled wrong  matt there is underneath the paper where you pulled it away you saw it was a medallion that  was hanging from the bottom of her warhammer it has a symbol of a star or a sun of multiple points  sticking out on all sides  sam ill take it and put it around my neck  matt all right  sam i am now invincible  travis oh shit medallion of cigar smoke medallion of stogies /none/  marisha medallion of five oclock shadow  matt have to have one character in every campaign that grows facial hair for no reason  travis you fucking know it  liam a charmed bracelet of

travis yeah ill go grab it and give it to caleb  liam muttering  matt it is not magical  /none/ liam that is magical in that it is very finely crafted but it doesnt do anything expect cut me  across the chest quite deeply  travis if it had spelled the end of one of my closest friends i know i would want it so we  should probably keep it for yasha when she wakes in the bag of holding  laura whoa that bag is way better than my bag  travis its pretty big  laura we could always dye that one pink too  travis we dont have to do that  taliesin i can /none/ help with that  laura you can  taliesin

the woman we were supposed to  get in contact with we were like a day or so late but she was fine with it but she wanted us  to go kill lorenzo and the rest of the iron shepherds so it was a very convenient killing one  group of slavers with one stone  laura oh so you didnt really come /none/ to save us you came to get the money  sam no no we came to save you the moneys the bonus  laura i know nott i know you did i was just joking with you  liam no it is true the money meant fuck all  taliesin this is literally the first theyve mentioned it in my presence so  laura that means you get all of

have intertwined us for a while i need to  head east at some point  liam what is east  taliesin i dont know but im going to find out everythings telling me that i should stick around  and see where youre headed /none/ i think thats where im supposed to be  sam didnt we promise to do something for you like give you our blood or something  laura what  sam we never really discussed the finer points i assumed that you were a vampire and that you were  going to suck our blood  marisha he makes dead people tea its very nice tea  travis he makes what  sam he makes tea out of things that grow on corpses  marisha cemetery tea  matt interesting point too some of the corpses you passed by in the /none/ middle of the arena were  starting to be overgrown with fungus its quite disgusting  travis you make dead people into tea  taliesin i mean theyre going to do it eventually anyway i just usher the process along  a little bit  laura is it good tea  taliesin its very good tea  sam its pretty good  taliesin to be fair i think weve had two rounds of it at this point ive been making breakfast  marisha honestly you could make a lot of money setting up a shop somewhere and selling tea  /none/ taliesin huh  laura dont tell them its dead people tea and then wait until they drink it and then go guess  what that was made from  taliesin i mean all tea is really dead people tea when you think about it so  liam are we going to go to ophelia first and then to mollymauk or  marisha ophelia first then mollymauk its all along the way  sam sounds good  travis should we wait for yasha to wake up or do we bring her with  sam oh shoot  travis shes got a /none/ day and a spell  marisha theres some carts around back two to be exact some horses thatll make up for waterloo  and or water closet and loo and toilet oh yeah by the way we also lost like three horses  theyre all dead too  sam all the horses are gone  travis yeah i figured  laura no wc  marisha wcs gone  sam crapper john  liam hes in the fields  laura this is the worst  travis kind of already was but yeah  sam but we have a new lease on /none/ life we have new horses we have a new day lets go name some  horses and steal them  marisha sounds good  travis lets do it  matt all right  marisha we steal horses we make a nice little bed for yasha and lay her down  laura we carry her out to the cart  travis i put her in the bag of holding and  laughter  sam are there invisible cages on the carts  matt if you go ahead and check the carts still appear to be saddled up with the cages when /none/ you  approach it looks to be small bundles of produce and various packs but upon reaching the edge and  peering in your face immediately goes past the illusion and you see the tarp a heavy tarp thats  laid over the cages pulling it open the cages are still there in the cart yes  sam the cages are invisible or whatevers in the tarp is invisible  matt best you can tell whatevers under the tarp is invisible everything in the cart  marisha can we break down the cages easily or bring the cages off the /none/ cart  matt theyre pretty large cages theyre 6foot by 4foot by 4foot theyre stacked up two at a time  marisha can we get rid of them though  matt you can yeah you pull off the cages and pull off the tarp and they all come out of the  illusion and theyre normal  laura can we put the tarp back up and get under the tarp and see if we can see each other  matt you get under the tarp and youre under a tarp  sam if i stay outside and look in  /tavern/ travis its not the tarp thats the source of the illusion  matt you see all your friends getting under a tarp  marisha i put my hand through the cage bar do i see anything  matt nope  marisha fuck  sam wait whats invisible now  matt wait you guys pulled the cages and the tarp off the cart  marisha yeah  matt currently nothing seems to be changed the cart still looks like its filled with some small bundles  laura i get up on the cart  taliesin the carts magic  matt the /none/ cart is where the illusion is focused as jester steps into the cart she vanishes  laura hey  sam we have an invisible cart how long will this last  laura singing can you see me right now  liam just give me ten goddamn minutes identify the cart  matt okay  liam how does it work  matt what it is is its a localized illusion to give a fake interior appearance of a cart but  that enchantment has been made permanent through some other magical means  sam cool  marisha sick  travis well /none/ take it  sam stealth cart  travis between the stealth cart and the dome were going to be rolling dirty  liam also how long was the ride from shady creek to this compound like three or four hours  matt from shady creek its only about an hour or so from ophelias its about an hour and a half  by foot by cart youre not too sure these woods can be thick and hard to get through in large carts  liam oh so slower by cart because  matt slower by cart because youre having to /none/ ferry it through some more difficult terrain  liam ja but worth it  taliesin grab some stuff from the kitchen some blankets from upstairs some pillows so you can  actually be comfortable in the cart yeah be nice  matt all right you grab two of the horses that are still set up on the exterior you get them  forded to the cart you guys throw your cushions and blankets into the back whos going to be  guiding the cart there is still the front where the actual seat is where you can hold the reins /none/  and steer it where it goes  liam ill sit up front  taliesin ill join  matt all right so caduceus and caleb up front the rest in the back  marisha ill take one of the other horses  sam were going to take four horses  laura oh so nobodys in the cart except for yasha  sam we need horses to pull the cart right  laura that is important yes  matt two horses on the cart two horses that are free ridden by  travis caduceus and caleb  liam were on the /none/ cart  travis thats right ill ride a horse  marisha ill ride a horse  matt all right that puts jester and nott in the cart with yasha with that you pull the cart free  from where it has sunken into some of the cold mud that seems to have closed around the  wheels as the frozen temperatures of the snowfall caused it to harden eventually it pulls itself  out of that section on the side of the sour nest and begins trekking cutting its way leaving  little tracks in the snow along with the /none/ hoof prints with that beauregard you jump off and  quickly push the gates outside from the courtyard out into the savalierwood with that you begin to  trek back towards shady creek run in the mid afternoon of this now somewhat cold snowfallen  portion of the day and thats where well go ahead and take a break picking up with you guys  approaching the fantastic estate sybaritic before we get to there were going to go ahead and do  our giveaway today we have this awesome white oak tabletop dice tray from our friends at wyrmwood /none/  its nice smells good its got a

coming  your way all righty yall  sam and marisha happy birthday ashley  matt yes for those who didnt know it is ashley johnsons birthday  travis today  marisha you could have said it too  liam the reason were not overflowing with happy birthday joy and radiance is because we also have  a cold /none/ dead fury that shes not at the table  matt yeah we wanted her here badly but her shoot schedule did not allow it we wish her happy  birthday on social media and such she is amazing and we love her and we want her back asap  liam come back  matt yes  marisha singing ashley come back  matt you all begin to make your way through this section of the savalierwood following the best  pathways you can for the next hour hour and a half before you begin to break into the north  /none/ clover area of the city trying to maneuver around carefully so as to not be conspicuous  thankfully the enchantment on the cart enables you to do so without much issue however it is  also a very populated area with friends and enemies of the house you are traveling to who  wants to be responsible for trying to remain inconspicuous  liam remain inconspicuous you mean in the open not hidden by the illusion of the cart  matt yes well you still have four of you who are out in the open two on horseback and two /none/  actually bringing the cart forward  marisha weird question the carts arent sprayed on the side with iron shepherds  travis theres no branding we have to worry about  taliesin white stallions theres a death star painted on the side  marisha okay cool  liam just a jesus fish  marisha ill flip my coat inside out to my brown side and put up the hood  matt perfect  liam i look like a peasant ill stay put  taliesin ill switch to something inconspicuous ill join the somewhat inconspicuouslooking  humans attempting to create a /none/ uniform similar to beaus  matt okay  travis oh shit you can do that too huh  taliesin yeah  sam are you going to do that  travis well i dont want to be the only one ill make myself a disheveled brunetlooking guy  with a sickass goatee  matt all righty  sam me and jester will be in the invisibility cone  marisha i take everything i just said back  sam were going to do each others hair and make faces at everyone else in the group  travis birds galore  matt this /town/ part in the afternoon its bustling enough towards the central main clover street  with your preparation it doesnt seem that you catch too much attention thankfully you do  eventually make your way to the outskirts of the twostory estate sybaritic where you see the  familiar dark red wood and the fence with sixinch spear tips still aggressively daring anybody to  vault over or make entry the guards that you had previously encountered when you first arrived  immediately turn and you see the two on the inside of the courtyard and the one thats  outside /none/ of the gate as another one appears to be stepping into his position he had left for a  moment all look over as you begin to approach get their crossbows ready one of the guards at  the very front the one thats on the outside of the wall already begins to approach with his hand  on the side of a sheathed blade who goes there  travis what are we doing  liam good evening good day good afternoon we are expected by miss mardun  matt please wait here ill be right back im going to /none/ go check he closes the gate behind him  locks it leaves you there and the two other guards keep their crossbows at the ready but not  aimed just careful and ready to go  travis weve met with her already  marisha yeah  travis how did it go  liam very well  marisha shes super hot  liam true  matt a few moments pass and the front doors to the estate open once more the guard returns  approaches unlocks the gate opens it very well you may enter bring your he opens the  /none/ other side of the gate but it looks like its not quite wide enough to get the full cart into it  youll have to leave your cart here  marisha no thats not doable do you have a wider gate around back or something like that  matt we do not well watch it dont worry well keep an eye on it its not going anywhere  marisha you personally  matt yes its my job im stationed literally right here  travis i hope you have some extra hands were going to be picking up very heavy equipment /none/ and  lugging it all the way from the house back to the gate if we cant bring the cart in i dont mind  its just  matt all right we can muster a few additional hands  travis coughs  matt ill go ahead and put in the request  liam i know this cart like the back of my hand and if one inch of it is touched i will know  matt do not worry  travis i would tell this cart that well be right back stay put cart  sam cooing  marisha hes /dung/ very personal with the cart  matt he gives an awkward stare very well the mistress is waiting for you he steps inside the  guards flank behind as the rest of you nott yasha and jester are staying within the cart the  rest of you make your way through the courtyard into the main chamber into the familiar interior  noticing this for the first time this beautiful estate looks like it was built from imported wood  a dark redbrown maroon wood color you can see elements of gold leafing in some of the designs  have /none/ been carved at the edges where different large wall areas come together and theres a  slight pillar that separates it from panel to panel the closer you get to it you also see that  theyve been weathered over time some of the wood is starting to warp a bit and upon closer  inspection upkeep is better seen at a distance you enter the interior of the warm foyer you can  see the staircase that ascends upward you can see the portraits of figures that seem to be members  of this same family it is both /dung/ beautiful and imposing to enter this chamber the energy here  seems very tense while youve only seen a handful of guards you feel like there are more eyes on  you than meets the eye a moment later stepping down the staircase you hear the footsteps of  ophelia mardun you see a voluptuous tiefling woman with dark ashgray skin vibrant yellow  eyes pupilless sharpened fangs that curl down from the top of her teeth slicked back long black  hair that seems to almost meet the back of her ankles her horns curve backward and go straight /none/  up towards the rear of her head her coat this time not of the same colonial garb you had seen  before but appears to be wearing a long deep maroon robe that drags down the steps behind her  its tight across in the front shes in more of a leisurely appearance but she descends one hand  on the front of the robe the other slightly gliding down the banister looking over this  strange bunch that have entered recognizing you two not recognizing you two and says so as she  begins to descend down the /none/ final bit of the staircase i see some familiar faces but  strangely some i do not who are your friends before i come any closer  liam well as i said on our previous meeting we have vetted appropriate people for the task at  hand which has been completed that is all you need to know  matt completed you say are you to tell me that these iron shepherds have been dealt with  liam everyone other than the common folk that they had taken away have been put to the blade or  burnt to cinders /none/  matt and what proof have you brought me  travis i open up the bag of holding and pull out lorenzos glaive  matt fetch it for me one of the guards comes over and puts his hands on the glaive and waits  for you to release it he walks over and hands it to ophelia she grasps it and grunts its got  some heft to it she takes it and looks it over very well you are absolutely certain there are  no signs left behind to trace it no one saw you no one followed /none/ you  liam you know the one who wields that weapon  matt i know of the one that did yes  liam this one broke his jaw almost off of his face and then his skull was burned to ash we  murdered everyone in that house who was not a farmer it is empty  matt make a persuasion check with advantage she wants to believe you but is  liam natural 20  matt her yellow eyes darken into slits as she inspects you for that brief pregnant pause in  conversation you feel this probing stare /none/ you cannot see where the pupils glance but you feel  like you are being looked up and down and then every aspect of your facial expressions and  mannerisms being instantaneously processed she leans back comfortably in her stance now  previously with an intense force of confrontational energy she now seems to relax  takes the glaive and hands it off to one of her guards and says please prepare that for mounting  within my collection  marisha um if you dont mind it would actually be greatly appreciated to us if we kept that for  /none/ the fallen member of our party  matt right very well leave it with them please the guard that was taking it off turns  around and brings it back and hands it to you  marisha thats very kind of you  matt consider it a favor remember it please very well i am indeed impressed and intrigued  zemas she shouts off down one of the hallways and you see a servant rush around the corner  yes prepare two carriages and a package for entry to the empire we shall be gone for a couple  of /dung/ weeks to secure business with a contact of mine notify anselm of my absence please we  leave at dusk of course my lady and he rushes off are you ready to leave at dusk  marisha you want us to go with you  matt i was under the impression based on my contacts with the gentleman that we were to  return together  marisha thats right we were supposed to escort her back yep  liam we are amenable  matt very well  liam that is just fine there are more of us waiting a ways /none/ away  matt how many ive only called two carriages one for myself and one for you do you require more  liam we have three more drei  matt so a third carriage it becomes a bit conspicuous in travel  liam well we have come with our own means of transportation we can travel with you  matt very well two carriages same as said before i will prepare collect my things i  suggest you do the same we leave soon i am excited to travel alongside you she smiles  turns and begins to ascend the /none/ steps  travis what in the hot fuck is going on with her  marisha i think hot fuck is actually very appropriate on a few levels  travis yeah okay  marisha i dont know  liam clears throat you could keep some of those puns in your head you know  marisha why does she want to leave this cant be good right  travis we were supposed to escort her back im sure she has more business with the gentleman no  liam well the job is the job we will be watching our own backs regardless /none/ but the job is  the job  travis we were going to stop on the way back though werent we  liam thats not too much to ask  travis no its not  marisha its along the way  taliesin this is the job this is what brought you up here interesting  marisha its not that this was really the job it was more like there were two jobs you had to  accept both as opposed to one or the other and the one was doable and we did it and the other one  travis /none/ bit off more than we could chew by us saying yes to both  liam boy i wonder how long before ophelias ready to go  marisha well she said the morning  travis dusk  matt which right now based on how early in the afternoon it is gives you roughly about two and a  half three hours before dusk hits  travis maybe well wait for her outside the gates with our cart  matt is there anything you guys wish to do or prepare while youre waiting for her to join you  outside of the /town/ estate  sam us  matt anybody  liam this is the sticks right  matt comparably this is the northern side of the clover plaza a little bit to the northwest  imagine this is like the sparse gated community of the lawless city the northern side of the  street is where most of the houses live the various feuding factions its where the money  goes right around the road especially south of it and east of it is where you start getting into  the slums and the folks that exist here because they have no /dung/ other choice  travis the guards or the people that she has working for her are they wearing any sort of face  protection head protection or is it open  matt the guards that are inside the house are not wearing face protection theyre wearing hide  armor comprised of multiple thick strips of cured hide dyed to a dark maroon color there is  definitely a color scheme going on here in the interior and ophelias preferred means of wear  the ones outside do have a very simple leather cap with heavy straps like a romantype style /town/ that  descend past the sides of the chin but thats about it  travis can i ask in your previous engagements with her how far are we trusting her  liam and marisha eh  travis no superficial yeah  marisha not at all yeah  liam i think that everyone in this town is dangerous so eyes wide open  marisha yeah you guys probably didnt see a lot considering you were in cages when you came  through but this is a shitty shithole like a really shitty shithole  taliesin i do live here  marisha /town/ you live in a very nice garden an hour north of here the city is garbage  liam do you spend time in the no you have been alone  marisha you havent left in 18 years  taliesin well ive left i just havent left in a while ive got to come to town sometimes get  things get supplies  liam it still stands its pretty shitty  travis yeah and good things come from shit right like flowers  taliesin im going to have to make a little confession i really havent been many other  places /none/ so i suppose i really dont actually have a great basis of comparison  travis you didnt travel much  taliesin no oh yeah i havent traveled much at all  liam hes been living in a cemetery  travis living  liam exclusively for a number of years  marisha it is very beautiful  taliesin thank you  liam still a cemetery though  travis we asked this im sure youre whispering hes alive right  marisha he is we asked the same question  taliesin very much so  travis strained cool yep  marisha yeah the /none/ smell comes with it its got a little musk yeah  travis musty as shit yeah okay  liam its strong at first but  travis like sandalwood kind of  liam yes but you get used to it and it mellows the longer youre around him  marisha when you two mix together it has this meatloaf smell  liam it has not been that long since i took a shower i dont know why this running gag is continuing  matt as this is happening you guys are talking and spending time within the cart  laura were /none/ doing each others hair and im using my mending cantrip to fix up yashas clothes  matt which is helping tremendously in the process  sam but shes still lying unconscious  matt shes still unconscious the enchantment does last for a protracted period of time you do  begin to hear a few pairs of horse hooves coming up louder behind where the cart is currently set  laura can they see the cart  sam i think they can see the cart they just cant see us in it  laura can they hear us  matt you /dung/ guys can see outside of it because there is no tarp covering the space  laura do they look like they can hear us  matt you turn around and look you dont know if they can hear you or not but you see two rather  extravagantlooking carriages making their way towards you you can see this dark wood with gold  detailing on the outsides each has a curtained window on the right and the left sets of large  spoked wheels on each side and each one has two horses affixed to the front there is a /none/ driver at  the front of each one  laura nott moon them moon them right now  sam yes i will moon them  matt there is no reaction but you are indeed mooning them  laura laughs loudly i mean we laugh very quietly just in case  matt make a stealth check  laura oh no i rolled really bad on my stealth check eight  matt this one older fellow his nose has grown over time to the point where its overpowering the  front of his face and hes got this rough white hair across /none/ his chin where he hasnt shaved in a  bit but hes dressed raggedly though nice if you imagine one of the ghosts in haunted mansion  before it died its how hes dressed and as it horse clopping he hears you laughing and he  looks hello  travis yasha wakes up startles  matt he steps down from it laughter as you guys are stepping outside you hear this as well  and you see the two carriages brought up on the sides of the estate shortly thereafter ophelia  comes behind you through the door in the /dung/ long colonial coat that you had first met her in  behind her you see two other guards carrying a number of packed handbags she points all right  please place them the front one is mine within there they start loading the bags up into the  carriage up on top of it one of the guys are lifting the other up and they are passing the bags  along as hes putting it up and theyre strapping it down with rope across the top of it for travel  until eventually she is escorted outside of the grounds /none/ she looks to you all outside of the  cart those that she can see and she goes should anyone ask along our journeys i am lady  quinn denzala of nogvurot going to see my ailing mother in deastok you are my personal guard if  you mess that up well you may have more blood on your hands so it would behoove you to pay  attention hmm  travis of course  liam of course quinn  matt very good now let us be off in comfort she steps up into the carriage and one of the /none/  guards helps her she closes the door behind her the other carriage doors open and are left open  for whoever would like to travel along with them  sam are you guys going to go with her  liam we need our cart to be driven  taliesin i can drive that  laura yeah  liam in the two carriages  matt theres one carriage thats hers and another carriage  liam just hers  matt she does not want to travel with anybody at least not at the moment  liam i will enter the second /none/ carriage if they are looking for people  matt all right thats caleb  marisha how many people  matt currently just one  marisha that are sitting with her  matt oh with her  marisha how many that she wants to sit with her  sam and laura she doesnt want anyone  matt she has her own carriage  liam i think perhaps we are the intermediaries here why dont you ride with me  marisha okay  laura theres still a horse that has to be ridden  sam we can tie it to the other /none/ ones  laura okay  taliesin ill explain whats happening to the horses so that they move appropriately  laura you can speak to the horses  matt as you guys are hitching the horses to the other horses ophelia leans out of a window and  goes this is intended to be nothing but a visitation travel there is no reason to have  additional beasts do you care for your beasts are they sentimental to you  liam no not at all cut them loose  matt cut them loose and whatever you lose i will happily repurchase /none/ for you when we arrive in zadash  marisha its not that we dont care for these animals its just that we cared for water closet  and loo and john way more  liam shes missing a lot of context on that sentence  marisha i just wanted you to know  matt i appreciate your clarification  marisha but yeah fuck these horses  matt indeed closes the curtains on her window  taliesin i explain this to the horses i let them know whats going on telling the two that theyre  ready to go about their /none/ business  sam whos going to pull our carriage  matt you still have two horses on your cart but there are the two being ridden separately those  horses begin to wander off finding their way through the savalierwood southward  sam i named them and everything  laura theyre just going to be eaten though theyre just horses  sam i named all of the horses while you guys were in there i named them waterloo fernando mamma  mia and dancing queen  laughter  matt well say goodbye to the two of your choosing nott  /none/ travis yeah which ones  marisha definitely mamma mia  liam got to keep mamma mia  marisha taliesin and laura no  sam i guess fernando and waterloo  laura mamma mia and dancing queen are staying with us  matt there you go okay as they wander off you hear hyah lashing horse clopping the  carriages begin to pick up speed caduceus youre driving the cart  taliesin yeah give them a little if you wouldnt mind  matt with that it picks up as well and now your train of two carriages and your cart begin /none/ to make  their way southward through shadycreek run you guys begin to curve through the clover plaza  where you can see the bustle of the city is definitely making its way towards the latter half  of the day the sunset is cresting probably in the next hour or so keeping watch the ones that are  looking about would be caduceus youd have a good view you guys have a view throughout the  illusion so you three  liam can i interject for a second  matt sure  liam since this is a lot of /none/ time thats passing and its just beauregard and i in this carriage  can i as a ritual spell cast detect magic and check out the cart around us  matt sure you finish focusing on the spell and as you release your arcane incantation to sense  the area around you theres nothing about the cart that appears magical since youre focusing  on that and you are  travis i guess im up front with caduceus  matt all right i would like you four or you three and you to go ahead and roll perception  checks /none/ please  sam 14 jesus  travis 12  taliesin 24  laura aw 21 but still good  matt the two of you noticing as the cloud covered skies the snowfall has lightened its not as  heavy as it was in the morning but there is still a faint soft falling of snowflakes in the air  the now gray and white city with the edges of the roads mucked with dirty snow and mud being  tracked through from all the foot and cart traffic you do notice off to the sides near one  of the /none/ inns or taverns that you have not had the opportunity to visit yet within the clover plaza  you see a small gathering or meeting that catches your attention you glance over and you wouldnt  have context actually none of you have the context for this the two of you see a small  meeting between two really burlylooking figures in armor a similar style or at least a  haphazard patchworkstyle of armor and adornments as some of the others that patrol the streets  keeping an eye out look like thugs a bit you see two of /dung/ them meeting with two figures that are in  heavy cloak and hood because of your perceptive abilities you notice that they are of a similar  skin color as ophelia their features are very fine and their lithe bodies vanish within the  heavy cloaks that guide them you do see bits of armor protruding off the side of one that appear  to be dark and insectlike  laura does it look like the guy that we met down in the sewers  matt it does as youre watching out you see them discussing there is a brief /none/ transaction in the  shadows of this alleyway and a handshake from the two cloaked figures and these two others as you  ride by and continue southward  laura shady deals happening over there  taliesin oh ive never seen one before are they buying  laura i dont know theyre probably selling drugs to each other  taliesin oh thats cool thats super cool  laura wait a minute gasps wait a minute those were those guys  taliesin which guys  laura the guys that were gasps nott  sam what  laura i just saw one /none/ of those guys that had the thing  travis the dodecahedron  sam you saw a drow creature from xhorhas you saw a crick  laura dont say that thats really rude i saw them they were over there they had cloaks on and  i saw them what if they can sense us and they know that we have the thing that theyre looking  for i keep looking at them to see if they notice us  matt you pay very close attention as you pass through the main thoroughfare of the clover plaza  they dont seem /town/ to notice or pay any mind to your presence and eventually they are out of sight and  you have no means of keeping tabs on them as you now head towards the southern side of the clover  street heading towards the outskirts of shadycreek run eventually out of the city  entirely as the buildings begin to give way to hovels and huts and tents and shacks you begin  to see really where the bulk of those who have escaped or not allowed entry into the empire now  reside you see mudcovered folks that are bundled /none/ up for body heat in this cold weather many that  are outstretching hands in your direction for handouts and others that get too close to the  outside of ophelias carriage the cartdriver grabs a switch off the side and whacks one of them  on the hand and he recoils from it and darts off and a few others hiss and run off with him  eventually that gives way to the path that leads to the quannah breach familiar for those of you  who had traveled here previously you can see the dunrock mountains ahead the /none/ large spiky crags  that make up that mark this mountain range that is the divide between the northern grey wastes and  the descent into the dwendalian empire the greying wildlands that you reside in begin to give  way as you see the gate of the uttolot familys exit from the region as you approach similar  figures that originally greeted you at dusk when you had arrived here seem to be stationed there  as they approach the carriage before they can even raise a word ophelia leans one arm out the  side and throws a /none/ small coin purse in their direction one of them catches it opens it real  fast and gives a motion the two gates open before the carriage there you get to see the  familiar sharpened wooden pikes that are adorned with skulls and pieces of whatever other warnings  they could amass for anybody who attempted to pass without paying the toll passing beyond those  gates you curve around the corner and now youre between the sheared cliffs of the quannah breach  where it looks like this mountain was pulled apart leaving behind this strange snaking maze /none/  of open pathway smooth on the inside of these otherwise rough mountains like wind has over  time eroded and driven smooth the interior through here you can hear the faint winds blowing  through occasionally bursting with loud whistles and this droning moan sound that seems to be  created by the wind pushing against these weirdly carved pathways through these drivers have done  this many times and very deftly maneuver through when it does fork off in different directions  they knowingly take the path that you assume will bring you to the end of this /none/ journey after a bit  of time passing through this strange ravine it opens up once more to a very large gate you can  see crownsguard there expecting you as you pass through the crownsguard begin to approach the  carriages stop and ophelia steps out as she does so another one of the carriage drivers the one  thats driving your carriage beau and caleb steps off to join her with a small scroll case  she steps up to the captain of this watch from a distance they begin to have a conversation you  cant hear /none/ it its hushed voices or at least not loud enough to reach your distance  marisha i wish you could still read lips  laura i know thats what i was thinking i cant read lips  matt nah thats the old campaign  sam i could sneak up and  travis caleb what about your cat  liam are you whispering to me through the doorway or  travis no im leaning over the carriage like hey what about your gato  liam ja dying sound  laura hey look what i can do  sam what  laura /none/ i am going to use what is the thing the cloak of shadows im going to use cloak of  shadows on myself  matt all right it gives you about 12 seconds of invisibility  laura wait thats it motherfucker i thought it gave me a lot more than that  matt its until the end of your next turn  laura ah shit its inbattle hold on look what i can do  sam whered you go oh my god oh hi  matt best use of channel divinity in dd history right there ladies and gentlemen  /none/ laura i thought it lasted longer than that  sam it was really cool though  laura did you see that i went invisible  sam you were gone it was crazy  laura ive been thinking about that for a while  sam well next time you use it maybe it will have a purpose  laughter  travis status quo  marisha yeah i was going to say i do not miss sam riegel giving me shit about my spell usage  matt as this is happening and youre watching carefully across the way the scroll case is /none/  opened and a series of papers are handed to the crownsguard there then a handful of coin are  passed over by ophelia to the captain reads over the papers hands them back gives a hand motion  to a group of about six or seven crownsguard at the gate they begin to open it and entry is  given to the empire in the few days youve been gone the carriages pick up speed once more and  you reenter the dwendalian empire heading towards the northern side of the marrow valley  welcome back  travis holy /none/ shit  liam excuse me once were past the border and time has passed and the two empire kids are  sitting alone in this carriage caleb staring out the window not even looking at beauregard beauregard  marisha mmhmm  liam who are you you know an awful lot about me now you are not some sigh youth throwing  themselves on drink as you tried to claim when we first met you are clearly tied to something  greater than that you are not some fuckup who are you  marisha its funny i thought you were going /none/ to say something like man the empires sure fucked  up i was going to be like right i was just thinking the same thing its just like what  jester said we can read each others thoughts  liam thats a separate issue were very different but not completely i would feel a  little safer if i knew a little more about you  marisha well you know im a monk of the cobalt soul i actually dumped a lot of this on nott she  asked we were a little tipsy  liam okay  marisha i /none/ was feeling vulnerable in the moment it doesnt happen often she caught me in a  perfect window  liam her or you  marisha nott did wait both nevermind  liam right  marisha i never intended to be a monk of the cobalt soul my father sent me away to the  monastery when i wasnt what he wanted me to be and i was kind of a dick so  liam why are you out here in the wastelands  marisha i ran away from the cobalt soul and they gave me a raise in rank because /none/ of it that was  kind of cool really just further instilled my rebellion to be totally honest  liam now you what you want to follow the orders of the cobalt soul you want to do whatever they  ask you to do or something you want to do why are you running around with criminals and me  marisha my whole life was dictated by establishment that i didnt have a lot of control  over the cobalt soul has this underlying faction that helps uproot corrupt establishment i know i  scoffed at the idea of being /none/ a part of a system thats supposed to take down systems it doesnt  really make sense but you know maybe you if anyone can understand the idea of fighting fire  with fire thats why im doing this  liam this is all orders you are following  marisha no they just want information im out in the world at the ground level people like us  tend to have our fingers on the pulse of whats being said around the city sometimes its not  necessarily something that a monk in full accolades can always accomplish  liam /none/ okay so a little bit of official business a little bit of your own personal axe to grind  marisha yeah  liam repeating ja danke  marisha does that make you uncomfortable  liam no  marisha cool  liam exaggerated cool  marisha ew dont do that  laughter  matt continuing southward through the night eventually the carriages pull off to the side for  the evening  laura me and nott are having a dance party in ours  matt laughs that no one can see  liam high pitched im alive im happy  matt /town/ ophelia doesnt leave her carriage but eventually the carts and the two carriages are  circled around a campfire the drivers begin to cook their own meal and you are allowed to use the  space to make what you wish  marisha have we made it outside the city  matt you guys are far beyond the city youre beyond the quannah breach you havent reached the  main road yet you are just south of the breach maybe by four hours or so youre still north  north side if you want to  marisha so were still /none/ north of the crispvale thicket  matt yes far north a few days north of that like three days north  taliesin ill cook up whats there and well have a meal  matt all right for the purpose of expediency you have another day and a half two days worth of  travel the snowfall hasnt come in flurries thankfully its just been a gentle continuous  snowfall chilled as it is the blankets have come in handy for those riding in the cart as the  carriages themselves help insulate somewhat from the temperature there comes a point /town/ where all of  you who were present beauregard caleb nott where your hair begins to stand on your skin and  this deep leadlike sinking sensation clenches the bottom of your stomach as youve a short  time ago met up with the glory run road heading southward you begin to come upon two  familiarlooking mounds hills that flank the sides of the road  sam i will message caleb with my little wire and say do you think we should stop you can reply to  this message  liam yes i pull out my own wire /town/ and i aim towards ophelia and say miss denzala we require  a few moments on the side of the road here  matt she responds a quick pit stop if that is what you require  liam ja ten 20 minutes nothing more  matt very well the carriage at the front comes to a slow stop the second carriage comes to a  stop as you all begin to step out of your spaces the soft white hills and white fields and small  elements of the slushy road immediately catch your vision there towards the southern side /none/ of the  eastern hill you see the single wooden cross embedded in the somewhat hard cold earth there  not yet removed from the cross whether it be by luck or superstition there is the white  snowdappled multicolored coat of mollymauk tealeaf  marisha i grab jester by the hand and walk her over  laura ive never actually been to a grave before  marisha really  laura not of someone i knew  marisha right that makes sense  laura i get down on my knees i think hes still here with us  marisha i /none/ think so too  laura thank you molly  marisha you know i grabbed his stupid cards  laura i love those cards  marisha you want to draw one  laura yeah  liam caleb scoops nott up out of the cart that shes in and we watch from a distance  laura what did i pull  matt what did she pull  taliesin oh god i got to think about this i think you pulled the moon again  laura i pulled this the first time i met him  marisha old faithful  laura well this /none/ is his card i put it next to the little stick  marisha sighs  travis ill hop off the carriage and walk over staring at the coat ill summon the new sword  matt you watch as the blade emerges the golden sheen of the summers dance is crooked towards the  tip the previously smooth curvature of it seeming to have blended with the design of the falchion  its a strange exaggerated blend of the two  travis in the way that i was taught by vandren i extend the sword to my side bring it up /none/ in a  salute swing it back down ive met a lot of people but i dont think ill ever meet another  character as unique as you molly  liam what time of day is it  matt its about midday as you look around at the nearby clouds you glance back towards the cart  and you see stepping out of the cloak of illusion the leathered conscious figure of  yasha having shaken herself from the illusory binds groggy and confused she steps towards the  rest of you whats going on  laura im sorry yasha /dung/  travis while they were coming to rescue us  sam we lost him  liam he tried to get to your side he tried very hard  matt she takes a few more steps she seems to have tuned the rest of you out and is focused on  the marker it happened again she walks towards the grave the crunching of her boots through the  condensed snowfall until eventually she comes to rest at the very point of where he was interred  falls to her knees her shoulders slumped forward her hair dark to white tumbling /none/ past the front of  her torso turned away from you all just quiet  laura i put my hand on her shoulder  marisha i put my hand on the other one  matt both of you feel her shoulders quaking you cant tell if its tears anger whatever it is  its emotion you hear a growl the growl gets louder and louder as she begins to stand up all  of you hear this echoing scream from the depths of yashas soul this mournful baleful cry of anger  and anguish shatter the still cold air of /none/ this midday sky the blackened skeletal wings of her  fallen aasimar form force both of your hands to recoil she looks up to the sky in the distance  you see two or three flashes of blue lightning from a coalescing storm far to the east her head  lowers without meeting any of your gaze she puts her hand forward on the top of the marker steps  around it and begins walking towards the storm  laura and travis yasha  matt she puts her hand up ill find you when im ready the wings flicker out /none/  liam knowing how young nott is i hold her closer and rest her head on my shoulder and walk away  from this very painful thing to look at  taliesin may i im going to walk up move a little bit of the snow and dig my hand as deep  into the ground as i can and attempt to do the full casting of decompose and see what i get  laura are you going to make molly tea  marisha whispering whats he doing  matt you finish focusing on the cantrip it feels like it /none/ sufficiently took root although you do  not see any difference as it is a bit beneath the dirt  taliesin something will be here  marisha what did you just do  taliesin i made the earth remember him something will be here i get back on the cart and leave them  travis ive said it before but im sorry we werent here to help we havent known each other  that long but youve shown us incredible kindness and care and im very grateful for that i will  return the favor if its ever needed  /none/ marisha after a while you lose track of favors its okay  travis ive never had many favors done my way  marisha it wasnt a favor though you guys are the only friends ive ever had most people in my  life just leave anyone im not driving away i guess i should probably try and start keeping  people around at this point  laura i need to get myself some diamonds  marisha that is an incredibly random thought  laura no its so that this doesnt happen again  sam i think he would have been /none/ happy that you got to say goodbye but we should keep going  laura softly yeah  liam come everyone molly wanted us to keep living  marisha and make things better  liam back in the carts  matt as you all turn around and begin making your way crunching through the snow outside of her  carriage you see ophelia mardun arms crossed leaning against the outside of it as you  approach she has a curious tilt to her head and she goes i assume this is where you lost  someone unfortunate  liam there is /none/ always a cost  matt dont i know it well may whoever they are may their soul find peace to whatever that  means to them she turns around and gets back up into the carriage with that you all assemble  back onto your respective carts and places and hyah the carts begin to pick up pace once more  and silently you all glance over your shoulder unable to look away until eventually the hills  break the horizon and youre unable to see the last standing coat and grave site of mollymauk  now heading southward for /town/ a few more days trekking down you find your way towards the  crispvale thicket on the glory run road there is the crossroads which turn westward and then  curving outside of the crispvale thicket towards hupperdook and the silberquel ridge eventually  after a couple more days you pass by and you can see in the distance as the night gets dark the  glowing lights and the fireworks of hupperdooks evening celebrations memories calling back to  that wonderfully colored person all the joy they brought the flowers in their hair and horns  eventually heading back /none/ towards the crossroads that leads towards felderwin and berleben  following that path about eight days of travel lead you finally to the visual sight of the  central metropolis of zadash ahead of you for whatever a home could be for this motley family  this is it and youve made it by the time you arrive after an evenings camp you hit the  northern gates outside of zadash by about one oclock in the afternoon it would be ophelia  presents her paperwork to the crownsguard that guard the exterior gate without issue youre let  in /none/ and back to the familiar cobblestone streets of the district you can see the trispires towering  over the exterior walls that mark that district memories of what youve done here and times that  youve first met and made whatever small impact and strange experiences this city had before  youve returned so mighty nein what do you wish to do  travis out of game how long have we been gone when did we leave zadash weve been gone for  marisha at least three weeks right  travis feels like a year  liam i dont know /none/ but caleb would know it exactly  matt caleb would know and im sure critrolestats too would know i will  guesstimate since the last time i checked in with them on this and the events you guys have gone  through youre three and a half weeks in youre pushing somewhere im guessing after all that  eight days of travel coming down here a little bit less than that probably you guys were moving  slow because youre moving carts not on horseback youre getting pretty close to the 30day mark  liam also since we spent so /none/ much time in those carriages i would have spent a full day with my  lucky rock that i found and those ideas i had have come to fruition i have set it just so  matt all right  travis you got a lucky rock  sam yep thats what this game is about now travis  liam i have luck again i got a new feat  travis oh  liam cheers  travis hey man old tricks the best trick  matt no  liam never again  matt so what do you wish to do youve /town/ returned to  sam we have to bring ophelia to the gentleman right  liam yeah but hold on also rewind seven or eight days on the road how much money do we all have  sam oh i did the math between all the platinum and gold that we found we should each get 163 gold pieces  liam 163  marisha did you break down the platinum  sam yes  travis 101 platinum 131 gold  liam not as much as i wanted  laura wait a minute how much gold do i  sam including yasha /none/ who i assume took her share  liam of course she did  travis yes we threw it and it landed in her pocket when she ghosted out  taliesin am i getting in this as well  sam youre part of this as well  taliesin wow thats awfully nice  travis were going to have an introductory period you stay for two weeks and then we give  you your money  taliesin that seems very prudent  laura where do i add money  matt theres a currency tab  liam actions spell equipment and then touch /none/ on the icons of the coins in dd beyond  laura wait a minute but didnt you guys steal some money from me  sam we took a bunch of your gold  marisha we took about 70 gold  liam no of course not  sam we took 70 gold  laura i got a lot of tweets about it  taliesin thanks guys  sam we took some of mollys gold  liam the internets full of troublemakers  taliesin thanks guys thats the last time we let you be in on our secrets so its how much /none/  gold how much platinum  sam 163 gold i just broke it down into gold  liam but its all platinum right  sam who cares  liam he might  sam matt did we find a bank to break change on the way  matt i can say if youd like to there are ways to transition the money for ease you can say  gold piece value for keeping tabs on it but you can say that a portion of it is platinum for ease  of travel though you have a bag of holding its not /none/ a huge issue  sam okay  matt bag of holding is one of those items where eventually when you reach a certain level youre  like you know what lets not worry about all that copper and silver and gold piece weight with you  liam we all have roughly 30something platinum  travis dope  matt be glad you rolled at least a 15 on that investigation check or you never would have found  a bag of holding  travis holy jesus  laura oh my god  liam detective  marisha i rolled like crap considering /none/  matt i know i dont show the notes there regularly but that is the 15 plus investigation  travis yep oh my god  liam we dont doubt you matt we dont doubt you i know you dont sleep i know you stare at a  computer monitor and think up numbers for us nonstop  matt i should be better about being a human being  liam robotic voice its all good  matt the carriages make their way beelining as if they know where to go towards the evening nip  sam do we remember the code /none/ to get in what is it you say like i need a drink  liam these pretzels are making me thirsty  sam yeah what is it i am here to help  marisha its like i need to speak to the gentleman  laura i want some milk or something  liam its a phrase  marisha i have it written down somewhere  sam maybe ophelia knows  marisha im sure were fine  sam ophelia do you know the secret code  liam id like to offer many gifts  matt that is indeed it  liam /none/ bitches  matt the carriages eventually find their way snaking through the sometimes narrow streets of  zadash until eventually you find your way to the outskirts of the evening nip the carriages stop  i imagine the carts would come to a stop as well those who are driving them ophelia steps out and  her drivers hold view on this ophelia heads towards and waits at the doorway to the evening  nip one of her drivers comes up behind her with the bags that she had packaged in the carriage  and as you guys step off /dung/ of them one of the carriages is then brought around the back to the  evening nip she has her arms crossed well are you all coming  marisha yeah  liam yeah of course  matt good follow me she steps inside as you all step into the dark interior of the tavern the  first thing you see amongst the various empty tables and booths in this small divey tavern the  familiar smell of stained wood and strong liquors spilled on floors that have long warped and been  stained with all sorts of drinks and chemicals /none/ you see the gruff dwarven bartender clive look  back at you his chin chewing something on the inside of his mouth ah i was given word you  might show up most likely not mind you but word was given go ahead  laura i have many gifts  matt right right no ive seen you before  laura yeah but i do have many gifts though  matt all right well bring them up  sam it worked  matt ophelia looks like she is trying to recall something shes like its round that way she  follows /none/ you in it looks like she is trying to recall like its been a while since shes been here  marisha i go yeah its this way thats to the bathroom  matt right i know i remember  travis as were heading down ill drop my mask of many faces  matt you find the trap door open it and you begin to descend the tight spiral staircase that  leads into the underchambers of the gentlemans lair as you reach the base of it you can hear  the sound of a lazy harp playing inside the stonecase /tavern/ chamber across the way you can see  the individual playing the harp is kara whos leaned against the bar on a stool her legs up on  the edge of a table and just a little small compact harp which she is plucking away at  lazily looks like she may have been imbibing early this day the usual suspects fill two of the  tables the same ogre guardian eyeing you all with both familiarity and general mindless suspicion  travis kutha hows it been  matt grunts  travis yeah very talkative for him actually  matt /none/ the left table appears to be rather crowded there is a card game afoot the gentleman is  amongst this group most of the general attendees of this area the underworks seem to have been  gathered here theres seven players at the table at this point and the others are just watching  from the outskirts and theyre in the middle of a rather tense hand there is quite a pile of coin  a variety of copper silver and gold all thrown in a handful of platinum thrown in the mix this  looks like some sort of /none/ crescendo as the gentleman is there looking at his cards in his hand his  eyes quickly glance up and notice you approach and he gives an acknowledging nod and he goes  right back to his hand hes focused on the other players at the table behind him you can see  looming sorah his halfgiant guardian still standing there over him her arms crossed and she  just watches as you approach and then looks very carefully over everyone at the table to make sure  everyones hands are visible at this point everyones hands are called and /none/ one by one each  hand hits the table and then at once you see this raucous cry and scream of excitement and boos  all at once and the gentleman throws his cards down shaking his head as he accepts defeat and  one of his handyman manages to scrape the coins off the table he goes and reaches over to a bowl  on the table behind him and pulls what looks to be a fresh strawberry thats been cleaned perfectly  none of the green remaining at the top pops it into his mouth chews for a /none/ second and looks over  to the rest of you as he glances at the direction and points a finger everyone looks over their  shoulder and notices your approach and they begin to pick up their cards and it seems like the  gaming session is done with your arrival the gentleman looks over and goes my my my  laughs i would have easily read my opponents had my eyes not been so blinded by beauty as he  looks towards ophelia he sits up and she puts her hand out and he takes the hand and kisses /none/ it and  then in one rapid movement grabs her arm stands up and sweeps her around in his arm and brings  her in for this really passionate kiss theres a moment where theyre both just locked in before he  goes loud grunt and pulls away and grasps his lip and you can see theres blood now curling  down she sits there and licks the blood and goes it has been awhile my azure lover however  business before pleasure he wipes his lip a bit for a second well youve upheld your promise  and sent /none/ it seems a successful endeavor right i assume since youve returned with her she  goes they are a very capable team indeed consider our debt paid she says to the  gentleman now i would like to see their debt paid as well for they have paid for their  service in blood the gentleman stands up at his table of course my dear of course i am sorry  to hear that he looks amongst you all and looks over to you and gives a curious look and keeps  glancing about ah i see what she refers /none/ to my apologies however that is the way of the  entrepreneurial sellsword is it not and he seems to be making a calculation in his mind for a  moment we are on schedule  laura did you get my messages  matt i did and thank you very much actually the storehouse is already up and running again so  thank you very much for the notification that saved us some time as well  sam thats the tree place right  matt that is a way of explaining it yes  sam also mr gentleman sir we /none/ didnt catch you at a bad time did we it seems that you just  stepped out of the shower or something should we come back after youve dried yourself off and made  yourself presentable  matt you watch as the glimmer of confidence in his eyes sets into this glare for a second and  then he laughs ill be fine well your contract is fulfilled ms mardun and i will take  the week to reestablish our trade line and i think youve earned every copper he looks over  his shoulder and two of his various /none/ goons come over with a heavy chest strained grunt onto the  table it hits with a very mighty strike and the whole table shakes for a second they open it it  is filled with gold and platinum coins  marisha pay day  matt glancing in its mostly platinum  travis got hundreds yall  matt he pushes it forward and it comes to about 600 platinum pieces and 250 gold pieces  liam 3250 gold its platinum plus gold around 600 platinum pieces times five  sam times five  matt times ten  liam times ten /none/ even better  matt the remaining sum for the agreement you had made was 6250 gold pieces for both jobs being  completed he had paid some in advance and given you some funds but this is the rest of the agreed upon amount  liam hundred silver yall  sam i think your math is off  matt he then reaches back into a small belt pouch that is carefully hidden on the inside of his  belt counts out a few coins and throws them across the table towards you it looks to be  another 50 or /none/ so platinum  marisha we got a tip  sam what is this a tip  matt for your loss and your troubles  sam that is very honorable  matt im nothing if not so you have a new companion that youve dragged into my sanctum  laura he has many gifts to offer  taliesin i have no idea whats going on right now  sam mr clay this is money and you can use it to by things like goods or services  taliesin what kind of goods and services  sam oh you know like tailoring /none/ services  liam what are you interested in  taliesin i know what money is im just having fun with nott  liam well but still what are you interested in  taliesin you know ive never really thought about it before yeah i can think of about four  things id like to get thats nice yeah  liam im sure they have a lot of tea blends here in zadash  taliesin well and i could probably use a new tea set and maybe a new skillet  liam you had three cups so you need counting  /none/ sam yeah so are the four things to make a set of seven  taliesin this ought to cover it just fine  laura you like rings  taliesin no im okay  laura whoa  matt well regardless you have two choices here either we kill you or we take a bit of your  essence to keep tabs  laura sorry about that  marisha yeah we probably shouldve told you that before we brought you in here  travis they all have a little collection of our blood in vials  matt its just a formality we /none/ need to protect our interests as much as yours i hope you  understand mr miss whatever youd like  taliesin clay mr clay  matt mr clay  taliesin im going to try and get an insight check on this interesting individual 23  sam ooh secrets  liam whispering secrets  sam hey laura  laura hey yeah sam  sam how do you like the new layout of the dd beyond app i dont think youve used it yet  laura no this is my first time looking at it but ill

you were  taliesin okay but im going to need something  matt chuckles curious tell me what /none/ you need  taliesin i need you to promise not to do anything untoward with it whatever youre going to do and  what you need it for obviously everyone seemed okay with that i need you to promise that youre  not going to cast anything weird or you know  matt you have my word as a gentleman  taliesin that seems fair  matt all right cree from around the corner finishing a meal the darkfurred yelloweyed  tabaxi woman begins to approach pulling a small satchel pulling open the flap  and taking out a small /none/ blade  taliesin i can do it im going to get one of my beetles to come out and bite my finger for me  matt oh how strange  taliesin thank you  matt she pulls one vial out of her satchel uncorking it as she curls a finger upward the  blood seems to lift in a slow arc out of the wound and drift dancing through the air and  then into the vial before its filled to about halfway the blood flow staunches and it  completes the vial to about three quarters she corks it /none/ and puts it back into the satchel  closing it thank you very much for your donation  taliesin youre welcome im going to really quickly cast eyes of the grave are there any  undead within 60 feet  matt interesting point no no undead within 60 feet  taliesin thank you  matt you feel a little more comfortable knowing that  taliesin just wanted to check  matt cree turns to you and goes i hate to bother but im happy to see you return i see  that lucien is not with you  sam oh /none/ yes  liam that is correct

cree would like to see him  its been so brief since weve been reunited  liam it didnt end well it seems doubtful but ja if we see him again rest assured  matt very well anyway it is good to see all of you welcome back the gentleman is pleased /none/ with  your success yes then turns around and shuffles her way back to where she was sitting  laura can i ask a question matthew  matt yes you may  laura do we know what day it is is it past quenpillar  matt its probably right on the cusp of quenpillar because that shift happened with the  harvest close festival if i recall ill doublecheck after the episode to be sure its  the right answer youre right on the cusp if not right now entering to that month  travis could i get the gentlemans /none/ attention and say this adventure has been thorough a name came  up in our travels and i was wondering if you may have heard of someone a marius lepual  sam and laura whispering furiously what are you doing  sam pigeon cooing  sam go on  matt

sam maybe just have some tea they might have tea do you have tea  matt then the barkeep whos the ragged middleaged man whos running the bar at the  moment one eye you dont know if its swollen shut or
