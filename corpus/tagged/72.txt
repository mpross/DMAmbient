critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back  laughing  matt welcome back last we left off the newly decidedupon title for this adventuring group was  announced to bryce and as such you are now referred to as the mighty nein  all nein  matt the mighty no in zemnian  travis and taliesin big nope  matt upon finishing your business in alfield you acquired your new cart /town/ new horses and found your  way on the amber road northward for a number of days making your way toward zadash along the  way you had some curious naps you found some cool little landmarks from a war long past you  were nearly robbed and instead shooed them off with cries of extreme syphilis and then entered  the gates of zadash yourselves upon which you briefly met a character named ulysses who  offered at a bit of cost to show you around town for the remainder of the day unfortunately the  sun set within /none/ the next couple of hours but you were led toward the pentamarket where you did a  little bit of shopping offloaded some things youd acquired in your previous venture in the  mines where you battled the gnolls encountered a purveyor of various magical artifacts named  enchanter pumat sol acquired some baked goods from the market and then finished up by making  your way to the leaky tap where you had just begun to cross the threshold when we left off last  week with that coming in out of the nowcold night air mouths filled with /tavern/ various crumbs and  residue of sweets having been consumed on the walk you enter the darkened interior of the leaky  tap now the leaky tap itself is a simple but very large tavern you can see theres space here  for at least a dozen tables and chairs and stools crowded around while it lacks decor it seems to  have charm with a rather rattylooking band in the corner thats playing mostly onkey it  appears that a number of people who have found their way this is the eastern outersteads i  believe have wandered in /tavern/ to spend whatever coppers they want to throw towards a drink to send  their cares away for the evening andor argue with each other about how better to make the day  before them upon stepping into the chamber you can see theres already about 25 patrons scattered  amongst the tables and the evening appears to be slowly crawling to more of a roar theres chatter  and whispers theres laughter and the clanks of metal and glass you can see already theres one  long bar on the far end of the room that is broken in /none/ the center for a number of entryway hatches  and two busied bartenders rushing back and forth what do you guys want to do  sam i sam riegel want to go back and see pumat sol again but that would not make narrative  sense  matt theres always tomorrow  marisha can i do a quick case of the room see if i see anybody suspicious  travis give them the old evil eye  matt make a perception check  travis come on first roll of the night  marisha perception check okay thats not too bad /town/ 15  matt 15 okay glancing about most of the patrons in here range from somewhat dusty  destitute clothing that looks to be torn and ragged at the edges some can be farm hands but  most of the farm work youve seen is done on the outskirts of the outer walls of zadash but youve  also walked through folks in the street that sit on the side peddling handcrafted wares and  whatever they can muster to try and make ends meet on the outskirts of the city proper you notice  two fairly dressed individuals compared /none/ to the rest that are in the process of doing a quick game  of cards you can see a large group of people that are just beginning to gather and keeping an eye  out towards the door if anybody else they recognize is going to come in looks to be about  eight or so strong with younger halfelf woman or so who as you guys enter sees you glances over  then shakes her head and goes back to conversation  sam bachelorette party  matt oh straight up you can see the whole banner on the /tavern/  marisha penis necklaces  travis dick whistle yeah  liam except this is dd so theyre real penises  marisha gnoll penises yeah  matt cast identify on that  liam ten gold a head  matt the attunement process is a little weird anyway  liam im at a bar thats the way it goes  matt you do see one of the barkeeps leaves behind and gives a finger off to the other one to pick up  the slack the one leaving looks to be an elven woman what would look to be the equivalent of /tavern/ a  human 40s or so so who knows how long her actual elven age is looks graceful looking a bit  disheveled hair pulled back and tied into a small haphazard bun simple apron washing up her hands  and toweling them off as she passes off the full bar to a male dragonborn whitescaled plump  physique he himself is wearing a similar apron with a big smile on his face he seems jolly  rushing back and forth taking orders filling drinks and looks like even though hes a bit  stressed at the moment having to /none/ take the slack is handling it with a smile and is used to the  usual evening ruckus  marisha and so the two the dragonborn and the female elven lady seem to be running the joint  matt they seem to be yeah  marisha copy that  travis i figure we want some drinks and food yeah  laura and also we should rent some rooms  marisha hey jester it looks like theres a game of cards going on over there  laura oh okay i will  marisha just tossing it out there  laura i /none/ will do that  marisha you dont have to take my  travis or you could eat first weve been traveling  laura im gone  liam i saw that you were eyeballing the room alles gut  marisha what  liam everything is good  marisha yeah its fine yeah seems like a room people in it  liam that is accurate  marisha yeah  travis sir can i bother you for a second  matt at that point and hand comes up and he goes excuse me just a moment fills up two  tankards on the /none/ side slides them down a bit grabs a couple silver pockets it comes back  travis hes busy  matt turns back to you and maybe a good solid inch or two taller than you a burlylooking  dragonborn  travis whistles  laura hes not that tall youre not grog anymore  travis whos that  matt with a dangerouslooking front of the snout that as soon as it spins to you and he looks at  you with this big toothy grin you can see scars in areas where its been split in the past this  guys /none/ seen some rough action in his past but as soon as the large dragon mouth curls up into this  smile the golden yellow eyes peeking from behind these stark white scales themselves look a bit  dusty  liam white scales  matt yes right so what can i do for you  travis yeah can we just grab any booth or table thats available were looking for some food and  drink this evening  matt oh food and drink i can go ahead and get started at least get the order in the kitchen  pick a /none/ table sit a spell rack up you paying up front or you like a tab  travis i think a tab yeah  taliesin a tab with a conversation of possible rooms for rent later  matt oh how many rooms you looking louder ill be right with you hold your shit yes  marisha how many rooms you got  matt looks under the counter real fast pulls out a small board  travis three rooms  matt oh we got plenty weve got like seven of them open three rooms and a tab under the  name  /tavern/ sam and taliesin nein  taliesin nein  sam just nein  taliesin nein will do  matt theres six of you  taliesin nien nein  matt oh zemnian fucking weird all right  liam it is one of the languages of the country  sam its a lovely language  marisha what was your name  matt me im wessek the trim  marisha wessek the trim  liam good name  sam we have the same middle name  matt purveyor of the bar here  taliesin is he in fact trim  matt no he is /tavern/ a plump dragonborn  taliesin just checking if it was an ironic nickname or not  matt he has lived a happy midlife im purveyor of drinks and keeper of food here at the leaky  tap happy to get your food orders in get some drinks to your table sit back relax theres  usually a show at some point in the night  laura im hopping over to the card game  sam im going to tag along beside her hey do i see any other goblins in this bar  matt make a perception check  sam /tavern/ two  matt no in fact from your height just a lot of bums  laura a lot of butts  matt a whole lot of butts in there  sam im going to assume that im okay then  travis any other halforcs in this bar  matt you do not see any halforcs in this bar as you go over to the table the two gentlemen who  are playing cards you sit down and glance one of them looks to be an older man in his 50s or so  his pattern baldness curling back but has /none/ this curled mush of brown now graying hair on the  outskirts of it hes wearing a billowing shirt of a nicer silk thats why it caught your eye these  two seem not extremely welloff by any means but at least better than a lot of the other riffraff  that are finding their way in including you guys  laura my dress is nice i dont know what youre talking about  matt your dress is pretty nice youre right thats true the other one is in the process of  heavily concentrating on his hand this one /none/ looks a lot younger he has this scraggly mustache it  looks like hes probably been growing it since childhood and has let it go in its glory he has  a buttonup high collar bit and a cravat that has loosened and fallen both of these gentlemen upon  a closer look look like theyre dressing up beyond their station and at the end of the night  have come to alleviate their stresses with drink and yelling at each other over cards  laura hop hop i sit down  matt yes  laura what are we playing /none/ are we playing go fish or war or  matt they both stop midconversation and glance over were playing whatever suits us at the  moment were in the midst   laura what is suiting you right now  matt well we are in the moment finishing a quick game of poker if you would be so kind as to  leave us to our game in peace that would be appreciated  laura i will play with you im not very good so you can take so much money from me  marisha yes grift it girl  /none/ matt make a deception check  taliesin i am watching this from the table this is the show  laura 17  matt 17 the younger one who was talking to you glances over to the older gentleman whos in the  process of glancing back and they take a moment and they both look back to you together i  suppose if you want to buy in then that is your choice  laura you can finish your game though ill just watch  matt they wordlessly continue the game they begin arguing over the process of rising prices /none/  between irons coming down from the druvenlode city which is one of the larger mining cities in  the empire they begin to also discuss the quality of alcohol seems to be diminishing the more they  drink eventually with one final hand the younger one slaps down his cards and the older  one in frustration goes fine you win  laura i applaud the younger guy what do you want to play nott do you want to play  sam ill just watch for now do you want me go get you a drink and bring it /none/ back or are you  okay  laura no unless you want to get some milk  sam ill just watch for now  laura okay what is the buyin  matt what do you wish to play  laura what do you wish to play  matt for the sake of ease of the sudden card game he looks around at the other guy do you  know the crickqueens call  laura i do i love it this is the one i was telling you about  sam you were  laura yeah remember with the three cards /none/  sam oh yes i remember  laura yes yes yes yes yes  matt very well then he goes to shuffle the cards rather rapidly before he begins dealing out  the early sets  taliesin is it a clean shuffle  matt you may make a perception check  laura i would watch that too are you watching this  taliesin nope i dont see shit  laura i would be watching this too because im kind of a  matt make a perception check  liam a question is there any rafters or any high place in /none/ the room behind these gentlemen  matt there are rafters yeah its not a very high peaked ceiling the actual roofing element of  this at least begins about twelve feet up and theres a small space before the beams meet the  top  liam for the moment i scootch frumpkin down to the floor and send him off towards behind these  gentlemen to hang around under that spot for the moment  matt all right  laura 22 perception  matt it seems to be a clean shuffle and a clean deal  laura do we put /none/ two gold in or some silver  matt both the guys look at each other again their eyes a little wide two gold would suffice  yes of course  laura okay  matt he strokes his waytoosoft mustache  travis notallthere mustache  liam nott i think youre too young to be watching this you should come sit with me over  here  sam its very fascinating though  liam no its a bad idea youre too little for gambling  laura youre not too little nott youre not  sam she doesnt think i am but if /none/ caleb says so then i should go with caleb good luck  liam use your skill  laura okay  marisha im confused is she actually that young or is that part of the game  liam come let us go sit over here  marisha is that part of the scam  liam i walked away from this one  matt two gold on the table from each of you so thats six gold in the full pot go ahead and make  your roll 3d6  sam ooh what do you do take the best two what do /none/ you do  laura no no no  matt everyone rolls and then you can raise your ante  laura wait im going to try to use one of my own cards and try to replace one of the cards  matt make a sleight of hand check  liam frumpkin climbs up into the rafters with a view of the gentlemans cards  laura 19  matt 19 okay  taliesin can i try to perceive this too  matt sure make a perception check  taliesin 18  matt no you do not they all look at their /none/ hands the younger one with the mustache keeps  stroking the front of his face and goes ill raise four you dont roll yet you have to raise  first  laura i thought i was trying to cheat and replace one of my things  matt oh you were yes youre right  laura do i get to choose what it is or do i roll again  matt you just roll again  laura okay i rolled it it was shit okay  matt he goes raising an additional two gold pieces  liam i would like to /none/ start looking at their cards through frumpkins eyes  laura im definitely raising two from your two im going to add in another three so five extra  on the table  liam quietly get ready to use your wire  sam okay im pulling out my thin bit of wire and im getting ready to cast message  travis we just cant have a fucking peaceful drink can we just got to get right into shit  okay  matt i know all right they meet your raise thats now 21 gold i believe on the table so  /none/ you all get to draw another card so reroll one more  the older one  sam folds  matt no he stays  laura okay the younger one  matt perception check  liam yeah thats a 21  matt 21 yeah you can see  laura ill cover my ears so i dont know  sam youre about to know when i whisper it to you  laura oh okay never mind  matt the younger one has a crap hand hes trying to bluff and hes already sweating a bit the  older one is looking really /none/ good  liam okay tell our friend that mr mustache is sitting pretty and the young boy has scheiße  matt well the mustache is the younger one the older one is  liam reverse that order please also i would like the curly fries  sam i point to her and whisper in my bit of copper wire and do a little hand gesture and say  all of that to her the young ones bluffing the old ones got a sick hand hes going to burn you  burn you good  laura hmm im going to sleight /none/ of hand and try and replace one of my cards  travis jesus in one game  matt all right so go attempt it again go and roll a deception or sorry sleight of hand  laura oh god  matt you guys are so honed in on this  laura oh 16  travis oh no  matt the young guy is sweating a bit and he gets more nervous he just continues to stroke his  little caterpillar mustache quicker and smaller bits the older guy who seems to be playing rather  spacey the whole time suddenly /none/ zooms in on your hands and goes i do say i think were being  had  laura what by who  matt he leans forward and pulls one of the cards that you had slipped into your sleeve out onto  the table  laura oh thats weird where did that come from i shouldnt wear such loose sleeves you guys  that was really obvious  matt the old guy stands up and leans forward you can see he has this bloodshot corners a little  bit where the white show for deep brown irises the smell of /none/ alcohol and dirt wafts off of him as  he leans forward i will not report you for cheating but we will taking the rest of the pot  laura wait cheating what are you talking about  matt he just takes the coins and scoops them up  laura wait i thought that was part of the game is it not  matt they get up and leave  laura motherfuckers they took my money  sam did you win  laura yes nott i won real good  sam i knew you would  laura i only lost /none/ seven gold that was a lot of fun you guys that was a good trick with the  messages  sam it didnt seem to help very much though  laura no but it would have if i had succeeded in these gosh i really need to get tighter sleeves  though  liam yeah but that one had potential  laura molly you have to teach me how to do that better okay  travis she wants to play again right now  laura what  travis what i said you want to play again dont you  laura /none/ laughing so bad  travis yeah lauras dying on the inside  laura yells  sam should we follow them outside and kill them  laura ooh no probably not  taliesin that doesnt seem very nice  liam why dont instead we have something to drink and eat  travis i agree with you 100  laura you know what else we should do  taliesin follow them outside and rob them  travis molly come on now  taliesin sorry  laura did we get rooms  taliesin we did get rooms  laura yay are we roommates /none/  marisha roomies  matt dinner arrives drinks have been provided you guys are able to use your meal and figure out  who you want to talk to what you want to do your business  laura we should look for claudia  sam we were told that there was claudia sheet here  laura sheed  sam sheed sheedy ally sheedy is here  marisha oh i love her  travis sheed or sheen  matt sheed  sam charlie sheen  liam only i get to say schiet you have to say sheed  sam shes probably /tavern/ the elven woman working at the bar since we were told she works here right  taliesin claudia sheed  laura yeah  taliesin claudia sheed  laura lets ask about  taliesin yelling claudia sheed  travis yeah go get her molly  matt as youre shouting this out some people start looking over curious as this very  ostentatiously dressed tiefling starts shouting essentially the owner of the tavern out in the  center of the tavern no one seems to make any physical action towards it however wessek points  over towards you oh she took some /none/ time off shes up in her office sorry  taliesin brilliant thank you  travis that was very effective  taliesin i normally find shouting peoples names really loudly tends to bring them to your table  travis right i wonder where her office is  laura we could ask  taliesin we could look have we had food and drink yet  matt yeah you guys have eaten and now youre in the process you dont have to roleplay every meal  various eating noises  travis nott has to roleplay every meal  liam what time of the /none/ evening do i know it to be  matt at this point its probably pushing close to ten oclock  liam ja okay  matt the suns been set for a couple hours  liam yeah thats late its not that late  travis anybody feel like going up and giving ole claudia a door rap at her office  liam i thought you were going somewhere else for a second  travis no  taliesin im interested either way so im going to stand up and start heading upstairs  marisha yeah im bored lets go  taliesin come /none/ unpleasant one lets go  marisha all right obnoxious one im with you  matt theres a brief spiral staircase towards the far back that leads to a landing and then the  second floor from the outside you could see  there were three floors to it so this probably  progresses theres another staircase further down the hallway from the landing up there  theres a single doorway that is currently closed it has no name on it but it stands alone from the  rest of it and it seems to be in the direction as to /town/ where wessek was pointing  taliesin im going to look for what looks like an  office for whatever door seems most inconvenient  matt at a quick glance the one on the landing  taliesin the one on the landing it is  taliesin and marisha click and knock the same pattern  sam what the fuck was that  travis wow yall  matt weve been hanging out far too long this is a problem theres a moment yes who is it  taliesin friends from out of town  matt more information please  taliesin bryce sent /tavern/ us  matt bryce who  laura bryce from alfield  sam youre not there  laura yes i am we went up there i thought  marisha crownsguard bryce  taliesin from alfield  matt all right just a moment please about 30 or so seconds pass and the door opens and the same  elven woman you saw leave from behind the bar earlier however the disheveled appearance you saw  earlier is gone is pristine clean and the hair is immaculately combed and pulled up into a high  bun wearing a deep maroon almost a silk /dung/ robe that is pulled over arms across  laura i was desanitizing him  matt oh fair enough so you are friends of bryce  taliesin we have come from very far to take a look  marisha converse  taliesin converse  marisha right  matt well they are a very good friend and if you are friends of them then you are friends of  mine i ask you to enter for the time being and perhaps we can get to know each other i suppose  if you have business enter please she turns and whips around /none/ and heads back inside this office is  a simple office when you consider most of the offices youve encountered have been in some level of  empire clerical work andor in various institutions this is mainly just a desk with a  chair some books and ledger information some scattered papers ink and quill a few books on  the side other than that its pretty barren and simple there is a window in the back that has a  crossbeam bisecting it into four squares it is just pitch black outside cause the rest of it is just /town/  an alley below anyway she turns around and sits in the chair and comes back and crosses her hands  in front of her with her elbows on the edge of the table all right you have my attention what can  i do for you  taliesin well to wrap it up a bit weve just recently got into town were looking for  employment odd jobs we were recommended to you to be the person to talk to about what actually is  going on in this city were new to this city we dont necessarily have /tavern/ our thumb on the pulse of  whats going on  matt you are here looking for work well for one if you are in need of paying work i always  have dishes to wash but at a quick glance at how you are presented as a little more capable  individuals at first glance i would say that perhaps you have other skills so i would  marisha i do the dude at a bar thing and push up my biceps  travis it works  matt if you are better with a blade or information then checking /none/ at the kings hall board  might be a solid bet for you  taliesin we just figured we would make sure that you were aware we were here we dont want to  ruffle any feathers and we dont necessarily know who are the right people the wrong people to work for  matt every person you meet is the right and the wrong person depending on where you are coming from  taliesin thats very fair  matt i guess i would ask what for you is the wrong type of people  laura shitty people  travis /none/ yeah wed like to avoid entanglements with the law being so new and all  matt right then perhaps do not punch any crownsguard and i think youll be okay  taliesin sounds easy except its really not  marisha it does seem like crownsguard tend to be assholes  talisin deeply punchable  marisha have you ever had any issues with the crownsguard weve heard rumors  matt i mean individuals yes theres a brief moment where she looks wistfully into the  distance ive had my encounters not so much with crownsguard but with other figures  marisha /none/ do we need to kick someones ass for you  matt oh ive already made sure their ass has been thoroughly kicked  travis maybe it might be wise to ask any particular groups to avoid while were here  matt she crosses her arms for a second interesting point where are you from have you  always lived in the empire  laura no im from youre from port damali im from nicodranas  matt from the menagerie coast you are in for a treat of comparably colorful times but a probably  less jovial atmosphere in places you /none/ know about the religious control correct  travis were slightly aware  laura wait what  travis well they frown  taliesin grace of the platinum dragon  matt there are for well over a century now the worship of various deities in the empire has been  controlled there are shrines throughout the city most cities contain a shrine of some kind to the  approved worships i just want to ensure that if you do not fall into this realm you do not go  flashing it about because that will get you very easily put into the /dung/ umber dungeon and that is not  a place you want to be  laura where are these shrines that you are talking about  matt they are scattered about for instance there is the allhammer their shrine is let me  think for a second as i consult my notes  travis yeah getting the good shit right now  marisha the umber dungeon  matt the umber dungeon there is the hearth of the allhammer that is existing in the pentamarket  laura ooh we were just there  matt look for the domed iron structure it may /none/ be a bit rusty not in the best upkeep its hard  to miss the interior with the very heavy beautiful anvil for both craftwork of those that  maintain a position what else do you want to know about it there is the ravens den which  is in the center of the graveyard  laura that sounds good too  matt the ossuary gates is the multilayered catacomb graveyard the ravens den exists in the  center area of that field  laura do the shrines usually have a lot of people in them  matt midday and /none/ depending on which places of worship they are yes but there are heralds that  run each shrine they work for the empire they hold all sermons they give council to anybody who  requires it its all pretty much within the government structure yes  travis are there any particular groups of people that are responsible for unsavory business in the  city any identifying clothing or memorabilia they might have on them  matt not visibly no there are many people that work underneath the law here but they are careful  enough if they wish to continue /none/ business to not show it i mean what are you looking for that  kind of work  travis no just perhaps to keep an eye out for in case we sought employment from the wrong type  marisha you know tourists we have that tourist look  taliesin speaking of tourist looks how much of a problem would this be in general  matt you should be fine its you should be fine  taliesin excellent  matt for the most part those of various unique heritages have harder times at the farther  eastern areas around the garrisons /none/ those that have to keep the creatures of xhorhas at bay and  possibly historians that believe that this is the curse of ghor dranas but you know for the most  part most nobody studies history and just consider you either uniquelooking or will avoid you regardless  marisha wait no one studies history really do you not have a good public school system or  something i was just curious  mat well if you want to go study history that would be over here in the interstead sprawl we  do have the apple tree tutor village /town/ that is three long buildings owned and provided by the  soltryce academy for basic learning to children and adults of the less affluent lifestyle for a  moderate price  marisha like private school  matt if youre looking for a comparison here it would be upperend public school if anything  liam charter school  marisha magnet programs  matt sure well put it at a charter school  liam lotteries are a bitch  matt but controlled by the soltryce academy  marisha all controlled by the soltryce  matt yes the head tutor there is an /none/ overworked and relatively stressedout individual  travis head tutor you said  matt yes mikael drom very nice fellow eager to help but the system has been difficult for him  taliesin is there a shrine to the dragon as well  matt there is there is a platinum house that would also be in the interstead sprawl look for  the beautiful white building with deep blue tapestries on the outside theyre reflective  mirrorlike during the day its almost a beacon for having to shield your eyes meditation  worship is all available within there sermons usually around /none/ noon  marisha you mentioned all the sanctioned shrines are there any unsanctioned shrines  matt anything that isnt the platinum dragon the raven queen allhammer dawnfather lawbearer  and the knowing mistress  marisha so six thats it  matt there are six  marisha six approved gods  laura all of those guys of course we knew about those guys  travis jester now that doesnt seem to cover who youre looking for though  laura oh well you know  matt i dont judge if you worship what you want you can just be careful about it /none/  laura okay  matt dont tell anyone  taliesin ixnay on the angersstray  laura okay i wont tell anyone  matt very well  sam shes going to tell everyone  matt thats going to help you anything else you want to know ive been living here most of my life  travis job postings anywhere we might go to  laura well we have the kings hall board yo thats where the job postings are  matt kings hall is a good resource if youre really hit up hard and you want to try the route  /none/ that bryce did you can always sign up to become a member of the military  taliesin eh  laura go fuck yourself no  matt it works well for some people it pays you are trained the righteous brand is very helpful  and helps keep the empire safe from the terrors that wander in and beyond the borders  taliesin were also always big fans of underbellies especially if theres an underbelly  with a heart of gold  laura especially one if its furry and you can pet it  matt there are plenty of underbellies but /tavern/ they are localized scattered and very protective  keep your ears open ask the right questions  taliesin are there names that if we hear we should trust  matt i dont trust anybody thats how im still alive and thats how i came to own this tavern  marisha great corner office by the way you have a window  matt thank you  marisha thats great  matt i had to change it a bit the man i took it all from i wanted him to leave nothing behind  laura was he perchance named the gentleman  /none/ matt theres a quick glance in your direction her expression darkens and she goes no but i  would be very careful how you use that name  laura oh shit  marisha really now  laura do you know him  matt i do not know him but i know of him that thing i said about trying not to get in trouble  with the darker elements of the city that might be in over your head that is very specifically one  who wallows in that mire  laura okay  marisha he wallows in the underbelly /tavern/ shit thats what you said thats me asking the dm  matt yes basically wallows in the mire of the underbelly shit sounds like a fun lyric  singing wallows in the mire of the underbelly shit  laura thats the second verse  travis well thank you for your time i think well find our way back down to the belly of this tavern  matt very well i will walk you down  liam sorry  matt yes  liam i want to touch on something happening im not there were not there  matt oh right  /none/ liam so i want to touch on something thats happening at the same time but i will wait until  you think its a good moment  matt sure you can do it now while theyre exiting the office while theyve been in there  liam yeah nott and caleb didnt go up theyre busy would you like to learn something interesting  sam a magic trick  liam sort of  sam yes  liam its a little homework and a little bit magic trick this is where i keep my spells this  is my book and this /none/ is the piece of luck that you helped me achieve in trostenwald over the months  and years i gather the amount of magic tricks that i can do so in this book for instance there is  a new spell that i do not even know how to use myself where i can make an invisible helper what  is going to happen now i bought supplies for it i find a booth for us in the corner is i am  going to move it from here into here and i thought you could help me would you /none/ like to do that  sam yes  liam okay so you can see  sam photocopying  travis xerox  liam i dont know what that means but this will take a little while here hold this i hand a  quill to her hold that you can see the markings on this page its intricate but you can do the  first few strokes it needs to look like that it needs to go here i guide her hand a little bit to  make sure that it doesnt smudge too much its still workable good now i /none/ will fill in the  details i spend the next they are probably gone for 15 minutes putting down the glyphs and  the markings  sam its delightful  liam and begin the first 30 minutes of the two hours i need to spend copying this  sam too much ill need to be plied with many drinks  liam oh yeah sliding them over  sam hows my penmanship  matt so far so good well see how it progresses as you guys exit the office at the  bottom of the stair you can see that group /none/ that was gathering earlier with the young girl that was  looking out towards the entryway is there waiting at the base of the stair  marisha the bachelorette party  matt yeah the bachelorette party if you will  though it was a mixed group as soon as you exit with claudia they notice her notice  you and all step back for a moment and wait as you step down the stairs a young halfelf girl  freckled auburn hair a smudged face of a hard days work leans forward and goes terribly  sorry claudia are we /tavern/ good to use the cellar for the meeting yes of course it is available to  you right now not a problem she goes all right thank you very much she turns around and  begins gathering up the crew you can see a few people at the bar shes slowly gathering the folk  until theres a cluster of about 20 or so they all begin making their way towards where the  kitchen is into a pantry area  laura are they going to have an orgy  matt youre going to have to follow to find out /none/  laura im asking that of claudia  matt oh  sam out loud  matt she goes no not so much they are passionate political debaters  laura oh  marisha are you helping run some underground clubs  travis just right out in the open huh  marisha in your cellar  matt no i am merely providing a space for people that are wanting to work through some  difficulties they have with their lifestyle that is all  laura im running to find caleb  liam its like latticework you have to do the smaller circle /none/ inside the larger  sam you have to do this with every spell  liam each ones a little bit different  taliesin whispering caleb  sam were busy here  liam were really right in the middle of something  taliesin thats all right we just need your cat  marisha i trail with fjord i want to know  travis as were heading down i lean over to beau  liam frumpkin climbs up mollys back  taliesin im tossing frumpkin in the direction of that  liam what are you doing with my cat  taliesin in /none/ the basement  laura oh you have to look through his eyes  sam you wont be able to see anything  travis the two of us are going  liam go to the base look the circle goes inside the larger circle  sam what is the a e thats one letter  travis i lean over to beau and i say i dont know if youre aware of it but when you  compliment people it sounds like a fucking insult is that intentional  marisha what  travis it was just an observation like commenting on the /none/ office window youve gotta put  more smile  marisha oh but that was badass she had a cool fucking office i guess  travis it didnt quite sound that way  marisha oh no  travis yeah just something to put in your hat  liam you know maybe we pick this up later  marisha can i try it with you  travis yeah go for it  sam ive just mastered the f that looks like an s  marisha youre really attractive  travis yeah so lets start with maybe a little smile on the face /none/ thats always a good starting  point try again  marisha youre really attractive  travis oh man you look constipated  marisha is that worse somehow  travis you ever winked at anybody  marisha youre really attractive  travis well keep workshopping it  marisha no that still wasnt it fuck thank you at least thanks for telling me most people  would just be like youre a bitch and then would leave  travis ive been around you long enough that i can tell you were actually trying to be nice  marisha thanks man i think /none/ youre real nice too genuine i was being genuine  matt the two of you have wrapped up for the time being  laura i just wanted to borrow some parchment do you have any extra pieces of paper though  liam how much do you need for what  laura i dont know like 20 pieces  sam do you need to write a long letter  laura a really long one  liam ill give you two  laura i can make do with that yes thank you  liam i hand them over  taliesin i need /none/ to know what your cats seeing whats the cat seeing  liam hold on  sam okay ive got you  laura ive got you too  matt the cat whos been following fjord and beauregard you guys have been having this  conversation as you follow down to the cellar as you descend down the cellar stairs you can hear  conversation and a few voices passing they all get quiet as you step and descend past where the  ceiling of the basement reveals you the group of 20 folks are all gathered around with a central  /none/ podium on an elevated step or a box theyre all looking at you quiet the one whos standing on  the box is a human man probably in his early 60s or so shorter hair graying but a little unkempt  in the face hes got smaller spectacles at the edge of his nose and unshaved stubble against his  chin but hes dressed in a nice white shirt tucked in well and looks thin and wellmannered  he puts his hand up and goes hey there can we help you  liam theres a bunch of people staring at /none/ fjord and beauregard why are we doing this  taliesin oh for fucks sake  travis apologies we dont mean to intrude were new to this city we just heard that some higher  thinkers were going to be meeting down here we hoped we might be able to join you  marisha just looking for good conversation  taliesin theyre making asses of themselves arent they  matt everyone looks at each other theres an ornery dwarf fella who looks over to the guy in  the top and shakes his head the halfelven girl who was gathering the /town/ group gives a nudge toward  you with a smile and says we can at least ask he goes all right well step on up the crowd  separates a little bit as you guys approach im curious share with me briefly the joys the empire  has brought to your life  liam i think its like alcoholics anonymous or something  matt be honest  travis im afraid my list is not that long unfortunately  marisha were a bit skeptical were looking for support just like any other wayward souls in this  crazy town  travis /none/ we seek knowledge  marisha we want to be able to trust our empire but maybe we need some reassurance in one way or another  matt make a persuasion check with advantage with his help  marisha persuasion with advantage thats good i got a natural 18 with a plus one so 19 just  being real vague  matt you seem to be on the level we are a group called the knights of requital and we are  discussing methods of changing the current political unhappiness in the city of zadash and beyond  marisha see were /none/ not the only ones we felt like somethings been missing  travis tearing at our heart its an ache  matt very well i will continue with my talk if you dont mind  travis and marisha please yes  travis preach on  liam does that name mean anything to caleb  matt no looking around the room most of the folks in here look to be saltoftheearth folk of  the city a few folks look to be a little more wealthy lowertomiddle class if you were to give  any sort of comparison there and they all /town/ look like theyre a bit riled up the dwarf who had  eyed you up previously his eyes have these heavy bags under them hes got this scraggly unkempt  brown beard and very short almost buzzcut hair on top hes glaring at the two of you he steps  away from the crowd and keeps a very close eye the gentleman at the top first off to our new  conversationalists i am dolan thrym as many of you know her i once ran a very successful physician  practice here in the interstead sprawl one that my partner /none/ was the head physician well he was  unfortunately brought to an unearned level of shame and his practice ruined as well as our  industry by the house of sutan naught but a year ago we went from a comfortable living helping people  to a life of squalor and shame i know were not the only one as now the son of the house of  sutan ren sits at the top of that practice took all of our clients and squeezes them for all of  their worth and i for one am sick of it everybody /town/ else in the group goes grunt  marisha grunts  matt im sick of it and we cant sit back and let nothing be done about it now would you like  to take the floor ulog the dwarf who was watching you guys takes his doesnt leave you  for a moment before he steps over and the crowd separates and he steps up onto the small block  which at his height puts him about head level with most of the crowd as many of you know i was a  woodworker for many years carving wood did /town/ good carpentry my wife illiana is a good wife  about six months ago she was up late at night picking up food for the night for the two of  us in the pentamarket she was in the wrong place at the wrong time there were some street bandits  outside the trispires they stabbed someone who had run in ran clean into my wife just as the  crownsguard descended she got looped in with them thrown in jail i went and fought there  wasnt even a bit of a trial the highrictor sent her straight to /dung/ the umber dungeon sentenced her  20 years for this business its been six months now i cant even see her im sick of it and i  think its time we did something everyone in the crowd goes grunts  travis and marisha grunt  matt this continues one after another individuals start coming up and talking about  resharing stories for the newcomers things that have come up recently that frustrate them they  begin throwing things around like instability within the starostas capable hands to maintain a  political structure in a city this large they begin /none/ to talk on anger and frustration with the  lack of proper education for the masses keeping them unable to climb status and eke out of living  and thus are forced into the military to die out on the fields of xhorhas there have been  discussions about frustration dealing with the ever creeping power scale of whats called the  cerberus assembly and influence that stretches from rexxentrum into the city itself eventually  it begins to rise into many voices clamoring out in frustration and once again dolan the softer  gentleman at the beginning puts his /none/ hands up and steps back and goes i know i know i know  but were going to find a way i have friends that ive made people that were talking to and we  have hopefully a new beginning soon an opportunity where i think we can have a voice in  the politics here i hope to have more for you soon in the meantime try and keep your chin up  i know its hard now but i believe well have an opportunity soon thank you thank you to kara  who has been helping set these /none/ meetings up points over to the younger halfelf earlier and she nods  and a few hands clap and to our new members im sorry i didnt get your names  marisha beau  travis fjord  matt beau and fjord thank you for joining us tonight it goes without saying please if you  dont mind we prefer to keep these conversations personal for obvious reasons  marisha absolutely  matt if even the most misunderstood discontent leads to unfortunate circumstances  travis we understand thank you for sharing with us  marisha i know i for one have /tavern/ had my discontent with the empire so its good to hear were not alone  matt of course thats requital i appreciate your time rest well well meet soon dismissed  everyone begins to scatter and make their way back up to the tavern  travis we stay down  marisha yeah im going to wait behind wait to talk to dolan  travis yeah really appreciate what you said  marisha yeah thank you so much  matt yeah of course i understand that you arent from around here so dont feel that you  have to take too /none/ much of this to heart best we can do to try and keep spirits up i believe that  we can find a way to exact some change real soon  travis it struck a chord it mirrors a lot of what weve seen since weve been here do you meet  very often id love to come back  matt well were scheduled to meet here in the next two days or so were gearing up for a couple  of important events  marisha how often are the meetings that heated that seemed pretty intense  travis yeah /town/ personal emotional  matt it can vary anyway im sorry i really should be going  marisha where abouts in town do you live  matt oh i live outside of the apple tree tutors  marisha well probably be staying here the next few days  travis yeah well check in with what was her name  marisha its claudia  travis yeah well check in with claudia if theres any other meetings again appreciate you  being so open  matt appreciate you being respectful and close to your chest anyway he steps past the two of  /none/ you puts the rest of his jacket on and exits now its just the two of you there in the cellar below  travis whats in the cellar  sam you going to rob the place there  travis i just want to know is it munitions is it meat is it booze  marisha wine is there good wine  matt there are large casks large wooden barrels and casks this is where major ale storage is set  but none of them are tapped it looks to be full of crates that are still sealed unopened  marisha /none/ any good wines that i would recognize  matt none of the wines are kept in this cellar  marisha okay  matt by the size of the place you get the sense theres probably more than one storage place here  liam when you scroll your cursor over it though the descriptions are all in red  marisha sure cant access that  travis talk about an underbelly that was more than i was expecting  marisha yeah and i totally called claudia on it too and she didnt even come forward im like  youre running some shit /none/ shes running some shit  travis right upfront  marisha did you notice he said thanks for keeping things close to your chest are we that transparent  travis no i mean i would say the same thing if i was taking such a chance with people i didnt  know right i think hes just trying to invest in us a little  marisha right  travis seemed nice  liam i tell frumpkin to yowl between their legs  matt meowing  marisha yells  travis suppressing a sneeze  marisha i give frumpkin the finger hoping caleb /tavern/ will see  liam i dont see it im not looking through it  marisha now im just flicking off a cat  taliesin you gave us the basics though  liam yeah  travis lets go back up fuck it  laura i was spending my time cutting the parchment up into even little rectangles so i  could make them into multiple pieces of paper  matt easy enough to do  marisha we go back  matt as you guys head up into the tavern to meet up with the rest of your troop you see theyre /none/ all  sitting around handling their other business what are you guys up to  taliesin we were listening to the description of this insanity  liam i bamfed out of that probably two minutes before it finished so i didnt get the tail end  but i got the meat  matt you got the meat of it you watched the people that were in the meeting leave in small  groups theyre pacing their exits  travis jester dont believe what you hear it was a huge orgy just naked parts everywhere  laura i figured it was /none/ and caleb was lying to us the whole time  travis i know maple syrup they had little tic tacs and all sorts of chocolate chips lollipops galore  laura usually in orgies like that they dont let you stay unless tongue clicking youre part of it  liam hes not sticky with maple syrup hes lying  travis tongue bath  laura eww nice  sam i think what we should do is take the names and descriptions of all of those people and turn  them in to the authorities for 50 gold a person we could make /town/ so much money and be heroes in this  town as well just like we were in the last  liam maybe not that but quite frankly those people are reckless telling you what they told you  travis yeah it is the only problem with that would be we were in that meeting at well  sam as spies  taliesin except that they told them their real names and where theyre staying  liam the authorities dont delineate between the real mccoy and the passersby just like that mans  story the dwarf  taliesin groups of people /none/ are always idiots never trust a group of people i specifically used  to gather people into groups to make them into idiots its just what you do you dont  laura so you did that to us  taliesin that is exactly what i did its how i met you its why i keep you around  marisha you also traveled with a group of people  taliesin yes but we werent a group of people we all hated each other  travis its a smaller group  laura its a pretty big group theres nine of us  /none/ marisha do you notice how often his logic falls apart  taliesin you just told them your real name  marisha no i told them im beau  sam you left out the regard part and you mispronounced your name ford when we all know  its fjord  travis thats right yeah  sam clever  marisha yeah theres a lot of people named beau right  laura are there ive only met one other person named beau  taliesin ive literally only met one other person named beau  travis its a good nickname beau beauregard  laura /none/ i think his name was not the same beau as your beau  taliesin it was a different beau  laura it was a different beau im going to start folding my little pieces of paper into little trifolds  matt all righty what else are you guys doing  travis i think were probably good to retire  liam im going to turn in i have a little bit more homework to do before the end of the night  good night thank you good night  taliesin im eventually falling asleep but before that im going to go /none/ take a fucking bath  there is a bathhouse im going there anyone who wants to come with me is welcome to do so  laura aww i want a bath so bad but its so late molly  taliesin its just a walk  laura is it even going to be open at night  taliesin is it going to be open at night  matt you can go and try and find out  taliesin im going to go and try and find out  im going to and try and find out  laura okay i have /none/ important work to do  sam ill accompany you just to make sure you dont get killed  laura ill come with you too because i really want a bath  marisha i guess i stay behind with fjord we talk about the crazy shit we just heard  travis yeah because were fucking spies  marisha fuck yeah man well break the system put it in the ground  laura its folded like this  travis and marisha fuck the man  matt all righty  taliesin im just happy with my company  matt right now the two /none/ of you make an investigation check  taliesin three  matt thats right shes coming as well  laura oh thats really bad its because im folding paper  sam 17 im specifically looking for stores  taliesin 15  laura four  matt you do manage to discover the location of the steams respite but it is closed for the  night it is too late for its functionality  laura damn it  sam on the way do we pass packwearers provisions or any of the other fine establishments  youve told us about  matt if you /none/ wander through the pentamarket which you can go roundabout to do that  taliesin thats not on the way then  sam no just on the way  matt on the way from where you are exiting there none of those no the pentamarket is pretty much  this cluster at the center of  sam any shops at all or is it just  matt you wouldve come across more small food establishments like small dumpling establishments  nothing too crazy it looks like most of the stores that are on the outskirts would be simple  glassware the /none/ occasional basic blacksmiths for putting horseshoes on and the construction of  that simple armor repairs for whoever needs it  sam nothing fun  matt nothing crazy most of the good stuff is in the vicinity youve already been  taliesin you know nott i notice i notice the way that you eye things on occasion  sam im not stealing anything right now  taliesin not right now and thats fine and i would hate to get in the way of any of your  business your business is your business and im perfectly fine with that but /none/ its good to  remember that there are people who need what they have there are people who need every bit of what  they have and there are people who would be much happier if they had a little less  sam how do i know which is which  taliesin well thats a skill worth developing thats a skill very much worth developing  laura if the people look like you and caleb they probably need it  taliesin if they seem grumpy or angry and seem overly concerned with an enormous amount of money  that they /none/ happen to have or using it to just be mean or cruel to somebody thats probably a sign  that theyd just be much happier if they just knew exactly who liked them and the only way you could  ever really know if someone likes you is if you dont have anything over them and the easiest way  to get to that honesty is if you dont have anything  sam so youre saying steal from grumpy people  taliesin oh yes  laura shitty people specifically  taliesin unless theyre grumpy because they dont have enough because /none/ if youre hungry you get  very angry  laura i do i do get really mad  taliesin you get so angry when youre hungry  laura i know  sam which kind of grumpy is beau  taliesin beau has way too much so you should probably take some stuff from beau thats fair  laughter  beau really needs to know who likes her  travis beau knows grumpy  laughter  laura oh no it makes sense when youre in that shirt  matt it makes sense when youre over 30  laughter  travis passive /none/ sports marketing campaign check  matt all right so you guys find your way back what about the rest of you guys anything  liam i am just finishing up the spell unseen servant before i go to bed so that i will know it  in the morning  matt easily enough you have it copied over without issue  liam yes yes  taliesin im so excited about a long rest  laura before i go to sleep im going to use my little folded papers and make little pamphlets to  the traveler so its going to /none/ be like have you heard of our lord and savior the traveler  taliesin youre going to get us killed  laura he sure is the coolest everyone should worship him hes the best guy around  taliesin youre making tijuana bibles youre making tijuana bibles for your religion is there  going to be nudity and sex in these because then its basically a tijuana bible dont google  tijuana bible  laura theyre like this little because i had to make them out of only two sheets of  matt how many did you make  laura well /tavern/ however many i could make out of two sheets of parchment so probably like eight or  maybe ten  matt well say ten and a few that didnt quite you got halfway through and like frustrated  noise tore it up okay cool so the rest of you guys are you all resting for the evening  travis mmhmm  matt all right night rest comes without issue you awake in the morning to the sound of an  already muttering tavern floor below you the smell of food and whatever dried ale has been  spilled into the /none/ room that youre currently sleeping in but the day is yours the morning has  arrived you are welcome to do what you wish  travis molly do you need to pray over your swords i dont know how often  taliesin oh i did it

liam oh good okay the first place though could you point me in the direction of it from here  matt right that would be lets see right around hmm singsong let me make sure i get  this correct for internal consistency ah that would be in the interstead sprawl if you consider  the citys triangular shape theres /none/ the pentagram market offcenter and a little bit to the west of  it and then theres the east and west outersteads which are the outside cusp and the  slums and the outside of the main wall theres the trispire which is up north then theres a  section a quadrant over here its a military section in this weird ring that surrounds and  bisects them all around the pentamarket thats the interstead sprawl  travis thats the garrison area  matt yeah well no thats the more middleclass central connecting part that holds  the rest of /tavern/ the city together  travis gotcha garrisons more east you said  liam library is there  matt the library is there  liam and its to the east you were saying  matt from where you are now you guys are in the eastern outersteads it would be west and he  goes actually ugh hold on just a second ill get to your meal follow me he comes out from  behind the bar and slaps it up and puts an arm around your shoulder and leads you right  immediately outside to the front of the tavern /none/ pushing you along  liam ja okay i shrink inward  matt he goes you look over that rooftop there and you can see that  and you see this slowly  tapering tower that then curves off at the very top to be a very domelike pinnacle the stonework  itself appears to be like a smooth concrete looking texture just from this distance and the  way the morning sun is hitting it half of it is just bright and reflective and really intricate  carving and various tiers along the towers he goes that theres the archive /none/ thats what  youre looking for so just look at that tower and keep going  liam thank you  matt no worries  liam also asking the dm

the pentamarket you said  youre going to the blacksmith  marisha yeah to the spark hammer smithing  /town/ laughter  marisha that worked real well  matt yeah it did  liam she is the grumpy one pencil in the dms neck  matt as youre making your way there one thing that you do you hear a voice thats loudly  talking that crosses you guys as youre walking down the street you can see a younger man in his  early 20s or so he has really thin blondish hair and hes wearing a tabard that is the same  colors as the crownsguard but other than that normal clothing  laura whats a tabard  /town/ matt a tabard is a piece of cloth that goes over the front and back  laura okay  marisha like when you see like knights  liam its like medieval times  marisha yeah im going for the green knight that  matt hes shouting out you get very quick instance hes a town crier as you come into  zadash you can see this is probably how a lot of news is disseminated amongst the populace here  marisha ooh whats he saying  matt what you hear approaching is shouting  a crownsguard and the kings grace /town/ attack on  alfield is ended terrible fiends responsible put to the sword by a crownsguard and the kings grace  sam hey we did that that was us  matt the attack on alf he repeats it as he continues down the street  laura aw man  sam they stole our thunder  taliesin but not our gold  sam and laura thats true  taliesin thank you  travis although i mean credit would help our you know reputation  laura yeah we could be famous  taliesin why would you want to be famous  marisha /none/ what do you expect from the crownsguard though  laura have you ever been famous  taliesin no i have no interest in becoming it thank you very much  laura you have no idea the kind of stuff that is given to you when youre famous  taliesin i have most everything i need already why would i need more stuff  travis jester any interest in chasing down that guy and seeing where the news is gathered maybe  they could print a retraction  laura want me to go tell him hes got it wrong  travis /none/ or where it comes from  laura okay i chase after him  taliesin no  marisha hes going to think youre crazy  liam also im sorry some of you wish to be in the spotlight with the things that we do  laura i chased after him already  matt okay hes moved onto it looks like hes cycling through different pieces of news and as  you approach hes shouting families missing in nogvurot crick kidnappers steal them away in the  night lock and seal your windows and doors while you slumber the attack on alfield /town/ has ended  terrible and you approach him at that point  laura excuse me town crier man  matt yeah  laura where does your news come from  matt from my boss  laura where is your boss located  matt its the kings hall  laura because your boss at the kings hall has some of his news his news is wrong did you  know that the attack on alfield was defeated by a group called the mighty nein theyre this really  amazing band of heroes  matt i was not aware i did not /town/ know  laura yes  matt thats really interesting  laura yes it is its really cool because we were there and we saw it happen and it was really  cool and you should probably get your news right  matt that sounds amazing you should go tell that to the herald of the hall hes probably the  one who would care the most  laura okay because by the time though that we get there and then it gets back to you youve  probably been around town so much and then youll have to retract your /none/ article and that would be  really weird  matt shouting the attack on alfield and he quickly gets away from you repeating the process  over and over again  liam also fjord walks right up behind jester and says deeper voice come on we need to get back  with the others okay this is not a good idea to put yourself out in the open lets go  laura fjord  liam deeper voice yes its me im fjord come on  laura what is this is this a new accent youre

doing  taliesin i prefer to keep it on the downlow personally  travis yeah of course not to alarm you i only meant that if we are going to be paid for our  escapades a reputation anonymously might help if we belong to that name  marisha you want an anonymous reputation  laura oh my gosh this is perfect because /none/ if were called the mighty nein people will expect  it to be a different group of people  sam because were just six  laura yeah thats actually brilliant  sam were disguised were hiding in plain sight  matt as you say that across the way you can see theres one crotchetylooking dude with one eye  whos like  taliesin im going to look right back at him  matt averts his gaze and keeps on walking  taliesin do i have something in my teeth  marisha plus what makes you assume were about anything right /none/ now i dont think weve made any  decisions i thought we were just having fun right making good money  taliesin im here for making money  marisha are we about anything  travis no  marisha yeah do you want to be about something  liam i dont want to be about making a stink everywhere we go  taliesin this is what happens after you go to meetings is suddenly you want to be about  something be careful  travis thats not true caleb im sorry  marisha i didnt say it he did  travis /none/ if we put you at unease that was not our intention  liam its not just me you are vomiting salt water and you are getting into fistfights with  people i dont know what youre doing and you look at you  marisha wait wait wait  travis look at you is always the worst look at you  taliesin im well aware this is entirely for the sake of my mirror im very well aware  marisha were the ones that you dont know whats going on with you two take off every day  the two of /none/ you

bad about that  taliesin i have a plan for this /none/ i have a plan were going to take our scrap and were going to  sell it so that we have some money were going to take the good feelings from that money and  were going to spend it on hot water and inappropriate friendly nudity  laura yeah  taliesin and were going to have a discussion about what were doing with heat steam water  and a little bit of cash  marisha okay youre super insistent about this so im going to go with it  travis yeah im down for it too  marisha because /none/ now i feel like its real important to you  taliesin i just find its easier to have this conversation when everyone is sitting around naked  in hot water  travis molly i expect you to lead this escapade please lead on  marisha sherpa us to our first bathhouse experience  taliesin i take five steps and then i go i dont know where the blacksmith is  laura ill lead the way  travis five steps in a circle  liam as everybody walks to beau i say listen its just about logistics i mean you are /none/ very  travis do you still look like me  liam no i dropped it you are in peak physical condition your guns are amazing i cant do  what you do i cant run into it of course im 100 yards back because im thin as a wet toilet paper  marisha thanks man thanks  laura thin as a wet toilet paper  marisha im sorry were you trying to tell me about im sorry what yeah yeah yeah  liam ive got to stop complimenting you it does not lead to good moments i walk away  /none/ marisha okay wait damn it first time liams walked away from me in the campaign  matt following jester you make your way back to the pentamarket to the outside of the spark  hammer smithing what was previously closed the night before you can now see the open air smithy  is lively and banging you can hear the slamming of hammer on metal and the shower of sparks from  the exterior anvil setup currently out there is a halfling man with deeply tanned red skin short  black hair and very muscular arms who currently has leather /none/ gloves on leather apron and is in  the process of forging some kind of long metal blade hammering it out over a heavy anvil on the  outside there is the trough for the quenching of the blade and then in the interior you can see a  few steps away the orange glow of the rest of the blacksmith interior there looks to be somebody  else on the inside but you dont get a view of them right now you can just barely get rows and  rows and racks of various pieces of armor and weapons /none/ that are currently hanging on display on  the inside there is nobody in the process of walking through at the moment just in the process  of crafting so you are the only individuals who are holding the space at the moment so the metal  clanging turn metal clanging  laura i take my pink bag and i put it down on the table in front of him  matt metal clanging hello  laura hi we have things to buy and sell from you  matt well im all certainly here for that what you got what /none/ you looking to buy  laura i pull out well it depends do you have a hand axe that i could buy  matt he sets the hammer into the water the steam rises up quenches the blade takes the gloves off  and wipes heavy sweat from the brow youre looking for a  laura hand axe something that is very sharp and can kill people  matt that i can do turns around to the inside of the building and comes back he has two hand  axes both look pretty well made one looks a little more /none/ intricate than the other but both are  pretty solid so we got these two throws one and catches it throws the other and catches it  laura okay put those on the table and then we will look at some other stuff first okay i have  six short swords and i put them down on the table ive got two daggers here ive got two  hand crossbows two light crossbows and two heavy crossbows  matt you place them all down and looking at the quality and the shininess and the smooth fresh  weaponry that hes /none/ placed on the table and the pockmarked used damaged in some cases gnoll  mess covered weaponry you immediately realize oh  laura maybe scrap metal is a good thing for this  matt i say so these have all seen some use not all that great sorry  laura but also also we have some other things  marisha there were then chains the manacles cart we definitely drug here definitely around  fjords neck  sam were selling these things  travis are they in the bag  laura i have them  marisha oh were they in /none/ the bag  laura we put everything in the bag then it would be good  matt you couldnt fit the manacles in the bag the one that was around the neck of the manticore  laura then we fucking had them around our necks  matt yeah you had them in the cart so you bring them along with you  laura we knew we were going to the blacksmith  matt well these here these are some nice metal  laura and they were magic  matt they were magic  marisha i show him the rune  /none/ laura they had to be real good metal to be magic  matt let me have a look at that he takes them pulls on the chains drags for a minute and he  inspects them over this some real nice craftsmanship you dont see something this well  made so where did you get this  laura this giant lion thing with a womans head had them around it and then we killed the lion  thing  sam we found it  matt did you guys bring the cart with you  taliesin well if we got there /none/ then yeah probably  matt he glances past you well the manticore head is still affixed to the cart by the way the  halfling looks past and he goes ill take it you mean that thing its quite scary well done ah  looking at all the weapons the woods mostly rotted unfortunately some of the metal can be  melted down and reused have to hammer out all of the imperfections smelt it all the manacles look  very nice tell you what give me the lot and the manacles ill give you both these axes and be /none/ in  excess of about 20 gold pieces  laura do we want both of the axes or just the one  sam why do we need any axes  laura i need another weapon just one of the axes is all i need i dont need both  matt put that at about 25 gold then and the one axe  laura sound good for you guys  taliesin works

probably got  flasks around there well they probably /tavern/ have some at the lodge of the eclipse thats possible  travis lodge of the eclipse  matt right right thats the more hoitytoity night time tavern here in the pentamarket  taliesin why is it called lodge of the eclipse  matt because at nighttime they has the great shows on stage  marisha you know anyone that might want a scary lion head thing to decorate their walls  laura specifically one thats melting  taliesin is there is a taxidermist is what i think shes asking  matt i dont know about a taxidermist unfortunately im pretty /tavern/ sure if you ask around  you can find someone willing to pay for that i probably ask the hall of erudition they deal in  weird things and strange beasties sorry about that  marisha what did you say the fancy tavern was  matt lodge of the eclipse  marisha lodge of the eclipse  liam we might be able to take it to a school or a medical facility to sell studies  laura yeah  travis im good  sam lets go  matt all right you guys head on towards where now  laura the /none/ bath  liam were in the pentagram penta  matt pentamarket  liam so were close to the library i thought it was in that area  matt no the library is the archive youre talking about its in the western side of the pentamarket  liam okay so were closer now then we were i dont see the entrance from where we are or do we  matt no its not one of the tallest towers in the city in fact the trispires as its called  has three massive towers of all different designs that lord over the /none/ rest of the city theyre the  first things you saw when you crested the hill on the way into the city the night before this one  is still visible from your perspective though its a little more squat and maybe four or five  stories tall  liam the whole kit and caboodle is visible from here  matt well you can see where the archive is but its maybe another ten minute walk to get there  liam okay does anyone mind if we swing by and just take a look at the archive not go in /none/ you  know we have other things were going to do but just to take a look  travis at the outside  marisha its a bit of a tourist trap but sure  liam you have seen it before  marisha yeah i lived here for like a short time passed through  liam okay how long did you do that  marisha a few months  liam okay well i am a tourist  marisha yeah its pretty  travis if its on the way sure  liam okay  taliesin is the board between here and there /none/ the job board  travis oh the postings yeah what was it  sam the kings hall  travis the kings hall where the herald of the hall is where we can get that retraction  matt the kings hall is actually not that far from the archive it would be a brief detour to  get there  taliesin we can do a couple to the archive couple to the kings hall just pick it up  travis yeah thats cool  liam would you like to show me the archive not the inside the outside  marisha i /none/ think its this direction if i remember  liam never mind i dont want to put you out anyone want to go see the archive  travis enthusiasm beau enthusiasm  marisha aww fuck  travis come on work on what we did come on  marisha i dont think caleb likes me  travis just try give it a whirl  marisha all right  sam it would be great if you could both take me  marisha all right hey caleb  liam yeah  marisha right this way  laura shes really scary  travis whispering yeah /town/  marisha is that fuck was that all right fuck  liam its just a volume thing sometimes okay lets go look  marisha louder he said enthusiasm  liam oh jeez  marisha was that not lets go this way  travis baby steps  matt all right so where are you heading first  liam the archive  matt the archive okay on the way another town crier crosses by another individual same garb a  middle aged woman hair pulled back into a very tight bun with the tufts of curled hair around the  edges same /town/ tabard in the front and shes shouting out riot in rexxentrum squashed for peace  radical groups brought to justice under the crown  marisha ooh  travis oh shit  marisha ooh thats some dirty fucking shit  laura i follow behind her and yell town crier has toilet paper stuck to her shoe  laughter  matt in the middle of her next line two weeks to  liam so you do know what toilet paper is  matt two weeks time to the harvest close festival victory pit in the pentamarket entry  begins in four days /none/  laura wait what did she just say  marisha harvest festival  matt harvest close festival  marisha harvest close  matt harvest close its the end of the harvest  marisha its in two weeks  matt in two weeks  marisha in a fortnight  matt in the victory pit in the pentamarket entry begins in four days  marisha victory pit  laura we need to get a really big piece of vegetable  marisha yeah yeah big pumpkins  matt you eventually find your way to the outside of the archive where you had seen /none/ was the  tapering tower that had the dome with the polished sun reflection on one side the rest of  it you can see with the intricate carvings that happen with each bit of the spiral as it continues  downward you can see three specific smaller spires that from this perspective make it look  like i would say almost like a tie fighter on its side it has a series of smaller three spires  at the base and a central spire that is the mainstay of the library you can see theres a  double door /none/ at the base and a number of individuals dressed in deep grey robes with blue  sashes very gray and blue color scheme as you approach the outside of it you can see folks  entering in and out but as they enter and exit the facility they usually enter and exit under the  watch and being escorted by one of these individuals that seem to be members of the archive  liam okay  travis sure is pretty  liam i would just like to look around its in a square you say  matt its built off /town/ of one of the main roads that leads in the direction of where the kings hall  is so its not in a major square area but its off a large road  liam yeah well i am no super spy but i would like to just look at the area and see what i see  in the nature of security other than these obvious robed figures  matt all the windows that exist are at least eight feet off the floor and look to be a very  thick stained glass the only entrances you see are currently /none/ guarded by at least two members of  the archive and the dress of them actually is very close to the individual that helped in the trial  that you had in trostenwald who introduced himself as zeenoth the one who helped provide information  that eventually got you off the hook for that trial you can now see similarities in the color  scheme of their attire and the way that its worn its ceremonial it looks like it comes with a  ceremonial robe theyre all uniform to a certain extent with some being more intricate and longer /none/  with more jewelry and they seem to have a little more station  liam and you said everyone going in and out was being escorted by one of these individuals  matt escorted by one of these yes  liam if i see one or two people going in or out what do they look like  matt one of them you see appears to be a woman very well dressed looks to be a high collar a  buttoned up blouse of some kind a dress that just barely cuts off right where her ankles hit the  /none/ ground with very nice shoes looks to be a very well off humanoid woman a human  sam does she look grumpy  matt she looks stoic leaves with a very laughs  sam is she leaving or coming  matt leaving  sam i will follow her  matt okay the other one looks to be a man probably in his late 30s or so also human he has  a cluster of small pieces of parchment that are folded and wadded into his arm and hes leaving  like he just was either taking something out or just /none/ retrieving something  liam same fancy type  matt less fancy than her but still more well off than most of the other individuals that have  passed through  liam fancier than me  matt oh yeah  liam yeah okay thats a beautiful building theyre all wearing the same thing  marisha mmhmm  liam youve lived here for a few months what do you know about this place  marisha theres a lot of books in it and fancy people are super interested in it  liam obviously i am very interested in learning is it easy /none/ to gain admittance do

happening you are following this woman down  sam ill try to stay 25 feet /none/ behind her  matt make a stealth check  sam and laura ooh  sam 13 oh 15  matt okay no one immediately seems to pay mind and shes currently eyes on the prize heading in  some direction with earnest intent the escort of course that had helped her out of the archive  stays behind and reenters the building and she continues on her own but stays mainly on the main  streets doesnt go and duck into any alleyways very much for her own personal safety during the  day and staying out in the open /none/  sam does she have any bag purse visible necklace pockets anything pickable  matt there do appear to be two small pockets in the front waist part of the blouse and a small  satchel thats hanging off the right over the left shoulder off the right side of the body  liam do i have any chance in hell knowing where she went because i start looking around immediately  matt make a perception check  liam okay no thats

blouse or a satchel on her side  matt yeah  sam ill do the side satchel  matt go ahead and roll sleight of hand please  sam okay  travis laughing what is it  sam 11  matt okay  /town/ taliesin higher

and looks behind her looks back  sam i press up against the wall  matt glances around confused eyes one of the small pauper children thats off to the side  begging on the side of the road  all oh no  sam it was that one  matt scoffs and holds her chin up /none/ and then continues walking with a brisker pace  sam i follow at a brisker pace  matt make another stealth check please  sam stealth 22  laura ooh thats good  travis yeah killed the baby and false imprisonment for the kids  liam thats how the empire works  matt okay brisker pace but does not seemed to take notice of your tracking  sam ill get a little closer this time and try for one of the pockets this time  matt okay  laura oh my god  sam ooh 12  liam thats better /none/  matt theres a brief moment where youve watched the flap of the blouse open up and expand a bit as  the mage hand begins to reach in for what is within and then with a slight tug you watch as two  of the blouse buttons bounce off and just a bit of the brassiere shows and she closes her shirt real  fast and looks about again and turns and what you can see is a man there whos selling apples on a  small cart on the side is maybe two feet from her and goes /none/ miss with the apple and she smacks him  right in the face and he what was what how dare you  travis oh shit  matt then holding her shirt closed and bundles up her satchel up in her arms and is now beelining it  deeper into the city  travis dont let her get away with that  sam i run up to where that happened and pick up the two buttons  laughter  matt theyre nice buttons  sam i come back i did it i got these two things theyre very nice and round /none/ and shiny  liam theyre very nice where did they come from  sam a very grumpy person she was awful she scowled at children and slapped an innocent man  for no reason she was evil  liam insight check that is a 20  matt if you want to insight check her youve got to make a deception check  liam well maybe she believes it i dont know  sam i believe it she was a horrible person  liam yeah okay well  sam my itch has been scratched  taliesin i feel good about everything /none/ that just happened  laura in the time that nott was gone could i spot the allhammer temple just so i know where it is  matt make a perception check  taliesin or the platinum house  laura 12  matt unfortunately no the platinum house nor the hearth of the allhammer were noticed the hearth  of the allhammer is in the pentamarket on the northern side and you guys had cut through to get  directly to the vicinity of the bathhouse in the area you are now in the city you dont have any  sort /none/ of visual on the platinum house as you guys have gathered yourselves together and you make  your way towards the steams respite were going to take a

watching the front as general sentries there it is you do also at a  quick glance see a tenfoot by fivefoot large heavy piece of wooden board that is standing on  its own about four feet from the main entrance to the right it has a number of pieces of parchment  stuck to it are you guys continuing on head to the bath house what are you doing  marisha take a gander  taliesin weve got mr memory board here to scan the thing  liam yeah /none/ i just take a quick look at it  laura are there people watching the board right now  matt looks like theres one person scanning past in the process of reading and looking at things as  they go looks to be a person in basic leather armors probably a sellsword of some kind  laura as soon as he walks away is there anybody any guards looking at the board  matt not directly reading it but there are right now four that are within a 15foot  proximity of it  marisha thats a lot of guards /none/  laura thats a lot of guards at this one board  matt well the boards right at the front what is essentially the courthouse center of the entire city  travis are we all hanging back ill walk up with caleb  taliesin works for me  sam is there a place i can duck

softer howdy  matt as you approach the board which you can see has atop of it pressed into the wood the lettering  that say task board the heavy wooden board looks like in /none/ immediate view of it there are maybe  eight pieces of paper that are currently stapled to it with various rusted nails that have been  reused and they have been placed onto it or have been stuck in and then replaced into it theres  probably close to 45 or 50 other rusted nails that are stuck there and have been left that have  currently holding nothing to it you do see through a first glance both of you as you look  past them a lot of them are looking for general work helping construction some are /town/ looking for  people that want to help reinforce buildings that are crumbling there are some that are looking for  folks that can help shoo away parts of the outersteads that are encroaching upon the  farmlands on the outside of the wall you do see one that says seeking and paying for any  information on myriad activity in the city  travis oh shit cops  sam i dont know what that is okay  matt there is one that says reward for information on rebel gatherings and anticrown rhetoric  marisha ooh  matt theres one /none/ that says  sam lets do it  matt theres another that says proof of others worship of heretical gods paid in gold one that  says looking for work for the glory of our king bertrand

voloshin  liam voloshin  matt yeah voloshin  marisha its the guy the town crier said  sam personally i think that we should turn in those devious schemers and get all the gold we can  travis no look

out  liam yeah i also dont want to stick my neck out but anything that is a thumb in the eye of  the empire im all for  taliesin stitches get eh snitches get stitches stitches are just  sam and taliesin stitches  taliesin snitches get stitches wait  marisha stitches are just stitches  sam in the original zimean  laura it makes more sense  taliesin one of the few  travis i personally enjoyed

tinging  sam western flute trill  matt which is strange because the spit actually emerges from your sternum  laughing  matt as you progress you eventually find yourself to the outside of the steams /town/ respite  fairly simple looking building of deeply darkstained wood slats that are all vertical  against heavy loadbearing columns at each major corner but its fairly sizeable for its simple exterior  taliesin ive learned one thing in my travels always hit the bathhouse first every major town  travis good to know  liam finally a bath  matt you guys walk your way into the main chamber theres a couple benches to the right and  left of you theres some small planters that have lowlight plants being kept in the area to give a  fresher /none/ scent there is a small chair and a desk set up with a clerk an older female halforc  hunched but smiling with her hair gray thick hair braided up on the sides and pinned in the back  with a long spike of some kind with a lower jaw that extends with two visible tusks but a warm  smile amongst the rest of the nice flower dress that she wears as you approach she looks up from  the desk hello youve come to the respite i am miss rima are all of

you get undressed there is a doorway that leads open into a central common  hot spring bath that is dug out /tavern/ of the ground here it has a rock perimeter to it and the steam  immediately hits you it smells of herbs and soaps the water itself is somewhat cloudy and it  looks like theres maybe only four other people in there obscured by the steam at the edges of the  pool as miss rima leaves your presence you guys can finish disrobing and leaving your clothing  behind and enter the bathhouse  marisha i go in and im like that drunk person at the hot tub at the hotel hi how are you guys

come up out of the water jester and breathes you hair flaps back on the back of  your neck  /none/ laura hair like the little mermaid  matt your eyes focus and you see a familiar face in the water across from you leaning arms  akimbo against the rock with a thick hilt of a sword just resting apparently  travis in the hot tub  matt in the hot tub you see a familiar palelooking muscular woman with darker hair  that fades to light as there is yasha staring at you with a curious look  cheering  marisha fresh off the east coast  travis beast mode  matt scoot in a bit  ashley oh /none/ hi  all

also if were going to get him back we going to have to have an agreement about the fact  that while theres going to be a certain amount of advertising necessary for this kind of venture  there are many of us and i think its fair to say that want to keep things quiet as quiet as possible  travis i agree i am also not looking to attract any attention  matt clapping /none/ you hear this four series of quick snapping claps and you hear heat it up  you hear the voice of miss rima from within and you watch as two side doors open these small  troops of women and men come through with these pots of heated water and then dump them into the  bath to refresh the heat and then exit again and then close the doors behind them  taliesin bless you  liam oh its hot down there on the ears  marisha

mostworshipped gods /none/ in the menagerie coast for  people who travel in and out of the ports there overseas safe passage amongst bodies of water  contests of strength proving worth through action

of zadash as you approach the doorways  the /none/ guards pass but keep an eye very closely as you enter on the interior you can see there are  two round tables with curved benches that meet the sides of it and there you can see some of the  crownsguard in the process of talking to various civilians and taking notes theres conversation  about pardon me so  travis is there a desk or a clerk  matt you dont see a desk or a clerk but you do see the crownsguard that are currently at the  tables talking to these individuals and you see two /none/ other individual crownsguards that are  standing and

and rothschild  taliesin im going to juggle  matt after asking some questions and making your way around you eventually find the trispires  which is not too difficult to see once /none/ you know what youre looking for you see these three very  uniquelooking towers that ascend past a round wall that encases the interior of this elite  portion of the city as you approach the wall the outer walls you see are basic stonework and  masonry thick as they may be and used as from a defensive position these walls are made of solid  marble and look more decorative than designed to be a military buttress of any kind as you  approach you can see there are two entrances to it or at least youve been /none/ told there are two  the one thats nearest to you opens in the direction of the pentamarket and while the  portcullis is lifted you see there are two crownsguard there currently standing with spears  and shields at the ready a horsedrawn carriage clomps by you and makes its way inside you guys  approach and one of the guards steps forward can i help you please  laura yes we have business at the pillow trove  matt i dont think you do please shove off  laura oh well i have business at the pillow trove /none/  matt whats your business with the pillow trove  laura i have a package thats being delivered there what business do you have at the pillow trove  matt look your friend here looks like he just wandered out of the evening nip if anything so it  would be best  laura oh yes i hired him to protect me because you know im very fragile and delicate but if he  doesnt look well enough to be my guard youre welcome to walk me instead  matt they look at each other make a persuasion check  /none/ travis and marisha come on  exclamation of surprise  laura 22  taliesin that was impressive  matt look at each other look back at you all right ill walk you in briefly then ill get  back to my post you stay the fuck out of this  laura whispering sorry caleb ill let you know  what its like okay  marisha rejected  laura whispering frumpkin kitty kitty  matt all right to the pillow trove this way follow me the other guard steps past him and  blocks you from the other two as the /none/ guard guides you in he makes a big whistle sound does a finger  loop and you watch as another guard gets relieved and comes down to help him at the front doorway  laura you guys are really on top of your shit in here  matt thank you i appreciate that now stepping into the trispires  liam does that happen licketysplit the second guard comes down  matt theres maybe a 20 second period where hes making his way down you get the sense from the  look of this and glancing through the interior you see /town/ elements of beautiful courtyard parks with  trees and bushes you can see statuesque structures that decorate what normally was just  dirt road with occasional bits of stonework as beautifully laid cobblestone from the interior  you can see homesteads of different styles of construction from all across this continent and  beyond this is where the money in the city goes this is the district where the elite live where  the elite work and where folk of very specific visual presentation and purpose are allowed entry  liam right and as she goes and does her thing /none/ i just want you to know that frumpkin does follow  her and i leave and walk around the block and duck into an alley or any private place and cast  disguise self on myself to make myself look very resplendent  matt roll a stealth check for frumpkin  liam for frumpkin its not very good that is only a four  matt as frumpkin begins to meowing run on its way and one of the guards goes piss off and  kicks frumpkin about ten feet off and stumbles and skids and then gets back up  /none/ marisha no not okay  liam does that take any damage  matt id say take one point of damage  liam gone  laura no you said one point  liam i rolled hit points for him when i made him and it was one so hes gone  travis explosion  marisha you kicked his cat into oblivion  travis you kicked his cat until it burst  matt i didnt  travis he kicked his cat so hard  travis and laura he kicked the highlights out of his hair  liam whos laughing now billy whos /none/ laughing now  matt stray cats cant just wander into  liam caleb curses to himself and wanders around and does what he says suddenly looking very  noble ill let that go and then ill follow up  travis you guys i kicked this cat today and it fucking evaporated  laughter  taliesin if that isnt a beerworthy story i dont know what is  travis somebody punch me punching sound  liam caleb is pissed  matt the guard looks a bit confused as you wander back hes pointing at the tip of his boot  and /tavern/ hes like i dont know it was fucking crazy so what do you look like  liam i am wearing the deepest black robes and i have a black goatee very evil david hasselhoff  taliesin the master from doctor who  liam sure that  laura he looks very embroidered and everything  liam its all black velvet the way the audience thinks vax looks thats what i look like right now  sam kneel before zod  liam i have a meeting in 20 minutes at the pillow inn i dont know what its called but caleb  /none/ does i dont remember shit but caleb says whatever the name of it is because of my feat  taliesin this is the smartest feat youve ever taken  liam of course it is it was chosen very specifically i say whatever its called  matt the pillow trove  liam i dont remember he does i have a meeting in 20 minutes at the pillow grove i know thats  wrong right now 20 minutes i need to get in  matt they both blink their eyes at you as you glance down to look at your hand its /none/ your  regular sleeve  liam the spell didnt work here  matt it worked but then as you approached you looked down and its no longer there  gasping  marisha oh magic shit  matt you have a sense now you think back to the air of magical longevity the spell would maintain  its gone  liam oh wow  sam oh no  travis disguise self  liam yeah he used disguise self  laura so they dispelled it  liam we dont know  matt at some point as you approached and then walked up /none/ to the gate your disguise self just  dissipated the one guard that was there before is like  liam okay i just walk away  matt as you walk away he just goes yeah thats what i thought  liam cat kicker  matt quick meeting right quick fucking meeting  sam kill that guy  laura what a dick  marisha you just made some guards night  taliesin we got to kill that guard  travis yeah hes gone  matt you are escorted to the exterior of the pillow trove which would be over here in /town/ the trispires  marisha i wonder how much of the trispires is like this  travis its got to be locked up  marisha right  liam yeah its fancy pants  matt youre led down the beautiful cobblestone street around the bend of this beautiful  courtyard where you can see a family that is currently sitting down and having an openair  picnic here amongst the grass butterflies in the air its picturesque to the point where you  question how engineered it is to a certain degree with a couple of quick spins you see one that /none/  catches your eye which is really interesting this massive one of the trispire towers thats  closest to the vicinity of the pillow trove looks like it was this old temple thats been completely  hollowed out and repurposed to look like a glitzy casino there are banners that are pulled across  in brightlycolored silks that mingle and braid into each other you can see on each different  floor theres a different tone to the stone thats been slightly altered and you can see signs  showing different forms of entertainment its simultaneously historically aweinspiring and  /town/ gaudy combination that is intriguing  laura like caesars palace  matt kind of yeah its a little vegasy compared to the rest of this area you can see a  lot of the  marisha theres clouds painted on the ceiling for no reason  matt at the corners of these roads you can see these tall lanterns that contain a very faintly  everburning flame between each of them theres a long white silken banner that hangs as part of  decoration along each road the roads themselves feel like theyre always in some loose paradetype  celebration /town/ thats just part of the decor of the vicinity the stark contrast between the  outersteads to even the moderately average innersteads to the trispires is astronomical  laura can i ask the guard what is that building  matt have you not been here before  laura no im new to town actually  matt interesting youre in the silken terrace what youre looking at right there is called the  triumph chime its got all sorts of bars gambling halls inn rooms brothel everything you  need up here  laura oh wow i didnt think you had /tavern/ things like this in the empire  matt weve got them in places what you think were uncivilized folk where are you from  laura im from the menagerie coast actually nicodranas  matt huh well youll feel right at home yeah  laura quite  matt well here you are pillow trove as he motions over to the side you see this luxurious  inn that has this cylindrical appearance to the front and then turns into a blocky building  behind it has this gold and deep purple coloration to the pillars that hold up the various  /none/ walls to each intersection and as soon as you walk inside the scents of scented candles and  various lavendertype smells hit your nose the element of it reminds you of home as you walk  inside theres a beautiful semicircle desk and a human woman probably in her mid20s or so jet  black hair thats straight and dangles past her shoulders watches you approach as the guard  says ill wait here and escort you out when youre done  laura thank you very much kind sir i walk grandiosely up to the woman hello i have a /none/  package thats being delivered to here  matt very well what is the name receiving  laura jester  matt i shall inquire ill be back here in just a moment  laura thank you very much  matt as she leaves from the front desk you can see there are two crownsguard that are assigned to  the sides that are keeping a close watch on you but theyre lackadaisy through their day you  get the sense they probably dont have to work too hard this side of the city about five minutes pass  laura is /none/ anybody watching me  matt theyre both watching you but not intently like hawks more just making sure youre not doing  anything silly you watch as a rather bounding obese merchant in his late 40s or so comes  barreling down the stairway sniffling hard and rubbing his nose hes dressed really well maybe  a size too small trying to reclaim a presentation maybe of a younger self and he hasnt quite come  to terms with the fact that hes hitting that age as he walks past he goes ah good day  laura good day  /none/ matt he exits the building another five minutes pass and eventually the woman comes back and she  goes im sorry we dont have a package for that name here is there any other it might be under  laura maybe under lavorre  matt ill check  laura okay  matt she leaves again for another few minutes comes back after that im sorry theres nothing  under that name  laura anything from the ruby of the sea maybe  matt ill check one more time  laura okay thank you  matt she leaves  laura i /none/ smile back at the guard like pained laugh this is crazy isnt it  matt she comes back out im terribly sorry we do not have a package for or under any of those names  laura well thats really weird okay well tell you what how about because its probably going  to be coming you know im here really early for it you know so if it comes for me when it  does could you leave word with the guard outside the trispire  matt which one  laura the guard house you know  matt oh /none/ all right okay  laura then i can come and ask if its been delivered and then i can come because i dont  want to have to walk all the way here you know if its not here for me yet  matt very well ill make a note of it  laura okay unless i should maybe stay here waiting for it  matt if you like we could set you up with a room  laura oh yes how much would that be  matt well depends on the size we have our general suites we have /none/ the lordly suites and  then we have the diplomatic invitational suites pricing begins at ten gold per room for the basic  suites 20 for the next tier up and for the diplomatic ones those run about 50 gold a night  laura well i normally stay in the diplomatic rooms but i guess the smallest room because you  know im small  matt of course ten gold per night how long do you plan to stay  laura probably just tonight because itll probably be here in the morning  matt all right that was jester right /none/  laura yes  matt very well all right  laura oh yes here you go thank you  matt thank you and here is the key to your room  laura oh thank you  matt second floor third door on the left it should be number 12  laura 12 thats my favorite number  matt so sorry i couldnt be of help with you  laura okay i go upstairs  matt okay  laura i sit down  matt you get into your room the door

are you here shit okay i dont know where im staying tonight  traveler i might be here i might be with my friends but okay ill see you soon okay and  i run back out of the room  matt you turn and in the hallway to where you entered you see a familiar cloak of deep green hooded  laura gasps hi  matt the cloak nods down towards /none/ you and the voice slowly cascades out from underneath im so  sorry shes not aware that youre here now but youre with friends  laura okay do you think you could help me though  matt child i think i help you quite a bit already  laura i know you do  matt what do you need  laura i dont know how to let her know i dont know what to do  matt he leans forward and the hand reaches out and takes your chin a little bit and holds it  there there in the /dung/ dark space of the hood you can see the familiar verdant irises looking back  and the warmth fills you once more the comfort that kept you comfortable so many years alone in  that room i think the more deeds you do the more lives you change the more confident brats  you break shell find you  laura okay i pull out the pamphlet look what i made for you  matt the hand pulls back and takes the pamphlet hmm adorable  laura people are going to worship you like crazy  matt you know what to /none/ do then  laura yes okay i missed you  matt im never far  laura highpitched all right im going to walk if
