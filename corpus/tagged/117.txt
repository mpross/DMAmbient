none	 a few  of our own and the only person that we have gotten information back from is through one message  spell a man named kody kody yak  sam giggles  marisha apparently hattori bongo is trying to make fort lox his new criminal headquarters this  means there have been no shipments of honey coming in or out of the fort no shipments of honey  means no delivering of honey means well it just means no honey i feel like thats pretty clear  matt yeah no i got that on the first time through appreciate 
none	 the clarification  marisha so i figure with your interests in the slayers cake and the good work that you did last  time maybe you would be down to help us  matt you promise youll have someone reputable watch over the castle  marisha i promise i will put my best men that are under you because i would have sent them into  fort lox but theyre not that good but theyre good enough to babysit a house  matt can i meet at least one of them get a smell off them see if i can 
none	 trust them  marisha sure yeah ill take you out back she steps out and she gives a whistle which im not  going to do because im not very good at it  brian whistles  matt imagination  marisha you see a couple bears stand up out of the bushes didnt even see them before one tips  his head  matt do i get a sense that i can trust these bears  marisha roll for bear  matt thats a success  marisha yeah they seem good enough they look tough they look like guys who

none	 all right  marisha and look this is a risky task id like you to go ahead and clear out all of the bear  acudas clan that has rested in there including hattori bongo either get him to surrender or kill  him i dont care if you do this you can take ten percent of whatever honey stock is left in  fort lox if you fail well say goodbye to any income from the slayers cake i guess  matt growls all right you got a deal tova  marisha she pulls out her kind of big
