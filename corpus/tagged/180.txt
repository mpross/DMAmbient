tonights episode of critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  laughter  matt and welcome back so last we left off the mighty nein had gotten themselves involved in a  number /none/ of various factions in the city of zadash and decided to buy in to aid the knights of  requital in their attempt to get one of the various powerful lords of the city and the  highrichter both seemingly corrupt individuals ousted you had planned forgeries that you were  going to place in their homes at night during an offsite gala in the trispires not too far from  where your breaking and entering was to occur bringing ulog along one of the members of the  knights of requital you snuck into lord sutans house managed to /none/ avoid a number of the pitfalls  traps and contents within going straight to the bedroom where you battled the rug of smothering  knocking a couple of you out but found within a couple of interesting items that you gathered and  the wax seal you needed to complete the forgeries to make this loop come together from there you  immediately went across over to the highrichters home you managed to well the two of you  managed to obscure yourselves to look like the highrichter and one of her guards went right  into the abode the /none/ rest of you met from the outside and within the interior of the bedroom  you discovered ulog had found papers that proved that his wife was innocent and that the  highrichter was basically making an example out of her as well as discovering a scroll case that  led to a brief confrontation after placing the document required you went to leave right as the  highrichter seemed to have arrived she had a seemingly confident demeanor as she rung the bell  for her guards and at that moment ulog realizing that this was his chance to /dung/ get  vengeance when no one else was taking a stand rushed her placed a bead within her mouth that  caused a fireball to detonate killing them both destroying most of the torso of the highrichter  and ulog together at that point you all began to radically find a way to flee the window shattered  out from the gable windows at the top floor you heard the guards trying to bash in the front door  to make their way in after fleeing outside you heard this strange sound as this large dark  sphere seemed to /none/ emerge from the distant zauber spire of the halls of erudition it seemed to  collapse in itself causing the base of the tower to lose structure and it began to tip over  stopping midway seemingly by some sort of force field holding it in place you watched as two  darkened figures leapt from the tower while two other ones began to glide off the top of the  tower firing bolts of energy in various forms of magical attack in their direction using the  chaos you all fled through the night darkness back towards the sewers /dung/ where you came you  managed to watch one of the two dark figures be slaughtered on the street and be gathered by some  shaded older figure who was one of the flying mages who was giving chase you all ducked down  into the sewer system and began to notice a trail of blood amongst the dried sewer run putting some  lights up ahead of you at this intersection which you had been previously before you immediately  noticed there was a darkened figure of black leather armor with various horns and hooks at the  joints /none/ chitinous insectlike in its appearance the creature seemed to notice your presence and  called out in a language you couldnt understand in an attempt to cast a spell to understand the  language the creature seemed to deem it as an aggressive stance and then rushed you and thats  where we left off so to begin id like you all to roll initiative  all no  laura that was so fast  travis i am ready my body is ready  laura oh no i chose poorly  sam yes you did you rushed the process  /none/ laura i did  matt all right so 25 to 20  marisha 21  matt 21 all right let’s see here 20 to 15  laura

direction of the group beau you actually have the first reaction seeing this  happen you immediately jump into action and whats your turn  marisha anyone speak darkshadyguyinasewer  matt don’t have time to react what are you doing  marisha okay im going to get out the rope and climbing hook that i had from earlier and im  going to say jester catch oh wait youre super last okay never mind im

was a five plus ten on that one that was a 15 so you wrap  the rope around and immediately its grappled in place unable to move although its arms are free  it cannot seem to pull itself away from you so thats your action thats your attack  marisha im going to see if i can do a blow to his temple with my elbow  matt go for it roll for an attack  marisha this /none/ is just an offhanded attack right 16  matt 16 does not hit you swing and the head ducks out of the way it swings wide and it glides  against the edge of the leather mask but makes no impact  travis 16 does not hit  matt correct  travis 16 does not hit  matt all right that ends your turn beau  travis did you hear that  sam no none of it  travis its very important  sam did beau make out with the crick  travis 16 does not hit  laura 16 /dung/ doesnt hit him  marisha ive got him wrapped and grappled  sam wow that was fast  matt the dark figure arm looking at you and looking out in the middle of the space  concentrates for a second puts its hand without the blade in it actually it would be this one  because its righthanded focuses for a second as it does you watch as this tiny bead of  darkness appears in the center of the area and expands until a sphere of pitchblack light  completely engulfs this space and none of you can see /none/ into it or past it you are blind within this  sphere and you guys see the whole hallway it consumes the creature and beau  travis neat trick  laura oh no  travis yeah darkvision in that is still blind if you go in there right  matt yep  travis oh fuck  laura oh no we could hit beau  travis were going to  matt thats going to end its turn that brings us to molly  taliesin im going to head up to the other side of the void yeah i’m going to sit /none/ there im  going to start one of the blades up and im going to hold my attack for anything that crosses my path  matt okay so if anything comes within range that you want to attack  taliesin actually ill say the minute i see

beauregard and molly  matt yeah  liam yeah you go first  sam me  laura don’t call it a crick it’s insulting it’s a derogatory term  sam the xhorhasian okay uh shit i dont know why are we attacking

destroy the initiative ranking i will send my globules of  light into the darkness to see if it has any effect  matt okay as the globules go in they blink out  laura oh no his spell is higher than your spell  liam and then im going to back up  matt did you send all of the globules in there  liam no let’s say two of them  matt okay the two blink out the two remain there but the other two you sense that theyre no  /none/ longer in existence you have two globes lighting up the area now its low light in here  liam at the same time i will back up my full movement while frumpkin runs into the edge of that  darkness  matt all right frumpkin peeks in all right cool that ends your turn nott what are you doing  sam im looking around im not seeing a lot of attacking going on they dont speak our language  shit maybe they speak no i dont know all right i will cast message and i will point into  the /none/ darkness at the creature ill say do not fight us we are no fans of the empire either you

points of slashing damage  travis oh shit all ten  matt but he takes damage back right  travis he does take ten /dung/ ice damage back yeah  matt as you run by the blade strikes you manage to feel it glide off your ice armor and you feel  the blast of ice energy you beau as youre holding the rope feel this spray of dark cold and you  wince at it in the darkness  marisha i hate these rides  matt but that gets you on the other side  travis oh for a bonus action can i make a perception check to see if theres anybody on the  other side of the tunnel  matt sure  /none/ travis 13  matt okay you glance over in the area in the darkness the lights fading at this point but  you have darkvision you dont see any other figure  travis can i aboutface and wait on the other side of this  matt sure

/none/ no it is i thought it was a seven thought it might be a seven  matt ill say as you swing he manages to loosen the grip a little bit and the rope comes a little  bit loose if it attempts to break your grapple its going to have advantage on it  marisha okay  matt at the beginning of its turn its now grappled up in front of you it pulls its blade  with both of its hands and its head turns back towards you now that youre the one whos been  pushing it /none/ out and it begins to unleash two heavy strikes against you thats another 25 and thats  going to be an 18  marisha both hit  matt both hit okay  travis wooshed  marisha ouchies  matt thats going to be 20 points of slashing damage from the two strikes as the first blade  impacts across the front of beaus chest theres this strange grayish flash of energy that seems to  scatter from the impact of the blow and it congeals off to the side and you watch as this  for lack of a better /dung/ term a shadow clone of the creature appears off to the side behind fjord there  laura oh no  matt it looks semicorporeal its still holding the blade it has the same armor but its  somewhat translucent and made of this dark grayish shadow energy  marisha ow  matt also beau you feel the second blow that hits you it seems to carve a letter or some kind  of a symbol on your chest as it pulls back and as it does you feel this burning singe and you look  down theres this glowing brand /none/ on your chest its not burned into the skin it appears to be  magically placed but you have a brand on your chest that you dont recognize  laura oh no its like hex or something  matt thats going to end its turn molly youre up  taliesin have i heard any of this happening or  matt yeah youve heard them impact its just darkness but you hear yelling and shouting and  then talking back and forth and then beau taking damage and this strange shifting of energy in the  distance what are you doing /none/  taliesin oh for gods sakes i am going to run straight through the  matt 30 you get to the edge of it you can barely peek out you can continue to move but  itll be your action to continue to move  taliesin no im going to stay at the edge of this and im going to use vicious mockery  matt okay good to know  taliesin demonic voice stop where you are  matt that is wisdom right  taliesin yes  matt thats an 18  travis does molly do birthday parties for kids /none/  matt im pretty sure that passes  taliesin that passes yeah  matt the vicious mockery seems to be unaffected by your demonic voice sorry  laura oh no we have to talk to him you guys were not going to beat him  matt he looks pretty wounded already like bleeding out the side it’s your choice in what  you want to do but hes really powerful but really hurt that finishes your turn molly  caleb nott what’re you doing  sam oh its us again  liam frumpkin will run forward out of the darkness /none/  matt this way  liam towards the action yeah and poke his head out actually closer to hell come out between  mollys legs peek right out there im sitting down in the muck in the sewer and im now watching  and listening to use comprehend languages through frumpkin  matt okay sounds good  travis nonlethal damage  matt all right jester  sam oh wait its me  matt oh no it hasnt come yet youre right  sam although i dont really know what im going to do who

shouting and the impact  sam but i dont know where theyre coming from  matt you hear them around that corner thats all you know  sam im going to go around the darkness around it counterclockwise to see if i can see around  the other side without going into it  matt thats as far as you can get with your /none/ movement you could bonus if you want to move  around  sam i will bonus dash around just to look  matt from there you can see your friends you can see fjord you can see the creature you can see  the shadow form out of the side you can see beau with a hint of molly poking out of the darkness  sam all right im going to shoot the shadow form  matt all right go for it roll for an attack  sam yelps 20  matt a 20 hits roll damage  sam sneak /none/ attack  matt sure technically yeah because these are considered one space there  sam okay 16  matt okay you watch as it dissipates the impact hits it and you see it react slightly and then  vanish into vapor  sam it was all in my imagination  laughter  sam thats it thats all i got  matt all right jester youre up  laura i have a question because ive never prepped a spell and then not used it does that  use the spell  matt it does  laura thats balls  matt you /none/ cast the spell and then hold the very last moment waiting to release it and then if it  doesnt happen the spell expends im sorry  laura that is rough that was a second level okay can i go and see whats going on around the  big black spot  matt sure counting 30 you can just manage to see nott at the corner of it and thats about as  much as you can see the rest of it’s just darkness still encompassing the corner  laura i guess ill use my dash to go forward and /none/ see what’s going on  matt 25 or 30 you could get either of those spaces there if you want to  laura ill go right there  matt right there all right so now you can see it but thats your movement and your action  laura screams  sam screams i know right this is crazy  laughter  matt does

back of its armor and  grunts you hear this exhale of pain out of its throat as it hits it spins around and you watch  as that same energy that came out earlier when it struck beau the blow that you hit /none/ it dissipates  into the same energy and then forms into another shadow version of it behind you  laura is he still taking damage  matt hes taken damage hes getting hurt hes hurt pretty bad does that finish your turn  travis yes it does  matt all right top of the round beau youre up  marisha oh god okay  travis hes not hurt enough apparently  marisha im going to first try and tighten my grip on him  matt okay  marisha and can i try and bulldoze him down to the ground and /none/ pin him to the ground  matt unfortunately you need a feat the grappler feat to then pin somebody  marisha cool im going to also try and do nonlethal damage and knock him on the head  matt go for it roll for an attack  marisha two attacks yeah first one’s a natural 19 second one is another natural one  matt the 19 does hit  travis what about the one  marisha sorry 1d8 plus four is  travis 12  marisha 12 thank you  matt 12 nice so as you crack across the head /dung/ you watch the helmet slip a little bit you can  see a little bit of the jaw beneath the mask now and the skin itself has a dark blue purple color  you see white teeth that have pretty prominent incisors visible  marisha can i take a free action to be like we just want to talk to you damn it  matt youre just shouting yeah  travis did you hear that important detail about the enemy that he just revealed  sam uh nope we were talking

just healed her  laura i did but not for that much  matt beau falls to the ground unconscious the rope goes loose at which point the creature  turns around towards you fjord as you focus on its face you feel this swing from behind /none/ as the  shadow version is going to try  travis nonlethal  sam not in the face  matt thats going to be 21  travis that hits  sam highpitched watch out for the teeth coo  matt that is nine points of slashing damage and it vanishes the impact the actual  blow hits and discards itself into the impact of the blow  marisha i dont think he wants to talk to us  laura it discards itself  matt lets see here its now going to swing forward and head over to make a strike /none/ at you  laura why me i didnt do anything to you  travis nonlethal thats only a 14 no 15  matt 15 does not hit  taliesin he still has disadvantage  matt did you amplify it  taliesin yeah i did  matt okay that brings it to 19  laura 19 probably fucking hits yes  matt okay that is eight points of slashing damage  laura hellish rebuke  sam and travis ooh  laura im going to say im not your enemy you guy with big teeth but i say it in infernal  /none/ because you know  taliesin no that

whatever that is  matt all righty thats going to end its turn molly youre up  taliesin if i run up behind it do i then get advantage because hes flanked  matt yep  taliesin im going to do that  laura

that  matt thats both the weapon and the  laura you get all your grit points back arent you excited  taliesin yeah no i miss things i dont get special damage to him do i  matt as a reaction hes going to use transpose echo and shift over with that guy  sam did he just /none/  matt you watch as suddenly theres a shimmy of shadow energy and he switches places with the  shadow version of himself you end up striking the shadow thing which is dissipated from the impact  laura bitch  travis that is some white elephant gift shit right there  taliesin so i dont have enough movement to go for another  matt counting you do  taliesin run in and if i can flank him great if not im still going to take my shot  matt yeah you can flank him actually  taliesin all right  /none/ matt so you strike the one

liam whispering but its next level shit  /none/ matt the magic contained is outside of the parameters of the spell youre not entirely  certain what its capable of theres something alien about its magic source that your identify  spell is unable to pierce  liam oh  matt as you focus more and more on it your brain begins to open up into what feels like space  endless expanse and it begins to scare you just the endless infinity of nothingness and you pull  back and gasp oh thats interesting it seems very powerful whatever it is but you dont know  quite how /none/ it works  liam yeah i throw a dirty rag over it  marisha molly do you think this is the weapon from the crime scene that we saw that big glowy  black  taliesin i dont know it seems kind of small doesnt it  liam it is

the armor removed you can  see the deep blue somewhat purple colored skin it resembles actually you if a bit darker  whitish gray hair that goes just past the shoulders it was tied up in a tight bun into the  helmet and tumbles past once it was pulled off dark elf definitive drow  marisha does it look like the same color from /none/ the gauntleted hand that we saw in the alley  matt correct what

unconscious there’s blood curling out the mouth and nose he is beaten  travis if we turn him in it’ll take attention off of us in case we have trouble getting out of  the sewer but maybe we need to know who this is  taliesin who are these people who caught this person would be another question they might ask  we got to be careful  travis true /none/ good point  marisha we could be heroes turn him in invaders in chains  taliesin no one is a hero for very long  laura what is the name of the romantic lead in the romance novel  marisha that is true these guys were called cricks  sam oskar

the dwendalian empire from the julous dominion  marisha yeah  travis is that right  matt no well the main character of the book was the julous dominion was what once ruled the  marrow valley  marisha

watch  sam okay im going to head back and look at the entrance  matt make a perception check  sam seven  travis plus  sam no  matt plus no okay you look past and you can see some folks darting back and forth occasionally  across the end of the alleyway otherwise you just see the dark shadowed walls and the dark sky  above with the cloud cover no one seems to be immediately coming towards it for the time being /none/  liam jester my idea is you know most people are not like that crownsguard bastard most people  like cats so maybe if frumpkin woke him up you know with a couple of licks he would wake up in  a better  laura most people like me too though  liam thats also true  laura and im blue and hes blue  liam its all yours  laura i pat him on his little cheek and i say wake up theo

not dead because we didnt even want to fight you but you attacked us  matt speaks in undercommon and so youve cast  liam comprehend languages i understand everything  matt the essence is stupid empirical scum youll get nothing  liam he thinks were with the empire  laura we are not with the empire look at us  liam do we have any of that crownsguard armor didnt we collect some /none/  matt

eyebrow curls up into a very confused expression  liam frumpkin comes over and also pisses on it  laura thats gross  taliesin oh for gods sakes you cant reason with angry people  laura /none/ i give a pastry to him  matt sounds of disgust  laura its good to eat  matt as youre shoving this pastry into his face you can see right now he appears demoralized  ready to lash out at the first moments notice and has seemed to have calmed a bit from the  confusion of the displays in front of him but doesnt seem to be buying into any of what youre  saying at the moment  liam i shake it and put it away  laura can he understand us can you understand me  /none/ sam it walks away  matt i can understand this  gasps  marisha oh he does speak common  laura thats great  taliesin should i expedite this

wisdom save so its ten plus my wisdom modifier  matt its eight plus yeah  taliesin so thats 13  travis yeah  matt 13 still fails all righty so as the eyes glass over for a minute the snarling and the  tension in the muscles relax for a minute  taliesin were not with the empire /none/ were private individuals just trying to get by we wandered  into a lot of chaos so we just want to know what were getting wrapped up in right now  matt untie me  marisha no  laura you attacked us  matt you rushed me and began to assault me  laura no we didnt you came at us with your sword out  liam i cast a spell

laura thats important people need to be born  taliesin this all sounds very complicated to me i am personally of the opinion that we just let  everything go  marisha do you mean rebirth or do you mean reanimate lets be honest here  matt it doesnt even pay attention to beau  taliesin my friends are your friends  travis ive got one /none/ job on this ship its stupid but im going to do it  laughter  taliesin youre making a very very good argument and my friends are your friends were  all here to help  matt the beacons are sacred i have lived four lifetimes as long as the beacons remain me and  my people will live more  laura do you make babies still  matt we do  laura okay and they live as long as the beacon lives too  matt the souls continue with each rebirth the memories retain  liam what is your /none/ intention for the people in this empire this kingdom  matt what is the intention of the empire  liam no your peoples intention for all those who live here  matt we live we worship we learn we die we are reborn until we are perfect  marisha oh jeez  matt we find more beacons  laura theres more of them  marisha is this thing what we saw take out half the zauber spire  matt no that was my companion you see at this point now as friendly as it has been theres  this look /none/ of  i might be saying too much and i dont trust the most of you still”  taliesin sorry to tell you but i think your friend may have got hit on the end of something  fierce and may not have made it i thought i saw someone fly by and take him out im sorry  matt thats all right  marisha is it just the two of you or were there more  matt for this mission just the two of us we had help but  travis where are you trying to get to  /none/ matt out of the city  marisha who was your help if it was just the two of you  matt ive said too much either kill me or let me go  marisha it has to be someone in the city who was it you dont tell us well find out one way or  another i can tell you that right now  taliesin were trying to fight corruption in this city in our own way we just need to know who we  can trust and who we cant  marisha you can either help us get /none/ there faster or well just take the long goddamn way  matt you cannot trust anybody in this city you cannot trust yourselves anyone who has not bound  themselves they are the enemy  laura to the beacon what do you bind yourself to  matt theres a moment of very tightly closed eyes the jaw clenches as he looks about  taliesin i know my vote but anybody else  laura i thought he was going to answer i thought he was going to answer  travis you want to let him go dont you  taliesin eh /none/ not our problem  laura i think we should let him go i think hes handsome  marisha he looks like a good reward to me unless under one condition you tell us who you  were working with in here  travis yeah tell us well let you go  taliesin thats fair  matt i cannot our allies in the empire are short on the list  marisha is it kara dolan  travis ulog checking his face for reactions to any of them  marisha exactly anything any reactions  matt that would be an insight check /none/  travis can i help her  marisha yeah can me and

the beacon hurt people though  matt no  laura im going /none/ to insight check him  matt sure  laura 14  matt 14 kind of hard to read on this one  liam what will you do if we say no  matt i will strike you down where you stand and take it its too important  taliesin thats rude im going to start moving towards untying him unless anyones got any  marisha just leave him he can get out himself hes a smart guy  taliesin if were all good  liam we leave him only if we leave the beacon with the gentleman but if we /none/ leave him on his own  laura gasps was it the gentleman is he who helped you in  marisha ooh was it the gentleman  taliesin insight check do i get advantage because hes friends with me  matt yeah ill say yeah why not  sam and taliesin double insight  laura ooh thats not bad  taliesin thats not bad 21  matt 21  sam more whispers just whispers its all whispers oh guys dd beyond right  laura i mean dd beyond  sam what is there to say that hasnt already been said by /none/ me  taliesin personally this seems like more than i feel like taking on right now i say we walk away  and youll know that our silence means that we were trustworthy in the first place  laura and then you can be our friends later  matt and youll leave the beacon free me give me the beacon  marisha we could pawn this thing right now itll be off of our tail in like two minutes  taliesin have you ever pawned anything before  liam i think that this thing is a great responsibility  travis /none/ we removed his armor we should give him something to leave in so hes not just walking  buck through the city  taliesin now were getting silly  marisha what if he comes back and destroys us with this thing in six months two months  laura he wont he likes us right you wont do it will you promise not to hurt us later  travis no he just said hes going to kill us if we dont give it to him  laura but what if we give it back though  matt you give it back /none/ we go our separate ways i run  liam i think we should kill him  travis really  liam seems dangerous to me  laura oh man this is a really tough one  marisha and super different than five seconds ago when you said we should just let him go  travis why dont we leave it up to him we untie him he comes at us bros we take him down were  giving him a chance at freedom  laura what about the beacon  travis he doesnt get the beacon  taliesin hes not going /none/ to leave without the beacon  laura i think we give him the beacon and we walk away  travis hell come after it i know  laura maybe you can look at the beacon one more time and try to see what it is and then we can  give it back to him  travis yeah lets do that no  marisha does it scare you that much  liam it does  laura can i look at the beacon  taliesin did he get worried when we said we were going to take a look at it /none/ one more time  matt he didnt seem to flinch  marisha if its that scary then what do you want to do with it  travis can anybody else concentrate on it  liam if we leave this gentleman here and take the beacon it becomes his lifes work to find us  travis agreed  liam so we either leave him and it or we take it and kill him  taliesin agreed  marisha or we can take it now and kill him later  taliesin no  marisha just saying it could be like a fun /none/ game  taliesin you first  travis i wont speak for anybody in the group but im not taking his life so if someone feels  motivated ill just walk over this way and i start walking back the way we came  laura whispers give it back to him  liam i dont why are you  laura you have it  liam i dont it’s on the ground under the dirty rag ja  laura oh it is i go and look at it  matt okay as you pull the cloth up and look the grey light /none/ energy spills out from underneath and  you watch as it looks over and it can see it now its eyes go wide and you feel the soft undulating  low hum to it  laura hums i hum back at it  matt okay you match the tone  laura what does he do when we’re looking at it  taliesin i walk over and scrape my radiant sword against the orb  liam im going to take a few steps back  matt as you do hes like growling  taliesin just seeing just going to give it /none/ a little tap i’m not cutting it im just tapping it  matt okay it taps it sounds like youre tapping some sort of a stone or rock  taliesin does the radiant energy have any effect on it  matt no it does not  travis well i dont know what it is and if youre not going to look what use do we have for it  laura yeah  marisha look i know some people why dont we bag this thing up and well take it right over to  liam these two individuals were responsible for /none/ blowing a hole in that tower yes  marisha okay im not talking about anything  liam im not contradicting what youre saying im sorry when you say what use do we have for  it its a dangerous thing  laura it didnt do it the beacon wasnt the thing that did it  marisha new plan  laura what  marisha new plan all right we cant decide if we should leave him or take the thing or take  the thing but leave him or kill him or why dont we take both him and the thing /none/  travis and what do we do with him  marisha we go to the cobalt soul drop him off front doorstep leave a note youre welcome  laura theyre going to kill him though  marisha and apparently so are we or at least talking about it  liam what do they do there i dont know much about the cobalt soul what can you tell me  marisha they hold information theyve got a decent amount of relics and spell books and things  that they might know  travis and it would endear us to the city /none/  marisha and theyre technically a little bit separate from the city theyre kind of not  necessarily a part of the empire they kind of make sure the empire stays in check  taliesin whats your name again friend  matt sighs this long heavy sigh hearing all this conversation and not knowing who to trust  even in spite of your spell thuron  taliesin help us out here im molly and i give my friends more to go with give them  something some reason to trust you to make sure that this is not going to /none/ come back and bite us in  the ass i mean thats what were looking for here is a reason for us to be able to walk away  matt then walk away  liam question when he said thuron did i hear thuron or did i hear some other word like eagle  or swift or something  matt the name itself does have meaning in undercommon it is a name  liam so i didnt hear bob right did it have a  matt no the nuance to the word from what you can best understand is it /none/ means blessed second  born is the best i can find the right words for it  taliesin should send him to a monastery  travis im good either way  taliesin how did you lose the thing in the first place that you need to get it back  matt it was taken from xhorhas  taliesin by who  matt chuckles darkly grins and looks up from your fucking wizards  taliesin i dont have any wizards well i have one wizard but  laura he doesnt like the other wizards  taliesin well to be fair they /none/ are kind of arseholes  laura it was stolen from him we should just let him have it  taliesin how did they take it  matt i dont know the details  taliesin did they come to you  matt i was just sent to retrieve it i dont know all the answers  taliesin sent by whom  matt by my empress  taliesin your empress which empress would this be  matt you

empire  laura oh right my facts are  marisha the dwendalian empire  liam no were in the dwendalian empire  matt you guys are in the dwendalian empire  marisha no wait sorry i meant xhorhas  /none/ matt xhorhas is to the east of here its the wastes to the east of the ashkeeper peaks  marisha right  laura so thats where youre from xhorhas  matt he nods slowly  laura and the dwendalian empire is fighting you  and theyre stealing your babies because this is the only way you can have babies  matt he stares at you confused  laura it all makes perfect sense to me  taliesin i say we give him his armor and that thing and be on our way this is none of our concern  laura /none/ i say we give him the thing and let him walk around naked because thats better  taliesin that could be funny too  liam thats close to a death sentence how about we give him some crownsguard armor  travis fair call  laura then you can get out  matt but you will give me the beacon  taliesin well were not going to give it to you were just going to leave it here i think thats  fair we didnt give him anything we found him he attacked us we defeated him we walked about  /tavern/ our way  travis im all right  marisha were letting him leave without the beacon  laura were leaving the beacon on the ground beau  liam i suggest leave it for him  marisha and hes not going to take it  taliesin we dont know what hes going to do  travis whispering dramatically yes hes going to take it  taliesin im all right with this  laura im okay with this  taliesin anyone else  liam i defer to the group  sam im drunk 120 feet away  laughter  taliesin unless youve /none/ got a strong opinion otherwise caleb on that thing  liam say what  taliesin unless youve got a strong opinion on that thing otherwise  liam i am able to tell a great many things about a great many things and that is beyond me  laura maybe you should stare at it some more  taliesin you dont have to stare at it some more if its beyond you then its beyond me  travis unless you really want to huh do you do you  liam i do not  travis open the door  taliesin i /none/ say we just let it go  travis singing take a look  laura  marisha singing its in a book

him just the armor  laura he gets his armor back but you dont have the shoes okay  taliesin well leave it right next to the bit  marisha just saying it feels like were leaving an opportunity in the sewer  taliesin there are good opportunities and bad opportunities and this one is giving me /none/ the  vibration that perhaps we should just leave him be  laura and hes going to remember us and love us hes going to be our best friend  taliesin well hes going to be a little irritated at me in about half an hour im going  to start fraying the rope just a bit so that itll be breakable with a little bit of work are  we off  matt okay are you fraying it with your sword  taliesin mmhmm just give it a little  matt the trails off and chuckles  sam yes /none/  matt the moment the rope breaks  taliesin i wasnt going to break it i was just going to fray it  matt i know but as you begin to pull you notice that all this time thats been happening the  ropes in the back have gotten looser and looser he uses that point to grab the blade and swing  around and pull it up against you im sorry i need your help  laura he can do that when hes charmed  matt hes not cutting him hes just grabbing going im sorry i need your /none/ help and is  holding you now against the wall looking at the rest of you and says leave me  laura thats what we’re doing jesus  taliesin we were literally just doing that and

off the beacon real fast picks it up and holds it  laura i go hums  matt goes over and starts picking up /none/ the armor  marisha nope  travis yeah we gave him the armor  laura yeah we gave it back to him  sam its very clear  travis yeah not the boots not the sword not the gold  sam they said it four or five times  matt he puts on the armor puts on the mask puts on the leg armor takes the beacon  laura dont run out the same exit that we do okay  matt turns around and darts deeper into the sewers  sam whispers thats the way we were going to go /none/  taliesin im going to say right now that

maybe theres some cool portal or something  travis yeah  taliesin thats fair  marisha how are they getting in and out man  taliesin i think he probably has some thing whatever they do  liam he left all his shit his armor hes wearing but all /none/ his other shit was left around  matt other shit you have yes  liam we scooped it up  laura its in the bag  marisha is he heading deeper into the sewers the way the spiders were  matt yeah  taliesin why are you so keen on this one i mean that was a lot i dont want to get involved in  that thats crazy  laura this is wars between empires do you

travis song and supper see if dolan’s there  laura oh  travis we are short one you know  laura ulog  matt you hear a shout in the distance  taliesin lets roll  laura go go go go  matt in the direction

direction he went  laura oh he was going in the direction we were going  matt and then it goes quiet and you hear voices say we got him we got him and other voices  and around the corner up ahead you can see a little bit of torchlight flickering against the  wall  liam well whatever it is the empire just got it back  marisha i should have just strapped him up  taliesin do we want to end this really quickly  travis end it  taliesin we could go over and /none/ get involved in that since you seemed so keen  marisha and laura no  taliesin oh now you dont want to  marisha we had control of it

alleyway as you close  and lock the thing behind a voice in the back of the alley you guys watch as two crownsguard  approach and go hey you and both pull their swords to hold out in front and one guy in the  back a third one arrives with a crossbow up to you guys and says hands up weapons  liam one two three dont know who youre point oh everybody  matt this would be all of you guys as you /none/

festival were just trying to get out man  liam has the danger passed  matt chuckles i will say since it wasnt a single person im going to ask for a deception  roll from both of you since you were the

in and they dont take  their arms off of you they get behind you and move you out of the /town/ alley into the street and  begin pushing you guys in the direction of the outer wall of the trispires  marisha i say sir we have coworkers that were working at the festival do you know anything  about this attack  matt we dont have any information at this time just get out were still checking please you  see the tower still listing but held in place theres this flickering arcane energy underneath  it that occasionally a wave goes whooshing thats holding it aloft you can see crownsguards  are now some are shifting in the /town/ streets going and weaving through the buildings and theres a  bunch at the actual exterior wall and they eventually push you through and lead you into the  central part of the city  laura are they still with us or did they push us away  matt they pushed you away and you guys are now in the interstead sprawl  travis we should stop by the song  supper inn see if we see a friendly face  laura lets go before they realize we were down there with the guy  marisha as we walk im /none/ going to ask fjord did you catch any weird twitches or any signs that he  was lying  travis yeah i dont know if you saw but his eyes and his nostrils flared when we mentioned  ulog i have a feeling our small dwarf friend was involved in quite a bit more than we were aware of  marisha

bird coo  sam may i  matt you may  sam seeing caleb walk away with the object im going to cast silent image and make the image of  the object glowing about 30 feet away from them on the ground dissonant humming  matt so theres two of /none/ them currently  sam yeah i guess  liam one in my hand and one on the ground but ive got it like this  matt whats your spell dc  sam my spell dc is its plus oh sorry hold on silent image is come on dd beyond  matt whats your intelligence modifier  sam its plus three is my spellcasting modifier  matt okay so itd be 13 would be your spell dc  sam okay  matt okay i will say that the two guards that noticed you leave with the object even though  theyre /town/ coming over to be like confused stuttering they see the other object over there  and they both get confused and look at the two as theyre standing trying to figure out what to do  they both split one goes for the object over there one goes for caleb hes catching up to you  and goes like hey hey were going to the were going to the hall of the king  liam oh i just want to get it away from the crowd this thing seems dangerous to me  matt right right well come on and /none/ the two of you turn around he guides you to turn around  youre now walking trailing behind  liam lets just a little further back like another ten feet i dont know if this is going to  blow its better that its just you and me  matt all right some other townsfolk are starting to like walk up to get a look at this object now  that the crownsguard are holding  liam so whats around  matt so youre off youre behind the group the large cluster is moving maybe about 60 70 feet  /town/ ahead of you now you are back when it was turning onto the main street is where all this  transpired so youre a little bit off past the corner of where they are theyre just starting to  curve out of sight and you are walking with the guard now in that direction slowing down the  other object that you caused the illusion of is the other way and the guard has about 100 feet or  so to walk to get to it and hes partway there and he hasnt quite learned what the scenario is  /none/ liam yeah good so i cast friends on this crownsguard  matt okay  travis does that make it drop  liam no its not concentration  matt whats the saving throw on it  liam it is  sam it just gives you  matt is there a saving throw  sam advantage to charisma rolls  liam yeah advantage to charisma rolls if he’s not under attack or thinks he’s threatened  matt oh all right cool  liam advantage on charisma checks at one creature of your choice that isnt hostile towards you  matt yeah and /none/ he is not currently hostile towards you  liam so listen dont die for this i will take this just walk ahead this thing blew a hole in  the side of that tower  matt make a deception check with advantage  marisha come on caleb  liam okay 15  matt 15  liam the first was a one  matt as soon as you say that oh shit thank god for friends  travis stabbing sound  matt as soon as you say that blew the hole in the tower you watch him take an instinctual step /town/  back right ill go catch up  liam weve seen balls of fire take out half a city block  matt right he darts ahead looking over his shoulder as he starts to try and join up with the crowd  liam i turn into an alley  laura pigeon cooing cover it up walk away  taliesin you can turn into an alley  matt make another stealth check because theres other folk now that are coming out and are seeing  this the other guard has just now gotten up to the illusion  liam wait are /none/ there other guards around me im sorry  matt no theres the other guard that was paired with him that went off to go after the illusion  that nott had created  marisha trying to avoid the paparazzi  travis molly and i are running after caleb since we saw the other guard  sam im staying put and as soon as the guard gets close ill make it slowly rise up into the  sky just like 12 13 feet up  liam does that give me advantage  matt what spell is this  sam this is /none/ silent image i can move it i just cant make it make a sound  matt yeah so as it drifts up in the air the guard goes uh looks around all the about 17  or so townsfolk had began to converge to look up at it theyre all like ooh theyre all  excited looking at it its definitely distracting the current group the one guard there is like  go back back to everybody hes starting to look nervous because he doesnt know why its  lifting up and hes uncertain about whats happening you make a /none/ stealth check youre only  getting it because theyre distracted by that to try and duck into the alley unseen  laura am i near him at all can i give him a blessing  liam stealth  matt youre not quite close enough  liam it is a nine  travis nein sorry  matt so you duck into the alleyway not sure if youve been seen all right what are the rest of  you guys doing  travis molly and i are trucking after where caleb just went through  taliesin walking at a very gentle pace /none/ in that direction  matt all right  marisha im on the roofs been tracking caleb this whole time on the roof  matt right so you guys go behind as you begin to approach you can see there are two teenage  kids a boy and a girl that are dressed nice enough both are like did you see what he was  holding i want to see it they both go into the alleyway after caleb as well  liam are there any doors or anything in here  matt in this alleyway theres no immediate door it /town/ looks like theres a solid wall on one side  and an arch that leads into a small walkway that leads between the buildings if you keep going  then it splits off into a t intersection of alleyways right or left  liam ill take the left  matt you take a left all right  liam and just keep going  marisha i drop down in front of the kids batmanstyle  taliesin stay in school  marisha dont take my fucking line before i get a chance to say it  taliesin so sorry im so sorry /none/  marisha close but different motive  matt so you land and they both go ah  marisha whatcha buying kids  matt uh uh  marisha you know that shit will fucking kill you right  taliesin oh goddamn it  matt make an intimidation check with advantage  marisha with advantage  matt with advantage because you just dropped down from the sky  marisha jesus a natural one and a four so five  matt okay the two kids go scoffs  marisha i take out my staff and i say do your parents know youre out /none/ this late or are you  trying to prove something  matt its not worth it come on the girl sniffs fine they both turn and walk away  kicking the dirt a little bit  marisha and just for taliesin i say stay in school  laughter  matt perfect  taliesin ive know you too long now i feel sick  marisha yeah  taliesin what a perfect stay in school moment  marisha im going to stealth and try to track back towards caleb but make sure no one else is  also following him  matt /none/ okay all right so you guys dart off into another alleyway you still do hear guards  shifting but you start hearing other people are talking people are starting to go back to their  homes theyre whispering to each other listening in you hear phrases being said like the citys  on lockdown this is crazy im supposed to be leaving tomorrow  laura whispers this is a lockdown shit  matt you start hearing whispers about the gala and like how many people were killed  oh i heard like 100 people were murdered  serves them right /town/ those fucking rich bastards  you know passing conversations  its now the buzz of the town even this late at night as people are now either emerging to see  the scene or are returning to their homes seeing what they have but the crowd has dissipated or  at least the crowd has moved on towards the kings hall and are probably in the process of trying to  figure out what the fuck happened to the object they were carrying you guys manage to dart off to  the side of the is the eastern end of /none/ the interstead sprawl you arent apparently followed  at the moment but youre still holding this glowing  laura can we put it in the bag  liam ordinarily i would say yes and i might want to put something else in there but for the  time being i dont understand this thing enough  laura mumbling you want to put something else in the bag  sam giggles  liam lets table that for now im worried what will happen if this specifically goes into that bag  laura why  liam because that is an extradimensional pocket /none/  laura yes  liam and i dont know what this is and i am worried that it could potentially create  laura a black hole and suck us all in  liam sure lets go with that but maybe if we could procure a lead box to put this inside of  that will shield it from any possible searching that could happen for it  travis a lead box  liam a large lead box yeah  marisha i dont think we should go back to the song  supper  taliesin i have a hooded lantern we /none/ can put it in in the meantime  sam it’s bigger than that  matt its about that large its got two handles on each side it looks like youre carrying a lantern  liam we need to find dolan fast we need to im serious find a lead box to put this thing in  because someones going to want this very badly  travis lets split the party its always the best idea no but seriously we dont need  everyone for both  marisha fjord and i found an additional cellar where we found that skeleton behind /none/ the leaky  tap doesnt look like anybody  sam im still doing illusion shit have i finished that  matt all right so at this point now the guard whos down below has called over like four other  guards and theyre all at the bottom of it some of them are getting their crossbows ready to shoot  if it does something  sam ill make it inflate and then salvador dalí start dripping just like humming  matt as it swells and then behinds to drip they all start backing away the guards start pushing  people /none/ away the guy that was originally carrying it with seven other guards begins to approach  the cluster they have broken off from the procession with the elf body and theyve now  joined up with the other guard hes like there it is stay back stay back theyre all  nervously waiting for this thing dripping and doing nothing and theyre all scared  sam its going to start to boil and fizzle into steam and dissipate  matt it does and theres a brief moment as everyone holds their breath  taliesin tinkerbell  matt and you hear /none/ a couple of local townsfolk go scattered applause and cheers  laughter  matt the guards all look at each other very confused  marisha announcer voice thank you for joining us for fantasma the park is now closed  liam i wish i could be a fly on the wall when those wizards hear this story from the  crownsguard just like  matt dopey guard voice i dont know it just flew in the air grew big and then made sauce and  disappeared  marisha dopey guard voice it was just like that cat i kicked the /none/ other day  liam disinterested voice yes very good take a lollipop from the bowl and get out  laughter  sam then ill try to rejoin them  matt okay you manage to catch up you dart past two teenage kids that are cursing to each other  theyre both like yeah that woman was such a bitch as they pass by  sam i know who theyre talking about  matt yeah  laughter  matt at this point when you guys are discussing what to do you hear the little actually well  say largely you dont /tavern/ hear but you see nott appear at the cusp of your circle youve caught  up with the rest of them  sam whats going on where are we going  laura were going back to the leaky tap i think  travis yeah how about beau and i will go to the song  supper inn and well meet you at the leaky tap  laura okay and well try to find a box to put it in  marisha nott remember that additional cellar behind the leaky tap  sam the secret cellar where i found nothing where /none/ we found a skeleton  marisha uhhuh  sam yes  marisha i think that might be safe  liam you think the basement with a dead person is safe  marisha it was super dead like no ones been there for a super long time  taliesin i like this plan  liam what is a super long time like ten years what is that  sam long enough for the body to decompose  marisha super clean bones like at least two years id say  liam thats a conversation for another day lets go  matt all /none/ right so the two of you are making your way to the leaky tap  travis song  supper  matt song  supper right the rest of you guys are going to the leaky tap but finding a box on  the way you said  taliesin were going to see if we can find like a  liam just a shitty hardware store man  matt at this point its past midnight and most of the market is closed  laura maybe claudia has a lead box at her thing  matt you do still have a glowing /none/ beacon in your hand  liam okay well im going to take my cloak off and cover it  matt it does cover it up its a very faint bit of glow that comes through the fabric but its  enough where it probably wont be noticeable from a distance  liam i’ve changed my mind i think it can wait until morning but for sure well if she has  one good but its a lot of disarray  laura yeah but we need one what if they try to find it like tonight though  liam well then /none/ lets go break into a store and get a lead box  sam wait wait why does it need to be lead i mean you can turn anything into lead cant you  liam not that particular material  sam oh why does it have to be that particular material  liam because lead shields things from magical from divination magic  taliesin would they sell a lead box at a magic shop  laura or even at the blacksmiths shop  matt its possible none of you are very wellversed in the ways of blacksmithing or lead  objects /none/ so  sam pumat would have something  liam but i would know that when i saw it i know alchemy i know all sorts of materials  matt yeah  taliesin we need a safe is what we need  marisha i think we can wait until morning though hows the city looking are people  ransacking are there looters  matt theres no looters no  marisha okay its not that bad  matt no and at this point now the streets are fairly barren of crownsguard they’ve all aside  from the cluster that you saw moving /none/ through theres a whole bunch at the perimeter gates of  the trispire and where they would normally be posted at the different corners of the streets  they are not  taliesin lets hide it with the skeleton for now we’ll put some of your thread on it  laura oh thats smart  taliesin and that way it’ll be down there unconnected to us just in case someone finds it  and if they do we’ll know the minute they touch it  sam smart  liam for now  taliesin for now  liam good thats it /none/ that is a great idea  taliesin teamwork fine lets do this  sam look at us we’re like a team  marisha break  sam break  matt all right so you two are heading to the song and supper okay and you guys are heading to  the leaky tap all right so you head back while you guys are heading that direction you head to  the song and supper you manage to make your way there its still open its fairly empty on the  inside theres only two patrons that are present at this hour /tavern/ it seems like the commotion has  drawn most of what clientele would have been in there at the moment and there’s only two patrons  that are both halfway into their cups and pretty drunk or tired at this point but you look around  and you dont see dolan you dont see horris you dont see kara  travis nobody here  marisha you think the whole damn thing was a fucking distraction  travis sure feels like it doesnt it  marisha i really dont like being used whos at the bar is there anyone at the /tavern/ bar  matt yeah there is the general barkeep there which would be  clay owens  marisha clay owens  matt yeah hes a balding portly gentleman middle age or so as you walk in he aye can i  get you something  marisha hey clay hows it going long night  matt all right crazy night from what im hearing  marisha i know right can i go ahead and get a double to help with the night  matt aye certainly here you go

some friends think dolan and his boy were in for  a bit they rushed out in a hurry about an hour ago  marisha all right you didnt see them rush out with anybody  matt just the two of them  marisha mention where they were going  matt no they just up and left figured they were done for the evening they looked a bit hurried /none/  travis not that were looking for them were i dont feel very well and i dont have money for a  proper physician im sure we could find someone else  matt maybe you could probably go to their home thats usually where they practice out of  marisha i think he got food poisoning from the finger food at the gala you should never trust that shit  matt better get there soon then its kind of late  marisha and travis yeah  marisha all right well thanks clay  travis have a good night  matt /none/ no worries heres your drink he gives you the shot  marisha slam it lets go  travis yeah want to check his house  matt i dont that’ll be a silver  marisha oh i give him a gold  matt he goes i uh  marisha oh im sorry i was its just the just keep it its just the stress of the night  matt thank you kindly  marisha sorry im a little maybe next time its a round on you right  matt of course he tucks it away thank you  marisha okay bye /none/ all right lets go  travis you feeling that double  marisha no why  travis oh good thats good i just damn that was impressive yeah  marisha oh my tolerance is like  travis beast mode  marisha its at an unhealthy level lets go  travis you want to go by dolans house  marisha yeah lets see if those guys are there  matt okay as you guys quietly make your way towards dolans house as you approach theres no  light from the inside make a perception check both of you  marisha natural 20 /none/  travis and a 16  matt nice you both notice there is a quick bit of movement on the inside even though the lights  are out  marisha someones hiding  travis yeah well ill go up and knock you want to go around back  marisha yeah sure make sure they dont try and run  travis yeah i knock and say its fjord with the mighty nein open up  matt theres a moment pause and the door opens up very quickly with just enough space to let you in  do you go in  /dung/ travis yeah  matt okay you head inside its dark in there but you have your dark vision so you look around  and it looks like dolan and horris are both in there horris has a candle light with a side hood  thats keeping it contained to a small area dolan goes oh thank god youre okay were trying  we dont know what to do  travis its all right take a breath is there a back door to this place  matt through the bedroom  travis beaus going to be coming around the back make /none/ sure she gets let in  matt okay horris is in the process of taking things and putting them into a sack they are  basically rapidly  travis youre leaving  matt we cant stay here  travis why  matt if they trace anything back to us theyre going to string us up in front of the tower  travis take a deep breath friend listen ulog is dead he sacrificed himself in a very brave  moment he threw himself at the richter threw a gem in her mouth and exploded in a fireball  listen i /none/ think  matt great so now we have a murder on our hands too  travis i think  matt horris goes keep your mouth down please  travis i dont think any of this leads back to us we still have to complete our mission  we got to make sure that lord sutan is implicated in this but right now were clean  matt at this point that doesnt even matter we cant  travis the richters gone you have a chance to ascend to her seat wasnt that the plan  matt yes but if there is /town/ any chance they can bring that back to us maybe we leave town for a  short time maybe just go  travis stop dont be a coward in this moment if you want to help this city if you want to help  make the empire better youre going to have to stand strong a little risk is going to come with  this job especially in that position you knew the risk going into this didnt you to put your  money and your lives at risk  matt make a persuasion check  travis 15  matt /dung/ 15 he goes youre right we should and horris goes no what do you want them to go  ahead and throw us in the dungeon is that what you want i understand what youre saying but  none of us knew that the highrichter was going to be dead im sure they have ways of tracing that  back what good and dolan goes calm down please maybe hes right maybe they dont have a  way to bring it back if we see this through horris takes the satchel and sets it on the table  puts the /none/ candle below it and walks up grabs the side of dolans shoulders and says i  understand but i dont want to lose you and this scares the shit out of me they both take a  moment and look at each other horris looks at you and says i think youre right neither of us  know how to talk our way out of the guards if they come by were not good liars  travis i understand fortunately in this situation you dont have much to lie about you  were here you werent at the richter’s you /none/ werent involved in it in any way the knights of  requital are going to take the fall for this that would be the only tiein ulog is dead  you have a chance to do some real good here  matt horris nods okay then we stay and dolan says no i stay just in case things go wrong i  want you safe and gone if this is to be turned around im the one theyre going to look to i’m  the one who actually has the political influence here im the one who can talk and /none/ make a  difference if that is to be done in the next few days or the next week if you can just for a  while trust me and just leave is that okay he looks to you and horris kind of  fine but ill come back soon  travis well keep an eye out i promise if anything needs to be shared between you can rely  on us to pass a message  matt dolan nods okay im good sorry horris i dont need you for this it would be stupid for  both of us /none/ should anything go wrong to be taken swept up by this okay trust me  travis are you in the house yet  marisha nope im still out back  matt shes still out back  marisha whispers fjord are you dead  travis thats beau  matt horris rushes off and opens the back door  marisha while all this was going on can i do a quick little casing intelligence to see if  theres any thrownaway trash burned evidence or anything in the back  matt make an investigation check  marisha fucking fuck you gil six /none/  travis you love him or you hate him  liam the big bad of campaign two  matt theres piles of trash that are pushed in the corner you look through and you dont find  anything that catches your interest  travis dolan i know horris and you both are worried were still going to need that payment  our efforts have incurred some damages  matt of course i dont have karas but i have ours and i have ulogs he left that with us  before he left tonight  marisha did he let me in /none/  matt yes he let you in at this point horris brought you in he points over too and you can  see theres a smaller sack and a larger one thats more of a backpack that seems to the be one that  ulog left he goes take them please thats of no use to us  at this point horris is letting  beauregard in and knowing that its just the two of you he puts his hand on your shoulder and  says keep him safe get him out if you can please”  travis anywhere you /town/ prefer is there a hiding spot  matt i dont know just out of the city just out of the city for a week thats all i ask  travis fair enough we can do that  matt a cart rolls by and they all get very quiet  marisha theres a little town not far from here called alfield it might actually have use for a  doctor right about now  travis beau has experience with this area  matt maybe okay  marisha wait before you guys leave it doesnt matter based on whats just happened is /none/ there  anything that you guys know that we didnt about any other of the members of the knights of  requital that might have a more invested interest in an invasion or getting back at anyone in the  zauber spire sorry yes that was the right one  matt invasion im confused  travis im afraid ulog may have had a larger game to play  matt horris slaps the shoulder of dolan and says i told you there was something up with that guy  travis why do you say that horris  matt i just didnt /town/ trust him i mean it took a while for us to be okay with each other but he  was always on edge  travis he left us in charge of finding justice for his wife and we intend to  matt thats something  marisha seems like you all had your own individual motives for why you were part of the  knights of requital you sure yours was just because you wanted to be the highrichter  matt anywhere i could help change the law of the town  travis do i believe him  matt make an /none/ insight check  travis 11  matt 11 hard to read but he seems forthright  travis all right lets help horris get out of the city stay low stay here  matt i will thankfully when all this went down we were both in the song and supper so at  least we have an alibi ive just never done something like this before pardon my nerves you  see his hands are literally shaking and you see notice now he is very nervous  travis have a drink it’ll help with that  matt i will he goes /none/ off to the corner and pulls out a small glass bottle of liquor he comes  over and him and horris give a very tight hug to each other and then separate dolan sits down  puts the drink on the table “thank you  travis of course well have to regroup and well get back to you as soon as we can  matt go  travis we leave  matt horris comes with you guys towards the leaky tap you guys make your way to the leaky tap  laura yes we do  taliesin before we go /none/ in were going to go to the basement  matt okay  laura im going to go upstairs to try to talk to claudia  liam i will say that on the walk i would instantly identify the stone  matt okay so you will cast  liam identify  sam the stone  liam from sutans house  matt oh from sutans house i got you yeah here you go a sending stone one of two you do  not know where the other one is  sam oh intrigue  laura like we had like vox machina had /none/  sam who what who are you talking about  laura oh where you speak into it not like where you hold onto it and you transport  matt no not that that was a gate stone this is essentially a means of communicating between two  stones  liam onceaday walkietalkie  laura okay  matt you head down into the basement area beneath the leaky tap once again the guard is pretty  sparse you’ll see one guard walk past but their numbers seem to have been ushered elsewhere in the  city so you make it down /none/ there and you take enough time that you eventually get the lock back  open that you left you head down into basement its exactly how you left it  sam this is the place are you with us  liam yes i am  sam this is the place i was talking to you about the skeleton’s right over there  taliesin i say we put it behind the skeleton  liam i go take a look at this skeleton i would like to try to ascertain how long this fucker has  been here  matt make a /none/ medicine check  liam yeah not great at all like all my skill rolls seven  matt a seven hard to tell i mean just looking at the level of decomposition its been here a while  taliesin do i get anything from it is it a normal human skeleton  travis do i get anything from it you creepy bastard  matt make a medicine check to see if you can ascertain the creature type  taliesin ten  matt it definitely doesnt appear to be anything beyond humanoid the size the shape of the  skeleton its a /none/ standard humanoid skeleton but you’re not able to tell anything beyond that  liam heres the thing we can hide this here its a calculated risk which i am fan of  generally but my thread my magic would let me know if someone no never mind  sam what  liam no i can put a magical lock on the door to this basement as well as well as an alarm  taliesin an alarm and a lock  sam what would that do  liam well the thread will allow me me to know if someone i didnt /none/ want to be in here came in here  distant clattering  matt thats upstairs  laura thats me upstairs talking to claudia  and the spell will stop your average joseph from coming in here  taliesin i like this plan its a good plan  sam all right very smart as always  liam but you know i think you and i should sleep down here tonight actually  sam with the skelly  liam yes  laughter  taliesin i think were going to need you upstairs for some identification i think it would be less  /none/ suspicious sleeping down here  liam i worry well ill tell you my concerns and that is that this thing is beyond  comprehension even and the desire to get it back is going to be great this and i pull out the  sending stone is just a stone that i stole from sutans house this im not worried about would  you put this in your backpack please  laura im not with you im upstairs trying to get a hold of claudia  liam oh you’re not with us ill have to ask jester to put this /none/ in her backpack  taliesin so noted  liam but this thing was worth blowing up a tower for  taliesin and if someone spies on it i dont want them to see you with it  sam if we slept in our rooms  liam you cannot spy on a thing as far as i know you can spy on a place you can spy on a person  taliesin you can spy on anything i imagine i mean its magic right  liam this is why i want the lead box  taliesin is that really going to /none/ work  sam but what if someone breaks in and were here then were attached to these objects i mean ill  sleep down here if you want maybe we can get rid of the skelly first  taliesin it’ll take 20 seconds to get here from the second that alarm goes off  liam all right  taliesin one night  liam okay well let’s hide it  taliesin well  liam ja from normal people i put the same shitty rag on it that was on it before  matt okay make a general survival check to pull /none/ things from the surrounding  liam two plus three that’s five  taliesin can i help with this  matt sure you look at it the job he did and you’re like yeah i can probably do a little better  taliesin yeah i can is this survival seven  marisha always have someone check your work  liam molly and caleb put the skull on top of it together  matt it’s fine essentially you didn’t do a masterful job in completely camouflaging it but  it looks like it’s the rest of the objects that looks dusty and /none/ left there  liam did you say there were crates down here too  matt there were some barrels there was an open crate with nothing in it it’s a dusty unused cellar  taliesin let’s put it behind the skeleton if i came down here i’d look in the crates it’s the  first thing i’d do  liam okay  laura you would oh never mind i’m not there  matt so you hide it up and put it off to the side  taliesin i look in the crate  matt you look in the crate you /none/ look inside and see a fairly rateaten sack of rice grains that  have spilled out  taliesin awesome  matt as well as a lot of rat droppings in the crate it looks like some of the wood at the  bottom has been chewed through as well  laura i’m not there  taliesin nope never mind damn that was good thought though  laura that was a really good thought  matt anything else guys  taliesin thread lock  sam what’s wrong caleb  liam i really think we should stay down here with it  /none/ sam all right i’m game  taliesin one of you if not both of you  liam why don’t you and i stay down here for the night you have anything you want me to identify  leave it i can do that you know what i have i’m not leaving  sam what i mean we don’t know what fjord and the grumpy one have discovered maybe we should go  upstairs and reconnoiter with them and then come down here when it’s time for beddybye  liam i will stay with this thing you go up when they /none/ come back you come back down my gut tells  me to stay close to this thing  sam all right i’ll stay with you then  liam i’m glad  matt all right  taliesin so we’re going to go in and out of this room several times tonight  liam the entrance to this is in the back of the building right  matt it is yes it’s in the alley  taliesin that in no way is suspicious but that’s fine  liam well nott you go up you can just message me  sam oh yes /dung/ i can do that should i do that and then come back later  liam yeah and you come down here  sam you’re just going to stay here in this dank dark room with a skeleton by yourself no dinner  all right  marisha sounds like half the clubs in la  sam all right i’ll be back in less than an hour  travis we got a quesadilla  marisha fuck  all right i’ll go up and see what they are saying  matt while this is happening  liam when they leave i’m going to /none/ take the big item and put it on my person i’m going to hold  it actually  matt okay as you’re holding it there it’s strangely warm to the touch the more time you  spend with it holding it there  liam i am not like looking into the abyss i just don’t understand it and i’m just holding it there  matt yeah  liam okay  matt okay let me see here okay  liam jester had all the shit right  laura i had all the shit  matt yep so you head back up /tavern/ into the leaky tap tavern there’s a handful of patrons a lot of  them are talking or whispering about the events

and knees and try to look can i look under the door  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because you are looking through a tiny little gap  in the floor  taliesin whoa  laura okay well the first one was really good  perception nine  matt nine you see theres light in there and you can see claudia darting back and forth behind her  desk moving very rapidly and with haste is grabbing things and seems to be writing something  feverishly /town/ but you dont actually see her you just see the bottom of her feet moving back and forth  marisha why are so many fucking people trying to skip town  travis shady motherfuckers  laura claudia what are you doing  matt she stops in the space um im  laura is everything okay  matt everythings fine  laura did you see the tower explode  matt i heard about it  laura can you let me in  matt make a persuasion check  travis that cuteness man  taliesin there should be an annoyance check this /none/ is so great  liam give her advantage oh my god  laura 15  matt 15 the door opens up and you can see claudia looking as pristine as ever hair makeup  everything done perfectly come in quickly  laura okay  matt closes the door brings you inside  liam can i come in now  marisha dont take no for an answer  liam how about now  matt i am aware that you and your team were involved in something this evening am i correct  laura well we were at the gala because we /none/ were having some fun  matt but you are not in any way shape or form perhaps doing a burglary and job breaking in for  the knights of requital yes  laura who are that  sam two floors below were putting a skull  laughter  matt make a deception check  travis who are that  laura thats actually a really good deception 21  matt she looks at you confused and goes well regardless your friends are involved in something  that as a precaution as i have been housing certain meetings out of friendship with /tavern/ an  individual there is danger that i might be pulled up in this so i am preparing to sell off the tavern  laura gasps wait a minute but wouldnt that draw attention to the tavern  matt it will only draw attention to me  laura okay  matt she walks over and finishes tidying paperwork on the side  laura who are you selling it to  matt make a general charisma roll just for the hell of it  laura well see this is why i oh no ten  matt ten she goes to a /none/ friend  laura oh friends are good can i have that safe though  matt sighs she kneels down at the side of the room and theres a cloth put over a small table  like an end table and she removes the flowers from it pulls the cloth off and its a safe  laura whats it made out of  matt out of iron what else would you make a safe out of  laura oh okay  matt she pulls out a key and unlocks it brings out a couple of bags of coin brings out a /none/ couple  other bags of something you dont hear any noise the rustling as she pulls it out sets them off to  the side looks at you while she does so the whole time like  laura are those drugs  matt here’s your safe  laura thank you  matt hands it to you its small its heavy but youre pretty strong all right  laura well all right will you be gone in the morning then  matt probably  laura oh no but claudia i really like you  matt well i like you too but /none/ thats okay dont worry the woman im selling this to is also  a very good person and a good friend  laura whats her name  matt theres a brief pause glances over at the paperwork on the table  laura i look down at the paperwork on the table too  matt lauren lauren schvine  laura is that what it says  matt it is  laura giggles okay lauren thats a good name i heard when we were coming back that they were  putting the city on lockdown so if youre going to leave you /none/ should probably do it quickly  matt i appreciate the information i should be okay  laura all right  matt good night  laura good night thank you claudia for all of this  matt not a problem  laura i walk very slowly out of the room and keep looking over my shoulder as im doing it and  smiling back at her  matt she watches and waits sees you smiling arms crossed on the desk patiently waiting  laura okay im going to put this in my room thank you  matt the door closes behind /none/ you and you hear a heavy sigh audibly on the other side of the  door so as the rest of you begin to catch up and gather for the evening were going to take a break  cheering  matt be back here in a few minutes to pick up from that point we do have tonights wyrmwood  giveaway that went all sorts of weird interesting ways oh man  marisha we almost

game you  all begin to converge back in the leaky tap the party has reassembled aside from you who are  staying down in the basement  liam hanging out with my new friend  matt yes  sam yorick  matt as you guys all gather together what do you do  laura are we in a room we should be in a room instead of in the  travis not downstairs  laura yeah  marisha upstairs yeah convene /none/ inroom  taliesin theres money and loot lets take a look  travis convene in the girls room its bound to be cleaner  laura mmhmm  marisha its all right  laura we did have a pillow fight  marisha yeah its down feathers all over the place  matt yeah its pretty blows out lips  sam so weve got some stuff what did we get  laura heavy thud nott what is this made out of  sam this i will taste it i will lick the safe  matt its very irony its like licking a /none/ nine volt battery  laura is it made of lead  sam its ironic its not what we want  laura i really was trying to get a lead box  sam you did very well considering its after midnight and you got a metal box for free  laura its true  sam i dont know can i tell its lead i mean iron not lead  matt make an intelligence check because you are an alchemist ill give you advantage on it  sam okay just a straight intelligence check  matt yep  sam 15  matt /none/ 15 okay yeah this is very definitively iron youve tasted iron iron filings and things  of that similar nature and it has the same twinge to the flavor  sam oh its a very wellmade safe  laura well we can still put stuff in it if we want to  marisha wheres caleb he downstairs  travis yeah where is caleb  sam hes downstairs for now but i am in constant communication with him  marisha whats the last thing he said  sam i take out my piece of wire and i do my incantation and /tavern/ i whisper to it and i say did the  skeleton come to life and kill you please respond to this message  liam everybody is dead down here  sam hes a prankster  laughter  sam hes good ol cay  travis hes down there babysitting our item  sam yeah  travis okay  taliesin were going to want to take a look at these boots these daggers  laura hey claudia was aware that we guys were in league with the knights of requital  marisha makes sense  laura claudia says shes selling the tavern /tavern/  marisha taliesin and travis what  laura yeah like tonight  marisha how much  laura to a girl named lauren spizzick or something  marisha shpizich  travis spinach  sam lauren spinach  laura so she said she was selling it and i said wouldnt that draw attention to the tavern  though and she said no just her but if it does and she knows then maybe it could lead the  guards to us though  sam should we change to a different hotel  laura it might be smart but that might be  /none/ sam wait she was selling this place because of us  matt as a note so you guys recall horris is with you  marisha wait what  laura wait horris came with us  matt horris came along with you guys  travis thats my bad yeah he did  marisha i thought we just sent him on his way  travis yeah we forgot to qualify that  marisha aw fuck i thought  liam make believe is tricky guys  laura horris is in this room right now  matt horris is in the room with you /none/  laura aw come on man  sam i should put on my pants  taliesin lets not be hasty  matt well say for the purposes of this the door now opens to the room and horris comes in  after a drink to steady his nerves and goes hello  marisha did you bring me that drink oh sit down  travis yeah jeez man no sense of humor right now hes in shock all right  marisha sorry  travis horris were going to get you out of the city as soon as possible is there a /town/ destination  you wanted to send him to or point him in the right direction  marisha i was mentioning alfield but really its up to him i guess i dont care  travis have any spots in mind that you can lay low for a while  sam why does he need to leave the city  marisha we walked in on him and his boy trying to skip town  travis they were understandably rattled its understandable but dolans going to try and stay  to make the city a better place horris is going to remove a /town/ bit of the risk for himself for a bit  matt just for a little bit  laura you should go to the coast you should get out of the empire  travis it is lovely by the coast  marisha well he said he only wanted to be gone a week though right  matt about a week or two until things  sam why do you need to leave whos suspicious of you  matt we dont know yet its just a precautionary measure  marisha you do know that leaving town itself is suspicious in its own /none/ right right just throwing  it out there  matt we have an alibi but if we both stay and we get found out we both get arrested  marisha but you have an alibi its hard to have an alibi when you mysteriously  matt what do you want me to do then  marisha i dont give a shit what you  matt she who questions everything and offers no answers what do you want me to do  travis i think what beau is trying to say is that youve made a wise choice in removing yourself /town/ for  a bit did you happen to know the owner of the leaky tap shes apparently selling it  marisha yeah claudia also skipping town  matt i dont blame her either  laura i dont know if shes leaving town shes just selling the tavern  travis shes selling it yeah  marisha she knew we were holding all those backroom meetings right she helps you guys quite  a lot  matt as far as dolan told me yeah  travis did you want to get out of town tonight or did you want to wait until /none/ the morning perhaps  matt i can wait until the morning if you dont mind me crashing with you  travis not at all we have room in molly and is room  sam you can take caleb and my room  laura why are you not going to  sam well be spending the night somewhere else  laura gasps where  taliesin well were not going to speak of that in mixed company but theyre dealing with other problems  travis yeah ill lead horris to our room and let him get comfortable ill be back  liam /none/ just a quick aside while all of this is going on i place the thing in my lap and i pick  up the skull oh so many secrets huh yorick  gravelly maybe you should tear it off your chest  i dont think thats a good idea  its driving you crazy  maybe not yet  its probably a good idea  youre funny  travis gravelly red rum  matt seriously  sam i get to spend the night with that guy  travis yeah youre going down there  matt all right anything else you /none/ want to work out discuss or plan  taliesin lets divvy up the loot ive worked it out thats 19 platinum apiece and two gold  pieces apiece  travis wow fucking pay day  taliesin with two platinum left over  marisha how many platinum 19  taliesin mmhmm  laura thats a lot of platinum  marisha and two gold  taliesin mmhmm  sam ill take calebs share and give it to him  taliesin mmhmm  laura okay so we also got lets look this sword  travis what kind of sword is it  matt /none/ its roughly longsword length it has this curved hooked edge to it the blade looks like it  would not just slash but tear as it went through flesh as well its pretty wickedlooking  laura its pretty wickedlooking  travis does it look like it has any magical aura emanating from it  matt i dont know can you sense magic  travis not officially  matt then you do not know  sam i can take it downstairs later and have caycay take a look at it  travis caycay not to be confused with kiki  marisha /none/ yeah  laura we also have these really super cool spiky boots  travis what do those do  laura i think you put them on your feet and they protect them  travis molly put those boots on  taliesin yeah all right how do they look  matt they look nice  taliesin i think they clash a bit but  laura i dont think they go with your pants  taliesin no not really  travis you get an extra spring in your step whats it do  matt you take a moment and you feel alert /none/  taliesin theyre caffeinated sorry  marisha i didnt expect you to wear platforms  laura its weird to see the bottom of your pants because you normally have those thighhighs on  taliesin oh theyre very comfortable and they keep everything else clean  laura yes okay we also have these three daggers which look like are they ceremonial do  they look  matt they look functional theyre similar in design to the longsword theyre not quite as  intricate and theyre much simpler they dont have the same grooves carved into the hilt and  they look /none/ like fairly decent daggers for either stabbing or throwing  laura i lick one then i lick the safe is it iron then  matt youre not certain what material theyre made from its not the same as the what are you doing  taliesin im playing with the longsword  matt its got a great balance  laura oh and we dont have the armor anymore we gave it back to him  matt yeah the armor you gave back and then was scooped up by the crownsguard  marisha i look at molly and i take out my /none/ bo staff i say parry and i go whack with the  sword see if anything happens  matt okay do you attack him  marisha yeah  matt roll for an attack  marisha i mean i told him i was attacking  taliesin im going to parry  marisha 20 total  taliesin boy that hits  matt you attempt to parry cooly and she hits you in the right eye  taliesin ow  marisha oh sorry i thought we were just wrestling a little  taliesin i hit her with the flat of the blade  /none/ marisha ow fuck  taliesin any effect  marisha do i feel anything  matt pain  sam why dont i just have caleb look  taliesin any effect  marisha yeah a fucking headache  taliesin my god it works its amazing  sam ill take the daggers unless you can use them to throw i can throw them at things i think  marisha do the daggers seem special  matt the daggers seem to be simpler in design youre not sure if theyre special or not i mean  the only person who can detect magic is /none/ not in the room  liam were going to drag this out as long as possible  matt i know  marisha im going to take one of the daggers and i throw it against the windowsill  travis windowseal  sam thats how they say it in kentucky  matt go ahead and roll an attack  travis windowseal  marisha seal damn it thats true what did you say  matt go ahead and roll an attack  marisha singing dont fuck me gil 20 sorry 22  matt 22 yeah vibrating impact it sticks to the bottom /none/ of the sill it doesnt quite hit the  glass it manages to hit its mark and stay there like a dagger  marisha i mean that was pretty awesome right  sam i think that was more you than the dagger though  marisha thats true  travis why are yall staying in another place tonight  sam for safety  travis oh because of the thing  sam loudly yes because of  matt horris isnt in the room anymore  sam oh all right  laura you take your pants back off  sam yeah because of /none/ the thing calebs idea  travis you need any help backup  sam im the help  travis right  marisha i think what fjord meant was can yall be trusted  laura exactly will you send a message to caleb and say are we going to leave everyone else  tonight and steal the big ball send a message to him saying that  marisha very valid question  sam all right sure i take out my wire i do my incantation i send a message to him i say  caleb are we going to abscond with the /none/ dodecahedron in the dead of night you can reply  to this message and only i can hear your reply  liam tell them im not going to run off with it  sam yes we are  laura damn it  travis nott why why are you going to  sam were not going to steal it hes scared of that thing why would we take it away from you  marisha seems like hes taken a few things that hes afraid of  travis yeah to be honest that evening started to take a turn before the richter /none/ showed up do  you know caleb to be stickyfingered like yourself  sam we do what we need to do to survive  marisha wait what happened  travis well remember we were trying to leave no trace caleb was the architect of the plan and  there was a scroll that looked like it might have some magic to it and he wanted to take it with  sam so what the plan was to leave no trace not take nothing he was very clear at the outset  that we were doing this for money  marisha /none/ you do realize that missing things mean leaving a trace right  sam no  travis we were right there at the end we were at the finish line  sam we caused a giant explosion we destroyed a rug we broke into two different places mollymauk  was seen by guards outside of both there was plenty of traces we left behind i opened a box  that froze me for an hour  laura i know and i saved you  sam yeah im pretty sure someones going to notice that that box has been opened  marisha /none/ you realize youre not helping your case right  sam im just saying him taking a scroll is small potatoes  marisha we’d already fucked up the rug we probably shouldnt fuck up anyone elses house we  were already implicated at one place right  travis nott its just a little reckless wouldnt you say  sam what caleb does is well thoughtout and always intentional and smart  taliesin youre a remarkable judge of character you know that  marisha are you aware of what stockholm syndrome is  sam stockholm syndrome  marisha yeah  sam no /none/ im not explain that to me  marisha yeah its an emon thing  matt gerald stockholm  sam what are you implying  taliesin i think what beau is trying to imply is im going to use something a little more  basic do you know the story of the scorpion and the turtle  sam sure the scorpion rides on the turtles back  taliesin and then what happens  sam whatever caleb says happens next  laughter  taliesin the scorpion rides on the turtles back across a river the scorpion stings the turtle  they both /none/ drown what is the moral of this story  laura dont be a scorpion  sam stay away from the water is what i take from it  taliesin thats true but the full point of this and the point im trying to make is that with a  group like this with very untrustworthy people youve got to trust each other because you have  to trust somebody you cant trust not anybody because youre just alone  sam all right so you are all apologizing for not trusting calebs judgment  taliesin we dont trust you  laura /none/ i trust you  taliesin youve tried to steal from us twice  sam not you  taliesin youve tried to steal from us not me us this is where the circle has to start  we will support you in doing some ridiculous stuff but you have to keep it outside  travis were looking out for you i mean  taliesin and that means sometimes you cant do the thing you want because its going to be better  for everybody else and sometimes everybody else is wrong but you have to go with it  sam all /none/ right and what exactly have you done to earn our trust  taliesin nothing theres been no earned trust  laura i saved you  taliesin i actually did take a crossbow bolt knocked myself unconscious trying to save your life  sam im not talking about life or death  taliesin i saved your life  marisha it doesnt matter wait  taliesin and it doesnt matter we start from scratch this is where it starts  sam ive saved your lives caleb has saved your lives  taliesin when  sam tonight caleb got that dodecafuckballs out of /none/ there by himself  taliesin we didnt want it  marisha okay hang on before we turn this into a pissing contest  sam he has slain things he has saved things and i have as well if were talking about trust what  on earth have any of you people done to earn our trust what have you done that we have requested ever  laura i let you have a ring  sam i like you  marisha its not about earning each others trust look i have worked with some skeevey  motherfuckers in my day very /none/ unsavory types but you know what i trust that they have their own  selfpreservation right so i can trust that these motherfuckers dont want to get caught and  that they dont want to die at the end of the day if you want to do something skeevey on the side  let me know i will help you out but when we are all working as a team i dont want your actions  to get me in fucking trouble  taliesin so if you really dont trust us ill happily take that 40 platinum back right now /none/  marisha we dont have to trust each other but when we are working on a job together i want to  know that you care enough about yourself that youre not going to get me in trouble  taliesin god youre making me agree with her  marisha fuck you molly  taliesin and marisha fuck you  taliesin see  sam when we signed up for this job caleb was very explicit he said we are doing this for coin  and treasure and thats what we got  marisha i agree with that  sam there was /none/ no surprises here were in it for what we can grab for ourselves  taliesin no were in it for what we can all grab together thats how these things work  marisha when you want to grab something for yourself you let me know and you go grab it for  yourself i dont have to be a part of it when we choose one objective together i can only trust  that you are in it with us we can be selfish as a group and then be selfish as individuals  taliesin this is why the circus /none/ worked this is why the circus was functional  travis you know nott you count on caleb to keep you safe right to achieve greater things than  you by yourself can achieve think how many things you could do with all of us by your side im not  saying you dont have to be selfish and im not saying that you cant go after treasure and coin  sam i think theres a bit of a misconception here  travis okay  marisha is there  sam caleb and i have a very special relationship it is that /none/ of a parent and a child but i am the  parent you do understand that correct i protect him hes my boy and i keep him safe i want  him to thrive and get better and better and more powerful and stronger because he can achieve  great things when i found him he was nothing he was a scared little boy in the corner of a jail  cell as we have gotten more comfortable he has gotten more comfortable and come out of his shell  its my job to protect him because i love him /none/ and i am his protector not because he protects me  taliesin so do you think it would be a good idea to explain to him that he almost got himself  killed tonight turning on a bunch of people he was working with he almost got himself killed tonight  for nothing  marisha youre not the only one who can have the same interests in keeping each other safe  taliesin and youre not nearly as smart as you think you are  travis if i may thank you for sharing that nott  marisha oh yeah thanks /none/  laura that is so cute  sam hes going to be a great man someday  laura he will he really will  travis that changes things i admit that i had the wrong idea about you two i know what its  like to feel responsible for someone  marisha man super shame that calebs not here for this entire conversation  taliesin i try not to have ideas about people they just get in the way  laura i just want to go down there and hug him  taliesin if you do bring all of this /none/ stuff so he can actually do something useful  marisha lets go down there why dont we camp in the cellar  sam that seems like it would be suspicious  taliesin no he created this situation im all right with this  laura does he know that you think of him like his son  sam i dont know that  taliesin well we get to tell him now dont we  laura no we cant out her like that  travis nott we want to take care of caleb we do we pulled him out of that house /none/ when that  fireball went off we didnt cut and run even though it might have saved our skins we care  about you two i hope in time youll learn to trust us just a little bit more maybe think about  protecting us as well because you seem to do a great job taking care of caleb  taliesin and stop expecting people to earn things you just have to sometimes go with it  sam ill have a talk with him  travis i appreciate that  marisha i mean not as nice as what they said /none/ if he ever does anything to get me fucking locked up  i will beat him so fucking bad his ancestors on the next plane wont fucking recognize him  sam thats very nice beau  marisha thanks im trying real hard  sam yeah i could tell that there was at least six more fucks in there that you held back  laughter  sam thats progress  marisha yeah progress i am an hr liability  liam what about in the game  travis so when are you planning to go down to keep an eye on your /none/ boy  sam as soon as you give me the stuff you want identified and youll have to trust me that we  wont run away with it in the dead of night  laura oh now i feel like you really will because everyone was just mean  taliesin we literally caught you stealing our stuff heres an extra platinum  sam hey youre the one who hypnotized me into talking about stuff  taliesin i did  sam yeah you think thats what friends do to each other  taliesin when they catch them stealing their stuff yes /none/ they do  sam i dont think so you think thats cool beau  marisha you caught him stealing your stuff  laura and sam and taliesin her  marisha you caught her stealing your stuff  taliesin fjords stuff technically  sam i was not stealing i was searching for something to steal  taliesin she was stealing  laura what were you trying to find  sam thats besides the point  taliesin here you can cast friends on me ill tell you everything you want to know  sam i dont have friends he hasnt taught me /none/ that one yet  taliesin oh gods suddenly im compelled to answer everything truthfully oh no more of  whatever youre drinking i cant help stop ack  marisha this is the most ive liked either one of you motherfuckers  taliesin i feel that  travis nott how about you take those items to caleb and call it a vote of confidence  taliesin there was an extra platinum in there  sam all right  marisha and i pull out my bo and i put it down and i say but ill find ya if anything else happens /tavern/

dont break into our room ill go down with caleb  matt caleb as /none/ youre sitting there talking to your skull  liam oh that was so brief that was like five minutes ago  matt the door opens and nott scuttles in closes the door behind and comes and joins you  liam hows it going up there  sam i stole this fucking scroll for you  liam its a scroll case right  matt which one are you handing him  sam the one from the richter’s  matt thats right yeah  sam i got it i went back and got it  liam does anybody know you took this /dung/  sam no  liam i set it on the ground i pull nott closer to me and i give nott a kiss on the forehead  thank you  sam thank you for saving me tonight you brought me back from the dead oh i think you used a  potion on me didnt you  liam yeah  sam here take one of mine i have two its okay  liam you are too kind to me  sam of course you keep me safe  liam well you know i think maybe you have guessed it before /none/ now but i care a great deal  for you and that is no small gift thank you  sam thank you we lived huh  liam another day you know a little bit of me is worried that this scroll case will explode so i  think we should check that out first  sam the folks upstairs gave me some more things for you to check out as well are these things you  can do  liam yeah okay i can get this done in about an hour i think first nott will you take the  /none/ scroll case and put it on the other side of the room  sam okay  liam yeah im tapped so this is all ritual spells now so i will use a ritual spell to  identify the scroll case  matt okay the scroll case is a scroll case it does have a faint magical element to it the  limits of what identify can  liam how big is this room down here  matt id say its about eight by 12  liam okay  marisha so smaller than this  liam this is going to be /none/ funny i take another ten minutes to summon schmidt  sam oh  liam come with me outside okay  sam all right  liam okay schmidt go open the scroll case come on i shut the door  matt okay you both back out close the door  sam explosion oh no  matt you hear boom  liam that is what i was afraid of  sam oh shit was it loud enough that anyone else could hear  matt you dont know  travis are you fucking serious  marisha did any of us hear it from /tavern/ the second floor  matt everyone else make a perception check please  taliesin natural 20  travis natural one  laura ten  marisha 13  matt you hear a slight shift in the ground  sam it was that agoura hills earthquake  matt exactly  laura did you just fart  taliesin you would think so but no i think theyre doing something  marisha what  taliesin i heard something  marisha are they trying to fucking escape  travis im just eating bar popcorn  taliesin it sounded like a thump  marisha a fucking /dung/ thump  laura that doesnt sound like an escape  matt everythings messy  laura i hope theyre not dead  taliesin yeah thats something we can find out in the morning  laura does our room look down onto the alleyway  matt your room does not no  liam so at this point back up a little bit and i open the door and back up to see what i see  sam smoke  matt a purplish dark fume wafts out  liam i back away from it  matt you back away from it and it /none/ dissipates over the next 30 or so seconds you keep watch to  see if anybody else notices and it doesnt it rises up and thankfully by the time it would hit  the roof as a smoke beacon it mostly has dissipated enough in the sky where it doesnt  cause a column of visible darkness the edge that youre catching of it the little bit thats  wafting through has this very fine metallic smell to it almost the brief bit that catches your nostrils  you feel your sinuses open up very abruptly and like a mouth /none/ full of wasabi its like coughing  eventually it clears out and you walk inside  liam so not a ball of fiery death  matt no not a ball of fiery death  liam okay so its cleared away schmidts gone i assume  matt schmidt is  liam well if it wasnt damagedealing hes still there  matt it might have been damagedealing  sam i forget how this works does he have your hit points  matt unseen servant  liam he has two one or two  marisha he has the hit points of a kitten /none/  liam one hit point  matt oh yeah schmidt is gone the scroll case is open  liam okay so its clear next ritual spell that i will cast i will gather the other items except  for the dodecahedron  sam was there anything in the box  liam well were about to find out the dodecahedron is in my satchel at this point i  push all the other items towards the case and whatever is there and i use ritual magic to  cast detect magic everywhere i just cast it  matt both of the /none/ scrolls emanate you see within the scroll case theres now two rolledup scrolls  inside there and they emanate a magical aura the longsword emanates a magical aura the boots  emanate a magical aura and your satchel is almost distracting the vibrancy of the magical source  from that object the crystallooking object  liam i rearrange my satchel so its back by my butt so i dont have to look right at it okay  we have a little bit of work to do i pick up the scrolls and examine them  matt okay  travis yeah /none/  liam gasps  travis what the fuck  marisha what why are you getting teary what is happening  sam its a good spell  marisha was it that good  liam come here come here  sam what did we get  liam i pick her up and i hug her  sam what did we get what did we get  liam this will be good for the group this will be good for you and me this is good its  something that i was not able to do ive been trying to figure it out /none/ for months and i have not  been able to figure it out and now i have it  sam yes  liam okay lets look at these things for everybody else okay ho ho ho lets identify  all this shit i spend the next 40 or so minutes  sam sinterklaas  marisha santa klaus  liam ah yeah  sam oh and these daggers too  liam beau might like these these are good yeah these are good okay so all right well put  these away this is a very good blade this might be a /none/ good blade for you why dont you hold on to  it you hold onto that  sam its a longsword  matt its a longsword  sam can i use that  liam oh let me see i thought that was the daggers  sam fake crying  liam so the daggers are not magic  matt the daggers are not magic  liam not magic  matt they are just base daggers  liam no this is bigger than you  sam too big for me i know my limits  liam fjord or molly would like this /none/ they can decide they can decide i mean really these  boots are good for anybody these are good for yeah  laura just tell us what they are just say it out loud just say it  liam no ill tell you on christmas morning and not before  laura youre killing me  liam we couldnt do this at all last campaign now you have to wait 20 minutes  matt its true  laura groans i wonder if i have identify i could take  taliesin theres a way to do it  sam well should we /none/ go to sleep  liam oh boy  sam oh heres your 19 platinum and your two gold and one extra platinum for some reason as  if that were supposed to smooth things over oh and also they dont trust us they think we need  to cooperate more theyre trying  marisha oh  travis nope youre not there  marisha fuck  sam they are very upset  marisha im not im speaking as myself  matt and laura shushing  sam they were very upset that we tried to take the scroll box  liam why /none/  sam because they are in the firm belief that it would have left some sort of clue that would have  led the authorities to us by stealing something after we had broken into two houses stolen other  things torn up a rug  liam that is the red flag not the arcane rug that was destroyed and removed covering his  precious things not jester disguising herself as the highrichter  sam not stealing the seal  liam and leaving witnesses who had seen someone who was not the richter going in before the richter  sam /none/ sure also she was dressed as the richter not wearing the correct outfit  liam yeah ulog rifled through her desk and took some papers from there but i did not see fjord  tear him a new asshole  sam sure but they are under the impression that and this a fair point that we are not very  communicative or we dont behave as much as part of a team as they would prefer i said that i  would tell you and discuss and so thats where it stands with the weirdos  liam well you know /none/ i want this to work so whatever they need i definitely do not agree but  whatever makes it work  sam i think what would make it work is letting them take the lead a bit and following  liam well i have no interest in being a leader do you  sam oh no not at all  liam no  sam but we can just see how it goes playing ball i suppose  liam do you know that i was going to go to that school one day  sam the soltryce academy thing  liam /town/ yeah didnt work out  sam what you didnt get in  liam oh i didnt get anywhere near it im from a small town and there was a lot of hubbub for  me and maybe you know a gatheringup of coin but i fucked it up  sam did you do something wrong or bad  liam whispers yeah  sam you dont have to tell me what it was or what you did but is it something that you can be  forgiven for  liam clears throat that is not for me to say but i /none/ have no interest in going i will do it on  my own correction i will learn with your help  sam our own academy  liam thats the idea ja  sam all right itll take a little longer probably im not a good teacher  liam yeah well you know anything worth going after takes some elbow grease and hard work so  sam all right well ill help wherever i can i do enjoy seeing you get new spells and new skills  liam i havent had a friend in a very long time the last few /none/ months have been unexpected  sam i think for me too ive had more people throw rocks at me than conversations and its  nice you know what its nice with them too they dont seem to mind that you know my teeth  are a little people find that offputting sometimes  liam i do not and ill tell you another secret i like them too i get that theyre angry i  dont agree with them but i get it  sam well theyre not as smart as you are so  liam or you i would argue /none/  sam thats nice  liam well you want to bed down with a terrifying artifact of awesome power  sam i prefer the skeleton actually  liam okay  sam ill go on that side of the room  liam okay  matt all right  liam night nott  sam night caleb  matt all right so as you guys all come to sleep for the evening first off well consider this  rest the milestone where you all hit level four  cheering  matt so if you guys have decided on your adjustments in advance you /none/ can do that  sam how do you do this on dd beyond  matt while you guys figure that out if i could have everybody but caleb leave the table please  laura and sam surprised sounds  sam oh no  liam get out of here  marisha what is happening to you now  travis yes  sam im in the room  marisha are we doing the level four thing now  laura so were doing it  marisha are we doing the level four thing or we doing it after  travis just wait  /none/ matt just set up your stuff except for your hit points well roll those when you get back  marisha okay  travis pick up and walk  laura okay okay okay  sam where do we go  laura this way  taliesin were going this way  laura bye caleb  travis i have to say it because taliesin said it whispers dont die  sam bring your dice so we can roll  liam i love you guys i dont mean the mighty nein youre assholes but i love you guys  marisha ill kill you in /dung/ your sleep okay bye  laura you dont roll a d20 for hit points sam  marisha grab all the dice grab all the dice  laura im grabbing my bag  matt dont roll hit dice roll hit points when you come here  sam how do you play dungeons  dragons  matt you wont need dice youre fine  liam we did it we reclaimed our dignity we did it  matt we did it totally so as the dark takes your dreams sleep brings calm brings peace brings  rest theres a soft hum that seems /dung/ to radiate around you a welcoming softness a light not  quite white not quite dark its a grayish familiar light strangely you feel it pull you  forward through stars the distant night sky you see beacons of light coast by you  see a dark sphere before you then theres a flash of light and youre standing there and youre  holding the object in your hand which you keep its welcoming you look into it for a moment and  look ahead and you see yourself and you see another self and you see another self and /none/ a  fourth caleb and a fifth caleb and an endless row of calebs all slightly different all begin  walking in different directions at once you look down at the object and back up again and theyre  all gone you see a distant flame flicker you feel yourself hypnotized by its movement you look  down again at it and theres something wonderful and ancient about this thing you cant  grasp it its scale is both too large and too small the more your mind tries to make sense of  it the more you feel yourself /none/ walking in 17 different directions at once all those calebs you  saw before are all within you and theyre all pulling at different sides and it confuses you it  scares you for a moment but once again you focus back on this object and the warmth is comforting  you look up again at the stars theyve stopped passing by theyre held in place and for the  first time in a long time you feel at peace thats the end of your dream all right lets  bring everybody else back in please you wake up in /dung/ the cold dark basement of this relatively  unused cellar beneath the leaky tap come to consciousness with the most restful nights sleep  youve had in a long time it feels almost you look over at nott curled up right against your  thigh like a dog asleep come on in  laughter  sam i got scared of the skeleton so i came over here  matt laughs all right so first off lets go ahead and get a roll of hit points here so we have  laura oh gosh  matt we havent done this live /none/ on air before  liam oh man here comes my extra one hit point  sam that was like two minutes  laura we had no time  sam we had no time to do anything  matt thats okay so go ahead and roll as a general rule i reroll ones for hit points  because nothing sucks more for a character than leveling up and rolling a one so now two is the  new sucky baseline so go around the table you are rolling for hit points first fjord  travis oh okay a d8 right  /none/ matt d8 for the warlock yes  travis seven  matt seven nice  marisha d8 for the monk as well a four right down the middle  matt there you go  marisha plus my con modifier yeah  matt plus your con modifier yes  travis yeah really con modifier  matt yeah every level thats how its always been  travis i just forget 11 points  matt caleb d6  liam plus my con modifier its a total of six so im sitting at a big 25 now  matt okay  sam i roll a /none/ d8  matt for you yes i believe its a d8  laura whoa nice  sam eight  matt nice all righty  sam when i leveled up it already gave me two extra hit points why  laura because thats your modifier  matt thats your modifier  sam okay so now i add the extra eight  matt you add the eight to it yeah it automatically adds your level up to that roll yours  laura aw three  matt there you go  taliesin d10 no con modifier  matt no you get con modifier /none/  taliesin okay  matt every class gets a con modifier to hit points  taliesin all right six  matt there you go  sam oh my god i just got ten extra hit points  laura thats amazing  matt all righty  laura i feel like that was really bad that was a really bad roll  matt its okay sometimes you get better rolls than others  sam no shes dead now  matt laughs if you dont roll at least four hit points you die in your sleep  laura yes thats the rule  /none/ matt if you die in the levelup you die in real life all right so anyway continuing the hit  points are the main thing and your abilities we can keep tabs on that if it comes into play and  we can define stuff after the episode tonight but anyway as you all come to consciousness in the  morning the day is before you what do you wish to do  travis im going to see horris  matt horris is already awake and looking out the window and looks nervously  travis horris do you need an /town/ escort out of town or do you think you can find your way  matt i mean an escort would be nice just to have somebody i can work with in case things go bad  travis of course have much coin do you have on you  matt on me 20 gold  travis oh youll be fine  matt its enough to last me a while yeah  travis molly molly  taliesin huh  travis wake up i think im going to escort horris out be back as fast as i can  taliesin all right well /town/ wait for you  travis all right  taliesin im going to wake up and go see what the girls are doing  matt okay you guys get to get your breakfast started and such you guys begin to walk heading  southward since that was where the alfield suggestion was making your way the general  bustle is still happening theres still not a lot of crownsguard on the street corners youre used  to seeing them posted at and as you make your way towards the southern portion of the interstead  sprawl to the southern gate you /none/ can see why the exit gates are swarming with crownsguard the  portcullis is down with the smaller side doors open and every person who enters and exits is  being interviewed and being checked as to whether or not theyre allowed to leave it seems that  lockdown is very serious during this investigation horris immediately clamps up and  grabs your arm and goes i don’t i dont know  travis stay casual stay calm just turn and were going to slowly start walking back just act normal  matt okay you both slowly make your way through /town/ that intersection and back and no one  seems to pay much mind theyre consumed with the current hustle and bustle at the gate as you guys  are walking back horris is like is there another  way out is there someone something you know  travis there always is and if all else fails theres the sewers youre not opposed to getting  a little dirty to get out of town are you  matt no no no  travis well want to wait until we have more of the others just in case im afraid the sewers /none/  might be being cased as well so stay put for a little while longer well find you a quiet spot  in the leaky tap but let me check with the others  matt okay okay all right as you guys are getting the rest of your morning on what do you  want to do  laura get the rest of my morning on  matt getting your morning on  taliesin im going to point out because i took tough  matt oh yeah all right  taliesin so im at 49 hit points  sam ooh /none/  matt damn dude  sam that’s a lot  taliesin but now i burn through more to use my swords  sam do we have to find dolan now  travis no we found dolan last night hes going to stay put in his house low were going to try  and assure that hes safe so that he can you know put his name up for that highrichter seat  marisha weve got to figure out what were doing with this thing  travis but listen the gates its not a joke its sealed there are crownsguard swarming /none/ all  over it it seemed like they were doing personal interviews patdowns the whole smash so even an  enchantment might not hold up to scrutiny  laura wasnt there a woman who was also whispers part of the knights of requital  marisha yeah kara  laura what happened to her  marisha she was the most shifty bitch  travis we didnt see her last night she wasnt at dolans  laura but she saw you guys  travis well she saw yes she did  laura at one of the meetings  travis yeah  marisha /none/ she never said a whole lot  laura if anyone is going to turn us in it would be her  travis perhaps  marisha shes the one i arguably know the least about  laura wheres horris maybe he knows something about her  matt you look behind fjord at this point and in the doorway is horris arms crossed biting his  lower lip  laura horris  matt yes  laura do you know where kara is  matt i honestly dont we scattered when the preparations were done to make sure we were far  apart /tavern/ so we couldnt be traced together  laura do you know where she lives  matt i dont actually  laura do you know what she does  matt she says she occasionally works out of that really terrible bar the evening  laura the evening nip she works at the evening nip  matt i dont go there  laura okay  sam weve got to get our nip on ooh wait maybe not  marisha well jester and i know the code to talk to the gentleman if we ever want to do that  travis indeed i /none/ was thinking that we might try and get horris out now that way if a crownsguard  finds its way here maybe we should take him into the sewers get him out of the city  laura do the sewers lead out of the city  travis i imagine  marisha generally when a city is on lockdown though the sewers is the first place that guards  are looking for shady people to leave  matt thats true  marisha wheres our cart we still have our gypsy wagon  sam oh god we havent fed the horses in /none/ days  marisha no we havent  laughter  matt the horses are being taken care of the horses will be fine the manticore head though  thats probably a whole different order of business  laura the manticore head oh i bet it smells so bad  sam so we left the horses at a stable or something okay theyre not dead in an alley  somewhere  laura oh god  taliesin trying to rip the cart off the dead horses  matt oh excuse me  marisha is our cart in the city or is it outside /none/ the city  matt no you brought it in the city with you  marisha we can bury him under a pile of produce or something like that try and sneak him out of  the city  taliesin i think we would need a proper smuggler for that  travis indeed  taliesin a wellbuilt cart with a secret compartment  sam get a big catapult and just  matt do you know a smuggler  taliesin no i dont know a smuggler i dont know anybody in this city  sam wait we know a smuggler  laura /none/ yeah we do know a smuggler  sam who was the guy who first showed us around the city  laura ulysses ulysses stanneras  taliesin oh god  sam yeah  laura he was in that yellow cloak remember  marisha also you know who we havent checked up on bryces sister right her sister  sam their sister  marisha their sister sorry bryces sister  sam i totally forgot about that  travis i did too  sam and also theres the gentleman and also we need a lead box oh my god theres so much to /none/ do  laura we need a lead box should we go try to buy a lead box  sam or maybe pumat would have some sort of a magicalencasing  laura but how would we tell him why we need it  sam he doesnt care does he  laura dont you think somebody would be asking who recently bought something that would protect  against scrying  travis horris we obviously have a lot to decide on perhaps it would be better if you stayed up in  the room  matt i can do that ill lock myself /none/ in there and let me know if anything comes up  taliesin we have some reading if you like im going to grab the copy of tusk love  laughter  taliesin try and relax but not too much  matt all right horris gives you a long look of ive learned a lot about you in the moment  laughter  sam we should write tusk love and sell it on the store  matt im sure the community is already halfway there buddy laughs all right so horris is  taken care of for the moment whats the /tavern/ plan  marisha is broken veil the name of a tavern here or was it in alfield  matt the broken veil  laura i know i wrote it down  marisha i think i messed up and i wrote down where she is but i dont know where  laura im trying to find where i wrote down bryces connections i think i wrote it down in a  different  marisha no wait  sam was he in alfield she they were they in alfield  marisha yes bryce is in alfield  sam bryce fayled felllid feelid /none/  marisha yeah feelid bryce feelid watchmaster bryce feelid elf leader of the guard very sweet  person these are all the things i wrote down  travs great notes jesus  matt laughs  travis “very sweet person”  marisha bryce despises the dwendalian empire thinks they get no support being so far south from  the dwendalian empire hes not from this region and then i wrote down ‘broken veil’ and ‘bluffs’  laura so its got to be that  matt okay so yes i know what youre talking about now thank you for the headsup on /none/ that so  the broken veil bluffs is to the far far east that is where the border of the dwendalian empire  and xhorhas is its actually where most of the conflicts happen its where the garrisons exist  where most of the army is sent to defend the empire in the valley  travis level four lets go  laughter  matt you are ready for this shit  laura the radiation area in fallout its like get out get out now  marisha youre unprepared  travis computer voice you are leaving the combat area  marisha /none/ so i didnt i dont have the name of her damn  matt their  marisha their damn sister  laura and i cant find it in these notes either shit  sam if caleb was in the room when bryce said it then caleb would know  marisha i think caleb was because it was right when we said we were going to zadash and bryce was  like go look at this person sorry i choked on my spit  matt bryce was the one that sent you to the leaky tap bryce is the one that sent /none/ you to claudia  laura yes  marisha wait is claudia his sister  matt no  marisha am i going around in circles  matt i think youre going in circles  sam there was no sister  matt i dont recall there  laura being a sister it was claudia  sam well if matt doesnt recall the sister then it was claudia  marisha it was claudia was it claudia this whole time  matt i was like what did i say about bryces sister oh shit  marisha it was claudia never mind  sam mystery /town/ solved  laura no wonder i dont have it in my notes  matt there you go once again  sam we did it  laura we figured it out  travis chats like fucking idiots  matt if i did say sister remind me  sam well that takes one thing off the list we still need the lead box get horris out of town  the gentleman what else  travis the leaky nip whats it called  laura the evening nip  sam thats the gentleman also  matt the leaky nip  laura thats going to /none/ be me in a few months  taliesin bam bam  matt thats a different establishment  laughter  taliesin thats a daycare  liam wow this aint your kids dd right there  sam the leaky nip i mean the evening nip should we go there  laura no we need a lead box thats probably more important  marisha and get horris out first right  travis pumats got to have a  laura or a blacksmith i feel like a blacksmith would be more  sam he was telling us about blacksmiths before theres the spark hammer /none/ smith we could go to the  spark hammer smith in the pentamarket  laura yeah lets go to that  travis have we been there yet  sam i think we actually have been there before  laura yeah that was the first place we went  sam yannick jan  matt caleb  liam

work out for you anyway  travis i know magic some  sam im a student of magic  travis not enough dm says  matt its not about not enough its placement and what you have and where you are so what are  you guys doing  sam were going to /none/ go to the spark hammer smiths smithys  marisha yannick and jan  matt you find your way there yannick is inside currently working on hammering out the edges of a  piece of armor hello can i help you  laura yes do you make anything out of lead  matt i mean i certainly can depends what youre hoping to have made  laura could you perhaps make me a really pretty so my mother is a big fan of things made out of  lead she said she likes the color of that metal  matt thats /none/ a very curious liking but sure ill take it  laura she gets a lot of things in gold and stuff and so she says that lead looks very  different from that and she thinks its pretty  matt hey im not judging  laura so i want to make her a really pretty jewelry box out of lead  matt the halfling scratches his temple and goes well i mean if youre willing to pay i can make it  laura okay its like she has a lot of jewelry so something like around this big  matt /none/ its going to be a lot of lead and a few days to make it  sam can it just be leadlined is that a thing  liam it can be thin as a sheet of parchment  laura oh so not a whole lead box maybe like a box made out of wood and then pretty lead on the inside  matt that theres a little more easy  to put together  laura or maybe on the outside so she doesnt realize its not made of lead  liam it doesnt need to be as am i here /none/ ive been doing this with my spells  matt thats up to you sure  liam it needs to be sealed all the way around and be able to close  laura hes a good friend of my moms  matt right  sam everybody knows her mom  matt okay we’ll go ahead and get started on that there full cost to you two days work materials  thatll run you back about one and a half gold one gold five silver  laura i think that is acceptable yes  matt all right  laura here will you /none/ also engrave it with love you so much  matt itll be an additional silver  laura okay  matt all right come back here in about 48 hours should be good  laura okay if we give you more could you make it faster  matt i could certainly do my best  laura i noticed they’re blocking up the gates and i need to get it to her because her birthday’s  coming up  matt i am but one small halfling so you’re going to have to wait one way or the other  laura all right /none/  matt sorry  laura okay thank you  matt no worries mate come back then  marisha our blacksmith is taika waititi so into it  liam are we all in a group though sorry i really did have my head up the ass of level four  matt you guy haven’t said you’ve split so i imagine you’re all as a group  laura that’s a couple days  liam okay  laura should we check with pumat sol and see if he has something like that  liam like a lead i would pay premium price to /none/ get a hold of a lead box right away  marisha you all keep talking about this pumat sol guy  travis have you not been to the invulnerable gentleclerk  marisha no i don’t do the magic stuff i tend to do other things  liam yeah but this is more like an experience like sleep no more you have to go and  marisha oh really  liam yeah you have to see it for yourself we do have a lot to do but this is a functional trip as well  taliesin i’m normally not impressed by /none/ eccentrics so this is really impressive  liam this is a functional trip as well a gentleman like pumat sol gentlemen like pumat  sols would most likely because they understand divination and the needs of the arcane  marisha see it feels like an inside joke  taliesin it is  liam we want you to be in on it  laura he would be more aware of what were asking for if we asked for it as opposed to the  blacksmith  liam yeah he would not be surprised by the question  laura okay  liam /none/ also come over here please  laura just me  liam well whoever everybody hears this come closer yeah so  travis belches loudly  laughter  matt my hair went wind sounds on that one  liam i look around to see if anyone was distracted by fjord’s large belch  matt at the moment no it seems to be a common thing here in the pentamarket  liam all right i know you’re all a big fan of my sticky fingers i took this from sutan’s house  sam what is that what does it do  laura /none/ what is it  liam it is a sending stone its a communication device this was in sutan’s house this was under  the rug that we destroyed and removed  laura that attacked us you mean  liam yes of course we did what we had to do we improvised like fjord told me the other day you  have to improvise this stone has a twin somewhere and we can talk with it i don’t know who it is  honestly my opinion is the probability of someone trying to find us searching for this  thing is /none/ like looking for a needle in a haystack in a newly made warzone however in the meantime  i was wondering if you’d hold it inside of your fancy bag because  laura will they be able to find it through the fancy bag  liam i believe not because inside your bag is somewhere else it is not even on this plane  laura i hold it up to my ear is anybody trying to talk to me right now  matt not at the moment  liam let’s put that in your bag right away because  we /none/ don’t know what’s on the other side of it  laura how do we oh okay can they hear me talking to it right now  liam there is a very very small chance the answer  is yes so please put it in your bag right now  marisha so you started stealing stuff in the first house  liam yeah that is what i said that i was going to do  travis to be fair he did say that  taliesin we had the talk i’m willing to let it slide  marisha we had the talk /none/ with her  taliesin that’s fair ah sword boots daggers  laura wait don’t pass it out out here  taliesin oh not right here of course  liam do we want to do it before pumat or after pumat  laura before  sam one little interjection couldn’t we use the sending thing to find out information if we sent a  message  liam all we could do is say hello to a stranger we don’t know who it is  laura would it hear our voice or would it   liam it would hear our voice /none/  sam we could disguise our voice and say we’ve been made send instructions and find out what  happens  liam that is true just keep it in the bag for now just in case  marisha that’s pretty good though  liam yeah we could certainly roll this over in our minds and see if there’s something we could do  with it if someone is going to look for this thing and again probability very low but if  they were going to look it’d be right away it’d be a couple of weeks  laura what /none/ if we say to it hey man we found this stone on the ground who do you belong to  what do you think  taliesin i think that’s it could be dangerous it’s better if they initiate because then we learn  information immediately  sam sometimes if you scroll through and find a listing for mom  laura i know and then you call the mom  liam i believe possible that at some point a message could come through it  taliesin that’s what i was thinking  liam but we don’t know i just want for /none/ the next two to four weeks i would prefer to keep it  either in a leadlined container or in that bag chances are small but if someone was really determined  laura okay  liam it’s possible  laura all right its in the bag  travis pumat or the rest of the equipment  sam we could probably divvy up the equipment at pumats he won’t ask any questions  travis let’s do it  laura how do you know how do you know hes not working for the empire  travis he’s pretty nice  laura the /none/ only store in the empire  travis he seems like a nice guy  laura hes probably working for the empire  liam i would agree with fjords sentiment if we took it out of my own bag theres four of pumats  so one of those pumats would see it coming out of my own stuff  travis plus we’re returning customers  liam yeah that’s also true  marisha wait what are you agreeing with that hes nice or that hes working for the empire  liam no that hes nice  marisha okay  laura i don’t /none/ want to trust him  liam we could also go to a breakfast shop and do it there  marisha the two arent mutually exclusive we know that right he can be nice and working for  the empire  laura i had a dream about pumat sol attacking us  sam you did not  travis attacking us  laura i did i had a dream about it  sam what that seems terrible  laura this is laura actually i did have a dream  matt what are you serious that’s terrifying  taliesin i was starting to /none/ go in that direction of is this a real thing  laura no it really was it was a dream that pumat sol betrayed us and he attacked us all  anyway  taliesin this is clarota aftershock  laura i’m just letting you know we dont know anything about him  sam oh my god  travis i think if you give him a chance hell do you right  sam banjo music  laura anyway i dont want to bring out all of this stuff from the assassin guy in front of him  taliesin lets go shopping /none/ at pumat sol’s and then we’ll divvy up everything when we’re in private  matt you guys making your way to the pentamarket  laura yes  liam pumat voice respectfully we are  matt okay it’s still early morning relatively you make your way to the warm welcoming interior  of the invulnerable vagrant there are no other patrons in there you do see across the way one  pumat sol is sitting behind the counter with knitting needles there is one off to the side in  a chair that’s currently reading through a book the small set /none/ of glasses on the tip of his wide  nose they both look up and go why hello there thats just a real nice thing to see you this  early in the morning just about to finish my breakfast snack so you caught me at a good time  marisha the fuck  laura are you open all the time  sam this is normal it’s okay  matt not all the time we generally do a cycle of sunrise to about four hours past sunset thats  our general scheme that we maintain business  travis pumat wed /dung/ like to introduce you to one of our friends this is beau  marisha sup  matt beau well the pleasure is respectfully mine he reaches out giant hand encompasses your  entire fist  marisha little clammy  matt he puts the book down takes his glasses off what can i do for you  laura well my moms birthday is coming up and she really likes boxes that have do you have a  leadlined box  matt weve got quite a few here currently containing items that require shielding  laura oh good  matt yeah  /none/ laura can we get one of those  matt that can probably be done how big a box youre looking we got them right around that  there then we got a bigger one about that there then we got one in the back that’s a biggie  laura probably the grande the middle  marisha i was thinking the same thing  matt all right let me go ahead and  sam wait mr pumat what is it made of what does it do  matt well what the nice lady there is requesting is a box that is /none/ lined with the  material known as lead  sam ive heard of the material but does it have any other magical properties  matt no magical properties it’s just really useful for poisoning yourself if you put food  storage in there poisoning other people if you store their food in it and keeping at bay the  prying eyes of distant divination magics  sam okay  taliesin i think we’re probably going to need a couple of healing potions as well  sam yeah to replenish  matt not a problem  taliesin i’m going to window /none/ shop then thank you  travis pumat we came into a little extra coin recently and this is our favorite place to spend  you don’t happen to have any articles of protection do you a necklace a bracelet a ring  matt well we got this here cloak here on the wall i think you’ve already taken a look at it  that’s a pretty protective  travis it was expensive right  taliesin it was expensive  matt the other one whos knitting is like yeah it’s a pretty penny because that’s a pretty item  goes back /none/ to knitting  liam sorry how much precisely was that one again  matt that one will run you about 800 gold pieces  laura still out of the reach there  liam and marisha singing how much is that doggy in the window  matt we got this nice shield over here that we just had finished a couple days ago thats an  enchanted little delightful piece that one is a little more affordable at about 550 gold pieces  laura what does it look like though  matt the shield itself has the head of two lions /none/ facing away from each other with their claws  extended it has almost a diamond shape its a pretty decent size the coloration of it is a  bright gold where the lions are the back of it is a dull almost graphite metallic with a gold  border around the edge of it it’s very pretty  laura what does it do  matt this one it improves your defenses more than a normal shield would it instinctively  places the shield in places that might help protect from incoming blows therefore making you  hard to connect with /none/  laura oh thats pretty cool  matt whispers its a plus one  laughter  laura how much is your fancy box  matt the fancy box that you’re requesting while not actually enchanted it is taking away one of  the objects that we keep contained so respectfully ill have to charge you the cost of  that one and a replacement but thatll simply put you back about 15 gold pieces total  laura its probably smart though huh its probably made a bit better  marisha ill go in on it what was in the box /none/ though originally  matt that is none of your concern  marisha how much to make it my concern  matt your friend is a strange one  laura she really is shes always asking questions that are weird  liam she is very useful in the right circumstances  matt oh i can entirely understand that  marisha im right here i can hear you all talking about me  laura she can catch arrows out of midair  matt thats really impressive  sam mr pumat i have another request i know that i had requested would it /none/ be possible to  invent a small haversack just the pocket thing but do you have any sort of magic incantation  ability if i gave you a flask could you make it never run out of alcohol  matt actually that is a very doable enchantment itll take us a little while but we  can definitely make something like that happen  sam how much would that rd cost me  matt about a weeks worth of enchanting time the cost will put you at about 250 gold pieces  sam ill take it  laughter  sam /none/ heres my platinum flask could you also put a nice little flourishy design on the side of the flask  matt we can go ahead and outsource that yeah we can make that happen for you couldnt we the  one knitting goes yeah thats not a problem at all  sam oh wow  laura that’s a lot of gold  sam thats nothing its nothing at all  matt you’re going to pay up for now up front  sam sure here take it  matt oh the whole lump sum up front  sam yep all up /none/ front  matt i appreciate your trust in our ability writes up a quick little piece of paper hands it  to you as a receipt  laura we should buy that box  liam we definitely should i will buy that box for us how much was it  laura it was 15 gold  matt 15 gold pieces for the box you wanted two healing potions that’ll put you back about 100  gold pieces for the two  travis that sounds fine  marisha any other healing potions you got  matt we got probably another dozen /none/ or so more if you want to buy  marisha i’ll take one more as well  travis here’s ten platinum  matt ten whole platinum all right there 50 gold from each of you that’s a healing potion to  each of you  liam also i assume it is out of my reach pricewise and im on a budget but do you deal  in arcane knowledge preprepared scrolls of any kind  matt yeah we have certainly many number of various scrolls and scroll types and spells if  thats what youre looking for we can definitely /none/ provide  liam what is the range what are your lowest rung i guess im curious to know  matt im going to go ahead and doublecheck here he goes through his ledger lets see the  very basic ones whether that be cantrips or 1stlevel spellcasting those are fairly common  those will put you back about 50 to 100 gold approximately  liam dm a question from liam can cantrips be added if theyre found  matt i imagine they could  liam okay  taliesin greater healing potion yeah  matt no its a regular healing potion /none/ regular heal if youre going up from there to 2nd or  3rdlevel thosell put you back probably closer to maybe 250500 gold depending and then it  skyrockets from there  liam you know i am interested in everything from the second level and below do you have a menu  matt i mean we have to order them from the academy but we can get them in here for you or  the halls of erudition  liam give me a moment players handbook  marisha taliesin are you seeing wait no are you seeing the potion of /none/ healing  sam go to your dd beyond app it has all the manuals  taliesin potion of healing  marisha im only seeing the greaters  taliesin careful if you’re filtering by type i was having a problem with that its potion of  healing  laura we should probably get back and put the thing in this box though  matt the box is presented you pay for that 15 gold  taliesin its black its not green blue or purple its black text it took me a second to  realize  sam maybe you should cancel /none/ the order have him make something else  laura what should we have him make  sam a flask  matt a lead flask its weird every level the intelligence gets lower  travis well should we go  liam hold your horses  travis oh were looking up something  matt while this is happening pumat picks up the book again and puts the glasses on and starts  continuing to read  taliesin i was doing a look around to see if there was anything new  sam did we get any healing potions  matt make an /none/ investigation check  marisha i got one  sam do you need any more caleb  liam no i am very good thank you  laura ill buy a healing potion  taliesin 12  matt right so another 50 off you 12 nothing at the moment its only been a few days and the  enchantment process andor the coming in of new objects can take a while to stock back up the  shield is the most recent creation that was presented thats the only new one you see other  than that theres still the pearl theres /none/ still the cloak a few other odds and small wands  taliesin the cloak was the most exciting thing  travis forgive me i couldnt help but wonder have you ever had a chance pumat prime rather  have you had a chance to exercise your arcane abilities  matt oh if you want pumat prime hes in the back i can go get him for you  travis yeah if you wouldnt mind  matt all right he puts the book down on the counter glasses off turns around leaves comes  back in takes the glasses puts them /none/ on takes the book and continues reading while pumat prime  comes from the back once again the large set of goggle glasses on the apron on i was told that  i was requested to greet you with a hello  marisha what is happening  travis these are all whats the correct term  laura sicrulalium  matt simulacrum thats the one yeah i know its a little confusing  travis theyre all copies of this fine gentleman pumat i wanted to ask were such fans of your  store did you ever find call to i dont /none/ know use your magic for combat what led you to a store  like this  matt thats kind of a personal story lets just say i didnt get along with my peers at a young  age and found myself wandering got picked up by some nice mages that saw some potential took me  in and helped me hone my craft and helped me set up a store and here i am in zadash  travis thats great how many years have you had this store  matt been running this place for a good 12 years  /none/ travis congratulations its really a thing  matt thank you  laura what mages were you with what mages found you were they with the academy  matt sort of they were with the cerberus assembly  laura thats right you were talking about them before  matt yeah they really oh no  sam it gets caught in the corners  travis shake it out of the corners of the giant flask  liam oh no  marisha what is hiding in those corners though  sam good stuff  matt the main person whos been of aid to /none/ me is the headmaster oremid hass who runs the hall of  erudition  sam we still havent gone there have we weve heard about it like seven times  marisha he runs the hall of erudition  matt hes the headmaster of the hall he scratches his chin for a second hes the  archmage of cultivation within the cerberus assembly hes been a real nice beacon of  tutelage hes a bit rough on the edges and seems tough but hes a softie especially when it comes  to small critters dont tell him i said that for /none/ that one moment you see a look of fear in his eyes  travis and liam small critters  sam wait he likes small critters like me  matt maybe i dont know anyway i got to get back to work he quickly goes into the back room again  travis thanks for your time pumat  matt dont mention it the one thats reading off to the sides goes  sam hes cool right  marisha that guys crazy  travis hes actually still here  marisha gah  liam lets get back to business i dont know what /none/ you have on tap here but im looking for  something just a cantrip pretty common shocking  matt shocking grasp i know what youre talking about  liam you know how it works  matt i got it myself anyone want to see  travis i would like it  laura okay  marisha yeah  matt all righty i like the gumption he goes and gives a big old handshake to beauregard let  me look that up real fast  marisha i dont know what im agreeing to  matt its an autohit because youre reaching out /none/ to it you immediately grab his giant mitt  and a flash of white light and pain as electricity rocks through your body you take three points of  lightning damage  marisha yelps fuck  liam that is the one  marisha get that  matt that one will run you 75 gold pieces  liam excellent pause the other thing  matt hands they look pawsish but yeah  liam the other one that i am interested in that is not really my forte but many wizards believe  it is of great benefit do you have the /none/ shield spell  matt we can get you a shield spell thats a pretty standard defensive mechanism for those of  the arcane persuasion  liam how much will that run me  matt he thumbs through the ledger that one will cost you about 200 gold pieces  liam i will take the pair  matt all righty there  sam what was the first one  laura shocking grasp  sam well be twinsies  matt 275 gold pieces he sets his book back down puts his glasses down leaves the room for a  second and is /none/ gone for about a minute or so comes back with two scrolls and sets them on the  table  liam i will take those thank you very much herr sol  matt my pleasure  laura did you just call him asshole  liam that is arschloch so no  sam wait a minute what does that mean  liam which  sam nothing  liam whos on first  laura should we go  travis lets get that thing in its box  matt anything else you guys require or can you leave me to my reading  /none/ sam whatcha reading  matt its a collection of crazy tales about this weird fella  laura what guy  matt its the daring trials and tribulations of sir taryon darrington this guys been all over  the place its kind of wild  laughter  taliesin wow ten episodes  liam fiction or  matt oh its got to be fiction laughter but its good fiction  travis are you fucking kidding me  liam well sum it up for me give me the tensers floating disk pitch  laura no  travis oh my god  matt well /none/ let me finish my book before i tell you too much about it needless to say hes got  this wild constructlooking friend called dottie and apparently according to this thing theres  these powerful folks from over there in taldorei that hes been meeting up with that keep messing  up every time they go on an adventure real thorns in his side  liam we can relate im a big reader if you finish that i dont know if you are the kind of  fellow who likes to keep every book he reads but  matt i /none/ got a collection  liam oh ja that makes sense okay well i will look for it elsewhere thank you  matt sure i got this shipped out to me from deastok perhaps if you are in that vicinity see  that you get yourself a copy  liam oh okay  travis bestseller or used book  matt i had never heard of it until this so probably not that easy to find  liam would you be able to put in an order for this book for me  matt i mean im not really a book retailer /none/  liam i understand but you know many people you are obviously a very knowledgeable fellow who has  vast connections  marisha i bet we could go back to the chastitys nook for that  sam they will probably have it  matt that is probably a place to look for a book  laura it sounds like smut to me  liam its a dirty book  matt not yet  liam all right well i wait for your full review thank you  laura you just wait  matt all right  marisha its called the daring /none/ tales  sam sounds like shite caleb there are much better books out there  laura lets go come on there are things that need to be taken care of caleb  liam true i got distracted you know  travis pumat thanks for your time we will not be bothering you any longer  laura but we will be back because we like you so much  matt you are always welcome any time all of us are happy to see you come in and spend your  hardearned money  laura thank you  sam goodbye  matt /none/ goodbye goodbye goodbye a little hand comes out from the curtain in the back  byebye  laura lets go come on weve got to get back to the tap  travis we double dash back to the tap  sam to the tap why are we going there now oh to the box thing  laura yeah and to look at the stuff caleb identified for us  matt all right so you guys return do you head down to the basement  laura yeah  marisha i make sure its still there  matt its still there  /none/ laura lets put it in the thing  liam so i put the box right down next to me and i put my coat  sam is the skeleton alive  matt no the skeleton is still dead  marisha he didnt bring anything back to life thats good  liam okay so this is better than it was before you have monster calves do you want to carry this now  laura what like on me all the time  liam i am  matt as hes holding it placing it over the box theres still that undulating low /none/ hum and  grayish glow  laura i mean i can carry this box with me all the time but dont you think its weird to carry  around a box all the time  travis no  liam no people carry boxes  sam can we put the box in the  taliesin the bag  sam oh wait we cant put the box in the bag  travis why  sam crossing the streams  marisha but now we can put the dodecahshitball in the box and now the box in the bag right  matt make an /none/ arcana check  sam still crossing the streams  marisha still crossing the streams  liam the lead is just to protect this item from divination  travis 22 plus four  liam i am worried about crossing two planes of existence it might not be that at all but it is  definitely not worth chancing  matt the essence as youre looking at this and concentrating on this object trying to get a  grasp on it now that you have a good moment to look at it the school of magic or whatever the  source of /none/ the magic is here escapes you it seems almost beyond or separate than some of the magics  that youve naturally learned through your acquisition of spells and the pact that you had  made but you dont get the sense that its extraplanar or anything that would constitute the  same level of danger that you think caleb is focused on  liam tell me  travis yeah i say that  liam what you have experience with things of this nature  travis it seems like a different sort of arcana than the type that ive seen  /none/ liam okay well thats fine im going to walk about 200 feet away from you when you put it in  that bag  laura i put it in the bag  laughter  matt okay i need you all to roll no i’m kidding  laughter  matt well thats a tpk you plop it in the bag and it vanishes inside the pouch  laura how long does it take to take effect if were all going to die  liam it takes about two weeks so i guess we’ll find out  laura eventually i put my /none/ bag back on  travis what else we got  liam oh yes very good things  sam yes the items  liam the daggers are just daggers okay  sam ill take those  liam who cares about daggers honestly but this i hold up this longsword which i can barely  hold up this would be good for either of you two i will let you decide fjord here this is a very  strong sword it is very good against creatures that is for you to look at then these boots would  make anyone better but /none/ i think that beauregard might benefit from them the most i could be  wrong im going to give them to beau and let you decide  marisha all right all right  laura what is it what are they what do they do  matt the downside is longswords are not finesse weapons so youd have to use strength  to utilize it  travis thats pretty dope  marisha yeah  travis pretty dope  taliesin this is really bloody heavy  laura is it  taliesin you could actually  laura could i use that a longsword /none/  matt yeah well are you proficient with weapons like a longsword your weapon proficiencies my  players handbook keeps disappearing from me  sam why do we only have one  liam theres another one its just gone missing  taliesin i know someone who might really enjoy this if you dont want it  marisha we have like 30 handbooks around here somewhere  taliesin we took them all outside and they stayed there  laura did i put that down i might have written my proficiencies  sam how many weapons can you wield  laura simple /none/ weapons  matt yeah so you could not use a longsword  taliesin i think i know somebody who could really enjoy this and ill hold on to it for a friend  laura could yasha use that  taliesin i think yasha might get a kick out of it  laura oh that’s great  marisha wait is she still a thing shes going to come back  sam gone forever  taliesin ive known yasha a long time she makes her way back around  travis although that greatsword she has is mighty fine  liam i mean /dung/ we will probably never see her again that seems a little foolish to me  laura i hope shes still in the city because otherwise shes going to have a really hard time  trying to get back in  taliesin well eventually need a bath and well find her again  liam could one of us carry it until she returns who could really use it  laura i dont think anyone can use it  liam not you you are so good with a sword  travis yeah certainly i just have a preference with mine im just /none/ real comfortable with it you know  when you get a feel for something you dont want to change it up too much  taliesin it’s worth holding onto  liam of course yes  marisha i respect her ability to handle her own shit on her own time  laura what do the boots do  marisha they’re pretty great so i strap on the big gothy boots  travis bigass tall doc martens  marisha super tall doc martens lots of little furlined lots of straps and zippers  matt these boots are designed in a similar style /dung/ as to the armor of the xhorhasian individual you  had fought  laura is it kind of obvious  matt no not obvious they’re made of a very dark brown or black leather with studs and the tops of  them curl up into two spikes at the tip at each side  marisha how do they look  laura well normally youre barefoot so it looks pretty good it makes your pants billow a little  weird but i like it  marisha yeah it’s hard to tuck your pants into your boots  liam i thought you /none/ would like those was i right i was right wasnt i  marisha theyre pretty great they add 1d8 to my initiative roll  liam once per day so you can choose a moment  to get the jump  marisha does anyone else feel like they might benefit from these more than me  liam i mean anybody would but  taliesin i think i’m pretty good with this  travis my initiative bonus is zero just saying exaggerated cough no you keep them  marisha your initiative bonus is zero  liam yeah but you know beauregard really /none/ is the most capable fighter in this group at this moment  in time what that’s just the truth can you handle the truth  laura can you handle the truth  marisha i feel like nott might be able to do some good with these too if she had them  sam i defer to the wisdom of the group we merely follow your expert wisdom  marisha okay i’m sensing some passive aggressive  sam no i am sincere  travis whispering just smile and say thank you nott  marisha thank you nott  travis whispering very /none/ good  marisha very good thank you thank you nott  sam what is that crazy expression  laughter  sam i saw your gums for a second it was freaky  marisha dont patronize me nott  laura ooh i take out the wand of smiles and i cast it at her  matt well you have to make a saving throw  marisha oh do i  sam i forgot we had that  marisha what kind of a saving throw  matt is it a wisdom saving throw  laura charisma  marisha oh thats not good /none/ for me nope definitely not  matt yep for the next minute your face is curled up into a jokerlike smile  liam oh i love making people happy  laura now you look so happy its so wonderful  marisha voice cracking i am so happy  travis so we should ugh just look at them  taliesin ugh  travis we should probably do something we still have to wrap up this deception of ours  laura oh right what are we supposed to do now  marisha brightly go talk to the gentleman of course  laura /tavern/ but wait  travis you sound like the general car insurance  marisha singing 1800general  laura what does the general have to do with  sam the gentleman  laura what does the gentleman have to do with this plan though  sam we were going to investigate kara who was going to the bar that the gentleman frequents  laura oh thats what it was okay so we go to the evening nip to investigate her and then we  just happen to talk to the gentleman too  sam if it happens if it comes up  /none/ liam but also we did not get the full catchup fjord what about the remnants of i know  everything is verkakte the highrichter is dead thats half the job done in a way we did not  predict but what about lord sutan did you talk to dolan and are they going to get the  crownsguard in there  sam oh yeah we have to send the guards to find the evidence oh god  liam we cant do anything dolan was going to handle that part of this  marisha i feel like its all gone to /none/ shit  travis yeah i think thats right actually i forgot that part  laura i wonder if its all a distraction though for the big stuff  marisha i think thats exactly what this is  taliesin im wondering if the guards are already there looking at the mysterious explosion that  happened in that house  laura well that was the highrichters house but lord sutan probably went home and noticed his  rug was missing  liam absolutely noticed that the very expensive magical rug is gone  laura and so did he go to the guards /none/ or did he go oh shit i was hiding something  travis did we plant something in lord sutans house are they going to find the letter from  sam and we stole a seal  liam listen this could all appear like the knights turned on the highrichter i thought we  wanted to get rid of lord sutan  travis we did  laura yes but we put evidence in his house so if he noticed that the rug was missing  liam yeah  laura he goes to the crownsguard to report a robbery then they go /none/ in and they find the  evidence that he was actually trying to be behind the attack that happened so it actually is good  that we destroyed the rug because it led the guards into his house  sam hmm  travis i dont know if he would report a robbery if he had a rug of attacking and you triggered it  liam and actual connections to the myriad  laura but he are you okay beau  marisha smiling is so painful  laura it can be  marisha groans  laura should we go spy on /none/ his house and see if there are crownsguard in it  sam oh boy  travis we could certainly go by  laura do you think they would let anyone back into the trispire  travis oh shit i forgot  liam it’ll flip the situation dolan i believe was saying that with the highrichter in place  she was favoring sutan and now she is gone dolan will hopefully take that seat if he takes that  seat dolan is not going to protect lord sutan in the way that he claimed that the highrichter was  travis thats /none/ right  liam i dont know maybe we walk away from the whole thing discuss it as a possibility  travis we got paid already how much did i get paid because it was minus karas  matt minus karas that would have been 628 gold 21 silver and 302 copper  sam oh did we get paid  travis i did  laura for what  sam fuck that  marisha yeah  matt so whats the plan  liam well heres the thing if dolan assumes that seat we have no idea if thats going to happen  /none/ but if dolan does take that richters seat sutan if nothing happens to him if no guards go into  sutans house he knows that his rug is gone he realizes someone has been in his home 100 he  looks through the home himself finds our fake message from the myriad or whoever would he  retaliate on dolan do we care  marisha yeah youre actually yeah i dont think youre so far off theres something weird  thats been striking me with dolan this whole time he doesnt seem like he really has the  tenacity of /none/ someone who actually wanted that seat maybe he was a pawn this whole time that guy is  kind of a coward  travis mmhmm  marisha and i mean this with all due respect  the guy was kind of a coward  laura i am sad that i did that to her because  marisha thats how you do it right no  travis i dont know if theyll send anything back on dolan but we should find a way to get  crownsguard into lord sutans place  liam well it was dolan who said i believe /none/ he had the relationship with orentha so he was going  to report this stuff to orentha and have crownsguard go in now due to the circumstances  of the evening we have missed the element of a quick surprise they did not rush in the way we  had hoped so hes already realized somebody has jacked his shit im not worried really about  him finding us but he had a bad night when he came home  travis we cant have dolan rat on him hmm  liam but if we dont give a shit about dolan /tavern/ then theres no problem really but maybe we do  marisha i am really interested in this kara girl im wondering if shes a puppet master throughout  this whole game  travis lets try that  sam so well go to the evening nip  travis yeah lets try that  matt okay so you guys are going to the evening nip all right you make your way over to the  familiar dirty small sunken dive bar the same two beefylooking guards on the outside eyeing you  as you enter you come inside the same two individuals /none/ sitting at the the same booth and the  far table and there lies clive binz the dwarf with the halfburned beard as you enter hes  like ah good to see you again what can i get you  laura shit  marisha this is clive the bartender hold pause its something along the lines of okay  sam are we gonna do this are we doing the gentleman  marisha this is clive the bartender right  matt yeah clive  marisha yeah we are so beau and jester walk up and say  laura hi  marisha /none/ sup  matt can i get you anything  marisha i mean i know id like a drink  laura yes i would like some milk  marisha but unfortunately we have no coin however we are willing to offer many gifts  matt right well then take these gifts with you he turns around and looks at the rest of  you and steps into the back room  laura do we follow him  sam im so scared right now  matt do you follow him  travis yeah we fucking follow him into the room  matt /none/ all right you step into the back room of this dive and as you step inside its a storage  cupboard theres shelves up there with various bottles of liquor wine and ale hes currently  pulling a small chain up on the corner as he does you watch as a small trap door goes  creaking it winches up and theres a stairway that leads down and he goes  travis yep  marisha and laura thank you  sam mazel tov  matt as you all slowly descend down the stairs it closes behind you you hear a /none/ few things  shift over it you descend down the stairway and you begin to pick up the sound of soft music  theres a gentle violin playing and a lute or some sort of small string instrument this  staircase spirals downward onto the left and as it curves down for about 40 or so feet its  getting colder just from the subterranean depth that youre going from the warmer surface  eventually you hear some voices and some laughter and a clink of glasses as you curve  down the light gets brighter from around the corner /tavern/ until suddenly you look into a stoneset  subterranean tavern from floor to ceiling its about 20 feet tall you can see there are two  balconies that overlook it from the left side and one thats barely visible around the corner as  the room opens up to the right of you theres a table immediately down from where the spiral  staircase ends and theres a grufflooking fellow sitting there looking up as you enter he looks  immediately defensive the rest of the people in there are drinking and not immediately paying  attention as you begin /dung/ to descend the stairway who all’s going in  laura all of us  matt all right you all begin to descend to the bottom of the stairs theres maybe about a dozen  or so people in here between the bartender folks and you can see two people are playing  music on the upper balcony theres laughter and discussion and theres a card game at the center  table you see a maroon and dull grey robed person arrive but their body is covered with a dark  black almost pantherlike fur their face is catlike with ears /none/ that curl up this is a black  tabaxi that has turned around the corner and goes halt friends i do not recognize lucien  sam who what  matt incredulous youre alive  taliesin oh sorry friend ive got one of those faces people tend to recognize  matt gasping in disbelief lucien she goes forward and does a huge hug  taliesin oh ill go with it  matt and thats where were going to end tonights episode  screaming  travis
