town	 laughter  matt welcome back the dm will remember that  liam are we doing a show right now  matt we are  liam whimpering okay  matt welcome back last we left off the group of adventures in seeking a warband of gnolls which  had attacked the city of alfield they were passing through on their way to zadash began to track  them as to where they had retrieved a number of bodies both dead and living of the civilians of  the town and taken them with them you eventually track them to an abandoned 
dung	 mine a number of miles  away from the city to the northeast you entered narrowly missed a trap or two managed to recover  a couple of interesting items delved off to the left side during the first divide of pathways and  came upon some sort of small ritual with a number of gnolls and some humanoid figure wearing bits of  gnoll as an armor or cloak doing a ritual after he had left along with the previously armored  gnoll that you had battled during the incursion at alfield you tore into a number of hyenas 
none	 and  gnolls that remained within the chamber and upon defeating them took a moment to take a breath  get your bearings before hearing a muffled boom in the distance some sort a low vocalization some  cackling and eventually the scream of a woman saying no my baby you began to run and give  chase that is where were picking up this week grabbing your weapons and keeping your mettle  about you you charge further down the tunnel the shaft curves to the right in a wide spiral about a  few dozen there we go 
none	 what was that  travis the shaft curves to the right  sam you said the sha and she laughed like before you were done with the word shaft  laura because the shaft curves to the right yall  liam its her psychic power  travis its usually to the left but whatever  matt its okay  sam not from her perspective  laughter  matt boom  marisha thats fair  travis too fast like a fencer that was amazing  laura only you  laughter  marisha walked into that one  liam well  marisha 
none	 yeah  travis life or death here we go  matt the tunnel continues in a wide spiral before eventually snaking a bit  laughter  marisha youre an asshole  matt before sharply turning to the right the tunnel straightens out before emerging into a  chamber of goddamn it guys this is serious lives are at stake here okay  laughter  marisha what were you going to say  travis you got it were with you life or death  sam the path  matt the tunnel straightens out before emerging into a chamber of mixed natural 
dung	 rock walls and  simple stone work two other tunnels mark this chamber as a y intersection or like a second  common room similar to the one you that you originally encountered when you entered the mine  tables and stools are strewn about the area with a pair of hyenas currently picking at junk for  scraps you see bits of meat that are being dragged across the ground by them about 20 feet  off to the left two thick natural pillars of rock currently stand as load bearing portions of the  chamber breaking the open 
none	 space while a crumpled section of the floor drops into a pit below two  closed doors to the left of where youre looking into it are guarded by a skeletal gnoll and two  standard gnoll warriors one of which has apparently pulled a small child from one of the  doors the sound of muffled cries coming from beyond the closed door four other gnolls rush  from within the chamber into the right tunnel exiting on the opposite side what do you guys  do  marisha four to the right  matt you watch as four 
none	 of them rush into the other exit theres an exit to the left and an  exit to the right they exit the room to the right and then theres three left two regular  matt travis and marisha singing regular gnolls  matt and then one skeletal gnoll and then two hyenas that are currently picking at scraps you  can see as the gnoll pulls the child out is currently in the process of crying and theyre  both looking at each other like still holding the child by the arm essentially but currently  is bickering with 
none	 the other gnoll  liam from our vantage point it is the entrance that were at and then there is doors to the  left  matt let me go ahead and give you a visual  travis singing visual aid visual aid  liam travis and marisha singing visual aid visual aid  laura oh no if this is like a running thing this whole campaign  taliesin oh theres no getting away from this  laughter  oohs and ahs  laura look at that opening its so cool looking  sam where are we  matt you 
none	 guys are entering from this side  laura oh thats a little door thats the door you were talking about  matt yep  sam theres too many options  matt essentially over here you can place yourselves as you feel necessary off to this  side in whichever marching order you prefer  liam i will be at the rear  matt i figured as much  laura how old is the child that got pulled out of the room  matt at first glance its hard to see especially for those of you who are keeping their  
dung	 light low because there is no light source in the chamber those with dark vision will be making out  most of the details here  travis ill be up front i can do that  matt all right that would put fjord up at the front  laura ill be behind fjord  matt okay  marisha i cant see shit  matt given this you guys are deciding what to do theres in a brief moment of quiet a loud  boom that shakes the interior of the chamber you watch as both the hyenas squeal look up 
none	 scared  the two gnolls immediately look about dust and rocks begin to settle and fall from the ceiling as  it shakes and then comes to rest a moment later a cloud of dust and smoke comes billowing out this  side of the chamber where the four gnolls had run previously then the rumbling settles the gnolls  themselves are spooked then distracted from the child at the moment both peeking over the undead  gnoll stands there glancing about seeming unaffected by the current scenario passive  perception the highest on this would be beauregard caleb molly 
none	 and jester i believe  actually caleb and beauregard would not because they dont see anything you guys hear sounds and  youre waiting for any inclination of light to kick in  laura what do we see though  matt you guys see the faint appearance of some sort of a flying creature very small emerge from  the tunnel that had recently expelled all this dust and smoke  laura frumpkin size or smaller  matt frumpkin size humming it hovers in the air in a few places and then locks itself over  here onto this far 
none	 wall on a higher perch  travis fucking bugs  laura did you see that  taliesin i think i saw that did you see that  laura i saw that  matt snarl another moment passes and the gnolls relax you watch as the immediate dread of  the recent explosion sound the shocking and rocking of the room seems to have passed over  them they both go back to paying attention to their recent vicinity which includes the small  child which is still quietly sobbing in the painful grasp of this large curled gnoll hand  
none	 taliesin on the count of three  sam wait are we just going to attack  travis yeah  sam we should distract them  laura radiant blast  sam oh jesus  laura sacred flame i mean  matt all right the ones who are making the initial strike on this  sam i could distract them or something first  travis eldritch blast for me yeah  liam i will also do that as well following suit with everybody  marisha wait are things happening  laura dont hit the kid  marisha we cant see do you

none	 is currently whats considered an ambush round  you still have advantage on your first strike if theyre not aware of your presence which means it  would cancel out that disadvantage  sam i can take my shot from here  matt you can yes  sam all right i will fire  matt all right  sam ooh 17 plus a lot six 17 plus six to hit  matt that hits you do not get sneak attack on this because you do not have advantage on the  strike  sam i thought you just said i

none	 youre not quite sure of  the age  sam and human i dont know anything about is it injured  matt you havent got a strong bead on it but he looks to be humanoid  marisha six or eight years old  matt around that age group youd assume  taliesin some would say seven  laura yes the field is ours now  sam no im too scared to go over there no theres a child in need weve got to help  travis youre sober now right  sam yeah notts going to scurry over to

none	 quite sure where youre walking  marisha okay sure i will stumble forward i will head towards molly because im going to  follow his fluorescent purple coat  travis just doing this  marisha molly molly  matt hes easy to see because molly has this faint luminous glow around the sword from his  right you see that as a beacon youre like that i know that i can follow you cozy up  right next to molly and carefully prepare yourself  marisha where are they  matt what action are you holding if any  marisha

none	 im lame  matt sorry as you try and release the energy once more it cant quite get a bead on the  gnolls head its moving around and dodging and you cant focus on it  laura im going to start unsnapping my sickle to get it out to hit things  matt okay as youre fussing with this side thats the end of your turn all right caleb  youre up  liam i cannot see anything so i cast dancing lights i put one above my head and as soon as i  get a little bit 
none	 of light i send one over beaus head and then i send one about 20 feet beyond beau  and then the fourth one even beyond that one so theres a line of four lights because i dont know  what the chamber is shaped like  matt the chamber erupts into bright light like theres four torches now lifting brightly at the  entire space  travis ah god  matt bright visuals there you can now see the child on the ground being scared shitless by the  goblin trying to help the undead gnoll thats currently locked 
none	 in combat with molly you see the  two hyenas that are both snarling and getting ready to pounce on whoever comes too close the  one wounded gnoll over there as well as if youd like to describe yourself  exclamations of excitement  sam where is he  liam you know matthew the guiding lights those little foomphs of light they only have a  10foot radius so probably the edges of the line that i have cast just barely makes it flame  marisha theyre like market lights so its pretty yeah  liam of course it 
none	 is of course pretty never mind just continue  matt yes so  khary the thing you probably notice about me first of all  travis and marisha highpitched ooh  sam no you cant have a better accent than all of us  khary is my hair my billowy white afro  travis yes  khary fingers of curly hair radiating in all directions that should be the thing that you  notice first about me but thats not it its my eyes my eyes as white as my hair my pupilless  eyes as white as my hair 
none	 as white as the hair dripping down from my chin to a straight point  about three or four inches below i think thats all you really notice  travis shit  matt caleb do you wish to move  marisha im in love what  matt caleb do you wish to move  marisha oh  liam oh fuck that i will stay where i am no thank you  matt all right fjord and the gnoll going at the same time what are you doing  travis eldritch blast again at that motherfuck  matt as this gnoll 
none	 here has taken the impact is going to rush over towards mollymauk to attempt to  take a strike while another gnoll whos bloodied and partially crushed is now hobbling its way up  out of this tunnel and spins around to see you up against the side of the wall growls and yips  all right fjord  travis 16 plus six so 22  matt that hits the gnolls going to be striking you thats a three thats not going to happen  no  travis eight plus four is 12 plus four points of necrotic for 16 
none	 total points of damage  matt all right the reason it misses is right as it swings towards you fjord raises the back of  the sword and fires a blast of eldritch energy that hits the back of the gnolls shoulder as it  tries to spin and strike you as it does it goes wide it pirouettes on its foot and stumbles back  into the open hole highpitched yell  travis oh theres an open fucking hole thats good to know oh shit  matt yeah  liam did you hear the sound go highpitched yell so 
none	 its not ten feet its big  travis okay good to know fuck  matt youre a ways away its hard to see  travis yeah uhhuh  matt described your initial description of the room though so now you know as you who has not  given your name yet but you turn around and see this gnoll as it looks towards you its leaning  towards normally it would be sevenfoot but its hunched and wounded and as it turns down it  snarls takes its spear and attempts to pin you to the wall a bit thats 
none	 going to be a 12 whats  your armor class  khary my armor class is what is it its 15  matt 15 it does not hit  travis yeah  matt as it swings you push out of the way in time parrying it with your hand and your cane off  to the side and it smacks into the stone and sparks off of it for a second hitting flint all  right that ends the gnolls turn the hyenas go both of these hyenas now turning around and  seeing whats happening are going to rush 
none	 forward this one is going to run up alongside and attack  molly this one is going to rush over to nott  laura oh no  matt attacking molly thats going to be a 16 to hit  taliesin that hits  matt all right its going to be  travis dance harder dance harder  matt two points of piercing damage as it snaps up and bites the edge of your foot you have to  kick and shake it off on the rocks to get it to let go the one thats striking towards you nott  
none	 thats going to be an 18 to hit  sam hits  matt you take only one point of piercing damage it gets one little bite on the side of your elbow  and you immediately pull away and kick it instinctually in the chin going yelps the kid  is now freaking out of his mind as now theres from his perspective two snarling beasts  cornering in thats going to end the hyenas turn all right your go  khary i would say if this thing is this close to me  matt yeah its right up against 
none	 you  khary its right up against me i think i should push him away  matt if you feel the need yeah  khary lets see thunderwave  matt certainly  sam skadoosh  matt is that a wisdom saving throw or constitution  liam its a constitution save  khary that is a constitution save  matt that is a three a natural two plus actually plus zero so two  travis oh yeah that fails  matt yeah that fails  sam your spellcasting modifier  travis he rolled a two youre fine  liam 15

none	 four points of piercing damage that could have been a lot worse  travis thats pretty bad for him though  liam no actually that hurts an awful lot  matt the gnoll released the arrow as it hits you in the stomach it comes piercing out the other  side pinning your jacket to you torso you feel like the pain and the warm pulse up your back from  the wound its almost numb at first and then you feel the shock hit you as the gnoll turns and runs  this way  laura oh no i 
dung	 should have tolled the dead on him  matt and hes way over there  thats going to ends the gnolls turn while youre going fjord because youre going in the  same round as this is happening so you technically could intercept  travis id like to get line of sight on him i look back at caleb with his failed attempts and  say let me try mine ill move my hex over to him  matt the hex is on him  travis ill fire an eldritch blast in his direction that is only a 16  
none	 matt a 16 16 hits actually you needed a 15 to hit  travis four plus four eight plus three points of necrotic for 11 damage  matt as it turns with its bow fjord runs around holding your sword out another burst of eldritch  energy smacks into the back of the gnoll you hear screeches as it falls to the ground and slow  bits of curling green and blue eldritch flame begin to burn and consume the corpse before  eventually it goes out leaving most of the body intact its back shoulder blades now a black 
dung	 cave  where its body once was  liam you ganked him at the last second  laura someone bring me those ears and bring them to my jar  matt that being the case the combat has come to an end  laura how many gnolls was that we just killed  travis three  liam well dont we send a lot of them down the hole we didnt get their ears so bad job  laura we only sent one down the hole  travis we got two ears  matt correct theyre sets of ears theres the

none	 here  liam yes handle this child but then were very curious to ask a couple ill shut up  laura can you heal do you have healing because im stabilizing him dont worry but  sam he doesnt look good  khary i think i can maybe do something about that  matt perhaps the child is wounded but the childs wounds have been tended to hes  unconscious but is no longer in immediate danger of dying hell eventually need rest  laura and some doughnuts  matt perhaps some doughnuts  laura i take one and push 
none	 it onto his face  travis no no fresh doughnuts you know do no harm all that shit  sam can you do anything to help this guy  khary well he seemed to be stabilized i think the best thing we could do is to get him to  safety  travis i agree what were you doing down here we ourselves were comin down trying to rescue folks  khary i tend to look over the people who happen to be around here i come by every once in a  while i used to live and grew 
none	 up in this place or in the valley not too far from here probably  just like you i heard a commotion ive taken a few of these people to safety ive been trying to  do it less overtly than some of you  travis we do make a bit of a clatter  laura were working on it  sam insight check  laughter  11 plus what am i adding 13  matt 13 hes generally pretty forthright in speech charismatic figure you dont get any  sense of any immediate lying or conflict to the words 
none	 hes saying youre also not getting a full  read either  sam how handsome is he  matt quite handsome if youd like to describe how handsome you are  liam yeah what do you look like  khary i would say im an old  laura on a scale from one to ten  khary on a scale from one to ten i would call him striking  sam bachelorette finalist  laughter  khary you know what i think hes old enough that hes gotten past all the bacheloring and the  bacheloretteing  liam are you 
none	 a gray fox is that what you are  khary i would call him more of a shock of white i mean hes a striking character hes got three  dimples one you cant see two are pretty deep in his face and can be menacing unless hes  smiling  laura what are you wearing  khary hes covered in leather straps that are a tangle of brown and red and green that pretty much  cover him from his neck to his calf where his boots start to take over theres a hood that hes  wearing deep 
none	 green it goes down to his legs and a big enough hood thats able to cover his ample  locks  liam meanwhile everyone is talking to this stranger im going to edge up to this hole in the  ground and hold onto rocks because im scared to death look over and send my globules of light  down there to see if its a deep hole if it goes a long way what am i looking at  matt as your lights begin to slowly drift down into the hole they get about 50 or 60 feet down 
none	  before you begin to see the bottom of the shaft it looks to have been an intentionally created  welllike hole that has since seen disuse currently ends into rocks and rubble  laura its a poop hole  matt you see the broken body of a gnoll and the broken body of a hyena down at the bottom of it  liam we have to get this gnoll out of the bottom of this hole because thats gold  laura hes probably covered in really old poop  liam its still good for the monetary value that was 
none	 laid out for us so maybe on the way out we  could send we have a rope we could lower you down and you could slice it off  sam yeah i could down there  liam not right now save it for a rainy day  travis shakäste my name is fjord we are like i said on a rescue mission are you familiar with  these tunnels at all have you been down here before  khary have i been down here before  matt the most youve been down was the opposite side of this tunnel 
none	 here there was a group up  here where you had been working with previously but only recently decided to delve deeper once you  had made sure that those few were safe  khary right right well ive done a pretty good job of taking care of the other tentacle of this  cavern i guess youd say  laura shaft  khary yes the shaft thats a good way of putting it that boom you may have heard happened  to come from me so weve got a little bit less to have to deal with this i 
none	 really dont know  whats going on  laura oh speaking of i stand up and i  walk to the door where the little kid was pulled from  liam wait nott do you want to let her take a look at it in case it could blow up on you  sam ive seen their traps i know their methods  laura are there any ropes across the door  sam let me look are there  matt make an investigation check  sam five plus five is ten  matt best you can tell it doesnt appear 
none	 to be trapped it does have a simple latch that is only  accessible from the outer side but it is not locked  laura i knock on the door housekeeping is anybody locked in here  matt a moment passes theres no response but you hear the faint sniffing and whimpering of  somebody on the other side  laura i think its the mom  sam lets open the door  laura okay turning noise  matt you lift the small latch and pull the door open first it hits you a strong smell of decay  you 
none	 see the back of this room is filled with piles of bodies or parts of bodies it looks to be maybe  four people in total that have been placed here then theres one living woman in her midthirties  or so who is wearing a dirtied apron shes covered in dirt a spatter of blood you dont  know if its from her or not her hair is ratted she looks to be human shes currently huddled  with her knees to her chest and theres tear streaks down her face  sam is the is the oh sorry 
none	 go on  khary can i walk to her  matt yeah as you open the door you watch as shakäste begins to approach and take the space  khary i look her in the eye i put my hand on her chin so that she looks me in the eye and i tell  her shh what does that make her feel  matt you watch as theres a brief moment of confusion and then an expression of  acknowledgement comes across her face she reaches up and takes your hand she goes thank you  thank you  
none	 khary we need to get her out of here  laura yes definitely  marisha holy shit this guys good  travis he is smooth operator  sam can i ask the woman is this your child  matt she turns around and she goes oh my god she runs over to him and immediately picks him up  into her arms and begins to hold him  laura hes alive dont worry  matt crying thank you thank you shes rocking the child in her arms quietly rubbing his  face and wiping a bit of blood off of 
none	 his cheeks  laura are there any other people that are alive that you know of  matt there are a few i havent seen but ive heard voices across the way and they took a  number deeper in before they locked me in  laura oh can we run over to the other door  taliesin i was saying if im not near the other door im going to start looking and unlatching it  nonchalantly  matt you unlatch it you watch as the mother whos currently running her fingers over the hair  of the boy 
none	 says jules its okay its okay jules she pulls him in the other door as you  open it a familiar sight it looks like theres three bodies in here these bodies seem to be  placed in here for some sort of storage for the time being there is one figure you can see a man  in his older years halfelven in appearance his features are a little sharper a little more  elven but not fully his hair is darkbrown black to gray and salt and pepper on the sides  he looks as disheveled as the 
none	 woman you just uncovered  laura but hes alive  matt hes alive  taliesin this is a personal question is there anyone alive in here right now  matt im the only one  taliesin oh well well take it im swinging the door open and coming in  matt you get up and you can see now theres a large claw gash across his midsection that might  be infected  taliesin if you wait a second its only getting better  matt who are you  taliesin oh that is a question were here to help come 
town	 on out  laura were the rescue party  marisha is there anyone else that you were with thats no longer with us in there  matt i mean he points back and says i dont know most of these folks i was just passing  through we were bringing some of our armorwares up to zadash when we were waylaid on the road  marisha you didnt get taken from alfield  matt oh we were taken on the way to alfield we were almost there they hit us right as they were  reaching the city we had 
none	 no chance  taliesin you got hit on the way to the city not in the raid on the city  matt we were just arriving in alfield when it hit  laura bad timing  matt youre telling me  taliesin lets get you out here for a second  matt the woman has come up once again to  khary i have a place for these people to go its up on the surface  laura theyre safe there  khary they will be safe there  laura do you have a cart to get them back to 
none	 alfield  khary well a cart was just the thing i was needing what say we hang out  laura all of us together like a big party  khary ive got nothing else to do  laura i like it  taliesin so many new friends lately  travis i am concerned that there are more further on in these tunnels but i think youre right we  wont be of any use to these people if we dont get them to safety first  khary exactly  marisha how far was that tunnel to the surface we cleared 
dung	 out this side  khary have we lost our way from or at least the way that i  matt that tunnels not operational  khary that tunnels not operational weve got two ways out here i see  matt you have this way which appears to go deeper into the mine  travis yeah not that way nope  matt this way which backtracks where you guys come from  travis thats the one  taliesin do we need to escort them or can we send them up to the surface  liam you know what we could do 
dung	 if we want to check this cave for more people is that we could  bring them up to the cart and i could do that one spell that i have that would let me know down here  if anything is happening up there  laura yeah  liam yeah if the little bell goes off in my head then i know that either that somethings coming out  laura the good bell not the bad bell  liam the good kind ja we would know more or less not 100 percent perfect but pretty close then we  
none	 could come back down here quickly and see if theres anyone else who needs help  marisha how long is it going to take to hike back the way we came  matt not too long maybe 20 or so minutes back to the surface  marisha lets do it  khary thats not bad  sam are we going to leave some folks down here to  laura no  sam what if they repopulate all of these rooms that weve already cleared  travis we should move together theres no point in leaving just a few  taliesin 
dung	 if you leave your alarm up here  liam well i was thinking about getting them to safety outside if anything leaves the mine well  know it was them  taliesin thats fair then yeah thats a good plan  laura lets do it  sam i dont like this plan at all what if someone what if one of the gnolls wanders into  this room and sees five of his dead brothers  laura lets throw them down the hole  taliesin we start kicking them right up to the edge kicking them right in the hole 
none	  matt one after another you take the remainders of the previous battle and roll them into the hole  in the center  khary good call  laura now they all look like they just left and had some  sam theres a whole other room with dead bodies in it that we also caused and also ball bearings  taliesin oh people die all the time  laura you know sometimes accidents happen  travis well be coming right back down we just need to get them to safety  liam you know people dont bare balls all 
none	 the time but i think its a reasonable risk at this  point in time  travis plus we could take a short rest up top while were getting them folks to safety  sam all right  taliesin i like this plan  sam are there any other boxes or things to search down here before we get out  matt you can search if you want to  laura yeah lets search around  marisha oh my god i crack boxes like fucking zelda  travis quietly maybe  marisha quiet sorry  laura how many dead bodies 
none	 do you think i could carry  matt you could drag two  taliesin ill take a couple as well  matt because youre pretty strong you could drag two bodies  laura im going to try to drag some of the dead out  matt everybody else can take one each i think based on your strengths you can take none  khary yeah my dragging days are over  taliesin were going to look around see if theres anything of interest  matt all right so two of you can make investigation checks on this one  liam 
none	 i will help you look because i have an eye  laura you need glasses though  liam no i have very trust me i mean i could roll for shit but  marisha hes nearsighted  laura oh nearsighted i understand  liam thats okay  marisha but you have advantage  liam do i have advantage  marisha because hes assisting you  matt if hes assisting you yeah  liam thats a little better oh yeah its good thats 15 you know for level three fünfzehn  travis chanting level three level three  matt in a 
none	 quick glance through a lot of it appears to be pickaxes shovels most in here  seems to be tools and anything of worth has been ravaged or taken you find a few bits of rotted  meat of indeterminate origin that you immediately shrink away from  liam no actually im going to scoop up some of those pieces of rotted meat and put them in my  pockets  matt okay there you go  liam you cant smell it  sam no it smells good to me  travis could be good bait later  liam thats 
none	 why im taking it  sam any baubles or little doodads  matt nothing in this chamber unfortunately this one has either been picked clean or didnt contain  anything of immediate worth in the process  sam oh i dont care about worth  matt i mean there are plenty of bodies you could rummage through if you wanted to but  laura as were walking them notts going through the pockets  khary anything explosive  matt you can make an investigation check if youd like  khary all right how would i do that  matt roll 
none	 a d20 and add your investigation skill bonus  liam its there by good roll  khary plus one  liam yeah 15 for him  matt 15 as well all right so not in this chamber in particular but as you guys are going  through the other tunnel you glance over in one of the overturned boxes and you find another  familiar object one of which you had used previously another singular stick with a long  explosive wick on the end you have another piece with you  khary gingerly i take it up  sam 
none	 gently you should be careful with that those can make big booms  khary this aint my first rodeo baby thank you  sam flustered noise  matt as he says that and turns you watch as the small black hummingbird perches on his shoulder as  he continues to walk  sam hes got a frumpkin too  laura im dragging the bodies going duchess duchess stacy please come over to me duchess  stacy  khary grand duchess  laura grand duchess stacy  travis we make our way back up to the top  matt ill have 
none	 you all you cant make stealth checks youre dragging bodies whos carrying  how many bodies are you bringing back  taliesin travis liam marisha and matt one  laura two  matt thats four five six seven  sam i will go ahead of the party to run point  matt make a perception check for me  sam 11  matt okay you guys carefully make your way back up through trying not to drag the bodies over  heavy bumps or rocks eventually making your way out of the main entrance way you notice a trap  
none	 that you had deftly avoided multiple times getting people in and out of a large tree trunk that had  been suspended in the roof to swing down when triggered had been triggered and is now hanging  there apparently somebody made an unfortunate mistake making their way through you all  eventually find your way out into the daylight once more the woman whos now introduced herself  as herma and the older halfelf man petrov all step out into the light blinking bleary in the  sudden influx of light as soon as you make it into the 
dung	 open sky you can see this breath of  relief wash over both of them and the young boy is now starting to come to consciousness again  goes mom she goes shh its okay its okay she looks up over towards shakäste and has  more tears in her eyes and goes thank you  sam i helped too  laura i stabilized him i stabilized him real good  matt thank you all so much you lead them over through the hills here that cluster around where  this mine once was around the corner there appears to 
none	 be a shed thats been long abandoned  and locked up as you approach you have been here previously  khary i take my reed stick and rap on the door  matt is that you  khary shh  matt the door opens and there you can see emerging four survivors also from alfield that  with bright eyes welcome the arrival of this strange traveler as well as the three other  survivors youve brought in as some of them begin to reunite with people that are familiar to them  people who live in alfield and know 
none	 each other they begin to hold each other and take a moment to  relish in this renewed moment of life then they begin to pour over the bodies that have been  recovered and they begin to identify them to each other and then sadness takes over then once  those waves have passed individuals begin to go up and thank you and take your hand and a few of  them are like anything i can give you please just let me know thank you so much its a lot  to have at once and for many 
none	 of you an experience that is different and new take it as you will  however you wish to but you also know time is of the essence and not too much time can be spent on  this  liam i would say that i did not partake in any of that as soon as we exited efficiently i pulled  out the silver thread and im already doing my thing while they do that  khary i would say to the people inside stay safe stay here i look at everyone else and say  this isnt over 
none	  marisha and khary lets go  liam and marisha lets go  travis thats a badass motherfucker im just saying  marisha yeah im so about it hes so cool  travis i know number one fan club  liam i guess we do not need a perception check  matt all the bodies are placed in a small pile and a large heavy piece of canvas material is  placed over them to hide them the shed is closed and locked and they all seem to feel at least  for the moment comfort and safety in this 
none	 space as you all begin to delve once more into the mines  beneath the hills i would like you all to make a stealth check please as you progress further in  liam oh good thats my specialty  laura ooh i could give someone a blessing whos shitty at this blessing  liam thank you ugh  travis ugh  khary what am i doing  travis 15  sam and laura roll a 20  khary roll the 20  marisha 25  liam eight  laura with advantage  liam ja  laura fuck  liam 
dung	 you brought me from a four to a seven  laura oh jesus  khary 17  sam 13  laura and taliesin 18  matt universally you guys are all confident in your ability to delve without being seen even  making up for those who maybe not have been a less bumbling experience making their way in  liam i stubbed my toe  marisha shh  laughter  taliesin learn how to see in the bloody dark  khary youve got light boy youll be fine  matt you make your way back through the familiar tunnel 
none	 and you can now see that the right tunnel  the one that you had previously seen the pitfall and decided to not head down into is now a large  cluster of rock and rubble  laura oh thats where you came from  khary mm  matt you progress down through the ritual area carefully avoiding a scattering of metallic ball  bearings across the floor you see an altar with candles on it that have all burned down entirely  except for a few tiny flickers is there any light source you guys are bringing down here 
none	 with you  liam spell effect  matt all right the balls of light now float as you progress giving everyone who needs it sight  you head down into the familiar chamber where this last fray occurred carefully avoiding the large  hole in the ground this is the only other exit from this chamber you continue forward whos  taking point and what is the marching order please  laura keep checking for traps okay  sam all right thats a good idea  khary can i send the grand duchess  matt you may  taliesin im 
none	 not getting over that  laura oh the grand duchess and frumpkin will be best of friends  marisha do they like each other  liam frumpkin was obliterated  khary stay away from my bird  liam you know its funny because only about 30 minutes ago i also had a bird but he was  obliterated  marisha oh thats right  liam it was very sad ill bring him back tomorrow  khary thanks for that  laughter  liam he and i we are like that  travis its going on its going  sam hes 
none	 very charming  laura i feel like were seeing more of calebs social awkwardness seeing him from the outside  its so good  taliesin its everything i couldve wanted  matt as you take a moment to continue focusing as you do through the vision of your bird  hovering hum coasts down through the tunnel before you to keep an eye out  make a perception check for your bird please roll a d20 and add two to it  khary 17  matt 17 nice the birds perception not his  matt thats great the tunnel descends 
none	 at a moderate grade for about 80 to 100 feet before it  levels off once more ahead you see a set of rough stairs that rise for about five or six feet  leading to the remainder of the tunnel and then curving to the left suddenly out of sight  slightly along this elevation right there you have your bird hovering hum and right as the  stairs ascend and turn immediately there is the outer corner of a gnoll stands there  waiting keeping watch gnoll murmurs do you want to send your bird in further to 
dung	 check out the  rest of the room or pull it back  khary shes quick  matt shes pretty quick  khary i say move on  matt all right hovering hum okay  laura its really smart that he made a  hummingbird thats really fast  taliesin its really clever  laura its a pretty smart move dont you think  liam its not a cat  sam one that can see in the dark  laura yeah i mean its really smart  matt as the duchess moves further and up to the platform the duchess 
none	 can see another portion of  the floor that is collapsed inward into another falling pit that rests against the wall on the  opposite side of where these stairs ascend the tunnel curves to the left immediately where this  hole is on the top and where it continues down there appears to be a large archway where there  was once a set of double doors the doors have been broken off the hinges and are not visible at  current sight but to each side of the frame you can see two skeletal gnolls with bits of 
none	 flesh and  skin hanging off their bones and rib cage and snout sitting there like silent undead sentinels  looking around  khary thank you so much come back to me dear  matt hovering hum charging back to the tunnel back to your shoulder  khary we have a friend about a hundred feet away hes by himself but yeah theres just the one  beyond him there is more to deal with i think we quietly take care of this gentleman first and  then we move on  laura did you see any survivors  khary 
none	 not yet but there are two sentinels and they are guarding something im hoping thats  someone  travis perhaps we can create a little bit of a lure to bring back that single fellow closer to us  and we dispatch him quietly  khary its not a bad idea  marisha i reached into the ball bearings that i have left since i have about half i take one and  go ball bearing bouncing  matt down along to the grade ball bearing bouncing eventually you can no longer hear any  noise the ball bearing makes 
none	 as it continues out of your earshot  liam im also going with the dancing lights theyre not leading the way the closest one is  actually ten feet behind us like a choochoo train back behind the group so that its dim light 20 to  30 feet ahead of us  matt okay a minute passes two minutes you dont see any indication that anything noticed  or heard  marisha ah shit hes stupid  laura maybe hes sleeping  travis whos real good at dispatching them quiet  marisha nott do you want to  sam

none	 slides up  from under you  marisha oh shit  matt you try and catch yourself and you manage to do so but you dislodge a rock that begins making  more noise than the ball bearing did at which point you hear growls and howl  sam does it see us  matt its down below the grade and out of sight its just the rock that began to make its way down  travis i screwed the pooch i think yall need to fucking join us  marisha come back  laura we cant hear you youre 
none	 fucking 60 feet ahead of us  travis it was a really loud stage whisper  laughter  travis echoing sper sper sper  laughter  sam i will tell them all right ill point back to them and i will bring out my little piece of  fabric wait no its a piece of wire and whisper into it and send a message to caleb that weve  been made start making your way down here  laughter  liam oh verdammt it didnt work were in trouble they are coming i think theyre coming  laura should we

none	 you big men making these weird speeches to me  laughter  sam all right sure i feel inspired again ill take a swig  matt you do take a heavy swig off of your flask thank you both wait carefully holding your action  until underneath you can see what emerges below the lowest part of the curving tunnel roof a  gnoll snout begins to protrude past you can see the arrow already nocked in the longbow as it  turns down and turns and glances up the tunnel to meet your guys vision  travis as soon 
none	 as he fires i will as well  sam i will fire my hand how far  matt right now hes about 30 feet below you  sam yeah i can make that shot ping  laughter  matt go ahead and roll an attack  taliesin oh dear  sam ten  travis oh me  matt yep  travis 15  matt just hits misses  marisha 15 is the magic number  travis can i say my bonus i move my hex over to him  matt at this point your hex has faded  travis fair

none	 get my ki point back  liam i would get a spell back yeah  travis i think we should we rescued the survivors we gave them a little moment to  grieve  laura i mean there might be more survivors  travis i know but  laura we rescued some survivors  travis yeah  liam we say ja  travis yes  liam ja  laura we took a rest  matt all right so before we jump into this well say you took the short rest which is an  hour so you guys can use 
none	 your hit dice you hadnt taken any damage shakäste so you dont  have to worry about it  khary no but i was just thinking about because i did use the thunderwave  matt that does not come back on a short rest  khary that does not come back okay  matt yeah its a long rest for you  background music  marisha jesus shitty rolls  sam is there a way to track the hit dice in singing dd beyond  matt yes under hit points  travis yeah you hit short rest and it will 
none	 pop up the number of hit dice you have  matt its under the short rest  laura yeah under short rest not hit  sam yeah okay  matt all righty so with that the case youve taken a short rest now back to the current  moment you both fired you missed you succeeded to hit go ahead and roll your damage on that  travis thank you 1d10 plus four that is a ten plus four 14  matt 14 points of damage all righty as it looks up and gets hit in the snout and it 
none	 looks back up  and you can see the black charred exterior of its head one of its eyes is now ruined and he  growls its tongue is dangling out you can see blood and slobber across the front of its chest as  it looks up and gets ready to release its bow strike at you since you made the hit thats going  to be a 23 to hit  travis oh that definitely hits  matt natural 18 thats an eight on the die that is ten points of piercing damage to you  travis damn 
none	  marisha travis and liam singing damn damn damn  taliesin i was watching this i was going to head down this direction anyway  matt right at this point you guys have now begun to head down yeah  matt you guys head down its going to take the better part of the turn to get to where they are  unfortunately because you guys were waiting at the very top as soon as you see the lights go off  suddenly and the impact of the spell from him and hear the snarling in the distance you guys 
none	 begin  to make a full beeline and it takes you the full dash and movement to even get beside your allies  you guys get another round as well as the gnoll so go ahead and make your attacks  sam all right  laura you can do it  sam i can do it  travis here we go  sam sure 18 to hit  matt 18 hits  travis 21  matt hits roll damage no sneak attack unfortunately  sam five  matt all right damage on you  travis on my bonus action ill 
none	 cast hex as well thats five points of necrotic  khary is my guidance still helping at all  matt the guidance only helps for the next six seconds so it helped him with the stealth check  originally you can do it whenever you want to as an action  travis eight points of damage five necrotic for 13 total  matt as the gnoll pulling back its arrows about to give out a large bellowing cry makes a large  inhale as it pulls back a second arrow and then both of you slam into it and watch 
none	 as it falls to  the ground dropping its weapons that clatter against the stonework its not longer moving as  you guys catch up  laura i go running past them right as they do it and cut its ears off  taliesin im opening up the jar there you are  laura thank you  travis pull it back into the tunnel  laura oh okay i do that  matt okay you drag it back in while youre down you make perception checks please  taliesin both of us  sam her forearms are amazing  matt 
none	 if youre helping yeah both of you  marisha theyre bats just baseball bats with arms  laura 15  taliesin 13  matt as you rush down and grab the body you glance up and whereas previously he described  there was the singular gnoll and the two other skeletal ones in the opposite side it appears  that since it was given some indication of nearby sounds and it made that brief call before it began  to approach there are a few more gnolls that have appeared at the top of the platform above where  the 
none	 stairs crest  laura do they see us  matt no they do not at the moment but only because theyre not looking at your direction as  soon as you see it you immediately drag the body out of the way i would like you both make a  stealth check to try to quietly drag the body back  laura 16  taliesin 20  matt you both dont drag it you both grab an arm and a leg and very painfully lift it up without  making any sound and pull it out of range up the 
none	 grade out of view as you watch one of the gnolls  turns its face in your direction barely passing seeing you guys yank it out of sight  laura whispering theres a lot more guys out there  marisha whispering how many  matt you saw three visually appear  laura i saw three visually  travis fucking beau and her ball bearings  sam why did you drop a ball bearing down there  matt to give you perspective on this because it looks like were going on that direction  cheering  laura oh god this means 
tavern	 that  marisha its like a motion simulator ride whoa  taliesin fun fact matts house is actually made of dwarven forge  marisha its true  taliesin every wall the kitchen  laura that would be amazing  taliesin its just dwarven forge all the way through  marisha no i dont know  liam you havent lived until youve slept on dwarven forge  matt you now see  marisha or our beds not on braziers no  laura and liam critical role critical role  liam oh god weve got to stop  taliesin i know this 
none	 has to end  matt this leads into the grade that head up in an angle here where you guys originally shot the  gnoll and dragged him out of the way  liam we are down that way  matt you guys are over  liam over this way  matt youre up in the tunnel here it angles down there and this is where  laura oh no theyre coming whispering they were about to look in this direction but they  werent quite looking in that direction when we dragged the body out  marisha whispering okay 
none	  khary theyre not exactly  matt they havent noticed anything yet you guys are up in this way and this is the layout here  laura fjord what do we do  sam dont do anything yet we have to figure out what were doing  khary well im meaning simply as a strategy should we use something to distract them since  theyre already not looking our way so that we could get a few shots at their back  laura can you send the grand duchess in  khary i absolutely will can we start there  
none	 matt you may yeah  khary lets do that find a safe perch my dear  matt the grand duchess makes her way down to the tunnel up lets see if they see her  sam is she really royalty  khary thats what she told me  laura did she used to be a person and you shrunk her down  khary no she is who she is baby just like you  matt she passes them over there is one perch up on the side of the wall right above where this  large pit is on the 
none	 opposite end she perches right over the side as two of the gnolls are still  growls one of them begins to look over the table and underneath for any possible source of  the noise earlier one of them glances over his shoulder as the duchess enters begins to pull an  arrow out of the quiver  khary come back here baby  matt bird noise growl  khary thaumaturgy  sam oh no its on  marisha do it  khary thaumaturgy im sorry  taliesin im going to use my bonus action just before this happens 
dung	 and im going to activate the  second sword  matt okay you reduce your max hit points  travis i roll to maintain concentration because he hit me after i cast hex  matt yes please constitution saving throw  travis oh no yeah thats a six  matt six no thats a failure you lose hex sorry buddy  laura oh no  travis got to be honest with him  khary thaumaturgy can i brighten the room how dark is it in here  matt its pitch black aside from the globes of light that he has 
none	 theres nothing to make  brighter in there  liam its bright behind us not in front of us so much  khary lets see then if its  laura you can shake the ground though  khary yes lets shake the ground so however well he thinks he can aim takes him off kilter  matt for that instance make a standard wisdom check for me roll a d20 and add your wisdom  modifier which i think is  liam oh thats a 19 natural roll  matt as you feel the duchess return to you and just 
none	 past the vision as the duchess passes over  you hear the sound of the fingers gliding across the bowstring you hear the creak of the wood as  its pulled back you know exactly what that sound means as you see through the duchesss eyes you  focus on the ground below and cause it to quake somewhat rolled a natural five plus four with  that shaking it causes the its very localized in the area the gnoll yip as it does it  releases the arrow and it whips past and shatters across the rock the duchess 
none	 returns to your shoulder  khary well now im pissed  sam do they know were here now  laura he saw the bird come back this way so maybe  liam and sam its just a bird  liam he might have even thought it was a bat  sam should we all turn into birds and confuse him  laura do you know how to do that  sam and laura i could try  khary lets try later why dont we do things weve done before  laughter  matt what are you guys doing  marisha 
none	 are we doing this  laura lets fucking go  sam were going to go in or this doesnt seem very smart i dont know  laura i rub her head and give her a little blessing dont you worry you keep hiding  whenever you need it  sam what is this blessing  laura it gives you advantage on stealth checks  sam oh okay thank you  matt if this is the case what are you guys doing  marisha do we get a surprise round  sam no they know were here  khary no they 
dung	 dont know were here  marisha or an earthquake were in a shaft things shake a lot  matt theyre aware of something in the vicinity the first gnoll announced there was something  fishy they dont know what it is or where you are but theyre on guard  liam surprised is like a condition like poison but they know something is  laura not surprised  khary if i used sacred flame on one because if its dark in there and one of them burst into  flames wouldnt they all look in that direction  matt its 
dung	 possible  khary lets try that  laura i could sacred flame him in the exact same time  travis while were waiting can i cast armor of agathys on myself  matt you may  khary i like this  travis hissing sound i pull the moisture  out of the air and it forms frost all over me  marisha its got a little moss on it from the cave  matt as you have this conversation you turn back and you watch as fjord the rather handsome  looking halforc finishes muttering something under his breath and 
dung	 the shadows coalesce into  this dark cold icy armor that shatter into bits of shards around the exterior of his leather  armor you watch as this mist rises off of it  travis everybody chill  liam no you ruined it it was so good  marisha it wasnt cool when arnold said it  travis wait everybody be cool  laughter  sam stay frosty stay frosty  laura i pull my sickle out so im prepared for actual upfront combat  taliesin ive got both of those sticks going im ready for this  matt this 
none	 guys moved forward to here this guys moved forward to there theyre in the process of  searching the area looking down the tunnel  laura which one do you want to hit the orange one the gray one or the black one  khary did we see those other ones over there  matt you saw them the skeletal ones there  khary thats what i thought i thought my baby saw them i say i think we need to get those  fellows to turn back and look at those fellows  laura we cant see those guys 
none	 to sacred flame them  khary i cant see them anymore  matt you guys are up in this tower right now so youd have to send duchess back in to see  khary isnt that always the way  laura we could get the one in the back and then the other two might look at him  khary i think thats a great idea darling  laura lets do it  liam can i say i change my mind every five minutes about whether this group was a good idea  or a terrible idea and im listening 
none	 to these chuckleheads talk to each other and im waiting  to cast blur on myself when it looks like everybodys going to do something but im waiting  until the last minute  laura i knew it was blur  liam good for you you get a doughnut  khary sacred flame on the gentleman in blue  laura at the same time i see his little reed flick im going to swirl my sickle around and  cast toll the dead  matt all right on this guy there  laura and khary yeah  matt as you 
none	 guys slowly bring your way to the base which in order to get you in the space  where you can see them that would put both of you rushing right down to the base in that area if i  can get a marching order to where the rest of you are by the way  liam hey ill be in the back  marisha ill take the front  taliesin lets take a line of the three of us at least  travis yep im good with that  matt you guys rush forward to take the line

none	 save for you thats a 13  laura 13  matt yeah it succeeds sorry for you its 13 as well for your dc that is a five  laura you couldnt have them roll that for me  matt sorry  laughter  sam its crystal pepsi  laura i really love crystal pepsi  taliesin original run  matt roll damage for the sacred flame which should be whats the damage on the spell  khary the damage on the sacred flame is the spells damage increases by 1d8 when you  matt yeah so its 1d8 go

none	 getting  ready to rush into the fray top of the round is shakäste  khary lets see frostbite  matt okay against which one  khary lets see oh wait first of all they burst into flames this gentleman burst into  flames and when that happened what did these gentlemen how did these gentlemen react  matt the two other gnolls glance over at the side and then look towards the tunnel where you  guys were it didnt seem like it was much of a distraction for them unfortunately in the moment  laura right as we 
none	 all ran in at the same time  matt unfortunately it wasnt a sourceless cluster as you guys all made your way to the base  khary all right then i say the one closest to us i will hit with frostbite  matt all right would that be that one there  khary that would be that fellow  matt all right go for it frostbite he has to roll against your dc so i roll it for you that  is a natural one so go ahead and roll damage on that  khary all right that is

none	 freezing inward and you watch as the gnoll gnoll pain sounds its shaking  briefly you watch as its muscles are beginning to slow down and become sluggish do you want to  move or do you want to stay where youre put  khary lets see actually i feel pretty good right behind these fellows  matt all right so you stay there that ends your turn the gnolls will now go the three of them  are going to begin to back away and theyre all going to take strikes with their bow  sam ranged attackers  
none	 matt they all pull out their arrows and each are going to make a strike the one you frostbit is  going to attack you it has disadvantage  sam guys lets all cluster up at the bottom of the stairs  marisha sounds great yeah  matt it was a three and a two with disadvantage so no it misses you entirely it actually gets  partially caught in the fro and makes its way to the back  khary oh man ive got beads in that thing baby got to be careful  matt missed them all thankfully 
none	 the next attack in the front is going to be against beau and then  ones going to be against molly since you guys are the most visually impressive of the front row  colorwise you blend into the surroundings a little bit comparatively so against molly man  they cannot roll that is a six  taliesin i slice it catch it in the spin  matt grinding sound just grinding toothpicks the one versus you beau that is a 14  marisha miss  matt dodge out of the way  sam devil sticks  khary i think

none	 youre doing that good job you look back just as two arrows go flying towards you from  the two other gnolls they both have disadvantage i believe right because you took your defensive stance  marisha yep  matt all right which is good because that wouldve been a 20 and an 11  marisha miss miss  matt well thats the first attack i rolled a 20 and 11 you dodge out of the way the second one  is going to be a 21 and a 22  matt that hits  marisha see if i can

none	 the bones clatter to the ground in a pile  taliesin im going to keep running and to get to the other side of that other gnoll  matt this one here  taliesin yeah actually if theres any way can i get all the way around him  matt counting yes there is  taliesin yeah i dont know if this is helpful but im going to take my second swing thats 18  to hit  matt that hits roll damage  matt you dont get the bonus to your wisdom but you still have the rite on

none	 from within  the haphazard hide i believe that ends your turn  taliesin that ends my turn  matt all righty end of mollys turn nott youre up  sam whimpers thats my turn  laughter  sam no i will run up behind shakäste and ill peek around and fire at the frosty one right in  front of jester  matt okay go for it  laura whispers frosty  sam yeah 24  matt 24 hits and you do get sneak attack because it is currently  sam yeah  laura engaged  taliesin so engaged

dung	 didnt go as well as i thought  matt thats all right  taliesin thats okay youve engaged them which means theyre less likely to use their bows  marisha thats true  matt that ends your turn caleb youre up  liam i dont really have a clear view of whats going on so i would on this wall here i would  inch five or ten feet up the cave to see whats going on  matt you get just about there  liam i see a gigantic gnoll and okay  matt the one that you saw

none	 leader of this cluster this pack the armor it has is  chunks of chainmail and hide armor that are patched together where a number of long thin  spines like heavy bonelike spikes have been woven into it like a decoration to make it look  extremely intimidating right as it grins and gets its glaive ready it gets blasted with three beams  of burning arcane energy as they hit and impact you watch as the flames curl up and it has to pat  it out with its giant hand snarling it took the hit like a 
none	 champ and it seems like its hurt but  its still doing pretty well  liam i wipe my arm down and say oh boy  matt is that your turn  liam yeah thats done  matt that was a good round that finishes calebs turn fjord youre up  travis i pick myself up out of my prone position there on the  matt well technically youre not prone sorry  travis i know i was commenting on the way i was laying can i come up to the top of the stairs  right there keeping some

none	 unfortunately its just a straight roll  marisha oh it doesnt  matt nope its a contested roll  travis you got this  liam chanting monk monk monk  laura glumly i know what he rolled  matt its a natural 20  yelling  matt you can come look at the snitch right now  marisha you did this if i die its on your head  taliesin you can make this go away at any time  matt make your acrobatics check its not an automatic success  sam just roll a natural 20  marisha oh 
none	 my god pick the dice that i use  liam a natural 20  matt its a 23 total it only has a plus three strength bonus so  liam this is clearly a case of the husband favoring the wife  marisha i dont want to die yelling ugh goddamn it that happened before  matt it was almost an 18 and it went to a four so he shoves you not actually with the shield  he pulls back and sparta kicks you right as you turn to try and defend whack it hits you right  in 
none	 the sternum and you get pushed back five feet which puts you right on the edge i need you to go  ahead and make a dexterity check to try and catch yourself  marisha make a what  matt dexterity saving throw  marisha saving throw panicked breathing im good at this  laura dont say those things marisha  taliesin yeah were not good at anything lets stop pretending that were good at anything  travis yeah because you did have patient dodge going right  marisha i had patient defense but  matt its against attack rolls 
none	 but i feel like i just saw something for dodge action and you  make dexterity saving throws with advantage  marisha i do  matt you do so roll with advantage  matt its a high dc you have to beat i think with this and the impact that hit you you have to  beat an 18 so go for it you have advantage  laura you can do it  liam advantage and have a good bonus  marisha i have to roll at least a 12  liam youve already fallen off one cliff youre not

none	 that was the dexterity saving throw  because it was a grate you suffer 11 points of bludgeoning damage which its not bad you fell  40 feet and landed on your back onto hard rocks and stones  taliesin could have been worse although you are our tank  marisha wheezing it knocks the air out of me so going to be sick i guess hit real good  normally 11 points  khary did the aid i give help at all with that  matt oh yeah  marisha oh right hang on  matt you have five

dung	 dust theres now this musky smell that resembles the faint mixture of  urine and citrus its hard to place but its new and its different than the rest of the mines  youve been through  liam its a step up for me  sam we got all the ears  laura we got all the ears should we search for more survivors and then burn it to the ground  liam like the mine  laura yeah  liam burn the mine to the ground under the ground  laura well we can explode it  taliesin you

dung	 matt as youre focused currently to the vision of your you do not sense  khary i do not sense a thing  matt you do not because currently all of your senses are through your familiar so unfortunately no  khary thats fine by me  taliesin do any of us notice this  sam i will use sleight of hand to conceal this from the group  matt you will have to so make a sleight of hand check  sam okay yeah okay thats not great  liam our guests are like farm animals that we mine

none	 matt you undo the pouch and now have it in your possession as youre focusing through the  duchesss vision beyond the broken doorway the tunnel grows rougher as you sense that the deeper  shafts of the mines are coming to an end fairly soon the scent the duchess is picking up is  strong that weird musky smell after about 100 feet of it snaking a little bit forward through  ten 15 foot wide tunnels suddenly the tunnel opens into a large rocky alcove formation  stalactites from the ceiling and some elements of broken digging equipment 
dung	 around the corners of  this chamber the uneven ceilings stand about 15 to 20 feet tall within in places and are scarred  with pick marks from various attempts to meet the end of the mine which apparently were not enough  to keep the mine in business a rough slope descends from the immediate entrance to this  tunnel hits the wall before it rises a few feet past that to a smaller platform that meets the  opposite side of the wall about 70 or 80 feet to the other side the chambers about 80foot from  
none	 where you enter to the opposite end near the base of the raised rock you see two humanoid figures  sitting against each other bound tightly in ropes and above the platform on top you see a figure  you havent seen yet humanlike but seems to have large chunks of gnoll flesh strapped to their  body like they used a disembodied gnoll arm as a glove a gnoll head with the jaw removed and  hollowed out used as a hood there is this individual carrying baubles and chains of some  symbols across their neck and theyre 
none	 spattered with blood theyre standing at the top currently  holding a third humanoid figure who is bound in ropes and dragging them up the stairs to this  platform on the opposite end next to this gnollwearing priestlylike figure you see the  figure in their arm is a guard one of the crownsguard of alfield you dont recognize him at  a glance but you can see they are currently still living bloodied and are being dragged up to the  top of this platform you can see right at the top of this raised section a monstrous 
dung	 mound of broken  wood rope burlap and scrap from nearby within the mine that has been amassed into this large  pile at that moment a majority of the mound begins to move and shift as two large brown red  leathery wings unfurl from the mound where a furcovered body steps out is the duchess going  to stay and continue to watch  khary i can explain what is happening as she sees  matt you can you are describing this verbally to everybody  khary yes absolutely  laura what should we do what should we 
dung	 do  khary we should wait and see what else unfurls in this thing  matt this creature stands up from within this pile you can now see this large lionlike body  and torso the size of a rhinoceros massive and muscled with giant clawed paws around the neck  you see this thick red fiery mane of hair and a humanoid female face dark and tanned with this  large curled grin the mouth that opens and hangs with rows of sharp teeth but weirdly humanoid in  appearance it turns its head towards this priestly figure who 
none	 thrusts the guard to the  front and says come gifted mother feed and may you grow strong your strength is a boon from  yeenoghu and one that will bring us much more meat in the time to come and kicks the guard  forward this large beast turns and inspects the frightened shaking and sobbing guard your god  meats hold me to nothing but your offer pleases me and my child as the beast stands up further  in this pile of rough found pieces of wood and twine a small infant of its same species seems 
none	 to  be wound up and begins to mewl in its place its pawing at the air its eyes not even freshly  opened this creature steps forward and bites into the crownsguard and lifts it up as he begins to  scream the rest of you hear the echoing screaming in the distance of the crownsguard  laura i think that means he ate him  matt as it begins to bite and crunch pulling its jaw open it tears it into two halves and begins  to chew on the upper torso the screaming has stopped  sam 
none	 get your medical kit ready  laura dont think its going to help  khary there are two people left  matt there are two people left in the room and you can look around the vicinity it looks like  there were more people in here that have probably been fed over the past hour  khary this sacrifice will not end first duchess come back to me  laura should we go in  khary we should talk this is going to take a minute  matt thankfully nobody seems to notice duchesss presence as duchess retracts back 
none	 into your chamber  taliesin how flammable is that nest  laura i meant its  khary how far is the nest away  matt its past 100 feet of tunnel before it opens up into the chamber which is another 80 feet from  the entrance  sam how big was the chamber  liam 80 feet  sam oh my god  matt to give you a visual  sam a visual matt theres too many maps  taliesin singing too many maps too many maps  khary oh look at this thing  matt so you can 
none	 prepare  sam that what  sam that is upper level shit  laura what are we doing were level three what are we doing we got to go in we got to throw  some dynamite get the people out and run  khary we got one stick  laura we got two sticks  travis i dont see any support columns im just going to say it  taliesin no we hit the nest set the nest on fire and itll run  travis yeah you got to get pretty danger close to do that though ive got 
dung	 to stand up and look  make sure theres no damn holes  taliesin oh yeah good point yep  matt no holes in the chamber from what you can see  travis thats the baby the little thing  matt yeah  travis okay no load bearing support columns that we can see right  matt not that you can see no there are various portions in the ceiling that are stalactites it  looks like its the deepest part of the mine which is the roughest which means it does not  have a lot of support structure 
dung	 built into it for the miners this like its as deep as they got  before they abandoned it from the veins dried up  travis before shit started going wrong  matt this mine has been long abandoned the recent occupants seem to have discovered it and  taken it their own  khary well personally im a fan of freedom of religion but thats got its limits  taliesin its fair to draw a line at human sacrifice  khary i think so  taliesin yeah lets  sam we cant possibly kill whatever that beast is  
none	 liam i dont know maybe not on our own two at a time im pretty tapped but theres a lot of us  here and only a few of them there according to our new friend  sam but theres only two survivors in there right  travis two survivors and two enemies right  marisha yeah but what happens if they get sacrificed  sam no i mean what if we just get the survivors out and leave  marisha i think thats smart  khary i tend to agree with my little friend  laura and we steal 
dung	 the baby  liam we could also try and seal the cave behind us as we go  taliesin sealing the cave would be one thing i think stealing the baby is going to be a bit of a  travis i love your enthusiasm but i tend to agree with molly here maybe the baby just stays put  marisha if we can get the baby i bet it would fetch a high price  sam a baby should be with its mother  laura yeah we might kill the mom though or bury it  travis i think 
none	 im okay with that  sam as long as they are close to each other  travis it just ate a crownsguard in half  laura lets get it out and then collapse the tunnel leading to it then they can get stuck in  this room  marisha all right  liam could we do a quick inventory check of how much of these boom sticks that we have the tnt  laura we have one and one  khary i have one  liam we have more than one you have one  khary i have one

none	 noise and call a lot of attention and then  maybe you could sneak through  taliesin you could do two spiritual weapons if youre feeling it  laura i know but then i have no spells left i got a first level yall  khary i think because i used aid i think ive got  matt you have one 2ndlevel spell and you have three 1stlevel i believe  khary yes no ive got two 1stlevels because i used thunderwave and command  matt thats correct you have two 1stlevels you have three spells left  khary why

none	 to curl forward stealthing around the side  as the ball bearing ting ting ting both the priest and the manticore whip over in that  direction the priest pulls a glove on its hand thats a dull red color that begins to sparkle  and glow at the tips of the fingers and tightens it on its hand and begins to step down the stairs  a bit in the direction of that  sam im going behind those stalagmites over there  matt over here  sam no like  matt over here  sam yeah  laura 
none	 all the way around  matt okay whereas the female manticore flapping the wind picks up and dust begins  to spiral and briefly obfuscates the area the manticore flies with an impact lands on the  opposite side right where the ball bearing is and sniffs company all right what are you guys doing  sam im going straight for the mage hand to untie them  matt make a sleight of hand check from a distance well this would be a straight dexterity  check roll dexterity not sleight of hand  sam dexterity check  matt add

none	 splash of water spatters across the ground as a  slightly curved at the tip falchion appears that has a cluster of barnacles along the base of it  and slowly curling up the blade and sea water dripping off of it at all times leaving a trail of liquid  travis 23  matt that hits  taliesin yeah  matt this thing is pretty big its not too hard to hit comparatively  travis 13 points of damage slashing damage  liam what did you roll to hit  travis the ten twohanded that is it  matt

none	 around the corner out of the corner of its eye it sees you as it spins its  giant spined tail which you can see now which looks like a porcupine filled with javelins  rushes past and slams into your shoulder as you do your sickle flies out of your hand and  clatters across the ground and hits the floor at the bottom of the stairs that is where your  sickle currently is  laura oh no  matt end of your turn jester  taliesin bonus action anything  travis bonus action to run your ass 
none	  laura im going to just dance in place  matt all righty nott your turn  sam bonus action use the mage hand to untie the other one  matt all right make another dexterity check  sam 19 plus four  matt with that the other persons rope falls free and theyre both out of their ropes theyre both  looking at the only exit that is currently blocked by this giant manticore creature they look  scared and have no idea whats happening they havent seen you for some reason their ropes have  dropped and theyre 
none	 scared shitless they arent guards these two look like civilians and theyre  having a really rough time  sam sighs should i waste my action on this shit im still hidden yeah  matt as far as you know  taliesin theres also another dude  sam another dude oh you mean the bad guy  matt theres the priest  sam yeah not another good guy  sam ah fuck im going to use message and point to one of the guards that i just untied  matt theyre not guards theyre civilians  sam or whatever the 
none	 civilians and say to him the second after the priest casts a spell grab  your friend and run  matt make a persuasion check  sam nine  matt okay you deliver the message thats as far as you know  sam then for my movement im going to tuck in even tighter  matt okay all right that finishes your turn it is now the manticores go it is going to make  three attacks a bite and two claw attacks its going to make two claw attacks actually its  going to make one sweeping claw attack 
none	 at jester from behind and then a bite and a claw attack at  you since youre right in front of it and already struck it with your falchion  taliesin first ones disadvantage  matt first ones at disadvantage which would be against jester as you rush past that is a 17  and a 19  laura hits me  matt yeah it hits you thats without bonuses unfortunately you take from the first strike nine  points of slashing damage as it woosh it rolled high a nine again then two strikes  against you  laura 
none	 im going to cast hellish rebuke at it as soon as it does it  matt okay whats the save it was a natural 20 on you fjord unfortunately the other claw attack  travis oh player ive got the armor of agathys on  marisha oh thats right  laura it doesnt say on my thing its a dex save  matt a dex save all right that is a 12  laura oh  matt so that hits all right go ahead and roll damage  laura 3d10 im going to say in infernal  sam 3d10

none	 in doing so it spins around with its other claw and strikes right into fjord with a natural  20 it rolled a one on the fucking damage die so youre fucking lucky on that thats twice in this  game its kind of disappointing on my end but its fine so thats five points of slashing damage  travis and hell take ten points of cold damage  matt thats right  marisha so sick  taliesin were at our best when were losing  matt as it strikes with its second claw attack against you and the ice 
none	 cracks and it looks at  you and the mouth opens wide and you can see where three separate rows of teeth like this horrible  shark maw as it reaches forward to bite towards you the head itself about maybe this wide the  jaw can almost clamp down onto your waist jurassic park style thats going to be a 16 to hit  travis 16 hits  laura oh no  liam wheres your ac  travis 14  liam youre grog  travis nope  matt thats ten points of piercing damage from the bite to you 
none	  travis great he takes another ten points of cold damage as my armor of  matt she  travis she thank you as my armor of agathys  matt interesting in this quick series of hits shes doing fine but this is an unexpected burst  of damage and you can see harryings starting to show a powerful creature can do some powerful  damage but is showing a little bit of wear and tear with that the manticore is going to take to  the sky  taliesin singing take to the sky  matt its going to 
none	 fly up  laura do we get an attack of opportunity  matt you both do yes  laura ah im going to kick it  matt you can punch it make an attack  laura no i dont hit it  matt what did you roll  laura i rolled a three  travis do i get an attack  matt you do yes  travis i dont think thats going to hit either thats an eight  matt nope you both whoosh the giant gust of wind from the wings flapping push you away and you  have

none	 baby what do i need to roll  matt roll a d20 plus five with advantage because it is prone so roll a d20 twice and take the  higher of the two  khary roll the 20 twice  matt correct  khary nine three  laura nine plus five  matt nine plus five is 14 that is just its armor class that hits it has an armor class of 14 so  roll damage on that d8 plus three  khary d8 plus three thats this one all right four four plus three is seven  matt 
none	 seven points of damage as the bust slams into the manticore after your musings pierced its  soul its going to attempt to make a saving throw with advantage  laura with advantage why with advantage  matt its a two because whenever it takes an impact from an attack it gets an advantage on the  saving throw to break it a two and a five however  cheering  marisha aw baby  matt its okay it happens its good its cinematic its fun thats your bonus action you  still have an action  khary i still 
none	 have an action  matt yes you do  khary well then lets see where am i  liam did you use all your slots  laura you got healing in there  sam was that a bonus action to use the weapon  matt yeah so you still have an action if you want to cast another spell or do something else as  an action  khary lets see how is everybody feeling right now  taliesin not too good  khary not too good  matt the priest is already dead the manticores pretty hurt some of

none	 the flames that start to light  on the edges of my fingers as i slowly bring them together theres a musical interlude that starts  to play and shoots towards the manticore diving down her throat and bursting through the chest of  her and exploding her heart you know what i did that out of love for someone who just lost their child  matt there you go as shakäste smiles the merciful grin of a person who knows that the loss  of a child is hard you release this torrent of sound energy into the cackling 
none	 mouth of the female  manticore as the writhing stops and she begins to stand up looking down looks back at the  corpse of the child now laid still looks back at you with a look of pity and acceptance before  explosion there is a burst of gore out of the chest and the creature just falls to the ground  motionless the wings flopping onto the ground still and silence takes the chamber  silence  travis well time to light the tnt lets go  taliesin im going to douse the flames im going to run 
none	 down to the priest and douse the flames  and then give caleb a good slap on the face  matt okay caleb comes to  liam slapping  taliesin hey back in the game time for that later you all right  liam yeah  taliesin all right big kiss on the forehead and then walking away  marisha and khary im  khary no please  marisha i was just going to say im going to do a quick scan see if theres anything of interest  matt make a perception check  marisha copy natural 19 22 
dung	  matt amongst the chunks of flesh and rather horrible attire theres a couple of interesting  adornments on the priest the nest looks like its a mishmash of all kinds of things cobbled  together  marisha ill definitely take the adornments from the priest  matt okay from that there was a set of goggles that were affixed over the priests eyes of a  dark lens  marisha can i see if i can see in the dark i need night vision goggles  liam you do  matt there is also that reddish glove that was 
none	 affixed to his right hand  laura dont touch it i wonder if that makes spells better gasps  travis ill run up onto the nest and start looking for stuff  matt make an investigation check for me please  taliesin you all right there you all right  sam never better  travis natural 20  laura yay find all the shit  matt no shit whats the total there for that  travis 24  matt all right as you tear through the rubble of this nest you find a few interesting things a  skeletal hand 
none	 that has been mostly chewed through though a single fleshy finger still holds a ring  of beautiful silver make and a blue gem that catches your attention what at first looks like  part of the wooden riffraff that makes the nest you pull out a refined and wellcarved stick that  doesnt match the rest of the rather rough wood  taliesin i know im so excited our first loot  laura this is so exciting  matt also tangled within the mass you find chains but larger than normal chains these chains  are attached to a 
none	 set of unlocked manacles much larger than any human manacles youve seen there  are four identical loops a little over one foot in diameter all attached via this chain to one  larger one about four feet in diameter  sam thats huge  marisha was it for the manticore  matt it looks like it would have been the size for a manticore since you rolled so high in  investigation you also notice that these manacles which are open have a single rune  pressed into where they meet and lock in place as there is no 
none	 other visible locking mechanism you  are unable to really at the moment ascertain the nature of it these manacles are fresh theyre  clean compared to all the other stuff in here they are there  marisha are the runes recognizable in any way  matt make an arcana are you proficient in arcana  travis ill make an arcana check  matt are you proficient in arcana  travis i have a pretty high bonus i dont think im proficient in it  liam i would like to sit on my ass and look at the ground  
none	 travis i am proficient in it  matt make an arcana check please  travis seven  matt youre unable to really ascertain the nature of the runes unfortunately  laura im going to walk up and pet the manticores mantle  matt okay  travis aw fuck that thing  khary id like to cast a spell  matt what would you like to cast  khary fog cloud  matt okay you watch as the central portion of the chamber begins to fill with a thick mist  somewhat obscuring your vision more than a few feet in 
none	 front of you  laura what was that  taliesin is this supposed to happen  sam whats going on  laura we should get out of here  khary i step behind nott and whisper in her ear i say that this was a bold move you made and we  wouldnt have made it we wouldnt have succeeded without you so i say you earned that gold but  make no mistake be careful where you put your fingers  sam yes fog monster  matt all right what else would you like to do  laura should 
none	 we get out of here i guess  travis yeah  laura anything else in the chamber does it look like theres any other little interesting things  in there  travis hey molly  taliesin yeah  matt honestly it looks like everything was clustered in the nest or on the priest  travis you want to help me butcher that manticore head  taliesin lets do this  travis yeah  matt easily enough within but a few moments between the tripleblades that the two of you  wield you manage to carve a fresh and carryable by 
none	 two of you this is now the second beast head  you guys have acquired carrying along with you a female manticore head  sam were not going to take those giant manacles are we  laura yeah  khary ill take the tail  travis yeah well be taking all of that  sam its huge can we carry that  matt all the manacles together probably weigh about 25 pounds so its carryable  travis just over the shoulder just walk out  matt you couldnt carry it  sam i cant carry it thats how much i 
none	 weigh  travis even i couldnt carry that  taliesin caleb come on  marisha hey you all right  taliesin later  liam yeah  taliesin theres time for that later  liam yeah  taliesin come on lets go get some sunlight  marisha i grab caleb wrap an arm around him and try to walk him out  taliesin im going to grab the other side were going to yep  taliesin you did good  laura well im still here with this big giant manticore head so you guys got caleb  travis im helping out 
none	  khary youre going through a change my friend and thats not a bad thing  laughter  matt all right you guys manage to exit the mines it seems that the remainder of the gnoll  warband have either scattered or collapsed beneath the earlier tunnel falling  khary gnoll cowards  marisha cowardly gnolls cowardly gnolls  liam you just cured me  matt you bring yourself back to the surface the light of the day is growing closer to sunset  another hour hour and a half or so before the sun sets but you return to 
town	 the shack which has been  untouched unsullied since your leaving the remainder of the survivors greet you upon you  letting them know youve returned and you watch two more reunions occur as the two individuals you  had saved from the belly of the manticore find the rest of their family within the survivors you  gather the rest of the bodies and whoever needs the travel and begin to load up the cart you  brought with you as well as the manticore head unless you want to carry that back to town yourself  laura i 
none	 think it might be easier to put it on the cart  matt you can rope it onto the cart without much of an issue though you still have a single horse  pulling a lot of people and a lot of manticore head that horse is not going to be traveling at  maximum speed its going to be a slow pace on that thing  laura i mean if its all slow then it doesnt matter i can walk alongside it and pull the  manticore head  matt eventually after night falls you can make camp or 
town	 you continue to make your way to alfield  its only a few miles off and youll probably get there maybe an hour or two after sunset  taliesin sure  laura we should probably just get there  taliesin lets make it all the way back  matt all right as you guys make your way under the outskirts of town back through the forest  that cradles the northeast side of the city a handful of crownsguard that are keeping watch for  any sort of incursion watch you approach and immediately one of them puts up a 
town	 hand halt who  goes there  taliesin all hail the conquering heroes  laura the saviors of alfield have returned  taliesin huzzah  matt right the um yes come this way he seems to not be able to deal with the fact that  youve arrived with all of these survivors and the head of a manticore being pulled by this poor horse  sam its two horses  travis there are two horses  sam wc and crapper  matt making your way into the town since youve seen it last a number of buildings still lay 
town	  in cinders ash and burned structures but the people are in the process of cleaning and  rebuilding their lives from the night before where this first attack initially happened within a  short time the crownsguard seemed to have brought bryce back for you bryce which you have not met  yet is currently the watchmaster of the town you see a genderfluid halfelf with blonde  shoulderlength hair and armor they seem to be recovering from the wound they sustained the night  before and as you approach they immediately come up to you with a bit 
none	 of a jog and say my gods  youve certainly come through on my what is that  laura its a manticore head  taliesin there was a lot  matt apparently they scratch their head and shake their head in wonderment well youve  laughs thank you what do we call you  marisha oh shit  laura oh fuck  sam well get back to you  travis yeah  laura were still a  taliesin this is all very new  travis were the tbds  matt very well the woman by the way who you had 
none	 helped earlier she comes forward with two of  the members and they come forward to the watchmaster and they say bryce watchmaster all  of these people came and helped my baby and and turns and looks at you and is looking about to  introduce you if you have a moment you wish to halt or intercede  khary i stop i hold my hand up i put my finger over my lips shh  matt anyway thank you all other folks are starting to come out of their respective homes now  to see this spectacle children 
none	 are gawking and you hear gasps at the sight of the horrible beast  head the tongue lolling out and dragging across the ground  other people are gathering and having reunions other people are beginning to identify  the dead that have been brought in the cart and while there is sadness and crying there is also  closure there are even some still that are disappointed to not see those they had hoped to  see amongst those who had been recovered given that still a heros night is to be prepared and  people begin to prepare 
town	 food for a brief moment past the darkness you can hear music begin to  build as people begin to bring chairs and tables out to the center of the town square the  intersection of where alfields simple backwoods lifestyle seems to still understand what  celebration is in the face of victory as what better case is there to be but to celebrate those  who stood up to such evils as you all think over what youve done this ragtag group of wandering  knownothings that have managed to come together and do a good thing for 
none	 some coin maybe but a  good thing nonetheless  laura i pull out the jar of ears  laughter  laura before i hand them over i open the lid and i whisper in thadeus candleglow says hello i  shut it i think i did what he asked  sam he said to do that he said to say that to the people  laura they heard it  liam also caleb has been very distant for the last couple of hours but absentmindedly scoops up  notts hand doesnt look at nott but holds notts hand  
none	 sam i stealthily take my bag of coin and slide it into his back pocket and i pat it and say i got  you some book money  khary shakäste is standing at a distance everyone else is walking towards the village the  duchess is perched on his shoulder and he scrawling something in the dirt with that long  reed its kind of an h and he fades into the forest  marisha we dont get to say goodbye  laura hes the coolest  marisha hes so cool  matt on that note were going to
