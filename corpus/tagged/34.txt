none	 matt hello everyone and welcome to tonights pseudo notreally episode of critical role where  a bunch of nerdy voice actors sit around here and tonight maybe play a little bit of dungeons   dragons my name is matthew mercer and unfortunately we have a number of members who  were sick after our convention appearances this last weekend who couldnt make the game tonight  due to unfortunate circumstances so with the amount of people who couldnt make it we decided  to instead not play this week and instead do a live qa with the questions in 
none	 the chat room and  as well as questions that were put on reddit so well get to those there in just a moment and  then when thats over as decided recently im going to have a fun battle royale i made a small  arena and the latter half of todays episode is going to be grog versus keyleth versus zahra  versus kashaw freeforall see who stands winning at the end of this show  will its going to be such a slaughter  mary im looking forward to the three minutes of gameplay  will exactly 
none	 its going to be 90 seconds of great fighting  matt i cannot wait  travis can anyone cast hold person or friends  will i can thats good to know okay see i wouldnt have known that just like turning undead the first  time  travis i shouldnt have said anything  mary why did you say anything  matt so that will be the second half of the show after we take our midway break before that  happens lets do a quick round of announcements first and foremost i wanted to say thank you to  
none	 our critters and fans that came out to wizard world portland this past weekend we had an  incredible turnout wizard world was very happy and were looking to possibly be doing more of  those in the near future so well be able to see other parts of the us meet more of you guys we  didnt have the chance to that weekend its wonderful to meet all of you both at the con and  at guardian games out there it was a great game store we got to hang out with a bunch of you in 
none	  person but thank you so much for coming out and visiting we really appreciate it also today i  put up on the dungeons masters guild site dmsguildcom a new order for the blood hunter  class its called order of the lycan which i mentioned a little bit at wizard world but its  essentially a blood hunter order that involves as part of a ritual called the taming they accept  the lycanthropic curse and through training and honing their willpower and the blood magic that is  part of blood hunters training they can control the 
none	 curse of lycanthropy to a certain extent to  prevent themselves from going berserk but still reap the benefits as they transform into whatever  werecreature they choose  travis werecreature  matt i mean theres weretigers wererat so you decide which strain youre infected with  will a wererat would be pretty damn cool  travis can you change or are you locked into one  matt no youre locked to the strain of lycanthropy you are unless you get uncursed and  you get another strain  marisha like half rat half person  travis like a big 
none	 ass rat or youre like little bitty  matt no youre like big ass nasty  travis princess bride  matt warhammer skaven style its pretty rad yeah bigger than that  will i dont think they exist  matt but yeah its on the dms guild site its free go check it out see if its something you  guys want check it out its good also another announcement i want to make real fast im saying  this because ive gotten 15 to 20 tweets a day about it for the earthbreaker groon fight last  week it 
none	 was intentional that the quivering palm ability was held back he was testing individuals  in the battle not trying to go lethal or kill it was more of a tease for the actual ability god  forbid they ever come across a not quite as helpful or restrained monk in the future but im  well aware it was intentional i shouldve made it more clear that he was holding back in the  moment and i apologize for the confusion it caused  travis hold on he was holding back during that whole thing  matt yeah  
none	 travis cool awesome  will somebody asked me about that too i think my response was what he keeps holding back and  its like all right i just want a good fight  travis put my belly button with my spine thats holding back  matt yeah  marisha i love how thats part of the announcements though you try to  matt im just trying to quell it now because its been perpetual and im like i know its all  good  will its a good fight  matt it was a good fight i love me 
none	 some monks man it was so great to bring a monk in there and  more hopefully to come because there are those in the world that are trained for different sets  marisha in fact maybe nows a good time to hearken back to your episode one announcement  because its been almost 50 since youve made the announcement that you like to house rule a lot of  stuff  matt yeah house rules rules are fluid you have a good time but dont worry about it i know that  you guys want to see it come 
none	 out in all its full glory and that may still happen in the future we  shall see  mary youll be a lycantiger monk or a lycanrat monk  will wow  mary can you cross  matt i mean you could multiclass  will it sounds like something we would have on thundercats  mary and marisha yeah  travis snarf gets an upgrade  will snarfgrade snarr  laughter  travis the quivering snarf  matt the quivering snarf  will the quivering snarf  matt thats a great romance novel descriptor as he lies there his 
none	 quivering snarf in the  moonlight all right so that i think is all my announcements you guys have anything else you  want to talk about before we jump into the qa  travis this cookies good  mary oh steve blum and i are going to be at coastcon next weekend not this weekend the next  weekend in biloxi so come on out and say hi  will nice march 17th i will be in toronto at the big con up there so thats going to be a lot  of fun so come out canada and

tavern	 cover as the internet likes to  perpetually point out  will can i say something because brandon sanderson is my favorite author bar none these  books are incredible theyre amazing you should read everything he does these are all from  mistborn they start with the mistborn trilogy they go from there these are standalone novels  that take place after everything you knew about vin and everybody else they are incredible so  these are a really cool prize  travis laura says the same thing and i think it was kit buss art of those novels 
none	 that we saw  first and were like oh shes an amazing artist  matt yeah thank you brandon sanderson for bringing us our main artist on critical role so  yeah well be giving these out throughout the show tonight  marisha along with those giveaways with lootcrate i did an espionage nailwrap tutorial  and jamie hooked me up and gave me a few critical hit nail wraps yeah you can go see how easy and  awesome it is actually someone asked me at the con this weekend if i was a paid sponsor like  paid 
none	 promoter for espionage and the answer is no ashley johnson and i actually legitimately  really love their products and are huge fans im just a legit fan i think i tweeted the link  yesterday im going to go tweet it out and go check out espionage cosmetics theyre great  matt do it  travis those go on your nails  marisha i have some on right now  matt they can you can certainly try  will is that what those are so thats not paint  marisha no thats not paint theyre these theyre nail wraps 
none	 and you stick them on theyre  like stickers and you put clear coat on them and they last two weeks  travis no they dont  will no i dont deserve it  mary you could demonstrate on will  marisha i could yeah i could you want to demonstrate i need a nail file  will youre going to need more than nail file some kind of a big thing  travis chainsaw sounds  marisha i demonstrate in the tutorial but theyre really great and actually do make some  for dudes as well they make some 
none	 that are like gender neutral  will okay im not a big nailguy but all right  matt im not either but ive worn before  travis its gender neutral is it really for dudes  matt its for everybody yeah marisha  travis come on  marisha yeah semantics all right  matt all right so that being the case the first half of this evening is going to be a general qa  guys were going to be poring through the reddit were going to be trying to keep up with  the chat room to answer what 
none	 questions we can so feel free if you see something come by the chat  room on the side there guys if you caught something that seems like a fun question to  answer feel free to jump out and take it if somebodys in the middle of explaining  travis are you serious that thing moves like the matrix screen  matt and mary i know  will i just like matthew youre dreamy  ryan were pasting a lot of questions that come up  matt great  travis oh theres an emoji thing  matt ryan will 
none	 be helping with this  marisha so good  matt there it goes  marisha hey wheres wendy we could bring wendy out  matt and mary yeah wheres wendy  ryan im going to go get her  matt were going to pull her real fast see if you guys say hi to wendy she is one of our  official critical role artists she did all the artwork for our fantastic story of vox machina  prestream video and for the show  marisha she also did all the art for the winters crest festival  will yay 
none	  mary shes wearing the best tshirt ever  cheering  travis and mary hi wendy  marisha were getting a chair for you here you go scooch up a little bit  matt ryan you want to start throwing questions out  ryan i have to frame her up and then i can do questions  matt perfect in the meantime ill start with some  marisha do it all at once damn it  matt some of the reddit questions we have ready to go pregosfearstaircases on reddit  all pregosfearstaircases  travis can we just talk about 
none	 how thats the best name ive heard all day thats amazing  mary better than bonertown  travis well bonertowns a classic  matt what does the pcs do for prep i notice dry erase markers for temporary hit points do they  lay out their spell cards or have them typed up on one page what do you guys do to prep for a game  travis well theres many hours of meditation and reflection that goes into what professor grog is  going to do next or you can tattoo impulse on my forehead that would probably be 
none	 it  marisha does it need to be that clear nothing yeah how do they mean  mary do you go through your spells and stuff  marisha clearly not  will you guys also know them so well by now that were learning so were there going like most  of my prep is calling you and saying what can i do at level four thats what i do because we  watch you guys and its like all right they know everything i didnt know any of this stuff  you know it better than i do  
none	 mary i feel like im cramming for an exam its a constant school nightmare of im not wearing  pants and i didnt study  will and theres a dragon in front of me and i dont know how to kill it  mary hellish something  matt the classic school argument  will exactly  marisha i guess i sometimes try and go back and watch the end of the last episode so i can remember  where we were  will like breaking bad  marisha yeah  will nice  marisha i also have all my spells 
none	 on little cards ive got a few spell references ive got  the book cards and spreadsheets i have dry erase markers and my notebooks endless notebooks ive  become the token party notetaker of the group  travis youre very organized  matt and every now and then we still get a wind walk as much as we prep we still sometimes dont  get it right  mary the question was for the playable characters but how much time do you put in  matt per week i put at least as much time in prep as we 
none	 do playing so from like three four  hours plus a week into prepping for each one of our games that involves not just prepping for  that session but also writing ahead planning for future elements that might tie into events seeing  how things that happened last session will affect ripple down the line and trying to make sure that  im not completely caught offguard not that it ever helps im always completely caught  offguard but it makes me feel better and sleep at night during the week  travis its kind of great because we 
none	 have this endless resource of people who are going to let  you know when you miss or forget something so its like whats the point of prepping because an  hour after the show i have 500 people going you might have forgotten about that yep never even  thought about it  matt its like having a wave of clippy the paperclip um  marisha uh by the way  matt it looks to me like youre trying to use reckless attacks  will did you mean quivering palm  travis to be clear i like that it 
none	 is there so please keep it coming otherwise i might not  remember any of that stuff  marisha see i have a bunch of people shouting spells at me that i should do that i may or may  not have learned because druids work do druids work like clerics where we learn spells at the top  of the day do clerics work like that  matt yeah same way where you choose the ones you have memorized prepared and then you can choose  from that list  travis how many do you get  marisha like 
none	 17  travis 17 spells  mary but you can only choose between how many per day  marisha well i can choose 17 that i have total and then i have four 1stlevel spell slots three  2ndlevel three 3rdlevel three 4thlevel two 5thlevel one 6thlevel and one 7thlevel that i  can use so theoretically i could learn ten level four spells but i only have three slots  that i can use of those ten so i have 17 spells that i can learn that i can pull from my entire  list which is like 100 
none	 spells but i have to balance it out so i have four 1stlevel spell  slots that i can burn so i try to pick three to four first level spells that i learn at the top of  the day so when people are shouting at me over the internet going keyleth polymorph trinket  polymorph him i dont necessarily have it learned i have to learn every time at the top of  the day  travis you also dont hear them  will i did because i had wil wheaton going turn undead why arent you turning 
none	 undead  because i dont fucking know what that means what are you talking about thats what i had that was  my prep you have the whole internet i had him yelling at me  matt now thats my high school nightmare wil wheaton in my ear the whole time  mary stop rolling ones oh  travis yeah  mary sorry wil i love you  matt all right so see if we can find another question coming up here  marisha i saw someone ask if wendy was going to play with us  wendy that is 
none	 up to you guys  laughter  matt good to know its an interesting balance for the show because for critical role its the  story of vox machina im trying to not turn it into a guestoftheweek show this is why im  very sparing with storylines and bringing guests in you guys i brought in for the slayers take  and this was the right time to bring you guys back for a bit well have a couple more guests coming  in next month it looks like but i dont want to make it too constant we 
none	 may have you in as a  guest in the future it may not be very soon but its good to know that youre interested  wendy i would be honored  matt okay yeah we will have guests occasionally occasionally because this is the  story of the core party  travis yeah  will it should be its the way it should be  matt we could do a spinoff with guests only or something i dont know  will were already talking about it you guys have thursday nights well preyou well do  wednesday night and 
dung	 well have our own show itll be fine just the two of us going i dont know  mary i dont know i burned my three spells can we wait an hour i need a short rest  will and wils voiceover going turn undead  matt theres no dungeon master  will theres no dungeon master at all  mary thats all i remember hellish rebuke what a day im out  matt that would be amazing  mary were going to get a home game  will we have other friends that really want to play so were 
town	 going to start playing probably  getting a game together a week and its some interesting people that want to join us  mary if we can get one of them to get in town for longer than a day  will weve got some cool people that want to join our little club so you guys have definitely  inspired us which is good  mary so much so that liam has said can we come and watch  will thats going to be fun  matt lets see this is an interesting question from raquem on reddit do 
none	 you or anyone ever get  tired of this being broadcast and wish you could go back to your more personal game while a lot of  good has come out of critical role in terms of exposure do you find the invasive nature of the  internet to be difficult to handle would you have a problem saying okay were done now thanks  geek and sundry thanks everyone and see you later  that was our fear when we first started the show and it was a very real fear because taking  something thats so personal to 
none	 us and putting it on the internet is one a risk two a danger  having the internet come out and set fire to it and tell you that your fun is wrong  will your fun is wrong i want that shirt  laughter  matt i dont speak for everyone here but while that was our fear in practice im pleasantly  surprised that was never the case the community thats sprung out of this is so supportive and so  positive even the exceptions are people that are passionate enough to want a voice and to feel 
none	  involved theres not the hate that we were expecting from it and it hasnt really changed  how we play the game or our experience with it we enjoy it just the same it may not be as close  physically and the map proximity to the players is something were still working on getting  better but other than that  will thats a question i would have then you guys play dungeons and dragons and its a ton of  fun and everybodys having a great time but at your core youre all entertainers were all  
none	 entertainers thats what we do how much of any of it has changed because now theres an audience  everything changes when theres an audience theres an audience and youre entertainers  thats what you do  mary or do you forget about it at this point forget that the cameras are there and you  matt thats more the case if there was a live audience its hard not to and as a stage  performer you draw energy from the audience and its a mutual sharing  will you do for the cameras too though you might forget 
none	 that the cameras are there but you  always forget that the cameras are there while knowing exactly where the cameras are thats how  we are as performers the cameras are gone but you know exactly where you have to look ive  totally forgotten that the cameras there but i know its right there  matt its become a layer of it i wouldnt say its impeded or changed our experience at least  not for me  marisha we seem to become more committed maybe we try not to dick around in between at home  wed 
none	 go hang on ive got to go can we take 45 minutes for a break  travis did we i think those were some pretty marathon sixhour sessions we would break off for  whispers  matt but there would be catching up on shit you did during the week  travis we were pretty slapdickish when we were playing and i think weve carried that through  pretty nicely  matt this is true  marisha i think we were pretty selfish in wanting to entertain ourselves  travis thats true its weird because sams such a great improv 
none	 person liams got crazy  theater experience so everybody knows to honor moments when to be quiet when not to the timing  is such a great thing among the cast were all friends so theres no trying to figure each other out  marisha i feel like all that was there before the show that was all there  matt its a lot of luck that we had those relationships beforehand and making that momentum  in the game before we put it on camera what things may have changed have been so minimal by  comparison that i 
dung	 havent noticed too much of a difference personally  will i was saying it would be a cool experiment to have you dungeon master a game with a group of  people that have never played before  matt ive done it on camera  will that would be really interesting its like being on any other cast where after a while you  know what your fellow cast members going to do in a certain way you know whats going to happen  itd be interesting where its six people who have never met before go  travis that 
dung	 was like that d  diesel thing because he had played years ago but chobot and  dan were new to it and when you sit down and youre happygolucky about it and you drop into  your dungeon master thing people are like oh shit this is real  laughter  travis its the perfect tonesetter  matt that will be one of my shining moments of my entire career was looking over at vin fucking  diesel this burly fast and furious guy  travis tiny arms  laughter  travis he sat down it was like thuds 
none	  laughter  matt i shook his hand when he got there i was like hi  marisha i still remember the camera guys were like all right diesel sit in frame he was  like thud and the camera guys like let me just scoot the camera back a little bit adjust  the focus  matt that was the defining moment watching that arrive he was so nice and so cordial and so much  fun and open to it and then he sat down and as soon as we started looking over and seeing this  burly 
none	 man turn into an eightyearold  mary completely and you could see it on camera it was amazing and then to see him slowly and  eventually come out of that shell and gain confidence and remember what it was like to play  this at his age now  travis those criticals didnt hurt either  mary no it was so awesome  matt his luck was ridiculous we only had 25 minutes to play that game which they cut down  from an hour when we got there i was like okay i was so afraid he would 
none	 roll shitty and  have a terrible time but he rolled really well and i was like yes thank you  travis thank you rng jesus  will i also have to say i dont know if you actually saw the movie it was fun  travis yes  will it was fun it really was i watched it two nights ago i had fun  travis first five or ten minutes i was like this is going to be a great movie  laughter  will they made a movie just for me  matt travis do you and 
none	 laura even break into character at home during stressful situations to  lighten the mood  travis shit no laura is already rolling her eyes enough at grog that if i tried to be that  stupid at home shed be like fucking stop she wouldnt let that fly we talk to each other in  weird voices almost never our own but if i tried to talk as grog i would get dragon eyes of death  id get smarter real fast  will i would like to slap you roll a dexterity saving throw  mary feel better 
none	 laura  matt hope you feel better ryan do we have any burning questions in the chat room  ryan i have eight pages  matt do you want to toss one out toss one out there we can maybe tackle  ryan i can also just give you the damn thing  matt also viable but i like hearing your voice  travis lob it softball that bad boy  ryan red sea logos does the positive outweigh the negative on the internet does it make it  worth it because we love you guys im assuming theyre referring 
none	 to comments from people and the  community that have been developed does the positive outweigh the negative  matt far far far far the negative is so comparatively miniscule in comparison to that  positive energy that you guys continuously generate not just around the show but this  entire twitch channel and everyone that works hard on it its been overwhelming that was my biggest  fear that the internet was going to come in and go no and stab me in the chest dont do that  please no ive already answered the question from my perspective 
none	 its been so overwhelmingly  positive  travis its really such a weird thing to be positive all the way across and if youre not we  mute you  will i still want the your fun is wrong shirt your fun is wrong  marisha even the people who get heated or upset theyre getting heated and upset at our imaginary  characters that we made up in our heads so at the end of the day its still working were still  affecting them  matt you guys are so invested in the play time to have this 
none	 much passion to yell about  marisha it makes them feel that  mary think about the effect that its had creatively on people lets talk to wendy about  that come on the artwork has been and the fanfiction  will there was some fanfic this morning i was like what wait a minute hes doing what why  is he naked  mary what am i doing with my tail  will seriously shes using her tail  mary whos driving okay but in terms of artwork its unbelievable  wendy and your characters come to life so 
none	 well and the world that youve painted is so vivid so  its easy to doodle it out  travis its so great  mary wendy doodles  matt its not just artwork too theres people that have produced incredible musical tracks many  of which ive actually incorporated in our ingame soundtracks people that have sent fanfiction and  have gotten into writing heavily some of them because of the show people tell us i havent  written in 15 years and after watching the show im working on a new novel its much bigger than  us at 
none	 this point  will thats cool though thats what you want thats when everybodys imagination takes over  and it goes to a whole other level the same thing happens with fantasy baseball its that kind of  thing it started with a bunch of people around the table then everybody takes it and do whatever  they want  matt its music its doing what you love and inspiring other people to do what they love and  there are many people that inspired me to do this and things before this and its great to continue  that 
none	 chain to do honor to those that inspire me to continue to do the things that i love and  hopefully continue that chain  marisha beyond that  travis no sorry i had an art question  marisha i know you guys you were saying you talk with kit and meg all the time and we were having  the conversation not long ago all of our official artists thus far ones in los angeles ones in  the uk in london one is in wheres joma  mary the philippines  marisha the philippines the others in the 
none	 philippines  mary and viktor is in  marisha hes in sweden all of our official artists have been on different continents which  is crazy  matt mikandis in the middle east  marisha yeah mikandis in the middle east thats right  matt we have people all over the world its incredible and people creating their own  adventures and sending us pictures and stories from their own home games and art of their  characters its so cool  mary anything that spawns that kind of creativity is amazing  wendy creativity spawning creativity sorry  travis 
none	 if you come up with a sketch do you ever stop and start and stop and start or is it what  hits the page is eventually what comes up we see so much art and rarely do we ever go no thats  not how i saw it were like yes also yes  wendy i know sometimes ill be watching and sometimes i sit there and wait for a really cool  moment to come up and then bam there it is ive got to get that down my job is to put what  happens visually so 
none	 it just comes to me i guess sometimes it doesnt work ill sketch something  out and it doesnt look right so ill have to do it again but what i put up yeah  travis its so cool its like a crystal ball  will one of the things you guys have also done in a weird way is youve given people permission  to do this if that makes any sense ive talked to certain people who have been like yeah ive  played dd forever but we dont really talk about it literally people are like we 
none	 dont bring  it up we dont talk about it its our thing theres six or seven of us nobody really tells  their friends about it we just do our thing and now we watch that show and we talk about it its  permission to go yeah we nerd out its the greatest thing in the world and its so much  fun i think a lot of it is you guys doing that where its a show  mary its improv i never knew what it was the first time i played was here and i was 
none	 like oh  my gosh i studied this in grad school and college its improv  will with wizards  mary with wizards  will it cant get better than that  mary can i do it sure roll okay so then theres gambling  laughter  mary yelling at my dice its craps and improv and amazingness  matt it feels like i mentioned this at portland it feels like being part of fight club  i was going through tsa when we were coming back from portland oregon im going through tsa and  the guy comes out 
none	 with the laptop because it gets picked up from the side and the guy has the  gloves on and he pulls it off and looks at it and hands it back to me and goes here you go also  had to stop your buddy scanlan earlier i was like what and i go back and sam who had  already gone through tells me that yeah he had some of his checked and the guy hands it to him  and goes your bag scanlan shorthalt  laughter  matt people all throughout the world that sit down 
none	 and watch the show and they keep it all  secret and put little comments off to the side and its incredible  marisha and two days later the hollywood pantages tweeted scanlan just walked the red  carpet  matt yeah the hollywood pantages  marisha the pantages whoever runs social for pantages watches critical role  matt so hi if its you i had a bartender at the echoplex when we were there for booty la one  night and i went to order some drinks and he goes sure do you play dungeons  dragons on the 
none	  internet  marisha which is very jarring when youre drenched in sweat and youre like untz untz  untz someones like dd and youre like  matt it was awesome  marisha i feel really sober now  will thats cool  matt next question are there any youve chosen there  marisha someone asked would you recommend playing a game with friends or finding a group  made up of strangers  matt you can go either way i would recommend if you havent played before and have any level of  selfconsciousness about it try and find 
none	 friends and people youre comfortable with to try it out  for the first time if you dont find that much of a social problem with engaging new things with  people you dont know you can definitely give it a shot and if it turns out not being your thing  if its at a premade game with strangers then you can go back and try and find friends to play and  if your friends are like i dont know how dd works send them an episode of critical role  travis yeah theres a guy we know 
none	 that plays at emerald knights and i forget what night they have  dd nights  matt wednesday nights  travis wednesday nights he showed up a couple of times to play with one group and then he hopped  in some rando group and was totally nervous about it but he was like it was the best game ive  ever played because nobody knew him or what he was going to do so he was free to make these wild  choices and be totally nuts he was like it was exhilarating im like dd night was  
none	 exhilarating he was like yeah man it was great  will theres a place right near us that does stuff like that fire  dice right near us  travis were coming  laughter  travis hello are you open  matt thats a good question someone asked how did you guys decide on the name critical role for the show  i think that was actually a liam suggestion wasnt it you and liam were doing a few on that  one  marisha we had a text thread going we had a few different options that we were 
none	 floating around  mary what were the other ones  travis d20 turds  will prego fear staircases  laughter  matt nothing but doors doors forever i cant remember some of the ones we had but critical  role was the one that seemed to best encompass who we are where we come from and it plays in with  the rpg theme but also roleplay and us being actors who play roles for a living it put  everything together what we were so that one stood out  marisha i think charisma save was being tossed around 
none	 but someone else already had that  matt theres a lot of rpgbased names that already exist strangely  marisha we were trying to do something around dice box or dice tube or something  laughter  will we did andrew dice play for a while that wasnt working  travis everybody gets a pop and do the glasses  marisha we had a few different ones i have an art question so while wendy is here from  carbacca hey matt and the gang what scenes do you think you could describe or even act out  thats not 
none	 going to happen from before the stream that you would like to see drawn by us  crazy fan artists because there would be no new mewments no new moments this week  mary no nude movements  marisha no nude movements  matt no twitter has proven that wrong  marisha artists need something to draw  travis prestream  matt and marisha prestream  travis i have one so one of the first pranks that vax pulled on grog was we were sleeping  around a campfire and in the middle of the night vax went over and 
none	 wrote dork on grogs forehead  with a piece of charcoal from the campfire and when i woke up we mightve been drinking while  we were playing when we woke up i look in my goblet ingame and i see the reflection and i  said who wrote kord on my face krod  laughter  travis in character cant even spell it backwards  matt its so good  travis it was one of the first ones and off went the prank war  matt there was that and i remember named after that you guys purchased an 
none	 ox at one of the small  towns on your way out to emon it was near westruun you purchased an ox that was useless  and you named it dork the ox  travis we were going to use him as a sacrifice  will dork the ox  marisha and we tried to interrogate him because we were hoping he would know stuff  matt speak to animals the ox was just like  marisha he was like im a cow i dont know shit  matt it was similar to you interrogating the cows in the later 
town	 episode you learned so much from the  first time as you started to travel because dork doesnt travel very well grog took it upon  himself to find a way to cram him into the bag of holding which took a series of strength checks  and tensile checks to see that the bag didnt burst in the process  travis its like in hermiones handbag  matt he wasnt a huge ox but he was still growing up managed to push him in there and this  was also the sad lesson when they reached the next town 
none	 to realize that the bag of holding does not  have a perpetual air supply and that was the end of dork the ox  travis dork was toast we pull him out this giant carcass fell out  will poke holes in the bag for dork  mary at least you ate well that night  travis i was like oh shit and we butchered him and we put him back in little pieces but  then we also learned that the bag of holding is not refrigerated so three months later i pull it  out and this 
none	 gelatinous ooze comes sliding out were like has it coated everything else in  there  lets say no  matt oh man what are some other great moments from prestream  marisha two years worth  matt the most serious one was pikes death  mary thats what i was going to say  matt pike being killed in the throne room i think your artwork in the prestream video  wonderfully done with the shadow against the wall  travis we were not expecting that  matt yeah that was the glabrezu the treachery demon getting the killing 
none	 blow on pike as the  whole party watched on and crumpled to their knees  travis yeah ashley literally pulled her shirt up to her eyes and laura sat under the table  marisha yeah in the fetal position  travis they were both crying and the rest of us were in shock what we do what what happened  marisha it was really sad we always remember the time we discovered the magic carpet too because  that was so good it was so epic alluras tower which weve seen now happen on game right her  tower 
none	 implode  matt well alluras tower has a specific magical defense where it can crush itself into a small  extradimensional space and then rebuild itself however the recent attack on the tower was not  part of the defense mechanism that was vorugal actually destroying the tower so what you saw  recently in emon was the end of alluras tower which is unfortunate  great question here and this pertains to you and technically you romance between player  characters is not something you see in a lot of games this is by gore ax on reddit liam 
none	 said in  an interview that he approached you first about the possibility of adding romance to the game  what advice did you give to him or would you give to dms and players about that subject also since  you knew about vaxs interest in keyleth months before marisha did that ever create an awkward  moment that you had to play dumb about it  interesting question i think romance in game is an interesting storytelling facet i think its  been a phenomenal thread in our game and its driven a lot of great character moments 
none	 and its  brought some needed realism to both vax and keyleths relationship its been really cool  you do have to be respectful and you have to make sure that the game group is mature enough to  handle that that would involve one talking with the players and the dm before it happens in this  situation liam talked to me without talking to marisha because he wasnt sure if he wanted to  pursue it or not he just wanted to make sure it wouldnt be weird for me and as were actors and  we trust 
none	 we understand the separation between character and ourselves that was never an issue  i was very comfortable with liam  but not all games will be like that and some people might have jealousy issues so you want to  make sure before you even pursue anything like that that you talk to everyone involved and make  sure that its cool its not necessary and it can be a really cool facet if everybody treats it  like that  and romance doesnt have to be a very melodramatic thing either it could be an element of the 
none	  flavor it could be a flirtation you carry on and is an offcamera thing that gets mentioned here  and there it doesnt have to be that you sit there at the precipice of a cliff declaring your  love for 30 minutes while the other players gag themselves in the corner  will you could just kiss her and leave thats what i did kiss her and walk out the door  marisha cowboy in the sunset  will by the way i probably shouldve asked you about that do you mind if i kiss her and then 
none	  leave  matt no it was a great moment i knew you were leaving  laughter  will exactly i knew you were out  matt its cool too because some romances succeed and become a cool driving moment for the  character to try and protect the one they care about many romances fail and end up leading to an  interesting tension between the characters im excited to see where this goes because it could  go either way theres been a lot of interesting perspectives here what i like about your guys  romance is its 
none	 very realistic in the sense that it isnt an immediate grasping each other and  its perfect both of you are broken people and youre both trying to still figure out whatever  this is and keyleths very unsure and youre both feeling out the circumstance in the midst of  this apocalyptic chaos i find it fascinating  will and then kash comes back in the middle to add a little thats how life works its  absolutely how life works though  marisha because you know kash was keyleths first kiss right  will yeah its one of 
none	 those things  mary and it doesnt have to be this bang bong thing the most beautiful moment i think was  when he knocked on your door and said i dont want to be alone tonight and one of my favorite  pieces of art came out of that of you are my sun that was so beautiful and encapsulated that  moment so perfectly without having it hot and heavy or anything else just two lonely broken  people seeking solace  matt everyones like oh are they going to go and bang im like no not where 
tavern	 they are as  people theyre both so hurt and feeling so sad and alone that they need that comfort of somebody  else there to hold them that artwork i felt was a great encapsulation of that  will thats the thing that amazed me about watching you guys and how into your characters you  guys got the last episode we did when were all in the bar and theyre having a drink we finish  the episode and liam went man we needed that and it was like with everything going on we  needed to sit 
tavern	 at a bar and we needed to drink we needed that you could tell everybody gets into  whats going on its really cool  mary and then we watched scanlan cause diarrhea  will and the snarfed quivering palm technique  laughter  matt i like that if you guys see any questions by the way that you want to reach out and grab  feel free to or we could look through some of these papers  ryan theres a question for wendy that someone sent by toruya what class would she play if she  were to 
none	 join  wendy well in a game that im playing already i play a druid and her name is clover  marisha clovers so cute  wendy shes a faun thats what i would play  matt thats awesome clovers awesome  marisha travis what is yours andor grogs favorite kill that youve had  travis grog voice theyre like your children you cant really pick one  laughter  will its going to be kashaw in about an hour  travis i think the one where he bit the tongue out of the mouth and then tore it out 
none	 that was  pretty good the gorier the better  matt you bask in the glory of those so well  travis i do i get so happy when its a blood shower  matt this question here matt does anyone in the game have a deck of many things no and if i can  help it they never will  will write down where we can find that  mary deck of many things  matt oh good luck guys deck of many things is what you throw in the game when youre bored and  want to 
none	 get it over with  travis that was the charity game right  matt yeah  marisha i have someone here saying how detailed are our notes she just says how detailed are  your notes i dont know if shes asking matt or us why dont you go first  matt my preparation is pretty a lot of my notes are narrative points and bullet points ill  choose whatever locations they might possibly go to ill list what npcs are there and what their  current circumstance is i will then bulletpoint important bits of information that npc 
none	 might know  based on certain topics that are relevant to the current storyline and have that there for quick  reference a lot of its shorthand to remind me a lot of it looks like a brokendown report that  you would send to some company somewhere its a structure of information for myself its very  loose because i dont want to feel like im reading a page too often there are certain scenes  i want to set properly and ill write those in advance and go back and forth but for the most  part ill 
none	 outline basic notes and points the npcs would know and then based on what you guys do  will do you ever do specific dialogue like i have to put this line in  matt every now and then if its a very key character moment and the story lends itself and  theres a good possibility that someone will ask about it theres many things that dont get asked  that the npcs never mention maybe thatll come to light down the line for more important npcs or  very specific story beats i will write out lines of 
none	 dialogue to make sure that i dont miss any  important information and to make sure that i dont end up leading the players astray  accidentally because when youre improvising off the cuff sometimes stuff comes out and youre  like oh shit whatd i just say  mary accents and everything else i was just thinking the notes you have to keep for making  sure you get the right voice  matt thats the other thing too whenever i create an npc ill note a texture and timbre of  their voice ill put gravelly lowkey haughty 
none	 and full of himself cornwall make note of the  texture and dialect i use if any that way i can get something ballpark of what they were before  its not going to be perfect and im sure if you line them up youd be like oh its changed  over time  travis what did you write next to victor crazy  will mad hatter  matt victor i didnt have to victor was created on the spot  wendy really  matt yeah and since then i had to write down fucking crazy old guy prospector i 
none	 think is  where it came from very much that victor voice crazy old prospector type thing that realm  mary i was going to try to mask of many faces of vanessa and i turned to travis and was like  what accent did vanessa have i totally forgot i cant sell it if i dont have the accent  travis i was like spanish  matt shes eastern european  ryan this question has come up several times so i figure it should be asked its by villager26  valkyr parable and gaica has there been a storyline 
none	 that hasnt been or cannot be explored  now that the campaigns on stream if so can you tell us about it also was there a failed version  of the campaign before vox machina with the same group like you guys tried it you had different  characters that didnt work and you had to reboot it  marisha tpkd  matt no actually this group vox machina was its first time coming together in this world i  created its been created over time with the campaign i didnt go out to build the setting to  build 
town	 the whole world it was a oneshot and i built a town i built stillben then as we turned  from a oneshot into a campaign i began expanding and now its become much bigger than i  anticipated and im perpetually fleshing it out over time but yeah there was no failed earlier  attempt per se  mary didnt taliesin have a different character and he rerolled  travis very first game right  matt very first game he had a character and he couldnt make it for the next few games it was a  dragonborn paladin 
none	 and then he couldnt make the next few games and when he was able to his  schedule opened up for the next one i was like do you want to play the same character he was  like i want to try something different and then percy was born that was where you guys found  him over in the umber hills  travis which is great because when he was playing that dragonborn wizard sorcerer  matt paladin  travis paladin he knew everything he saved us from dying in that first hour and a half we were 
none	  fumbling around like a bunch of blind morons and you could see him biding his time i wish we had  video of it so i could go back and see if you gave him a nod like go ahead and save these  jackasses he was like i would like to freeze this gear and move this and shift that and  everything stopped and were like were alive just because of taliesin  matt yeah i will say there arent any dead story threads from prestream its hard to equate  what that would be the party 
none	 went where they went there are many different facets of the world  that they didnt come across  marisha its like trying to argue past timelines that never existed  matt im sure there are things that might answer your question that i cant recall  marisha im sure i have a bunch of unborn children that will never happen  matt that got weird  marisha i dont know why i said it  will i just kissed her dude  mary thats a powerful kiss man  will just grab my medal hey thats what all the 
none	 slices on the arm are no  matt this is an interesting question from sanderf90 on reddit which npc that vox machina  encountered became a lot more important than you first expected we know clarota wasnt supposed to  join the party and victor came out of thin air are there any examples where a character you  didnt expect became far more important gilmore  mary gilmore yeah  matt your gilmore was phenomenal ryans gilmore was awesome he was a merchant in emon that i had  created that had a fun personality and i fleshed out 
none	 his background a little bit and i thought it  would be a fun character that they would occasionally come across but after that first  encounter it turned into a full discussion he and vax began to build this relationship and you  guys kept going back to him as your goto purveyor of magical goods in emon then the investment  became more attached and then as it progressed he became a central npc which im really happy  about i love gilmore hes such a great character  mary i cant wait to see where he goes 
none	 to be honest im really looking forward to seeing it  im as big a fan as you guys are of the show and its not just because you guys are my friends im  invested in these characters its such great compelling storytelling it really is bravo to  all of you guys plus its really fun but you also get invested in these great characters it  was hard last week to not hear about certain characters and go oh my oh i dont know  them  laughter  marisha going off that maelyn in the chat 
none	 asked if there was any more background for gilmore  matt yeah theres plenty of background for gilmore since he became a central character ive  fully fleshed out his backstory well have to see if it comes to light  marisha and going off that again stormshadow17 in chat asked are we more attached to these  characters because we made them from scratch and they didnt come from a script  matt and marisha very  travis yeah totally  matt there is something to be said about as actors youre handed roles and you work as a 
none	  collaboration with a production team to tell a story and all of you craft it together youre a  facet of the machine theres something about creating from scratch a characters personality  strengths weaknesses and then stepping into their shoes and developing them and seeing  whatever their potential is for good or evil and seeing it through in that imaginationbased body  of theirs that is so much more personal and connected that any role ive played a lot of npcs  in this game are closer to me than any character ive played in a video 
none	 game  will i also think you get the benefit of time here which you dont with a lot of roles you  play a lot of roles we do its like oh when did you play that role it was two tuesdays ago  for three hours thats when i played that role whereas this youre building it out and you  become your character its the difference of when you start a show theyre writing for you and  when you really get to know the character then theyre writing to you you know what i mean so 
none	  you guys have that awesome benefit of time so you really become your characters we have recording  sessions and even longrunning shows you might record once a week for three hours for four  months and thats it and then youre on to the next character  mary yeah but somebody else is making your choices for you in this you make your own  choices you make your own mistakes youve got your own success and everything else so it is  from you guys and what the character is learning  will when you came to 
none	 me and were like would you like to come on the show it was like yeah  great and youre like all right who do you want to be what here you go who do you want  to be lets build it you sat at my house id assumed matts going to come over for a  halfhour  marisha well my prom in eighth grade  travis its all therapeutic  will i thought he was coming over for a halfhour we were working for five hours all  right roll dude this is the greatest it was 
none	 awesome  matt which plays into a great question someone else asked in the chat room i cant remember who  it was unfortunately but they asked for will and mary how did you guys come up with your  character backstories  mary oh im obsessed with the moon and astral geography and everything else so i knew i wanted  that to have a very important part in her story and then to be honest i had never played dungeons   dragons so i looked at the group and i was like what does everybody have weve 
none	 got a  sorcerer weve got a druid weve got gnomes weve got bards i went on the internet and was  like whats oh a tiefling oh a warlock that still is a spellcaster i knew i wanted to cast  spells and i thought a tiefling thats not on the show lets do that its really cool looked  at the design and everything else and then make it as tragic as possible because thats always  good everybodys got a terrible childhood and we do but i love the image of her first time being  outside 
none	 was at night after this castle and looking up at the moon and having it sing to her  and save her life thats the moment when she came to life the first time ever is that moment and  then she throws rocks at it no im kidding  will yeah i dont know the name kashaw was one of the main characters in a story i wrote when i  was 16 he was the bad guy he was the bad brother so originally i was sitting there going  i guess kashaw could work and then it 
none	 changed the whole character then you and i sat down and  talked and once you and i talked for a while as a writer i then went here we go weve talked  about this since lauras the same way i love fantasy so much that once you get one little  nugget of an idea then you start building a world and the story goes from there and what  happens if we go this way or that way and then its the little things differentcolored eyes  having a whole story and the scars all have a 
none	 story and you can build from every little thing  you do  travis its like the ultimate character customization screen at the beginning of a video  game its unlimited  will side quick thing you guys do a lot of video games isnt it the greatest when youre the  voice of the you character so you can make it look like you and its your voice its the  coolest thing ever im the only one in the world that can do this  laughter  matt its really cool until your character dies a horrible death 
none	 and youre like im going to  take a walk  will its so funny i love that though  travis your own death  matt on the topic of backstories and tragic backstories i will say there is no more  dangerous occupation in any fantasy world than being a parent because everyones an orphan  laughter  matt if you have a kid youre counting your days down until a demon or orc comes and kills you and  burns your village  will yeah i guess its rare i created this character his lifes great parents have 
tavern	 been  married for 75 years this is great man  mary theyre funding my quest  will yeah taking a year off from college  marisha its my bar mitzvah money  travis we do need to have one guest thats got the silver spoon and has never suffered tragedy in  his life we need a super optimistic person  will everything will be fine come on we can befriend the dragon  wendy almost clover but not quite almost does have the tragic backstory  mary parents still alive  wendy everyones dead  travis everyones dead 
dung	  matt just me and the dm no npcs  marisha a friend of mine eric campbell whos been on the stream a few times in his current dd  campaign that hes playing hes playing a guard from whitestone in our world who saw vox  machina come in do these heroic feats and is like i want to be like those guys but hes got  parents a nice background hes going to hit the road because vox machina inspired him and then  find out how fucking terrible and awful it is hes real excited to be 
none	 broken and beaten hes  trying to be optimistic and a hero  mary i got a care package from mom and dad  will its their heads oh my god  travis whats in the box  all whats in the box  matt i saw a question in chat someone asked if the loss of the magic carpet was intentional and  making it difficult to enchant it was not intentional it was a particular danger in the  room to any of the players it was unfortunate that rolls  marisha the carpet took the brunt  
none	 will you saved me though thank you  matt the carpet took the brunt of it  marisha thats right i feel really bad for you guys because liam and i were like no and  youre like what the fuck is wrong with these people  travis we were in the other room we were outside in the studio  will theres the delay so 30 seconds after it happened you heard from the other side of the  room no  marisha you could feel the pain twice like it happened twice  travis you did it on 
none	 purpose  matt no i did not do it on purpose  travis id like to roll insight its all good  mary hes telling the truth  matt it made it so much easier for you guys to get from place to place when you had that magic  carpet  travis we flew over the underdark we flew over the whole encampment and stuff  matt it was cool it had a lot of utility  travis now were going to die quicker  matt these things happen lets see for the cast what predictions about where the 
dung	 story was  going did you make that turned out to be completely wrong or did you have any theories  that turned out to be spoton  travis clarota was a bitch  mary you never trusted him from the beginning  travis i said it but half the party was all about it i wrote it four times  mary i remember when you guys went down into that cave and i was like this is totally random and  everybody said dont do it and down you went i thought how much of this was planned was 
none	  there somebody there in the first place  matt there was i didnt expect them to ever encounter it for the next four or five sessions  let alone have it go so positively it was going to be an encounter but they managed to roll  socially in a way that convinced clarota not that they were friends necessarily but to the  betterment of his survival to infiltrate and manipulate  travis i thought the briarwoods were both vampires and somebody was going to turn vampiric  im not going to say it was an easy fight 
none	 but i thought somebody was going to be on deaths door  legit not just because of the ziggurats antimagic zone  mary laura was  travis that was after was that because of the fight or was it because of the ziggurat  mary no vex was before you guys went to whitestone wasnt it  travis going down to one that was down in the ziggurat  mary no it was outside the castle she cast finger of death  matt shes done it twice  mary shes done it twice before you guys got the carriage driver 
none	 i think this is right finger of  death and laura was two points away from dead  will youre already up your fun is wrong your fun is wrong laughs i want one of those i call  that  marisha do you want to answer that question  matt this is a good question because this comes up often will cooper willmortis asks  matthewmercer how open are you to ideas and suggestions from us about allies for vox machina  to encounter im careful because it is my game world i have a very specific layout as 
none	 to how the  things in the story ought to go if i do intend to possibly in the future put this content out for  you guys to utilize i have to be careful with copyright stuff and not using too many outside  ideas because then it gets a little tricky plus a lot of people that have submitted stuff have  been like hey i have an item id like for someone to use it does plus six damage and gives  them the strength of four gods okay thats cool yo  travis whats wrong with 
none	 that give me that thing  mary you have it its called bacon  matt or ill get npcs that have a 14page backstory that is fun to read but the focus is on  the players ill try to bring in what i can so instead weve done a couple of circumstances  where weve incorporated npcs that fans have submitted as part of a contest and well start  hopefully doing that more as the year progresses there will be opportunities for that and youre  more than welcome to send stuff in i dont have time to 
none	 read everything unfortunately my free  time is gone forever now and i accept that but well have contests and stuff and incorporate  stuff for fans weve had fans that weve lost due to illness or circumstances in the past that ive  incorporated into the game weve had fans who were sick and weve brought into the game as  npcs as well and weve had contests in the past and hopefully do more of those in the future  as far as how open to it im careful because it is still my game and i dont 
none	 want it to be too  much of a door i open where everyone throws everything and i no longer have control over it  and i have very specific balancing ideas too but there will be opportunities  will youre right though its one of the reasons why legally your favorite television  show you cant go and write a script for it they cant read it because then if it shows up later  then they can say hey i wrote that its one of those things that its a cool idea but you do  have to 
none	 be careful when youre building your own world that its just yours  matt yeah if i ever intend to try and release anything in the future like a campaign setting  which i would love to the question comes up often i have to be very careful about that  thats the largest reason  will hes not being uncool hes being totally prudent you have to though its important  matt there will be opportunities in the future  marisha and a lot of the players get that too and were on the same path what do you 
none	 not get  that travis  travis laura texted me and said my pulledup pants look weird like that  mary and will wow  travis its hot in here i was pulling the pants up  mary i thought we were waistup  will im sorry im also about to get married so the idea of livestream nagging is amazing to me  wow  matt shushes whip crack  travis you dont know what its like living with a dragon  will could you make a masculinity throwing save  matt thats an eight  travis advantage two 
none	  will thats awesome i love that shes hysterically funny your rolledup pants look  weird  matt preciously insane on reddit asks whether matt has ever had to discard any cool ideas  because of the players going in an entirely different direction or because he felt it wouldnt fit  in the world often but i hold onto them because that could come into a oneshot in the  future or if it comes back around in the story they return to the same place they continue that  thread possibly and like i said if i ever 
none	 end up wanting to release a setting it would be a  cool thing to put into the world that even if vox machina never encounters you guys can in your own  games so yeah i hold onto it all not everything gets caught its part of the fun of the  randomness of the game is you never know where the players are going to go ill put a lot of effort  into maps and threads and be like all right cool so today theyre where are you going  travis i loved it in the prestream 
none	 games youd show up with these two bags and five or six maps  and i remember there was one night a six or sevenhour game where no maps were put upon the  table you were rolling them back up and i was like were those for tonight you were like  they were going to be and we didnt go any of those places  matt it still happens here often but thats fine  marisha my favorite was still when we snuck in the back door of the clasp the first time and we  were like 
dung	 knockknock oh hey clasp leader hey whats up were here to decapitate you and  we didnt plan any of that and youre like oh you walk in let me start drawing real quick and  starts drawing things hes like clasp leader is there it was good  travis off the cuff  marisha oh no it just went dark its another one going off that ivar mistbornelite asks how  often do we strategize outside the game which is never really  travis strategize  mary but do you think about it during the week i remember going 
none	 well we ended that and weve  got frost giants coming up what can i do  marisha its impossible not to think about it  travis i really wanted to look to see what their traits are and stuff but i cant  mary i didnt do that i didnt cheat  travis i wanted to cheat im saying i wanted to cheat  mary i was like i really want to find out about white dragons but no i did think about what  could i do  marisha ill do that honestly i think more often than 
none	 not ill be like goddamn it percy  totally had the last word i should have said this  will oh youre doing the drive away from the fight  marisha i should have done this  will the jerk store called and they ran out of you  marisha and ill be like next time  matt to be fair taliesin is the master of the oneliner bookend he throws out some of the  best hell wait for the perfect moment and then im sorry boof  will but theres a genius to that being able to button 
none	 a scene there is a genius to that  marisha but ill spend the week being like next time i see percy im going to give him a piece of  my and it never happens  matt what you guys were saying about the creature stuff dont forget ingame you can research  creatures that you know you may encounter out in the world to learn about what they do and you  can depending on how well you research and retain the information learn things like weaknesses or  what type of abilities they have  travis me 
none	 research he aint going to read  matt you have a problem with that  travis but if it has pictures  will i asked you about that because you were bringing me back and i said look i havent  been able to watch the show lately what should i know and you were the first person to go you  know what youre in a whole different part of the world you shouldnt know anything going on so  come in the way you came in before theyre coming to you so you shouldnt know what was happening 
none	  i was like okay yeah that makes more sense i wanted to research and you were like no you  dont need to  matt for instance in the game laura has a very strong knowledge of dragons thats been her  favored enemy for a long time you guys could spend time and really delve into what threats they  pose beyond your encounters and who knows what you might find  mary exactly working for the slayers take how much time have we had in the library after  encountering a rakshasa or the dragon how much 
none	 time have we had to do our rakshasa  will you and i talked about a bunch of that stuff coming back in where we all met up and we were  there 20 minutes before matt got there  mary and will what have we been doing  will what was the last mission we were on we came up with a backstory for each other for our  relationship  mary why were together  will why were friends and why weve hung on and all that kind of stuff friends all the  people on the internet 
none	 just friends but yeah i love that stuff  matt any other questions burning right now  marisha travis do you think grog is unable to be corrupted by craven edge due to his lower  intelligence youre too dumb to be corrupted  travis i dont even think grog thinks the swords trying to corrupt him hes just a chatty sword  that for some reason talks to him thats it he got the battlesound lightsaber at target and it  talks  marisha is grog convinced that its in his head and its like wilson and tom hanks 
none	 in castaway  travis i think he thinks its just loud enough for him to hear so hes always like i have no  idea how that sound actually works  matt i wasnt expecting you guys to retrieve craven edge from the corpse i wasnt expecting it  to be kept and i definitely wasnt expecting it to be handed to you and now im so excited to see  where this goes  travis you didnt think wed keep it  marisha he told me later he thought wed throw it into the acid with everything else  
none	 travis fuck that noise id throw percy in if he tried to do that  mary im still waiting for the calvin  hobbes mashups of grog and craven edge i put that out  there  travis i wasnt equipped for that shit in the monk pit that was unexpected i had trouble  putting baby down  mary baby didnt want to be put down youre not picking up a flaming hammer instead of baby  matt interesting question from duetempte in reddit says how do you balance combat around six  to eight pcs especially one or 
none	 twoenemy boss fights best fast answer as i can when you have  that many players you have to keep running quickly taking initiative is a huge thing for  initiative when i ask from top to bottom in chunks of five 25 to 20 20 to 15 and what i do  is write the players names down in the order and then if an enemy falls into that order ill write  it in the column to the right of it staggered it almost looks like a backandforth line so i can  tell one column are heroes 
none	 one column are enemies and i have them in the order that they  show up in initiative that way its very easy very quick to write down and visually its easy  for me to reference whos up next but for balancing you dont always want to give something  more hit points because that means its going to take longer with a lot of players you still want  it to be around long enough to be a challenge i recommend increasing damage it deals because it  doesnt mean you have to have as long an encounter 
none	 but still have that threat of serious  danger not crazy damage but scale the damage it deals a lot of creatures have legendary  resistance and legendary actions which are very helpful  marisha thats some bullshit its such bullshit  travis you get three per round or something  matt oh my god youre seven players thats fair  marisha it sucks when youre like im going to burn this 5thlevel spell and its going to be  fucking amazing and it cant fail because the spell says oh legendary resistance oh  matt so sorry maybe dont 
none	 start off with all your powerful shit  will wow you know what would help the deck of everything or whatever the hell that thing is  matt no  mary wand of healing do you guys ever go home and have moments of contention about what occurred  in the game  will im so glad that was the question i thought it was going a different way im so glad that was  your question ive got to be honest with you im glad thats where you went  mary do you ever roleplay gilmore  will thats 
none	 what i was waiting for do you ever go home and have moments of contention i was  like thank god  marisha what was that tweet that we got that they tagged you me and liam in it and it was like  god vaxs voice is so sexy hey marisha do you ask matt to do vaxs voice for you i was like  out of everything out of all the fan art fanfic now you done made it weird thats the line  right there we found it  mary but did stuff happen in the game 
none	 and do you have to take moments of breathing or do you  realize its just a game  marisha only a few times getting the polearm in the face i was like really all three attacks on  keyleth  matt you can barter with an npc you cant barter with the dm  mary what  will whip crack  mary did you hear that i hear that one too  marisha so many whips in the atmosphere not too bad though every game we have people being  like oh shit matts sleeping on the couch tonight 
none	 and im like no its fine  travis that doesnt happen at your house when i almost smacked trinket and he ran through the  minefield  matt you deserved that  travis generally everybody laughs and when you clean it up youre like man that was fun  shes like you never do that again oh shit its just a game she was like and went  upstairs babe i love you  marisha i love it so much  travis imaginary bear what nothing  will totally real  mary start doing bear sounds downstairs  travis bearlike 
none	 grog is okay  matt a twopart question i want to answer a couple of these pseudox1 on reddit writes with  some enemies that vox machina has faced every once in awhile a pc gets oneshot by something  do you plan on oneshotting someone when they come up against these enemies to provide a challenge  or is it a side effect of the monster  all the ones theyve come across have been actual side effects of the monster like the banshee  thats what they do its a nice way to bring in challenge especially when 
none	 you have certain  players that are really resilient every now and then its nice to remind them that not all  attacks just do damage some of them snuff you out its a cool dynamic to it because it  immediately turns the tide of the battle to not only intense danger even if its not a very  powerful creature to survival as well as being on the aggressive which is great it adds tension to  it other part of the question when listening to players monologuing with each other you look like  youre staring into 
none	 their souls what is usually going on in your mind during those im  remembering nick at night reruns usually dick van dyke show  will youve got sings meow mix jingle  mary flatline sound a nice 1k tone  matt someone please edit that and at one of those moments when the players are monologuing my  brain going off on the gilligans island intro  travis when you were monologuing i actually leaned over to laura or to you and was like he  hasnt looked down yet because you were explaining the history of the world 
none	 and were  always looking for a little bit of and come back up and you were up here the whole time im like  hes a god  mary it was such an amazing monologue  travis it was insane it was six minutes  will it was the history of the world  matt i was afraid it was going to be boring i didnt realize i was going to be telling you guys  the whole and that was the condensed version  will i love that though oh hes talking about how the world was created 
none	  marisha its creation myth time  mary its like greek mythology weve got all of it up until  matt you guys never got to the point where you inquired about the creation myth of exandria and  what the second spark was the penance and all these other terms youve come across at points in  the game it all plays into that world and that might be unveiled more as time goes on as now  youre looking for the vestiges which do tie into previous time periods but yeah as soon as you  guys started 
none	 inquiring about it i was like okay  travis we do go back and watch those things though because theres no way some of us catch  that the first time around youre a good notetaker but im like  marisha even so though im generally scribbling hot words because i cant get it all oh that  seems important key points  will i scribble them wrong i was home later that night going whats a vestibule  travis the vegetables of the portents  will were looking for vegetables whats going on  marisha someone said matt how 
none	 hard was it to decide to destroy the city of emon after you spent  so much time to build it additionally how early in the story planning did you decide to destroy  the city and what caused you to take that route  matt thats a great question it was very difficult id spent a lot of time developing and  fleshing out this entire city and id set the stage for it a long time ago i didnt quite know  the form it was going to take i just knew that the chroma conclave depending on 
none	 events that  transpired and the return which was going to coincide with i know i had a twoyear window of  winters crest festivals i was keeping tabs on that that was when they were going to be  signifying the release of thordak from the fire elemental plane it just so happened that emon  became so central to the campaign at that time and based on his previous experience being sealed  by the adventuring party that now largely incorporates themselves with the council of  taldorei that would be the first place to strike  and 
none	 its not just emon theyre hitting a lot of other targets of major power that have some  history with members of the conclave and it was a tough decision but it made sense driving forward  for the story it brought together a moment where players themselves their characters were starting  to wonder what their purpose was it was a really great crux moment unintentionally i had this  whole story arc looming and the characters were hitting interesting points of having an  existential crisis of what is it thats holding us together what is our purpose 
none	 and i was like oh  my god this is going to be perfect this is going to be perfect boom and dropped it it was so  good  mary the minute vax said i dont know what were doing why are we doing this all of a  sudden i was like you did not plan that out i seemed at that point that you said to liam just  plant that because the bombs ready to drop  matt that whole conversation im sitting there going just give me 30 minutes just give me 30  minutes 
none	 man its coming it was so great it was very hard but as a writer sometimes to  really elevate the stakes of a story which is what you want to do when it continues like that  you want to elevate the stakes and bring everything back to a core central focus and make  everyone feel the gravity of whats to come you have to destroy something that you love and emon  happened to be the gem of that time  mary plus they were getting complacent theyre all on the council theyve got a nice keep 
none	 its  all lovely  matt youve got to mix things up a little i was glad to bring that twoyear seed to bear it was  fun  marisha thats crazy two years  matt what was your favorite pc that youve played as  mary victor  matt pc like when ive actually played a game actually my friend jason bender whos a game  designer he ran a game years ago where i played a dwarf fighter my first time playing a combat  character in a dd game i was always casters before that i played 
none	 a dwarf fighter named  grimthorne which i actually incorporated into exandria as the dwarf that ran you guys through  the brawlers league that character is my old pc grimthorne he was a fun brash character  travis he was our manager right  wendy the wheels are turning oh yeah that guy  matt yeah shaved dwarf with no hair on his body and most of the dwarves shunned him for that  purpose  travis he took us through that tournament right  matt yeah he took you through the brawlers league tournament yeah where scanlan summoned 
none	 a  pony and you cut it in half to intimidate the other team and it worked  travis i didnt just cut its head off i smeared its gore all over us and we started screaming like  crazy people  matt and travis like you do  mary wow  will fair enough  travis you know youve done well when mercers eyebrows go up especially like oh  matt did percys demon get stronger with every target on the list that he killed maybe also  what would have happened if he killed all five or six 
none	 counting cassandra i dont know i guess  well never find out  marisha he does this all the time i dont even know anymore  matt but glad youre paying attention  travis what did you say  matt nothing  will whyd you write kord on my head  laughter  travis kord i mean krod moans  matt lets see what are your favorite snacks or drinks that you like to be gifted at conventions  mary apparently beer  will be careful how you answer this i said twizzlers once as a joke and everywhere i 
none	 go now  i get twizzlers  travis i get bags and bags of reeses pieces and i like them i dont drink them  marisha i would say good note though please dont bring us weapons at cons dont gift us  weapons  will important safety tip  travis weve got to fly with them  marisha weve got to fly and we have a hard time getting them home  will bet tsa likes that  matt yeah we had a few great weapons gifted to us at this recent convention which were wonderful  gifts and 
none	 thank you guys for those and we had to go through wizard world and find a way to ship  them back to us for that purpose and it was a whole  will blade scraping yeah im in seat 1a  laughter  mary sir your warhammer is flaming could you put it out  marisha theres no smoking on the aircraft  matt somebody at the con gave taliesin a pepperbox replica with an actual spinning barrel  a very small one but a pepperbox replica he was like this is really beautiful oh god im not  
none	 checking luggage so he took it in two pieces and put them separately in there in the hopes it  wouldnt be a problem sure enough tsa stopped him from going through he had to fill out all  this paperwork spent 30 minutes this is the same tsa where the guy recognized me and sam so i walk  over to check up on him and the guy goes over and goes oh of course itd be percy and he helped  actually explain to tsa what it was and that hes not trying to hide a gun through 
none	 we actually had  a critter as part of tsa that was helping taliesin not get arrested for trying to carry a  150yearold firearm  will do you mind proving youre percy roll a d20  travis they take you into the mirrored room and its like  laughter  travis am i going to jail or walking out  mary thats right  matt i will happily run an improvised oneshot to not go to prison  travis i saw there was a person that was asking about do we have too many magical items i think  
none	 its important to say that you told us that we can only have three  matt three attuned  travis attuned to us yeah so we dont walk around and be like oh im going to use this  matt you guys have been collecting magical items for over three years now thats the thing they  have a number of them and a lot of them are circumstantially helpful i try not to give out  too many you only really get one major upgrade every six months or so or somewhere in that  neighborhood i try to 
none	 make it more special so when you do find one its a cool thing if you  give out too many too quickly few have the impact and its not really awesome when you find  something new  will you guys tend to have a lot of stuff i remember the last game lauras like no 750  knickknacks and were all like oh okay knickknacks and shes like no its written  here he told me i had 750 knickknacks tons of stuff  mary whos got the skull wheres the skull  travis oh i found out 
none	 where it was because vex is a sneaky bastard  matt vex was the last person to have it  mary vex was the last person to have it okay  marisha she hid it im pretty sure  travis she didnt hide it i rewatched the episode  laughter  travis i missed it the first time i miss a lot of things the first time i missed percy doing the  shadow thing  matt that was so beautiful that worked out perfectly  mary do you know what math is  matt someones asking tophlitz on reddit 
none	 asks if i was part of the black rock city cuddle puddle  travis what  matt burning man yes i was good to hear from you thats really cool its a burning man  gathering event its really cool  will the black rock city cuddle puddle  travis cuddle puddle  mary are you guys dressed as rabbits  matt no thats the billion bunny march  marisha not to be confused  matt this is a bunch of strangers all getting together and cuddling and hanging out and telling  stories  marisha whereas the billion bunny 
none	 march is a bunch of strangers dressing up as bunnies and  protesting the man  travis how often do you rewatch episodes only if i feel like i missed something important but  normally thats a character choice too but i dont catch shit  matt ill rewatch beats of previous episodes as im preparing for the next one to make sure i  remember all the details of how it ended and try to pick up from there try doesnt always work  but i try and to remember npc voices  marisha good question marisha are you 
none	 going to awaken trinket someday no im not  mary what does that mean  marisha no and thats my quivering palm question is are you going to awaken trinket  no i cant actually trinket is literally too smart for me to awaken him and if i ever did it  would mean that trinket could theoretically be like oh what youve been my master this whole  time vex well fuck this shit im out and i dont want to ever do that so no  travis i wouldnt ever do that  marisha its her bear its 
none	 vexs bear  mary what does that mean to awaken  matt its a spell that druids have creatures that have certain lowlevel intelligence you give  them human intelligence and the ability to speak and converse they essentially become npcs  marisha do we want to read it  travis how smart is trinket  matt trinket has an intelligence of four smarter than the average bear  groaning  travis thats so lowhanging and you its running down the jowls  matt and yet it is 100 percent accurate  travis and mary it is  marisha the 
none	 target must either have no intelligence score or an intelligence of three or  less  mary and what is grogs intelligence  travis and marisha six  will he says proudly six  travis i remember when we were rolling the character and i rolled it and it was some awful  roll and youre like your intelligence is six i was like yay whats that mean  matt i cannot implore you guys enough to really embrace low stats as a character its such a  wonderful distinguishing trait for your roleplaying capability im disappointed when a  
none	 player doesnt roll anything lower than a ten im like oh man what a missed opportunity i  absolutely adore as a player and as a dm rolling at least one or two low stats because it really  exemplifies all sorts of crazy shenanigans youre going to get into in the future  will that totally gave me my character because i didnt know what i was going to do did i want an  accent i had no idea and then i rolled a nine charisma and i was like hes a dick  travis yes awesome  
none	 matt which also i want to point out is another great example both you and keyleth are great  examples of characters that have low charisma a lot of people equate charisma to physicality and  appearance and beauty and that is one way to do it for some people they look like the kind of  person you would listen to or follow very politicianlike they have this spirit to them  and this visual perspective you guys are relatively attractive characters but  personalitywise not you your dd characters  will and marisha oh sure  travis yeah 
none	 you two are total trainwrecks  mary keyleth is fucking hot  marisha thats why we do voiceover  matt exactly  will ive got the body for voice over  mary and a face for radio  matt but a perfect example kashaw has such an abrasive personality that even the most average  individual is more likeable in general despite your appearance than kashaw is you rub everyone  the wrong way and thats the perfect way to play a ninecharisma character  will it was so much fun to play that and also its one of those 
none	 things where he does things  where its this great juxtaposition where hes a dick and he tried to intimidate the last time  hes got a minusone for intimidation so hes like hows your family this isnt going to  work its like if i tried to intimidate somebody not going to work all right sorry  travis hows your family theyre doing well  mary thanks for asking  travis the boys in soccer  will it was so much fun to let the numbers dictate i wasnt used to that so yeah it helped  the character 
none	  matt someone asked here matt have you ever considered dwarves with notscottish accents  yeah i love the scottish brogue its my favorite dialect of all and so i revel in the chance to  utilize it and ive grown up around fantasy tropes of the scottish dwarf the kraghammer  dwarves are definitively mostly scottish they have some variations in there theres some west  country theres some that fall out a bit dwarves in other regions would probably have different  dialects so if ever you guys travel to other regions and meet other regional dwarves perhaps 
none	  there will be variations lets see if they have any other ones weve got time for another ten  minutes of questions before well take a short break and well come back for our battle  freeforall  mary zahra doesnt know about percy and lillith  travis she doesnt  mary nope zahra got a letter from lillith saying that she had an interesting time with the guys in  emon but she didnt name names lillith is not a kissandtell  will kashaw is  laughter  will telling everybody what just happened  mary she told 
none	 me about the world itself but not specifically  travis what happens to vox machina when everyone reaches level 20 or something like that  matt oh thats a good question im foreseeing currently the campaign has probably another good  year little over a year before everyone were to reach max level i dont know if well get that  far there is a definitive arc to the story and it will progress to the point where the heroic  deeds of vox machina hopefully whoever survives to that point will be battling deities and not  just worlds 
none	 but also realmsaving circumstances at which point there will come a moment where the  story comes to completion whether it be through the fall of vox machina and the next wave of  heroes that rise up to try and take that place or they will complete their goal become the heroes  of the land and fade into the sunset to pursue whatever their epiloguebased storyline is which  you guys would help to write  mary they come back through the wardrobe and theyre kids again  matt in which case i would like to start a 
none	 new campaign with the new levelone characters you  guys would create probably in the same world after the events of the first campaign there  would be elements of the universe that youve affected with your choices  mary lycan rat  marisha i was going to say wererat  travis have you ever made a character that went to level 20 anybody thats played before  matt ive had a campaign that went close but not quite  travis what do you mean not quite meaning you stopped playing  matt meaning we stopped playing because adults get 
none	 busy and lives scatter  marisha was that the ravenloft campaign  matt the ravenloft campaign ended at 15 and the previous campaign ended around 15 as well  travis deities  mary theres some spells that you only find on another plane  marisha eventually we go god hunting  travis god hunting did you see the size of that dragon back there were fucked next to that  thing  marisha ghostbustersstyle god hunting  will are you a god  marisha if someone asks if youre a god  marisha mary and travis you say yes  
none	 matt tiamatzx asks question for mary what are your thoughts on the friendship between vex and  zahra  mary oh wouldnt you like to know maybe youll find out i think zahra has not had many friends  in her life ill put it that way  will neither has kash  mary yeah and those that she does have the few she holds very dear and i dont think that level of  devotion has any idea its a level of passion that goes beyond the plane of physical  attractive theres an attraction to someones soul and 
none	 i think thats what she feels  will i think kash is the same way where its almost confusing to be with somebody that you  actually care about  marisha keyleth feels some of that its a weird feeling sometimes  matt quick question to answer here since i get questions about house rules a lot why did you  choose to make inspiration the normal one not a bardic one a d6 instead of the default  advantage that was partially because there are a lot of abilities and situations that give you  advantage already in the 
none	 game i felt it would be a tweak where you could in theory combine the  two i like the disadvantage and advantage system a lot i think its one of the best things they  did in 5th edition to streamline combat and get rid of a lot of the floating modifiers that i felt  bogged down combat in other systems i felt like this was a way to incorporate it where those that  could still get advantage and consistently get advantage based on how they play would still be  able to benefit from the inspiration 
none	 die mind you because theres a bard in the party and such  a good bard i dont feel that i have to throw it out there too often you guys are pretty  selfsufficient in giving your own inspiration  will thats amazing watching him  travis isnt it if you want to talk about genius weve got genius doing storytelling ive  asked him im like do you come to the show with two or three songs in your pocket ready to go  and he says no because hes a cappella mensa level from college right  
none	 mary the fight song come on  marisha he has the limericks hes been writing down the limericks thats been a very new thing  though hell be like ive been listening to top 40 more recently thats pretty much all he said  hes like im trying to listen to the radio more  will its amazing to sit there damn  marisha hes crazy hes great  will totally awesome  marisha its all that ucb training  mary im pretty sure i saw him and his sister eden in les mis when they were in it on 
none	 broadway  will oh who hasnt been in les mis on broadway  travis lets wave a flag over some furniture  will we cant eat bread okay i get you come on take your prison time and shut up  laughter  marisha his story by the way at this wizard world panel  mary oh it was amazing  marisha yeah if anyone hasnt seen the wizard world panel he has a story of him as gavroche  falling off the barricades and it was in the middle of the miami riots back in the day and he 
none	  went to the hospital and was like i fell off the barricade hes all smudgy  travis the doctors like you were on the barricade  matt this little kid  will hes dressed like a french peasant my god boy what the hell were they doing to you why are  you still harmonizing my god  marisha you have to watch him tell it though we cant even do it justice but its great its a  good story  matt lets see weve got time for a few more questions and then were going to take 
none	 a break  and come back for the freeforall  will oh my god ive got minutes to live  matt yes you do  mary its going to be so exciting  matt interesting question matt have you ever gotten a tpk or killed most of the players in the  party yes actually in the last campaign i ran the players went into the shadowfell and in this  particular world necromancy had been banned and outlawed for a hundred years so undead and the  whole idea of undead creatures largely was folklore no one saw them 
none	 people thought they  were old wives tales to keep kids in from outside and so when they actually went to the  shadowfell they were unprepared wandered into a tomb and were surrounded by ghouls and as  opposed to focused targeting down they decided each of us take one and kill them off well  then three of the five were immediately paralyzed and were torn down and two of the remaining party  members one of them started screaming while the other grabbed her and pulled her out as they  watched the three other party members 
none	 be devoured by the ghouls that were there  marisha remember how when we were fighting the banshees they have an ability where they can  touch you and youre down ghouls have a similar ability where they touch you and youre paralyzed  and you get canned so if you split up the divide and conquer technique is probably the worst that  you could use against ghouls  will backs to each other  marisha yeah pretty much  matt in that circumstance they lost three party members in one battle that were eaten they  watched them 
none	 be eaten in front of them  mary oh thats awful  will now what do you do quick question what do you do youre playing with seven players and you  put them in a situation where four die how do you come back next week with the three that are left  matt what i do is in that time period i would get with the players that lost characters  mary why is he pointing to you  travis i dont know  matt because youre there i would see if the remaining party members had options 
none	 in which to  attempt resurrection at their disposal see if that was successful or not preferably before the  end of that session if any of those were not successful and the players were lost permanently  then over the next week i would meet with the players that lost characters to have them create  new ones probably a level lower than the lowest member of the party  will and meet up with them  matt and meet up with them and find a way to incorporate them in the story where they would  then become 
none	 a member of vox machina going forward its what ive done before in the past there is  a detriment to losing your character i do bring you in a level lower not starting at level one  because that would be stupid  will you also lose your character  matt exactly  will horrible  matt thats how i would do it thats how i will do it  groaning  matt cackles all right each of us pick a question to finish this off if we can im sorry  if we didnt get to your questions 
none	 this is a lot of questions here tonight and not a whole lot of  time we have record of these ill try and answer them on reddit later  travis somebody asked if i could repick the people that went into the earthbreaker groon pit  would i do it no a i didnt understand what you were actually asking because he was speaking in  such a poetic way and i was trying to give you an intense struggle shit im missing all of this  i dont know what hes talking about and you were like who 
none	 are your blahblahblah muses  and i was like my muses pike shes not here shit in case we fight whos good oh vax has  daggers and scanlans my pal and we jumped down and theyre like oh were fighting and i was  like fuck  will the second he got pushed into the pit i saw your face go aw shit  marisha i misunderstood the question  will all the blood drained from your face  travis the first five minutes i was going through my mind how it would have gone if i had  
none	 picked other people but i wouldnt have changed it for a second  marisha it was great  mary vax and scanlan  travis it was so great  marisha it worked beautifully  mary oh will we see salty pete and the gang again  matt i dont know  marisha and mary i dont know  matt one of the members is up in seattle now and another member only occasionally comes on for  another game maybe it was fun definitely a unique experience doing that if we have another  extra lifetype stream like we did 
none	 because that was very successful and we had a good time with  it as much as it was a gamut for me to run with you guys helping with the story deck of many  things if it happens again i would love to have them all back so well see if we can get them and  schedule them for it i hope so  mary oh that was good somebody said what color dragons would you all be  matt what color dragons would you be  marisha in real life or our characters  matt lets 
none	 say in real life  marisha in real life  matt i cant answer a character question all of them no  marisha red  travis aint those the bad ones  matt yeah  travis you would be a bad dragon in real life  marisha that firebreathing man fire dragons  will youd be a bad dragon that was such an earnest question  travis i was expecting more from you  marisha a chromatic dragon just peacedout  travis whatever voldemort shut up  will she who must not be named  travis id be a gold 
none	 dragon  mary would you be a gold dragon  travis id call myself kanye  marisha so influential  travis im a wordsmith youre welcome for my existence im an influencer  matt im going to make you play that if we ever do a oneshot  laughter  travis ill start smiling and then go  matt there you go  will ive got a good question from twitter how open were you for me to create my own deity as a  cleric  matt i was very open  will you were suggesting to make one 
none	 up if you want to make one up i dont know how other dms  run the game but you were very open to suggestion and heres what you could do and let me help you  a little bit here but it was more what do you want to be and you guided me as opposed to  this is what you do and heres how you build it  mary you encourage that i was like ive done research and i want to do this youre like no  dont pick anything thats established you run into problems 
none	 with people nitpicking what you got  wrong about the lore and everything else make your own which was so wonderful  will they always say write what you know  matt tailor it to the rules so for you your whole moon deity worked well for the great old one  pact because it was an entity that is outside of the pantheon and you dont truly understand the  nature of where it comes from just from the sky it was a perfect tiein to that and with you i  didnt want to define anything and i 
none	 said you can choose from the existing pantheon of the  world and i laid those out for you and i said you can create your own deity but understand  that based on the current rules that it would probably be a much more confined belief system a  god that doesnt have the same following of the others thus why its a receded worship than  other gods  will which then guided the backstory of how nobodys ever heard of vesh and theres one  person that knows who she is and thats kashaw  matt it 
none	 worked out perfectly  will it worked out great so yeah it was very cool  marisha i had a question scroll by and forgive me i didnt see the name of who it was but they  were asking about being a female playing dd in an allboy group and how you break that comfort  level luckily i think especially now with the resurgence of dd the boys club aspect that  might have been surrounding it is definitely slowly starting to get broken dd should never be  a genderspecific game at all its tough its also 
none	 where you grew up and where youre located  and the part of the country i know growing up in kentucky i didnt have access to anybody  especially other females that would want to play with me but yeah if you feel uncomfortable i  try to remember that its probably a little bit of them feeling uncomfortable on their end as well  so try to be openminded to that and i think youll get used to it but theres not supposed to  be gender specifics and guys we have a ton of our players that like 
none	 to rp girls were all  actors maybe the best way if youre a female in an allguy group fuck it make a male character  as well  mary or be the strongest most feminine roleplaying character that you can be  will im sorry i should mention that the guy who asked that question was paleheathen whose  picture is actually with you and laura  travis yeah i like him  matt good question i will say too ive played with many players that have created characters  that are across sex male players who made female 
town	 characters and vice versa you see me play female  characters all the time its not a defining facet of the character  marisha female should never be a personality trait  matt yeah exactly it can guide elements to it down the road but you want to create an  interesting character who just happens to be male or female i know some people have some weirdness  or theyre not comfortable trying to play someone of the opposite sex and thats totally fine but  youd be surprised how cool it is sometimes to jump into the character 
none	 thats so different from  what youre used to and see how one it can be a very freeing experience from a roleplaying  standpoint and you might learn a lot about yourself  marisha actually theres a really great video thats on youtube that someone linked me to this  past week and it was from about three years ago before the fine brothers milked this format and  it was boys a group of tenyearold boys playing dungeons  dragons with a group of girls for the  first time did you see that yeah and it was 
none	 great and i love kid logic because i feel like  it really simplifies what were all actually thinking on its purest form and all the boys at  the end of it were super mature and were like oh this is great they were like the girls  were really bloody and violent i thought they would puke at the blood i didnt know that girls  could be that violent im like yeah man so i feel like the kids realizing that there really is  no separation is quintessential how everyone feels  will its also a 
none	 flatout awesome improv exercise  mary it really is  will it really is to play the opposite sex for no other reason that its really cool to open up  and be free  marisha and ultimately to be 100 percent honest i really enjoy people who have implemented  dungeons  dragons in elementary schools as teaching mechanisms and there have been a lot of  people whove used it for kids who have social imperatives or social awkwardness things in real  life  will i deal with anxiety so i know exactly what its like to 
none	 deal with that kind of stuff  marisha yeah totally and i think it really does teach you empathy on a different level and you  really can put yourself in the shoes of someone else that youre probably nothing else like  keyleth has taught me a ton playing keyleth has taught me a ton because i dont really consider  myself anything like her in real life so playing something super empathetic shes taught me a lot  and i think everyone can learn from that thats my tangent im done  matt one more question this ones 
none	 come up quite a few times from different people someones  asking about balancing encounters for creatures that could easily take down one member of the  party but would also be difficult to fight for another that would be a good challenge for one  member but would completely annihilate another person in the party how to handle that how does  the party handle that thats a great point of tension in the battle if a player knows that  theyre squishy their tactics should revolve around learning how to stay away from that  creature that could 
none	 probably take them down very quickly and its the tougher members of the  partys responsibility to try and get between them as much as possible  will that was sam last week hes the first one who said that hes like i dont fight so im  going to sing and run this way  matt so yeah you want to incorporate aspects of a battle that will be a challenge across the  party but you also want to make sure that you dont tailor every enemy specifically to a player  all the time like this guys 
none	 a barbarian he has a lot of good resistance so ill build a creature  only for him and then go for this character find a good challenge for the overall party and  let them figure out the mechanics sometimes theyll run really well and combo their abilities  together like a welloiled machine and theyll completely annihilate the encounter sometimes  theyll do the entirely wrong tactic that they should and end up walking away limping going  that was bad that was very bad sometimes it will go really poorly and they have to run thats  
none	 the good thing too i always scale on the level of making the encounter difficult as opposed to  too easy if youve done a few encounters that the party has steamrolled because if it gets too  hard you can insinuate you dont have to stick around they could always come back later with a  better plan if the first plan failed in fact some fun battles are the vengeance ones where  things didnt go so great the first time but going back with the knowledge you have now you  set up an ambush or find 
none	 a way to use the terrain to your advantage next time  will real quick do you have to be real careful that you dont pick on one specific person too  much like you keep attacking one character  matt it depends on the creature or monster that theyre fighting if its a beast if its a  creature that is driven by instinct and isnt super intelligent it will go after whatever is  either the easiest and nearest kill or the thing that apparently right now poses the biggest threat  to it i try to think 
none	 of the creatures mindset of who it would go after so if the battle begins and  all of a sudden the healer does something really crazy and flashy and hurts the enemy it might be  going after the healer for a while  if its a really intelligent creature especially if its a welltrained combat veteran that knows  the strengths and weaknesses of different classes once a few rounds of combat have shown who  specializes in what he may tell his team or whoever hes commanding to focus down the healer  or the support class 
none	 thats changing the tide of the battle if they know the barbarians going to  resist the most damage theyll ignore him for now take out the things that are supporting him  and keeping him up and then well worry about him later  its based on the intelligence of what theyre fighting and i think for me thats a lot of fun  sometimes it doesnt work out sometimes the party comes up with a really cool plan and my really  awesome interesting battle gets steamrolled but you know what the players earned that victory  im 
none	 not going to fight and change numbers behind the screen just because i wanted it to be cooler  they earned that victory ill give it to them  travis so glad were not fighting him tonight because i just got infinitely more nervous  will im sensing youll be fine  matt all right guys it is 900 were going to take a short bathroom break and then were going  to come back here and see which one of these fools is going to be the final standing fighter  mary place your bets  will ive got 
none	 ten dollars on everybody but me  break  marisha cock  matt welcome back everyone so were going to see how this works out thank you marisha so  for the purposes of this everyones going to be level 13 so bringing both kashaw and zahra up one  level i need you guys to both roll additional hit points right now which well add to your  character at the moment so d6 for you for you itd be a d8 im pretty sure  travis are you playing as gilmore  will this is my eight right 
none	  marisha thats a ten  will five  mary four  matt four plus your constitution modifier which is two so yeah thats 83 whatd you roll  will i rolled a five  matt you rolled a five plus whats your constitution modifier  will 16 oh plus three  matt plus three so eight so add eight to your total hit points for the purposes of this  battle  will so i am at 108 for this battle  matt oh wait warlocks may be a d8 let me go check this again im used to 
none	 the sorcerer stuff  let me see here real fast  travis im going to do what laura would do and warm up this d20 shit fuck thats the same  number  matt yeah a d8 im sorry reroll it im not used to you warlocks  mary what if i roll less than a four  matt well ill let you keep the minimum  mary i rolled a three  matt well let you keep the four its my fault  mary oh thank you  will have i been killed yet im surprised im not dead 
none	 yet to be honest with you  travis we havent started  will i thought i was killed my bad  matt all righty so since your proficiency bonuses have also gone up dont forget that your  spell attack your spell dc and your physical attacks all go up by one for this battle  will so my spell attack goes to plus ten and my spell dc goes to 18  matt 18 correct  travis this set is amazing by the way im so excited by it  matt this is my first time using dwarven forge 
dung	 sets which ive always wanted to i was a  kickstarter supporter when they first did the dungeon tiles i was stupid and didnt get them  prepainted never making that mistake again so ive drybrushed all of these with white to make  them look decent i hope to use more dwarven forge stuff in the future for our game because it  makes for some really cool dynamiclooking sets so just so you guys are aware for this battle  this open pit here in the center is an open pit it falls into darkness you dont know 
none	 whats  below there  travis what are you talking about really  matt yeah this is an open pit  will so grog push everyone push grog into the open pit  mary its an open pit how deep is it  travis you dont know it falls into darkness so its deep enough  matt youll have to go and make a perception check next to it so you can see  travis what if theres a giant trampoline down there  matt could be  will has anybody thought about the idea of meeting in the center 
none	 and talking things out  travis i would like propose a pregame handshake under breath i will throw all of you in  marisha instead of violence we can solve this with rock paper scissors itll be great  will there was something you said about a 7thlevel spell  matt you and zahra both get access to a single 7thlevel spell casting also you have access to  all the equipment you have on you except for healing potions each of you only has one superior  healing potion  will and what does a superior healing potion do 
none	  matt 8d4 plus eight  travis okay all right  will 8d4 plus eight youll have to explain to me exactly what that means when i need it now do we  need to pick our 7thlevel spell now  matt i would prefer for you to i mean you have a couple prepared but you have to choose which  one you use in combat  marisha so my armor with spell resistance ive got advantage on spell attacks against me i can  get saving throws my armor that has spell resistance  matt you get advantage 
none	 on your saving throws yes  will i think i know what im going for my 7thlevel  travis im ready to die  will seriously are you kidding me  marisha oh my god this is so nervewracking you guys  matt all righty guys  mary im very afeared now  will i got my 7thlevel i think  matt all right folks i would like all of you to roll initiative for the sake of this guys  because i forgot my bag of side minis which is really stupid of me the part of kashaw will 
none	 be  played by this rather buxom dwarf cleric the part of zahra will be played by this redcoated percy  so you guys can keep track on that all right  mary i suck big balls and i cannot lie  matt you know you have advantage on initiative  travis i rolled it twice and they both suck  matt as all of you are suddenly and instantaneously transported by some omniscient  entity you find your feet slamming into the stone ground of what appears to be some pit a hundred  feet recessed into the floor 
none	 of some indeterminate location the walls and the floor are built of  ancient stone you see each of you placed behind a wall with just enough visual across the top to see  that the other of your band are there across from you in the center lies a darkened pit to some  unknown distance of depth  marisha grog  travis this is nice stone  will z  mary over here  matt looking up into the sky you can see the blue sky clouds drifting above but too high to  reach you hear a 
none	 voice rumble up from around you going now show me who is your champion so  initiative 25 to 20 anyone 20 to 15 giggling 15 to ten  will i have a 14 oh wait im adding my initiative wheres my initiative front there we  go  marisha you have plus two  will okay so im a 16  matt 16 all right so kash is up first five to ten  travis ten  marisha oh i have 14  matt 14  mary ten  matt grog and zahra who has the higher dexterity between 
none	 the two of you  mary plus one  travis probably not me 15  mary oh dexterity ten  matt all right ill say grog is going slightly faster than zahra all right based on that kash  youre up first what do you want to do  will i want to get my papers im already losing  matt youre right over here  will yeah i know yeah i want to move closer to grog i guess  matt okay you can grab your mini  will now how far can we move here  matt well 
none	 your speed is i believe 30 so you can move six square spaces  will maybe thats not the best plan  matt whatever you want to do buddy  will if i can stay away from him the better you know what im actually going to make my way  around here so six squares im going to get right here and i want to check out the room and  the giant pit which i am now apparently in front of  matt okay so go ahead and make a perception check  will thats the d20  
none	 matt yep d20 and add your perception skill  will that is a seven and wheres perception plus four but it has advantage  matt okay so roll again  will now its two four so great  matt okay so you look down what little bit of light is making it down you can see vaguely the  bottom of the pit about 15 feet down ten to 15 feet so its not a huge drop you do see there is  texture to it meaning its not a flat surface there is something down there that probably at 
none	  least it doesnt look like it would happily accept your body plummeting into it  will ah it is not feathers im sensing thats going to come back to suck at some point  matt all right is there anything else you want to do for your turn  will no im good for now  matt okay  marisha going to get straight into this i guess i am going to cast call lightning at 5th level  matt call lightning at 5th level okay you guys all of a sudden feel the hair on your body and 
none	  your beard drift up almost like gravity suddenly has no impact on the moment as the smell of  crispy ozone hits the air above you you can see clouds gather out of what was once a blue sky you  hear in the distance the rumble of thunder  travis looks like rain  will im not dressed right for this look at the size of her breasts  mary use them as a shield kash  marisha then i say im really sorry about this you guys i think this is an alternate reality  though and 
none	 well be fine if we just get out of this i can go ahead and bring down a spell  right or no yeah i can the same time  matt yes you can  marisha im going to go ahead and hit kashaw because i can see him through my little window  will suck  matt all right  marisha i get 5d10 right  matt yeah 5d10 points of lightning damage i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  will thats a d20 again four  matt plus your dexterity  will three  matt 
none	 all right im going to say thats a fail so you take full damage from keyleth at this  point  will and its how much  marisha sorry kash 5d10  will never should have kissed you  matt thats a terrible roll youre lucky  marisha that is a really terrible roll 17 and another one  matt 18 you take 18 points of lightning damage as a bolt of energy slams out of the sky like an  elemental hammer hitting you and causing you to hold yourself against the wall directly to the  back  
none	 marisha and then i take my bonus action to turn into an eagle  matt okay  marisha eagle sounds  will i tried to check out the room a little bit first see what was up  marisha fuck that shit shits getting real  matt so a giant eagle or just an eagle  marisha giant eagle  matt all right since i dont have your polymorph figures with me  no audio until 21740  matt scatting  will do i have to tell you my 7thlevel spell eventually  matt whenever you want to use it 
none	  mary ooh surprises  will im using a 7thlevel run away spell  mary run away thats my favorite  offscreen they can hear you right now but now they cant see you were working on it  matt but now they can hear us  mary kash put your pants back on oh no  travis is that a beholder coming out of the pit  mary no no not a beholder dont eat grog  offscreen program glitch youre doing great  no audio  offscreen they can hear you they cant see you  matt okay 
none	  mary they can see grog but they cant hear matt  will now they cant hear or see either of you but they can smell you all  matt for those who were paying attention keyleth after casting her 5thlevel call  lightning turned into a giant eagle and then flew 80 feet up into the pit  marisha fly away  travis can you move diagonal squares  matt yeah you can this is getting interesting well in the meantime we shall see if we can get  this to work rip sound oh no  travis one 
none	 plus one plus two plus one  will can i ask a question while she is an eagle is she considered a creature now can she be taken  control of if shes an animal  matt thats a good question  mary because you use polymorph right  marisha beast shape  will could you use geas on her  marisha i keep all of my mental stats  matt oh a creature anybodys a creature  will okay  matt any entity is a creature whether it be a monster or a person  travis it says we 
none	 can see the board but not you guys  offscreen yeah they can see the topdown right now but the shot right here doesnt have audio  for some reason were fixing that  matt can they still hear us and see the top down okay well then never mind lets get this  running well stick with this all right that ends keyleths turn grog  travis i would like to go into a frenzied rage i would like to move ten spaces right there  matt all right as a note if you are raging and you dont 
none	 take damage or deal damage you lose  your rage  travis oh so should i maybe move first and then rage  matt or not rage if youre not going to do anything  travis oh im very calm as i run from this spot to here preparing to rage  matt okay good to know  travis shit i dont think i ever knew that you learn something every day  matt yeah if you fail to hit something or get hit which happens very rarely for you anyway the  rage drops something to remember  travis 
none	 hit a little kid in the area if i have to attack something cmere boom  matt all righty so if thats ending your turn zahra youre up you see the eagle of keyleth  take up after calling a bolt down from the heavens  mary youre beautiful darling  will good now kill her  mary all right i would like to cast because she is within range of 120 feet im going to do the  combo of eldritch blast a cantrip plus an invocation of agonizing blast  matt all right so the invocation goes on 
none	 that are you casting that first  mary pardon me  matt meaning the eldritch invocation just happens on top of the eldritch blast did you have  another spell or bonus ability you wanted to do beforehand or not  mary no i think im going to save it because i realize that casting hex actually takes up one of  my spell slots does it not  matt yes but you can always move it to different targets if one falls  mary yes i know  matt okay good to know all right so eldritch blast firing 
none	 against all three against  mary all three against kiki  matt all right whats the range on eldritch blast  mary 120 feet  matt yeah shes definitely in range all right whats the ac of your eagle  marisha 13  matt 13 all right go ahead and roll three d20s  mary all right do i get a spell attack bonus  matt you do plus 12 so dont roll a one roll three times  mary roll three of the d20s  matt thats a hit thats a hit and third one 19 thats a hit 
none	 go ahead and roll three d10s and  its plus seven to each of them there you go so 17 points of damage  will hurts doesnt it  mary 17 plus  intermittent audio  matt 13 so 33 a total of 33 points of damage  marisha okay well that brings me zero to my 33 so thats nine points  matt did you drop form now  marisha yeah  matt okay first off make a concentration check for each one of those hits its a constitution  save  marisha i have a ring so 14 
none	  matt 14 roll again so you have to beat ten on each one  marisha ooh no eight  matt eight so as youre hit with the first agonizing blast it slams into your form and you  keep yourself in the air the second one hits you again this time the clouds disperse as your  concentration is wrecked from the blast the third one finally hits you losing your form you  transform back into a druid and immediately plummet 80 feet to the ground  will and you dont have the big breasts to block you 
none	 like i do  matt so thats 8d6 falling damage  offscreen were back  matt were back all right hold on you take 28 points of fall damage as you fall down into the  pit smack slamming into the stone ground your bell is rung for a moment as your eyes have a hard  time focusing around you you can feel the blood beginning to pour down the side of your head from  the impact of slamming into the stonework  marisha oh bad idea okay  mary just a warning dont hurt kash just a 
none	 warning dont hurt him  matt all right zahra anything else you want to do with your turn stay there  mary no i think im fine  matt kash youre up id say actually keyleth you are prone on the ground because you fell that  height  will can i see her or no  matt yeah you can see her barely around the side  will i dont like grog right behind me that kind of scares me a little bit  travis but im so stealthy  will maybe he doesnt see me im going to 
none	 give myself a little protection here and im going to  cast a 4thlevel guardian of faith  matt okay  will im going to get a little help in an area here if i can  matt certainly 4thlevel guardian of faith  will and apparently the range is 30 feet and it lasts eight hours so if i hang near him  hopefully thatll be helpful  matt so any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within ten feet of the guardian for the  first time on your turn has to succeed or take 
none	 damage all right so you choose an unoccupied  space within range and it occupies that space so where do you want it to remain  will can i move first and then cast it  matt yeah if you wanted to  will all right id like to move back to kind of where grog was so im going to go counting so i  end up about here id like to cast the guardian of faith right here in front of this little  window  matt okay im going to go ahead and use this piece of 
none	 popcorn here as the guardian  will he guards me and is wonderfully crunchy  mary he smells so good  will thats my yeah so for right now im good and i feel a little bit protected  matt keyleth youre up  marisha oh me again already oh my god okay well i stand up  matt uses half your movement  marisha im going to go ahead and throw a call lightning up again this time at 4th level  matt okay the clouds reform  travis what the shit this is like seattle  will rain 
none	 again what are we in london  marisha i think ive got a bit of a view on grog kind of know where he is  matt ah barely  marisha i can see kash though right sorry kash lightning crash right on kash again  matt all right i need you to make another dexterity saving throw  will and thats the 20 again right come on come on eight plus what dexterity plus two  ten  matt plus your save which would be more yeah you still failed so 4d10 lightning damage to  kashaw thats better 
none	 29 points of lightning damage as another bolt streaks down slamming into  the ground  marisha im going to use my bonus action to do a cure wounds or sorry healing word at myself  just at first level  will okay so i take 29 points of damage is that what you said eesh 61 already  matt all right keyleth thats keyleths turn grog youre up  travis i would like to perform a little community outreach and i would like to run frenzied rage  matt thats your bonus action okay  marisha this is the 
none	 shit of nightmares i want you to know that  travis i would like to look at keyleth and go hi and attack  matt this blur of grey and black comes streaking around the corner as you see the foam frothing  from grogs mouth running toward you craven edge out of its scabbard  marisha keyleth friend keyleth friend  travis 26  matt hits  travis 14  matt 14 misses  travis 24  marisha hits  travis 21  matt 21 points of slashing damage  travis it was the third one that hit 18 
none	  matt 18 points of slashing damage  travis and she needs to make a constitution check  matt two of them  marisha 18 would bring me to 40 right  matt 40 all right so roll two constitution saving throws  marisha ooh  matt succeeds with both 18 and 16 you hear the voice creeping in your face go come on take her  life give me her strength  travis well im working on it shit relax a little  will i love the fact im sorry i have to point out that were being guided 
none	 by mummra which is  kind of awesome im sorry  matt ancient spirits of evil all right so that ends your turn grog zahra youre up  mary can i move first so i can get kiki and so sorry my darling  matt where are you going  mary im going to go toward keyleth so i can get her in sight  matt you can see her there  mary all right im going to cast  travis just do it  mary finger of death  travis shrieks does she have that  matt she does 
none	 now  will oh shit dont look at me  mary i look like percy so no mercy percy  travis do you have to roll for it  matt hold on hold on okay  travis well fuck the foreplay lets get on with it  matt constitution saving throw it is a spell so you would have advantage on the roll for your  armor  marisha oh thats good thats good 17 thats good for the first one and a natural one so ill  take the 17  matt all right plus three so you make 
none	 the save you take half damage go ahead and roll 7d8 plus  30  will 7d8 plus 30 what  travis you have that  mary just today i dont know i woke up i may need your help  matt chat room well that escalated quickly  travis 16 youre having me help you with math thats four one more  mary grog and zahra do math  matt so you take 30 points of necrotic damage  mary plus 30 oh yeah that was 60  matt yep 60 and half that so you take 30 and 
none	 youre still up at ten hit points as a beam of  greenish necrotic death streaks across this battlefield slamming into your side unexpectedly  from behind as youre staring up at the horrible form of grog raging in front of you you feel most  of your vitality sucked out of your body immediately you glance over your shoulder and see  zahra around the corner going  mary slightly possessive of kash sorry im so sorry youre too beautiful  matt all right kash youre up unless you wanted to move still  mary no ill stay there 
none	  will i think wait i have to see how close i can get id like to move first my guardian is going  to stay there i could stay there and ride it out let them fight it out seriously scanlans  tactics im going to move closer to the battle here so im going to go counting wait wait  hang on  travis oh into the pit you die  will i guess it doesnt matter where i go im still not going to be able to see her am i  travis theres a window is 
none	 there a window matt or is it supposed to be a wall  matt its a window  travis through the window to the wall to the sweat drops down dragons balls  will so can i see her  matt just so youre aware that didnt use a spell slot no because its part of the mystic  arcanum ability you get to use that once without spending a spell slot  will wow thats a good spell so can i actually see her then through said window  matt keyleth you could yes but she would have threequarters 
none	 cover if it has a spell attack  roll she would get a bonus to armor class  will im still going to try to give her if i can see her from there a 5thlevel flame strike  okay so thats what im going to do  matt okay  will she came out swinging i was like hey lets check it out  travis i was coming over to say hi and then it was like explosions  mary you totally frizzed my hair with that fucking lightning so bad hair day is all zahra  needs  
none	 matt its a tenfoot radius so youre getting this area so i need both of you guys grog and  keyleth to make a dexterity saving throw  marisha dexterity save  matt yes  marisha nine plus  matt you have advantage because spells  marisha so excited ooh thats much better 20 total  matt 20 that would do it so you take half damage from this  travis 15  matt i believe your dc is 18 so no  marisha what are you hitting me oh youre firestorming us  matt flame strike so roll 8d6 
none	 because its half fire and half radiant damage  will 8d6 is this the six yeah where is it i dont have yes i do so eight you mind if i  borrow these  marisha what does the cover grant you whats the threequarters cover do  matt it helps give you a better armor class but it doesnt help you against radial spells  will come on daddy needs to cook a druid here we go counting if its on critical role all  right so theres 16 30  matt 30 you roll two more  will 
none	 i roll two more sorry  matt so theres an incredible roll 39 so 18 points of damage you take 39 points of fire  keyleth is now currently unconscious right there  will try fighting now  mary first kiss my ass  marisha anything i can do to fix myself while im out  matt no you keep making death saves until hopefully youd roll a 20 and maybe stabilize  well if you roll a 20 you fuck i have to remember the roll you come back to consciousness  with one hit point  marisha but 
none	 i have to roll a nat 20 other than that thats it oh man  will you started with lightning striking me thats not something you forget yeah thats my  turn  matt keyleth i need you to go ahead and roll a death save  marisha yeah totally nope  matt all right so thats one failed save go ahead and mark that off grog its your turn  travis i would ask a question is there any way i can move just up against the wall so that keyleth  and zahra are in a straight line 
none	  will oh thats not a good sound thats a bad question  matt oh not really i mean depends on what you want to do if youre trying to ricochet keyleths  body  travis no i have the javelin of lightning but it only works in a straight line  matt yeah youd probably have to hit one or the other  marisha im also on the ground  travis im going to hit keyleth on the ground  matt youre going to hit keyleth on the ground  travis yeah isnt she down on the ground  
none	 matt yeah you can separate your moves and your attacks you can hit then move then hit  travis ill hit her once and then move im going to pimp slap and run  matt okay because its a melee attack within five feet its an autocrit which is an immediate  two death saves how do you want to do this  yelling  mary oh my god what  marisha come on come on all that pentup aggression youve been wanting to get out  travis i pick up craven edge over my head seeing her there unconscious 
none	 i turn my head away turn  the point down and go whack  matt and with that you hear an attempt at breath and a slight gurgle as your eyes are closed as you  draw the blade you hear a satisfying yes delicious two more grog  travis ill do my best do i get an extra attack after i make my move because i killed someone  matt well you have your bonus action attack anyway because you have your frenzied rage so you  still have your movement and two more attacks  travis all right 
none	 i would like to move to zahra please i would like to do like joaquin phoenix  and swing away yeah joaquin phoenix in signs see and swing away grabs the bat and he beats  the shit out of the alien i would also like to do reckless attack on these  matt all right not great weapon master though  travis no reckless advantage and whoevers fighting me gets advantage 24 is the first one  mary yeah that hits  travis 18 is probably going to be good enough 27 on the second one  matt both 
none	 hit you only get two attacks on her  travis oh thats right  matt yeah because you killed keyleth with one  will while she was unconscious while she was down and unconscious awesome  travis ten 18 for the first one  matt so 18 points of slashing damage  travis 12 20 on the second one  matt so 38 points of slashing damage against you zahra i need you to make two constitution saving  throws  marisha grog off the leash is a bad day  matt yeah man you guys best bet was probably 
none	 to gang up on grog and you guys let him stick  around this is going to be rough  mary what do i need to do  matt roll a d20 twice adding three each roll so thats a fail second one again success so your  strength goes down to ten as craven edge saps a strength point from you you get a plus one to  your strength which brings you up to 18 i believe so currently you get a plus one to hit  and damage on all your attacks  travis a beautiful thing 
none	  matt i believe thats the end of grogs turn because you cant do much else zahra youre up  mary i would like to tell grog how much i love him  matt dont forget as a reaction before your turn ends if you wanted to use your hellish  rebuke  mary i know but do i want to let it all go now  matt its either that or have him cleave your face off next turn  travis its always an option face slits are always in  mary out of nowhere a voice comes to 
none	 me and says use hellish rebuke and so as a reaction  i shall  marisha now im envisioning grogs rhinoplasty  matt make a dexterity saving throw  travis 19  matt he succeeds so he takes half the damage roll 2d10  will come on you can do it z  mary 14  matt so he takes seven points of fire damage to grog  marisha god he is made of meat and hit points  will made of meat hit points and shame  matt what are you at right now grog hes at 134 hit 
none	 points guys  mary fuck you  matt seriously grog has rolled some of the best hit point rolls ive ever seen in my life and  then he took the toughness feat and has a constitution of 20 its stupid  will so we cant kill dude  mary i know witch bolt is a concentration so i cant hex him is that correct  marisha whenever he fails that save on finger of death thats fucking  travis tell me she only has one of those a day right  marisha one for free without burning a spell 
none	 slot  matt its one of those things where if its a concentration spell and youre not using it to  concentrate generally just a oneoff thing ill allow you to concentrate on two things at once if  you use it as a oneoff spell so i would say if you wanted to hex somebody and then do a witch  bolt but not have the concentration effect id allow that  mary i dont know what that means  matt what that means is as long as youre not maintaining witch bolt ill let it not override  
none	 hex because youre just doing it as a oneoff spell  mary okay but what if i want to keep it going  matt then hex would not overlap with it  mary im going to witch bolt grog  matt it is also a ranged spell attack which means you have disadvantage to hit him with it  because he is right in your face you can step away from him to try to do it  mary im going to hex him if i eldritch blast am i still at disadvantage  matt same thing disadvantage on blasts 
none	 because hes right up in your face youd have to get away  from him to do that  mary all right im going to use my cloak of the bat and fly away from him but he gets to whack me  then doesnt he all right wait let me is that considered an action  matt well it depends on what the ability is  mary cloak of the bat allows me to fly at will  matt all it does is give you flying so you dont turn into a bat form it means you can just 
none	 fly  so you can do that  mary and then do i still get to cast something afterwards  matt let me pull up the book real fast  will like a kid at christmas over there  travis no im not getting excited about anything because if christmas is any indication shit can go  south i got a remote control car crashing crying i got a nerf football  matt you can choose to fly 40 feet its not an actual action to use it so you can do that  thatd be your movement  mary 
none	 id like to do that and cast evards black tentacles  travis what whose  will youll find out  matt are you going to cast that first and then go  mary no i need to get out of there before  matt okay so grog you get a swipe at her  travis yeah i do do i get advantage on my recklessness  matt yes though technically he does have reckless attack on him so you could attack him  without disadvantage i forgot about that so if you wanted to hit him with a spell your 
none	  disadvantage is canceled out by the advantage youd have on him because he used reckless  attack  mary im not sure i understand that  travis you roll once instead of having to roll twice and take the lower because you have  disadvantage but i gave you advantage so they cancel each other  matt so its a regular roll if you wanted to stay where you are  mary hes still going to cleave my face off next turn  matt yeah but he wont get a bonus attack of cleaving up to you if you 
none	 want to take the hit  to the face and run away  mary im going to take the hit to the face  matt all right make an attack grog  travis 15 was the total of the second roll im sorry so thats 24  matt that hits roll damage where do you want to fly  mary id like to fly over here  travis 21  mary fuck you  matt 21 points of damage to you  travis and a constitution save  mary not yet and id like to cast evards black tentacles would 
none	 you like to hear the  description  travis in explicit details  mary squirming ebony tentacles fill a 20foot square on the ground that i can see within range  for the duration these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain when a  creature enters or is affected for the first time the creature must succeed a dexterity saving throw  and take its not too much damage a creature that starts its turn in the area is already  restrained basically youre restrained  travis im restrained okay  matt thisll be the markers 
dung	 for the area this whole area is filled with dark tentacles  will and he cant go anywhere  matt its difficult terrain which means every five feet step you take it costs ten feet of your  movement  travis so my speed is halved  matt yep  travis shit  mary do i get anything else  matt thats your action if you wanted to use your bonus action to drink a healing potion  mary thats what id like  matt go ahead and do that you heal 8d4 plus eight  travis she needs to 
none	 make a constitution saving throw  matt thats right yeah so thats 14 roll two more 19 plus eight so you heal 27 hit points  thats the end of your turn kash youre up these black tentacles  travis come join the party its like an anime nightmare in here  laughter  will its tempting whats also tempting is my guardian of faith thats still over there waiting  for me  travis orville redenbacher  will yes he will protect all no  marisha orville  will i think right now while he is trapped there  
none	 matt that is eight plus three that is a failure you lose another strength point  mary can i use luck  matt if you have luck yeah  mary 15  matt yeah never mind it doesnt happen  will it is getting down to the nitty gritty he cant move now which is  matt that you know of unless he makes his save  will oh well thats disappointing with the way hes rolling tonight im guessing hell make the  save  travis so i have to make a save to move or it just halves 
none	 my speed  matt at the start of your turn you have roll to see if youre restrained and take damage  will i think i got to hit him hard right now while hes away from there  travis no look shes right there in the open world  will i think im going to use my 7thlevel firestorm  marisha yeah you will  matt are you using it on both of them  marisha yes you are  travis you dont want to do that  will yeah i think i probably should  travis think about 
none	 all the poor tentacles that just came to life  matt thats true it might knock her concentration and lose the tentacle spell  will i imagine it might lose the tentacle spell but again with the way hes rolling i imagine  hes going to make his saving throw  matt the point is i guess from a technical standpoint if you just hit him the tentacles  will stay up if you hit both of them itll probably knock her down but you lose the  tentacles and hell be able to come after you next turn  
none	 will okay then i want to do the one where hell go back after her and keep me alive and well  which is what im guessing is going to happen  matt its up to you you can go after them both and take her out right now probably your call  whatever you want to do  will i dont want to take her out right now because then its just me and grog ive got  nobody whos helping me out  travis you might not get this chance again i mean were both right there  
none	 will how many hit points do you have 309 how many are there 7000 hit points youre at what  travis 134  will and youre at what how many do you have left  mary im sorry i didnt hear you i didnt quite hear you  will my hit points are so low i cant hear anymore  mary my hearing is gone apparently you lose hearing 57  matt she looks hurt  will you know what one thing at a time im going to go for grog right now and i want to make  sure 
dung	 she holds her concentration on the tentacles  travis i expected more  will youre still going to be like oh my god its the biggest hit ive taken all night im  down to 120  matt as youre currently dealing with all these dark arcane tentacles that are sprouting out of  all the stones around the ground a beam of light seems to descend from the sky for a second as it  turns to a dark red crimson and bursts around you in a giant inferno of searing divine energy  will hey how you doing 
none	 boom  matt it curves around and incinerates the remains of keyleth  mary bye kiki  travis sarah connor style  matt go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  travis oh wow really thats 21 its a 19 dexterity saving right yeah plus two  matt so you take half damage from that go ahead and roll 7d10 fire damage  travis 7d10  matt thats what she did to take out the wyverns  will are these d10 no those are d8 so i got these are all d10s here right nine does anyone  have 
dung	 one more i have six i need one more there we go  travis why would i give him mine i see a ten i see two tens  matt 43 points of fire damage you take half of that so 21 points of fire damage  will thats like nothing and then for the rest of my move right im going to run back to my  spiritual guardian and be like whats up that was my 7thlevel spell and nothing we barely  touched him  matt keyleth smolders grog its your turn  travis id like to 
none	 try and break free of the tentacles of love  matt go ahead and make your dexterity saving throw  travis its 14  matt 14 is a failure you take 3d6 points of damage could you roll that zahra  will just keep tagging him z  mary im trying darling im trying  travis what kind of damage there matthew  matt this is bludgeoning so you take half the damage so he took four points of bludgeoning  damage and you are restrained currently restrained to specifically read you what it does  your speed becomes zero 
none	 so you cannot move attack rolls against you have advantage and your  attack rolls have disadvantage you now have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws  will and youre still going to beat us all  travis i dont know its not a good thing  matt so grog what are you doing  travis im turning toward the black tentacle dealer right and im giving her the bird no i  would like to take the javelin of lightning and throw it at zahra  matt okay let me see the card you dont have to roll for it 
none	 its each creature in the line it  turns as you see grog the tentacles turn around and throw something toward you all of a  sudden it sparks with electrical energy and streaks toward you like a bolt of lightning  horizontally i need you to make a dexterity saving throw zahra  mary 12  matt thats a success so you take half damage roll 4d6 lightning damage grog  travis eight  matt so you take four points of lightning damage as the javelin streaks past you and skids across  the stonework behind sending a few 
none	 sparks and then falls to the ground its energy used all  right ends your turn grog zahra youre up  mary right so ive still got witch bolt on him yes is that what i used last time  matt no you used evards black tentacles  mary oh i used evards black tentacles which is technically a concentration it is so i shall  use is eldritch blast can i do a combo of eldritch and agonizing again using my cantrip and  invocation or is that considered concentration  matt well let me see agonizing blast isnt 
none	 a cantrip its an eldritch invocation which gives  you the benefit on top of your eldritch blast so yeah you can do that three times thats your  cantrip and you can do that yeah so all three against him or do you try and aim for your buddy  over there  mary no weve got to try and take out our giant friend  travis i feel so loved  mary its a compliment so that plus the agonizing yeah itll still hold the  concentration  matt let me see the javelin what it does yeah 
none	 i dont know what you guys are talking about you  guys are really weird oh and because it is four damage go ahead and roll a constitution save to  maintain concentration on your tentacles  mary ten  matt tens enough to keep it so the tentacles stay thank you for the reminder guys so youre  doing all three against grog all right roll with advantage on each roll because of his reckless  attack  mary so its 1d10 plus seven  matt go ahead and roll that twice a nine roll again  mary a

none	  travis bludgeoning  mary whats the plus 11  matt no its force damage thats to hit not damage plus seven that so thats eight points of  damage second one  mary five  matt five plus seven is 12 points and then this is the crit  mary four  matt so thats eight plus seven is 15  travis so 35 can i use my stones endurance to limit that damage  matt from the last one you can totally  will got an answer for everything dont you  travis no shut up so thats 
none	 14 no 15  matt okay so the last critical hit does nothing  travis okay great so 20 total  matt so as you hit him with the final hit it slams into him and he puts his chest out pumps  it takes the blast and it seems to disperse across his muscled form to no effect  mary oh it looked so good going in too  travis still pretty good you actually burned off the baby oil on these pecs  will thats what that smell is all right lets see if we can keep hitting 
none	 him  travis i mean look guys share and share alike  will im going to move a little closer to him  travis whispering yeah come closer  will so lets go there  travis leave that guardian alone he doesnt need to come  will he cant come hed like to but he cant he just hangs out there  mary hes eating popcorn the whole time enjoying the fight  will but he looks awesome he is hes guarding me just in case hes a place to run back to if i  need it im going 
none	 to do another level five flame strike yeah because i can do two level5s  right its better than raising the dead doesnt seem apropos at this moment i would have raised  you but youre ashes and you blew away my bad  marisha yeah thanks matt had to go into detail  will how do you think everythings going keyleth oh youre just ash  matt all right so against who  will against who  matt all right make a dexterity saving throw with disadvantage because you are restrained  travis 16  matt 16 not enough 
none	 thats a failed save do 8d6 damage against grog  will where are the d6s now eight  matt as youre being held back by the tentacles all of a sudden you see another streak of divine  energy come from the ground as flames erupt from beneath you your vision becomes nothing but  fire  travis not this again argh  will i have seven here here we go come on aw argh 21 and then one more come on 26  matt so 26 points of fire damage  will to drink my potion do i need 
none	 to be able to move  matt its a bonus action in my games so dont worry too much about that  will id like to drink my potion sir what do i need 8d4 plus eight is that right  matt dont forget you have your danger sensibility roll another dexterity saving throw  to be safe its things you can see like spells and traps  travis its a nine  matt nah  will so i can drink my potion  matt sure 8d4 plus eight so youre up next grog know what youre going to do 
none	  will counting  matt shitty rolls  will awful rolls so 22  matt all right grog i want you to go ahead and roll a constitution save real fast  travis i dont like the way youre asking ooh 11  matt 11 as the flames subside you take a moment to take in the damage youve taken theres a  familiar smell a smell youve smelled once before when trinket ran across a series of lightning  traps the smell of burnt hair as you reach up you find your chin clean  yelling  will i 
none	 took grogs beard  travis no what have you done  mary seppuku with craven edge  will kashaw the cleric takes grogs beard i want to see that fan art real bad that is the end of  my turn sir because i already moved out here so i cant move back  matt grog youre up  travis so i have to break free of the tentacle trap right  matt yeah top of the turn i need you to try and break free  travis son of a fuck no i have advantage on dex right  
none	 matt you are restrained currently let me double check really fast to make sure we have the  specifics here we havent used this spell before  travis wienerschnitzel  matt okay so you take another 3d6 bludgeoning damage because you started your turn restrained in  the tentacles so do another 3d6  mary oh thats better 11  matt so you take five points of bludgeoning damage round it down you have to use an action  to make a check to try and break free of it  travis well i would like to do that  
none	 matt all right go ahead and make a strength or dexterity check your choice  travis oh well i have advantage on both of those because im raging and i have danger sense  19 thats good what am i talking about strength thank you yeah 26  matt all right not a saving throw a check thats still enough you break free of the  tentacles break free using your action you still have your bonus action and your move though you  cant move quite as far which way are you going youve got two targets right now 
none	  travis i know im going to go towards ding dang dong zahra  matt all right counting you can just get up to her with your barbarian speed  travis and what do i have left  matt you have your bonus action still  travis just my bonus action ill take my potion my superior potion because i cant attack  anybody can i grapple or anything like that  matt you can attack with your bonus action you have frenzied rage remember  travis inarticulate yelling  matt up to you  travis awesome yes lets do 
none	 that lets attack her  matt all right go for it is this a reckless attack  travis yes 26  matt 26 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis you piece of counting 21 in your horned face  matt 21 points of damage to you zahra and a constitution save  travis oh 22 points of damage because i forgot to add  matt i need you to make a concentration check so roll another constitution save oh thats a  failure the tentacles vanish from the scenery as the spell disappears bye kernels i need you 
dung	 to  make another one from craven edge that is another failure you lose another strength point youre  now a strength of nine and you gain another plus one grog  travis plus one to attack and damage  matt well plus one to your strength what is your strength at now  travis now it is 19  matt so no bonus yet next time all right that ends grogs turn zahra youre up  mary all right my question is with my dark staff does this expend a spell slot  matt no its from the staff 
none	 itself  mary okay then i will cast witch bolt from my staff at 5th level that leaves me with one charge  left  matt okay using almost all the charges in that staff you still have to make a ranged spell  attack which right now would be at disadvantage but he attacked so it would be a straight roll so  go ahead and do that roll a d20 thats a nine plus your spell attack which is 12 21 whats  your ac  travis 19  matt it hits thats 5d12 points of lightning damage 
dung	 against grog five because she did it at  5th level  mary 21 plus 20 these two it was the nine and the 11 41  matt 41 points of damage to you grog lightning damage all of a sudden up in your face she  holds her staff in her front closes her eyes and a blast of dark lightning hits you  mary dont taze me bro sorry love  travis its okay im going to kill you soon  matt zahra is that the end of your turn you still have a bonus action  mary 
none	 i have a bonus action what do i do with a bonus action if i move does he get meh  matt thats zahras turn kash youre up  will okay so i have a question here  travis yeah you can jump in the pit  will can i great kash goes im out taps out and jumps in the pit if will was in the ufc same  thing you mentioned at the beginning of the battle that we are now on a different plane  correct  matt you are out of your normal vicinity yes  
none	 will okay but are we on a different spiritual plane do we know i have a question  matt you also know that you can cast lower spells at a higher level if you wanted to  will i know but my question is i have a wonderful banishment spell which is if were  from a different plane i can banish him and if i can hold the spell for up to a minute he cant  come back so can i banish him from the battle  matt whats the range on it  will 60 feet but 
none	 i havent moved yet  matt yeah if he fails the save you can banish him for a period of time to another plane  will but thats the thing according to the spell if were not from this plane he cant come  back its not just a period of time he doesnt return  marisha oh like youre going to banish him oh my god do this send him to bizarro world  will because we started you said we look up and were in a place we didnt know it seemed like  were in a different 
none	 plane so if i send him back  matt technically it would be the same plane its just in a different timeline  will okay so then he can return damn  matt if you were fighting in the hells yeah it would send you back to the prime material plane  and he would sit there  will okay so then it doesnt make any sense then  matt it takes him out of the fight for a while but its your call  travis yeah take me out a bit you two talk it out  matt what 
none	 are you doing kash  will i dont have a flame strike left thats my problem im running out of spells  matt with a 6th level you could flame strike both of them if you have one left of that  will oh i do have a 6th level  matt which would do more damage its your call  will but then shes going to die too  mary whispering i have resistance to fire  will well then thats what im going to do im going to use a 6th level and i will do a 6thlevel 
none	  flame strike on him  matt i was just shooting it out there  will no its a good idea i want to banish him i wanted to be nice and go away for a while but  he wont so lets drop a huge thing of fire right on his face so were going to do a 6thlevel  flame strike right now  matt all right so thats 9d6 points of damage to each of you do you want it to be radiant or fire  damage more its split into two types of damage so do 
none	 you want to do more radiant or more fire  damage  will what hurts more  matt they both hurt the same although shes resistant to fire so fire or radiant what are  you going to do just say one or the other  will im going to do radiant  matt so roll 5d6 right now i need you guys to both make dexterity saving throws  travis which i have advantage on  will 5d6 come on ive been rolling crap here lets go ones everywhere three ones 13  matt so you take 13 points 
none	 of radiant damage that is not reduced you take 13 points of radiant  damage then roll 4d6 more  will come on come on no whammies big money no wheatons come on  marisha oh my god so many wheatons  matt 13 again so you take 13 points of fire damage  travis thats not reduced by making the save throw  matt oh you made the save both of these are halved sorry i forgot about that you take half  of it so you would be at it was 13 youll take six points of damage 
none	  will im rolling like crap tonight it was rough it couldve been a huge strike  matt all right that ends your turn  will yeah it ends my turn oh wait i havent moved yet can i move back to my guardian  matt okay  marisha i still imagine that its a giant floating popcorn kernel  matt grog its your turn  travis right okay i would like to attack zahra and see how that does with the first of my three  attacks  matt all right make your first strike with advantage  travis 
none	 yeah 23  matt her acs 14 that hit  mary and marisha singing so never more shall we see you again  travis 21  matt 21 points of damage  mary byebye im out  matt zahra falls unconscious i need her to make a constitution saving throw  will come on z  matt you roll a d20 okay so she succeeds you are unconscious now on the ground bleeding out  as the blood that you draw from the blade you can see seeping into the outside of craven edge grog  what do you want 
none	 to do shes unconscious at your feet and you see kash in the distance rushing  near a wall  travis no i hit her again  matt roll with advantage twice  travis 28  matt that hits its an automatic crit so you lose two death saving throws mark those off you  dont roll damage she just lost two death saving throws shes on the edge you have one more  attack  travis is this my bonus action or one more attack  matt this would be your bonus action to attack yeah  travis and 
none	 i can still move i would like to run behind the wall over here can i down a superior  potion  matt you havent used your potion yet right yeah you can do that its not d6s its d4s 8d4  plus eight this is getting intense  will its not getting intense its a matter of time before he comes over and kills me  marisha youve done really well  will yeah because im just running away  marisha you are kind of taking the defensive route which is great  travis 28 points  matt all 
none	 right so you heal that up zahra its your turn i need you to make a death saving  throw  travis fail it fail it baby fail it for me  mary 16  matt thats a success so mark a success that brings us to kash its your turn you have an  unconscious zahra over there that you could finish off or toss a distant heal if you wanted to bring  her back or go directly after grog and try and bring him down  marisha there might be a cushy water bed in the pit 
none	 you dont know  will were sensing its not a water bed in the pit i dont know technically but were  sensing it is im at 83 so i dont have to heal yet you know what im going to move closer to  grog ive got to start doing some damage lets move i want to be able to see him i want a clear  line of sight on him if we can do i have a clear line of sight  matt no youd have to move over here to get a clear line of sight 
none	 on him really you could move  that far but then youre outside of your guardian which you can do if you want  mary chicken noises  matt so what do you want to do  will i want to get as close to grog as i can ive got to start doing some damage hes going to  fuck me up the next round but i have to be able to  matt you can get there  will and can i see him pretty well  matt you can see him all right  will all right 
none	 and i can cast them at higher levels correct so i guess that im going to have  to do some damage ive used my 7th ive used my 6th and ive used all my 5th i have two fours  left so i would like to cast spiritual weapon but at a level four  matt yeah you can do that  mary coughing heal zahra  will my heals are sore im running out of things  matt okay so you create a floating spiritual weapon  will and i think i can hit him twice with this 
dung	  matt i will make this little kitten your spiritual weapon where do you want to put it  within 60 feet  will i want to put floating death kitten right in front of him  matt all right little tiny floating death kitten so all right you have a spirit weapon a  giant cat bludgeon summoned by vesh and dark energy pours off of this floating cat cat yowl  every impact  will and now taste mittens  matt all right so go ahead and make a melee spell attack roll a d20 twice and add 
dung	 plus ten  take the higher one and add ten  will 28  matt that hits go ahead and roll is it a 4th level okay for every two levels so it takes 2d8  plus five damage roll that twice  will 16  matt 16 points of force damage so its not reduced  will mittens is death  matt cat noises youre being bludgeoned by a somewhat ethereallooking dark energy kitten  will thats right who hits you and then goes swipe noise  mary plus grogs allergic  will and now it says here that 
none	 i can then as a bonus action on my turn i can move the weapon up  to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature again okay so i want mittens baby  lets move around the other side and hit him again can we float him around the back or i  guess it doesnt really matter  matt go ahead and roll again for the attack 2d20  will 2d20 12 seven  matt so plus ten it still hits go ahead and roll 2d8 plus five  will five seven 12 plus five so there 
none	 we go baby  matt 17 points of force damage  travis i had exactly 17 hit points left so i would like to use my relentless rage  marisha oh he does have that  matt yep this is where things get real interesting  will yeah what exactly is happening damn you mittens  travis i have to make a dc 10 constitution saving throw if i succeed i come back to one hit  point  matt yep barbarians  will hey buddy i hope you fail just want you to know that  travis thats a 
none	 21  matt so you are back at one hit point that ends your turn kash  will yeah im done  matt grog its your turn  travis can i stalk toward kash  will slowly and menacingly hey buddy  travis how big are you  will oh shit im guessing 68 280 no im probably not huge i would imagine  travis can i attempt to pick up kash and throw him into the pit like grab him and sumogreco  whoom  matt you know what go ahead and make a grapple check roll an athletics 
none	 you can roll athletics  or acrobatics  will is it 20 let me see which is higher oh i dont have anything are these dex because i  dont have anything here  matt which is higher your strength or your dex probably your strength so roll a d20 and add  will yeah my strength is higher but my acrobatics are two  matt whats your athletics three so roll a d20 and add three  will 19  matt whatd you roll  travis 18  exclaiming  matt so as you go to grab him you 
dung	 get your hands on kash and as you begin to try and pull all of  a sudden kashs eyes go jetblack and you see this burst of dark energy around as vesh comes in to  protect the one cleric follower as that happens your hands are forced off of his form you still  have a bonus action  travis i do huh can i try it again  matt no its an action to try and grapple  travis so i could attack oh motherfuck and intimidate is an action okay yeah ill attack  him  
none	 matt great weapon master or not  will it sounds like youre helping him  matt ive helped you  will well theres a difference i suck  travis you have a high ac right  will i do wait high ac the attack bonus no my ac is 20  travis oh fuck no great weapon master well all right yeah lets try it this one great weapon  master reckless attack plus okay 26 minus five is 21  matt 21 hits go ahead and roll damage  will okay wait now i have a question too because 
none	 i also have a ring of protection and a  sentinel shield  mary thats all wrapped up i think  will does it okay  matt im doublechecking im trying to remember if grapple is  travis 35  matt so 35 points of damage  travis 35 points of damage and a constitution save  matt im doublechecking one thing because im trying to remember if grapple is an action or an  attack  will are you still at one  travis highpitched yeah just one  will your voice highpitched i could tell you but yeah 
none	  travis im kind of oneeyeing it  marisha if you get through this with one hit point  matt you also have an additional attack because it only takes one attack to attempt to grapple or  you could attempt another grapple your call do you want to grapple with your second attack or do  you want to hit him again  travis ill just hit him again  will what was the first damage 35  matt great weapon master or not  travis oh yeah oh it rolled over from a 20 son of a bitch 
none	 okay  will oh this sucks i cant do the math  travis no that wont hit aw it rolled over from a 20  matt so as the first strike comes down with craven edge striking across the armor it splits  and beneath you can see the red crimson already spilling inside make a constitution saving throw  d20 add your constitution modifier two i believe right  will yes four oh no wait im sorry three  matt its a failure so he steals one of your strength your strength goes up by one  will so 
none	 my strength goes down  matt it goes down to 16 doesnt make a huge difference so the second strike comes down  across with craven edge this time you put your shield up and you can feel the weight of it  almost pushing you off your feet but it streaks across the armor no impact that ends grogs  turn zahra make another death saving throw  will come on z  marisha roll a nat 20  mary 19  travis oh it rolled over from a one oh my god  mary it sure did  
none	 matt two failures two successes kash youre up  will i have one more 4thlevel spell i would like to do another 4thlevel spiritual weapon  matt it would replace the other one  marisha yeah mittens is still up  matt you can use your bonus action to send mittens there and do another regular attack or a  spell if you wanted to your call its a bonus action however you do need to make a  concentration check for the damage you took last turn what was the total damage of that attack  again  will 
none	 it was 35  matt total damage 35 half of 35 that brings it to well say 17 roll a constitution saving  throw  will and it has to be over 17 to see if mittens is still in the game come on mittens eight  matt nope mittens so mittens vanished from the impact but you can cast it again if you want to  will i can cast it again though and still hit twice with it cant i okay so im going to  bring mittens back hi baby so thats the last of my 4thlevel 
none	 spells okay  matt hold on let me check one thing really fast spiritual weapon checking one thing here just to  make sure lot of stuff happening really fast spiritual weapon is not concentration my  apologies so you dont have to do that  mary mittens lives  matt i look over and see travis going like concentration check im like shit right i need  to stop doing that mittens can move 20 feet and repeat the attack  will is she 20 lets get mittens over there  matt roll 2d20  will 2d20 come on 
none	 16  matt 16 plus your spell attack thatll hit go ahead and roll even at a minimum grog i need  you to make another constitution check with a dc of 15 now  travis yep yes 28  matt 28 still at one hit point grog takes the hit almost goes down and then comes right back up  at the feet angry  will okay so can i attack again  matt you can use your action now to do something else only a bonus action can do that so now you  have your action you 
none	 could hit with your spear or you could do another spell if you wanted to  travis now its 20 singing living on a prayer  will hes going to pick my ass up and throw me somewhere  matt you still have your action what are you going to do  will but i could also run back to my guardian  matt you could yeah hell get an attack on you if you run  will i think im going to have to hit him with my spear which has six points of nec on it right  
none	 yeah lets do that  matt all right roll 2d20 adding ten to each hit so go ahead im sorry adding nine  will 18  matt roll again  will four  matt yeah so you hit it the damage hits i need you to make another constitution saving throw dc  of 20 buddy  travis that wont do it thats a 14  matt chuckles how do you want to do this  yelling  travis wait dont i get saving throws and stuff  matt well in theory he could finish you off next round  
dung	 travis stammering all right  mary severe allergies  travis thats true severe allergies  will so is this a straightup attack with the spear  matt this is your dark spear the shadow spear  will so he walks over to grog standing in front of him and he looks him up and down you are the  biggest individual ive ever faced in my life see ya right through the chest  matt as the shadow spear pierces the front of your unarmored chest it goes sticking out the  back of your torso at that moment you 
dung	 can see his eyes go dark once again as the spear itself  sends this cold wave through your body the necrotic enchantment on the spear sucking the life  from you you watch as grog reaches out grabbing it but his muscles wither and atrophy within a  matter of seconds his face going sallow his entire life force drained into the spear as you  withdraw it from his body the now extremely malnourished shriveled body of grog crumples to  the ground with a cracking sound of bones against stone you hear in the back of your 
dung	 head now a  voice that says youve proven yourself worthy lift me become my new master  will can kash do something here  matt yeah  will he reaches down picks up the blade and says ive already had one dark master throws it  in the pit  matt blade spinning through air impact  i need you to roll another death saving throw  mary two  matt two and with that you hear in the distance this small exhale  laughter  matt as the last of zahras life force expires and her body disappears 
none	  will there can be only one  matt there was a slight chance you would have rolled a 20 and it wouldve been great if you  woke up and went  travis what are you at  will 43  mary no he wouldve taken me out  will 48  travis man youre sitting pretty  marisha wow  cheering  mary that was amazing  will that is ridiculously exhilarating it was cool  mary so much fun thank you  matt well done guys that was really interesting  travis you all wake up in 
none	 your bed and go gasps oh man  marisha i had a terrible dream you were there and you were there and you were there  mary and you werent there but i felt you there and you were evil  marisha i hope i never get on grogs shit list  will i though you were going to chuck me into the pit  marisha oh by one point  travis i thought you were lower i should have done another grapple check but hey  matt its okay  marisha and the maiden voyage of the dwarven forge 
none	  mary yeah  marisha it looks so great  will kittens and popcorn  matt ill remember to bring my proper minis next time  mary keyleth should feel very complimented that we felt the need to take you out first  will talk about coming in swinging my god  marisha falling through the sky as a dead bird  matt so yeah the pit if anyone would have fallen in there you saw the texture in the  bottom it was a cluster of undead that would grab and pull down and devour every single turn  
none	 youd have to roll to try and get out of the grasp if not youd be restrained and be taking  3d10 points of damage every turn  mary isnt there a spell that lets us control undead  matt there are spells like that yeah  will i have a question because one of the things i was going to do but then it looked like i  wasnt going to be able to if you take control of a creature you cant then have them do  something that will commit suicide right so i couldnt have taken 
none	 control of grog and gone jump  in the pit  marisha well is jump in the pit considered suicidal  matt which spell is this  will geas  mary what if you suggested to him grog i saw a cask of ale down in the pit go get it  travis id jump in there after that  marisha i want to get into some kilgrave shit  matt geas isnt a direct you dont command them to do a specific action you tell them to complete  this task for you and theyre compelled to do it 
none	 and if they resist it they take damage the moment  you send someone on a suicidal impact the spell immediately breaks  marisha but would hey explore the bottom of this pit be considered a suicidal action  will you still know youre sending him to a suicidal mission though right so wouldnt that  essentially break the spell  matt possibly but you could be like hey i need you to focus your attacks on zahra then he  could choose to do that or try to resist it and take the psychic damage  mary could i 
none	 have used mass suggestion to go guys theres ale or something in the pit go  find it  matt it wouldve been a hard sell with a really low saving throw roll a player could have been  compelled to lose a round to inspect but it wouldnt have been like yeah sure and then  dove in  will man that was fun  travis that was really great  matt also dont forget to check your casting times as well i dont know what the geas casting  time is  will casting times one minute  
town	 matt yeah that would not be a combat spell every round in combat is six seconds so that  would have been a spell you could do outside of combat  marisha what spell  matt geas  marisha oh right  travis nicely done matt nicely done kashaw  applause  will im just a healer  travis i guess you can put one more notch on that arm now  will hitting the deck though my god mittens  travis el gato es diablo  matt cool so yeah depending on if some point down the road we 
none	 have the opportunity like the  break after a major story arc when we run another one of these games but with the entire vox  machina party which would be fun that would be a ways off but you saw this was fun to do well  try that sometime  will id like to think as reigning champion id be allowed to come back to defend my title  mary you can think that as long as youd like  travis well free up our own summer slam  laughter  will oh thats awesome  matt and 
none	 a great example of the power of warlocks being nasty the survivability of barbarians being  ridiculous although it was you versus three magic casters which was not a good fight but even  so  travis i was getting blasted  matt and even so it came down to quite literally one roll because if that hadnt taken you out  that last spear hit if you would have survived that saving throw you would have had three  attacks on him next round and with great weapon master two of them would have taken him down  will 
none	 crazy powerful stuff running away is really helpful at times sometimes concession is the  better part of valor  travis black tentacles  will holding him there  mary my suggestion to travis was two of you both jump into the pit and then i lose my saving throw  and nobody wins  laughter  will its just that voice going guys  matt thats amazing guys thank you so much for coming  mary feel better laura and liam  matt yeah seriously there will be no actual session here me and marisha will be out of
