none	 its broadcasting kind of spontaneous oh theres some folks hopping in there we go hello  this was a random thing that happened so why not hi guys wow thats a lot of hey yas hi from  belgium too nice yes im wearing the same clothes from last night its been one of those  days i think i got to bed at 330amish anyway not hungover we didnt like drink  drink we just had a drink and walked to bobs big boy and had shakes and ate food you shouldnt eat  at 230am and woke up 
none	 feeling really bleh but its fine  dont apologize for not seeing the episode civil war is a very strong draw not a strongjaw hmm  that was kind of fun anyway this is a spontaneous thing doing a bit here before i go  ahead and do more work with marishas dad on our room glad you guys liked last night that was  interesting i guess part of this brief periscope is oh im sorry youre upset that i cut my hair  but i have to because itll just keep getting longer and it gets ridiculous itll 
none	 grow back  which is nice and has to go shorter before we can get longer again so sorry the mane will return  im sure in time  yeah i guess ill start with saying that man last night was crazy major props to the players  for actually pulling out some tactics there in a circumstance that was pretty rough i wasnt sure  how that was going to play out and a lot of circumstances a lot of really lucky  circumstances very good rolls on key moments really made a difference there its interestingly  frustrating 
none	 at times because when things happen too perfectly on a televised or a live stream  like that when certain rolls go so good its almost like man no ones going to believe  this but no ones going to fudge the rolls everyones policing each others die rolls and  its just incredible it was ridiculous  i think grogs arc of coming under the understanding that his strength comes from his  friends and not from himself was cool and his realization and using this to draw kevdak out into  the open was pretty neat i dont 
none	 want to give too many spoilers per se but between some very key  usage of spells and abilities some really good rolls for them bad rolls at certain key moments  for the enemies and some really great tactics they managed to why was fireball halved on  kevdak because kevdak is a totem of the bear barbarian they actually reduce all damage they  take by half except for psychic which is nasty for tank barbarians something that grog does not  have because hes a frenzied berserker  but anyway hopefully im not giving too much lag 
none	 here for you guys and i apologize if you are but  im trying to make sure that doesnt happen im trying to not to do the upanddown this time the  vertical i always forget to do that i feel awful after the fact im like ugh why did i do  that its easier to hold that way  anyway but there were some really hairy moments last night looking back on it too if laura  hadnt gone in there and done what she did with the broom grog would be dead if she had taken  
none	 more damage in advance to that or any of the attacks had got her she would have been dead  pike also very close to death what the party didnt know was if anybody but grog got the  killing blow on kevdak they wouldnt have stopped fighting the combination of having the one that  challenged him deal the final blow the one they actually knew was what gave them pause that  moment of the shift if just a random halfelf with daggers or if vex had shot him with an arrow  and killed him it would 
none	 have been less of a fall of their ruler to another power that  they understand and acknowledge it would have been just an assassination from a nameless  faceless creature they would have just been like he killed kevdak and kept attacking  the fact that grog managed to deal the final blow really put it in a situation where that battle was  able to come to a rest which was crazy and then the series of social dice i have seen a little  bit of discussion online because i always like to see how peoples thoughts 
none	 or opinions on ways that i  can improve based on feedback and stuff like that there are some frustrations some individuals  voiced with with the fact that the bloodthirsty barbarians didnt just continue to attack and  slaughter why would they even stop when their leader was killed these arent mindless  bloodthirsty barbarians some of their actions may fall into that category at times but understand  there are many different facets to a culture beyond just bloodshed they have people within  that they try and protect theres a tenuous social relationship with the river maw 
none	 that  theyve taken in theres a lot of factors at stake there and i tried to insinuate that even  then this relationship between vox machina and the now quelled conflict at the moment is still  tenuous theyve lost their leader and at that moment theres only two other individuals that  have taken any semblance of power and as opposed to just going into an allout well attack  everyone and everything theyre just feeling it out it seems i dont want to spoil anything  because im sure a lot of it will probably play out 
none	 in the next episode  yeah theres a lot of interesting facets beyond just them being people that roam and kill stuff  it should be interesting as it plays out things happen for reasons my narrative is far from  perfect im having to write on the fly a lot of the times and doing what i can with what free time  i have people are more than willing to go ahead and tear apart elements of it thats totally  viable but i try to do the best i can to have things make sense it anythings 
none	 confusing trust  that theres some reason as to why i did it whether or not you may agree with it thats  totally fine on you  anyway it was a fun episode and im proud of them the challenge level is still jumping as  things go and im curious to see how they deal with next week but yeah its crazy did scanlan  get an alignment change one act will not give you an alignment change depending on your  alignment however continued things towards that direction will begin to push in that nudge in  
none	 that way we shall see how that aspect will play into his characters personality going forward  which should be interesting stats for the items grog got ive gotten this question a lot today i  was going to see travis wanted to post them himself but i can probably post them up i know  the titanstone knuckles when attuned grant a strength of 24 much like a belt of giant  strength as well as allowing the user i think its once per long rest or short or long rest i  think its long rest to be 
none	 under the effect of the enlarge spell its not a spell its not  concentration but its the effect of an enlarge which is why kevdak was able to grow and it gives  them the siege ability which means he does double damage whoever has it does double damage against  objects and structures much like how an earth elementals physical attacks do so that is the  effect of that vestige its pretty fun its like an improved belt of giant strength a couple of  different fun things the bloodaxe is not a vestige its not an 
none	 artifact its just a powerful weapon  its a 2 greataxe that deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage against living creatures and so it  does not do additional damage to undead and creatures that arent considered living the other  thing is when it it brings the creature to zero it gives the wielder ten temporary hit points i  think those are the benefits to the bloodaxe so that should be fun on grog when he gets those on  are they fighting one of the dragons well see i have ideas on how i can handle the 
none	 whole tribe  fighting a dragon a lot of this is going to depend on the next episode because its not like  they all suddenly dove under the banner of zanror or grog the tribe is two different tribal  backgrounds that were tenuously under a tyrants rule essentially whether or not some agreed with  him or not they were all there for the point of survival and the advancement of their people now  that that has been taken its a very interesting social point in that tribes existence and i think  next episode will definitely 
none	 bring some of that to light so yeah should be fun  lets see if we can dig in a few more minutes of your questions then i got to jump on some stuff  i just wanted to hop on and say hi to folks did i see the superfight promo cards i did they did  not tell me they were doing that it was a cool surprise the fact that they have those made is a  weirder part of my reality im still adjusting to it its very strange cant the tribe build an  ultra 
none	 antidragon thing theyre not builders per se they dont have a whole lot of time but  we will see do i blame wil wheaton for my loss no i dont consider it a loss it was a fair  challenge there were three different moments where they almost lost party members last night  not like zero hit points like those barbarians wouldnt take a party member to zero and then walk  away they would continue to cut until there were just pieces left so yeah there were a few kind  of hairy moments where i wasnt 
none	 sure it was quite an intense evening definitely  do i enjoy druids i think druids are fantastic theyre vastly improved in this edition over the  fourth edition ive always loved druids i think its a cool character background cool spell set  and has unique variety to play style which i like a lot  do i think the dragon has a chance against 40plus barbarians well  theyre not all barbarians for one i say barbarians because its just  an easy term to say but they all have different strengths some of them are fighters  
none	 there are handful of druids a few other specialties we shall see a lot of people versus  breath weapon can be a real fast battle sometimes well see what they come up with im letting them  all figure it out am i in overwatch i am i voice jesse mccree actually the cowboy character  in overwatch im really excited that that games about to come out its a fun one as youre  playing it in beta now or getting it soon get used to hearing the horrible phrase of its high  noon it should be 
none	 fun laughs  um lets see  advice on getting into voice acting theres this great website that can  break down any answers i would have for you called iwanttobeavoiceactorcom its run by dee bradley  baker it has one of those comprehensive breakdowns of exactly the answers to the question  youre asking and way far better than i could so check that out definitely  if you would have two of your favorite bosses fight in the game who would it be oh two of  them fight each other oh man huh the kevdak and greenbeard 
none	 combo is actually a very nasty combo if  theyre not held at the same time greenbeards initial tactic actually was either he had a  number of heals to back up kevdak during that entire fight as well as the ability of he was  going to cast sunbeam and go earth elemental form he would then be an earth elemental shooting beams  out of his hands in a very iron man way that was going to be one of his aggressive tactics trying  to line up shots yeah there are a lot of things that scanlan 
none	 definitely was the mvp of that  battle at the very top if he hadnt they utilized the cutting words to lower the saving  throw on a kevdak against the hold person that would have been a whole different ball game with  both him and greenbeard locked down that pretty much wrecked things on their side from the getgo  it was intense  what did i think of sams shirt it was amazing he held onto that the entire day didnt show that  to anybody until he unveiled it on the stream and that was pretty 
none	 great did scanlan choose to hold  greenbeard at random possibly he just said the the guy with the green beard and i was like all  right cool i know people keep asking about why none of the goliaths were mentioning grogs beard  they havent been in a situation where its really been a concern for theirs yet i have a feeling  this is going to occur when they have a little less stressful environments to have discussions  osysa plus mate versus thordak who wins i think thordak would probably have that fight  probably yeah 
none	 probably hes a rough one am i surprised that grog killed greenbeard i wasnt  sure which way he was going to go that was very much the which path to the herd do you choose at  this moment you have two individuals that have some semblance of status within the remnants of  the herd and it seems that only one of these two you can choose to go with both can work towards  your goals it just depends on who you trust the path more and who you think the others can rally  behind zanrors 
none	 probably going to be a harder sell to the rest of the tribe than greenbeard  wouldve been just because hed been established for so long but like i said a lot of thats  going to play out in the next session im sure  is allura still in westruun last they saw via the scry she seemed to be radically propelling  her way via the travel spark i think it was out of the library there the cobalt reserve thats last they saw of  her well see am i planning on bringing in a blood hunter 
none	 pc if the story brings them to cross one  of the orders possibly they exist in the world they havent really been in a position where  theyve encountered any yet theyre still very minimal in presence marisha is actually off to a  shoot right now so shes not here for this one would kevdaks rage have fallen if they would  have waited around to attack him he would have actually if they would have kept him there his  rage would have fallen and he wouldve taken full damage after that round but i guess they 
none	 also  just wanted to try and burn him down as best they could they did a lot of damage to him but that  rage with the half reduction kept him going for a long time  how do i remember so much thats happened previous games i dont know i still forget a  lot im sure i have to go back and remind myself occasionally but you live in this world the way i  have some of the stuff sticks i guess i also might have a problem lets see ill do a few  more 
none	 of these questions and then i got to get some work done but i thought id pop in with you guys  for a minute lets see should grogs rage have kept up not while he was inside the raven  queens amulet that put him at a round with no attack or damage comparatively so the rage would  have dropped lets see  any surprises in last nights episode there were many surprises many tactical surprises by  the party many rolls and responses that surprised me the fact that they brought kevdak down so low  and 
none	 then went up to 70 points from the heal and then they brought him down just back to that 70  id already calculated looking at him he was on that tail end and that happened to be the final  blow was grog that was a big surprise and really swung things in their favor like i said if any  other pc had gotten killing blow on kevdak the battle wouldnt have paused they would have seen  that as an act of assassination and would have just kept attacking its pretty crazy lets see  been doing 
none	 the rpgs at momocon i mean i dont do a lot of ancillary rpgs because its hard to  organize and to be fair i spend most my time doing this one anyway i cant burn myself out  ill be doing panels and stuff probably on gaming critical role and things like that so if youre  coming to momocon in atlanta ill have panels regarding those topics  why no door involvement look taldorei look the doors have had their day and will have them  again it cant all be doors besides that would be unfair tpk 
none	 them instantly oh cool you got  loot crate because of us awesome yeah it was really cool of loot crate to reach out weve had  loot crate for a long time ourself we have a few friends that worked with them in the past and  theyre a really nice company i mean thanks to you guys were getting to the point now with the  show that we can have sponsors which is cool because that helps us out it means that we can  for me especially means that i can spend more time focusing on 
none	 the show because it makes a  little more on the side for me which is good and it means that we can provide a lot of special  discounts for our fans and we can help build the brand into something that we never expected it  would be were still holding on and seeing where this whole thing goes im blown away that the  show is what it is and that you guys are what you are so lifes weird right now its good its weird  what about matt colville i saw someone mention his name 
none	 there matt colville is an amazing person  and once again if you havent seen his videos on his tips for running games and world building  theyre fantastic and very well thoughtout and thorough hes an amazing writer and a really good  friend and because time and such has prevented me from being able to do as many or as indepth as  the gm tips episodes as ive been wanting to and i hope to do some more pretty soon hes been  helping fill that gap and do a far better job than i could have 
none	 so definitely check those out  have matt colville on the show theres been talk we have a long list of people that want to  be on the show and im being particular and careful i want to make sure that theyre people  that arent going on just for selfpromotion i want to make sure the people that are genuinely  interested or passionate about either learning to play or have played before and want to get on and  do fall somewhat in an entertainment realm that we do colville would be phenomenal on hes  definitely 
none	 in consideration on my list so dont worry  critical role stuff in loot crate that largely depends on the how well the sponsorship goes  thats part of the discussion if it does well and enough of the audience takes to it and they  find that theres a good overlap and that venn diagram of critters and loot craters i guess  im calling them now coined it then there has been talk maybe doing specific critical role stuff  down the line thats what im really excited about with this whole sponsorship is the  opportunities to 
none	 bring more of this world i made up to physical form its been the weirdest  experience in the world i cant even what do i think of the savage world system its great i  like it a lot especially deadlands ill keep pushing that one because its one of my favorite  rpg systems is my dad a bard totally and actually he made a bard the one game i tried to dm  for my parents he made a bard named him something fender because hes my dad musician  pop funko mercer someone sent me one 
none	 a custom one at critmas and its on my desk and its amazing  lets see what other questions here  any update on the fanzine yeah the fanzines interesting we were wanting to plan something  we were working on a way that we could bring the community and actually produce something  official through critical role that would include the community artists and hopefully do an occasional  recurring thing like that where youre bringing together partially into planning and the fanzine  announcement happened we were like oh how do we roll all this together so we 
none	 love the idea but  we figured it might be cooler if we could go ahead and work with them on a professional level to put  something together make it look really nice and put it on like the shop sale and actually make  some money for the artists who put all this time into it as well and have it be official i  probably shouldnt even been talking about this but whatever nda shushes surprises we have  ideas we have thoughts and were hoping to do something really cool with you guys with the  
none	 wonderful art community thats come out of this so hopefully in the near future well be able to  talk more about it you didnt hear anything here shushes  lets see have a little lag here im not getting any messages here take three more questions than  i got to run all right opinion on psionics i have a weird history with psionics psionics have  always been historically broken in a lot of ways in older editions i felt a lot of psychic powers  the way they were designed in the older like second edition days 
none	 were very out of genre for  me so i had a hard time enjoying them theyve gotten better over years and im waiting to see  what they do in fifth edition releases coming up its a cool facet i havent quite found an  implementation that im really happy with yet so well see as things happen  i will send regards to dagon im sure shell appreciate it by going clicking shes really  cute when shes really relaxed and she makes kissy sounds well wake up and shell crawl in bed with  us and well 
none	 go kissy sounds and shell turn to us and go kissy sounds well do that back and  forth for like five minutes its the cutest thing birds are awesome thoughts on 3dprinted  minis oh man i would love that maybe one day ill get a 3dprinter and ill put them out ive  seen some really cool stuff happen im all about like the idea 3dprinted terrain as well i think a  few critters who sent me some amazing things of that based on just toying with and playing and  expanding on the dwarven forge stuff 
none	 last night was like my grand magnum opus a cityscape i was  really happy how that turned out i hope it came across well on camera for you guys wasnt too  confusing but it could help elevate yeah im on this like terrain kick right now like how can i  do this lets see  okay kevdak took half the fire damage was that supposed to happen yes i answered that earlier  but ill say it again kevdak was not a berserker barbarian he is a totem of the bear barbarian  one of their abilities 
none	 is when theyre raging they halve all damage except for psychic thats  actually their benefit theyre more of a tanky barbarian to clarify for you guys  tips to encourage players to roleplay a bit more if youre running the game just engage  them as an npc look them in the eyes and talk to them as the npc would and if they begin to  describe what theyre doing we ask them well how do you say it go ahead and say it talk to me  about it as the character or even temporarily implement the 
none	 rule well whatever you say you  say in character if theyre really not comfortable with that then dont push them you  want to make sure people are playing on the level that theyre comfortable for but if you can nudge  them a little bit out of the comfort zone they may discover that they enjoy it more it may take  a little more work on your side as the dm to do so but yeah  any tips to calm an overconfident party throw something in their way they cant beat and teach  them that 
none	 sometimes you have to run you have to run laughs therere many ways to do it and if you  look online theres some cool options for that im going to take one more question and i got to  run and get some work done lets see look through here do i use index cards to plan out my  campaign i dont use index cards i print out spreadsheets that i make in microsoft excel and  cut them into smaller blocks that i then tape to paper so i use standardsized pages but i i  should 
none	 remember to take a page behind the screen one of these days im always such in the zone  when im set up and getting ready to go in the game because i have a lot of things i have to  prepare my brain and load up all the mental programs of what im about to run that i forget  to but ill see if i can do that some point in the near future  what do i think of 14yearolds like you playing dd thats when i started so i think its cool  be aware 
none	 some environments especially in those ages kids can be cruel but be prepared that be  sure of who you are have fun and if youre not having fun with one group maybe find another one  are we okay to send character sheets for you to use as an npc to put in perspective id say  just in the past critmas alone i received about 35 to 40 different player characters people were  sending me to use in the campaign ill reiterate i situation of favoritism so im going to try  to implement more possible contests 
none	 in which we can incorporate npcs for the winner and stuff like  that we did that once before and it worked out well so im hoping to do stuff like that in the  future but i cant ensure that because it is a weird slippery slope but yeah  all right i know i said one more before and then i did three more sorry do i feel physically  this will be the last one do i feel physically drained at the end of a session yes its a very  mentally and physically taxing experience running 
none	 that game its intense so i usually sleep well  the night after dont sleep well the night before sleep well the night after i try not to  schedule something too early friday morning but inevitably it happens like this morning i had a  900am session and i didnt get to bed until about about 300 so i got about four and a half hours  of sleep last night total so that was fun anyway guys ive got to get going much love i  hope you all have a wonderful day thank you for listening to
