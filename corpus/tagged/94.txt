none	 critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back ladies and gentlemen  sam a lot happened a lot happened in that break  matt apparently i missed most of it  laura pure chaos  matt im so removed from most events at the table before the game starts im like what  happened what  taliesin do you phase out so you dont hear the terrible things we say  matt no im focused on the rest of the shit thats happening tonight anyway so to get you  up to speed our fantastic band of adventurers vox 
none	 machina had been battling against the chroma  conclave a collection of evil dangerous chromatic dragons led by thordak the cinder  king who has been reigning over their home city of emon for quite some time terrorising the  community and apparently slowly undergoing a change based on the elemental stone that is  embedded in his body that once locked him into the plane of fire youve defeated most of the  dragons and allied yourself with one of the only remaining members raishan the green dragon you  guys have since acquired a number of allies you 
none	 made your way to the fire plane to the city of  brass you returned to find fort daxio under attack you managed to defend it you saved a few  friends returned to whitestone and it seems like everything is gearing itself towards the final  conflict in emon with thordak the cinder king last we left off you were meeting underneath  whitestone at the ziggurat with the current standing council the war council of both  whitestone and this entire endeavor you decided a couple of people to come with you and now is your  time 
none	 to spend the next day or so wisely as the army from fort daxio and syngorn will be arriving  at emon by about sundown the following day your airship was in transit to daxio and has been  rerouted to emon as well everyone is converging to the city what do you want to do to prepare  laura oh god its all happening  marisha okay theyre all going to the city  laura so what time of day is it right now  matt right now id say about midafternoon  marisha are we still down by 
none	 the ziggurat  matt yeah you guys just finished your meeting at the ziggurat  taliesin i have some guns to repair because everything broke and many of these things cost  money now  matt yeah  sam thats small picture were big picture  liam how long is the trip did we say to get to emon from here  sam instant for us  laura well we have to go through a tree  sam or a teleportation circle  liam then were meeting with dad  laura yeah hes marching to emon right now  marisha 
none	 are we going to have a meeting spot outside of emon we should probably have a plan  taliesin we should probably get close to greyskull and see if we can enter through the  tunnels  liam i think thats our way yeah  sam yes but we do have to rally with your pops and also didnt we cut loose 55 soldiers to wander  free in the desert from daxio  laura theyre meeting the other armies  sam theyre just going to form up  laura trust in them theyre soldiers theyll be able to find 
none	 their way  sam right but can we scry and figure out where this other army is maybe well go there or maybe  we should scry on our old keep and go there those seem like two good locations  taliesin i think scrying on the old keep and then letting everyone know we dont necessarily want  everyone arriving at the same place as well as long as theres a coordinated movement towards the city  laura they can all start attacking and we can come in from the bottom  sam sure but weve told the approaching 
none	 army nothing about any plan whatsoever  taliesin we can call them if we need to  marisha so we probably want different regiments flanking the city in different areas  taliesin and then maybe the 50 men coming into the sewers to fight  liam i feel like we want to catch up with our fathers army before theyre anywhere near the  walls of the city because well thatd be stupid  taliesin we can go meet them if thats the next move  sam and strategize when we get there once we see their forces and what 
none	 they have to offer  marisha percy do you still have that map of emon  taliesin yes somewhere  laura we should probably talk to gilmore as well and let him know that he has to fucking join us  marisha that he drew the short straw we drew the short straw for him  taliesin we should also collect some other allies if were going to head in this direction  laura of course  sam all right do you want to go talk to gilmore vaxypoo  taliesin were going to need a painter you know a 
none	 painter we should bring a painter with us  sam a painter to paint our exploits  taliesin yes to paint our exploits you have that portrait  marisha once again percy i feel like thats small picture  taliesin is it small potatoes is it really though  liam we could find a jeweller right now if thats what youre into  sam i have a man at a casino that i really need to get revenge on  taliesin you might as well get it all done now because youre not going to be able to do it 
none	 later  marisha 24 hours left alive  liam kynan kynan  sam all right  taliesin but no stock up on what again whitestone doesnt necessarily have a lot for us  to gather  sam but we should bring any potions how we doing on potions did you ever divvy up our last several  potions  laura i did divvy up our last potions i feel like it might be smart to get some more but the  only place to really buy any is vasselheim  sam is that true  laura i mean its the 
none	 only city still standing that we have access to immediately we dont have  a lot of time the thing is i feel like people in vasselheim said they would help us but i dont  know how theyd get to emon to help us in time  sam i know an airship oh shit wheres our airship  laura its on its way  sam to where  liam emon to emon  sam did we say emon or did we say daxio  matt it was on its way to daxio  marisha theyre redirecting to emon  
none	 sam thank god were sending it to a dragon instead of a fort on fire  taliesin it does have weaponry  laura yeah its made to take on things attacking it  taliesin its designed to help keep him on the ground  marisha uhhuh yeah its a giant balloon in the air  laura its not a balloon actually  taliesin well no its a giant crystal its i know i keep saying  marisha i always think of it as a hightech hindenberg  taliesin i know please dont say that thats not funny  liam thats 
none	 a metaphor for vox machina  matt there you go if there ever was one yeah  sam all right besides gathering our forces here gathering our potions here and telling gilmore  where are we going lets put it to a vote as we always do democratically grog  matt yes  sam grog where would you like to go to the army waiting just outside of emon or to our old ratty  keep with nothing in it  taliesin id like to go to the i dont know  laura i dont know what he wants  
none	 matt percys getting a little strange off to the side  laura wait travis is watching so he can just text in yeah grog is thinking about it grog is  thinking really hard  matt he considers it for a second and goes whatever makes me kill things faster  laura thats good  marisha wait have we rested  matt you did rest before coming here you spent the evening in fort daxio  marisha and then we teleported no allura brought us here  sam okay putting it to a vote three choices ready to your dad 
none	 to our keep or to vasselheim  i dont know why but its been mentioned  marisha hang on i can scry on our keep  laura cant allura send a message to them and let them know what our plan is and then we dont have  to actually bamf there  sam we dont have a plan  taliesin wherever we go we can let everyone know what the plan and where were going is  laura i feel like what we need to do okay heres what i think our plan should be  sam lead us 
none	 o mighty vex  laura i feel like we should tell the armies gathering to prepare to attack we enter in where  the clasp is we come in from the bottom up  sam so theyre going to create a diversion for us  laura exactly they take on the armies while we head straight to thordak  liam dad creates a shitstorm at the wall and we take advantage of that chaos  sam we have to communicate this to them  taliesin easy to do we just send a message  laura we could send a message 
none	 or we could bamf there and then bamf another place it seems a lot  of time wasted  taliesin yeah easier just to send a message  matt allura has been in communication and has been the information hub between most of these  individuals  liam how long did we say before syldor reaches emon  matt by about dusk the following day  liam dusk the following day and you said afternoon right now so a little more than 24 hours  taliesin we can at least get into there and start communicating with the clasp  
none	 marisha were not really in good standing with them  taliesin im sure theyll be happy to see us regardless  marisha you think i guess sure its like seeing that person you hated in high school after  something terrible just happened happy for the familiarity  sam but now theyre a little bit overweight and they work in an applebees  marisha sure and its a little gratifying  sam yeah  liam they can hate us and we can deal with that afterward if there is even an afterward  taliesin theyre businessmen i doubt they hold 
none	 grudges  laura im sure they hold grudges  taliesin not until after the dragons been taken care of  laura then theyll make us pay  taliesin yes its not profitable to kill us before the dragon is dead  liam also somewhere in all this fracas we need you to take care of us with food  taliesin when its time  liam right when is the time  taliesin i think once were there  marisha it lasts for 24 hours  laura before we head in  liam in the keep for old times sake  
none	 laura i dont think thats very smart  taliesin or in the sewers for old times sake  laughter  liam i mean underneath  taliesin hopefully in the keep  sam so we have a clear plan then  taliesin we have a plan for dinner  liam theres no guarantees scanlan  sam where are we going thats all i care about right now  liam were going to hell where do you think were going its going to be fucking awful  youre probably going to be dead in 48 hours  sam yeah but well be 
none	 together and i dont think that ill die  liam youre adorable  taliesin youre going to be in front if anything  marisha this is the worst of two extremes  taliesin you should scry on greyskull  marisha is anyone still there  sam last time i looked in there was some movement or it looked like people had recently  been there  marisha wasnt it drexel dranzel  sam nope theyre off somewhere else  laura you said by sunset tomorrow is when theyll be at emon  matt thats when theyll be there and ready 
none	  laura okay  matt if you want more information you might have to talk to somebody who has that information  laura right what we need to do is plan a time that they start the attack  sam sure weve got to get there first and suss it out too we havent done any recon this army  of your fathers we have no idea how big it is if they have archers if they have an elite swat  team task force  taliesin how do you feel that will affect our plan  sam if we 
none	 know we have an elite swat team task force we can take them down with us into the  sewers  taliesin i can almost promise you they do not have an elite swat team task force  laura they might have some stealthy  taliesin some stealthy individuals  marisha we have friends of our own  sam also if we do any recon we might know that oh theres a big thing we need to have taken out  before we can even get in what if our keep is being surrounded  marisha okay hang on let 
none	 me scry on the keep this will answer plenty of questions and then  well go from there  laura scry away keyleth  marisha did we leave laina there did we leave anyone there or is it completely vacated  liam it was chaos when we left  matt yeah it was absolute chaos you pushed your servants through your staff still currently  exists somewhere in whitestone  marisha i cant scry on a building correct  matt correct  liam we fought vorugal and then hightailed it out of there inside and gone  marisha i cant 
none	 scry on a building  taliesin can you scry on a plant  sam can you scry on a dead thing  marisha can i scry on a plant  taliesin there is a tree  matt because you are a druid being a naturebased entity and it is a living  creature  laughter  matt dont steal my thunder  marisha one that ive had personal communications with  matt i would say due to the fact that you are a druid and nature is your basis if it is a  specific plantbased entity that you are 
none	 very familiar with sure  sam do we have anything like that at our keep  matt you have a number of trees in the front you have the garden that you built in sarenraes  temple  marisha thats what i want to scry on i want to start there  matt okay  marisha you know how its always you zoom in really fast and you zoom in really fast can i  slow down  matt it doesnt work that way  marisha i cant pull focus  matt in theory scrying is only supposed to show 
none	 you whats there i narratively let a little bit  of a journey happen you cant control the journey sorry  sam dvr it  marisha its the worst okay  matt all right so where are you doing the spell  marisha where  matt where are you doing your scry ritual  marisha not near the ziggurat if were still there  matt right so are you guys heading back to the castle then  laura yeah lets go to the castle  matt while you guys are heading back to the castle from underneath the tunnels you 
dung	 are  briefly headed off by a familiar dwarven fellow in robes and a crystalline staff elementalist drake  thunderbrand by the way before you leave weve been working on a few things for you they should  be of assistance to you come find me in the common room whenever youre ready  sam yeah sure wow fortuitous  marisha i like presents  matt you head to your quarters to do the scry spell okay your vision clarifies on dark clouds  your vision sees a gathering of grayish mists and you slowly transition through them to see 
town	 shapes  that are either extremely small or extremely distant your vision begins to funnel through it  quickly like youre passing over the edge of a waterfall  theres a rush and you see as the clouds dissipate a glimpse of the overhead of emon you  see the oncegleaming city of white across the bladeshimmer shoreline pockmarked with black and  tall towers of curling black smoke you see flames that still burn unfettered unstopped throughout  the town and what looks from the distance like small clouds of gnats or flies that you realize  are much 
none	 larger flying entities doing small passes over various neighborhoods to keep watch or find food  your vision jumps again this time careening down even faster below you can see from an overhead  view greyskull keep you begin to rush in that direction and as it gets closer you can see the  same damage it took from the wall from the initial attack of the conclave you see elements of rubble  around the outside though its still pristine being repaired by the celestial entity that was  summoned by pike shortly after  your vision jumps again 
none	 this time through the repaired stainedglass exterior of the temple of  sarenrae and it comes to rest there in a moment amongst the strangely contrasting peaceful  greenery of this temple theres such a sense of hopelessness and horror on the outside of the  city this one little moment of time here is almost like a time capsule of how things were  before its sad but hopeful at the same time  as your vision swivels over to the tree there in the temple while contained here for as long as  its been it seems to 
none	 be healthy looking in the vicinity most everything seems in place  marisha do the trees look overgrown do the plants look overgrown  matt as much as being away for the handful of months that you have been they look like they  havent been trimmed or tended to recently  marisha and the temple is intact it looks like the keep is still intact from where we rebuilt it  matt correct it has not fallen  marisha do i sense any movement  matt make a perception check with disadvantage through your scry spell  taliesin no 
none	 i cant help yeah no  marisha i rolled two ones both ones ill say thats just flushing it out  matt strangely somehow through a scry spell something got in your eye in the temple  marisha i hate it when the vr goggles short out  laughter  matt you dont know if its divine energy interference or what but it stings a lot and you  feel the essence of the spell begin to shiver and quake and as you try and clear your vision  through it remains blurred  marisha shit  matt youre still 
none	 there your presence is there but you dont have the capability of seeing  anything beyond the tree youre focused on the scry spell is focused on the tree and everything  around it has this hazy fogofwar feel about five feet beyond it  sam good scry  marisha good scry guys good scry  laura what did you see anything good are we safe  marisha its still standing for the most part i saw pikes wait her celestial being wasnt  still there  matt no it was temporarily summoned for the reconstruction of the ceiling portion 
none	  marisha looks okay looks like home  liam still standing there wasnt anybody around it  marisha i couldnt tell  sam hows my comic book collection is it still there  marisha burned  taliesin mint in box  liam thats as close to a guarantee as were going to get  marisha i told you to get a fire box  laura do you think drake would join us  sam who little guy id like to be the shortest on this trip please  laura got it  liam you are  sam oh  marisha

none	 a big pickmeup to see him  laughter  liam solid you do that  taliesin im going to talk to cassandra about one last dip into the vaults to see if theres any  potions we know we have to leave them with something in case everything goes wrong but  anything we can take with us will be helpful and then i have to fix this giant mess of parts that  are currently in my bag i may need to spend a little money i do apologize  laura darling  taliesin okay just letting you know

none	 here in whitestone within the pale guard theres  really only three people that he hangs with one of thems kashaw one of thems a guy who you  never remember the name of whos fun thats the guy youre going to go bother you go and talk to  him for a bit and he points to one of the few currently functioning nondestroyed taverns in  whitestone there you find him sitting there drinking alone not heavy drinking in his cups  but staring off at the wall and sipping a midday ale  sam friend jarett  
none	 matt ah it is good to see you alive and right hi  sam just coming to check on my main man jmoney its j right  matt it is yes otherwise it would be garett  sam youre right  matt im good im a little nervous to be honest i like to shoot things from a wall i  dont like to go through a wall to shoot things and thats been happening a lot recently and from  what ive been hearing tomorrow is looking to be a very big day  sam well its going to 
none	 be quite a fight can we count on you to come with us perhaps  matt id assume that would be the case i would not want to have all of you disappear into  darkness and fire without me yelling behind you dont die i figure thats the very least i  could offer for this circumstance  sam we would be honored to have you with us and as you are still technically our employee  therell be a bonus for you at the end of it  matt another bonus  sam oh yes i wasnt aware 
tavern	 there was a yes two bonuses  matt oh yeah there was like four bonuses  sam you deserve all of them  matt damn right  sam the other thing that we had talked about did that ever come to fruition  matt no it was unfortunate you see my sister is engaged recently and he stands up and walks  out of the tavern putting a coin down on the front of the bar no worries ill find you  another lady and he walks outside  sam oh oh were speaking in code okay yes i need 
tavern	 a lady so bad and you were going to find me  a date  matt youre so much better at this when other people are involved why are you so bad when its me  laughter  matt he goes outside and guides you into a shaded portion of a nearby alley and leans against the  wall waiting for you to follow in  sam so is she a brunette  matt were out of the tavern  sam okay i dont know how long to keep the cover going  matt its fine look it is very 
none	 difficult to find anything right now the way things have been  but i did manage to scavenge a little bit of suude  sam suude  matt yes and he pulls out a small brown pouch maybe about the size of a d20 really like a  little nugget there and its tied tightly and he pockets real fast now dont ask me again to do this  sam wait are you a cop you have to tell me if youre a cop are you a cop  matt no  sam okay good  taliesin thats a myth

none	 you very much and im cool and all but do you put it up  your butt or snort it or do you burn it somehow or wrap it in something or eat it im pretty  cool but  laughter  offscreen ha  laughter  matt he leans in really close one eye halfsquinted going i will never understand  you scanlan shorthalt youre a smart boy how do you think you use it  sam in a pipe of some sort  matt sure and he walks out of the alleyway really embarrassed that he even did 
tavern	 this the  minute you said that he was like oh no i just bought beer for a 12yearold hes like ooh  taliesin id like to think that ha was passing that guy coming out of the pub and getting a  second  sam all right when you get her number call me or whatever so well meet her later  matt he walks away and puts his hand up with a and keeps walking you can almost see the hanging  head shake as he continues back towards where he was in the tavern  sam that 
none	 went well  taliesin that went very well  sam i got that  taliesin you did that  sam i did it  matt laughs mark down one small pocket satchel of suude suude  liam thats for after the dragon  laura its his own drugs hes made his own drugs up  taliesin here you go right there  mary he made drugs  laura well matt made drugs  taliesin put a glove on if youre going to get high if you hold it for too long  matt there is a society out there people 
none	 are going to continue to find ways to smoke swallow  or inhale substances  will definitely not a cop  matt definitely not  will definitely not a cop  mary sometimes you ride the dragon before you kill it  will laughs exactly  taliesin got to ride the dragon before you ride the dragon  marisha thats right  mary youve got to ride the dragon before you kill it  will thats right  mary its going to be great to watch scanlan take drugs  laughter  matt how do you think herbalists of previous 
none	 generations found out which plants are poisonous  huh thats bad  laughter  matt its culture man all right percy we need to make some checks for you  taliesin actually do i have to check even if im spending money  matt youre spending money to fix it but  laura how much money are you spending  taliesin how much do we have sorry ill stop  laura you tell me what you need  taliesin well find out  marisha youre the prince of whitestone cant you tap some taxes or something  matt you could 
none	 actually  taliesin i really try not to do that thats a dick move people are already iffy on these  things i imagine  liam spend everything right now  taliesin wow that made five decisions and landed on a really good one thats 28  matt okay yeah this is for bad news  taliesin yeah bad news is the only one that is broken the rest survived  matt yeah thats fine for bad news the original cost i have here sorry have to pull  up the pdf to remind me so i get it right 
none	  liam two electrum  matt laughs id put it about at maybe 500 gold worth of materials  taliesin oh okay feel better about that  matt its not a magical implement  but it is expensive  taliesin it is its got a lot of moving parts and then im going to go and talk to cassandra  quickly  matt all right as you make your way to try and find cassandra she is actually currently in her  room talking with allura talking with gilmore with brom and drake theres guards rushing in and  out 
none	 theres a general sense of ramping energy as everyone is gathering everything they have at  their disposal in preparation for whats going to happen tomorrow  mary wheres raishan  matt laughs you can go look for raishan if you like  mary no i just wanted to know  matt you dont know where raishan is right now as you enter the room over in the corner  midconversation cassandra is currently rolling up some papers and handing them to a guard turns  and finishes a quick bit of conversation whispering off to the side with drake 
none	 turns  around and her eyes meet you and she goes brother  taliesin my lady  matt yes what can i do to help you  taliesin were preparing to leave we are preparing to have a small strike force go  underneath the city and do what we can while the other armies hopefully distract thin the forces and  give us a shot at taking care of this once and for all  matt right  taliesin is there anything left in the vaults potionwise especially healing potions we dont  want to drain you obviously but 
none	 i thought i would make one last push  matt weve provided what we can drake and a few of our helpful supporters here in the city have  been providing for this purpose its not much but we do have and she snaps her fingers and  points to drake  you see hes currently putting together a big leather package oh no worry and he lifts it up on  the table you hear the clanking of glass around on the inside of the satchel he pulls it down a  little bit over the front pushes to 
none	 the side and you can see there are two cushioned racks that  contain various sizes of vials all right weve got three greater healing potions one basic  healing potion thats as much as we can find to be honest right now there hasnt been a lot of  trade and our supplys been limited and most of what we had has been used by you or folks here in  defense of the city  laura you said one basic  matt one basic yeah regular healing potion however ive spent my time knowing whats  coming and 
none	 being a focuser of the elemental arts brewing a few helpful bits here i wish i had more  time but our timeline has been a bit accelerated  he pulls out the second cushioned grouping here the vials are different shapes it seems  like the glass has been scavenged from what was available but the coloration is similar and you  recognize these youve had these before these are four potions of fire resistance  sam thats huge  laura thats great  marisha thats massive  taliesin we will be grateful for you till the end of 
none	 our days  matt oh i count on it  taliesin it may only be a day but you will have it  laughter  matt just remembered for these in particular they dont last a terribly long time one hour  make sure you dont drink it too soon  taliesin one hour will be all that is necessary  matt i certainly hope so so thats what i am able to provide for this ill be there helping  with some of the distraction so well figure out some of the details for the specific attack but  
none	 were pulling all that we can for this and well figure out whos going where whos attacking when  and in what way i guess if not tonight tomorrow and he looks over to cassandra and  nods im going to go pray he leaves the room  laura can i ask a question  matt yes  laura with potions do they stack can you take multiple ones and get multiple benefits or is it  like you take one potion and thats the one potion you get to take  matt i mean if theyre different types of 
none	 potions id say they could stack to a certain  degree if you just begin to chug four potions in a row i might be asking for some constitution  saving throws  taliesin or like a mixed drink that can get weird right  matt yeah things might not  mary long island ice tea of death  matt yeah exactly some effects might not mingle well or the urge from your body might reject that  much ingestion of enchanted fluid  laura okay cool just checking  marisha dont mix your darks with your clears pick one 
none	  matt dont eat the giant toenail at the bottom of the bottle  taliesin water breathing before fire never been higher  laughter  taliesin exactly i think that was the yeah  sam true  matt anything else  taliesin id like to just grab cassandra really quickly and take her aside  matt okay yes brother  taliesin i will only take one moment of your time ive not had a moment to repay you for my  part in all of this yet and if we survive i owe you much and if i dont seal 
none	 off the city there  is room underneath prepare for siege prepare to be a safe haven do not be do what you can to  save the city do not get involved in the aftermath of this if we fail  matt thats actually what im discussing with allura and the reason shes staying back is to  help us continue should such an occasion arise but i am confident knowing what youre capable  of that we worry for naught were doing our best here and i know you are doing your best there  just come back 
none	 to me  taliesin i will do my best weve for centuries you must know we have survived as  realists and it is very hot down there and i do not like it good luck see you soon  matt i need you return  taliesin i shall and i go pack  matt okay as you leave vax crosses you in the doorway as gilmore is in midconversation right  now with well it was with drake and then when hed had the conversation he watched and drake  left and so he was on his way out 
none	 following percival and you caught him  liam can i steal you for a second  matt certainly  liam over here  matt all right  liam hi again  matt hi  liam remember how we just saw each other a couple of days ago and i tried to say goodbye and you  told me to promise you that i would see you again  matt yes and much to my delight youve kept your promise and you better keep keeping it  liam you know what would help with that boy have i got an offer 
none	 for you you want to help us  save the world my family and i were going to him and i wasnt sure the path that would take us  there i thought we might be on our own but were back here and you are easily the most impressive  arcane user ive ever met in my life and i want us all to still be breathing in a week i cant  think of anyone better to stand with us than you shaun  matt his eyes look off for a minute and he reaches up and rubs 
none	 the back of his neck and you  can see theres still a scar there he goes if im to be honest ive felt a bit useless here in  whitestone for quite some time i was there when this all began it destroyed not just the thing  ive been working to build for so long of my life but friends home for all of us so it is my just  honor and vengeful glee to join you on the siege to emon if you will have me  liam i grasp him by the back of the 
none	 head gesundheit im so glad to have you with us  friend so glad  matt just stay alive keep that promise  liam it will be a little bit easier now  matt good and he smacks you on the cheek  liam good time for a musical quote  all singing stay alive  matt he smacks you on the cheek and goes learned that from you all right then i guess  ive got to gather my supplies and oh its been a while since ive seen some ive never  actually seen combat on this scale 
none	 before when you know i wasnt just trying to run away so  lets see if i can knock off the old dust  liam im sure it will be glorious  matt oh i can guarantee it  marisha plug  matt all right  liam lets do it  laura im wondering if we should eat a heroes feast tonight and then just eat one again  tomorrow cause we just dont know whats going to happen during the day anymore just a heroes  feast every night be ready and just you know  sam yep do 
none	 we have the money for that  laura its yeah were fine  sam all right  taliesin i was looking forward to a heroes brunch personally  laura either one  sam bagels and lox  matt heroes high tea  mary eggs benedict with lots of extra hollandaise  taliesin capers of might  matt what else do you guys wish to prepare if anything  liam holy shit man  laura we have our potions should we split them up  sam who needs fire giant i mean fire resistance the most  laura okay we have 
none	 five potions of fire resistance  sam we do  laura yes because we already had one now we have two superior five regular healing and three  greater what we also have is a potion of invulnerability which is clutch and a potion of  speed we need to decide who to give the potion of invulnerability to because it lasts for ten  minutes  matt no one minute im pretty sure ill check but thats a powerfulass potion  laura you cant die right when you take it  matt you wish  laura i mean can 
none	 you take damage when youve got it going its like a minute of no damage  matt you take damage you have resistance to all damage so all damage you take is halved  mary should that be decided midbattle clutch  sam that one seems like a specific task  laura thats a specific task kind of thing so well decide that later  taliesin there is an item and im currently holding it and i dont know if im the best  person to be holding this but im just going to pass this down the line to 
none	 see if anyone has an  opinion  marisha its the sword  liam this is too bad i cant wield this fucker  laura i cant wield a sword either  taliesin its a dexbased sword correct  matt the sword of dragonslaying  taliesin yeah or it can switch  matt im allowing it to switch if need be  taliesin so it can be strength or dexbased maybe this is the thing to hand to grog and one  minute of invulnerability with that is possibly the cruellest thing that dragon will have ever  experienced  
none	 laura the thing is if hes raging i dont know if hell think to switch over  taliesin well its an attuned weapon  matt he isnt resistant to fire while hes raging  marisha no but he has resistance to physical damage and if he takes a potion of fire  resistance is he pretty much covered the same way if hes raging and has a fire potion  matt possibly  liam i could use this because its dexbased if i so choose  laura but you cant do three attacks with it because its bigger  matt 
none	 well yeah you would have one attack with that  liam one attack but not i cant do longsword and then a dagger  matt you could do longsword and then a bonus  laura thats pretty cool  matt let me check i dont know if he can do them all  laura could he do whisper and then attack with the dragon sword  taliesin i dont know how many items you have attuned at the moment  will just two i believe  taliesin so you could go for a triple  will i could well i 
none	 have my shadow spear but my nec so youd want the nec damage from that is  what youd be looking for i dont know if i could wield the two of them together  taliesin its a onehanded sword so im not sure what is your  matt it has to be a light melee weapon in both hands it looks to do this unless you have a feat  to fix that  taliesin which i do  matt you have the do you have dual wielder as a feat  liam yes  matt yeah so yes 
none	 you can use the longsword and whisper in the other hand  liam but its attunement so i have to choose something  matt youd have to chose that over  liam this would supersede whisper yeah  laura what whisper is a vestige  liam i understand that but this is very strong and with wings i could go anywhere  matt do note as part of the rogue ability im just doublechecking here but im pretty sure  the attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon technically im allowing actually no im  allowing it to 
none	 be a finesse  liam youre allowing it youre allowing it  matt well because its strength or dex im sticking to my choice  liam okay so its light  matt its not light its finesse meaning you can choose strength or dexterity  mary i have a question last time i saw you you were looking for the vestiges  laura yes  mary did you find them  laura all of them all of them well all of them that we know about  mary do you know what to do with them  sam they are 
none	 all super powerful and are awesome and youll see them in battle tomorrow  laura thats all we know is that you fight with them thats all we know why do you know more  mary is there any information we can glean from osysa at all in vasselheim of how to use them  laura well it would mean traveling to vasselheim  mary thats true is there any way to get there just quick and bamf in and just  taliesin last time we went somewhere quick and bamfed in  mary it was a long time  
none	 taliesin things went poorly but we could speak to her we could talk to her  laura one of us could go and bamf back and be back tomorrow morning  will well you said you used them  marisha yeah weve been using them  will so then you know what they do for the most part right  all yeah  will why waste a trip  mary what if theres a way to combine them  marisha we tried we put them all in a pile  laughter  will that didnt work piling them on top 
none	 of each other didnt work  sam they didnt become a robot  laura not as much as we hoped it would no  marisha yeah there are other vestiges too that are out there  liam you have a potion of haste yeah  laura yeah potion of speed  liam what if you gave me that and i gave you my boots  sam real quick who needs the fire protection  mary i dont im resistant  marisha if we have plenty of potions ill take it so i dont have to use a concentration spell  
none	 taliesin ditto my plan is to stay away from the fire but if i cant that would certainly help  will my plate is partially fire resistant  sam vex you dont need it  laura fire resistance  sam didnt i give you that oh i gave you cold resistance  laura yeah i need fire resistance  sam what did you give me  mary chlamydia  sam acid resistance  laura oh yeah thats right  mary sorry i was just in australia i got it from a koala im kidding  laura i could take off 
none	 my bracers  liam its up to you i dont want to  marisha theres also the discussion  sam what more discussions  liam you take the boots im on the potion i have whisper and this sword  marisha are we going to try and lure thordak out of his lair as a challenger  sam no were going to sneak into his lair right  will youre going to corner it  taliesin hes not going to leave his lair anymore he knows were coming  mary so just very briefly what is the plan  sam 
town	 the plan as i understated it is we send a vicious army to attack at the gates all over the  place drawing out thordaks forces in an epic battle blood sinew and gore everywhere while  we slip under the city unbeknownst to thordak in the tunnels with the clasp leading us leading us  right to the center of town where we pop up and surprise thordak he didnt know we were coming  he thought that there was an army at the gates and we stab him real quick and leave  laura done and we also 
none	 find whatever it is hes protecting and kill that too  sam and at some point raishan comes and helps us  laura hey whats up  will how you doing  laura im really sorry about all of that  will no its no problem its great  mary i have a question do i know about the machine have i been told about that did raishan  tell me about that  matt which one  mary the machine that thordak is building or whatever the heck hes  matt thordak as far as you know has let 
none	 nobody down there raishan included and you have no idea  what machinations thordak is  mary but i do know about it  matt i mean you know as much as they do its come up in conversation previously yes  will and you said were going into the tunnels does anyone know the way through the tunnels  sam the clasp does theyre an order of rogues and thieves who hate us but theyre going to help us  mary do you trust them  sam we totally trust them because they are scoundrels and liars and we 
none	 have no other choice  taliesin it doesnt serve them to lie to us  mary this sounds like a wonderful plan  will it doesnt serve the scoundrels and liars to lie and be scoundrels  taliesin it doesnt serve them in this moment no you know if youre always a liar and a  scoundrel then no one will ever trust you to do anything theyre only conveniently liars and  scoundrels  will i love this plan this is great  sam laughs its pretty airtight  will yeah i dont see any room for problems so 
none	 you want to go in and corner the dragon where he  lives and is most powerful  sam yes yes  will his back to the wall and no escape  sam he can escape at any moment he can fly  will just us though not the entire army which we are using as a diversion  sam just a partial group yes  will but the scoundrels are going to lead us to him  taliesin well he has his own army  will of course  taliesin so we need to keep his army distracted so 
none	 were not fighting a dragon and an army so  those armies will hopefully either distract the armies or if he chooses not to send the armies to  fight the rest of the armies that weve brought all of our armies also converge on the dragons  nest and then we have everybody there  will youre engaging all of your forces in one play if he holds his forces back why not send in  skirmishes to see what happens first  laura oh i like this plan hes good  taliesin no we have people that we 
none	 can do for that although its not just one army we have we  have groups of them technically i was just  will attacking in one place  taliesin oh no all around the city  will is there a weak point  sam our plan  laughter  taliesin dont you laugh no no you dont get to laugh that scares us sadly the only weak  point is  liam we either go with the shitty hand weve been given or we lie down and let him steamroll over us  marisha yes but we can also 
none	 try and formulate at least a vague plan so that we all dont die  within a single  taliesin i think this is a vague plan so that we dont all die  marisha all right okay lets build off of what kash has  taliesin if its too specific then its going to go wrong too quickly  marisha hang on hang on hes right  mary plus we dont know what to expect we have to be ready for anything  will we feint the city send skirmishes in to feint the city so they dont know 
none	 where the main  attack is coming from theyll have to defend every wall what you then do what you want them  doing because theyre defending the wall they wont know when the serious attack is coming from  then you send them towards one fortified position that would draw everybody to the one fortified  position but thats also a feint and you come in the backdoor thats always the way you do it  meanwhile well take the scoundrels and liars and hopefully theyre going to take us to corner  the giant thing that wants to 
none	 kill all of us in the place where he is the most powerful  laura yeah that one  taliesin im actually very okay with this plan  sam we should have him with us always  laughter  mary i totally agree  laura do it lets do that lets do that  will lets do that okay great plan oh my god whos in charge whos leading your ground forces  sam we have no leader except we do have a secret weapon we have a dragon who definitely wants  something that we dont know about who 
none	 might or might not be working with us  laura we also have another secret weapon  marisha we have two dragons  sam we have a sword that is a dragonslaying sword  liam and marisha a whole other dragon  will we should just kill each other now and just save the trouble we got to plan something  laura scanlan you do remember the flute right  sam yeah i carry it with me always i use it all the time  laura i wonder how long itll take to bamf over when we play the flute 
none	 is it instantaneous  or is it like it takes a day  sam well never know  laura well find out  laughter  sam ill be dead long before it works  taliesin six months later where is everybody  laughter  marisha i told you we were going to die if we didnt have you  will no youre going to die even with me but im going to be the guy going hey we could have  planned this better  marisha right yeah  mary i think youve given them a really good plan  
none	 laura yeah no thats great lets do that  taliesin there is no situation that anyone is going to come up with where were looking good  and this is going to work well theres just theres a dragon in the middle of the city with an  evil army and we have to deal with it and theres just no positive way to deal with that  mary are we taking raishan with us  sam raishan i feel like shes going to meet us there  marisha it just seems so highly defeatist to already plan for you 
none	 know defeat  taliesin its not planning for defeat its recognizing that no matter what ten minutes into  it everything that we thought we knew is going to be wrong anyway  will at least tell me youre not going to send all your forces in at the same time youre  saving a reserve  laura of course  marisha okay then we need to talk about the forces that are going in more armies are talented  than others  sam were not sending them all in  taliesin no were not we are going to surround 
none	 the city  will i need one supreme general whos going to be in charge of everything who stays back as were  attacking  laura daxio is going to do that  mary all right  will and the men trust him  laura yes hes the leader of the army  will okay  taliesin hes all right  marisha then we need to get this plan to him  laura yeah we need to talk to him  taliesin we have communications  marisha so were going to have waves of assault from one position have other 
none	 people flank in from  another position  will and youre attacking a fortified city  taliesin fortifiedish well the hope is actually also we have the 50 men from fort  daxio we can bring them in underground as well and just have them pop up  laura and open the gates  taliesin all sorts of places also open the gates  will so you could bring forces with us to come up in the middle of the city  laura yeah  will thats good we should have talked about that in the beginning  sam i 
none	 also think theres a swat team thats available to us  taliesin he thinks theres a swat team  will you should you should talk less  sam smile more  laughter  taliesin i think you smile just the right amount  mary i use my awakened mind to speak to kash telepathically you cant respond out loud so  dont you know how i feel about raishan you know what ive experienced with her keep an eye on  her dont trust her if you see anything while were out there you let me know and well take 
none	  her out all right darling  sam kash why are you drooling and staring off into space  laughter  will was was i drooling  sam oh just a little  will thats my bad im sorry  laura you were talking so much a second ago and  will i was thinking about how i cant wait to die tomorrow yeah  sam well why dont we finalize this plan tomorrow when we meet with the general who will  be what commanding half the forces  marisha i think we need to meet with the general 
none	 like tonight  sam okay lets go  marisha right now  taliesin meet or telepathically communicate  laura i think we should send a message through allura she can just scribble a note and send it  to him  taliesin also that way hell have less time less effort defying us  sam why why not go talk to him  marisha yeah i feel like you cant really scribble an elaborate battle plan in a 25word  message  taliesin its not written down its all telepathic conversation  marisha but the message spell that allura is 
none	 using only allows for very minimal conversation  its not exactly she cant have a fullblown conversation with them  matt its a longdistance twitter  marisha yeah a hundred percent  sam lets go to him  laura all right lets go right now i still think we should eat a heroes feast before we go  just in case  sam when vex wants to spend money im in agreement  laura whats the difference really just to be prepared  marisha well it blows a spell  laura but the day is almost up it will protect 
none	 us all day tomorrow  marisha what time is it  matt after this much conversation its getting closer to sunset probably an hour after  sam oi pike can you do a heroes feast for us  matt sure  laughter  sam thanks pike  matt no problem  mary youre so tiny i didnt even see you  laughter  matt yeah she then goes ahead and casts heroes feast same cost same cost as it also cost her  6thlevel spell slot which ill mark  laura you dont have to we have party funds for 
none	 this dear  matt all right so heroes feast has been summoned for you guys  laura did you just give me 800 im just pocketing your 800 and im putting it in the party gold so  thank you  liam its the same thing  matt so you guys are going to speak to allura then  sam no were doing a heroes feast  will i was told there was brunch  mary i was promised brunch  marisha do we know exactly where the syngorn army is how far away from  matt that you would 
none	 have to talk to allura about shes acting as the information nexus for  everyone it takes an hour you all have to sit and devour the meal for an hour for 12 people  laura okay  matt for your party your two allies there and gilmore and jarett drake anybody else you want  to bring along and as you guys for the next 24 hours  laura and trinket  sam do you need it  laura no  will wait that was you at the beginning  laughter  laura shhshhh  matt kima youd have 
none	 to choose between kima or jarett  taliesin or kima or trinket  laura we have to choose between kima and jarett to come or to eat  matt to eat you only have up to 12 people for the meal  marisha kima shes in the fray  taliesin yeah he can stay back he has a crossbow  matt all righty so that being the case gonna roll 2d10 to see how much everyones maximum hit  points increases  sam oh we dont need to do grog  laura yeah we do  sam hes not here 
none	  matt thats a really good roll thats an eight and a nine so there you go all of you gain 17  additional max hit points for the next 24 hours  marisha wow thats awesome  matt thats actually really really good so keep a note on that  laura and then were immune to fear and poison right  matt and youre immune to poison and the poisoned condition  sam and we have advantage on wisdom saving throws  matt all right im marking this here  will i feel so much healthier and the bacon 
none	 is great fresh lox  sam zabars  laura im so hungry now  mary hollandaise wasnt that blender stuff it was the real thing  matt all right so you finish your meal you summon allura she comes and enters the room she  looks a little frazzled a little sleepless but shes keeping it together all right what do you  require  marisha we were curious if you knew the location of the syngorn army  matt yes weve been keeping in contact they look to be arriving about early afternoon  tomorrow at a far enough 
none	 distance from emon their illusionists have been keeping a blanket in  front of the army to dissuade any visibility and giving away their position in advance  laura oh thats so comforting  will you have numbers  matt they are at lets see here theyre at 2000 troops  laura okay all right  matt give or take and  marisha do you know the status of the other armies  matt well that is the syngorian force and the three daxio the dusk regiment the tide  regiment the dusk the gale and the tide regiments with 
none	 the syngorian forces  liam and all together is 2000  matt yes a little over 2000  will are they all foot  matt they are all foot yes unfortunately with the time given and the transition to and from the  feywild there was an inability to bring with them most of their beasts of burden and horses many of  them were left to scatter shortly after the conclaves attack  sam is there an elite swat team task force  matt i believe thats there is one and they are called vox machina  mary ive 
none	 heard of them  will are there shields  matt they do have shields  will how big  matt uh depends on the regiments i mean  will can we form a phalanx is my question  matt i yes that is  liam he has been training military in whitestone  matt specifically the tide regiment is a frontline shield phalanx  will and how big is it  matt i dont actually have numbers on that youd have to talk to mikael on that the  warmaster  will and theyre going to be attacking a fortified 
none	 location  matt yes the outer walls of emon are guarded by a wall the wall has sustained damage through the  conclaves initial attack and there has not been as far as i know intent to rebuild or at least a  force to be able to since then  laura so if we could get in talk to the clasp and have them find a way to open the gates it  would help the armies  will well thats the thing is youd have to hold the gate once its open thats gonna be the  hardest 
none	 part but 50 men could easily do that  laura plus the clasp which hopefully will be willing to fight  sam hey wheres our stone golem  taliesin far away  sam hes gone  will how many do we know the numbers that are inside the city  matt not specifically as far as the lizardfolk army from what weve heard from asum from brom  from raishan the estimates are somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to nine thousand and at  least five to six hundred wyverns that are  will so we dont control the 
none	 air  matt not on a wide scale no  taliesin we have a single battleship  will were attacking a fortified location with no siege engines outnumbered three to one  taliesin their fortified location also does not have siege engines just air force  marisha their air force is also giant wyvern beasts  matt now understand lizardfolk are not the most hearty the most welltrained theyre a  chaotic force at best and even the bit of unification theyve had under thordaks banner is  thin youve already had luck cutting down a few of their main 
none	 sources of tactics i believe the  general that you slew outside of daxio was one of their main organisers thats a big blow to their  tactic brigade who knows who else is in cahoots with thordak since he took power but weve been  in previous encounters chipping away at their capabilities thordak also does have under his  command a number of fire giants that he brought with him from the fire plane however you also  slew their general  will are they superstitious  matt not to my knowledge no  will any type of 
none	 religion a devil figure in their religion  matt there are they exist among many various devils  will im wondering if we have the illusionist drop the shield when the army gets there and  create an illusion of one of their giant beasts that theyre afraid of on one side of the wall  scatter fear among all of them  taliesin it could work the big fear there of course is that they work for a creature they  already fear quite a bit  laura i think thordak might be scarier than any of their gods 
none	 at this point  will thordak will be busy hopefully we want to move them away from the gate so that the 50 men  can come up through the city and hold the gate  taliesin i think a carrot would be easier than a stick i think it would be better to find a force  for them to rush toward than to find something for them rush away from  marisha do we know how many spellcasters are in the syngorn army  matt i do not have those numbers unfortunately  will that could be interesting 
none	  taliesin more carrot less stick  will you might not even need to see the soldiers just the dust rising from their boots  mary and the horses charging if you can make that kind of illusion  marisha we need to figure out how many spellcasters  matt that would be a conversation with the warmaster  marisha they can throw down longrange large covering spells  sam lets go talk to the warmaster  laura well we dont know where theyll be exactly until tomorrow  matt have that conversation at the ready  marisha all right 
none	 hang on how about this we know that theyre to arrive in emon by the  afternoon we can just try to connect with them in the early morning and march in with them then  split when we get closer to the gates  taliesin and then meet the 50 men at greyskull keep  will do we have access to anything that goes boom  taliesin a little bit do i have anything possibly still leftover at greyskull any of my  supplies  matt you do have a small cache of blackpowder at your disposal its about 
town	 a cask  taliesin i make it myself half the time  will a cask in the right place against an already damaged wall could punch a hole  taliesin it could  will and if were underneath and the foundation is already weakened wed be trapped but the army  could get inside  taliesin do you still have that siege arrow or is that gone now  laura i do i have a siege arrow and grog does extra damage against buildings and walls  matt yes i do boom slams his fists together and as they hit 
none	 you hear what sounds like a very  localized sound of a rockslide just like boom  marisha rad  taliesin so we do have a siege arrow which will basically do the damage of its a  wallshatterer its designed to bring down stone  laura so it damages stone specifically the siege arrow  matt yes it damages anything that is liable to siege  will and it can be fired by anybody  taliesin yes but it is weirdly weighted and shes probably the one you want firing it  laura im a really good archer  
none	 will i remember when i brought you back from the dead  laura yeah oh my god thank you so much  will youre welcome not a problem  mary what am i chopped liver i get nothing i think it was both of us i believe  will that could be interesting though  taliesin yes it could id forgotten about that  will well because what theyll be expecting is for 50 men to come in and hold the gate what if  holding the gate is actually a distraction and then we punch a hole through the 
none	 wall and go in  the back door  laura yes i like it  will but were going to be in the tunnel were working about the top right now  mary but if we can scatter their forces front and back well have the center to come in underneath  and that way if they figure it out theyll have to come from either side  will the 50 men holding the wall the chances of any of them getting out are slim but theyre  going to know that going in  laura these guys are legit 
none	  sam we are the worst people  laura apparently which is terrible it really really is  will its the end of the world they know whats happened  mary youve been dealing with dragons weve been thinking about it  marisha im still concerned we dont have enough air support for the 500 wyverns  mary i think we might have to let that go  matt allura chimes in and goes as far as i understand thats part of the reason youre  bringing the mages with you  marisha yes well im thinking  taliesin ground 
none	 to air  will how big is the airship  marisha i wasnt wanting to necessarily tap into this resource unless necessary but i think its  necessary i can contact the air ashari and have them specifically on air support  liam and they can get themselves here quick like you  laura they can go through trees instant  taliesin it can hold two dozen people on that ship right  laura we need all of the ashari  taliesin its about three cannonade  mary is there anyone that could put an illusion on the airship to 
none	 make it seem like another  dragon  sam i could put a slight illusion on it but itd be pretty easy  will im just wondering if theres a way to draw their air force to the airship and then blow it up  liam we also supposedly have a green dragon as an ally  sam oh yeah  laura i fucking forgot the ravenites said they would help us too i just remembered  sam well we sent word to them didnt we didnt we send word to everybody  matt you sent word to a few 
none	 specific entities not the ravenites  laura how long would it take  taliesin vox machina swearing that theyre going to call you back for four years  laughter  laura fuck are they too far  matt theyre like a continent away  will wait you can bring in air force  marisha i can contact my father at the air ashari  sam do that we also need to contact gilmore  will if you control the air you control the battle  matt gilmore is accompanying you and i believe kima is going to come along as 
none	 well  taliesin we also have your friend  matt the airship we dont know quite exactly where it is and when it will arrive i dont know  if we can count on it being there by the time you make this assault but theyre going there as soon  as they can  taliesin it has cannonade as well and it is designed to hold sieges in the air so it will  keep many of them busy and theyre not that bright  will if its not coming though you cant count it among them  taliesin 
none	 we cant count on anythingthat would be  will huge  marisha can you message korren  matt ive not met korren  marisha oh shit  matt if you could take me to him  marisha uhhuh yeah right yes because were not leaving until the morning now sure yeah oh  man gasps who wants to go see my hometown you guys  sam dubious noise  marisha okay you know what i wasnt looking at you scanlan okay  i can show you where i went to school  mary keyleth we need to get back here 
none	 as soon as possible  will you went to school  laughter  liam that was catty  taliesin we were like back in school suddenly that was great  will i formally apologize  taliesin that went so john hughes so quickly  laughter  laura are we expecting you back tonight  mary and the rest of us can rest yes  matt rest and prepare for everything you can for tomorrow this happens  liquid pouring  taliesin i swear if youre aerating wine under there im going to be so upset  laughter  will i 
none	 just saw it out of the corner it was great  matt all you had to do was ask im working toward getting the break buddy  sam sigh feels so much better  mary before we go to bed i would like to talk to vex very quickly  matt as you guys are going to prepare to make your way to the air ashari zahra pulls you  aside  mary darling  laura yes  mary i have major concerns about raishan i dont know that we can trust her i just want you to  keep 
none	 your eyes on her while you were gone i tried as hard as i could to glean anything from  her and the closer i thought i got i found out that i knew nothing about her and she knows  everything about me  laura she knows everything about all of us dear  mary dont trust her  laura not even for a minute  mary dont trust her if it comes to it ill go down taking her out  laura id rather you didnt  mary so would i  laura i have to do it 
none	 i have to insight check zahra to make sure shes really zahra  sam oh shit  matt make an insight check  liam no thats good thats good  laura i love you  liam pretty good  taliesin i can also say theres an easy way to do this  matt turn that way real fast  taliesin just go downstairs  sam in surfer accent hey guys dont forget decembers theme is revolution featuring items  from assassins creed mr robot firefly and more dont forget to go to  lootcratecomcriticalrole and enter critical role for 10 
none	 off my bruh  matt thats the worst use of seeming ive ever seen  laughter  matt all righty  laura when did you even speak to her  mary while you were gone you know ive been spending time shes been down in the ziggurat  laura yes  mary so ive seen her ive seen her form as i guess you have as well  laura yes  mary after rimefang i sort of became obsessed with dragons  laura i know the feeling laughs  mary yes its a wonderful feeling isnt it but i also 
none	 know that she was part of it and the  minute a dragon says trust me is the minute you dont  laura especially her  mary especially her so while you were gone i tried i tried to find out as much about thordak  as i could  laura just know that we dont trust her  mary all right  laura i dont even know if shes really sick  mary i actually believe her in that respect but thordak is the only one that can cure her and if  thats the case if she believes 
none	 that then we are nothing we are expendable to her the minute  she sees thordak thats the carrot that he has put in front of her is that i will heal you  and he hasnt done it yet i dont think he will  laura i dont think he really can  mary if he does were fucked thats all  laura youre not alone in this at least  mary good thats good  laura shes not our friend  mary she can be persuasive thank you darling  matt you separate for the evening to gather 
none	 your mind gather your supplies and prepare for the  coming battle while the rest of you find yourselves resting for the evening keyleth and  vax find yourselves walking towards the sun tree to make your journey  marisha is allura coming with us too  matt if you want to ask her to come with you  marisha i thought she was  matt im sorry yeah  marisha she doesnt have to  matt youre right no she goes with you  marisha okay come on allura lets go  matt of course certainly  marisha its 
none	 great we have these really great crepes that we make its like our hometown  special  matt if theres time i would love to have some dont know if well have time  marisha okay okay  matt so you all walk your way down to the sun tree you open the portal immediately on the  opposite side you see as it is nighttime in this part of exandrias hemisphere what looks to be a  beautiful simple village made of curved wood almost dometype structures but not huts theres  no thatch theyre really wellcrafted long intricate 
none	 strips of wood like its been grown to a  specific shape it creates these interesting domiciles that are all built you see beyond that  on the edge of a sheer cliff and the minute you step through the wind hits you there is a strong wind  immediately on the outside of this tree and you feel your cloak being blown to the side you look  over behind the tree that you just stepped out of and its another cliff that vanishes into darkness  below the air ashari village of zephrah lies at the very top 
none	 of this mountain range for a brief  second you get vertigo glancing over your shoulder keyleth steps through with a big smile  on her face you see allura step through and as soon as she sees this happen she clasps and keeps  her hair down not wanting to be like you right now with your hair blowing in the wind  you take a few steps toward the village probably close to 100 homes at most built into the  mountainside it goes up into a hill with trees that surround the outskirts of it you see 
none	 small  lights that are lit throughout so it has this firefly feel glimmering through as soon as you  step maybe ten or 15 feet from the tree the wind just stops  liam what happened to the wind  marisha i mean were air ashari we dont have to live in a hellscape our whole lives come on  we control it its great sighs doesnt it smell good it smells so fresh up here you know  you dont have to deal with the pollution down there oh look over there thats where i learned  to 
town	 shapeshift into a squirrel for the first time  matt keyleth keyleth were here on business  marisha yeah no then lets start walking  matt please lead on  marisha okay yeah and over there was the first time that my dad taught me how to fly he just  pushed me off the cliff  liam i have my hand on her back and i just start  matt laughing pushing her forward  you eventually make your way back there are a number of trees that are grown through some of the  buildings or buildings are 
town	 built around them or from them its a very beautiful simple  naturallooking series of structures that are all so smooth in their design that it was obviously  bent with some druidic magic to craft this space  currently there is nobody you see visible walking through the city most everything is closed off  for the night the little lanternlike lights you saw before are coming from the inside of these  buildings  marisha its a quiet mountain town everything closes at like five it was actually annoying  growing up  mary you live in south 
dung	 pointe  liam that explains so much  laughter  marisha i told you it was remote  matt i want both of you to roll a perception check  marisha 14 total  liam 22  matt okay as shes talking and you guys are walking you notice a little dark spot just  covering past the stars arcing quickly in your direction  liam i spin her around and tilt her head back whats that do you know what that is is that  normal  marisha do i know what that is is that normal  matt 
none	 once you see it you recognize the trajectory of it this is a person rocketing  toward you  marisha oh thats a person  laughter  marisha no really is this normal  matt its normal for you because this is a person riding a skysail  marisha oh it is normal for me oh like a yeah  matt as the person swoops up and then lands its a sort of glider it resembles a pogo stick  in the fact that feet are placed on top of it and elements are grasped on the side its a 
none	 large  leatherwinged structure that immediately folds up and is held like a staff to the side  liam whoa thats nifty hi  matt standing before you is korren your father  marisha dad  matt he looks surprised he lands in a very aggressive comingtoseewhatsgoingontype  way and as soon as he looks keyleth i wasnt expecting  marsiha hi village looks great i see you guys have been keeping up with the landscaping this is  awesome hi how are you  matt he hugs you but its a tense hug and he pats your shoulder were 
none	 good i  marisha whats wrong  matt well things as they are i know youre probably here for not a passing visit am i  correct in this assumption  marisha i mean i guess you could say it was going to be passing in that we dont have a lot of  time were here to ask for help for the air asharis aid  matt we were waiting for specific word based on our last conversation we have ways of finding  information about whats going on in the world with the armies that have been mounting 
none	 making  their way towards emon weve been keeping a watch on the gathering energy toward the west coast of  taldorei we were preparing ourselves so if youve come to ask for our aid were ready  marisha why do i sense trepidation in your voice  matt because we know what we face because my daughter is going to war against something that we  watched tear through the countryside not long after you were born im just concerned as a  parent that is all  marisha you sent me on this path to prove myself worthy 
none	 and a hero im following what i thought  you wanted of me  matt you are and im proud of you i just want to do what i can to help safeguard that  marisha i will continue my duties as i promised from the beginning  matt of course  marisha as those supersede being your daughter  matt of course  marisha and i am here for unfortunate reasons and i wish i wasnt we need the best we need as  many of the top soldiers that we have im looking at you at my people 
none	 for air support theres  about five maybe six hundred maybe even more wyverns covering the city so far we dont have a  lot of options  matt we know wyverns well thats the good news we can probably facilitate this request  marisha i was hoping maybe some of the best nature manipulators could create a hazardous storm  ahead of time see what we can do to take out as much in bulk  matt we can do that yeah  sam whispering she went to school  marisha i know i got educated  matt we 
none	 can do that when is this set to happen  marisha tomorrow afternoon  matt all right well get our conjurers together and begin building a storm front well send it  midday tomorrow then what sign should we look for to enter the fray  marisha oh shit  sam just anything  liam a flare we have flares kiki we have flares  marisha we have flares  laughter  matt very well  laughter  marisha were spitballing this as we go dad so we can work on a sign together right  matt sure i mean 
none	 if were creating a sky of rain and darkness just make the sky itself a sign  marisha i can do that  matt all right something id know something id recognize  marisha okay  matt well go in there and tear as many of those wyverns as we can to the ground  liam youre not alone there is an army of elves marching as we speak  marisha the syngorn army  matt weve seen them traversing their illusions are strong but their illusions are faced towards  the city we have the luxury of knowing their 
none	 magic so yes  marisha with all due respect if you have seen through their illusion does that mean im sure  many of thordaks spies could do the same  matt it depends on who he has on his side i hope thats not the case  marisha yeah me too are you going to come as well  matt i do not wish to live in a world where the dangers that continue to press upon the free  peoples of this or any land draws my daughter to the front lines to fight kill and possibly die 
none	  and i stay back and do nothing so yes i will be there  marisha what about zephrah what about the village who is going to watch it while youre gone  matt we have enough to spare for this and protect our people besides as you well know the  protections in this village prevent wayward fliers  marisha okay this is vax by the way  matt weve met  marisha yeah you have  matt good to see you  marisha he came with me so yeah see you tomorrow i guess  matt see you

dung	 a plus two armor  you would lose the plus two on top of the actual armor  laura thats a big drop im going to take my bracers off then  matt okay so youre doing two less damage per attack  laura yes  matt okay  liam thats smarter thats wise  mary im going to attune my charred dark staff  matt all right good  marisha and im going to go ahead and attune to my cape instead of my ring  matt okay  liam im attuning the dragon sword and i want to

none	 you feel a slight vibration into your lower pauldron and you look down and the sword  has not hurt you but it has definitely pierced the plates behind the armor and hes showing hes  posturing that he already has availability with the blade between your armor  will interesting  liam i jump back five feet  laughter  will i flame strike no im kidding  laughter  liam evasion  will just jump right to it  matt wheres vox machina well um they killed each other its weird  laughter  so as you both 
town	 stand there in a moment squaring off the tension still in the city from the coming  event but people are starting to look out and gather theyre having a morpheus is fighting  neo moment as people are starting to pull others from nearby buildings and gather in a small  circle around  marisha yeah i go up to vex and go why why is this happening is this happening for like  a did they tell you did they tell you the reason  laura theyre fighting over you darling theyre fighting over you  marisha i 
none	 can tell ive been with you for a long time i can tell when youre lying to me  laura they both professed their love and now theyre fighting  marisha now youre patronizing me  liam calls were really not that far away are we going to do this you ready  will im ready when you are  matt whos making the first move  liam me are we doing initiative or attacks i dont even know what this is  matt the initiative was whoever said me first so  marisha i didnt know how badly i 
none	 wanted this until now  taliesin boy i did  liam oh man what are we fighting to here we go so that is the first and that is im going  to use luck  marisha youre about to fight a fucking dragon youre fighting kash  matt you do realize you only have youre spending your luck for  liam i spent it already just so were clear everybody im going to switch back to liam  this is a game this is a game which cameras on me this is a game  will your fun is 
none	 wrong  mary your fun is very wrong  liam so its an 18  matt an 18 whats your armor class with your shield  will my armor class is 20  matt as you go to strike with the sword  liam thats the first one  matt yes with your sword and so now youre attacking with your  liam natural 20 with whisper  matt with whisper okay all right so as he swings with the sword with your shield you  deflect it off to the side and youre about to bring your spear through 
none	 for your own strike  however hes suddenly much closer than you expected and you feel the blade shirk the side of  the armor so for the purposes of this were not rolling damage because its to spar  liam thank you  matt but the blade hits and pokes just enough where you know thats maybe thats where the  kidney is  will right okay  matt and in that brief moment you see the little creeping smile up the side of his mouth you go  ahead and roll your attack now kashaw  will 18 
none	  matt plus  will plus well if im using my i dont want to use the shadow spear should we use lets not  do nec damage on him lets think its just a regular plus two right  liam so what is he at  matt 20  liam nope  matt well its a plus two spear whats your attack bonus altogether  will oh with the attack bonus is plus ten  matt so thats 28  will 28 to you yeah  liam oh that definitely hits  matt yeah so after you get the 
dung	 blade there theres that moment of posturing how do you  deflect him off  will i think yeah the blade comes in hes got his spear so as the blade comes in he slaps his  arm away and just takes it right lightly across the chest so it just cuts into the little bit of fat  matt just slicing noise you back away and you see two of the mantlelike dark feathers of  your armor the very tips just go puff  will and then i look at you and go oneone  laughter  mary 
none	 i cast eldritch blast two beams right in front of either one of them  matt as you guys are having this moment all of a sudden the ground detonates before you in a haze  of greenishwhite arcane energy you see now these small basketballsized concave blast craters in  the ground before each of you and right off to the side you see zahra standing staff in one  hand hand before her with the other  liam oh you do have two different color eyes theyre so nice  mary i use thaumaturgy to go fire with 
none	 my eyes  will were just playing  mary all right boys enough i appreciate it  liam all right well play slap and tickle later  mary your fun is wrong play slaptickle later lets do this  liam anyway sword works sure  matt all right you sheath the sword so you guys gather the rest of your materials together  taliesin we still have that spare sword that was just that standard rapier that was just in the bag  before from the general correct  laura grog has the bag of holding and i dont know 
none	 whats in it  taliesin i think we have it we still have just a very standard nothing where its barely a plus one  matt yeah its barely enchanted  liam whatd you need it for  taliesin just in case someone gets close enough to me that its complicated  liam i have a shortsword but that sounds better  taliesin its probably better its whatever stonefell had  matt shortsword is dexbased so youre going to probably want to run with that  marisha i need to roll really fast to recharge my spire so im going 
dung	 to do that real fast  matt all right and actually you should roll to recharge your wand  marisha it goes all the way up it is full again  matt all right  marisha i rolled four plus four  matt twice actually for two nights of rest so  will my spires full  mary so is mine  sam seven so im back up to normal  matt okay all righty as you guys are preparing gilmore comes out hes usually dressed in his  usual casual flowing robes or his wizard tracksuittype outfit the outfit 
none	 you see on him  its more ornamental and its specifically more so than youve seen him wear it has a very  similar design and presentation of some of the more noble individuals you saw wandering marquet  ankharel in particular he seems to be going more ceremonial than youre used to seeing gilmore  laura what color are the robes  matt oh they are very much purple and gold he keeps to his aesthetic but the design is  definitely ceremonial different than anything youve seen him wear  marisha wow  liam full bollywood  marisha 
none	 yeah thats what i was thinking about  sam is it his old boy scout uniform or what  matt its a long mantle that travels down to the lower part of his torso where his arms come out  from these long sleeves that come to a fine point at the ends he still has all of his jewelry on  but where the belt is you can see its a very thick heavy belt that like ties to a bow in the  center almost like a reverse kimono that comes to a square point and the robe 
none	 itself drops low and  flows behind him as he walks its really pretty as he walks in hes holding himself with the  gilmore air but you can still see a bead of sweat down his head and a little bit of nervous energy  very well i guess todays the day  taliesin be pleased  sam how are we going to get there  matt be pleased  will are we speaking to the general first  sam yeah were going there first but not via a tree we have to go via something else  laura 
none	 why not via a tree  sam is there a tree on the battlefield where they are  laura well its not a battlefield  marisha i will be able to find out when we scry if not well have to talk to allura im going to  scry real quick scrying eye  matt who are you scrying on  marisha cant hide from my scrying eyes your dad whats his name syldor okay  taliesin syldor the inevitably disappointed thats his full title  matt okay you scry syldor you have a bit of a flash of green 
none	 lots of green endless green your  vision jumps into a familiar warm home you see syldor nervously sitting with his daughter on his  knee and theyre talking syldor is back in syngorn syldor isnt a fighter syldor is a  diplomat  taliesin oh thats fair  laura right right  will did you see them where are they  marisha happy and healthy and comfortable by a fire  will the whole army is happy and healthy and comfortable by a fire  marisha no hes not with the army is what i mean oh shit i 
none	 thought he was going to be with  the army  taliesin its okay we have plan b lets go deal with plan b  marisha okay ill scry again  taliesin or we can make allura do it  marisha allura do you know where they are  laura she can take us to daxio  matt i dont know specifically where they are and she sits for a second and sets up a rush job  of a scry ritual cause now she feels shes been put on the spot but she puts it together  marisha can 
none	 i help her a little bit  matt yeah you give her a little aid you pay it back to the last time you helped her with a scry  spell back when you first met in emon and her eyes blink over white again cloudy and she  returns all right i see mikael and the army gathered and there is a very energetic air to  them theyre looking restless i can bring eight of you with me  sam well are there any trees near them  matt there are yeah  marisha the problem is it 
none	 generally has to be a tree that im familiar with  sam if you go with her youll be familiar with the tree  marisha it doesnt work that way  laura question if you go and you open up a path to the sun tree can people on this side run  through the sun tree  marisha can i thats an excellent question can i  matt wait so if you transport via plants  marisha like if i go with allura and then open a gate through the sun tree and theyre just ready  to rock 
none	  taliesin do you have a sling ring  marisha oh damn it fucking lost my sling ring  matt it does it connects the plants on both sides  cheering  marisha hey ill do that does anyone else want to go just in case  laura yeah the eight of us need to go and then how many is that left  matt that would leave  sam four  matt then grog pike and gilmore and kima and jarett yeah we could bring everybody  laura and drake  matt is drake coming and she looks off 
none	 to the side and you see this little figure running down  from the castle at the top carrying all this shit in his arms hold on im and you watch him  just eat shit he just tumbles scatters gets up and is like no one saw that picks it back up  runs back down and catches up  taliesin are we supposed to get something from the oh god we were supposed to werent we  supposed to grab something earlier my brain is just turning to mush  sam we got it already  taliesin oh 
none	 we got it already never mind thats right  laura yeah yeah yeah he gave it to us  marisha wheres raishan though  liam yeah are we going to talk to whatsherbutt  sam shell find us shes not our problem shes not our problem were not babysitting a dragon  taliesin in fact if anything the less we speak to her at this point probably the better  will and youre sure shes coming  matt dont worry shes coming and you hear another dwarven voice from the side as you glance  out you see theres standing 
none	 not too far from you arms crossed larkin  cheering  liam buddy where have you been ive been fucking worried sick you were there you were  gone howd you even get back here  marisha vax please dont  liam listen im fucking with you all right whats up green bean  matt so are we ready for this  taliesin no  matt didnt think so lets do it  sam so you all go ill stay with these ragtag group and sit by the tree and get ready  laura and marisha all right  matt 
none	 allura grabs you and takes kima and the rest of the group that she can and over time you  guys manage to get well say for the sake of brevity here everyone back over to the war camp  itself and it is a fairsized war camp and whats interesting is as youre within this camp  you look up and in a similar way the illusion barrier that surrounds whitestone that very very  faint shimmering effect is present but its much stronger and its much more visceral in the way  that it alters the visuals it 
none	 looks like the sky is this perpetual shifting kaleidoscope of colors  the blue sky becomes green becomes purple becomes red it just constantly shifts like the  surface of a pond thats been perpetually rippling  and you see on the outskirts of the war camp this rotating guard of illusionists that are taking  time to just restore and maintain this illusion as everyone else is eating polishing their  weapons and armor you see a mix of elven warriors elven archers and very similar to the  daxio soldiers you met earlier but armor of different crests 
town	 signifying the different  regiments  it doesnt take you too long to eventually come upon and be led to the tent where mikael is the  warmaster himself the warmaster i do not believe youve met before personally  as you enter and look within you can see the warmaster it sets you off at first because he  does resemble his son his son who you did not have quite a positive experience with hes an  older elvish man his hair just past shoulderlength but pulled into a very very  tight ponytail in the back with 
none	 a few strands that fall in front of his face he has a very  very strong jaw for an elf hes a thick and wellbuilt warrior and holds that with both a  strength and commanding respect and everyone around him definitely looks up to him you can  immediately see why hes the warmaster and how hes held that position for so long and you also  wonder one how his son fell so hard and two how it must have affected him  but in that instant as you enter hes in the process of having a 
town	 conversation and they have a  layout of what looks to be a brief sketch of emon in its current state with a few things here and  there marking where most of the gathered elements of the army whatever youd call it the defense  of emon exists and as you all begin to enter the tent he goes oh hello i know of you and ive  been expecting you allura has been kind enough to fill me in in bits and pieces but as far as i am  to understand youre our strike force  laura 
none	 the elite swat team heading in there  matt good to know this weve been walking for quite some time and the soldiers have had a bit  of rest if we could we would take an additional day just to put it at our most capable but it  seems time is not at our beck and call in this situation and as such when the sun is down i  think that is the agreedupon time to strike  sam at sundown all right sure yeah yeah sure  taliesin most of these soldiers have at least night 
none	 vision some form of darkvision i assume  matt most of the syngorian army does and we have quite a few at daxio that do as well  will flatly how are you going to attack  laura this is kashaw  will hi how are you going to attack  matt pleasure to meet you as well so we have broken up the regiments into five different  segments were going to separate leading into the initial strike were going to simultaneously  hit the four main gates the north south east and west side the easternmost gate has 
none	 already  received quite a bit of damage with all the simultaneous strikes were hoping to draw most of  the army to the outer circles of the city were going to utilize this time to then shift our  forces southward and instead push towards a singular gate in a southward position while  theyre scattered in that direction if im to understand what allura has told me you are going  to be entering from underneath the city  taliesin that is the plan  matt and attempting to facilitate the opening of one or more of these 
none	 gates in doing so  laura that would be swell if we can huh  matt that would be  taliesin we havent really discussed it but  laura no no no but we have talked about doing it  taliesin or even breaching the south gate alone would be if all four gates are being  will any time we go out and we attack a gate theyre going to bring all of their forces to that  gate what theyre not going to be suspecting is a wall being ripped down and once you open a wall  
none	 you cant close it you can close a gate  laura whats the weakest wall  matt that would be the eastern wall  taliesin its also near greyskull keep  mary oh thats the arrow that youre going to use yes  matt while we are not in a position to use siege weaponry we do have most of our mages at our  disposal and they have prepared a modicum of siegebased arcane spells at their disposal so i  do not think piercing the outer wall will be an issue its what lies beyond it that our 
none	 focus is  going to be sow confusion separate and destroy they are not a very wellorganized army and most  of the creatures weve seen wandering the skies do so with nothing but bloodlust and the intent to  rend and tear as their main driving force and goal so utilizing that technique and weve  discussed youll be entering the walls well be pushing forward phalanx method with those that  are shielded we will be piercing through and scattering from the inside breaking their ranks  as much as possible and doing our best to stay out 
none	 of the skies using alleyways using small  streets we dont want our men being plucked out from the middle from their air support  laura we will have air support  marisha i called in assistance from the air ashari from the north theyre maintaining the skies  matt the ashari are aiding us as well  will do you know how many  marisha did dad tell me how many  matt he said roughly a hundred  marisha oh shit thanks dad roughly a hundred  will if i can make a suggestion if you get into 
none	 the city dont move through the alleys youre  going to scatter your forces move into the city and fortify a position so then youve opened a  gate inside the city move the command center inside the city and defend from there  matt that is indeed part of our push however we are rather vulnerable from the air so with the  air ashari giving us air support that will allow us the ability that we need to push forward as a  singular unit from unit to unit in its own right you are entering from where 
none	  sam the sewers  laura yes we have a secret entrance in our keep if we can still access it if not there is an  entrance to the sewers towards the water we were told of it by the clasp right  sam ive also used a tunnel to get out at some point  marisha thats right when you were looking for kaylie  matt that was westruun  sam its the same sewer system though right  mary its the same basic layout of a city yeah right  laura wait wait the traverse junction whats 
none	 the traverse junction  matt the traverse junction is was is as far as i know still attached to the lyceum but  sam the lyceums unguarded  matt the lyceum is partially destroyed and is filled with the remains of the enemy  sam i remember that  laura thats not what i meant then that wasnt the thing that i meant to say  marisha and we know thordak has made an underground basin he only emerges when someone  challenges him or offers their loyalty  mary were we supposed to meet the clasp in a specific 
none	 place  sam weve just got to get to a sewer  mary so we just need to find a sewer and then were going to reconnoiter with is that the  right word anyway with the clasp and at that point we shall make our way through  matt all right  will and thats when the thieves and liars will take us to the thing thats going to kill us all  were very excited about the plan  matt i can tell  will yeah do we have the 50 soldiers we need or do we need 
none	 to ask them for 50  sam did they ever show up did the 50 soldiers from fort daxio show up  matt i had heard that daxio had fallen there are survivors  laura well there were there were about 55 soldiers  matt they havent found their way to us yet then well keep an eye out  taliesin they might be headed towards greyskull if i recall i believe they were heading there  laura thats true they should be crossing paths very shortly  taliesin 50 men can move quietly  laura so after you cut 
none	 through all of the lizardmen like butter youll make your way to  thordak  matt thats the intent to push in towards the cloudtop and based on how well you andor any of  the air forces have been able to puncture the defenses push in towards the creature itself and  unleash everything we have at the beast as far as i know and have been told from some of the  remaining members of the council they have a few members still within the city i believe tofor  brotoras seeker asum and brom goldhand are still 
none	 within the city  sam well not asum we know where he is  laura and brom  mary i thought brom was at whitestone  laura dont say that word out loud  mary i said it to you quietly  laura yeah very quietly  taliesin well gather what we can we dont really know whats actually in there yet  marisha and we cant trust anyone within the city limits  matt understood  will do you have a time frame for your attack  matt we are intending once the men have been fed once the 
none	 men have been able to rest and  prepare their armaments we were going to attack upon sundown yes  will and you plan to breach the city when  matt hopefully within the first hour of the attack  will really  matt thats the intent  will how far do you think we can make it in the tunnels in an hour  taliesin pretty far to be honest especially if were well no thats  sam 20 blocks  will you making that number up  sam yep  will you just pulled that out of nowhere 
none	  sam absolutely  taliesin its the highest number he knows grogs not here i have to do something  sam an hour we can probably make it i dont know we can make it deep into the city but not  all the way to the center can we  taliesin no not in an hour  liam its a maze in there but the tunnel from our keep in if its intact was not that far  matt if you were to traverse the tunnel system in advance of our attack that would perhaps aid  us in 
none	 syncing our maneuvers  sam so we should go now  will that would be the goal is to act as point for the entire army  matt that would indeed be the goal  laura so what the minute we pop out we send up a flare  matt some sort of a sign hopefully something not quite as easy to read as a sign of aggression  weve taken much care to not be seen this far  sam or we could just wait for sundown and then go knowing that theyre going to strike at the  
dung	 same time  taliesin we go now  sam no i mean once we get in there we wait until we pop out until its getting dark  outside  liam i mean what kind of symbol do we send up in a sky full of wyverns  laura what if were not in position by sundown  marisha the ashari are already looking for a symbol i plan to be aiding them they should be  helping us with  sam what about a storm  marisha well there will be a storm  will wait theres a storm 
dung	 coming  sam can you make one  matt as you guys actually glance over you can see in the eastern sky past the iron seat  ridge there is an extremely dark building stormfront that is just looming miles off in the  distance  marisha see told you  sam what about kiki what if you just made some lightning strikes to signal the start of the fight  taliesin i think nature itself is going to make some lightning strikes  marisha well ive got my whole skywrite thing ive got my whole skywrite thing i can 
none	 make a  symbol in the air out of clouds which isnt as terrifying as everyone has thought it is in the  past we just need to pick a symbol  laura it just has to be subtle something your dad will recognize huh  mary a phoenix or something  will how is the storm going to affect your attack is my question  matt we are trained to undergo warfare in many different forms of terrain and weather  mary my concern is that if we wait until this storm comes in the sewers will be flooded 
none	 we  need to go in now before the storm gets here  will but if we get lost in there and the storm comes itll be flooded while were in there  sam the storm isnt a real storm isnt it air ashari  laura no no no its air ashari  taliesin but its still a real storm  matt if there is rain to come with the storm that is fortuitous for much of the city still  burns but fire we can quell with a storm would be helpful  marisha its acoming man its coming 
none	  matt right good to know this  liam well lets go  sam to greyskull keep  marisha look for keep your eye on the sky  matt i will have two of my hawkeyes keeping an eye at the clouds  marisha there will be a symbol it will be super obvious when its determined youll be like oh  of course it couldnt have been anything else when you see it  matt i look forward to solving your riddle you as well stay safe  marisha dont know what the fuck its going to be it 
none	 could be a big vm for vox machina i mean  like you know we could be like now fucking attack  liam are there clouds overhead now above the city  matt if you look up its the weather over heres been fairly clear there are a few wispy  white clouds but nothing that is indicative of a storm yet  taliesin if the storm has taken the city there will be a break in the storm of a perfect circle  where we are attacking  will the eye of a hurricane  taliesin the eye of 
none	 a hurricane if it is not a force we can certainly look for it  liam and if the skies are clear theyll not be clear  taliesin it will be a nice column that will  matt all right then  will look for the stillness in the storm  matt we shall travel safe travel swift  mary safe journey  matt you as well good luck  sam be pleased remember the plan is chaos  laura total chaos  will chaos can work  taliesin chaos works very well  laura we make our way to 
none	 greyskull  taliesin back to greyskull  matt all right as you guys make your way towards greyskull keep walking through as you see rows  and rows of soldiers of different walks of life all part of the alliance of taldorei between  syngorn and emon many of them watch as you pass some just curious as to what regiment you belong  to and you get a couple of occasional looks of recognition  laura i wink  will dale where you been man  matt wait kash  will what the hells going on  matt going 
none	 to die today what are you doing  will pretty much the same thing man hows anne  matt annes not doing too well  will aw im sorry to hear that  matt yeah she was in the city when the dragons attacked  will no she wasnt  matt yeah  will oh thats horrible  matt its okay were going to kill them today right  will were getting there buddy good to see you youre looking good  matt good to see you too you too  will all right ill see you later man  
none	 matt all right  will that was i havent seen that guy in forever so bizarre sorry lets go  sam small world man small world  liam and were walking and were walking and were walking  taliesin i feel like ive had that awkward four minutes of like every con ever oh god  matt as you guys exit the side ranks of the current encampment as they are all preparing the  sun itself growing maybe about two hours out from touching the horizon you can see in the  distance on some of the outer embankment 
none	 and small structures that litter the walls of emons  surrounding fields you see greyskull keep a very welcoming longtime coming return as you stay low  to the grass i need you all to make stealth checks  laura oh shit oh shit oh shit you roll a 20 and then you  marisha oh natural 20  matt nice  sam natural 20 right here as well  marisha really eh natural 20 bros  taliesin natural 19 i havent added yet  marisha fuck you  mary ten  laura should i cast pass without a trace 
none	 on all of us is it too late can i just add it to  everybodys if i cast it now  matt as you guys were going stealthy ill say sure because you would have known at this point  to do so if you want to spend your spell slot to do that sure  laura i do  liam and thats plus ten right  laura yeah it adds ten to all of your rolls  mary 20  liam 35 now  laura 30  taliesin 35 35 with the plus ten 35  matt all 
none	 right as you guys all stay low and guarding each other keeping an eye out to make  sure nobody is giving too much away you manage to go unnoticed  marisha coughing sorry i so inhaled my spit keep going  matt dont do that thats bad  will make a breathing saving throw  marisha coughing im still dying for a second go on guys  liam i rolled double ones wheezing  matt you guys make your way to greyskull keep front doors open like partially ajar not locked  liam i move in forward  matt 
none	 okay you head inside first  liam im going to poke my head in first  matt make a perception check  liam 27  matt you take a moment and look around listen carefully no sound  liam so far so good im going to move further in and continue to im going to check for traps  matt go for it investigation check  liam fine sure investigation is an 18  matt okay nothing appears to be trapped here if anything is out of place you know this area  pretty well so  laura were making 
dung	 our way to the doorway we peek in now  mary is it very dark in there  matt there are no current set torches or candlelight whatsoever there are a few openings  that bring some light in specifically from sarenraes temple but other than that it is  pretty dark in the hallways  mary can i see anything with darkvision  matt with darkvision youre fine as you guys glance around and begin to scatter throughout the  keep you can see signs that it has been lived in people have been rummaging through there is no

none	 the ladder  that leads you into the alleyway on the outskirts of the southern edge of emon you make your way  up well it leads you through an outhouse an alley youve been here before  liam im gonna yes im gonna peek through the pooper first lets see what i see  matt perception check  liam yeah okay thats fine  laura we know where the entrance to the tunnels are though  liam im just looking for anything unexpected 27  matt it is empty and still chained  liam are there poos  matt

none	 matt the storm is getting closer  taliesin i think that we will not act like lizard people and also anybody who can see through  there are like  laura lizard people cant see through that  taliesin they are idiots but they also  sam all we need is a second to get some confusion  taliesin theyre used to seeing humans though and as long as we scatter and are fearful theyll  matt i dont mind being invisible thats not an issue meaning i can make a number of us invisible  if you want to 
none	 go  laura how many can you  matt not all of you obviously but like if some of you wanna go as lizardfolk or somebody  else can  laura i want to be invisible  liam invisible please  sam youve got a ring that makes you invisible  liam im busy with other things also its maybe time for another feast isnt it  taliesin were still good i think  liam its about sundown when we did it last we did it before beddiebye  sam but that takes an hour were not gonna sit here 
none	 in the sewer eating a fucking  liam we cannot fucking fight thordak without a heroes feast  marisha how long has it been is it almost up  will 40 minutes until battle  matt well i mean you guys its about 40 minutes until sundown  sam we dont have time  laura can we eat a really fast feast  taliesin mcfeast  marisha when did we eat the feast last night about this time are we about to expire or can we  push it was it a midnight snack  matt you guys would choose 
none	 the most optimal time since there was no rush to eat the feast  laura yes we would have  matt you would have been like well shit lets do it at 600 because were fighting thats  probably when you guys wouldve so you probably have until the end of the evening  liam three or four hoursish  matt there would have been no benefit to doing it earlier  taliesin this is going to be over before that these things move quickly  sam am i turning us into lizard people  laura some of us but 
none	 im invisible because of gilmore  marisha are we making an aboveground jump to the underground tunnels again  will someone knows where theyre going right  mary wheres the clasp are we going to meet up with them at some point  taliesin once were down there theyll know were here  marisha how far is the tunnel jump how long do we have to be above ground im asking because i  might be able to make some holes in the wall to cut us into other tunnels and not have to go above  ground at all 
none	  matt when you recall garthok leading you through emon to get to the clasp entrance you had to be  above ground for probably about 20 minutes  marisha 20 minutes  will thats a lifetime above ground  matt a lot of it was spent slow because you guys were stealthy jumping from alley to alley and  being very stealthy if it was a brisk pace it could be as fast as ten  marisha that was to the entrance to the clasp not the entrance to the sewer system right  matt correct  laura we 
none	 could just pop down to a sewer do we see a sewer hole  matt if you want to go inspect you could look for one  sam then we have to find our way through the sewer that we dont really know how to get  through we should find the clasp entrance  laura this plan is smart wait once we get to the clasp then we have to fucking talk to the clasp  sam yeah for a second  laura all right  mary theyre going to help us right  laura its all on scanlan 
none	 hes very charming kash dont talk when were in there  will i wont speak remember that time i saved your life  laura it was wonderful and im very grateful  will no were good  laura im very glad youre here though  will thank you thats very sweet  matt all right are we lizarding and then invising  laura yes and then were going to go quickly to the clasp entrance  sam all right ill make us all lizard people even the ones turning invisible  laura no i dont want to be a lizard

none	 sam i can do me  laura dont waste a spell  mary im not its an invocation  matt seeming affects how many people  sam as many as are near me when i cast it any number of creatures it says  matt that is awesome seeming is broken  sam seeming is broken  taliesin how appropriate that were going to be underground lizard people in the city of los angeles  marisha yeah its very appropriate  taliesin it is our best urban myth the lizard people of los angeles  will thats not a myth 
none	 i have a friend who knows somebody who saw one  taliesin thats true  sam i make them all very skinny notwellnourished lizard people except for me  im pretty big  matt you now have a cluster as gilmore begins his incantation for the invisibility spell for  him vax and vex you guys all watch as each of your forms become these emaciated lizardfolk  except for scanlan who is this much shorter but wolverinestockylooking lizardman  sam its a glandular problem  mary its the mayonnaise  matt you hear gilmore chuckle midincantation chanting youre ridiculous 
none	 chanting he  finishes the incantation and gilmore vex and vax vanish  liam cant see us motherfucker  taliesin i suppose the invisible people will lead the way  sam lets go  will who knows where theyre going  laura we do we all followed garthok  will okay can we see the invisible people  matt no  will then how the fuck are we going to follow you  taliesin we also know  matt you guys begin to make your way through out of the alley  laura i tug on kashs little braid behind 
town	 him  will aw come on i hate that  matt you guys make your way into the street out of the alleyway it doesnt take you long to find  an entrance to the sewer you do occasionally hear the distant ominous wing flapping of a wyvern  rider or two doing a pass over this portion of the city a lot of the buildings on the outskirts have  been damaged even further from last time you were here a number of the buildings have doors torn off the  hinges signs of struggle on the outside it 
town	 takes you only a couple of minutes before you find a  grate a drainage runoff for rain in the city that leads into a subterranean sewer system it is a little  bit out in the open its between two buildings but right on the cusp of the street itself so  youll have to be quick about it  mary lets go  will whos opening it  liam i am  taliesin invisible person opens it and then somebody invisible keeps watch  laura im keeping watch  liam im checking for traps just in case natural 
none	 20  matt that grate is so not trapped like holy shit  liam its brand new  matt no ones ever trapped it yeah man you could sell that like it was day one  liam i lick it theres nothing it tastes clean  matt no it tastes sweet actually  liam all right is it locked  matt its not locked its wedged a little bit in there  laura grog help lift  will quietly  laura stealthily  matt okay shh he walks over and reaches as youre down there he walks over not seeing 
none	  you reaches on each side of you to get to the grate are you going to try to get out of the way  liam yeah ill roll out of there it seemed like you had a little story you wanted to tell yeah i  roll out of there  matt you dart out just as he lifts it off you hear the creaking of metal the bars bend slightly as  the strength imparted by the titanstone gauntlets cause him to easily pry this thing off the ground  you can see there is a somewhat eroded 
none	 ladder set of rungs but it is functional  liam how far down with darkvision  matt about 20 feet it seems to open into a chamber or sewer system  liam i spank him on the ass and say im going in follow me i drop in  laura wait grog put the grate down very quietly i whisper in his ear  liam on tiptoes standing on his knee  matt you guys all head down there with pike in tow gilmore following invisible  laura once were down in there i bamf trinket out of the necklace 
dung	  mary i use beast speech how are you trinket its been a long time  matt yes im scared  mary dont worry you know vex loves you very much  matt its why im here  laura i love you very much  mary well look out for you darling we will thank you for coming and helping us thank you  laura and for being such a badass  matt grunts smells weird  mary kiss him on his  matt its cold its damp  mary i love him  matt you guys continue up the 
none	 sewer system its been a dry spell for a month at least it hasnt  rained in the past couple of weeks it rains fairly often here so the system itself doesnt  have a lot of drainage going through thatll change soon im sure  liam im 40 feet ahead the whole time  matt make a perception check  liam 22  matt okay about ten more minutes into travel youre starting to get fairly close to game time  when things begin you do hear some whispers up ahead  liam hold on vex  matt it 
none	 sounds like four different voices are all conversing  laura i creep up next to him  liam in one location  matt a little ways ahead out of sight youre not sure of the source its echoing from ahead  liam listen with me  laura what are they saying  matt roll a perception check  laura im going to roll the critical role dice oh man oh good that was good  will there was a second where you thought it wasnt going to be good  laura wheres my piece of paper perception that is a 
none	 28  matt so while you hear the whispers its too distant for you vax to make out the details  vex as you hone in your ranger attentiveness youve studied lipmovement youve read lips so  much to the point where any disenunciation you can fill in the gaps the conversation sounds  like bits are talking about the relocation of people timing its too dangerous we have to  move further west the tunnels are down now now now and you hear a bunch of footfalls  laura running away from us  matt running in a direction 
none	 you cant make out if its towards or away right now in this moment  liam do we pop out now and talk to them  matt you now see what looks to be seven figures step into the center of the walkway where you are  walking away from you in the direction you were traveling  will is anybody still invisible andor lizards  matt you are all still lizards and three of you are invisible  laura and theyre heading towards us  matt theyre heading away from you in the direction you were going  laura 
none	 okay  liam wait if i go  laura they hate you  liam wait  matt three of them stop and turn wait shh its really quiet theyve all just stopped  laura are you true to emon  matt stillness no movement one of them goes and pulls a blade out very quietly  liam i used to be one of you i used to be clasp  laura and then i took an arrow to the knee  laughter  taliesin that may be the funniest thats ever been  liam so fucking meta  laughter  
none	 taliesin joke has been waiting for years  marisha yeah whats up 2014  laura remastered  matt you made it funny again  liam shes in the game  sam are you invisible  laura yeah were still invisible  taliesin were friends of garthak  laura garthok  taliesin garthok  laura youre invisible and youre far back  matt also all the figures that were stopped are slowly crawling in your direction and one of them  goes its lizardmen turn away  laura its not lizardmen magic  liam its a ruse  matt make a 
none	 persuasion check with disadvantage  laura oh no  matt because youre two voices coming out of the ether right now they just see a cluster of  lizards in the shadows and voices going no were okay  laughter  will were not lizards  matt dont worry guys  laura i rolled a 20 and a one  marisha shut up  liam also one  marisha you also rolled a one you both rolled fucking ones  liam cacaw look over here  matt the one in the front goes shit we have to close it run

none	 30 feet  matt yes they are  liam i shout out after them i know garthok hell recognize me  marisha he also kind of hates us i think  liam dont care  matt the mm double one man  liam okay okay  matt yeah no theyre still running theyre still running  laura were still running after them  matt okay you guys follow them for the next ten minutes or so and youre roughly ten minutes from  sundown game time before you hear a door slam ahead of you  liam i want to 
none	 move to that door  marisha i immediately stop and start looking behind me does this look like we just ran into a trap  matt make a perception check well this would be more of an investigation  liam are they catching up behind  matt yeah  marisha okay 21 total  liam im checking the door too  matt okay looking around its hard to see the sewer has slowly given way to a nonsewage tunnel  system that looks like it has existed for a long time this is reminiscent of some elements of the  
none	 clasps tunnel system that youve seen before though you havent really been to it this far  south in the city  marisha okay i stand back before i run in with the rest of them i dont want to get us all in a  corridor  mary can we investigate the door  liam i rolled a 28  matt hes currently doing that right now you rolled a 20  laura i like that youre talking to matt through the earring  liam im not talking to matt im  laughter  liam laura bailey busting my 
none	 balls since 2000 and something every chance she gets but she  loves me with all her heart  laughter  liam dont touch me 28 support you left and right and this is the thanks i get  matt the door is locked and the door is trapped  liam scanlan will you come up here please ive got my hand on my earlobe for a fucking reason  sam im here what do you need  liam i need you to talk us into this fucking doorway  sam for what are we still trying to get this 
none	 clasp ten minutes has gone by all right great  liam talk to the fuckers on the other side of this door you can talk to anybody  sam i knock knock knock on the door and i say oi i know you can hear me in there sorry for the  scare were friends and were here to help you get a lot of gold  matt make a persuasion check with disadvantage  sam because its through a door  matt and because they  marisha because were assholes  taliesin you should try and sell them drugs 
none	 i think that would go well  laura oh sell them drugs  sam 28  matt i can guarantee you they dont have any  taliesin no hes got them he can sell them off  matt theyre the clasp  liam theyre straightedge i know  matt oh totally  will you still dont know if you put it up your ass or smoke it how are you gonna sell it  sam ill find out from them  matt theres a pause and then a voice comes through and says so who are you what do you 
none	  want what leaves you the possibility of wandering these sewers unstabbed  sam first of all you or members of your organization know us we are from emon we are  emonites emonies were locals weve traveled these sewers before among you and we will again  tonight if you help us find our way to thordak we are superpowerful superheroes who are gonna kill  a dragon and give you half the gold  laura half the gold half the gold holy  matt theres another pause ten 20 seconds 30 seconds then you hear a winch go 
none	 clacking tink  then you hear door opening sound and the door just ever faintly opens and just a single  face pokes through hood up so youre allies against the dragon  taliesin absolutely  matt how many are you  sam well  laughter  sam about a half dozen lets say  taliesin twice a half a dozen  laura i think 12ish  sam ten ten some are animals some are invisible six to 12  matt we stand 30 strong in this room crossbows drawn make no mistakes we will be watching you  one 
none	 false move youll all have a bolt in the back of the skull walk with us well see if what you  say is true  liam i use thieves cant to knock out the phrase no bullshit on the door  matt you see his chin move and grind for a moment  sam i did that with my penis  laughter  matt make a deception check  laughter  mary he thinks youre cute  sam 20  matt 20  laura i like that he goes and its a 20  matt yeah laughs you see 
dung	 him go and slowly back away the door opens wider and as you enter  the room you can see theres roughly 30 people in various dark bits of dress the clasp had a uniform  or at least a uniform style to them when they were within their safe space while that still exists all  of them look tattered they look underfed they look sleepless and they all look driven and its  that cornered animal look that both is welcoming and also a little scary and as you all walk in  they all very intently keep 
none	 their eyes on you their crossbows at their side theyre all  surveying you and taking in and you can definitely see them accepting that you are  powerful in comparison to maybe many of the others that theyve encountered and that also scares  them it would be like good fuck at the same time and as you all walk in in this sullen  atmosphere the one that was talking to you pulls his hood back and you see its a younger man  probably in his late 20s but his face is just currently wrecked by some 
town	 sort of a disease thats  just scarred over  liam where is shenn  matt you want us to take you to shenn  laura no  taliesin theres no time to be honest  liam where is he  matt sighs hes probably by the volcanic pocket looks to me at least from the word on  the street theres something going on somethings going to be happening tonight and the  clasp is getting ready  will yeah weve got about ten minutes until all hell breaks loose so if weve got to do this  weve 
none	 got to do this now  laura weve got to get to where thordak is  mary is he by this volcanic surge  matt that he is sighs travel fast travel light follow me puts his hood back up and goes  into a run  will go running  mary naruto  matt you guys all gave chase at this point as fast as you can poor pike is like panting  laura grog picks her up come on  matt grog picks her up as he does and shes still like running in the air before whoa 
none	  okay thanks and puts her on his shoulders and theyre running together pike has to duck low a  couple of times as she almost gets her head knocked off on the low bridge area following him  as fast you can its around the corner down low corners hes quick and you can see why certain  people within the clasp rise quickly in that messenger format is they can get around the city  like that you begin to get to a point where you see a few grates up above you passing 20 feet  up 
none	 you start to see more and more sewer openings and you hear in the distance the sound of cracking  thunder  mary whispers the storms coming  sam as soon as we get out keyleth you have to make a storm or something  marisha yeah  sam or a vm or something right  laura she can probably do it through the grates  sam okay hurricane  matt as you continue to run you can hear up above too what sounds like just the energy  itself is gathering into a loud cacophony of screeches and roars 
none	 it sounds like the populace  that is keeping guard over the currently ruled tyrannically held city the wyverns are restless  they see something happening theres something brewing and now not just those below understand  but those above are starting to get the sense that things are not right its beginning you begin to  feel and hear bits of rainfall beginning to come through the grates just up ahead the little bit  of light that peeks through you can see the droplets now hitting as you run past overhead  you hear another bolt of lightning 
none	 and thunder in the distance and another lightning crack the  storm is getting faster and more successive and its definitely landed in emon you continue to  push forward  mary how far are we  matt you shouting ahead of  mary how much longer  matt you feel that  mary yes  matt no do you feel that and you start to realize as cold as it is up there as it has been  in the past these tunnels are growing warmer and warmer and warmer were not far now and hes  still running 
none	  laura as im running im dipping arrows in poison  matt okay  laura ive got six  matt okay so go ahead and mark those  laura six vials of poison so that makes six arrows or does that make  matt each vial can make three poisoned arrows  laura three however many i can make during this amount of time because i know it only lasts  for an hour so on the tips  matt so per vial is three hours  laura awesome  matt its hard to do while running at this fast 
none	 pace so id say you could get maybe two vials done to be  honest because in order to keep up its a full sprint youre racing against time for this its  like running as hard as you can and like  laughter  matt its a little hard  laura its one of those things i meant to do earlier  sam just got to finish knitting this sweater  laughter  matt eventually you begin watching as these tunnels you see collapsed portions of it you see  the falling rocks that are gathered you feel the 
dung	 air itself become humid become temperate and  uncomfortably warm the sweat begins to drip down your brow and what you recall being the dry heat  of the marquet deserts is now being matched or exceeded by the wet damp humid underground air  of the subterranean tunnels of emon you dart around the corner and follow him around this  curve and its the first time you see a break in the rock where a vibrant bright orange stream of  molten rock is now pouring down past into some basin below the walkway and you see him 
none	 more  carefully walk around it and now this pathway has gone from an original clasp tunnel to  essentially a haphazardly carved or left over and barely functional tunnel that has been wrecked by  this slow incursion of volcanic activity you have about two more minutes of running before he comes  to a stop and you hear now what initially was just the rousing of local lizard creatures and  denizens of emon the nowruling class the lightning is every few seconds and you hear one  loud ominous rumbling roar echo through the sky and its 
none	 a familiar roar you heard it once  before the fall of emon the storm has awakened or at least got the attention of the beast the  tyrant that now resides over the city of emon and he is not that far from where you stand the  young man pulls his hood back again and points up and you can see that theres one tunnel that leads  up out of the sewer part of it is jutting outward and its a slippery pouring of rain now  just gliding off of it and slopping into mud on 
none	 the ground most of the rungs have been rent off or  fallen through the erosion or the impression of this tectonic shift in this localized area he  points up  this is the closest i can get you but i dont know how you want to climb good luck  and he turns around and darts back where you guys came from  mary so hes guiding us up and out  matt no hes gone  sam weve got to get up so wait theres a pipe to climb up  matt its a three fourfootwide tunnel 
none	 it used to go straight up but now parts of it are  ground cracks its a little crooked and some of the initial climbing rungs have eroded away  laura can we parkour up  matt certainly go ahead and make acrobatics checks both of you guys  mary can grog throw us up  marisha is there a grate ahead of us can i see the sky  matt there is but it doesnt it looks partially off  liam 33  laura 34  matt both of you guys in a networkedtwintype nearballet in its execution darting 
none	 up in  tandem both using each other to push off as you hit each edge you make your way to the very top  in this crisscross fashion then one of you gets up just in time to hit the grate as the other one  hits the other side sending it onto the ground outside  liam perception check for anything nearby  laura by the way i was totally going to say i was putting trinket back in the necklace before  you started saying all that i was just it went into it right away

none	 them that the rain is attempting to put out  but the fire is fighting back you vax see the same spread and off to the left of you a  familiar sight the cloudtop district wall and gates maybe a couple hundred feet off from  your current position you can see beyond that just a singular black column of smoke with the  occasional flicker of red embers just drifting up through fighting against the storm itself the  rain may fall but it doesnt seem to last long enough to hit the ground of the cloudtop you 
dung	 see  mist and steam begin to rise up the rain is evaporating before it can even get close you also  see above the gate what looks to be a few dozen small dark shapes you take a moment to focus  before you can see what looks to be what were once people are now blackened husks that have been  left up on chains decoration if you will for the outside of the cloudtop its a warning or a  celebration of thordaks rule you see on the outside of that gate two large armored alert  
town	 fire giants wielding long thick square black metal blades that themselves have flames  engulfing and they are both standing there just shoulder to shoulder looking about on high alert  based on the current chaos of the circumstance  liam whats between us and them  matt its road its just bare road you have buildings to each side youre just now emerging  from the alleyway and you are in the center of the street right now  liam how far are they from us right now  matt theyre a little over a hundred feet  sam

none	 picking up and  beginning to swirl you watch as theyre having a hard time flying and being harried by the  elements just darting around and slamming into them one of the fire giants sees movement over  in your direction speaks in giant and starts walking that way as you begin to emerge in your  lizardperson form  sam can i quietly inspire kash  matt you can if you like  sam singing kash king of the universe kash ahah he is the best of us  will singing and his hair was parted in the 
none	 middle  laughter  matt take your d12 inspiration die  will wheres my d12  mary you just hold on to it  will my gosh oh yeah im just holding it  laughter  matt so as you walk forward and lift your hands up clutching the staff you watch as these black  ethereal tentacles burst out of the ground slam into the ground and attempt to wrap around the legs  and lower body of these giants what is your spell dc  sam its been a while since shes played guys  mary 18  
none	 matt 18 all right the fire giant oh nope a two and a three on their dex save  cheering  matt all right yeah so theyre both restrained and they take 3d6 bludgeoning damage if you  want to go ahead and roll that  mary 3d6 theyre restrained and its 3d6 bludgeoning damage which is ten  sam both of them you just restrained two fire giants holy shit  taliesin ten is on the good side of 3d6  matt you watch as it pulls them back their swords are held at bay their wrists are bound 
none	 by  these tentacles and both of them are being crushed by it and the other one no one here  speaks giant except for grog  will i speak giant  matt you do  matt you and grog hear it and it just says under attack in giant and as theyre both  being held there as youre holding them in place they take the damage what are the rest of you  guys doing  marisha i immediately right above us create a little eyeofthehurricane and you know when it  snows and theres a moonbow a 
none	 rainbow i do a little bit of a moonbow situation  laura okay are we trying to keep stealthed and then letting zarah and kash  sam i think we just go  taliesin were going to pass them  marisha and then we run  matt okay you guys all bolt towards the theres a 15foot gap between these two giants  right now and youre rushing across this like a doubledash you get just to them as it comes to  their go  laura i thought we were up and over the wall  sam no no 
dung	 we were out of the pipe  laura i understand  matt yes at this point as keyleth runs and creates this moonbow in this clearing in the sky  the wind suddenly doubles in speed in the air the bolts come down at twice the pace you watch  as rooftops are exploding you see wyverns being struck and thrown to the ground you see small  funnel clouds begin to form in portions of the city as the cloud itself is beginning to draw  and you start seeing a similar dark speck to what you saw in 
none	 the sky before coming to land before  you you see distant skysails flickering in and out of the storm control over this as this is  happening as you guys are running with that symbol you hear far to the left a large  explosion sound in the distance it sounded like an impact against a wall you get the sense that  it has begun you guys rush up to the edge of the door just as the two giants are going to attempt to break  free from the tentacles that is dexterity strength or dexterity check 
none	 against your save dc  so thats going to be helpful so strength is much better than the dex not with a three or a seven  im rolling as bad as i did on  mary stay right where you are boys  matt both of them just still locked in place they both try desperately staring down at you and  growling you can see the strain as the tentacles are pulling on them their swords burning  mary welcome to hentai  laughter  matt and youre keeping guard there at the ready what are you guys 
none	 doing youre at the door now  sam grog can grog punch through it i dont  matt yes i can and he goes for a full swing against the door yeah oh man okay  liam in grogs voice surprise gents  matt basically so thats doubledamage with siege to the door yeah that is just with his  fist not even using his axe just his fist against the door the first hit he dealt 26  points of bludgeoning damage for the second strike he brings up the axe now as he dented it  inward and 
none	 swings with it ooh thats 32 points of damage to the door you watch as the fist slams  between the doors and theyre large large heavy wooden doors youre very familiar with that have  metal reinforcements on them on this part of the gate the fist slam causes them to shudder at the impact  and shake but the chains still holding them in the inside are taut the axe comes by as it hits  the edge of the wood and the iron the wood splinters the iron bends and the hinges actually  impact off of 
none	 one and the gate slams off the side off the top hinge and you all have to try  to dart out of the way as it swings past oh man its not quite big enough to hit all of you  and i would say the ones thatre at the front line would probably be the twins and probably keyleth  youd want to stick with them well youd be back because of the storm cloud yeah and grog  definitely so the twins and grog i need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw  natural 20 
none	 for grog  cheering  liam would evasion work for this  laura 28  liam thats a dex save all right its just 20 with me  matt okay its fine you guys all duck out of the way as soon as the door slams into the mud to  the side the giants still restrained you all begin to charge into the space without thinking  as soon as the openings there you dart in as the giants are restrained and you guys what are you  doing at this point the giants arent going to be held 
none	 for long  mary kash  will can i cast geas on one and have one attack the other  mary swing away kash  will am i allowed to take control of one of them  matt oh i will see what the casting time is one minute so thats ten rounds that you have to  cast that spell its not much of a combat spell really  will because theyre flame giants right does a flame strike work on them or are they susceptible  to flames or no  matt that is up to what you 
none	 might expect  will then lets give it a try were going to try to do a 5thlevel flame strike and see what  happens  matt all righty go ahead and roll 4d6 radiant damage both restrained so they have disadvantage  on the save yeah no  will i also still have my inspiration too  sam it wont help here  will i know okay its okay yeah well no its awful i its 13 yeah 13  matt all right they both take 13 points of damage they take no fire damage theyre both  immune 
none	 to fire the flames do nothing but the radiant burst in itself does singe the exterior of  their bodies you see them rock with pain as the blast of light a column that shoots at them  bursts into them has taken effect not as much as you would have wanted but an effect nonetheless  you who are still maintaining concentration on this spell what do you want to do  mary what is the radius of witchbolt if i drop evards and hit theyre 15 feet apart from each  other  matt theyre 15 feet apart 
none	 from each other yes  mary i just dont know what the radius of witchbolt is can i hit both of them with it  matt with witchbolt with witchbolt as a  taliesin youd need a tenfoot radius to hit both of them  matt its going to be a tough call let me see witchbolt no no witchbolt hits one creature  mary only hits one creature  matt yeah you can still maintain a concentration spell and do instant spells if you wanted to  mary yes so then i will hold evards black tentacles and use 
none	 a cantrip of eldritch blast and  agonizing blast can i do that  matt yeah its part of the ability so yeah you can do that make three spell attack rolls  sam three spells shes so powerful  matt its all against one guy or its how are you splitting it up  mary im going to hit two on the left one on the right  matt two on the left one on the right okay go for it  matt your spell attack bonus is  mary plus 12 so 15 plus agonizing blast  matt 
none	 that only adds to damage  mary 15  matt so the first one you fire at it arcs past and hits the door behind hitting the  where the already damaged door  fell off the hinges  mary its 20  matt that hits go ahead and roll so youve hit one now roll for hitting the other  mary oh natural 20  matt okay so go ahead and your roll damage on that roll your d10 plus seven whats the first one  laura 2d10  matt no its 1d10 for the first roll next one

none	 twins from the giant  matt you guys just ran through into the  liam right through  laura we want to take sneak attacks on both of them  matt go for it  and five and a seven they cannot make their checks for shit  laura first one hits and then 21 does that hit  matt hits  laura okay do i get three attacks oh no no no im not clicking the boots yet  liam 21 so 21 hits  matt 21 hits yeah  laura augh whats happening  liam okay so the

none	 flames that were burning amidst the storm you watch as one of the flames leaps  out of the house and a number of other flames begin to rise up as living flaming entities that  are making their way towards you and you can quickly see that this is about to become  will awesome  matt awesome  laughter  matt but as you see vox machina running into the cloudtop district and disappearing into the  surrounding clouds and fume  will may the gods be with you  liam totally minor i didnt add my regular 
none	 bonus for dex and all that so add another eight to my  damage  matt okay got it  mary so theyre leaving  matt you got them in  mary go go well find you if we can in the meantime my love shall we have some fun  will lets do this thing baby  mary yeah  matt you guys hear the distant sounds of battle conflict inside the wall and far beyond you hear  in the distance the weird vibrating fuzzy echo of hundreds and hundreds of voices shouting in  unison the battles 
town	 upon emon however that moment quickly shifts as youre walking through  this volcanic fume the air itself is sulfurous and there are gouts of poison that spill forth  from cracked earth you can see points little bursts of glowing molten rock that break through  the surface and pour and then cool and create these small miniaturized volcanic spires you can  see the burned destroyed crumbled remnants of the buildings the noble houses the beautiful  mansions that used to make up the entirety of the cloudtop district the homes that youd look at  and think 
none	 god one day itd be great to live in something as beautiful as that reduced to ash  and cinder  your run slows as you begin to see this large crater wall that lifts up through the smoke a lip  that then vanishes over the edge where the smoke is pouring out like a thick column a slowmoving  stationary tornado of black that pours into the sky as you watch two large bulbous scaled red  arms shoot forth from the center as one long unfurling dragon neck rises up you see the red  crystalline brow 
none	 itself like jagged daggers of flame burst across the face as it rises up beyond  the smoke the teeth impossibly long and pointed for something of this size the eyes not red not  yellow but burning beams of pure white light like a small sun exists in each eye as it lifts  its whole form upwards out of the hole the wings unfurl the wind itself pushing all the smoke out  clearing the cloudtop for but an instant to see its massive swollen form you also notice that  within its chest this large thick scar 
none	 but no crystal just a large bulbous grownover thick  piece of scaled scar  as it stands towering above all of you peering over the distance not even noticing you at the  moment surveying the chaos around in emon its face drops and you hear this voice gurgle up from  within sourceless almost in its immensity in its encompassing nature it says  it appears that we have guests where are you  and thats where well end tonights episode  cheering and screaming  marisha can we all take a nervous swig of our fire resistance 
none	 potions like right now like glug glug glug  matt its to the instance where right now theres so much going on that thordak is having  this superman moment where he closes his eyes and hears all the screams in the city at once so you  dont know if he knows where you are yet or has seen you he just knows that somethings here and  thats where were going to pick up next session  liam doublefisting them gulp gulp  taliesin smoke em if you got em im going to vape im going to vape
