none	 matt hello everyone and welcome to the second episode  of critical role where a bunch of us  crazy voice actor nerdy types sit here  and play dungeons and dragons  well be continuing from last weeks adventure  so in the meantime lets go ahead and show you some  of the character backstory  travis right listen up  if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves  in his life combat women 
none	 and ale  record scratching  wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often  consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes colors  and shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded greataxe  grog oft enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks  of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome  in the woods he objected to the killing  of such an innocent life  a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this  chuckles this terrified little thing 
none	  his disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader  his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative  of the very gnome he fought to save saved him  it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns  to wrestling matches ha  or accompanying scanlan to the nearest 
none	 house  where you pay for lady favors huh  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth  would leave you with little information  on the halfelven druid  you might even think that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her  based on first impressions  lightning roaring  under that unintimidating petite frame  is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest  of champions pee their pants literally giggles 
none	  born to the air tribe of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature  and the elemental magics  it is her peoples inherent duty  to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begins to bleed  with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack  for air manipulation and beastshaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels  to be little beasts  which i do  clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the 
none	 headmaster of the tribe  her father kohren realized her true prodigious abilities  and she was inveterated to succeed him  as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leadertobe must embark on a journey  to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce  and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready he set her 
none	 on the path  to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if she will ever return  as she hikes down the mountain towards stillben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior  a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge one thought plays in repeat  in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third child  of seven children born to a noble family  who lived far to the north  in the ancient 
dung	 castle of whitestone  with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship  percy turned his attention  to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood  came to court  during a feast held in their honour the briarwoods  violently took control of the castle killing  or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed  by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men  as they ran percys sister 
none	 took several arrows  to the chest and fell  percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river  and floating unconscious to freedom  he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered the next two years  as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance  against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  gun clicking  explosion roaring  sam oh 
none	 you havent heard  of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise  and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much  as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm  and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin  and support his single mother  one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter  and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of 
town	 the world  and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite  come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion  while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex  deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing  hes never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first  performer second and fighter distant third  on the battlefield hell 
town	 support his allies  but rarely draws blood unless its  to protect fellow gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song  and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded  in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic  the judges and the 
none	 draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were  for how long i had been training  at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history  for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member  as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world  
none	 for months i would frequent the chamber  and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts  that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council  and was told that all of the information in the chamber  i stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction  or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed  to convince the city council to lend support  
town	 in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy  for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies  in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands  in that respect but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that mutters  i am much sharper 
none	 than most give me credit for  i just dont pay attention to things sometimes  ive also been known to be rather cunning loyal  happygolucky and well dangerous  i cant help but show my true scales every now and then  but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company  of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age  to skip past formality preferring instead  to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born  by a chance 
town	 encounter between elven royalty  and human peasantry  raised by their mother in their early years  the twins were eventually sent off to their father  in the elven capital of syngorn  but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last  the siblings stole away one autumn night  and set out on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided  to return to their mother and journeyed back  to the lands of their youth  but instead of 
none	 finding their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone their home burned to ash  pressing the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day the dragon came  loud roaring  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister  set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned  to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  sword slicing  the way 
none	 of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia  has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception  of a people who dont fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan  quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were 
none	 taken  from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father  was an ambassador  he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance  and after too many years of disdainful looks  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets  and learning the ways of the thief  while vex kept to the woods  she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt and 
none	 to track  to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion in the form of a bear  her own stolen trinket  bear growling  to fight alongside her  and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  welcome back everyone  so know that youre a little more affiliated  with the characters lets get this party started  so as a heads up i wanna let you know  once again were waiting for the charity elements  of this stream

town	 do that  matt yes but well be getting that going in the near future  so anyway  lets go ahead and do a little recap  of what happened last week  so the party has been hired by their friend  arcanist allura vysoren in the city of emon  to head towards the dwarven town of kraghammer  as a good friend of hers and one of the members  of the council of taldorei has gone missing  this being a halfling paladin named lady kima of vord  who was on a vision quest 
dung	 as part of a pilgrimage  and was drawn towards some dark evil  she said was manifesting somewhere deep beneath kraghammer  and hadnt been heard from since  so the party was sent there to go ahead and seek her  upon arriving in kraghammer shenanigans ensued  they made some friends made some enemies  wandered the town  brother sisters walked around as if they were married  laura no  group laughs  matt bears almost got into fights in rings  and eventually the party made their way  towards the bottom ring of 
none	 kraghammer proper  talking to lord nostoc greyspine who is  orion thats right greyspine  matt yes greyspine indeed  who is the head of the greyspine mines  at the bottom of kraghammer  where supposedly this paladin disappeared to  after having a conversation with him  a bunch of goblins and ogres began to spring from the mines  and attacking the workers  the party swooped down to aid realized that the goblins  and ogres werent attacking they were fleeing  from something else  of which emerging from within the mines proper  
none	 some strange nagabased hydraish abomination  the party then proceeded to slaughter it  final blow dealt by scanlan via lightning bolt  sam hi scanlan here hi  matt our resident gnome bard  travis yeah you did  matt and thats where we pick up  so as all of you are still riding the adrenaline  of the battle scanlan feeling the tingling in his fingers  as the little bolts of arcane energy kind of  imitates electricity crackling spark throughout  the rest of the nearby workers and miners  slowly converge in and begin 
town	 to  walk up to the party  and someone starts that was great that was well done  fantastic  whered you learn that  one of them comes up there ah i couldve done  better than that  and they start just shouting off at each other  and pat each other on the back  a few moments of this progresses before  all of a sudden theres a hush comes about the crowd  and you see about five or six carvers  pull their way through  carvers being the guards of kraghammer  
none	 with lord nostoc greyspine himself stepping through  he looks at the rest of the group and goes  all right so youve certainly proven yourselves in battle  orion well of course we have  im sorry  matt i would like to continue this conversation  that we had back in my office if you dont mind  he turns around and begins to walk back  marisha oh wait nostoc  hes not even listening hes just walking off  group laughs  yeah mmm  ooh shall we turn and follow  laura are you still 
none	 an eagle  can you even talk to him  taliesin shouldnt you just go caw  marisha well im not an eagle  but i am still poisoned  laura oh i can help you  marisha oh thatd be great  laura yeah  laura hold on im gonna go up and im gonna cast  sam cast  yeah i can cast spells  sam you can cast  laura i can ive got plenty o spells  liam you can kill  sam all right fair enough  laura im gonna cast protection from poison on 
none	 keyleth  matt okay  essentially go ahead and make a saving throw with advantage  thisll be constitution  marisha i made the second one  matt whatd you roll  marisha a 10  plus my constitution which is two three thirteen  matt so thirteen  marisha yes  matt thatd be enough  so after you finish casting the spell  you feel the poison leave the rest of your body  you can kind of take a breath to yourself  the rest of the miners kind of look about and  awkwardly staring back 
none	 at nostoc as he walks off  kind of looking back like what  are you gonna go  talk to him  sam yeah i guess we should go follow him  taliesin we have two very important questions  grog cant we look in the hole a little bit more  orion no grog we need to go do this  laura were gonna go in the hole in just a minute grog  orion then you can smash youll be fine  travis you promise  liam you did that last night  we need to take 
none	 care of business  lets go talk to the man  im sure its going to lead back to the mines  marisha to the hole  liam yes to the hole  everythings back to the hole  sam percy do you have something to say before we go  taliesin well this is good  we have to find out what that was  and we have to see if hell finally give us  some of that ale  i think are the two most important things  laura it was wine i believe  sam no 
dung	 it was bloody bloody beer  laura bloodline bloody wine blood wine  travis bloodier ale beerwine  matt it was delicious is what it was  travis it was really good  laura lets go talk to nostoc  sam lets follow him lets follow him  taliesin okay this is whats important  matt all right so as you head back to the ramp that heads up  from the mine enclosure itself to the top of the realm  which is where the greyspine industries mining facility is  you are brought into the building again  
none	 brought back to nostocs office  in which hes not sitting  hes kind of pacing behind his desk  waiting for you as you approach  as you enter the room he stops pacing turns around  puts his hand on the desk and says  please enter and close the doors behind you  loud thud  orion sorry i didnt mean to slam the door like that  group laughs  matt a flatulent dragonborn eh  group laughs  matt all right  so as you close the  laughs  tiberius  orion clears throat 
dung	 comically  sam sir greyspine  lord greyspine  mr greyspine  matt lord greyspine is fine  sam lord greyspine yes  why have you summoned us here  is it to tell us information about what just came out  of your mine i hope  matt well lets be clear  we dwarves dont need help from outsiders  we can handle our own business just fine  laura of course  marisha speaking of outsiders you wouldnt happen  to have seen a lady kima would you  matt as what the discussion was based on 
dung	 previously  youre searching for her and last we saw her  she went down into the mine  laura we already talked about that keyleth  travis yep we did  liam they dont like her she was a troublemaker  and she went in  travis youre an eagle  laura shes in the mine  well go in and find her  right  lord greyspine  matt youre welcome to  as far as i know shes down there somewhere  hopefully still in one piece  laura while were there would you like us to 
none	 take care  of any other problems  matt getting to that  you see these small intrusions have been bad  for meeting our quotas with the bronzegrip metal warehouse  and export shipments  employees have been forced to  collapse a nonnegotiable portion of our tunnels  to prevent incursions like this  without my approval  and this is a pattern i wish to stop at once  thus i have a proposition for you  now i will give you free reign to our mines  i shall get the proper approvals to make sure 
none	 no carvers  bother you as you wander the citys lower ring  and i will contract you to delve past our tunnels  and investigate the source of these creatures  where they come from where they live  and if there is some sort of a leader  who gives them their commands  eliminate them  for this i will reward you with not a trifle sum  25000 gold pieces  plus 250 gold per beast scalp you provide upon returning  laura ooh i like this  orion grog this seems like a wonderful job 
none	 doesnt it  sam money is wonderful  we like money  but weve been charged to find lady kima  we need assurances that we will find her  or at least some evidence of her in the mines  matt the brazen halfling bitch went in there  without my approval and wandered into the mines  not to be seen  so if she is down there i hope shes in one piece  i cant guarantee it  but if theres any place to find her thats probably it  liam were the group of adventurers 
none	 for you  i dont know if youve heard  of the heroes emon who just recently  im sure youve heard something  word travels fast  matt not beneath this mountain it doesnt  of human closers  liam weve just done a lot of good to the ruler of emon  matt great  how does that help us dwarves  orion were saying we are going to help you too  and everything will be fine and well all be happy  laura well weve discovered in our past adventures however  is that every realm 
none	  seems to be having trouble with the same sort of creatures  coming up from the underdark perhaps  liam all were saying is help us help you  what exactly have you seen before this day  more of the same or other creatures  matt he sits back for a second  the types of creatures i do not know  i mostly deal with the business  and just know that theres some bullshite going on  down in the mines  you could ask our foreman hieris  hes dealt with the cleanup each time 
dung	  weve had an incursion like this  so if anyone has information on what these creatures are  hed be the one to talk to  liam sorry what was his name again  matt sam laura hieris  matt hes a foreman at the mine proper  laura all right  taliesin i think this seems like the sort of job wed want to take  laura orion yes  travis will we get paid for the monsters and creatures  weve already slayed  matt this deal was not sewn in yet so no  travis oh 
none	  matt but we thank you for your aid  percy it is customary in our culture to seal a deal  with a drink  taliesin as i think you are all aware  laura truly truly  liam see i wasnt just fucking with you last week  group laughs  thats a thing we do  taliesin and since we are about to risk our lives  travis i forgot you did that  matt make a persuasion roll  taliesin yes happily  travis roll good its the first one  liam come on percy  
none	 taliesin 14  laura oh  sam its pretty good  not great  matt you can see this long distant angry dwarven  mistrusting stare  rubs his chin his wellkept blackened beard and goes  huh but a sip as it was a gift  laura yes  sam laughs well take it  he pulls the ale barrel which you guys provided  sets it on the side of his desk with the same spigot  that you had placed in when you presented it earlier  and says take a bit  a bit  laura 
none	 whispering put some in a bottle  orion we have to save some for those guards  liam let me take care of it  ill pour everyone a glass  liam oh thank you brother  i take my empty water flask that i emptied out before  and am smiling and pouring glasses  and also squirting a little bit here and there as i want  i start to just play a little ditty on the flute  i thought we could accompany our sip with a little bit  of music not to distract you just 
none	 to  group laughs  just to sort of accompany us  matt his nose squints at the sound  sam imitates a jaunty flute  matt gnomish tunes arent to my ears and liking  however you do get an inspiration dice  laura yay  matt all right so go ahead and make a  laughs  make a sleight of hand check on this  liam okay  thats what we do right  laura roll well  here we go  laura and liam oh no  sam you have inspiration dice  taliesin inspiration dice 
none	 are d8  matt yep you add a d8 to it as well  liam okay and i can add a d8 to this  matt correct  taliesin the ale is that good  liam oh good  now im at 19  travis groans in relief  hey  matt as hes listening to the gnomish music  and kind of pushing it away with his hands like  stop i dont no  i appreciate it but i dont  sam all right theres not accounting for taste  matt as you do that your wineskin goes 
none	 to full  imitates liquid sloshing  swollen to its brim  you switch over to one of the cups  you pass around the drinks  all of you manage to get your drinks passed around  laura huzzah  matt to a contract  travis aye huzzah  taliesin to a contract  marisha contracts  sam lchaim  marisha love contracts  liam is that draconian  sam its gnomish  taliesin to risking our lives for money  laura how old is nostoc  just out of curiosity  matt its hard to tell  dwarves 
tavern	 live quite a long time  he would be equivalent to like a human forties  dwarven time somewhere in his midhundreds  marisha smells like its been in the barrel for a hundred years  orion it has been  laura this is excellent  liam tastes like two buck chuck  group laughs  orion oh i know him from quimdendale  travis what do you know of a ballsac up in the tavern  matt im sorry what  travis do i have that right  laura ball ball   marisha balgus  group balgus  
none	 matt ah balgus thats the brand of what you brought me  sam you know what i think we asked about him last time  laura i think we did  orion also may we take a short rest  before we leave this facility  marisha yes could we do that  is this considered a short rest  laura oh yeah that actually would be good  matt if youd like to do that  that would just be taking a short rest outside  probably not in the office proper  laura understandable  matt you can 
none	 leave and just sit down  and get some rest  laura when we take a rest can i look for hieris  matt you can as well  so while you guys are taking a short rest  youre able to use any of your hit dice  to heal up naturally  travis we dont naturally heal up  matt that is your natural healing  not to full  its a continuation grog  sam i will sing a song of rest  and it goes a little something like  ♫ scanlan make you feel good 
none	 ♫  ♫ scanlan make you feel real good ♫  orion oh i feel so good  sam no wait you get an extra d6 on all your heals  travis i appreciate the slow jam  matt yeah on every hit dice you get an extra d6  travis r kelly would agree  matt laughs  laura i didnt take any hit points  im at full health  matt so you got a slow jam just for the sake of the slow jam  laura thats right and it was great  matt all right roll 
town	 an investigate check  orion it feels good real good  laura okay  oh 25  matt a brief discussion with a few  of the other wandering dwarf miners that are  in the outskirts of the buildings facilities  eventually it leads you over to what is a small  secondary building maybe 200 yards off  from the main property  that apparently is where hieris resides  and keeps watch over the entire establishment  liam ive tagged along  laura knock knock knock  matt all right the rest of you going with her 
none	  sam yeah well go with her  matt why not why split the party  so the the group makes their way over  to the outskirts of the building  opens up and a very nice  portly looking dwarf  with a big tuft of a chinstrap beard  big reddish ruddy nose  leather apron on  and he opens the door  aye hello  nice to meet you  what can i do for ye  laura hi you must be hieris  matt i am i am  foreman of this here fine 
dung	 mine  laura wonderful to meet you  ive heard wonderful things about you  matt oh have you from who  laura uh from lord greyspine himself  matt really oh all right  well how can i be of service  laura we were curious  im sure you witnessed all of those wonderful goblins  and trolls and other nonsense coming out of the mine  matt aye nasty lot  it always makes my weeks  that much more interesting  laura weeks so this has been happening for quite a while  matt unfortunately at 
none	 least five or six  laura and what kind of monsters have you been dealing with  matt terrible kinds  he starts rubbing his chin for a little and goes  we generally deal with the occasional goblin den  we stumble across when opening new tunnels  thats part of the norm  other nasty underground beasties  however over this past few weeks  weve seen some real nightmarish things slither  out of the shadows  many goblins stitched together  like some kind of ball of screaming green lint  sam ooh god  matt 
none	 slimes and oozes that would mutate  and change color rapidly before seeming to dissolve  on their own  unstablelooking really in their form  sam like a goblin centipede  laura liam travis laugh  matt if you will aye aye  orion sounds more like some type of necromancy magic  matt perhaps but theyre not undead per se  theyre still alive  at least from what we can tell  whatever agony face them in their physical form  orion oh thats even worse  matt we even had one brief runin with what looked 
dung	  like a duergar that had swollen and sprouted eyes  and mouths all across his body that was a sight  sam whats a duergar  liam thats a dark dwarf  theyre little fuckers those are  matt aye duergar  and he spits to the side  filthy lost souls  dwarves of old that turned to a darker god  thankfully they live far beneath the mountains  and usually far north enough to not worry about it  but one of them found its way up here  in this strange awful mawcovered form  
none	 it was terrifying  and the smell  oh ho ho  anyway weve even seen a few creatures from the surface  that normally arent found down here as well  which is strange  they dont wander down  somethings bringing them  weirdest thing  oh and i just heard we had some weird  manyheaded serpent thing that just got killed down there  laura oh we just killed one of those  matt that was you  laura yes  travis our hero is right over here  sam clears throat hi  group laughs 
none	  matt and he steps onto his back leg shifting his weight  and cocks an awkward eyebrow  really  sam im really strong for my age  orion we were all surprised  taliesin were as surprised as anybody  travis fearsome scanlan  sam actually hieris i have a question for you  you know the mines very well yes  matt aye i do  sam far from asking you to draw us a map  are there any tunnels or directions that we should avoid  or particularly head towards  anything that we should 
none	 look for in terms  of traps or tricks  matt not within our mines  theyre usually wellguarded or they were  orion also do you have a map  matt of the mines  yeah i do  orion wonderful  matt he starts going through his notes here  orion ill take that  sam thats where were going right  travis were goin in the hole  matt its kinda haphazardly scrawled across a piece  of parchment but he hands it over to you  matt and he says so thats the front part of 
dung	 the mines  unfortunately half of our tunnels have been  relinquished to close off some of these beasties  coming through so were gonna have to recarve portions  of the mine as we progress forward  kind of starting at square one best we can  but that at least is what were currently working with  there is a subterranean level as well  we have an elevator inside  that brings the various mine carts to and from  laura is there a particular area on that map  that most of the baddies seem to 
none	 be coming from  matt no weve closed it off each time  laura just kind of everywhere  matt oh no weve had a few tunnels theyve come through  but weve managed to collapse those  and make sure theyre not coming through again  liam and we noticed the i believed it was the naga we fought  it seemed to have several extra heads stitched on  have you no knowledge of these creatures  it seems very odd  is there any connection in dwarven history or past  or this is totally out of 
none	 the blue  matt no no not to my knowledge at least  i mean most beasts we find are in one piece  not several together  its a bit disturbing to be honest  i told my nephew about it and he was crying for hours  laura and marisha oh  orion laughs  travis do any of the beasts go back into them  matt oh no weve killed them as they come out each time  right they dont take anything back  matt not from what ive seen no  marisha hieris do you 
dung	 know if theres any other entrances  into the mine  any old secret tunnels something that someone  could be using to get in  matt not to the mine this is all proprietary  this is the business we run so we dont have any internal  or secret entrances  that would leave us open to a sort of a thief  to come in and steal our mithril  liam and whats security like on the mine  is there any chance someone couldve slipped in  through kraghammer without you knowing  or is that 
none	 all locked up  matt oh i highly doubt that not with  the way our carvers are trained  liam understood understood  laura they are quite  matt thats what im talking about  laura yeah  matt fine dwarven study  travis before we go  laura strong ale  matt finest of military classes aye  proud of em  travis what do you use for the  matt i had a cousin who was once a carver  raised him there  his whole family brought him up on that side  military weapon training 
none	 every day  couldnt come out and play with the rest of us  i felt bad for him  but he grew up to be a right nasty dwarf aye  liam you say had  laura where is he now  matt unfortunately he was slain in one of the incursions  that duergar i was telling you about  but such is the nature of the fighter i suppose  laura a damn shame  im so sorry  matt i appreciate that  to be honest he was kind of a bastard but um  dont

none	  with these blue pointed crystals on top  of each tower  liam how does the grass grow down here  laura can we see any traps or glyphs that are active  matt he points out to you as you approach  there are a series of stone sigils carved into the stonework  that surrounds the exterior of the lawn  orion those things  laura can we look around and see if theres any way to  a bell to ring thats outside of that area  matt go ahead and make a perception check  
none	 taliesin can i assist on that  laura yeah please do cause i rolled a one  one baby  taliesin its a 10  laura i failed it hard i failed it  taliesin if you rolled a one theres nothing i can do anyway  matt whatd you roll  liam we aint found shit  travis she rolled a one  matt rolled a one naturally  laura i did  matt best you can tell stoneworks pretty solid  laura cool  hey its a house  matt yeah  matt there are dwarves around no 
none	  travis good  matt as you look about its hard to tell the nature  this looks just like a lawn  with a wellframed stone exterior  laura cool  matt but theres no fence  theres nothing keeping you from walking  into the lawn and towards the building  marisha can i do a nature check to see what light source  is making all this grass grow  or if its like magical growing  matt no nature check required  there is no light source other than the green rocks  that generally permeate 
none	 the interior of kraghammer  to give its kind of strange luminescent atmosphere  this kind of dull red glow thats around the entire city  other than a couple of sparks of lantern light  theres no light source  sam i wonder what keyleth is doing  shes squeaking an awful lot  marisha imitates squirrel  laura oh thats right shes in my pocket  hi  travis so we just walk up and  laura can i pet her little head  orion no i dont suggest that grog  i shoot firebolt  matt i 
none	 forgot that wasnt water coughs  taliesin did you actually try to walk up  liam is there a front door  taliesin perhaps you should before you do anything just try and walk up  matt from what you can see  there appears to be a large almost like beachwood  light wood double door in the front of the compound  laura grogs gonna go  liam im gonna use my rogue abilities to walk up  to the front door and knock on it  orion great  laura sorry grog  travis i have one 
none	 job to take damage  liam can i see if i detect a bell  marisha is that a talent you picked is that a feat  matt so you walk towards the grass  you step onto the walkway that leads  towards the front of the building  as soon as you cross into the threshold  where those stone sigils are  you make a dexterity saving throw  travis laughs  laura oh no  roll well my brother  liam this is really not good for their business  liam and laura groan  group 
none	 laughs  liam 12  matt 12  laura oh no  matt so as you pull your cloak around you and take a few steps  to jaunt upwards suddenly theres you guys hear it  the strange tongue clicking sound  and a poof poof of arcane blue energy kind of  just pulses around his feet  you instinctively begin to pull back but as you do  theres a blast of blue electric energy  that imitates explosion  streaks out from all around you shocking your body  and throwing you about 15 feet back 
none	  straight onto your shoulders  you imitates grinding skid to a halt imitates thud  liam which one of these do i roll for damage  travis electrified sound effect  matt you take  liam higigigigi  matt 14 points of lightning damage  liam all right  orion this is as im paused telling him not to do that  matt yes  orion dont  travis shouldve let me go  matt your muscles eventually relax  orion as i was about to say that was going to happen  travis we have a flying carpet

none	 60 feet so yeah  you go ahead and you walk up to where that sigil is  you finish your spell you cast unseen servant  sam ♫ unseen servant ho ♫  group laughs  matt which he says every time  sam yes  matt every single time  you see this strange shift of air  as some sort of humanoid form then materializes  in the opposite side of this boundary  and stands at your ready and command  sam we still havent knocked on the door correct  group no  matt its 
none	 about a 60 foot walk  sam i command the unseen servant to imitates knocking  matt it kind of saunters over  you guys see this kind of shifting  barely barely visible form make its way  up to the front door  in the distance you hear a dull knocking  eventually the door slightly opens  and you see a hunched figure  with bright white chalkwhite hair  kind of look out the doorway  oh wheres he come from  looking at the form in front of him  sam oh the ghost  
none	 matt yeah  thats where you come from  all right  sam hello  orion im waving  hello  matt opens the door comes out  you now see this dwarven figure hunched very very old  with a long very very wellcrafted brass staff  looks like a black or purple gem at the top  spectacles at the tip of its nose  and it begins to kind of shift its way over towards you  breathes heavily  orion watch out for that rune  its still on  sam i think he knows that 
none	  laughing  matt eventually making its way  travis hes coming towards us  matt yes walks right to the edge of the sigil  puts his hand up and the unseen servant vanishes  he goes so you have my attention  orion well its a pleasure to meet you  my names tiberius stormwind and these are my friends  matt he puts his hand up and theres no sound  coming out of your mouth  travis laughs  sam maybe we should listen  matt this is the one who wouldbe attacked our home abode

dung	 where we have to go slaughter a bunch of nasties  in apparently one of your mines  and we dont know the source  and it appears to be of an extreme arcane nature  of the dark sense and i figured we could come to you  for help and some kind of guidance  and i will scanlan will you stop it  and it appears that you very well know something  that we could learn from with all due respect of course  matt make a persuasion check  marisha holy shit what the fuck

none	 make your way  down to the bottom ring of kraghammer  to the mines proper  the miners have gone back to work  and from what you can see  theres just an all around crazy business  with people cleaning out still trying  to clean out the ichor thats on the ground  left over from the battle you guys had the day before  you make your way  to the front of the mines  and immediately three of the carvers that are standing  at the front approach as you begin to walk 
none	  and then upon noticing you kind of like  step back and put their weapons to the side  travis yep  matt acknowledging the orders they received  from lord greyspine  laura oh trinkets with us  matt trinket has come along with you  sam trinket the bear trinket the bear  laura i just saw that dont forget trinket  i didnt forget trinket  matt i assume trinket comes with you unless you say otherwise  matt in general  travis are they especially bowing to scanlan the snake slayer  matt laughs  
dung	 no  group laughs  travis no love  matt theyre busy working  matt and fair play to the gnome but theyre dwarves  sam sure  orion yeah  they see that crap all the time  matt you make your way into the mine proper  it goes back for a good 10 minutes of walking  and of winding  you can see the actual track  of the minetrack leading around  you come upon a couple of dwarves that  look over their shoulders begrudgingly at you guys  as you pass going hey 
dung	  eh shh and go right back into mining whatever remains  in the inside of this  it looks like this portion of the mine  has been nearly picked clean  the dwarves that are in there are probably just wasting time  to get their pay for the day  you go further back and eventually it opens up  i think i have the map available  liam ive got it right here  sam its over there  matt cool  sam can you put it so that the people can see  laura oh 
dung	 yeah  sam is that a thing  travis they cant see that  matt we can put it on there perhaps  for the most part ill be describing it as you go  so its not too important  laura okay  taliesin looks like italy  matt yes  travis its a boot  marisha its the boot yeah  matt following it you get to a portion of the mine  that is very busy  you can see since this is probably one of the portions  that wasnt collapsed in previous incursions  buy 
none	 whatever creatures these were  you get the feeling that this one has basically taken  most of their workforce to try and find  and carve a new vein  or find a new path to pull things from  you get towards the portion  where all these dwarves are working  and you notice that some of the doors have been shattered  knocked off the hinges  you imagine whatever creatures  were barreling through before  this is probably where they came through  laura all right  taliesin thats where were going  travis 
none	 make an arcane check somebody with arcane  laura oh yeah can i look around  perception  matt you look around  what are you looking for  laura im looking for you know  group laughs  travis be specific  taliesin 15 arcana check  laura scratch marks for anything  marisha i like the idea of magic perception  taliesin i just wanna see if theres anything familiar  about the markings if i can identify  any signs of something mystical thats come through here  travis like a portal or a prison or a 
none	  matt thatd be more of an investigation roll  taliesin oh well alright  laura im gonna look for tracks  matt okay  thatll be an investigation roll for you as well  marisha im gonna assist her look for animal tracks  laura im scared i dont know which one to roll  both my die have been rolling so bad  orion i want to detect magic for a while  matt all right  loud thud  matt aid roll keyleth  laura this one is no longer in service  taliesin oh wow  
dung	 marisha five  travis well hers is a lot better  marisha good  liam sorry ive got the map so im looking at the mine  are we still in the dwarven carved out  sort of structure portion of the mine  matt you are  you have just essentially started on that map  sam so lets go down  liam guys im holding a map  i see one room that theyve scrawled supply on  so it should be the next right up ahead  id like to just take a peek in there  
none	 and see what we can see before we head deeper in  matt all right you are  laura i rolled a one again  matt a natural one  laura a natural one  vax and i get dressed up in sherlock holmes cosplay  and we say golly gee i think i see some animal tracks  over here  taliesin they are staring at their own footprints on the ground  marisha the trails going cold  taliesin following around in a circle  matt oh man this has turned completely back  from the first game 
none	  you guys are failing consistently  laura everything  matt lets turn this around lets turn this around  liam anyhow ive got a map so lets use this  stay on point here  matt you make your way  towards the supply room as you  head to where it was  one of the dwarves is guarding it  not a carver just one of the miners that was hired  for this purpose is standing there  leads you into the door kind of opening it for you  awkwardly going all right whatever youre 
dung	 looking for fine  go inside  looking inside there are just racks and racks and racks  of pickaxes shovels utensils for the purpose of mining  and constructing  there are wooden boards lying down  there are just giant barrels of nails and clipping utensils  and things that are used in the continuous expansion  of a mine  liam ive seen enough  we should keep going  group laughs  this map says that theres an elevator  a short ways up laura that goes down  liam that goes down  but then 
none	 theres a railway that goes further in  into the caves so im not sure  laura we should probably go down  marisha yeah i feel like going down liam elevator straight down  marisha lets go further all the way down  sam how many of us can the elevator hold  matt elevator can pretty much hold all of you guys  sam okay lets go  liam its a safe assumption that lady kima did not just  walk to the back of the upper floors  she probably went down  sam yeah lets go 
dung	 down come on  liam get shit done lets go  matt all right  laura lets do it  marisha get low  travis air high five  liam we have a map to the elevator  travis make 10  matt as you guys are walking over to where the elevator is  you do notice there are two places in the mines  where there is just large piles of rubble  and part of the ceiling has collapsed  you can see that there were portions  where the mine expanded much deeper into the mountain 
dung	  that were detonated or collapsed in the idea  of preventing any further incursion by  whatever these creatures are pouring through  you also can see that there are some dwarven corpses  being loaded out from the mine below  as well as goblin corpses  individuals that were caught in the attack  that happened yesterday before it managed  to emerge from the mine  liam scanlan are you all right around these goblin corpses  laura we should follow those  sam any goblin corpse is a good goblin i say  im fine 
dung	 with it  ill just quickly spit on their bodies  as they go by  matt and you do so quite quickly spits  its rapid its amazing  laura so we follow the corpses  and see where theyre coming from  matt all right so that heads away  from the elevator  sam no no no no no no  thats being taken to be buried lets just keep  laura no no no where  theyre coming from  sam oh  liam so we could either go to the rear of the mine  
none	 on this level and see where theyre coming from  laura i thought we already went downstairs  liam no not yet  matt theres a spiral staircase on the map  on the lower right hand side  liam yes i see it  matt thats where theyre coming from  laura does that lead down probably  matt it seems to  laura well then lets take the elevator whatever  lets go down  matt all right  travis you should put it under the thing  taliesin were good with down  matt you guys go 
dung	 ahead and approach the elevator  its a large wooden platform with a series of chains  my terrible hastily drawn map there for you  travis its kinda crap but its kinda great  matt yeah i know  it was actually more designed as a dm utensil  but you guys needed a map  travis i love it  matt so i gave you my map  travis there you go  laura take it back  matt so im taking it back  group laughs  orion give it to me  matt itsa mine  
none	 no im keeping it  its all right  so you get back to the elevator  theres a large 15 by 20 platform with a series of chains  and there are two dwarves in the back  that run a giant iron wheel  as you approach they kind of give you a look like  well are you serious about going down  travis laura and marisha yeah  matt okay step on the platform  laura lets do it  the two dwarves grab and begin to rotate the giant wheel  as it does you 
none	 here the winch and the chain begin to tighten  as it does  the platform shudders for a second  begins to lower  as it begins to lower you can feel the actual platform  shake a little bit as the whole weight  is placed on the chains  taliesin guys were on an elevator  marisha this is scary  orion i love elevators  matt as the winch begins to release it  laura i pet trinket calm him down  marisha ive never been on  one of these before  matt trinket is 
dung	 a little nervous  marisha its really tight  taliesin im on an elevator with a bear  marisha its really dark tight  orion oh light snaps  taliesin thank you  laura are we down yet  marisha keyleths getting a little claustrophobic  shes never been in this tight of a space  travis are you claustrophobic  matt as the light spell bursts out from his staff  you all kind of have to cover your eyes for a second  but the lower area is opened up  liam word of warning tiberius  laura 
dung	 can we see out  orion she said it was dark and then i cast my spell  travis yeah its what you do  matt imitates loud thudding you guys hit the bottom floor  you step off the platform and you can see  there is a secondary minecart that leads from this elevator  that curves to the left and leads deeper  into the mine proper  to the right of you is the spiral staircase  and you can see now two of the other miner dwarves  are dragging a dead body across  
none	 laura can i look for goblin tracks down here and follow those  matt laughs you can attempt another investigation check  sam why dont we just ask the dwarves  where they were getting the bodies  travis youre gonna roll crap youre gonna roll crap  laura dont curse me  marisha please dont do that  laura what am i what is it that i add it to  matt investigate  laura perception  matt investigate  but you advantage on the roll because youre a ranger tracking  laura oh sweet okay  sam why 
none	 dont we just ask  laura well thats good okay  lets go with a 17  matt 17 alright  so as you guys are going to ask somebody about this  your ranger gets down and begins inspecting the floor  laura yeah i see things  matt where you can see there were struggles  that apparently occurred  you can see slash marks on the ground  you can see bodies or the impacts of bodies  where some of these dwarves have been pulled away  a few minutes later you can see tracks  
none	 dwarven tracks of bodies being pulled and dragged  not in the direction theyre going  but further down the tunnel  travis yeah lets go there  laura oh no  matt as you look and follow that track  you notice that maybe a good 200 feet  to the left of the cavern there is a new tunnel breach  that is currently open  about a 20 by 15 size tunnel that is fresh and blasted out  from the other side  you can see rubble and rocks strewn across the floor  laura i 
dung	 hear i hear birds coming from the  travis its a fucking trip right  laura i know  sam lets go down there  lets go down where its dangerous  matt all right  laura can we see  travis can we ask one of the guards  taliesin its a mine canary  liam is it black or is it dim  matt with his light spell its fairly bright  travis nice  matt otherwise its fairly dim  travis i cup my hands over my face and go grog grog grog laughs  matt and 
dung	 it does echo  grog grog grog grog  laura why would you do that  travis why not  matt faintly groggrog grog  following the tracks you can see the dragging  of the bodies does indeed go in the direction  and into the newly carved tunnel  in this mine network  laura all right  matt what you do notice is the dwarves bodies  that are being dragged away  you can see footprints of those that are also  pulling them aside  you kind of figure out the idea of the pattern 
none	  of the footsteps that are leading in that direction  laura big small  matt most of them are also dwarven in shape  laura oh okay  marisha most of them  matt so there are you can gather  dwarven feet dragging dwarven bodies deeper inside  liam duergar  laura dwarven centipede  liam its the duergar  matt however there are two bodies that are being dragged  with no footprints whatsoever  travis what  laura wings  sam theyre being used like skateboards  group laughs  marisha legolas style  orion who 
none	 and what are those  liam this is 2015  travis is there any residue  marisha yeah  sam wow if only we had asked some dwarves  whats been going on down here  laura is there any residue blood  orion we already know  laura green red black  matt from the dragging marks there is no blood  theres no signs of them dragging dead bodies off at least  laura does it look like they struggled  matt no theres no struggle either  travis oh crap fire  marisha what about the walls 
dung	  how close are the walls  matt the walls here for this tunnel are  about 15 20 feet in width  and about 10 15 feet high  marisha are there any scratch marks or anything like that  on the walls  matt no  liam lets stop dicking around and go into that mine  travis taliesin yeah laura might as well  matt all right  travis we go further  matt you push further in  liam imitates sword being drawn  matt so this tunnel pitch black  theres no light source aside 
none	 from the one  that youre creating  you guys push forward  and push forward following the tracks  and push forward  and the the tunnel winds and winds and descends  and winds and descends  about two hours  laura marisha travis and sam what  matt of following this tunnel with little variation  laura shouldve grabbed some dried fruit  travis we got a ton  matt steadily declining and winding as it progresses  three hours go by  this tunnel goes extremely deep  whatever managed to dig its way up here 
dung	  came from pretty far under this mine  laura at no point does it look like the bodies ever moved  matt nope no change in physicality  no sign of struggle  marisha but there are the drag marks all the way matt yeah  liam and two hours ago  i started stealthing  and taking the lead  when were in the dark  matt all right go ahead and roll a stealth check  laura i thought i was tracking  liam uh 29  laura whoo thats a good roll  yay first good 
none	 roll of the night  matt all right there we go  your luck is changing now  laura changing it around  travis let me touch you  matt you feel pretty stealthy  you guys look like wait where the hell did vax go  marisha oh shit i hope he didnt hear me just say that about him  dammit  laura oh thank you brother  taliesin im having a serious tom sawyer island vibe  laura i found him  liam looks fine  matt about four hours  marisha are there any drafts  
none	 do i feel any wind flows or anything like that  matt no  it is still  it is stagnant air  laura coughs  even more stagnant now  four hours of traveling deeper into this tunnels path  until  laura anybody else have to go  to the bathroom  travis he rolled he rolled something  laura oh no he rolled  marisha and so that is how i spent my 12th birthday  sam great story keyleth  and yeah  marisha lets see what else  travis hey scanlan you kill me i 
dung	 kill you  liam there a great little cave alcove here  perfect for peeing in  laura oh brother good to see you  liam for everyone to pee  laura am i over here or am i over here  perhaps we could take a pee break here  and proceed further into the mines  marisha i agree with that  laura thats a good idea  liam do you catch my drift  matt as the four hour mark of travel  into this tunnel presents itself  the tunnel finally widens and opens  as 
none	 the sound of distant water rushing reaches your ears  laura oh no i have to go to the bathroom  matt as tiberius steps into this opening  the light cascades into this new cavern  a large beautiful open space presents itself  a good 100footup ceiling  from what you can see a roaring river is now  pouring out of the nearby rock cascading over a cliffside  into a waterfall down into this deeper  giant cavernous space  laura what about the tracks  matt the tracks continue in the direction of that river 
none	  marisha into the river  like it goes into the water  laura do we want to step  into the room fully  marisha why dont we send  laura im gonna stealth im gonna stealth too  marisha stealth twins  orion do i detect any magic  stealth twins 2015  matt you detect no magic  you roll stealth  laura 17  matt lets go ahead and take a bio break  laura okay  matt as the mystery begins to unveil  group laughs  orion i love a mystery  matt be

none	 at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history  for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise  of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world  for months i would frequent the chamber  and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i 
town	 made a list of artifacts  that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council  and was told that all of the information in the chamber  i stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction  or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed  to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy  for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town

none	 rather cunning loyal  happygolucky and well dangerous  i cant help but show my true scales every now and then  but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company  of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age  to skip past formality preferring instead  to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born  by a chance encounter between elven royalty  and human peasantry  raised by their mother in their early years the twins  were eventually 
town	 sent off to their father  in the elven capital of syngorn  but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last  the siblings stole away one autumn night  and set out on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually  decided to return to their mother  and journeyed back to the lands of their youth  but instead of finding their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone their home burned to ash 
none	  pressing the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day the dragon came  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister  set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned  to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  sword slicing  the way of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia  has spent most 
none	 of her life suffering the cool reception  of a people who dont fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan  quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken  from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father  was an ambassador  
none	 he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance  and after too many years of disdainful looks  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets  and learning the ways of the thief  while vex kept to the woods  she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned  to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion in the form of 
none	 a bear  her own stolen trinket  to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  producer and back to you  welcome back  thank you for waiting  weve all had our fill of snacks drinks  and relieving ourselves of the ones we had earlier  so before we return we actually want to thank you guys  for having all the subscriptions you have  since we started playing we hit a thousand very quickly  you guys are awesome  travis yeah  so thank

dung	  matt there you go  marisha going at this  matt laughs  marisha bear style  matt they go  this one turns towards and moves this way to focus  on the cave bear that just thrashed against its hide  while this one turns and moves in towards grog  but now turns and sees the actually no  it stays there fixed to grog  so making its multistrike against you keyleth  that is a 26 to hit  marisha hits  matt thats mandibles  17 to hit with its claw  marisha
