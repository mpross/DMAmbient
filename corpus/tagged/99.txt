episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back so last we left off vox machina had been traveling for a means of stopping  the ascension of the whispered one vecna the lich seeking ascension to godhood unfortunately  failed to do so as he transported his shadowfell city of /none/ thar amphala into the prime material  world using the ritual of seeding that was once responsible for bringing the raven queen into the  pantheon brought him as well as the sole god on this side of the divine gate and possible  godruler of the prime material plane using the power of his worshippers and of his newfound  abilities in his avatar god form he gave temporary undead life to a longburied dead  primordial earth titan that lay deep beneath the ground in issylra it has begun hulking its way  closer and closer toward the /none/ dawn cradle the city of vasselheim as you traversing through the  innards of this titan making your way within the city of thar amphala sneakily finding your way  beneath the dome which he had constructed to keep outside any of the assailing forces you managed  to defeat and destroy delilah made an ally of arkhan the oathbreaker paladin dragonborn sent  sylas off to recover and hopefully have enough time you ascended the tower of entropis where  you fell into one of a number of traps that vecna had laid out for you causing you to /none/ kill two  almost three of your closest friends and family managing to recover them within an inch of  irrecoverability you sent them with gilmore off to safety as the black knight made its way up the  staircase arkhan heading it off at the pass giving you the opportunity to rise up to the top  of the tower to face vecna the ascended you quickly take these last 20 or so seconds as you  rush up the steps one after the other your heartbeat pulsing through your body your breath  coming in and out with /none/ staggered beats vox machina what do you want to do with these last 20  seconds  laura im going to take out a vial of holy oil and im going to dip my needle arrows that tary  gave me into the holy oil im going to pour the remainder on trinkets claws  sam how far are we from the entry to this chamber or whatever  matt youre not entirely certain as you guys are ascending you begin to see a peek of greenish  light thats peeking up ahead starting to brighten the spiral staircase as /none/ you ascend you  get the sense youre getting close  sam when we get 20 feet away from it 15 feet away from it im going to cast unseen servant and  hand him my whip tell scanlan two buddy i need you but not right away when this whip falls  come in the room  laura oh no  matt the secondary scanlan takes a moment looks at you nods okay  sam i believe in you buddy ive always believed in number two  matt truer words were never spoken and if you fall ill tell /none/ the tale of the scanlan that left  me with his number two whip  sam i love you buddy  matt i love you too youre not sure if you should go in for a kiss or not  sam we shake hands  travis im waiting im waiting to see our foe before i smash  matt for the record as the ascent and the time its cast youll probably arrive at the top of  the tower with about for the purposes of gameplay and time wishywashiness ill give you  about 30 seconds once the encounter /none/ starts in which the haste will remain 25 to 30  liam while that conversation was happening i tug keyleth back and the wings flex out and around in  a bit of a shell around us quickly forever and ever and always i steal what i assume is my last  kiss lets go  ashley oh no im already crying we havent started  sam why cant we hear you  ashley wait can you hear me  laura there now we can  ashley before we go out there lets hold hands real quick just know i /none/ love you guys so much and  youre my family were going to make it through this okay im going to cast holy aura on  everybody  sam whats that what does that do  ashley okay basically if you stay within 30 feet of me i cant even read this because my  eyes are watering you have advantage on all saving throws and other creatures have  disadvantage on attack rolls  liam all saves  sam wait matts correcting you  matt interesting point of order they dont have to be within 30 feet of you /none/ for it to affect you  it looks like as long as theyre within 30 feet of you when you cast it then you guys can run  anywhere  travis are you serious thats even better  laura okay so advantage on saving throws anybody attacking us gets disadvantage  marisha is that on melee attacks or all attacks  matt attack rolls  ashley when a fiend or undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack the aura flashes a  brilliant light the attacker must succeed on a constitution saving throw or be blinded until the /none/  spell ends  travis thats fucking great  taliesin thatll do  sam why havent we always used this  travis dont worry about it shes been at her books  liam shes all growed up  matt heading up the stairs the greenish light of the surface greets you as you break toward the top  of the tower this ascent is somewhat familiar to keyleth having seen this exact arrival once  before as you were originally scrying on the death knight as soon as you hit the peak the  wind sends your hair behind you /none/ and scattering across your face as you can see the extremely  strong cyclone that encapsulates the top of this tower is now swirling around you there are  occasional breaks in the clouds where you see glimpses of the sprawling city of vasselheim right  below you you see the titans feet have already breached the outer walls and have begun crushing  their way through the braving grounds of the city columns of smoke swirl upward to engulf the  behemoths legs with each impact you get the sense the entire city is leaned forward as its  /none/ begun to assault thousands upon thousands of soldiers that have swarmed up toward the base of  the creature you can see arrow and spell being flung from a distance you can see other flying  soldiers wyvernriders eagleriders across the way that are crashing into gloomstalker clouds  that are swooping down to engulf the skies above the city as the four giant arms of this titan  continue to pummel and smash tossing large towers and temples breaking into bits of rubble and  rock you can see hundreds of warriors man siege weapons against this unstoppable ancient /none/ threat  as giant rocks and boulders go flying past slamming the sides of the giant dome that still  remain holding however there you can see the large wedge that you had already left free and  open where the soldiers that managed to break through the initial onslaught of the gloomstalkers  are beginning to swarm in and try and make their way in your direction  bolts of green energy crackle and fork through the swirling clouds around you your eyes creep upward  to lock onto the terrifying avatar form of vecna the ascended the undying /none/ kingmadegod is now a  huge skeletal lich body floating about 40 feet above the tower staring down at you tendrils of  screaming souls entwined within his limbs and the tome he has clutched in his right hand stretching  with every gesture you see the faces screech and cry in pain as theyre withered and torn as his  arms shift downward to greet you the gaping left socket is almost blinding with crackling power  arcs of arcane tethers crawling across his chest and face his left hand however is whole  seemingly recovered a part of /dung/ his previous power the hand of vecna appears to have been reattached  the artifact now pulses with the same green energy that sparks from his voided socket across his  long tattered red robes and his dark golden armor his ribcage glows from within sending beams of  sickly green light out at each gap and there floating in the bones the faint outline of a  small humanoid form locked within make a perception check everyone  laura what  marisha who is it though  travis nine  taliesin natural 20  laura 31  liam 24 /none/  sam eight  marisha 21  ashley 25  matt ooh nice so you five look up to see an unconscious little girl of human and elven  descent velora floats encased within the ribcage of the avatar form she appears to be in some sort  of a trance and is held by nothing but air and energy a terrible familiar smile creeps across  the face his thin mummified lips curling into an impossibly long exaggerated smile that defies the  constraints of the skull that held it i was curious who would seek my blessing first /none/ you all  have proven driven enough to deserve the personal touch of my wrath when i discovered your wily  tricks merely shifting about beneath my nose the humor of it was not lost on me this omniscience  is still new i learned to push my limits with each passing moment i thank you for showing me i  reward you by sharing with you the ruin of this once beautiful city a familiar oblivion to you  each now perfected i would like you all to please place yourselves  sam its so simple and beautiful  /none/ matt youve arrived  travis i feel like its not what we think it is  matt place yourselves around this entrance in what order you wouldve ascended to this point  laura wheres vecna  sam what is that thing in the middle  matt ill show you once you place yourselves based on how you ascended  travis were right near the entrance right no further  laura everybody just came out and were standing in a big clump right here  matt unless you wanted to scatter lets say about anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from /none/ where the  entrance is as you rush out to look over the side of the wall all right we have percival over here  laura im on the other side of percival  marisha can you move keyleth to where percival was  matt so ill say over here  sam ill be next to grog  liam wheres vex now shes over there im going to go to the side of this glowy thing can i get there  matt you can get about this far for just the ascension  ashley im going to be close to /none/ grog too  travis the action that i held coming  up the stairs can i cast enlarge  matt ill say you can do that as hes speaking  liam can i get any farther with my wings out i popped them out before we came up  matt then whooshing theres grog well say you can get for the sake of placement about 20 feet up  liam no i wanted to hover like five feet above  matt to this side because you have your wings out sure ill let you get there  laura trinket is /none/ going to stay right at the entrance  matt right there  laura yeah  good boy  sam guard that entrance  laura hes just waiting to see whats going on  sam this is fine  laura oh my god  travis what the fuck is that  marisha thats amazing  sam what  marisha can you see this ash  ashley i just see a lot of swirls  marisha ash im going to take a picture and send it to you  laura make sure you get his good side  sam oh man he /none/ looks so cool  laura did you do this matthew you made this didnt you you painted it  matt well i had friends help me because ive been planning a wedding  liam before he started that was optimus prime  laughter  matt that was actually converted from my critter gift a while back  laura really  matt yeah so even the community helped so to give you some perspective in size to his newly  ascended avatar form all of his power focused into a single physical entity that is the vecna  produced since the /none/ ritual of seeding  travis shit  matt i would like you all to roll initiative  screaming  ashley holy crap  travis lets do this here we go  sam can i inspire myself for this roll  matt its an ability check i think right  sam yeah but i dont have a turn  laura i already forgot its like i just walked into target ive lost all brain function  marisha dont fuck me gil hey not bad  liam thanks gil  matt there we go now we got the music going all right /none/ so 30 to 25  travis 27  laura 25  matt 25 to 20  liam 22  travis why are you all so fucking quiet over there  matt 20 to 15  taliesin 15  marisha 17  matt and percival 15 to ten  travis fucking gnomes what happened  matt ten to five  sam eight  laura ashley what did you roll  ashley two  laughter  liam its like a chime  ashley off to a good start  sam unless i can inspire myself  matt if you want to  /none/ sam i mean im not going to get anywhere higher in the order  laura you might go before whatever some of the shit that he doles out hes just going to  consistently dole shit out  marisha oh my god this is awful  matt vecna goes first  laura of course he does hes a god  marisha youve got to be fucking kidding me  matt as he stands above he lifts his hand you watch as the atmosphere above at the outskirts of  this cyclone above the city a tear in space and time /none/ begins to rip a familiar sound youve heard  once before you watch as giant flaming rocks three of them go firing down into vasselheim you  watch as the apex of the temple of kord gets impacted and crumbles down to one side in a  flaming ruin you watch as a secondary one slams down into the center of the city in a familiar  district to you pike and a third one goes arcing off towards the temple of the raven queen and  with a distant explosion the flash encompasses that vicinity this is what you /none/ would notice if  the fourth one didnt come flying straight for the top of the tower  travis goddamn it its personal now  matt as it slams into the center of the tower apex i need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw  laura everybody gets advantage yes and he gets disadvantage on things against us  liam we get advantage on saves from pikes spell  matt thats correct  laura any spell from an evil creature that attacks me takes 4d6 radiant damage and is knocked prone  matt thats correct so go ahead and /none/ roll the damage  liam is grog within ten feet of me  matt grog is yes  liam then you get plus two from me  marisha oh yeah did everyone pop their blessings  laura yeah we all popped our blessings yes pelor 12 radiant damage woo  sam hey i think hes looking pretty rough  laura hes bloodied hes definitely bloodied  matt so what did you get  travis 17  laura oh for saving throws sorry i rolled my  sam with advantage  laura and what is this saving throw for dexterity  /none/ matt yes  marisha i get to add plus four right because were blessed  liam d4 thats right  laura 29 plus three thats 32  travis 17  matt fail  laura 32  matt success  liam 30  matt success  marisha 21  matt fail  taliesin 15  matt fail  sam natural 20 26  matt just succeeds  laura wait if we roll a natural 20 that doesnt mean its an automatic success we still have to  add numbers to it  sam ones are an automatic fail twenties are not /none/ successes right  matt with a skill set with a saving throw i generally consider a natural 20 an autosuccess  but letting you know thats still barely a pass  travis 25 is his  sam dc  matt 26  travis 26 is  matt he just made it pike what did you roll  ashley 20 not a natural 20 but 19 plus one  matt so everyone who failed you take 67 points of bludgeoning damage halved if you succeeded  marisha 67  laura so 34  matt and 66 points of fire damage  /none/ travis what is it  matt 67 and 66 yeah  travis and i take half of that as well  liam and evasion evades all of that  matt correct  laura can i do an uncanny dodge for any of that thats just for melee attacks  matt uncanny dodge is for a melee attack  travis ill get the calculator out because my brain is not working  ashley wait what kind of damage was this  matt bludgeoning and fire  ashley i have resistance to bludgeoning  laura you have resistance to fire too  /none/ matt well say 66 points of damage is what you take  ashley okay  matt also pike and anybody with a concentration spell i need you to make a concentration check  liam do i with the evasion  matt you do not because you did not take any damage  sam its a plus what now charisma  matt its a constitution saving throw  laura so you get advantage on that saving throw  travis i remember three meteors last time not four  sam i mean theres no way we can beat the amount of damage /none/ he did  ashley 22  matt with half the damage no so holy aura fades  travis holy aura fades  marisha are you serious  sam 27  matt 27 you maintain concentration wait no because half the damage would be 33 you do not  theres too much damage no youre right  sam the whip falls to the floor  matt wait you took 30 im sorry you took half damage from everything no its still 66 so you  guys do drop your spells unfortunately  travis oh my god literally oh my shitty undead /none/ god  taliesin this a lot im having a hard time figuring out this damage  matt thats okay figure out the math here because it sunders the tower  travis it what  sam what does that mean  travis it fucking ignites and explodes the tower sunders is not a good word  laura so if we cant fly  sam it sunders the tower  liam break to split asunder  matt if i could get somebody to take this off here for me  sam but that map was so pretty  laura youre splitting the /none/ party  travis oh shit  sam how did you make that how did you build that thing  laura this is crazy  taliesin this is not cool dude  liam worst carvel cake ever  marisha yeah he ordered these they are cake stands and i was like oh are these for our  wedding cake and he was like  sam no  travis you cracked the tower what is the matter with you  marisha cake of fucking death  travis im at a loss for what were looking at right now  laura matt this /none/ is so cool but terrible  taliesin im at precisely 70 points  marisha i cant believe this  matt all right so using the photo replication of this  marisha is it floating like a gravitational state  matt i also need everyone to make a strength saving throw please  sam saving throw at advantage  laura not anymore  sam what why  laura because she lost holy aura because he fucking did all the damage  matt sorry its in the wrong direction  travis thats all right take your time  liam if im airborne /none/ do i make the same strength saving throw  matt no anyone whos flying doesnt have to worry about it necessarily  taliesin where were you earlier fucker  travis let us know if we can help  ashley oh wait did you say anyone whos flying doesnt have to  matt doesnt have to make the strength saving throw  travis you should be okay because of your dopeass sarenrae wings or whatever  matt so as that detonates and sends it this way that puts us  sam so holy auras gone  laura yep that fast  /none/ sam that was fun  ashley thats cool  sam it saved us a bunch of points of damage though  laura was he knocked prone  matt no hes immune to prone  laura of course he is  travis hes immune to prone  sam how does he make love  laughter  travis you went there that fast  liam hes so happy though now that his hand is back let me tell you  laura its only up against a wall for vecna  matt you guys all got slammed and scattered across this tower from /none/ the explosion where he is  now currently uses his movement to shift over here and move up  travis best laid plans huh  taliesin no plan survives contact with the enemy thats the truth  sam wait can your thing still  marisha it should still be able to work yeah theoretically  laura theoretically  liam you sick bastard matt i love you so much slash hate you  matt so after the explosion hits the ringing in your ear begins to subside your vision returns  and you look about the nowbroken tower youve grabbed on /none/ to what you can so strength saving  throws for those who werent flying  travis 24  sam 12  laura 20  taliesin 27  marisha 19  taliesin 22 i mean 22 im so sorry  matt so everybody but scanlan makes the save so scanlan with the detonation you get thrown off  the side of the tower and begin to plummet off the side  sam great awesome  matt so ill put you right there for the time being from the impact of it moving back thats  going to end vecnas turn grog /none/ youre up first  travis im up first  sam should i roll initiative for the guy in the hallway  matt sure  sam okay 16  marisha yeah the whip is down  taliesin you shouldve sent the guy in the hallway in first maybe  marisha i love that from his perspective you were like if the whip hits the floor come after us  footsteps yelling crashing  matt also did you roll 4d6 damage  laura yes i did  matt how much was it  laura 12  matt 12 points of radiant damage /none/ to him the flash hits he floats up and now you can see he  chuckles looking down at the destruction the green tendrils of energy the veinlike  projections that have been clutching the tower together are now extending out like tethers  grasping the bottom of each floating island that used to be the top of entropis as they slowly  shift held in place and rotate around the storm still cycling around you  laura thats so crazy theyre like floating things  matt yeah theyre floating now held in place by these green tethers and theyre /none/ slowly shifting  grog youre up  travis hasted can i attempt to leap from this island to the one that vax is currently on  matt yeah make an athletics check  travis okay  marisha so it looks like those electrotouchy balls what are those called  travis 28  matt 28 yeah easy you leap over it would be 20 feet of movement  travis can i move to this corner  matt okay  travis can i attach the chain of returning to the sword of kas and throw it up to vecna reckless  matt /none/ sure go for it  laura reckless  travis like it matters  sam everything is reckless at this point  travis yeah thats true  laura we all rage  travis 31 to hit  matt 31 hits so as youre getting the chain as you leap over and go running across the platforms  you can see the entire platform is lilted to one side and some stones are tumbling and skidding off  the side you can see bits of the stone are charred from the immediate destruction and impact  of the meteors and as you /none/ pull the chain out as you rush and attach it the voice pulses through  your head yes hes here right there kill him take him down deliver me  travis cant wait okay calm down 22 this is undead  matt yes  travis just checking ten 32 33 plus enlarge plus four so 37 necrotic damage  matt necrotic  travis well no im sorry not necrotic just 37 regular slashing damage  matt all right so 37 points of slashing damage all right with that you toss the blade up into the  side oh and you /none/ see for a second theres a brief flash of recognition and a slight sliver of  worry on his brow for but an instant before his hand reaches up and grabs towards to try and pull  the blade out  travis i pull the chain back catch it with my hasted action throw it again reckless  matt okay so you pull it back and make your attack  travis thats 27  matt 27 that hits  travis 20 thats a nine so 34 plus one 35 points of slashing damage  matt 35 points of slashing damage /none/ as you draw the blade back for the second swing and you rotate  it as it goes i can taste him and you fling it upward and it pierces once more into the abdomen  each time you begin to grow more and more nervous with the proximity of the blade towards the  currently unconscious and contained little girl inside the chest  travis i do  matt others may you may be fine but its passing within like a foot of her each time  travis where is she in relation to him  matt inside the /dung/ chest cavity  travis right got to keep that in mind  matt second time as it hits theres another flash of dark energy are you withdrawing it  travis yes  matt okay make another check to pull it out  sam is she like in his chest cavity  matt yeah contained in it  travis thats a natural 19 thatll do it  matt yeah you pull it back is that your turn  travis im frenzied so i have another attack  matt you do  travis okay reckless last one  matt hold on no /none/ im sorry because you used  travis attack was to throw one but i only get the one because i cant do attackattack  matt correct  travis and then the hasted is another action and then the bonus is to make another attack but only  a single  matt sure  travis does that work  matt yeah  travis so its a 30 flat no  matt im thinking for this because its not like the hammer you throw up returns every single  time its like  you impact and then you have to pull it /none/ back each time  travis it takes more than an attack action  matt yeah so id say you attack then you used your hasted action to pull it back and lets say  you bonus action threw it in so its actually still in him so its currently embedded in him  with the chain now taut at the maximum length hes now 30 feet above you 35 technically but  youre in large mode  travis i have some speed left can i run and jump across i want to land over here  matt make an athletics /none/ check  sam i know you do but do we as players care about this girl  travis 19  matt 19 yeah thatll work  laura yeah you do you  travis i dont know up here man shits floating in the fucking air  matt as you run and leap and bound you manage to catch the edge let me check real fast  liam i mean i did just kill your daughter  laura its true so it is up to you  liam she was brought back but i did kill her  sam yeah  /none/ marisha casualties of war  matt actually a number of feet up to your strength score if you move at least ten feet on  foot so  travis feet up to my strength score  matt yeah so you dont have to roll for that you can move 26 feet with a jump as long as you get  ten feet of runup because of your speed so yeah you leap across without issue the chain is taut as  you tarzanswing across the way and land on the other side still holding on to it  travis how /none/ did that feel  matt delicious hes talking to you from a distance at the end your turn vecnas going to  use two legendary actions  laura and travis two legendary actions  matt yes to cast a spell as a reaction as you glance past oh no we cannot let that stay near  and as he pulls out and opens his hands i need you to go ahead grog and make a actually you  dont make a saving throw grog vanishes from the battlefield gone you watch as this space closes  around it grog you /none/ suddenly appear in a darkened tunnel of some kind you look around and you can  see hard walls to each point and ahead of you it splits in two different directions behind you  it splits into three different directions  travis im back in the chest of the titan does it look familiar do i remember  matt it looks completely unfamiliar  travis it splits in two behind me  matt two ahead of you and then three behind you  marisha are you in the maze of the abyss  travis do i recognize it  /none/ matt no youve never seen this place before in your life  marisha youre in the endless maze of the abyss you got to be  laura i dont know what that is  travis its not my turn anymore  matt nope thats the end of grogs turn vex youre up  marisha its another plane  travis i completely forgot that happened last time of all the tactical things i watched  laura it wasnt him that did it it was the other guy it was the death knight that did it to you  last time  /none/ travis thats right it was the death knight how did we fix that last time  laura im going to look over at percy and grab his hand for a second  matt do enough damage to make him drop concentration thats what you did last time to  bring him back  taliesin i regret nothing  laura nothing at all hunters mark  matt hunters mark vecna all right bonus action  laura yeah get ready vecna  liam 1d6 bitch  matt oh god  liam hes dead  matt thats not helping  taliesin hes wearing /none/ it like a bangle from the 80s  travis i like how hes surrounded by swirls of aquafresh  laura and im going to run over to where grog had beenish  travis and mourn  laura cry over you not quite that far im staying against the wall yeah thats better not  that it matters very much then im going to shoot him with my holy damageneedle arrow  matt go for it roll for the attack  laura okay that is a 30  matt 30 that hits  laura great can i make it a bramble /none/ shot  matt sure  sam im falling right  matt you are you got lobbed off the side from the explosion and the tower crumbling beneath you you  couldnt find purchase you grabbed part of the stone and your fingers slid and scraped off  marisha you got something for that right  sam yeah but gets me out of commission for a round  taliesin weve got to figure out how to get grog back  laura 41 damage and he has to make a strength saving throw  travis that breaks concentration right  laura well /none/ yeah but  matt that is  travis what dont look at that what was it  matt okay hes going to burn a legendary resistance he does not want to be restrained  right now  travis he has used two legendary actions and a resistance right  marisha yeah but i think he gets two or three  legendary actions per turn  matt so he burns off that so that was a total of 41 damage so half that  laura oh wait oh never mind yes 41 damage  matt so hes going to make a /none/ concentration check yeah he succeeds thats 22  laura okay im going to hit him again  matt he had to roll a 20  laura im going to hit him again with another needle arrow  travis dont be afraid of rolling ones man  laura what was that before i hit it  travis 11 did it move  laura i dont what it was before i hit it with this dice  liam and travis reroll  laura sorry actually i think that was probably it  travis it was lower since were being honest  laura /none/ 25  liam is this your blessed  matt 25 piercing damage  laura no

holy damage from those arrows  matt no what it does is it bypasses or can hit creatures that normally are immune to nonmagical  weapons like those ghosts and things so it doesnt have an additional effect /none/ that you can see  from it unfortunately  laura oh all right  matt so how much damage was it  laura 19  liam hey now this is our first god were fighting  matt okay yeah he does make his save still so as the two arrows swish past and slam into part of  his neck it seems to pass through a period where its just energy a second one whisks through  the bottom of his body  laura plus another one point of damage  matt all right 20 and he glances down at /none/ you the eye flashes oh dont worry im coming for  you soon enough that end your turn  laura yes i forgot  matt laughter

field you also notice as the detonation of radiant energy blasts his  form ugh he withdraws a bit and you can see the energy flicker and dropping from within his  ribcage you watch as a slightly burned unmoving little girl begins to fall out of him  marisha i really hope i didnt kill another kid  laura hope you didnt kill our sister  travis people never change keyleth  marisha fuck you  laughter  liam shes /none/ off the side yeah  matt shes plummeting through this crack straight down  travis hey man at least you hit him  marisha man i was just starting to get over that first kid not

this  too from cabals ruin so ill see what one of that does  matt youre on deck  taliesin thats awful eight points of silvered piercing damage plus seven points of lightning  damage  matt okay as the skeleton lunges towards you you put the barrel of /none/ the gun oh this is the  sword i see as you do it cuts right through and bones go scattering off the side as its  destroyed  taliesin 15 did it thats fine next shot im taking the shot with the skeleton thats next to vex  matt okay so you sheathes sword gunshot  taliesin yep and i killed a thing so i get a grit back thats 30 to hit  matt that

down  taliesin 14 points of damage plus five points of psychic and one point of lightning  matt as its scraping at your betrothed you fire the gun and watch as the skeleton skull blasts  clean off the rest of the body it scratches one more time before it clatters into a pile of  lifeless bones  taliesin i get another grit back and now where are there other skeletons whos getting it  matt theres three over there one over there /none/ and three over there that are waiting  taliesin im going to take a whack at the one thats right next to keyleth  sam does he take only magical damage  taliesin yeah  matt he takes damage from magical weapons  laura so your weapon is magical isnt it  taliesin yeah but im not going to do technically is my weapon magical  matt animus is  taliesin okay so animus will do  laura so you can do damage against him  taliesin yeah but right now im better at clearing than anything im not going /none/ to be the  one who does damage to him  laura i feel like if you can break his concentration  taliesin yeah lets have a little fun for my third shot im going to turn on him first im  going to cast hex  matt okay as a bonus action hexed  taliesin he is necro disadvantage on intelligence because fuck that guy and im going  to hit him with animus im going to drop a point of grit for advantage  travis just chilling im having trouble staying awake  taliesin damn it well that /none/ will do 31 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin and im throwing all of cabal into it so thats 1d10 sorry im trying to do this  1d10  matt count the lightning damage separately  taliesin yes i know so thats not bad 15 points of damage plus six points of psychic  damage and lets drop six points of lightning damage into it three four five six thats not  bad 21 points of lightning damage  matt all right thats 31 total for that hes going to make a concentration check natural 18  hes /dung/ fine  taliesin actually there was one more im so sorry i forgot to do the necrotic damage on top  of that so with necrotic damage thats another six points of necrotic damage  matt you notice both the blasts of lightning and the dark necrotic energy seem to be partially  wounding but not on the level youd expect  taliesin okay still what i expected im going to burn an action surge  laura yeah hit again  taliesin im not going to hit him again because i got no more if everything goes well i can /none/ do 24  points of damage to him  laura but that might make him break his concentration  sam its now or never  marisha weve got to get grog back grog has a trammel  taliesin im going to use sharpshooter fuck it lets see if that does anything im going to add  sharpshooter im going to burn my last grit for advantage  laura you got this percy  taliesin lets see if that hits this is probably not going to hit is it thats a six thats  okay yeah probably didnt hit yeah this /none/ is really shitty  marisha how can you tell  taliesin i can tell 17 to hit  matt nope just passes through one of the open spaces in the ribs  taliesin so ive got two more shots im taking another shot with no advantage  matt sharpshooter  taliesin yeah 19 to hit  matt 19 this one actually hits the armor and reflects off  taliesin last shot  laura youve got this you got this  taliesin thats better 24 to hit  matt that hits  marisha just on the cusp  taliesin just on /none/ the cusp so thats my 1d10 plus my 1d6 plus my other 1d6 is that right yeah  thats 15 22 points of damage plus five points of psychic damage and two points of necrotic damage  sam how do you want to do this  laughter  matt that is a 22 so this final shot hits him and he barely feels an impact and grins down at  you as a baneful gaze curling across the floor hes now aware of your presence  laura did he take a concentration  matt he did he succeeded  taliesin /none/ im going to break line of sight behind that wall just head up there a little bit about  there yeah actually still against the wall though  matt okay so that moves you up to there thats your turn end of percivals turn scanlan as you  are now off the edge you can see the edge of the tower vanishing away from you the cyclone  whirling above part of it catches you on the way out as you hit the edge of the cyclone thats  circulating it go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw at /none/ disadvantage because youre  falling  sam 19  matt 19 okay so you take half damage  sam damage  travis cyclone  matt wouldve been 16 points of piercing damage from the shrapnel being spun around it you  instead take eight  travis eight  sam okay  travis sorry  laura laughs youre just repeating everything matt says  laughter  sam i dont know i have no good options nothing of course i can save myself but im  trying to do more than just

impacted theres still the stairway its just  cusping up in the bottom of one of these pieces so theres a little bit there  laura all right but i used all my movement i cant get to it and get her there  matt if you want to try and toss her  laura im not going to toss her no shes unconscious  /none/ matt then wait until next turn  laura okay  matt all right that ends your turn  sam wait what did you

going to fly up and get within 50 feet of this dick  matt okay you can do that pretty easily youre pretty much on the same level as /none/ scanlan and  bigby  taliesin hes engaged by the way with bigbys hand  liam thats fine but i have vow of enmity so i have permanent advantage at the moment  matt youre able to get there  liam yeah okay so im going to  sam were literally playing three dimensional chess right  matt yeah  liam im within 60 feet im going to try to throw at the tome in his hand and im going to  dagger dagger dagger dagger  sam oh four daggers  liam so first one  ashley get that /none/ bitch  liam first one is a 32 no its not its a 33  matt the first attack was with disadvantage because youre aiming for something specifically  liam oh okay  laura so that would have been a 13 was the lower number  liam oh okay 28  matt okay  liam so this is sneak attack damage on the book okay so thats two plus eight is ten  sam the book what if its just lady chatterleys lover or something  travis interdimensional chess with the steve jobs of dd  liam that is 36 /none/ for the first attack on the book  matt you watch as the tome that hes holding spatters into pages and hes like huh  sam aw shit  matt you destroyed the tome  laura maybe hes just pretending like hes not upset about it  liam i will now start unloading into his body  laura it was his journal  marisha its okay now becky wont know i was talking shit about her  liam thats a 17 which doesnt hit  matt right  liam does not hit third attack is 20 oh wait what did /none/ i say last 17 18  matt 17  liam 19 doesnt hit next one is 29  matt 29 hits  liam okay and this is just him  laura was that a dog  marisha i think it was the weird echoy sound of ashleys pages turning  liam 17 for that and the last dagger does 25  matt 25 to hit  liam yep  matt that hits  liam and that is a measly little four so that was action action action four and thats it  sam so what was your total damage  /dung/ liam i dont know what the total was  matt succeeds on a save  liam i was after the book  matt he hit him twice  liam and i use my full movement to get where i am right now  matt to get where you are right here is for because youre hasted so  liam 120 feet  matt yeah so no it took you about 60 feet to get there youre right here currently  liam so then i will go to the piece of cake that percys on in the dark portion but again /none/ ten feet  flying above  matt right about there well say so tomes destroyed the daggers seem to slide into him he  maintains concentration  taliesin got to drop concentration someones got to hit him really hard  matt that ends your turn  liam mmhmm  matt okay lets see here  marisha laura and taliesin wait  liam waiting to dive after velora didnt have anything ready  matt okay end of your turn  marisha what do you have what did you forget  sam no no i just didnt hit him its okay  /none/ matt end of your turn hes going to go ahead and use two of his legendary actions all right  seems the battlefield has been expended as he glares down at the gnome and the other gnome  lets try this again make an intelligence saving throw with advantage  sam i have no more reactions right were still in the same round  travis no this is a new round  matt but it hasnt come back to his turn  marisha druid die and dont fuck me gil dont fuck me gil  sam thats cocked  travis /none/ no its on a page and a marker  marisha well this one fell off  sam whats that  laura oh well that that doesnt  sam what was it  marisha i mean it was a floating three  liam it was cocked  sam that was pretty cocked  travis it was on a page and a marker  taliesin i would be happy to let you take that i mean personally i normally would yeah  travis just let it land flat its big  marisha oh no its a 13  liam with the d4 /none/  marisha no  laura oh its a 13  marisha this isnt good 15 plus my intelligence oh wait my intelligence oh and im trained in  okay wait what did i just say 17 plus eight 25  matt nope  laura 25 isnt high enough oh his thing is 26  travis yeah its 26  marisha hang on  matt so as the spell energy whips out from his hand and entwines  taliesin and sam oh youre inspired  laura thats right youre inspired  marisha can i use my inspiration too  matt thats /none/ what its there for  liam all you need is one  marisha yeah okay im good plus a six 31  travis oh my god im going to pull my face off  sam matt does not like that  matt the cocked die argument was not resolved you guys just rolled well move forward with it  but cutthroat from here on out  travis okay  marisha i can take it  liam can i sacrifice one of my lucks as tribute  matt sacrifice all your lucks if you want to  marisha i asked you /none/ tell me what to do if it was cocked or not you just stared and went like this  matt i was thinking its fine you resist the spell no effect no impact  marisha you were thinking what would you have claimed  liam and taliesin moving on  matt were moving on its all good  marisha i dont want to get targeted later matt i want you to treat me fairly okay  travis im pretty sure hes missed you twice youre going to get targeted he made me vanish in  one turn  marisha i /dung/ mean on the internet i mean from people being pissed at me on the internet  matt youre fine that then brings us to the initiative count 20 first off the currently  existing skeletons all swarm in on keyleth as the only one standing thats three attacks on you  that is 12  marisha miss  matt 18  marisha hits  matt and no so you get one hit thats seven points of slashing damage to you also you feel  this pulse wave of dark energy swell out from outside of vecna in the vicinity it /none/ cascades out  encompassing the entirety of the area and then fades and all of you feel a little colder on the  inside for the next round anybody with resistance to necrotic damage its negated  laura am i within that area if i went down to save velora  travis laughter hey oh god  matt yep  liam i am sweating all over  matt at this point in time you hear this roar as the clouds suddenly explode and part from the  nearby cyclone and you watch as two gloomstalkers come swarming outward wounded one /none/ of them slaps  into the side of one of the islands and collapses a second one suddenly gets snatched in the jaws of  what now you see a sparkling brass dragon emerge from the side  liam prayers are answered  matt as jmon sa ord flies in glances right up in the form of devossa towards vecna and shouts  out in a deep bellowing dragon voice your time is done old one fall before us all snarls roars  and unleashes a torrent of flame upward in the direction of both vecna and bigbys hand  /none/ laura thank god youre not there  sam sure  matt so lets see that is going to be dc 21 does not make the save so thats 56 points of  fire damage  sam oh shnikes  travis oh shit and hes got to roll for his concentration  matt yep which he does not make  taliesin oh thank god  travis he doesnt make it  marisha are you coming back come back come back  matt hes going to use his fourth legendary resistance to maintain it  sam four  ashley come on  /none/ matt he does not want you on that field grog  laura with the legendary resistances do you get legendary resistance every round  matt no he has a total of legendary resistances he can use per day legendary actions he gets  every single round  laura okay  liam but he has 17  laura probably  sam is that 56 points of damage thats with no save  matt correct well a dexterity saving throw if he gets one  sam i dont know what my dex is im looking ac dexterity of ten so he rolled /none/ a 15 did not  matt nope nope 56 points of damage  sam so he lost some points but he has my hit points what does he have im looking im  looking sorry i got it you go on with your thing  matt its okay bigbys hand has hit points equal to your hit point maximum so yeah  sam okay so hes still alive  matt yeah okay as soon as jmon roars and shows up vecna turns around oh no we cannot have  this at the end of jmons turn  marisha dont kill /none/ jmon  taliesin theyre such a nice miniature  matt hes going to look about the field and consider what the current importance is and  instead glance downward and use two more legendary actions to cast dispel on your  simulacrum understanding that you do not have any reactions to counter  marisha youre going to use two to try and do it  matt its two to cast a spell and with dispel magic is going to go ahead and cast it at  5thlevel  sam i have no reaction right it hasnt come back to me /none/  matt nope so at 6thlevel its an 8thlevel spell correct simulacrum  sam yes  laura no its a 7thlevel spell  matt oh but you cast it as an  sam as wish  matt right but it just creates the spell so itd be 9th so with his 5thlevel hed still  have to make an ability check  travis he has to roll  matt using the spellcasting ability which is  taliesin which is what  liam intelligence and hes hexed  taliesin he has disadvantage on it intelligence checks  matt its ability modifier /none/ yeah so he has disadvantage  marisha percy in the house  matt thats a natural 20 but with disadvantage second one was a 13 plus ten thats a 23 thats  enough so with that second scanlan is dispelled off the field  laura do all of the things that we gave him fall down to the ground  sam including me  matt well no this bigbys hand yes actually  taliesin does that bigbys hand vanish with the caster  matt yes its a concentration spell  taliesin well you got a little bit of a fall /none/  matt so you start falling once more as bigbys hand vanishes you watch as scanlan two melts into  snow and water onto the ground dripping off the clothing and items that he had clattering and  rolling off into oblivion and you begin plummeting  sam he died as he lived making the world a little bit wetter  taliesin its about 30 feet from where you are right now  liam and it looks like hes above stone  matt so you would fall to about there youd fall prone one thing ill put you there laying /none/ you  prone because otherwise youll slide and you suffer  sam can the audience even see me right now  matt you take 14 points of bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone  sam okay  taliesin thats not bad thats doable  sam 14 points of damage does not make me lose concentration right  matt nope  sam okay  matt all right scanlan two is gone keyleth its your turn  marisha oh my god already oh my god youre still fucking gone  laura you should do it but you should do it when he /none/ comes back thats the thing  travis hes so high up it doesnt matter right now  taliesin yeah right now it doesnt matter at all  laura how high do they go  marisha 40 feet  laura psh  travis yeah  marisha then i am going to burn my 9thlevel shapechange  matt okay what are you changing into  marisha im going to turn into a planetar  laura yes  marisha pulling this ripcord  matt hes going to use his well no whats the range on counterspell  travis he has one more legendary /none/ action one more legendary resistance  sam what was the first hit that we took  travis the fireball the meteor  sam how many points  travis 66 if you saved  matt youre too far for him to counterspell so you transform without an issue  laura yes  marisha and thats my action right  matt that is your action yes  marisha i can move as the planetar  matt yep what do you do where are you going keyleth  marisha okay im going to fly my 120 feet move speed and come behind over /none/ hereish but in the air  matt in the air  laura really using all those platforms of yours matt  matt i know  marisha all right a little bit over thats workable  taliesin this is amazing  matt there you go okay is that your turn keyleth  marisha yeah  laura do you have a bonus  marisha i mean i dont think i can do a bonus as a planetar right  matt i mean i dont think he has anything to do as a bonus  marisha no  matt all right that ends /none/ your turn percy youre up  taliesin theres very little of value that i can do right now so im going to hmm  travis speak for yourself  laura fucking shoot him  taliesin not with my  liam go fishing for grog  taliesin fuck  marisha weve got to get grog back  taliesin yeah i guess hes within range so im going to burn my bonus im going to use my bonus  to reload im going to take my first three shots and im going to take out those three skeletons  across the way /none/  laura but theres not even anybody over there  taliesin i know but its going to refill my grit so that i have a better chance of hitting him  travis grit farm do it  taliesin so first shot actually here ill take all three actually no just in case something  terrible happens  matt yeah  taliesin thats 20 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin second one is 25 to hit  matt hits  taliesin and the third one is a crit so i get one back already  marisha crit on a /none/ 19  matt youre up after this scanlan  taliesin and then lets do 1d10 plus 1d6 first one takes 17 points of damage plus four psychic  matt 17 points of damage plus four psychic scattered and destroyed  taliesin second one takes 12 points of damage plus two psychic  matt okay he also is destroyed  taliesin and the other one takes eight the other one is fucking toast im getting into twenties  here not worth it so thats one grit two grit three grit so i have four grit back im burning  my very /none/ last action surge now that i have some bloody grit im trying to remember can i pull  sharpshooter with a grit point or can i not take sharpshooter with  matt you can you cant combine different abilities that spend grit points but you can  combine sharpshooter which is a feat with any attacks you make  taliesin im going to take a sharpshooter plus violent because what else are we going to do so  sharpshooter plus violent shot  matt so youre just using one point for violent  taliesin one point for violent because it /none/ makes it a gamble i dont have advantage i dont know  why im rolling like i do here we go so with sharpshooter yes its a crit  marisha oh my god you and the 19s  taliesin i rolled a 19  marisha crit on a 19  taliesin so crit on a 19  matt which violent shot which is double dice from your weapon  taliesin which is double dice not double psychic just double damage right yeah  matt correct  taliesin its just double  sam the golden snitch  taliesin so that is /none/ that oh man this is great so theres that and then i have the psychic  thats right here so damage is oh my god 11 and then i double that  matt correct you double so its 11 thats 22  taliesin no i rolled them twice so 11 counting 48  matt okay so how much dice does it do per shot its a d10 right  taliesin 1d10 so with violent shot  matt its 2d10  taliesin its 2d10 and then i double the d10 plus 18  matt right yeah great so whats the total /none/  taliesin now im adding the psychic damage  matt right and how much damage is that total  taliesin 48 plus nine points of psychic damage  matt okay 57 points all righty  marisha come on bring him back  matt no thats a failure on his concentration hes not going to use his legendary resistance he  feels pretty comfortable high up so with that grogs giant form reappears right where he left  right there the maze disappears around you and you land back on the space looking around your  friends are in different places /none/ theres a giant brass dragon above you you see an angel flying  above and you can see on the ground hurting scanlan  travis ale solves everything  sam you just took a drink and youre back  matt anywhere you want to move anything else you want to do  taliesin ive got two more shots and remember that you take half that damage at the end of your  next turn  matt correct so thatll be 23 points next turn got it  taliesin mmhmm so for my next shot im going to burn a point /none/ i wonder if a legwing shot would  do anything here all right im going to burn a grit and im not going to do sharpshooter im  just going to take a shot and thats 24 to hit  matt 24 hits  taliesin and thats 13 points of damage plus four points of psychic and strength save versus 20  matt that is a 17 so  taliesin he drops a little bit of  matt how much does he drop does it say  taliesin well i dont remember we used to say prone so i dont /none/ know what you would call that  matt oh does it say prone  taliesin yeah  matt hes immune to prone  taliesin oh no but i thought it was like prone if youre standing but 15 feet if youre in the air  matt no as it says on a hit the target takes normal damage and must make a strength saving  throw or be knocked prone which would affect things normally if they were flying but hes  immune to prone  taliesin all right thats fair that was fine just for fun then lets take /none/ one more shot and  see what happens thats a natural 20  sam it really is  taliesin it really is im going to die im going to fucking die hes going to kill me now  liam but gloriously  taliesin aw man i have made a terrible mistake thats 20 points of damage plus oh really 12  points of psychic damage so 20 points plus 12 which is 32 and his next round he takes half  that as well  matt so next round he takes a total of 39 points of damage automatically from /none/ the hemorrhaging  shot so as each shot impacts the crit hits and you watch him go snarling and as that  impact hits you watch as part of the armor cracks and theres a brief little wound in the  shoulder where you see a glow of energy behind you see the brief a tiny little chink in the  armor of his avatar form  taliesin oh god im not comfortable with that and im taking another ten feet back im starting  to back up a little bit because that was more than i was intending  /none/ matt okay that ends your turn  taliesin breathless yes that ends my turn  matt scanlan youre up  laura okay scanlan youve got this  sam bigbys hand is still near him  matt yep  sam bigbys hand will attack and strike  matt all right thats a bonus action go for it  sam two  laura what the fuck get rid of that dice sam  taliesin thats the only die you ever roll man  sam thats my bonus action can i use my action to strike again  matt if you wanted to /none/ generally i think its supposed to be like you can as a bonus action  cause it to do again so your action has to be something else  sam i have to do something else thats fine hey question before we go on earlier you said  something when ashley did something and you said and when anyone heals in the future its a  plus ten or something what was that  matt thats her blessing from the everlight so only she gets that  sam so when she heals anyone  matt its plus ten to whatever /none/ she heals thats part of the gift she got from her god  travis how high up is vecna above the deck would you say  matt above the deck lets see  taliesin got to get you up there man  matt 75 feet up  taliesin never mind its not my turn anymore i cant say anything  sam 75 so i cant even hit him with anything really  taliesin heal people or do a  ashley healing potion  laura hes got a 9thlevel spell could do something  sam shes a planetar  laura yeah /none/  sam i turn into a giant eagle and ill fly grog up  taliesin yeah  matt he casts polymorph  sam polymorph on myself  matt oh shit  taliesin thats clutch  matt all right  sam i stand up using half my movement  matt yeah so youll have half of your eagles fly form  sam yeah i dont know how far they can fly  marisha i think 60 feet  sam im sure it takes time to get under him and stuff  matt hes pretty heavy in his large size so i /none/ would say  sam oh hes enlarged hes engorged  matt youre at half speed while hes on your back even your fly speed  sam so it was  matt whats the fly speed of the eagle  liam giant eagle is 80 feet  sam so its 40  matt and you used half your movement so you can get 20 feet up yeah  taliesin its cool next round you can do it  sam next round i can get close  taliesin next round he can leap off you  matt well put you there and /none/ well say youre at 20 feet ill acknowledge that here  laura oh no  liam screeches  matt i need to put tape on the eagle i can fix that  laura do you want to hand me that oh you already got tape youre prepared  matt i came prepared all righty  marisha were like an 80s blevel fantasy movie right now  laura this is amazing matt  liam its beautiful  travis ive seen buffets that are uglier than this  matt well thank you wait until the battles over before you thank me  /none/ taliesin wait what  sam no no thats fine i mean bigbys hand couldnt have moved down and gotten grog and gone  back up right  matt i mean it would have taken a couple rounds but youve already made your choices  sam sure so bigbys hands gone  matt because its a concentration spell yeah  sam ooh he wants to hold on  matt i know  sam singing hold on to your love  matt all righty so ending scanlans turn pike youre up  ashley okay so im going to tried and true

two 72 points of radiant damage  marisha whoa we need to start getting some trammels in him i think yall  matt and the /none/ next attack on him has advantage you watch as pike her wings expanded flies up in  the direction as she does she glances upward clutching the holy symbol of sarenrae in her hand  her eyes which have already been glowing since she brought the blessing upon her physical form  now begin to burst with vibrant energy as she extends her hand in front you watch as a singular  comet of divine wrath rockets upward slamming into the front of vecnas chest as the impact  hits he screams out and as he looks down you can /none/ see the anger of his eye flaring the energy now  sparking outward with sheer hatred and you can see the area of the chest where percy had hit and  slightly exposed a wound theres now a gaping wound in the chest where the guiding bolt has hit  and now the energy is crackling across his body guiding the next attack against him  ashley wait i miscalculated its 37 is that what i said  travis you said 36  matt so thats 74 points of damage all righty cool all right pike thats your action and /none/ your  move anything else you want to do  sam heal some shit  ashley yeah am i able to move back down closer to scanlan  matt you can get maybe down ten feet  sam remember scanlan is heading up towards you now as an eagle  matt as an eagle technically hes at full health as an eagle  ashley oh okay  sam but we are within range of you  matt yes grog and scanlan are within range of you  taliesin i am not  sam you can heal yourself if youre

plus your wisdom modifier to grog end of your turn vecnas going to use a  /none/ fifth and final legendary action to cast firebolt again thats going to be oh man its going to  go for the eagle seeing the massive man holding the sword bent on his destruction in his hand  wants to stop that ascension  ashley 15 grog  travis 15 thank you  matt he pulled it back or he would have gone with him when he transported to the maze that is  a 30  sam against what  matt it hits  ashley plus ten  taliesin to grog  ashley to grog yeah  travis 15 /none/ plus ten  matt 25 points of fire damage  sam 26 hit points  matt so you have one hit point left  sam laughs right  taliesin is that right  sam its what it says  laura thats fine youre still 20 feet in the air  matt that ends pikes turn top of the round vecna gets all his legendary actions back vecna  who sees you all swarming upward says ive enjoyed toying with you playing and all this  fantastical experience of seeing what youre capable of but youve severely angered me he  /none/ clutches up with his hand across where the wound is lets end this now with his other hand  raising up you can see the stitch marks on the flesh of the reformed hand of vecna begin to  bulge and as he does the sky above you cracks open a second time as large arcane meteors come  slamming down from above  travis oh boy  matt singing more than one 9thlevel spell he is a fucking god  travis laughs oh jeez oh no  matt to the ground so thats a 40foot radius so it would /none/ hit scanlan and grog pike as it  impacts here pike youre just out of range of the explosions your planetar form however is  caught in the blast radius  marisha it is  matt so everybody but pike and vex are affected by this  sam how many meteors  matt this is another 20d6 fire damage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage  marisha i get advantage on spell saves right  matt i need dexterity saving throws from everybody who was affected  marisha spell save right  taliesin okay so i have advantage from cabals ruin  /none/ liam hashtag blessed  matt are you using your reaction on this one  taliesin not yet i can wait actually yeah im going to use my reaction my once per short  rest my spell swallow  matt scanlan  sam eagle rolled a ten  matt thats a failure grog  travis 18  matt failure  liam 31  matt 31 success  marisha 21  matt both failures so that is 61 points of bludgeoning damage  sam were going to need you pike  matt and 71 points of fire damage  marisha 61 and /none/ 71  matt correct so 132 points of damage unless you have resistance against one or the other  sam what are the two types of damage  laura bludgeoning and fire  marisha oh i have resistance against bludgeoning as a planetar  matt yeah so it would be 30 and 71 so you take 101 points of damage in your planetar form  taliesin i take half damage because im swallowing the spell  matt so you take 65 66  taliesin 66 points of damage  travis i have resistance to both so its 68  matt /none/ 66 well say you take the bulk of that the eagle takes the one and you transform and  you both plummet back down from where you were hitting the ground  sam im dead  matt scanlan is unconscious  laura you took less than a hundred how many hit points did you have  sam i had a hundred points as me and one point as an eagle  matt scanlan is unconscious on the ground  laura oh you dont restore all your hit points with polymorph  marisha no it carries over  matt but you /none/ do have death ward  cheering  matt the moment you hit zero hit points you come back to consciousness youre still prone but  youre at one hit point  sam oh god  matt all righty so grog took that keyleth youve marked that down as well the damage from  that one all right percival since its a 9thlevel spell you gain nine charges  taliesin ive got nine charges left on cabal baby  marisha oh thats magical  matt and with that knowing the circumstance vecna is going to arrange himself across the  battlefield /none/ to this side  marisha that was rough  matt all right thats going to end vecnas turn and for the sake that it is now 900 lets take a  quick bathroom break  sam what no  laura were starting up at grogs turn  matt were starting up at grogs turn well be right back here guys well see you back here in  just a minute well make it quick because weve got to rush in fast hold tight and well see  where the rest of this battle will go see you guys in a /none/ minute  break  matt and welcome back everybody before we get back into the fray the winner in the chat tonight  of the wyrmwood giveaway was twoorthreegodzillas  laughter  matt congratulations twoorthreegodzillas enjoy dividing it amongst yourselves hope its a good  time for you small box for a big creature well done so bringing it back in last we left off  vecna had just sent down another blast of arcane meteors pulled from beyond the realm slamming into  the ground and sundering many of you sending scanlan into a point of near death where /none/ he popped  back thanks to an aptly cast death ward in preparation for this combat vecnas round has  ended with him shifting over to the opposite side of the battlefield grog youre up  travis from where i was released by the eagle when scanlan changed back im 20 feet off the  deck how far if i was hereish  matt if you were here and had gone straight up then fell back down which technically would have  dealt nine points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four because youre ever raging youve landed  on the /none/ ground  travis and he is off the deck how high about now what would you ballpark it  matt vecna id say probably 80 feet from down there  travis this is one of those moments im going to hold my action until i am within melee of or  fucking closer to  matt what action are you holding  travis my attack action  sam no bonus actions  travis im a barbarian i have shit for bonus actions  sam you cant pour anything in my mouth  travis oh oh  laura thats an action /none/ not a bonus  matt to pour it into something elses mouth is an action but yourself is a bonus  sam i dont know is that right matt  travis can i take it myself with a bonus action  matt thats one of the house rules we started the campaign with up to you if you want to apply it  to scanlan  sam because you wont get any bonuses once you hold your action  travis i know i know  matt hes at one hit point on the ground  travis i dont want to /none/ take it then  laura why  matt so youre holding your attack action  travis im holding my attack action until im closer  matt okay that ends your turn at the end of grogs turn vecna will use his first legendary  action  travis tell you what ill use my movement speed to move closer to being underneath on the other  side of vax  matt okay so you move right there gotcha at the end of your turn vecna going to use two  legendary actions actually and across the way is going to glance /none/ over at the brass dragon thats  there whos flying up in the space here but all the platforms and vecna staring about at  everything on the battlefield you make me uncomfortable with your presence ancient one  and is going to cast i believe this space is large enough for gargantuan  laura is he going to try and do what he did to grog  matt nope instead hes going to create a forcecage around jmon no saving throw necessary  you watch as jmons wings through their flapping are  pulled in as a similar cage /none/ to what you saw of force energy  deeper within the tower has now encased the brass dragons form you see jmon in their devossa  form is now held within this forcecage aloft within the air the dragon begins slamming into  each side and momentarily seems to be trying to figure out a way to escape  travis are they taking any damage from banging against the cage  matt nope  laura i wonder if thats concentration too it probably is right  sam he probably can concentrate on  more than one thing  taliesin no /none/  sam no i dont know  matt so up here in this space is a brass dragon currently encased in a forcecage  travis oh i was going to be like jmon give me a ride and i forgot to say it  marisha and now you cant  travis he just got pet stored so  matt so that brings us back to vexs turn  laura okay im down there with velora can i tuck her away in a safe spot  matt you can tuck her in a place where it was once a solid piece /none/ of stone that cracked  laura under my hat definitely  matt there is an element of what was once solid packed stone that was the central column of the  tower that is now exposed broken rock and the staircase that spirals around it before it  abruptly ends and tendrils of green energy begin that hold the platforms aloft  laura and shes unconscious  matt shes dead  laura shes dead  travis oh god here we go  laura did everybody know that and i didnt know that  travis she was burning and smoking and /none/ falling  matt as you grab her body and pull up to the edge to look for a place you look down and there is no  breath  travis she took 60 plus points of damage  laura fuck  ashley we can fix her later  liam if anybody survives  laura i tuck her little body away and hope that its safe fucking shit balls can i fly back up  matt you go ahead and set her aside down below in an area where its safe and you fly up and at  your full fly /none/ speed you can get to the edge of one of these platforms  laura yeah ill hover away ill fly straight up from where i was with her  sam and attack  laura can i attack him  matt i would say to carefully set her down that would be your action and your movement but youd  get back into the fray  sam bonus action  laura i mean my bonus actions are  matt to be fair helping going after velora did manage to avoid you a impact of a meteor storm  travis that is /none/ true  laura okay tell you what he knows that im down there im sure he sees all but can i come up and  hover in the air and bonus action hide behind that wall  matt what id say is youd come up this way and hide behind the wall ill place you here but  well assume youre behind  laura do i roll for stealth  matt yes  laura did you see how that dice did that it was like fuck you 24  matt good to know that bring us at the end of /none/ your turn hes now going to spend another  legendary action to cast firebolt at scanlan  liam goddamn it  taliesin is that one legendary action or two  matt one legendary action for cantrips two for a full spell  travis and thats his third of this round  sam shit  laura so youve got one hit point now so itll knock you down  sam do i try to counterspell this  matt well youre prone so he has disadvantage on the attack roll  sam then can i do cutting words is it a melee /none/ attack  matt whats the range on cutting words  sam probably 60 feet  matt hes not within range so thats a 28 to hit  sam that misses  matt you suffer  travis one point of damage  matt 17 points of fire damage and are now unconscious once more  laura great  taliesin its fine  matt that brings us to vaxs turn  liam with my hasted action i will cast lay on hands on scanlan and bring him back up  sam great that was fast  taliesin this was not going to /none/ last long  liam hes got the book right am i within 120 feet of vecnas face  matt yes you are  liam im going to latch onto vecnas face  laura youre going to fly straight at his face  liam im going to fly straight at his face  matt okay  liam thats all my movement to get there  matt yes and youre now currently  liam on his face  matt yes on his face which in his form his head is roughly that large so youd be clutching  his ears  liam /none/ im flying right in his face  matt you can feel the crackling energy of the gaping socket where the greenish arcane bursts are  pulsing from the anger and sheer ability of his arcane prowess each one of these tendrils is  arcing around two of them crawl across you and your skin goes numb in the places where they  touch and its cold  liam i will use paladin action to daggerdagger him in the face  matt wait hold on a second you used your action to  liam hasted action  matt hasted action can /none/ only be used as an attack hide object or  liam thats fine so i use my regular action to lay on hands and my hasted action to attack him  once in the face maybe more well see  sam dont keep us in suspense for too long  liam im going to use my first luck of the night  laura oh my lord  liam bad rolls 24  matt that hits  sam took three rolls and a bonus  liam up top and im going to dump 2ndlevel smite  matt and hes undead so /none/ you get the additional smite damage  liam yeah he is motherfucker  sam pass me that not bottle of alcohol  marisha okay  travis pass the gatorade  liam i need to write this down before i forget it so before the smite its 44 and jesus im  forgetting everything 2d8 plus additional for undead which is 12 so 56 and how much extra for  the undead i cant remember 1d8 2d8  matt its an extra 1d8  liam seven  travis and liam 63  matt woo 63 points of damage as you rush /none/ up wings up before right in the face pull back and  jam your blade into the side of the skull as it hits you can see the skull crack open like a  spider web of wound as you pull the blade back you can see the sutures are already pulling  themselves together and as youre this close to him now you can see there is a slow binding of  wounds there is an element of regeneration to his body apparently in his godlike ascension the  body itself continually rebuilds  laura makes sense hes a /none/ god of course he does  marisha i mean i would want that if i was a god  laura that would be a feat i would take if i ascended to godhood  marisha definitely put that on the list  matt level six divinity ill take that feat  liam bonus action i will whisper to him no fear and stick one last dagger in his face  matt you have to roll to hit first  liam oh do i thats fine that hits thats 36  matt yeah that hits  marisha you dont crit on /none/ a 19  liam yes i do with whisper but its not whisper  matt its not whisper  liam wait  matt but you didnt throw it  liam so it is a crit  matt so the dice  liam its nothing though the damage is nothing but he does have to roll a save hell be fine or  be afraid of me  laura hes immune to fear  matt sorry buddy  taliesin did he take his bleed damage from me  matt he did the 39 points of damage  liam six big points /none/ six big points  matt thats a nasty crit  liam wait thats whisper plus 14 big points  matt 14 points so as you rush up and jam the blade in the side the second time and pull back  liam 22 points im sorry im sorry i usually throw daggers i usually dont get up on people  matt i know its all good so as you jam the second blade in and pull back he lets you draw  the blade and a grin now curls back at which point you watch as the wound that was /none/ blasted in  the shoulder pulses and you can see the gunshot wound suddenly causes some of the more bones in  the clavicle area that are now exposed from the impact crack leftover the hemorrhaging shot from  percival earlier and hes like grumble hello you can smell this wave of decay and as it  brushes past you you can actually feel this weird crawling sensation like the air itself is  beginning to pull at your flesh and thats your turn  liam yes  matt all right he is going to  liam buy me a /none/ beer  laura how do we get grog up there  sam theres a plan  laura okay sorry im sorry freaking out  sam percys building a ladder  taliesin keep him distracted  sam all he needs is a wood shop and about 25 minutes  matt vecnas going to use his last two legendary actions as you stab in the face  liam uhhuh here it is  matt as his hand comes up in front the hand which now the long skeletal fingers unwind to be  larger than the full of your entire body and /dung/ almost your wingspan its almost like the fingers  expand longer than they should and he says goodnight bitchs prince and theres like a  flash of dark and you see this wave of cold necrotic energy come to you i need you to go  ahead and roll a constitution saving throw  liam okay im above 100 so i have no idea if that has anything to do with whats going on here  matt no  sam oh no its something else  liam im going to use luck it was a good roll but im going /none/ to use luck  sam yeah  laura do you have to take it if you use luck  liam no  laura okay  liam con save  matt yep  liam 24  matt 24 does not succeed im sorry you suffer  liam ive got the necrotic armor on  matt however unfortunately the wave of energy that expanded last round 20 count negated that  so you take 36 points of necrotic damage  liam okay  matt from circle of death  laura circle of death  matt oh sorry it shouldve been an extra /none/ d6 on that so add three to that because theres 2d6  every additional spell level  liam thats fair  taliesin hes out of legendaries  matt that brings us to the 20 initiative count jmon desperately trying does not have the  spellcasting prowess of other dragons youve encountered and begins to thrust their body side  to side against the forcecage unable to escape roaring angrily within the confines of the spell  as it clusters in the entirety of this majestic dragons form into this small box held aloft in  this space to the side /dung/ of the ruined tower at this point in time you see as the spiraling  cyclone around you is whirling and you hear screeches in the distance and you watch as flying  creatures four of them begin to emerge from the sides of it you see from the back two heavily  wounded gloomstalkers giving chase to two wyverns that are damaged in their own right flying in on  the back there are two soldiers coming in as the darkness begins to fade past you can see the red  skin and dark horns the white hair of /none/ zahra riding on the side of this wyvern and behind her  kashaw riding in as well  yelling  all holy shit oh my god what the hell  liam ah this guy  yelling  sam we saw you die  will never believe it  matt you do see as they swarm in the two other gloomstalkers close behind both of them appear  at first glance they themselves are scratched you see bloodied in the faces theyve been  through an onslaught to even break through to the top of the tower as you see them /none/ ride into the  brief but crackling light from the surrounding magical aura of the tower you have seemingly a  cavalry at hand so what would you guys like to do  will my love  mary hello darling youve got a little blood all over you its all right  will you look like shit  mary thank you darling oh my god  marisha hes beauty pageant crying  mary is there anybody fallen in this my darling  matt you hear screeching behind you two of the gloomstalkers that have been chasing you have also  /none/ pushed through the cyclone seemingly unaffected by its torrent  will yeah were being followed where are we in relation to everybody  matt you guys are right here your full move was to get to that edge of the tower and right now  you each have an action what are you going to do  mary how far up is he from us  matt from each of you he would be about 55 feet  sam put on the hurt  marisha thats you thats fucking you  taliesin this is everything i wanted  mary im /dung/ going in my love i fly up within range i raise my hand i target his eye and i  cast or i try finger of death  sam yeah  matt all right so he has to make a constitution saving throw that is a 17  mary no  matt so he takes 7d8 plus 30 necrotic damage so go ahead and roll 7d8  taliesin you can use mine whatever you need i only have a couple  marisha heres some too  mary eight plus five is 13 how many do i roll seven oh shit /none/  sam youre up to 20 youre at 32  mary and one more 38 plus 30 is 68  matt 68 points of necrotic damage halved because he is resistant to necrotic damage 34  points of necrotic damage as you reach up you watch as the beam of sickly green energy slams  into the back of vecna as hes spun around you saw the eye for a second but in the flurry of  realizing youre there he spins and it manages to catch him in the back of the shoulder oh how  quaint i learned /none/ that when i was but a child  mary oh did you well its time to put aside childish things semigod  matt what are you doing kashaw  will first of all im going fuck yeah baby so is there anybody directly around vecna right now  youre on his face  matt yeah vax is flying up in his face right now  will makes things more difficult  liam could you aim for his penis  will i could but why its so pretty i think im going to do what i can first  marisha how /none/ many penises have you seen  will well different story i think id like to fly down and get closer to everybody  matt it took your full movement to get to this spot so you have your action for the turn  will who is in range for a good mass cure wounds is there anybody  matt within your current range you have percival grog and whats the range on it  will it is to mass cure is 30foot radius  liam and youre on that side  laura but mass cure you can choose a point /none/ mass cure wounds you can choose any 30foot sphere  within 60 feet of you  matt so with that you can hit either grog percy and scanlan or vex grog and scanlan  will well scanlan i know needs some help so i think were going to definitely do percy grog  and scanlan then if those are the guys that need it the most  laura yeah because you dont see me because im hidden on the other side  will im going to also for the record im going to do it as a 6thlevel spell so /none/ its going to be  4d8 instead these are the eights correct testify my friend  sam matt our young lady over here would like to bonus action something  mary if im too late can i hex him  matt you can double hex  sam oh double hex hes already hexed  taliesin i have him hexed  sam all right double hexed  matt by the way i need you to make a concentration check because you did take a  shitton of damage  taliesin i took how much damage did i take  matt it /none/ wouldve been because you took half of it so it wouldve been 60 so you have to beat a  33  taliesin what is the saving throw  matt constitution  taliesin i cant so thats fine mines gone  sam and yours is up  taliesin it is not a 20  matt all right so yeah so your hex is gone but zahras hex is up  will you guys get 20  matt 20 hit points to scanlan grog and percival all right anything with your bonus  action or you good  will can i /none/ get away with my bonus action i used my entire movement to get there didnt i so no  matt that ends your turn all right also at this point the stones begin to shift you watch  as the tether that holds the various columns begins to separate and then begin to rotate  sam wait what  matt so this island begins to move this tower begins to separate to there this begins to push  away  sam were getting farther apart  laura fuck  taliesin none of us are on these platforms though those are /none/ all skeletons  marisha im a flyer so im good  laura im hidden on the other side of the wall so would i have been sitting there on my broom  like as the wall has shifted away from me  matt yeah shifted outward like ah what  laura zahra hi  marisha shes distracted shes like yells right now  laura theres shit going on she wouldnt even have noticed me  mary my darling hello  laura hi  mary i love your hat  laura oh thank you its very hot but im going to /none/ put it on for a second because she complimented it  marisha okay in my buff michael fassbender but as a hot chick kind of way i look down and i go  grog the gymnast thing whoosh and i swoop down my speed  matt toward grog  marisha but im buff and im bigger  matt id say you need about 50 feet to get to grog 50 feet of your movement you get down to  where grog is what are you doing  marisha im going to scoop him up if he can do a little /none/ jump and whoosh  matt whats the strength of your planetar  marisha 24 strength  matt yeah you could yeah you could probably do that roll a strength check for me if you dont mind  marisha okay thats fine i rolled a nine plus seven so 16  matt so you swoop down arm underneath grogs shoulders its your action do that ill say  grab and get hold and then  marisha going the rest of my movement which you said i used 40 feet 50 so i have another 70  feet of movement  matt /none/ you get him about there  marisha can i use my bonus to dash a little further  matt i dont think you have a bonus to dash unfortunately  marisha can i because you held your action can i get up there and give him the cheerleader like  the figure skater go grog and see if i can do the you know  matt youve already used your action unfortunately that would be an action to try and  do that  laura oh thats true he does have a chain weapon  matt well say for the /none/ purposes of this  sam god so many levels  matt i know this is kind of crazy you guys are about ten feet below  marisha whats the reach on your thing can i have him on my shoulder you know once again like  the cheerleader thing ready go okay  laura can you do anything  travis not as much as i wanted to do but im not going to get any closer this round im going to  use that action to  marisha can you use your chain as a grappling hook  travis yeah /none/ but im going to take a note from zahra and im going to with the sword of kas  cast finger of death  sam oh  will wow  travis is that an attack action  matt no its casting a spell so youd have to say you were holding that  travis okay ill attach the chain of returning then and throw the sword  matt okay so as youre pulled up and youre just out of range you see the wings beginning to  falter at the end of the round you lob the sword up as /none/ youre preparing it once again the swords  voice pulses into your ears kill him take him throw me  travis just out of curiosity you cant fly or anything can you  matt no hurry  travis all right that is a 31  matt 31 hits  travis yes okay  ashley yeah  travis oh nice ten so 26  liam we love you ashley  ashley i love you guys  travis 35 39 43 43  matt 43 whew  ashley thats my boy grog  matt okay so as you swing the sword of /dung/ kas upward it lodges right into the side of the  ribcage and up into the spinal column where this little bits of hanging mummified flesh you watch  as a flash of energy hits in a blast of necrotic angry dark energy the sword immediately says in  the back of your mind yes as vecna sounds of pain grasps the blade on the other end where  its jammed through and looks down at you you can see this point of grin of youre going to  continue to be a problem wont you so the sword is /none/ embedded in his body you do see where its  embedded a secondary spark of that glowing light is beginning to emerge  laura thats good  travis its a bonus action to pull it out but i dont have one  matt you dont no its just in there  travis got a stuck vecna all right  matt keyleth end of your turn all right percival youre up  taliesin im going to take a shot at one of those nasties that have followed them through since  that seems to be a good use of my energy /none/ right now first shot is a 29 to hit  matt 29 to hit okay that hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin im going to just for fun drop two cabals ruin in there for my own amusement  matt i get a sinking sense that bones of the earth isnt going to happen  marisha im sorry  matt however if anyone wants some really cool stone pillars  marisha it changed the battlefield changed immediately  matt easy to make with a dowel and a dremel guys recommend it its great  taliesin aw now i /none/ feel bad 15 points of damage two points of psychic and six points of lightning  damage to shadowy jerk number one  matt okay as its flying screeching it looks heavily damaged its taken some hits in the fray  but its still standing its still flapping its wings it now seems to be noticing all the new  targets on the battlefield beyond the ones it was okay go for it  taliesin im shoot it again im going to drop a grit for advantage  travis kim kardashians fantasy wedding cake here  matt strangely enough thats /none/ the name for the battlefield tonight  taliesin 27 to hit im not going to drop anything into it im just going to hit him  thats nine points of damage plus two psychic damage  matt okay hits him you can see the drops of its internal fluids dropping out but its still  standing there  taliesin oh fine then im going to target the other one with another grit for advantage thats  cocked feels bad i liked that roll  marisha is that the same roll  taliesin yeah same roll counting 24  matt that /none/ hits  taliesin all right and im going to drop one two three four five points of cabals ruin into  that one drop motherfucker three four five  marisha drop it like its hot  taliesin thats ten 18 points of lightning damage 13 points of piercing damage and six  points of psychic damage  laura okay this hat is so hot  matt the other one explosion shoots blasts and you see the lightning arcing across its body  lighting up the outside of its normally almost nightmareblack flesh the smoke dissipates and  you can see /none/ blood dripping from its form black and disappearing into the sky beneath you the  wind from the cyclone whipping it out of sight still flying in space though theyre both  heavily wounded but theyre still there  taliesin fucks sake thats everything ive got right now im going to try and scoot around the  im going to get a little further back so i can grab onto that orb if things go shitty  matt scanlan youre up  marisha if we straight kill him thats no good  taliesin no he wont die youve got to /none/ trammel him you cant kill him  matt you dont know what would happen  travis its quite clear we know nothing  sam wand of fireballs can get him right  matt the range on fireball its a pretty long range im pretty sure  taliesin although you can probably hit him with it and not hit vax  sam i could hit above him  matt fireball 150 feet yeah you could totally hit him with it youre still prone on the ground  by the way  sam i will stand up  matt okay you still /none/ have about 15 ten feet of movement  sam whos near me  matt vex is behind you percys to the front and the right of you pikes above you  sam is pike within inspiring range or oh wait actually  matt might be yeah any of them would including grog and keyleth actually no because hes up  here hes out of range im sorry my bad i forgot hes right there im like this will be  enough platforms how can that possibly not be enough platforms lesson learned  sam ill use five of my seven /none/ fireball charges  matt five of your seven fireball charges puts it at a level what  sam well it starts at three and that uses one charge so four five six seven  matt okay so 7thlevel fireball dexterity saving throw from him that is a 21  sam is that my spellcasting no its a dc 15 it saves  matt so roll damage and he takes half  sam shit and its 8d6 9d6 10d6 11d6 12d6 but halved okay 14 25 that was good 40  matt 40 okay so he takes 20 points of fire /none/ damage  sam yep and ill call out i need a lift i will bonus action 2ndlevel healing words myself  matt okay  sam oh terrible okay so i get another ten points  ashley okay okay okay  all okay okay okay  sam thats it  matt all righty pike youre up  ashley okay is there somewhere i can get where i can be within 60 feet range of everybody in a  middle spot  laura youre pretty close to being that  matt yeah actually youre not that far from it if you move /none/ over to here about this space you  could probably get within 60 feet of everybody yeah  ashley okay im going to do it  laura what are you doing  ashley its time for mass heal which is 700 hit points spread out  matt vecna is going to use his reaction blowing a lets see  laura such a dick move  travis hes used all of his legendary actions  taliesin he has one last legendary resistance  matt all right so whats the spell level on that  ashley nine  matt 9thlevel spell all /none/ right so its a dc of 19 he has to roll an ability check using your  spellcasting ability which is ten so  sam i cant counterspell his counterspell  matt youre too far away from him  sam but im not too far away from her but thats not how it works okay  taliesin he has disadvantage because hes currently under hex  matt thats true so 17 natural 17 plus ten so 27  marisha thats not good  matt sighs seven plus ten thats 17 its a 9thlevel spell he needed to roll a 19 /none/ or higher  so he fails  cheering  mary hex wins again  matt well that was your hex was gone  taliesin no it was your hex  mary it was my hex  matt and you said intelligence on that one too  mary pardon me  taliesin and liam yeah  matt okay because you called hex sure  liam question im probably out of range am i in or out of range by his face probably just out  matt because you attacked physically in melee youre right in his face  liam close to /none/ pike am i 60 feet  matt oh yeah ill say so  sam all right pike divvy it up  ashley okay so zahra and kashaw i love you both  mary we dont need any darling were fine  ashley okay but im going to give all of us get 100 apiece  cheering  will good for you guys  ashley you get a hundred and you get a hundred  laura wait pike i dont need that much i only need like 20  liam does she get to choose  matt she gets to divvy /none/ up the hit points however she wants  liam vax is doing real well the temporary hit points dont come back right yeah vax is doing  real well ill take a skosh a peppering  ashley just a skosh  laura i need 20 hit points  travis and i only need 66  marisha i need a full 100 what about you  sam i need more than a hundred  marisha and you need more than a hundred but she has plenty left over percy and sam need more than  a hundred  sam how does /none/ this work matt does she know all this inherently  liam she can see how fucked up we are  laura so good you have enough for everybody to get back to max so thats the thing everybodys  back at max  liam none of the temporary hit points but your regular max  laura plus the two for the feast so  taliesin yeah your max plus two  sam and vecnas also back to full right  matt laughter everybody  sam shes really nice  matt all right so everybodys at full hit points  travis /none/ what a fucking boss  liam love your healers folks  will hug a cleric today  mary i can see the steam rising from matts head  matt all right so that finishes your turn pike  ashley trying to think if i should move a little bit  laura move get out of range of him if you can  ashley yeah im going to try to get out of range of him and closer to my peeps  matt okay so youll get down you can move about that far  marisha you have a trammel right /none/ pike  ashley oh maybe you know what im going to hang out right there maybe  marisha are we trying to get all three trammels in in one round  taliesin that would be amazing  laura thatd be killer i dont know if we can  marisha im afraid hes going to try and yank them out  matt so that ends pikes turn top of the round were back to vecna who gets his legendary  actions back  ashley oh wait wait wait is there anyone can i touch grog or is there anybody im near /none/  laura everybodys fully healed  ashley no i know but is there anybody that i can touch  matt you would be able you could fly up closer to vecna or fly lower because you moved with a  fly speed of 20  liam are you thinking of blessing grog and keyleth or something like that  ashley yeah i have a little cantrip that i was going to use but oh no never mind its not a  bonus never mind  matt okay so vecnas turn frustrated and angry as his counterspell fizzles out of his /none/  hand very well first and foremost no friends hes going to go ahead and cast a highlevel hold  monster  will its been wonderful seeing you all again  taliesin the dragon cage is not concentration is it  travis oh the energy cage vecnas energy cage is not concentration right  matt no it lasts for an hour  laura oh my god really oh poor jmon  liam the face ashley just made  ashley theyre going to be in there for a minute nobody wants that dragon in the window  matt fail and fail /none/ i need both kashaw and zahra to make wisdom saving throws please  travis the wyverns fall  will they better not fall  sam wait is he freezing the wyverns or the  matt all of them  mary im going to use luck first luck 22  matt 22  will i rolled a natural one plus four  matt the wyvern wings immediately lock in place as both of you feel your entire bodies slowly  seize up you with the wyverns plummet out of view  mary do i have a reaction  matt no you /none/ do not  liam did you just kill our guests  matt you guys plummet out of sight  laura no  marisha did you have something  sam she did have a reaction can she use a reaction  matt what reaction would you like to do  mary hellish rebuke  matt hellish rebuke youd have to take lets see here for hellish rebuke you have to be hit  first and then you return but the hold spell prevents you from actually taking any actions or  reactions  mary is it hold person or hold monster /none/  matt hold monster  mary oh im not a monster  matt its a type of here  liam youre a monster  sam it can do anything human or monster  matt its a creature you can see hold person is designated for just people hold monsters a  better version which can affect pretty much anything  mary did you affect me or did you affect my wyvern  taliesin yes  matt both  mary how can you do that  matt he cast it at a very high level  mary im going to have /none/ to leave now  travis you will be avenged  mary as before we love you guys  marisha theres a lot you can do when youre falling  will we cant even speak can we  matt no you both quietly fall off the wyvern as you plummet in silence past the edge plummeting  down the side of the tower  laura you guys got major damage though  mary at least the baby will be safe  yelling  taliesin no no  sam what baby  mary avenge us  sam what just happened  mary /none/ the three of us  sam three of us  marisha that was the worst blue balls ever  matt you get an attack of opportunity  liam oh yeah okay sneak attack on my advantage because of vow of enmity  matt you already used sneak attack before the end of your last turn  liam i have been tweeted at by eight billion people saying that on attack of opportunity on a  reaction i get sneak attack  matt youre right  liam thanks eight billion people  travis thats a lot of people they should all /none/ follow your social media accounts  ashley does anybody get an advantage after the guiding bolt  taliesin nobodys actually hit him with anything since then  sam oh oh oh i would like to know his wisdom stat please matt  laura oh you can do that  matt his wisdom is 22  sam thats what we have to beat with our trammels  travis we have to roll higher than a 22  laura well no a 22 wisdom will get him plus seven or plus six to his  sam its a dc ten plus five /none/ for each divine trammel  matt thats his wisdom score his wisdom saving throw is that what you want to know  sam yes  matt its a plus ten  sam plus ten  matt so whatever he rolls plus ten  laura so hes got to roll a 20 and then add ten to it so weve got to roll  sam wait so the trammel is a dc ten plus five for each trammel fused to the target so hes got  a plus ten to save assume that hes going to roll at least a ten /none/  travis what do we hit the trammels in with our strength  sam so we have to get all three in  laura yeah we have to get them all in  sam at least two wait is that the stat i should have asked for i think right  marisha it gives us a good answer  taliesin thats a 25 if we get all three in  liam i rolled a 34 to hit so im going to start rolling damage  taliesin thats the only thing that gives us a fighting chance  matt youre a /none/ little higher there vax  liam and ill dump smite into it as well  matt go for it so whats the total on that one the damage you just did  liam i didnt do any damage yet adding good  taliesin we get all three in and then we get one round  marisha so if we got two in then he would have to save over 20 so he would have to roll a ten or  higher  laura which is so easy  marisha we have a 5050 shot if we get two in him /none/  laura what are you doing  sam and if we get three in him 75 chance  marisha yeah but he can still save from it if he rolls a 16 17 18 19 or 20  sam and youve got to assume that hes got some feat that can get him a ten whenever he wants right  liam im calculating shit im scared to death  taliesin this is its hard to do  sam critters we love you thanks for watching the show  matt you watch as some of his wounds begin to seal up /none/ looking at him you get a sense that he  heals roughly well say for the sake of this because its the end of the game why not heals  50 hit points a round  marisha 50 hit points a round  sam we barely do 50 hit points a round  matt you guys have been doing some good damage to him  taliesin weve been hurting him  liam well i just hit him for a total with smite for a total of 65  sam dang  taliesin so thats gone  sam unless he can /none/ halve it or something  marisha oh wait you already did your action  taliesin there would be an effect if it were halved we would know you can visually see when  someone doesnt take the full damage  travis that was attack of opportunity  matt yeah you dodged away from him all right so that brings us to grog  travis so were ten feet below him  marisha how far away is he now from where we moved  taliesin he was also connected by a sword to a chain  travis oh fuck yeah thats /none/ right  matt nope i gave him a strength save to see if he managed to push the sword away natural 20 so  the sword dislodges as he yanks it out of his side it dangles the chain and you pull it back up  marisha so how far away are we now roughly  matt from him you are about id say 4050 feet  marisha we were up under him a little bit  matt you were here so youre about yeah 5060 feet from him that way  marisha if you want to hold again i /none/ can get you up there next if you want to hold your attack  action i can get you in melee range this time  travis ill use my bonus action to pull the sword back so its in my other hand i mean i could  roll for it  laura you can do finger of death this time  travis no id probably hold my attack if i hold my action i can hold one thing so ill hold  until im within melee yeah  marisha i can maybe i can do an arc and do a /none/ droppy thing on him  travis just get me to him dont drop me just get me there weve got to pull out all the stops  its all or nothing  matt all right so youre holding your action  travis yes  matt okay that brings us to end of your turn hes going to go ahead and use two legendary  actions to cast telekinesis with an extended range  sam what telekinesis whats he doing what does that do that moves things right  matt yes but he has an extended range on all of his /none/ spells because of his yeah for most of his  spells not all of them so he looks down and begins to rise his hand up you watch as the  central column begins to shift  sam whats on there  matt lift up higher and higher until about midway there  sam whats that going to do  matt going to adjust this a little bit so we can  taliesin hes going to throw a boulder at us  travis were zahra and kash petrified or  laura they were held  travis is that a concentration /none/  liam theyre going to splat  laura they fell  travis but were like 400 feet up  sam yeah but you just gave damage to vecna right did he maintain his concentration matt  liam for holding zahra and kash and the monsters because i stabbed him in the face or in  the ass as he ran  marisha how epic would that be if they ran back in  matt natural 20 they are currently now plummeting off the side you watched them  disappear from sight as he goes ahead and lifts that up it /none/ shifts up into the space well say  pike is about there all right and that is his spell  sam what is he going to do with that thing  matt so that ends grogs turn vex youre up  laura okay im going to shoot some arrows at him  matt go for it  laura am i hidden can he see me he probably can he can see all  matt he can see you you dont get sneak attack  laura of course not but my brother is not with him anymore  matt nope hes /none/ currently floating up here right now  laura cool tight all right then im going to attack him with a needle arrow natural one im  going to attack him with another  matt it fires off to the side the nerves kicking in to you unfortunately it doesnt strike true  laura well i just bundled up my sister yeah that just happened still cool im going to try  to hit him again with another needle arrow okay that probably hits yeah thats a 28  matt that hits  laura its a plus one because its a /none/ needle arrow  sam does it smell like taryon  laura yeah im going to call out for tary how about that 11 is that it  sam does he have hunters mark or anything  laura oh yeah 16 points of damage  matt 16 points of damage all righty got it all right does that end your turn  laura no im going to move im going to move around over to here  matt all right so you shift over to the side go ahead and place yourself here  laura and im still on my broom /none/  matt floating up there perfect all righty is that your turn  laura im going to use well i dont really have anything i can do with my bonus action oh no  its foreshadowing thats it  matt all right thats it at the end of your turn hes going to use two more legendary  actions as hes off on the other side and hes been lifting this large rock up into the air it  slips up higher and higher into the center space hes carefully guiding it to position as he holds  it there /none/ he glances about well it seems i assume that many of your tanks are now empty i  hate to be repetitive but im extremely frustrated with how hard it is to kill you as he  brings his hand other hand up in the air you hear an even louder tear as a third time the sky  opens up this time sending a meteor that side this side and crashing into the side here to  impact and explode in a 40foot radius up in the air above  sam oh god so he needed ground  travis /none/ thats what he was doing  taliesin he has a third spell  matt thats his third and final 9thlevel spell  sam damn  laura damn it god power  ashley thats so many 9thlevels yo  travis fail but im going to use my stones endurance to further  liam dex save right  matt dex save for everybody  taliesin we got hit by meteor again  sam any sort of advantage  travis he hit the giant platform that he was raising  marisha advantage against spell saves yeah  matt the platform is destroyed from /none/ the impact by the way so that central column is now missing  taliesin fuck me  marisha dex  liam dex save yeah youre blessed so add a d4  ashley is this also for people flying  matt yep he pulled it right up beneath you and one of the meteors slammed into  taliesin fuck man nope  matt so scanlan  sam nine  taliesin 16  marisha 20  liam 34  laura 34  travis less than 20  matt all right so that is 72 points of bludgeoning damage  sam thats not /none/ so bad right guys  marisha resisted so  matt right so half of that  marisha 72 so 34 35  matt 36 technically half of 72 no damage to you then half damage to you so take 36 you take  full percy you take the full then 65 points of fire damage  laura halved again  sam so what is that total  matt so 32 yeah  taliesin so whats the total  matt the total would be 72 and 65 that would be 137  laura he knocked us right back down  ashley /none/ is the fire halved because of the and what was the fire again im so sorry  matt so you only take 32 points of fire damage  ashley so 72  matt yeah he had other spells at his disposal but you guys kept fucking healing  travis stones endurance six plus six 12 so less 12  taliesin im okay  marisha thank god we healed we wouldve all been dead  travis so 55 points of damage  laura i mean that would have killed us right off straight up  taliesin yeah that wouldve been the /none/ end of us right there  travis fucking pike man  matt all right so that ends vexs turn vax youre up  liam okay so with a split second and that erupted all around us i have a moment to  appreciate all of this angelic fucking flexing and taking all of that damage i take out my superior  healing potion kiss keyleth on the cheek and feed her the potion thats my action my regular  action  marisha youre feeding me a potion hey babe gagging  liam then im flying eyelevel with vecna yeah am /none/ i within 60 feet there  matt youre probably a little bit closer  liam ill get a little bit closer and then i will use my hasted action to chuck a dagger at his  fucking face  marisha you fed me a superior  liam yeah natural 20 with whisper  taliesin okay weve got to start putting some trammels in this guy  marisha okay 8d4s  liam counting 64 plus the psychic 69 with whisper  matt 69 points of damage all righty  liam and i will bamf there  matt all right so with /none/ that you appear directly into vecnas face the blade still clasped in your  hand almost where you appear next to it its jammed right into the clavicle area and as it  broke through you can see the glowing energy within the ribcage flashes bright with anger as  the eye bursts forth where once it was this crackling arcane energy theres now a visible giant  green flame billowing out like an angry fire flames crackling  laura youve got one  liam i do but its weak ill use my last bonus action to stab again with /none/ whisper 28 to hit  matt hits  liam counting 20  matt 20 points of damage will be the final attack all right that ends your turn all right  so whos at low hit points  sam everybody  travis no  marisha what constitutes as low  matt well here how many hit points do you have  sam are you going to use it to kill me matt  matt vecna can see through your physical forms  sam 32 hit points  taliesin 59  marisha 131  liam 129  laura 70  travis /none/ 224  ashley 36  matt 36 all righty all right hes going to use his third or sorry his final legendary action  for this round to cast firebolt at you scanlan  sam i cannot protect against that i have no counterspell that reaches him right  matt at this moment no that is an eight plus 16 that is a 24 to hit  sam that hits  matt all right you suffer 23 points of fire damage  sam great  matt all righty so at the end of vaxs turn that brings us to the /none/ 20 initiative count at this  point in time  travis jmons still in the cage  matt jmon is smashing into the sides of the forcecage and looking around at the rest of you  guys unable to escape  sam doesnt have teleport  matt not all dragons are spellcasters  travis and we cant dispel it right ill dispel it  matt all right so five skeletons rise up from the ground  liam oh no  travis around scanlan  liam oh death saves handing out death saves  marisha why are they all around scanlan /none/ percys there  liam theyre getting ready to do the finishing move on him  laura theyre going to try to take him out  liam take him out and then stab him while hes down  matt so first attack natural two that misses second one natural four thats 11  sam nope  matt third attack natural two luck is working in your favor so far fourth attack thats going  to be a 19  sam that hits  matt six points of slashing damage  taliesin youre still up  matt final attack is six plus /none/ seven thats 13 whats your ac  sam 14  matt oh shit so these skeletons are swarming you hacking and swinging away trying their best  to finish you off and you barely dodge through some of them  laura hes so little the skeletons are swinging above him  sam im at three  matt at this point in time you glance over and see a fist grab the rock side of one of these  platforms  sam no it doesnt  matt you watch as a second gauntleted fist hits the side and climbing up over /none/ the edge of one of  these platforms you see immediately the redscaled face and horned body of a heavilywounded but  stillliving arkhan making his way up onto the platform  cheering  taliesin oh lets go this is on its fucking on  marisha youre not going to kill another of our friends in front of us are you  liam vox machina this is your life  joe you didnt think i was going to miss this party did you sorry i was late  marisha joe dont die  matt you watch as one of the /town/ hands removes itself from the building and you can see this  translucent set of chromatic wings that are drifting off of the giant armored dragonborns  shoulders  laura youve got wings  joe i had a flight potion red bull  marisha gives you wings  joe thank you mike mearls by the way  sam brobarians  joe the bros are back  travis lets go  marisha singing the bros are back in town  matt what do you want to do it took most of your flight to get to this point you have another /none/  action though  joe i have another action  matt well you have an action and a bonus action  laura where are you at arkhan  taliesin right down there  joe im down on the ground  sam super far from the guy  joe i am super far okay did my friend get my signal  matt he hasnt arrived yet  joe okay  sam whispers thats what he calls his dick  joe then i guess im going to  matt there are still two gloomstalkers also that are about to take their turn /none/  joe okay so i can fly 60  matt yes but youve used your movement youd have to use your action to dash  joe use my action to get up there okay then i am going to get within okay 60 and a bonus  action so could i get up to him and then use a bonus attack  matt hes unfortunately more than 60 feet away from you yeah you can get to about this point  with a full 60 movement  sam can you throw anything cast anything  joe i could throw a /none/ javelin one of those fun little javelins  sam theres also a bunch of popup undeads around us if you want to mop them up  joe how high is he up from about there  matt at a glance close to 80 feet  joe 80 okay then ive got to get up to where pike is  matt okay so dash action using these chromatic wings granted by the flight potion and the  dramatic effect of tiamats blessing you manage to glide up next to pike both of you with your  very opposite visual of godgranted /none/ wings side to side you see pike with singe marks on her face  her hair tousled the bludgeoning causing blood to pour from the side of her ears and the corner of  her mouth you look over at arkhan next to you part of his flesh has been necrotically burned  away and you can see heavy wounds it looks like hes sustained a bit of a heavy fray with the  death knight but hes not being followed at the moment  joe so i hold up the helmet of the death knight and the head of /none/ delilah and drop them down into  the crack in front of them and i guess im going to try to throw a javelin  matt as a bonus action  joe as my frenzied bonus action  matt okay yeah  travis hell yeah why not we got it man  joe okay thats a 20 to hit  matt 20 to hit unfortunately it hits the front of vecnas body and you watch as the javelin  splinters apart into a hundred different pieces of wood and metal  joe javelins not so good  sam you got /none/ any healing you got any bonuses you got anything  joe not like the healing bonuses reactions  travis we look like healing bonus people to you  matt both of these guys arc upward gloomstalkers this guy here is going to shriek  he gives out this horrible sound as it swings out i need wisdom saving throws from both  scanlan  laura were immune to fear and you have advantage on any wisdom saving throws  matt this isnt a fearbased thing  taliesin is it magic  matt it is magic  taliesin all right so /none/ i have advantage natural 20  travis come on snitch more of that  sam 13  matt okay wait you have freedom of action cast on you right  sam yeah freedom of movement  matt its a paralyzation effect it has no effect  taliesin yeah i cant be paralyzed anyway  matt nope so this one however is going to land and is going to try make

going to bring us to keyleth  marisha okay still in our synchronised swimming stance i fly up and  matt so you fly up from this point got to pull you up a bit  marisha im going to drop grog onto vecna and then /none/ do my own thing  matt okay so you fly up grog what are you doing at this point  travis im going to use that held action to attack twice  matt okay youll be falling if she drops you  travis no my first attack is going to be a grapple and with the second attack im going to  shank him  matt roll an athletics check  marisha can i give him a little bit of a boost  matt yeah totally  marisha okay  travis 23  matt 23 rolled a 16 plus five /none/ thats a 21 so you succeed  sam wait hes grappled  matt well i mean grappled is not going to stop him  sam hes immune to grapple  matt no hes not immune to grapple but it does not stop his movement because of his size but  youre attached to him so currently at the moment you are locked into vecnas current  little ill put you there  laura just hanging out  travis and instead of a d10 ill hit him with a onehanded versatile d8 reckless natural 20  cheers and laughter  sam /none/ is that a  liam and travis natural 20  sam thats a crit thats a critical roll  marisha oh man it took 114 episodes that we finally have a title name drop in our show its a  critical roll  matt its just crazy  sam trammel that shit  travis 14 plus 12 help me  liam 26  travis 26 thank you 26 plus 14 is  joe 40  sam oh shit  liam youve said that like 17 times  sam ive had advantage on all saving throws this whole time and i /none/ havent been using it  joe how many of those things do you have  sam from the blessing of the knowing mistress  marisha dont forget your blessings  sam that wouldnt have been any better  travis 58 64  matt 64 with a onehanded strike right just a d8  sam oh is that necrotic what is it bludgeoning  travis 68 76  matt its the brutal critical right  travis theres one more after the 76  matt well its only two dice technically because you took levels in fighter that was my  fault /none/ last time  travis 81  matt 81 points of damage  sam how much were necrotic  matt none of them its all slashing sword of kas  travis one thing  matt kill fucking vecna as keyletar lifts and thrusts you upward you reach out and as vecna  tries to dodge out of the way you manage to grab onto the side of the ribcage as youre clutching  on the side of it and by the way the rib itself is this wide around your hand although with your  titan form your fingers barely close /none/ around it you swing and dangle and as you do you take the  blade and jam it right up into where the force of the greenish energy in the chest where the ribcage  is and as you strike it theres a burst of energy out from inside out of him and vecna  screams as the sword at the back of your mind goes yes you guys watch at this point to those  who are close by the red glow of the coallike glow in grogs eyes the vampiric eyes are flaring  now as the anger /none/ of the sword is now synchronizing with his hatred as you jam it inside the burst  pushes the blade out but now you can see another little sparkle of light within the inside of that  pulsing glow in his chest you can see now three distinct currently available weaknesses in his  avatar form however he will continue to heal and if he heals those begin to close so yes  marisha okay so after he does that keyletar is going to swing around and find another one of  those openings and im going to take my /none/ greatsword and do my multiattack and jam it right into one  of his openings and open it up a little wider got to get it nice and good  matt go for it  marisha okay getting it nice and good okay so first attack opal dice dont fuck me you  always fuck me 18  sam you get a plus four on something right  marisha yeah on attacks too gasps 22  matt 22 just misses his ac is 23  marisha we learned something second attack got to roll better than a fucking four that /none/  definitely hits  matt all right so go and roll your damage on that  marisha okay 4d6 plus seven and then i get 4d6 i dont do this normally okay six ten 15 plus  another 5d8 radiant damage  sam ooh thats a lot  marisha mmhmm because im a planetar  sam pat planetar  marisha not bad eight five is 13 another seven is 20 ones not for sword damage 22 and another  six 28  laura 28 plus 15  matt 28 plus 15  joe thats 43  matt ooh 43 points /none/ of damage so as you strike with the first swing of the greatsword as it  strikes across it hits the side of the armor and bones and cleaves off no impact but you use that  momentum to swing it around and jam it up towards one of the open wounds right where the blast in  the shoulder was that percy left earlier and was then opened by the rest of the party as you jam  it inside you can feel the heat of the bursting arcane energy from the inside of his body his  avatar /none/ form fighting with every bit of impact and the proximitys almost beginning to hurt your  face but as you can see a pretty decent wound  marisha all right thats my turn i guess  laura oh you have to take 4d6 radiant damage because you hit me with a meteor shower  matt thats true you can roll that for me  sam this guys getting hurt  taliesin yeah but he keeps healing  marisha and taliesin trammel time  ashley is he looking rough  laughter  matt other than those openings on his body doesnt /none/ look too bad but he looks pretty rough to  begin with because hes a lich its hard to tell  laura ten damage radiant damage  liam and marisha stop trammel time  matt all righty that ends keyleths turn percival youre up  taliesin im in melee with this thing im going to take a shot at him with the sword im going to  give it a swing well this is fine its my sword so its a 21 to hit  matt that hits go and roll damage  taliesin all right im going to drop /none/ two points of cabals ruin or at least one point of cabals  ruin i want to try and end this shit  marisha who are you fighting the zombies  taliesin no the birds thats 13 points of damage plus one lightning  matt okay as you swing the sword around you see it bite at you and you take your hand using  diplomacy as a gauntlet to protect you you grab the side of its face and push the snapping jaws to  the side and using that opening you take the blade and slip it up /none/ into its throat and it  immediately collapses you duck out of the way as its body falls lifeless to the ground  taliesin next thing im going to do is take a shot at that terrible thing over there and im  going to burn a grit for advantage and hopefully get it back by killing it dead here we go thank  god i did because that was terrible 25 to hit and im also going to put one more cabals ruin  into that just to put him down  travis its a good system right  /none/ joe im in shock  taliesin thats 16 points of damage two points of psychic damage and two points of lightning  damage  matt the second one has suffered enough damage to be picked off and part of its jaw gets blasted  off and it melts into that liquid black smokelike disappearing ether  taliesin for my third action oh god im going to run down a little bit im going to try and get  three of these guys in a line  matt okay so youre moving down this way  taliesin just a little bit /none/ im going to be one space away im not going around that way but im  going to try to back around  matt this way okay yeah you can move over here  taliesin i dont want to get too far away because im not done with my movement im trying  to get the shot as i run  matt thats 20

enough to take them out the first one is destroyed and the damage is  maintained roll for the hit on the next two  taliesin thats 22 to hit and then dear fucking god  laura oh no scanlan  matt i know

various spinal columns causing them  to shatter across the stone and slide off the side  taliesin im going to /none/ run in next to scanlan and as my bonus action hand him a superior healing  potion can i not get quite there oh in that case if i didnt have time keep a little closer  to the orb  marisha the most expensive healing potion  sam is it organic  taliesin in that case for my bonus im going to take a healing potion what is a superior worth  laura 8d4  marisha 8d4 plus eight  joe i know because i took one on the way up after the death knight  matt all right /none/ so as youre doing this percival scanlan you glance down and can see  into the city of vasselheim at this point large columns of smoke are spilling up from the city  you can see at various temples there appear to be various clusters of divine energies beginning to  emit it looks like there are clerical groups that are in the process of trying to conjure or find  ways to protect the city but at that moment you can see a dozen or so angelic entities that have  been summoned by one of these temples swarming /none/ in as about 25 gloomstalkers swipe in and they begin  to harry each other at that moment you watch as a giant arm of the titan swings upward and  annihilates pretty much all of them in one swing gloomstalkers and devas alike all smashed and  scattered in one swipe of the arm as another one immediately with the momentum slams down into the  city of vasselheim and the whole area below begins to shake though you guys are currently  tethered by these platforms you dont feel the impact but you see the city around and /none/ hear the  empty echoing impact of that fist on the ground  liam screams of thousands  matt yes all right that ends percys turn scanlan youre up  sam im up  matt yep

skull and temple as it /none/ buries in  you can feel the flames from the impact burning around your fingers as if the very surface of the  sun is threatening to burn your hand off the pain is extreme but you push through it and as you  jam it you can feel it spiraling in and you turn it and twist as it digs in vecna roars gives  out this horrible screaming yell and as it pulls in you watch as the very end of it seems to glow  with this bright yellowish sunlike light its locked into place  travis /none/ oh shit  marisha oh my god weve started this  travis that was one i have another attack

joe does the necrotic double because its double all dice  matt oh for the critical the dice would as well  joe the dice would as well okay great all right  sam what do you think it looks close i dont know though  joe 50 plus five points of necrotic which doubles to ten  matt brings it back down to five he is resistant to /none/ necrotic damage so each of these necrotic hits  are doing less damage

a camera so we can put this in the scrapbook later  taliesin no its okay  sam sorry bud  travis 33 hand stay on him  matt hand stays on him yeah  travis okay cool thats just my reaction  joe you trying to chop off his hand  travis yeah thought id maybe luke skywalker his hand  matt that ends vecnas turn he seems extremely frustrated  taliesin and he just took from me because i /none/ took my shots it was 26 damage plus one psychic for  the first one goddamn it the other one hits and again goddamn it 24 damage plus one psychic and  the third shot probably does not hit third shot does not hit  matt okay gunshots everyones swarming up around him and each time he tries to cast a  spell even in his current divine form hes growing more and more frustrated you can see now  as this hulking entity is still bursting into vasselheim and destroying you can see a moment of  panic in /none/ a fresh gods eyes ends vecnas turn grog youre up  travis with all the rage ive ever had i will reckless attack grab the trammel from pike and  aim it right in his stupid chest  matt go ahead and make a strength check grog  travis yeah enough inspiration because fuck it why not yep thats 33  laura you dont get that because its strength  travis oh right 33  laura hes marking off a resistance you just did that didnt you  matt thats actually not what i did but you can think what /none/ you want all right so whats the  grand total on that  travis 33 was the total  matt 33 as you take the trammel grabbing the bottom of the ribcage curving it underneath you  thrust it up into the core center it seems of his chest where the avatar arcane energy is  amassed and as the trammel squeezes in you hear the guttural rage from the inside of vecna  screaming you dare and as he inhales the force of the voice is pulled back into a moment of  weakness and once again you can /none/ see the fear flickering in the eyes the burning rage of the  green flame begins to diminish ever so slightly as the second trammel is applied  travis cool im going to keep hitting him i have my hasted attack  matt you dont have a hasted attack it faded  travis oh thats right sorry yeah my bonus action is a straightup reckless 17 thats a  million 35 is to hit eight 24 32 42 enlarge 44  matt as youre cutting through the body you see bits of vecnas avatar form tattering and falling  apart /none/ i would like you to make an intelligence check  sam 22  matt you were told and knew that you could not kill a god a god that ascended from a lich form  generally has the capability if the body is destroyed to reform elsewhere you begin to get  the sense that at a certain point if you end up destroying this avatar form it might ruin  everything  sam as in dont use the book  laura as in dont keep attacking him  sam as in dont kill him  laura if we keep /none/ attacking him hes going to take too much damage  marisha the trammels are in  sam the two trammels are in he has one more legendary save  joe read the book  travis literally its all we got  liam its reading rainbow time  joe time to cross the streams  taliesin if were not careful this gets worse  sam is someone before me  matt grog that ends your turn

the woman that i love im going to see  grog im going to see arkhan im going to see my friend scanlan and then im going to dig into  vecnas eye and stab away  laura dont do too much damage  liam its

 liam should /town/ i reroll  matt actually for grapple it may just be athletics let me doublecheck here  liam two rolls here unused  matt its an athletics check so roll athletics  liam that is a 22  matt 19 plus five 24 grapple fails  liam all right that was my  clattering over skype  laughter  ashley i was getting a tissue and i dropped a fork  liam that was my hasted action im going to stay here and fucking hug vecnas face  matt all right that brings us to the 20 the buildings shift /none/ back once more across the ground  these begin to rotate and spread outward this way that one merely stays where it is at this point  in time arkhan  joe so we dont want to do any more damage  taliesin no  joe all right im going to attempt to grapple his arm with that hand on it  matt okay  joe thats good thats a natural 19 what would i add proficiency plus strength  matt this would be on a grapple thats athletics check  joe oh athletics check  travis i dont think /none/ the hand comes off unless the person goes  joe 30  matt okay and that was a 19 so you are currently grappling the hand  joe okay and thats my whole action  matt thats an attack to grapple  joe attack oh attack what do i do with my other attacks hold theres no way to twist the  hand off he tried he tried it before  matt its on there pretty tight its not just a hand you can cut off its an artifact its  returned to its original owner  marisha i would /none/ be dropping my planetar shape which is making me fly right now  joe can i hold my bonus  matt no its an action  joe im out  matt spent your turn yeah  joe is there a way to pull him down  matt not at this size and the fact that youre flying there hes too big  joe all right then im going to hang just going to grapple  matt that brings us to keyleth  sam what you got girl  laura can you grapple him  sam grapple and pull him down /none/  marisha okay yeah ill take the other side that arkhan has not grab the other side of him and try  and grapple him leaving him open and available for scanlan  matt make an athletics check  sam you have no spells that dont do damage nothing that holds nothing that silences nothing  that feebles not as keyleth  marisha im a planetar if i drop this then i fall what am i doing athletics check  matt the current avatar form looks like its  joe its about to go  matt its pretty bad  /none/ taliesin yeah we do not want to kill him  marisha oh i had bonuses to saving throws that i didnt even fucking realize its pretty good  23  joe sorry on saving throws anyone within ten feet of me gains plus four  matt so you now have arkhan grappling a hand you have grog grappling the side of the torso  keyleth you turn over and grapple part of the body you guys are basically holding vecna at bay  at the moment  sam we can always bring you back  matt is that your turn /none/ keyleth  marisha i dont even know what i have that would make him burn it i dont really have anything i  dont think he would go for it  taliesin this just means we have to live through one roll im holding my action for any movement  or anything that he may do im holding my action for signs of life  matt scanlan its your turn  sam chapter one the rites of banishment are ancient and powerful they cannot be stopped by  anyone not even a god i read i read powerfully and strong /none/  matt all right hes going to make his wisdom saving throw with a dc 20 because of two trammels  that is a 17 hes going to use his last legendary resistance to succeed  taliesin next round  matt the text goes blurred to you on the book so you cannot read it for a full round somebody else could  marisha a full round  joe what is the basis of reading that thing  sam someone needs to cast a 3rdlevel spell on it  laura i have 3rdlevels left  matt its still glowing the /none/ text is glowing for an hour  marisha its an arcane thing though right  sam i cant read it but other people can  matt once youve put the spell slot into it the text becomes visible  laura which you did  sam i did that  matt correct  taliesin so now you can only try and read it anybody can try and read it any six seconds as  long as it what language is it again  joe if you fail then you cant read it for a round  matt is anybody else here /none/ trained in arcana  liam trained in arcana  marisha that was what i was asking none of us are unless you are arkhan  joe arkhan does not have an arcana  marisha so we have to hold this motherfucker down for a round  matt you do  sam is pike no shes divinely  matt i dont know pike are you trained in arcana do you have proficiency in arcana  ashley i dont know i dont think so  joe anyone else intelligent whats that  travis youre grappling him too right  taliesin so long /none/ as you guys all hold  matt this text is far too illegible for somebody who isnt trained in arcana  marisha hang on is it something i can do as a planetar that can read all languages and is also  telepathic  matt planetars can read all languages  marisha yeah  matt you can certainly try  laura give it a try keyleth because what difference does it make you have nothing to lose  matt so at the end of scanlans turn  sam wait is anyone else  marisha i can read all languages as /none/ a planetar  joe its like the scene in monster squad when the kid goes is she a virgin  matt at the end of scanlans turn  sam i cast my bonus action inspiration on keyleth  matt okay how do you inspire her  sam singing heres the story of a lovely druid who thought she could fly as a goldfish  but she couldnt and she became fish paste and i wish i had wish  matt take your d12 inspiration die  marisha okay i have it now  matt okay end of scanlans turn going /none/ to use two legendary actions to attempt to cast dominate  person  taliesin can he do it without arms  matt well not both arms are currently grappled to the point where the arms cant move  taliesin okay because theres a lot of people grappling him  matt hes also a very big guy grappling is more of holding onto him and preventing him from  moving but he can still move its a hard thing its a little wishywashy at this size all right  so scanlan i need you to make a wisdom saving throw  /none/ sam ill cast counterspell  matt at what level  sam three  matt okay go ahead and roll  shouting  taliesin what  marisha for no reason  joe scanlan has had the craziest last hour ever  taliesin cant deal  liam oh my god  joe you just killed dude  marisha oh my gods oh my pelor oh my sarenrae  matt so now its pikes turn pike your turn  ashley okay am i close to keyleth at all  matt yeah youre actually right up there with keyleth  ashley okay im going /none/ to float by keyleth  matt what are you doing  ashley im going to float by keyleth cast guidance on her  matt okay  ashley and as a bonus action cast sanctuary on her  matt okay all right that finish your turn pike  ashley yes  matt all right  ashley can i move again  matt you can move if you want  ashley i want to move close to grog  matt okay thats easy enough you guys are all clustered around him okay that ends pikes turn  end of your turn hes /none/ going to use two more legendary actions to attempt to cast 4thlevel  banishment on scanlan hes running through what things he can  marisha 4thlevel banishment on scanlan  matt all right make a charisma saving throw please  marisha come on charisma  liam burt reynolds do it  sam 30 im charisma as fuck  laughter  joe this is craziness  sam first roll two second roll 18  joe we got to go to vegas after this is done  matt top of the round vecnas turn legendary actions are returned at this point now /none/ the titan  has waded into the center of vasselheim each progressive round its been this one footstep  after the other you can hear screams and yells but you also see the divine temples in the  distance are beginning to summon various bits of divine energy from those in the clerics that  reside within the city you can see a storm has now merged with the darkness that vecna has spread  over the city and lightning bolts are beginning to be brought down in a familiar crack that you  heard when you were battling groon /none/ as you can see now the acolytes of the recently fallen trial  forge are bringing their rage down upon the exterior of this entire swarm of gloomstalkers and  the titan  vecna is going to try again hes going to cast another banishment on scanlan would you just be  rid of me finally go die make another charisma saving throw  travis does vecna have to speak to cast banishment  sam not good not good both  joe does anyone have anything that negates  taliesin you can inspire yourself  matt well not for a /none/ saving throw he cant what did you roll  sam 18  matt scanlan with the book vanishes from sight at this point vecna whos being held by all  chuckles come on show me what youre worth  travis ill do that right now ill use my reaction against mage slayer and im going to  punch him in the face just punch  matt at this point you watch as one of the titans arms is now rising up over the tower you  get the sense hes getting really desperate  travis oh jesus just trying to /none/ break concentration so im going to punch  sam do what youve got to do  matt go for it grog  travis reckless  matt as vecnas lifting his right hand up even in the grasp you can see the titans arm rising  up like its being puppeteered by vecna as it puts another shadow down upon the top of entropis this  large multihundredfootwide ram of sheer rock all right  travis 25 to hit 1d4 three plus eight  matt total damage is  travis 11  matt 11 okay  travis hes got to roll /none/ at disadvantage  matt he does 12 and 12 plus seven each so yeah he succeeds thats the end of vecnas turn whos  locked in place now its your turn grog  taliesin he has healed 50 though in theory  matt he did he healed 50 hit points in the last turn  sam so hit him 50 points grog  travis all right ill hit him with the sword of kas reckless thats a critical that was a 19  im not used to hitting on those oh shit  laura oh no just the one to /none/ break his concentration  sam roll high  travis i already rolled high  liam close your eyes

so thats 4d4  matt are you going to /none/ move as well  laura yes whoa thats good 11 plus four is 15 to me and then im going to run over to percy  and im going to hold his hand  matt just enough movement to come over and hold percys hand  laura but im going to keep looking up at whats going on up there  matt okay as you guys stand there looking up hand in hand glaring as scanlan reappears in  place and with the shadow now looming over entropis in a long line across the city of thar  amphala as /none/ this massive titan arm is rising up thats going to end that vax what are you  doing  liam okay i would like to cast compelled duel on vecna its a long shot but im going to do it  marisha the fuck is that  liam one creature that you can see within range must make a wisdom saving throw on a failed save  the creature is drawn to you compelled by your divine demand  joe its a weird paladin spell  travis theres always a one out there  liam so i would like to /none/ do it  matt all right that is a 24  liam sure okay so that didnt work for my action i would like to steal a bonus kiss from  keyleth of the air ashari  matt i dont believe youve kissed her in her keytar form so its a new experience for you  liam every different form male female big tall small whatever im in love and i would  like to use my regular action to fly in front of scanlan shorthalt five feet in front of him and  splay my wings as wide as /none/ they can and flip the double birds to the biggest dick on the fucking  planet  marisha air horns  liam in front of scanlan  matt the tape is wearing off its worked well enough for most of it vecnas going to take  attack of opportunity on you as you rush by  liam good  joe can he take an attack of opportunity physically with me hanging onto his hand and her  on the other hand im just along for the ride  matt youre swung along as he strikes screams swing in place thats /none/ going to be a ten there we  go 27  liam that hits ill use uncanny dodge to reduce it to half  matt okay all right that is 24 points of cold damage and youre immune to paralysis so it  doesnt do anything else all right arkhan  joe okay everyones appeared im grappled theres nothing to be done here can i hold  movement or is it hold action  matt just an action  sam you have to name the action  joe okay i will hold my action in case he disappears  matt /none/ okay keyleth its your turn  marisha okay i fly down over scanlans shoulder and attempt to read the damn book  matt you probably have to take the tome from him to read it  joe wings in front wings in back this is crazy this is a cool tableau  matt scanlans being held up by bigbys hand in the center blackwinged angel of fate and death  on one side the whitewinged planetar of keyleth representing life on the other  marisha with antlers always antlers  matt you take the book from scanlan you spend your /none/ action to try and read it  laura and liam yes  matt which you can because your planetar form  marisha do i get anything what do i do  sam nothing  marisha ive got inspiration and d4 right  matt you just read it its his saving throw  marisha he saves  matt he saves you just read it you begin to recite from the text like scanlan did as the  mysterious words begin to emit from the  travis what is it  matt let me take a quick picture of this  marisha /none/ what does that mean its always good or bad  music  taliesin should be texting that fast  matt as you read from the book page after page the words come out something you dont seem to  understand in your mind but the form understands and as it does the runes glow you look up as the  trammels begin to glow one two you hear this sucking sound  how do you guys want to do this  shouting  laura oh my god  matt describe your support of this you guys are holding vecna back /none/ how do you prepare for this  as hes currently being held by these trammels in place  laura i grab percy up on the broom so we can fly up  travis i take out the immovable rod out of the bag of holding and i put the heel of my hand  against the trammel as it starts to push just to help it  liam i grab scanlan like a football for old times sake and i come up behind keyleth and i  kiss her on the cheek and stare forward  marisha we all spoon /dung/ each other as a winged spooning circle while holding scanlan while  holding the book  sam bigbys hand is gently tickling my taint  laughter  travis i make sure pikes with me over here  ashley yeah i fly up next to grog and if he has a free hand i hold the other hand  travis yeah i hold hands with pike  matt as you guys are there clutching him in this form you watch as suddenly the dark clouds above  begin to part directly above the tower as the titan arm is lifted up /none/ and beginning to make its  way down in your direction as the shadow strengthens the trammels explosion in the side  of the head no too long too long agonized yell as they suddenly vibrantly brighten you  watch as the lattice of the divine gate begins to spread out around his body the energy begin to  consume his form and within one bright fiery sun explosionlike flash and a sound like a  deafening thunderclap not feet from where your body is all of you are thrown from the detonation  as vecna claps out of existence /none/  you all begin to fall as the entirety of the field dissipates around thar amphala the first sunlight  probably ever to really touch the city hits as you watch waves of gloomstalkers dissipate as the  cloud slowly pulls away the large titan arm grinds to a halt from above as its entire undead  body halts locked in place the magic that maintained it no longer of this plane  you fall there is a platform not too far from you i would like those who were clasping on to  vecna to make a strength saving /none/ throw to try and capture yourself on the edge  joe is anyone within ten feet of me  laura grog and pike are  joe you get a plus four  travis sick  ashley am i rolling as well  matt youre flying youre fine  sam can jmon catch anyone  matt unfortunately the force cage is still in place it lasts for an hour  travis i rolled a 22  matt 22 okay  joe 17  matt okay you both manage to barely catch on to the edge the strain is immense and you /none/ both  still manage to suffer 23 points of general strain damage technically its the fall damage but you  caught yourself you barely pull yourself back up onto these platforms the tethers still remain  holding it but you dont know how long itll be there as the energy is subsiding around this  tower  you all take a moment to imagine what youve lost what youve gained everything has led to this  moment and in the quiet and the stillness you hear a new sound its thousands and thousands of  distant voices cheering from the /none/ city of vasselheim below of wyvern and eagle riders above  you but a small example of the hundreds of thousands of lives you may have saved  laura im staring at vax  marisha same holding on desperately  matt

technically  matt yeah  laura oh my god  ashley ugh  liam we would have had to have done five more games for this thing to end  matt this would have gone into a few more sessions and he would have
