taliesin yes  liam and sam  sam /dung/ was not expecting this to be white  laughter  liam you guys live the life of voice actors in los angeles so you get to beat the heat you  spend most of your days in supremely air conditioned recording studios you hide away in  your dark little hidey holes and today youre double lucky because not only do you get to hide  from the heat you get to work with three of your bestest friends in the whole wide world thats  right the four of you guys have been working for the last six to /none/ nine months really on the latest  game by phalanx studios youre working on the third in the felguard series youve been doing  performance capture for months  laura ugh so hot in this mocap suit  sam you know what its worth it for number three felguard iii  laughter  liam but you know most of the performance capture is behind you youve done all the  principal stuff you probably returned for pickups but now were moving into the voice over  leg of the journey and today youre kicking off your first day of serious /none/ vo on the job youre  going to have several days this week and you are headed to good old warner brothers studios  laura are we talking battle chatter  liam no no no its traversal its the connective tissue between cut scenes  travis are we hoping to see the water tower when we arrive  liam how can you not see the water tower when you arrive at the wb its on the lot  sam by the way this is a setting that everyone watching can identify with youre on the warner  brothers lot  /none/ taliesin i want to run to my car and get my id badge  liam have you guys have seen animaniacs you know all you need to know youve all had busy  mornings travis you had a home workout you worked out and did whatever strong people do ive  read about it i dont know

you had a /none/ 900 to 100 youve got to rush over for a  200 to 600 you work two sessions a day seriously is this game over yet taliesin youve  been at home writing all day on a totally unrelated project  taliesin oh why would i do that  liam well because its anime and that goes deep with you somebodys got to adapt that shit but  you get to work on this fucking aaa game felguard iii youre going to go do some vo youre heading  over now sam is rushing over obviously from one of the /none/ like 37 animated series ive lost track  by now youre barely going to make it on time got a little wrinkle though well its a heat  wave right and your air conditioning broke and your neighbors had just gone on vacation and given  you their dog bixby hes a pug hes staying at your house but you cant leave bixby in the house  when its that hot you took him to work which is fine when youre directing i dont know how it  would go in the booth  sam is he a quiet dog /none/  liam hes generally pretty quiet  sam all right ill take him and well hope that the directors cool with it  liam hes fucking adorable anyway you all roll up you come through the gate you park under that  iconic water tower sam ten minutes after everybody else  laughter  liam you hit that air conditioning it feels so good to get out of there boosh you cool down  hey guess who the voice over director is  travis who  liam liam obrien your old friend liam obrien that lovable idiot here he is /none/ hes going to  direct you hes taken over for the voice over leg of felguard iii  laura this is really really weird  liam yes it is youre seeing some people for the first time in a while other than liam who you  see pretty regularly you go downstairs obviously pierce otoole is there iconic red  woolen zissou cap on big beard and his tie love him emma stops in for a minute but briefly  sam can you do an emma impression  liam i think im going to steer away from that  laughter /none/  liam and your engineer today is allen the devs are there too three of the devs from phalanx are  there they were all there on the set you know them really well jenna the writers there she  comes in and says oh my god travis i played ragnarok you were such a beast in that game and  a different kind of beast than from ours i mean its so stupid i work in games but i hear you  guys sometimes im like god i didnt even know it was him i didnt know it was /none/ you  travis thats our ultimate goal so it really makes me happy to hear that we were able to  confuse the ear one performance to the next thanks  liam and the director garrett who was on set as the director comes over to you and is like  dude youre not going to believe the scenes are coming back i mean its at 80 its not fully  rendered and everything  laura hows it looking  liam the sword work you did looks fucking youre a monster  laura thats great because i barely trained and /none/ i was floundering on the set  liam hows that bruise  laura oh no its totally fine its barely seeable i totally wont sue the company or  anything  liam so just so you know when we get in there today i know that liams taken over but we  talked about that edge you have hold onto that edge  laura yeah i wont pay attention to what hes saying dont worry  liam all right also the audio lead is there and hes eyeing the dog his name is gus and i  just want to /none/ make i mean is it normal to bring dogs to recording sessions  sam im sorry about this gus im in a pickle and my friend left me this dog and i dont want  the dog to die obviously  liam liam chimes and says well is he quiet or is he going to  sam from what ive seen hes a pretty quiet dog weve really grown quite close over the last  few  liam is he more likely to bark if hes apart from you because we also dont want him barking  in here if /none/ hes away from you  sam you know what if i could take him in the booth with me then gus if youre allergic you  dont have to worry about it itll be near me and that would be great  liam well liam turns to the rest of the guys and says well well just give it a minute and if  its a problem well figure it out but if you say thats hes good whats his name  sam his name is bixby  liam hey bixby cooing noises  laura dont give him chocolate liam /none/  liam okay  laughter  liam why would i give a dog chocolate thats a stupid idea allen takes you in are you going to  be sitting or standing  laura im going to be standing  liam okay so he walks person to person and adjusts all your microphones pierce pops in and  goes guys can i get you any coffee or tea  sam ill take a tea  travis yeah throat coat with a little bit of honey  laura are you making a starbucks run  liam we can do that  laura /none/ if youre doing a starbucks run i would love a starbucks please  liam

liam were getting picky no its all right  travis if you dont mind it keeps me from wandering  liam its fine  laura im freaking out right now what is happening  liam you guys all get set up and /none/ after a while liam pops in on his own and hes smiling but he  looks a little tense  sam thats normal  laughter  liam he goes okay so we have a ton of shit to get through we have enough time but  sam did they not budget correctly for this  liam were good we just cant screw around too much not too much so its going to be great  should be great okay all right ill be with you guys in one minute and he heads back out he  goes in you guys /none/ are now vacuumsealed in and theyre talking  laura can they hear us are the mics live can they hear us  taliesin i was going to say its warner brothers

guess well just dive into it so the first page of the script is right there  on the top  laura oh i see what were doing now  travis the one with our name on it right  liam yeah  sam just that one  liam yeah just the one so this is the first weve got like 50 of these to get through this is  us leaving oathbreaker keep right after that huge fight laura between your character right and  the /none/ quartermaster you and the quartermaster fought and now youre leaving in a huff  laura yeah  liam okay so the last thing that happens in that scene i just want to remind you is sam  tantalus gets cheeky with her and sends her off so laura remember that youre coming off of that  line from the very end when you shove him out of the way and walk toward the gate  laura i am so embarrassed i forgot my glasses at the session thats okay ill be able to see  its totally fine yeah i /none/ can see it ill just hold it close  liam okay so is everybody ready to get started  vocal warmup sounds  liam okay allen calls out the take number and says take one and you guys are left into  silence  laura enough the felguard had their chance if were to end this scourge we do it on our own  sam sighs make hay while the sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of plan  travis i say we knock on the vargarths door and feed them their broken promises  taliesin direct /none/ i like it  laura quiet were not alone  travis is that how youre going to do it  laura did i say scourge wrong scourge  liam that was my first point its scourge you said scorge well well do one more do me a  favor this is like a walkandtalk so flatten it out yeah taliesin  taliesin yeah no i  liam flatten it all i think flatten it all out a bit keep it on the move and sam i think your  guy is a little miffed from getting shoved right before in /none/ the cutscene that leads into this so i  want to carry some of that you know  sam shushes bixby okay got it  liam are we cool okay all right well just go right back into one more  travis anything for me  liam no just more of the same just overall everybody can flatten it out a little bit yes  travis was the best here we go again  laura did allen say the im sorry is it on  taliesin were rolling that was the beep  laura i didnt hear the take number /none/  liam im sorry i spaced out this is take two  laura enough the felguard had their chance if were to end this scourge we do it on our own  sam make hay pickup make sighs pickup make hay while the pickup make hay while the  sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of pickup make hay while the sun shines i suppose  and you have some sort of plan  liam liam cuts in on the mic and says its really good guys the whole room the devs  pierce everybody is busting /none/ up laughing behind the glass window behind him you know lets just  get a fresh one sam  sam sorry i was distracted  liam were off to a great start guys great start all right here we go thisll be take three  laura enough the felguard had their chance if were to end this scourge we do it on our own  sam make hay while the sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of plan  travis i say we knock on the vargarths door and feed them their broken promises  taliesin direct /none/ i like it  laura quiet were not alone  liam that was perfect that was and then just as liam says that he turns to the guys  behind him and they go back and forth he takes his finger off youre in silence for a second  taliesin this is going to be ten minutes  sam theyre rewriting something they always rewrite something  taliesin theyre recasting something or rewriting something  travis if youd pay attention to it  laura can you hear us  travis no  sam i could probably do my line a /none/ little better  liam okay it was totally awesome lets just try one more thing where i would say that i do  want it all flattened out but just the very first line really explode at sam  laura until the exclamation point or the whole line  liam through chance i would say just round on him and then you know furrowed brow heading in  laura groans got it  travis and just better overall  laura thank you travis  taliesin more acting  laura thank you taliesin  liam everybodys great lets just do one /none/ more and well have this rumbling what was that cue  pierce what was that  sam feedback or something  liam fuck it all right last take and this is take four  laura burps enough the felguard had their chance if were to end this scourge we do it on  our own  sam slurred make hay while the sun shines i suppose and you have some sort of plan  travis i say we knock on the vargarths door and feed them their broken promises  taliesin direct i like it  laura sarcastically quiet were /none/ not alone  travis did you feel that too  sam we made different choices  liam okay i that was a good option i think probably hold on  travis see you make them fight amongst themselves  liam guys just give me a second  sam whispers take one was fine  laura im serious you should take the collar off of the dog i can hear it  travis you know sometimes you got to give them the really bad laughs  taliesin im having some weird stomach stuff too i dont know if theyre picking that /none/ up  travis take another drink you sounded a little smacky the last take  liam while you guys are all yammering you notice that liam is gesticulating a little bit more its  lasting a while  travis maybe a little agitated  liam i mean youve all worked with liam you know how when he turns to the people behind him  and he talks and then he comes back and gives you a little like just for you you know how he  does that this is the other half of that where hes trying to get /none/ some point across anyway time  is passing  laura and were just sitting here  travis its been a hot second  liam and he turns around just give me one minute were just trying to figure out shit on  our end okay well be right with you  laura okay should we take a  taliesin just do one more louder thats just usually what they want just one more louder  sam you know pierce is fucking taking forever with this tea also  laura oh still no coffee i sent him to starbucks sorry  /none/ sam i dont think he owns a car  laura no they have a starbucks on the lot  taliesin does he have the golf cart  travis yeah i think they have little electric golf carts  laura those things are awesome  liam so laura while everybodys talking you just space out like youre looking at your iphone  for a little bit  laura youre right you know what what was i thinking this is not what would happen  liam but after 30 seconds of that and they have been talking for a long time youre /none/ just spacing  out and you stare over at your water bottle  next of you there on the little standy thing and  you see strangely a little ripple in the water and before you can even decide what that means  everyone feels a little vibration under the ground  laura oh my god was that an earthquake  liam and then the entire room rocks to the side you guys all sway to one side you see everybody  react behind the glass and out of nowhere what can only be described as a pulse or force /none/ almost  like electromagnetic pulse through your actual brain you wonder is this what radiation feels  like electric humming the sensation is like your thoughts turning 360 around in your head and  youre caught in it and then youre out you guys look at each other and the floor has buckled up  and the ceiling has buckled down and worse than that you look to the glass and there is  pandemonium on the other side of it liam is floating two feet in the air alien abduction  style floating in space you cant hear a /none/ thing you cant hear shit you see everyone around him  freaking out and then suddenly his body rips in half  shouting over each other  laura what are you doing  liam not blood and guts but globules of matter almost like beads of mercury floating in the air  between and the two halves hover and both halves of liams face look horrified and frozen in  space and then the next thing that happens is each of those halves you see from that gooey  miasma coming out of their body a shriveled arm and leg /dung/ go poof and they drop and then the  back wall behind everyone that you guys have looked at so many times has darkened and starts  to look wet and purple and expands and bulges almost like the taut flesh of a caterpillar and  suddenly the wall sucks inward sucking noise and youre looking past through really liams two  halves at a dark winding i would almost call it a tunnel except it looks more like intestines  curving in and away and the devs are looking around in horror by the way liam was wearing  /none/ that yellow shirt of his with the lion with the glasses  travis are we in adr6 can i grab the electric guitar  liam this is adr5  travis shit no guitar  liam and thats when you see four more liams in yellow shirts with the lion with the glasses  crawling up the sides of that purple tunnel not like a human but like a little  travis nope  laura this is not okay liam  liam theyre crawling all over the devs theyre yanking them into that tunnel the two liam halves  that were /tavern/ floating there have dropped to the ground and both of them  laura i want to stealth  liam youre an actor  travis i run to the booth door and i bar the door  taliesin im going to grab the mic and help to bar it  travis theres a lock isnt there  liam well the good news is that the floor buckled up and the ceiling buckled down so the  door is jammed in place theres also a splinter up through the glass window  laura can liam see us through the window  liam /none/ everyones really busy right now and the two that dropped to the ground turn towards  pierce and pierce backs up  sam he was back with the starbucks  liam no hed just walked in 30 seconds ago with a full tray of coffee  travis pierce use the coffee scald them  liam he cant hear you he drops it he runs back out the door the two that had been floating there  drop to the ground and scuttle out the door up the stairs out the door after him theyre gone  and the devs are /none/ gone and allen is being dragged bloody and beaten back into that passage  travis are his white new balances covered with gore  liam they were  travis no oh no  liam the lights in the room youre in flicker electric flickering the lights go out  sam we whip out our fucking iphones and we start making phone calls  taliesin im periscoping all this shit  travis do we have any signal  liam you have no signal  groaning  travis what about wifi  liam no wifi there is light coming out of them /none/ and theres light coming out of what you think was  liams mac in the room  sam did we sign our contracts yet  laughter  taliesin this is the most concise direction weve had  travis okay  sam what do we do  travis taliesin go see if anything is out there still  laura you cant send taliesin out there  travis why  laura baby  taliesin if i can get to my car i think i have a kit for this but other than that im not really  sure what to do  /none/ travis that does not surprise me about you one bit  sam wait are there currently liams in the control room  liam no and in fact that intestinal tunnel going back has swelled shut and sealed its  still dripping  taliesin okay is the rail system for the television broken  liam the what system  taliesin well you know the giant tv in adr5 is on a big swinging arm  liam no its still all intact  taliesin so we can break the glass if we just give this thing a big heavy push  laura /none/ can we try to get the door i mean is the door completely  liam you can certainly have at it  sam laughs trademark it  sam and taliesin you can certainly have at it  taliesin new shirt  laura travis try to lift the ceiling up and ill try to pull the door out just push the ceiling  boards up some so i can try to open the door  travis all right i try and push  sam im going to assist  travis  the ceiling boards

laura look how strong you are though youre so strong baby  liam i couldnt give you 18s in everything guys  travis no thats true  liam so what did you want to do  travis were going to try and push the ceiling part of the door up the jamb see if we can  relieve some pressure on the door  laura and then im going to try to pull the door open  travis sams helping me so /none/ were bringing over the chairs to stand on  liam all right well you make a strength check with advantage  travis with advantage ooh baby first roll oh god that was terrible 12  sam with advantage  liam its not budging  laura

heres adr5 you just smashed the glass right here and youve come up the stairs  and as you creep up quiet as you can bixby farts you wait you pause for a second nothing  happens you look its dark out here there is a flicker of light coming from down in /none/ this  direction everyones got cellphone flashlights on okay you swivel over here to the left and  this hallway like tin foil is crumpled in  sam impassable  laura its okay we need to go the other direction anyway  taliesin i say run and duck into the kitchen and see and just run and duck into the kitchen  liam okay well sorry so theres a door here youre passing it there is as you come out the  door you all hear a metallic sound ringing its hard to tell what it is but something is /none/  spilling out of the kitchen like six feet high spilling out of the kitchen  laura we cant see what it is can we put our flashlights on  liam sure its beautiful its goldlooking its coins and other stuff spilling on a  diagonal slant down out of the kitchen into the hallway right in front of that frigging little  sitting area its a pile of stuff  taliesin no  travis what do you mean no the gold  taliesin why would they put it here this is the worst place to put money  sam /dung/ maybe theres a vault down here theres a lot of old vaults down here  liam while you guys are arguing a gigantic red like a gigantic alligators claw i guess  comes down along that slant and rakes in as much of it as it can and pulls gold and as it does so  a little goblet spills out you see a sword spill out on the ground  travis mine  liam theres a mess of stuff in there and maybe a third less gold there now  laura are there any other weapons  travis just /none/ to protect us im going to go get the sword  sam you cant go over there what if that thing grabs you  laura just walk around to the other side we have to get out that hallway anyway  taliesin im going to go through my bag and see if i have anything  laura thats the hallway weve got to go  sam should we create a diversion  liam barks  laura oh jeez just go  travis can i kill the dog with the sword  sam and laura no  taliesin grab the sword /none/ and lets run out  travis im going to go and try and grab the sword and come back to them real fast  liam okay as you do so you see a sword you also see a dagger you also see the edge of a bow  poking out of it you also see a silverishcolored looking stick or rod  travis just grab all of them and run back to them  liam you grab a bunch of stuff make a dexterity check  laura so you dont cut yourself with all the weapons  travis eight  /none/ liam eight you do manage to slice into your hand on something youre holding an armful of sharp  stuff but you come and you dump it out a sword a maniac sword its gigantic a couple daggers  fall to the ground as well you had a bow hanging over your neck and theres a weird silvercolored  rod there that has tentacles etched into it in a spiral down around it  taliesin its a

the tunnel go crunch  taliesin upstairs  sam we run towards the light  liam you run towards the light well this was the light its gone now youre just iphones as  you run past this open door

liam you want to go out there  laura yeah  liam youre going out there taliesin grabs the door deep humming you feel your thoughts  twisting around in your head again you feel that feeling of /none/ you can only imagine highpowered  radiation something  laura oh jeez taliesin get away from the door  liam you cant move nobody can move youre held in place the moment his hand touched the door  deep humming youre standing on the steps and youre looking at the parking lot sort of the door in  your hand is rusted and old and youre looking at the fivestorytall form of a gray green legged  squidlike monstrosity everyone roll a d20  sam for what what are we rolling  travis 15  laura oh no advantage five /none/  taliesin 19  sam eight  liam all of you except for taliesin is frozen in terror at the mindnumbing presence of what can  only be a harbinger of the end of the world you think it is massive it could crush you if it  sneezed on you  taliesin has it noticed us  liam yes it has  taliesin im going to gently start pulling people back towards the door  liam its head brays at the sky and a groan comes out of it like the sound of a whale magnified for  10000 /none/ miles if anyone is still alive in calabasas they are hearing an allterrifying  groan as it looks down at you the pulse in your head goes throbs the advil is not working and  you see it flex five stories this thing is coming out of what used to be olive avenue there is a  massive chasm outside of the warner brothers lot and this thing looks as if it were a chinese  dragon it looks like it is continuing down to that crevice and coming up to here and it is  looking at you and /none/ flexing and you see all over its body little ridges little nubs start to  bulge and protrude almost like little blackheads pushing out and then deep humming you all feel  that same pulse moving through your head as youre frozen in place and taliesin just agog one of  them goes explosion fires out like a little missile and starts to fall and the beast is gone  and youre looking at a different sight the building that it had crushed is there again but  covered in vegetation everything is covered in centuries of vegetation there is /none/ a massive pond  here in the parking lot and you watch dumbstruck the fear releasing as a thing  splashing splashes into the pond you look out to the left at the gate and there is still a  giant chasm where olive used to be the nearest land you can see is by the gas station or what  was the gas station three blocks away the tower you can see one leg sticking up out of the  foliage you are in dense  laura are we still frozen in fear  liam its just released and /none/ theres a thing in water going slithering  laura i dont think we should try to go outside any more guys  travis i

see is green the only thing you see that  isnt green right now is part of the door next to you and part of the water tower one of its legs  is sticking up like a bony finger  laura i wonder if we could climb the water tower legs to see around  /none/ sam at summer camp  travis you did archery at summer camp  sam yeah  travis how many arrows do you have  sam how many arrows do i have  liam do

tentacles in it when you  hold it this arm that black aura grows larger than in the other hand  laura ugh taliesin you have a tentacle hand  taliesin wait im going to try something im /none/ going to try to fire something with the not  tentacle hand at the dead creature  sam its dead we know this right  taliesin no hes not moving that doesnt mean dead im going to try  liam yeah black tentacles

sam oh shit what is that move  laura why didnt you do /none/ that earlier  taliesin because it was moving earlier this is weird  travis is this helping your headache at all  liam your headache is a

our cars too  travis 14  laura oh i drove here separately 20  liam 20  taliesin eight  liam you guys look through the vegetation you take 15 minutes to dig through here and theres  other sections where theres more fetid water and theres bugs that are biting and it smells like  ass in a lot of places you do find a car the wheels are pudding the windows are gone it is  smashed all to hell and theres vines and leaves and ivy /town/ growing in it and around it  sam is it a blue prius  taliesin is it a blue scion or the remnants of a blue scion  liam everything is brown underneath plant life you got up to the point where everybody parks when  you are visiting for vo and youre at the base and you can see sticking out the contours of the  water tower are there but its totally covered over you can see the street that goes past that  that leads into the pretend town and the only reason you know it is /none/ because youve been here  so many times you recognize the contours of this canyon swooping around but you do see one piece  of what looks like a stoop in a brooklyn building nonsensically out of this tropical setting  laura can we climb it  sam weve got to go find ashley  travis lets take a look from a vantage point the towers right here  sam but the towers only one leg we cant climb one leg of a tower  taliesin no its the fake brooklyn building  liam what do you want to climb /town/  laura whatevers sturdy  liam i dont know whats sturdy  laura what looks the sturdiest  sam you can certainly have a go was that it  liam you can certainly have at it fake town is like a canyon covered in green the tower is a  hump there are plenty of vines on it you could give it a try try and climb up a vine  laura im pretty good at climbing  liam its less scary than the absolute straight up  laura yeah im going to try to climb the thing  liam /none/ all right make an athletics check  travis well keep watch on the ground  laura i like that i really put my backpack on i feel like were on a mission right now oh no  what is it athletics oh no its a seven  liam okay its really tough  laura shouts travis push my butt so i can get up higher  travis why dont i climb up  laura because its going to break youre too big  sam you are pretty big  liam part of the problem is that the vines are breaking /town/ away in your hand so you cant get a  firm grip on it  laura see  travis it looks a little dangerous i dont know if you should go up there  taliesin wait maybe if we try to cut through the vines and get into the doors they have those  awful little stairs inside these buildings anyway we could maybe just climb up inside  travis use the sword on the door  taliesin on the vines to get to the door  travis yeah i bushwhack them  liam on the side of fake town /none/ you mean is everybody going to follow make a survival check  travis all right 12  liam theres a fucking door under there  travis theres a door under there  liam its coming away  laura open it  sam im going to tell bixby hey bixby hey buddy can you watch our back and if anything  comes bark  liam panting  sam i think he understood me just stay stay and watch  travis can i try the door  liam oh yeah it pushes in in fact it disintegrates as you push through  /none/ travis okay there are termites  liam youre in its really mushy theres much less vegetation in here although it has crept its  way in here and you do see wooden stairs obviously not a brooklyn building because it was  all fake when they made this whenever they made it but there is wooden stairs going up want to  go up  travis do we go up  taliesin you go up youre light we stay down here  laura okay  sam im not going to let her go up there by herself  laura no /none/ its okay im small ill be quiet im gonna try to be as quiet as possible and climb the  stairs  liam okay make a stealth check  sam take your phone and text us  laura our phones dont work stupid  sam well maybe text still works  taliesin text doesnt work here  laura whispers what is that what does that add to 22  liam okay now make an acrobatics check  laura oh come on 15  sam and now an animal handling check  laughter  liam you make your way in you /none/ guys cant hear her after she rounds a corner and you see as you  gently put your toes down in different places by the way your phone is dead  laura oh no it already died  travis thats what you get if you look at twitter your whole session  laughter  liam you gingerly place your feet down and youre seeing parts where the wood gives way but  youre finding a few places that are firm its a little jittery but you get up to the second floor  of this fake building there is a /none/ window you can see it is entirely dusted over on the other side  and you can see all this leaves and stuff on the other side  laura can i push through the leaves  liam youve got to open the window  laura i open the window  liam okay make a strength check  laura come on 14  liam yeah slides right up part of it comes off in your hands as mush and pudding you throw it  down there is a veil of plants you spend a minute pulling it aside youre looking down /none/  around you went up to the bend and on the corner youre now looking down to where you once knew  outdoor tables and the bathrooms and the commissary the cafeteria you can kind of make  out just because of your memory you know the distance  laura do i see the starbucks  liam no you see trees  laura do i see anything moving  liam you see a seam in the sky go ripping like a wound above yellow viscous fluid comes  and pours and pours and keeps pouring out of the sky and /none/ splashes down into this canyon and  starts spreading in both directions towards where the commissary used to be and towards where the  tower was it doesnt look like water it doesnt look like snot its somewhere inbetween like  vegemite  travis were going up  sam and taliesin we cant see  taliesin we dont know this is happening yet  liam the rift goes tearing and its gone its just blue sky  laura guys i run down can i go back down theres ooze coming out of the sky and filling  up like yellow /none/ gunk filling up out of the sky  sam where  laura the sky opened up and then this stuff fell out  sam and what do you want us to do  laura i dont know  taliesin im going to look outside  laura i didnt see anything moving is it coming towards us  liam are you looking out the door now  taliesin im looking out the door now  liam there is a frigging foot deep of yellow pus just everywhere  sam bixby bixby come  liam he does come and he is coated /none/  sam im sorry boy  travis hows he doing  liam hes losing his hair hes balding a bit  laura i get some kleenex out of my purse and i try to get it off of him  liam you wipe it away hair comes away as you wipe  taliesin nair its made of nair  sam yeah so maybe we go up can we go across the rooftops did you see  taliesin thats a terrible idea  sam did you see a way a path  liam you may indubitably give it your best effort /tavern/  laura i lead them up the stair path that i found  liam okay yeah youre able to do that everyone is able to follow you show them where not to  step  laura dont step here dont step in that spot  travis i step there anyway  liam travis roll a d20  travis laughs nine  liam youre okay not a high bar to cross just wanted you to sweat because its fun you make it  up you find all of these buildings are connected on the inside because it was all bullshit it /town/ was  all magic  sam so we can just walk across the rooftops  liam itll take some doing but probably  laura lets do that  sam towards the cafeteria  laura towards the commissary  sam wait from our vantage point does it look like warner brothers studios is the epicenter of  this or can we see parts of burbank and television city  liam you look out you dont see buildings  sam but does it seem to be originating from here is it just everywhere  liam as far as you can see you /none/ see green as far as you can see  travis its the last of us dude its all over i think we should eat taliesin and move on  taliesin i think if its the last of us we need ashley johnson and then we can make a decision  travis thats right we heard her voice say in the cafeteria  taliesin this is not just about me not wanting to submit to cannibalism  travis lets use the building to get towards the cafeteria  laura thanks good idea travis  sam laughs god he really is dumb /none/  taliesin you should go first  sam all right ill start going across the rooftops or whatever  liam wheres bixby by the way  sam im holding him  travis is he melting yet  laura i wiped all the stuff off of him  liam as best you can tell hes halfbald hes got patches of hair patches of not  travis whispering why are we carrying the dog  sam i

the window and look out the vines  liam theres another little canyon of plant life and you do actually see somehow one corner of a  metal table is managing to poke through all this shit but you see a bird fluttering sound land  and sway on a vine fluttering sound fly off again  laura whispering well birds are alive still so its not all weird creatures  taliesin it was a normallooking bird  liam

close are we at this point  liam super close youre just in the building one or two doors down  sam weve got to climb down and do we have to traverse ooze to get to it  liam i dont know got to get out there  travis is there anything linking the rooftops of the two buildings any old power lines or power  poles that may have fallen over  taliesin this is /none/ not tomb raider  liam you could make an investigation check i suppose  sam theres vines travis  taliesin that looks like a very high number  travis 20  liam 20 you look all around there doesnt seem to be any trap doors or stairs it seems  like this is as high as you go in this fake building  travis it seems like this is as high as we go  laura so maybe we should just get down to the ground  sam okay but before we go laura grab that dagger of yours why /none/ dont you cut off that vine  that way well have at least a rope we can use for something  laura good fucking call sam i cut some vine off and i wrap it up like a little whip

you cant think youre not inside anymore you look around  you wasteland total wasteland the remains of a few buildings but not much scorched earth  everything is ash and desolation san fernando stretches for miles to the hills to the north a  vast valley of /none/ scorched earth and the odd fragment of fallen civilization jutting up a few stories at  best and behind you the hills bordering what probably once was hollywood stand barren grim  the only thing that dominates the landscape is the tower gleaming almost like new like it were  built in 1927 the warner brothers water tower standing above the waste rifts in the sky above  it tear open for a moment ripping vanish as quickly as they come every six or seven seconds  lightning storm around it  and thats when you realize it youve been /none/ here before or maybe not here somewhere like here  together you four have adventured together before and youll do it again youve lived a  thousand lives before this together youll

tower  liam as you get closer to it you /none/ do see something you see patches of yellow all along the  legs of the tower  laura oh is it that goop sky goop  liam you see liams glued geigerlike all over the legs of the tower some sort of mucuslike  membrane over them holding them in place theyre also not liams about 511 that you remember  these are about four feet  sam maybe theyre not fully formed yet maybe this is where theyre born  liam electricity courses through the metal of the tower into them electricity sounds back out  again all through /none/ the legs the whole thing is charged  sam wait was liam ever liam  travis we need some of the happy slime from ghostbusters ii  liam and above now that youre closer you couldnt see it before in the sky circling the peak of the tower  you see a gaunt corpselike steed a horse of the apocalypse leaving a trail of fire behind it as  it circles the tower on it rides a shriveled corpse with red hair straggling behind it and as you  draw even closer it hits you there is no mistaking that /none/ thin towering frame that is  fucking conan obrien  laughter  liam i mean he films right on the lot  sam its dead conan obrien  liam he is moving  laura riding the horse  liam all thats left on the bottom is a skeletal jaw the flesh stops here but that signature  pompadour is a little ragged but its still there  travis hes like 65 this

this  liam lets go through the hashtag and find some questions thanks that was a lot of fun for me to do  laura would you consider taking  travis  critical role on an international tour baby steps  sam lets see how this live show goes  laura question travis are you really  sam  getting double scale for this  travis totally  liam someones asking i mean we get it all the time i guess we can put it to rest how old our  characters /none/ are  laura in this game  taliesin according to imdb  travis i dont think grog knows  liam that makes sense  laura oh man thats so sad  travis why would i count those things  laura i dont know you cant count past six anyway  travis no i just know once a year people give me sweet things and cake  laura thats so sweet  travis get your hand off me  laura were what 27  liam 27 i think is what we said at one point it could be 28 at this /none/ point  taliesin early 20s i dont like to pin it down early 20s  travis sam what about you  sam im a little older than that  taliesin with time change or without because youve also got the crazy time shit  sam apparently they undid that i never asked for it to be undone  laura are you in your 40s  sam i look like i am around your guys age  laura oh really do gnomes age differently  sam they do age differently they are on a slower scale than you guys  laura /none/ we are too  sam you guys are halfelves so youre only barely different  laura we live around to 150 dont we  sam so if youre 27 years old that means that you guys are teenagers  taliesin its the medieval era you die before 40 really you guys are going to live forever  sam yeah but if youre 27yearold halfelves do you look like youre 18yearolds  laura we probably look around 20  travis next question  liam someone asked how much not the cthulhu portion of the game but how much the early part /none/  of the game was true to life  laura it was exaggerated  sam we are working on that game  liam we were talking about a real place that we work at a lot and people we see and some of that  was realistic  laura pierce is real emmas real  sam emma is real warner brothers games is a game place where we record much  taliesin they really have a giant television on a swinging arm  laura all of the layout of the booths is exactly right there is really gold coming out /none/ of the  kitchen all the time  taliesin makes it really hard to get tea  sam pierce is awesome  laura and he started playing dnd because of critical role  travis thats true you can find him at emerald knights  laura yeah thats right  taliesin he needs fanart  sam if you could play as another character of vox machina body switch for a day who would it be  travis scanlan  laura i know right  liam that would be the hard one i keep thinking it would be fun for a oneoff /none/ magically have  laura the abilities  liam no to be vax but with one of your personalities in me so i would have to be you in  me and start talking like this the whole time you know  taliesin well no because wed be playing each other then  liam but if i were vaxs body with percy inside id have to start talking the way you do  taliesin yeah that would be fun i would like to be grog that would be fun  sam i think i would if i could switch characters well /none/ grog is pretty fun man its a  pretty fun character and he does big damages and stuff yeah i think grog its fun to be dumb  travis it is  liam i know the one i would not want to do is scanlan because i dont think i could pull it off  laura i know youre so quick thats too hard  sam i have a team of writers  laughter  sam i hired a team of writers  laura its really fun to watch but i would feel so intimidated trying to play  sam /none/ that is so flattering  travis gasps any plans to come to nashville tennessee i work for the titans and could  possibly do something cool for you guys if the cowboys are playing the titans maybe we will  sam could possibly do something cool for you guys mean give travis a starting lineup on the  titans for one game maybe preseason game  travis ill take it  sam you played some ball  travis i did i played some college ball  sam if you were given the shot just one shot you get one play /none/ what position are you going to  play defenseoffense  travis tight end a button a bootleg to the left  sam so youre blocking  travis no im catching the ball  taliesin we dont actually know how the game is played  liam people are curious what class marisha was for her brief cameo she was a monk i asked  everyone what they thought they would be thats not true i didnt ask ashley but i knew what i  wanted to do for the story marisha texted me somewhere in the middle of the game because /none/ i told  matt and marisha about all of this i was too flummoxed to answer but she said if you dont  have me say dope somewhere in there  taliesin i think shes got it tattooed  on her arms  liam sorry marisha it all went by so quick  travis question will vax and gilmore ever end up together  liam i dont know  laura who knows where life will take you guys  liam i will say that vax is headoverheels completely in love with keyleth so if you guys  want him to /none/ go get it on with gilmore when he is seriously in love with another person okay  laura i think some people would be okay with that  liam i do too  laura travis on a scale of one to 22 how much do you oh it went away as i was reading it  sam it said how much do the giants washingtons team and the eagles suck i refuse  to say the name of washingtons team  travis yeah pretty bad  sam question liam what was your inspiration for this story  liam well listen /none/ i said literally the day before i announced that i was going to do this  that i didnt want to do this and the next day i totally flipflopped because i was too busy with  work i knew that i wanted to do something eventually i just figured it would be six or  seven months from now but then i had all this time open up to work on something and the idea popped  into my head i always knew i would want to do something totally different from what matt does  because he does /none/ it better than anybody  taliesin yeah hes intimidating  liam i dont want go anywhere near high fantasy because he does it so perfectly so i thought i  would go in the opposite direction and try to make my friends  travis you killed it man it was awesome  taliesin you did it was amazing  liam eventually as i thought it all out i just started thinking what would the artists like to  draw thats what it was like in the back  end of designing  travis taliesin what kind of things do you /none/ have in your car for this sort of scenario  taliesin legitimately right now in my car i have a quiver of arrows i do still left over from the  photo shoot i havent returned them to my friend ashley  laura shit taliesin that was a while ago  taliesin yeah i havent cleaned out my car so i have that i have my laptop and all my work stuff  and phone chargers ive got a black velvet frock coat large leather boots im not kidding about  any of this a hardcover copy of the wicked /none/  the divine thank you for putting that on my character  sheet and some nail wraps thank you for putting that on my character sheet although not the ones i  used in the game because the ones i would have used in the game would have been the  limited edition hamilton federalist papers  laura i want those so bad  travis there was a question that said how much do you all love hamilton right now were all  obsessed  sam have you seen it yet  laura no were going to go yeah were /none/ going to go visit ashley and go see  taliesin i have outtakes from recording today of caitlin glass singing whole chunks of it  travis and laura its a problem  taliesin its such a problem  laura which class would you have been liam had you been playing  travis oh good question  liam i dont know probably still a rogue i think thats what i would lean towards  laura we would have been twinsie rogues again  liam hide and fucking stab when no ones looking and then just hide and hide and hide  /none/ taliesin weirdly i would have thrown out wizard im surprised i would have pegged wizard  liam yeah i like wizards too  travis sam how much time do you spend on your goblet  sam how much time do i spend on my goblet i spend one minute before the episode gluing  something to the bottom and its whatever i can find lying around that day  travis do you guys jump on the shipping bandwagon or is it completely weird for you we just watch  we just watch and admire  laura watch the shipping  /none/ taliesin its like coming across coyotes in the wild im so happy to see it and i dont want to  call attention to it either its awesome  laura i favorite a lot of drawings because i love looking at art of it  travis we are not seeing hamilton before lin leaves  laura no were not  travis who is more useful bixby or trinket  sam giggles not a fair question neither are useful they are just energy sucks  laura we did have a conversation out during the break about how hard it is to /none/ have an animal  companion  sam i have a newfound respect for laura having just played a beastmaster ranger its tough to  have this stupid animal around all the time that you have to deal with who cant really do anything  and could die at any minute  laura who is really cute and you want to protect it but you want to take advantage of the fact  that you have it  sam i know but its hard to do that  laura i know  sam i have a newfound respect for you i /none/ still dont like trinket  laura at least you could pick up bixby like back in the day when we had to walk around with  trinket  taliesin but now youve got the pokeball though the pokeballs great  travis critical role the musicals still a ways off its still under development its following  the linmanuel thing its a sevenyear timeline  laura travis you are my favorite  travis started my own goliath barbarian youre welcome  sam question who does pike like  laura like we can answer that  sam we dont know  laura /none/ i know  sam you know  laura i know  sam how do you know because ashley told you or because pike told you  laura because ashley told me  liam well i was in that conversation too  laura yeah but i knew before  taliesin shes been bragging that shes known for a while now too and she just lords it over us  laura there was a question that i talked over wasnt there  travis oh it said if you guys get the airship who would be the captain and what positions would  /none/ you man  sam on the airship youre the captain  taliesin i want to be teddy ruxpin so you can be the little caterpillar dude who follows him  around all the time  sam and laura what  taliesin do you not know your tiddy teddy ruxpin motherfuckers  laura your titty your titty ruxpin  sam titty ruxpin is the worst porn by the way  taliesin you just dont like it because of bears  sam i would be cabin boy wait is that what we established youre cabin boy or im cabin boy  im /none/ cabin boy and youre the captain  taliesin im first mate and then we all take turns being the captain  liam somebody asked if vax knew that gilmore wasnt gilmore when he stabbed him and i did  think that it was somebody else before because his voice dropped and he became very ungilmorelike i  didnt immediately think rakshasa i just didnt think it was gilmore  laura i thought it was a demon  taliesin matt does a thing with his voice and he did that thing that night someone asked will you  ever use diplomacy /none/ again yeah its just really complicated because in order to use it i have to  get hit by lightning and inevitably thats going to happen and thats a wonderful counter to being  hit by lightning at the moment until i can sit down and do something to it  sam someone wants to know travis what class were you in the game we just played  travis i was a fighter not a paladin or a barbarian but a fighter  laura and sam fighter  laura oh i saw the question what level were we when we /tavern/ all started the game we were all level  one when we started  travis and we lived we lived  laura matt was very kind to us when we first started playing  taliesin we fought a lot of bandits if i recall there were a lot of bandits  laura people springing when we were trying to help people jumping out of wagons  taliesin a lot of bar fights and people threatening us with mugs  laura question does grog have any love interests  travis he does  laura gasps he does  travis yeah it /none/ all comes from a beer mug or one of his appendages  taliesin theres a whorehouse in westruun  travis grogs got too much love to single it out for one person  taliesin yeah no thats cool  liam someone asked if what they saw this is related to the earlier question if what they saw  was the average day in a voice actor i mean we hammed it up but sure sessions a free morning  working out and then going to a session or two sessions sam directing and rushing over  somewhere  laura sam /none/ not having any time ever  travis liam would you hire me as a voice actor  liam you could be a serial killer i dont know  travis no that was a question from the chat  liam oh i know that i know it was yeah if you  wind up in front of me and audition the truth is  when i direct i dont do much casting i do a little bit i do some suggesting but most of the  casting comes from elsewhere and i direct who shows up in front of me  /none/ travis laura and taliesin pick up  sam i do not say pick up in my real life  taliesin we were talking about that  laura if anybody said that i dont know if id be able to handle it in a session if they did what  you did  sam pick up  laura pick up im sorry pick up pick up i would die  liam ive heard that not 90 times in a row but ive heard someone say pick up  travis laura do you think stealing the broom was enough to change alignments /none/  laura no  taliesin its a broom people  laura its a broom damn it and heres the thing heres my thing about the alignment i was  neutral good stealing a lowly little broom and im going to say that i did not realize because  ive never played this game outside of our game that if you stole something from another player  it was a bad thing  sam i didnt know stealing was bad  laura no but i just thought it was funny some people say its a nono to steal from other  /none/ players i didnt know that because he was coming on and it was funny and it was a fun thing  taliesin weve all stolen shit from chris hardwick at this point whats the big fucking deal  liam plus were coming at this as actors doing an improv show almost anything is game  laura exactly so i just thought it was funny but vex for the most part has very good  intentions for everything that she does so if anything i should have dropped to just neutral  or is there such a thing as chaotic good /none/  taliesin yeah im chaotic good  laura i feel like thats what i should have been but straightup chaotic neutral i feel like was  dropped two levels of alignment which i think was wrong i have talked to matt about it afterward  because i feel like for where she is in her head for her to be that alignment im a little worked  up about it  travis liam did it go better than you expected were you nervous dming for your friends and would  you be open to doing it again  liam yeah /none/ i would do it again i dont want to do it all the time because its a lot of work  and with two kids and my work schedule im pretty crazed  taliesin i may take one youve made me feel like i could maybe do it  liam i will say i was very anxious about it in the leadup but five minutes into it i was having  a blast i didnt care wasnt worried about what i was going to say beforehand i was like im  going to fuck it up am i going to /none/ say that at the right time totally didnt matter didnt care  it was just fun  laura you were great liam  liam thanks man  travis we are totally looking forward to the live show by the way anybody that can join us will

hipster rakshasa shirt comes from threadlesscom a bunch of people asked  taliesin no if i do a game its probably and i dont want to confirm it tabletop vampire was a big  thing when i was a teenager i really /none/ like tabletop vampire  liam is it a complicated system  taliesin its very simple  travis this is a good question for a bunch of nerds favorite musical besides hamilton  laura and taliesin ever  sam les mis but theres other ones that are good too  taliesin i really like the reefer madness musical from a few years ago it was really funny  travis my first love was phantom yeah it

games decrease or  increase your enjoyment of playing them sam this is a question for you  /none/ sam its similar to if you watch a lot of porn does that desensitize you to  travis or if you do a lot of porn would you watch it when youre getting off  sam i think the answers yes  liam someone has asked was the liam in the recording studio the real liam or was there a  liam mastermind somewhere i would say in my imagination it was the real liam  laura and you really got pulled apart  liam and i got pulled apart and set off a chain of liam duplication  sam /none/ why did conan choose you  liam that i cant answer  sam you can answer that  laura when we were killing little baby liams was your brain in them  liam a fragment yeah  laura oh no that makes me feel so sad  taliesin just sleep  travis to answer your question we do love playing the video games  taliesin yeah you do start to recognize voices and listen for things you get a little bit of the  tech brain but other than that its really fun its one of the reasons im enjoying /none/ overwatch is  that i barely recognize anyone which both makes me sad and happy  travis meet and greet will be for vip tickets at the live thing i

a movie theater with stadium seating were  going to have a stage on the floor while we project it on the movie screen itll be great  laura i like that its stadium seating  sam and /none/ if it doesnt go well they can put civil war up and everyone gets a nice show  travis well narrate it  laura i like that its a small theater because im afraid i would get so nervous if there was a  lot of people  travis what is the scariest moment for you so far in the critical role campaign  laura scariest moment  sam matt does some scares in every episode  travis i would say i didnt want to die by kevdaks hand i thought that was going to happen  i would almost /none/ be okay with dying at any other moment i just didnt want to die at that point  taliesin that was the most scared the group has ever been  laura going into the kevdak fight i think we realized too late  sam we should not have done that  taliesin we bit off way more than we could chew  travis it was great for the story  taliesin it was great  sam there was a question shit ive already forgotten it  liam i think the most recent was the worst for me being up there /none/ with the rakshasa it felt like  getting hit by a bus it felt like i was out of my control shit just creamed me i felt like matt  totally fucking hoodwinked me and it emotionally fucked me up for a few days  laura plus and then when we started i was like okay weve got to get to liam weve just got to get to  liam and then he throws those assassins in i was not expecting that  sam yeah and i got to liam and he jumped off the fucking ledge out of range /dung/ of all of my spells and  any help i could have given  liam setting you up for that amazing moment and jumping out  laura if you would have rolled a one  taliesin that would have been very sad  travis will we dress as our characters at the live show  laura at the live show oh man  travis we only wear those outfits on the weekends when we have parties with each other  taliesin i wear mine in the hot tub just my jacket  travis lets take a couple more weve got /none/ a couple more minutes  sam there was one question earlier that said laura and travis how did it feel rping as a couple  tonight  laura i know because we dont ever have any kind of romantic stuff  travis you put our life at great risk often i had to chase after you and save you like i do  every day it was okay  laura yeah felt pretty normal  travis yeah i was proud that was good yeah  liam i was super curious to see what you guys would do once you realized /none/ you were playing as  yourselves at the same fucking places you go everyday  travis that was good you mapped out that studio perfectly  taliesin it was amazing  laura it was so weird to be at the studio and know the location and actually be able to  visualize what youre talking about it was so weird  taliesin down to the fruit on the fruit plate  laura yeah and the brownies  taliesin oh yeah the brownies  travis do you ever feel like mercer is picking on you  laura taliesin and sam no /none/  sam he spreads it out he attacks everybody evenly  liam hes cold like the universe its fine  laura yeah i never feel angry ever like when we joke and were like fuck you matt theres  never any real anger towards him at all its a joint game and it always feels like hes trying to  help us  taliesin even between us we all walk away from the table during breaks going gasps no matter  what the fuck was going on  travis sam your old les mis audition got posted on the internet /dung/ recently is there any other old  work that you would like to see come to light  sam i have a lot of great nuggets from the past  taliesin oh yeah we all have a little bit of interesting youtube ephemera  sam but you and me have some we had done some screen acting as children

whole cult  watching me drink a coke  laura thats awesome is that on youtube  taliesin somewhere i dont know  travis hot cheeto  sam yep hot cheetos up there sure  liam somebody asked if we die what are we going to reroll as that also reminds me of when are  these two characters going to /none/ get together or when are you doing to this and at least my answer  is never going to tell you because i feel like thats going up to jk rowling when you havent  read anything and saying what happens at the end of the final book were not going to tell you  anything that hasnt happened in the future because we want it to unfold in front of you  laura plus we dont necessarily know  sam that is true we dont know i had no idea i had a daughter i had no idea that /none/ changes all  kinds of things for my guy  liam you can keep sending those tweets but its ultimately going to go down the toilet  sam i just dumped pike  laura you dumped pike  sam i dumped pike  travis you broke it off man i was shocked  sam who knew that was going to happen she was pretty broken up over it  taliesin girls are pretty in the feywild im just saying that shits going to go down  travis lets take two or three more and well wrap it up  liam /none/ hey how to get into voice acting take some acting classes go to where the work is boom  done next  sam new york comic con are we going back to new york comic con we went last year  travis the live game will be streamed and if the first live show goes really well then maybe we  will make it to other cities for live shows but its super early on  taliesin i know its too much  travis vip is sold out  laura it went so fast now its going so fast  /none/ sam lets start combining them do you guys watch the live show tpk character  liam sams commercial pizza hut question  laura who would win in a fight stinky jules or percy and i am pretty damn sure percy would win  taliesin percys a vicious son of a bitch  laura stinky jules is a vicious son of a bitch all right regular voice i do think that her  level is way lower but she was pretty fucking cool  taliesin i saw about half an hour of it i enjoyed it  travis i will never /none/ give my allegiance to the green bay packers  sam if you could have one thing answered about the current campaign from matt mercer what would  it be what are you dying to know that he hasnt told us yet  travis do the titanstone knuckles level up any higher than they already are  taliesin i dont want to know  laura discover it as were playing it  taliesin maybe its a thing about working as an actor that you dont feel that drive to know any more  sam i feel that drive to know i /none/ want to know anything  travis i keep seeing gencon well just say stay tuned  taliesin working on it  laura were working on it  taliesin how much is planned and how much is improved we never have conversations with matt  about what were going to do unless were gonna do something that he needs to know about  sam has matt ever had to crash with one of you guys because marisha got mad at him after a game  liam ive seen that a thousand times on the internet  laura there was a point /none/ when we were all talking about what we were going to do in the kevdak  fight where we were like can we technically do this and marisha was like hold on and she got  up and walked in the other room and then came back we were on facetime with each other she was  like matt says you technically cant do that  taliesin no other than using the shower a couple times when the water wasnt functioning thats  pretty much  travis i keep seeing this one i dont always play a warrior type in /none/ video games i get to play  various other things we all get to stretch every once in a while  laura that was a total joke travis plays all sorts of types  travis yeah was there a joke earlier did somebody joke  laura when he was joking about how  sam am i a joke to you  travis am i a joke right now  taliesin yeah no were all rangey  laura last question it better be a good one you guys why hasnt scanlans daughter smelled the  poo note and taken it out /none/  sam that is not a good question to end on  laura who knows she mightve  travis whats it like living with a dragon dangerous keep her fed and let her sleep  laura who asked that question  travis do you have any character regrets you wish you could do over thats a good one yeah  thatll be the last one  sam man so many  travis there have been a couple yeah  sam trying to bone my daughter  laura yeah that one was pretty bad  sam thats a good one  /none/ taliesin individual regrets percy doesnt believe in them he just believes in good life  lessons other than the regret of his existence hes pretty down its like once youve fucked up  that hard everything else is just whatever  travis as long as youre still alive theres no looming regrets but there have been after the  immediate game moments where youre like oh if id just done this instead i was thinking of it and i  pussed out  taliesin i loved our fight and im sad it never got to see its inevitable conclusion the /none/  conversation we had in the craft room afterward was possibly the most satisfying  travis we jumped into a big hug afterwards  taliesin do you remember you were like okay what would have happened if i had put my hand in  the shadow you were like what would have happened  laura you would have realized it was all an illusion  taliesin had the skull in your hand  laura i think my biggest regret is that i couldnt bring vax out of his sadness that he was  feeling as a sister i wasnt able /none/ to i couldnt bring him out like no raven queen could  that made me sad  liam im not sure if thats a regret but that moment a lot of shit and talk from the fans and a  lot of what i thought about swirling around that moment with the raven queen that was a huge deal  for me in the game because what i thought was doing in that split second was bowing out as vax  so that vex could continue thats what i was doing i wasnt angling for the armor i wasnt trying /none/ to  get a cool story i was like what ive always said is that vax dies for vex and im going to die now  and laura will get to keep playing this character and ill come back as a fillintheblank and  fucking mercer spins everything all over the place and it wasnt what i wanted and vax did want to  follow sarenrae and he was in love and becoming the right hand man of the fucking cryptkeeper made  it problematic for all of that so the first week or two after that i was like /none/ sad sigh why maybe  you should have just killed me frustrated sigh it took like ten episodes to go through empire  strikes back to maybe poke my head up slightly at the very end of that but it was a huge fucking  downturn  laura poke your head up out of a pool of blood  taliesin im so excited for it its my favorite thing going on right now  travis i wish i had smashed that skull  taliesin i know  travis last bonus question pirates or ninjas  sam ninjas  taliesin pirates /none/  laura pirates  liam ninjas  travis ninjas take it three to two all right were done liam you are our temporary dm for the night  sam can you close out the night with your patented phrase  liam is it the day before friday yet  travis bye guys see you next week
