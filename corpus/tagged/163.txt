travis do we see anything behind the chess pieces or the other side of the board across from where we are  laura make an investigation check or a perception check rather  travis perception check that is a 17  laura you can see /none/ there seems you saw something pull back when you landed  travis on the other side of the board  laura on the other side of the board hiding behind the pillar over

play carefully im out here by myself  sam dont worry youll definitely live because pawns always do  laura its his turn now /none/ and its going to move to there the knight moves forward the pawn

starting position  laura its you guys turn  travis yeah okay whos good at chess  liam ill go i will go two spaces forward and one to the right  sam can we move our other pieces that arent us /none/  travis yeah you can tell the pawns to move  laura yeah you can  taliesin we just have the ability to actually kill the other pieces if we so wanted to  laura this pawns going to move forward two spaces  sam oi you there in front of me pawn why dont you move ahead one space  laura as this happens suddenly three spiders come out of the darkness one comes out from right  here and theyre walking towards the board  liam and brian theyre so sparkly  laura i know arent they  /none/ brian theyre bedazzled spiders  laura this one comes out from this pillar over here and this spider drops down from

oh god were playing chess this could take an hour  laura this pawn moves forward at the same time that this spider  travis oh fuck  laura rolls up and starts walking towards allison  brian i dont like that  taliesin ah ive got an idea second pawn ahead two spaces not that one that one  laura it cant move that far  sam yeah it can on the first move it can move two squares  laura no i know but the spider  taliesin is it going to get into combat with the /none/ spider  laura no the pawn just moves back theres already somebody occupying that space  sam do the one space then  laura you could do that  taliesin one space then  laura all right  travis im at the top of the initiative right  brian yes 16  travis okay yeah fuck it im going to cast no i should save it right who knows  laura do whatever you want  travis im going to cast tidal wave at this spider  laura do it  sam quite the chess move  travis 120 feet /none/ 30 foot long 10 feet wide so maybe i can take a chess piece with me  brian laura if he succeeds just bring out the dustoff can  laura oh my god  travis youve got to make a dexterity saving throw of 15  laura okay oh no i do not succeed the spider does not succeed against the tidal wave  travis 4d8s so thats counting  sam youre not just focusing on the spider are you  travis no 17 wow that was a good roll 23 that was like fives or sixes or something  /none/ taliesin what does that hit exactly the tidal wave  travis it hits 23 points and knocks prone anything that it hits its 30 feet long ten feet  wide so ten feet wide and ten feet tall so lets say i did it this way  laura so you took out the rook and the pawn  travis yes  laura okay hold on let me roll for them  travis if they can survive 23 points of damage  laura okay  sam is it total damage  travis yeah 23 total  laura neither of them save /none/ on their dex either okay  travis so these are knocked prone  laura yeah  travis and laura goosh  laura that one is knocked prone as well okay 23 to each of those  travis 23 to all three  sam total right no  travis 23 each  sam each wow  brian nice work mate  laura okay  taliesin where did you say youre from  brian leeds  taliesin that explains a lot  brian north leeds shit were going to be in the uk tomorrow  laura did you want to try to /none/ move anybody on your side of the board  travis we did we moved the pawn right that was our  laura oh thats right they havent moved yet no they did  travis now its their turn in initiative or  laura oh god okay okay okay  brian did you roll for every single chess piece too laura  laura i did not because these two knocked over are out of the fight  travis nice  laura they cant get back up all right weve got the spiders turns this spider is going to  come up /none/ here and attack andy  taliesin all right  laura theyre going to make a bite attack against you  taliesin fine  laura oh that is 15 to hit  taliesin oh yeah that hits  laura okay thats 2d8 damage whoa adding 15 points of piercing damage against you now you  need to make a constitution saving throw  taliesin that was very cocked thats a 23  laura all right you save against that so no worries now the other spider uses its turn to  stand back up  sam oh no hes still alive /none/  laura oh hes still alive he stands back up and he can get to about there  travis in melee  laura no lets say he cant get you yet hes very waterlogged hes uncomfortable  sam this is the most complicated fight ive ever seen  laura claire youre up  sam im up to move as a chess person or to attack as a person person  laura to attack as a person person  travis you have andy claire allison bryan  sam all right i will  travis be brave  liam if sam doesnt /none/ put lipstick on in the breakfast club fashion before this game is over i  will be sorely disappointed  laura you have to use your boobs  travis oh yeah  sam okay  travis if you havent watched breakfast club do it  sam wait am i trying to fight the chess pieces or the spiders  travis all of it everything theres no bad target a little of both is double whammy  laura you remember that beetle did send you down here to kill the spiders specifically  sam sure but we also want to win /none/ in chess okay i think im going to pick up my wand im feeling  a little cold today so im feeling like there should be a bit of a snowstorm and i will cast  snillocs snowball swarm  laura oh my god okay  sam centered here so everything around like this this and this  taliesin whats the range on it  travis i love how wands naturally lend themselves  laura i know its so great isnt it  brian you guys should just keep these here for the  sam 3d6 cold damage on a /none/ failed save of 14  laura okay so all of them need to roll okay wait ive got to say which one is which this  ones for the spider that one definitely saves this is for the knight and the pawn they both fail  sam so they each take 12 points of damage  laura okay  sam as the snowballs hit the spider takes six points of damage  travis nice  laura okay minus 12 and minus 12 on the knights  sam uhhuh are they alive  laura yeah theyre still alive theyre still standing /none/  liam oneshots is for prop comedy  travis yeah it is  taliesin its so true  laura yeah lets be honest next up is andy  taliesin well ive got one of these coming at me so im going to  sam should we move in our chess match as well  taliesin im going to do both but im going to attack first so im going to hit this thing with  my club im going to use the fire club first i can do some serious damage wow counting thats  18 points of damage to /none/ the spider  laura ooh okay  taliesin im going to hit him again thats ten points of damage hows the spider looking  laura hes still alive  taliesin if i walk away hes going to take a swing at me isnt he i think we should probably  move more of the pawns forward  sam sure  travis maybe clear a path for the queen  sam oh youve also got our other rook could make a shot at the spider  taliesin rook or pawn  sam and brian rook  laura you want to move /none/ the rook up here  sam will it attack or will it just stop  laura it will because its wizard chess the rook will move up and hell attack the giant spider  let me see the rook is shaped like a giant castle so its weird to see pieces of brick come  out and start flinging themselves at the giant spider but its going to happen he makes an  attack roll and he hits  travis and sam yeah  laura whoa he does a lot of damage oh my gosh i dont even think i /none/ have this many counting  what am i talking about i dont have this many i know ive got a whole bag but i didnt want to  pull it all out because okay  brian quietly thats what she said  laura ha mocking laughter  travis intones mario theme  sam howre
