none	 that have torn through the  entire taldorei countryside have then gone on this quest to collect allies and find these items  called the vestiges of divergence these artifacts of ancient wars that carry great power and seem to  be the best way you could prepare yourselves for going up against these terrifyingly powerful  entities in searching for this you went and made your way to vasselheim where you reacquired and  reestablished friendships with zahra and kashaw two allies from previous instalments of our  wondrous adventure as well as getting lady kima on loan from 
none	 the platinum sanctuary of bahamut  and you all went to seek the first bit of information you discovered about one of these  vestiges not too far from vasselheim the champion of the raven queens armor that had been  entombed within this temple that had sunken beneath a lake after traveling to this lake  finding your way through this subterranean watery location you found the location of the tomb upon  which a series of fish creatures called kuotoa had seemingly been worshiping another denizen of  this temple a rather strange slimecovered beholder that then surprised 
none	 the party the  battle hardfought you came out victorious and upon going to retrieve your spoils a trap was set  off in the tomb dodged by one survived by a bear and claimed the life of our beloved  vexahlia after a resurrection ritual attempted by kashaw the party helping they were successful  in bringing her soul back from the other side restoring her to life and the party then  figuring out what their next step in their journey was took their new allies via keyleths  teleportation via plants spell back to whitestone which seems 
none	 to be building as this  defensive bastion this currently not on the radar of the conclave location that needs defenses and  a good place to keep your allies at the time and that was where we left off as you guys had just  stepped back into whitestone  laura we havent actually slept yet then  matt nope  laura its late  marisha what time is it here  matt id say through the evenings travels well you guys slept all night the night before  you went to the temple the temples probably been  
none	 marisha thats true we did sleep actually we camped out  laura we did  marisha remember you talked to zahra and i talked to kash then we slept  matt yeah you guys did camp out  laura oh i didnt know if we camped i thought we talked  matt you talked  marisha we at least chilled i dont know  matt regardless you found your way to whitestone  well say for the sake of the current setting youve come in in a rather overcast midafternoon  in whitestone you may have spent some time there 
none	 gathering yourselves as your allies scope out  their new surroundings the people of whitestone accepting you as you arrive you can always see  people walking by and catching a glance at the group of heroes known as vox machina that helped  liberate them from the oppressive briarwoods not long ago  taliesin keep crawling out of trees  marisha its always weird not crawling out of trees that people like us  travis should we inspect our spoils  taliesin i was going to say we should take the armor and the necklace to the castle and 
none	 have it  inspected  laura is lady allura here  matt kima who is with you is like is she  laura no well she was on her way to westruun and we havent heard from her yet  taliesin no  matt havent heard from her since you say westruun was under attack as well  laura yes but she knew it she was going in secret  matt that prideful woman she slings her hammer off her shoulder and slams it to the ground and  says well if she doesnt arrive in the next few hours 
none	 im going to gather a party and were going  to go to westruun and find her  travis yeah  marisha kima wait what why  laura wait theres a dragon there kima a very large one and she was being very very  stealthy  matt her hammer slams into her metallic armor and she goes ive a much bigger dragon backing me up  and she looks up to the sky for a second and grins  travis lady kima dont give a fuck  laura well wait kima  matt frustrated sigh  laura going in 
tavern	 loud will only cause more trouble  matt ill wait a few days  laura she should be here by then  marisha i can always attempt to scry and see if i can check in on her  matt okay not a bad idea  marisha okay  matt okay i need a drink  marisha lets get somewhere safe  matt she charges off looking for the nearest tavern  marisha here i guess i dont know i forget its not overrun by vampires im sorry sorry i  forgot its all right now  laura maybe somewhere 
none	 safe like right here  marisha like right here sorry theres a lot going on  matt zahra and kashaw looking around expectantly as you continue this conversation kash crosses  his arms goes great place theres a lot of white of which zahra comes and steps over and is  like dont worry darling laughter so sleeping arrangements i hope  laura yes the castle  taliesin well be putting you up in the castle  matt thats what i like to hear all right to the castle kash  sure its better than well its better than anything 
none	  lets go for the castle and they both make their way towards  whitestone castle to find a comfortable place to get themselves situated in their new  surroundings  laura so were healed up we are healed we are not running the risk of dying at any moment  because weve been healed  matt what is that what is that blur of green  travis its a fucking leprechaun get it  sam sorry sorry sorry  liam you should be  marisha your shirt is that new because i love it so much  sam thanks 
tavern	 but im also wearing a tie because its a special night  laura right its a special occasion  sam sighs so is allura dead  laughter  travis kima just left so  laura shes on her way to a tavern kimas drinking it up grog kimas drinking it up  marisha are we heading to a tavern  taliesin were heading to the castle were going to talk to friends were going to take a look at  travis corpse armor hello  marisha oh corpse armor  travis yeah you know the thing that almost killed our 
none	 friend over here  laura it did kill me according to you  taliesin it yes  travis yeah but i mean youre here so you didnt die but you did but you didnt but you  did and then you didnt  laura thanks grog  travis yep  matt all right so you guys all heading to the castle  taliesin yes  matt you head to the castle cassandra isnt there at the moment but keeper yennen is currently  there with a few other members of the makeshift council you guys put together towards the end 
none	 one  of the heads of the entire farming establishment here in whitestone is with them and theyre  having a conversation as zahra and kashaw burst in first hes like im sorry were not  currently taking visitors could you oh friends of yours i presume  taliesin good friends  laura helpers actually theyre going to be here for a while hopefully  matt gracious oh i see you yourself carry the vestments of a man of the cloth who brings your  power this day  kashaw gives him a look and goes you dont even want 
none	 to know buddy walks past him  taliesin that was a really good kashaw  matt very well i assume theyre staying here as well  taliesin yes we appreciate it greatly  matt theyll be taken care of percival  taliesin they will be well worth your time we also have something that needs a bit of study we  found something we found two objects of power that we think may help us turn the table against  the dragons  laura two objects  matt this is good news  taliesin two objects  laura what was 
none	 the second  taliesin there was a necklace  laura there was  taliesin there was  sam you were dead  laura oh i must have missed it because i was dead thats right  matt dead  taliesin its been a very long day  sam mostly dead  marisha be very careful when handling this armor is what were trying to say  travis or dont handle it and well take care of it  matt so the armor is what killed you  laura no actually a trap that percival set off is what killed me 
none	  taliesin yes the  liam what  taliesin  trap was a bit it was a bit ah there was a trap and it was wellprotected  liam what  laura what what what what  taliesin yes what  laura what  travis mutters he didnt know that  laura what so these vestiges  matt vestiges  laura these leathers these things  matt um and he puts a couple of small armored like studdedleather gloves on and has  to carefully reach out for the vestments as you hand them and he grabs them give me 
none	 a bit of  time with them perhaps i need to clarify what this enchantment may be do you mind staying  around just in case  taliesin not at all  matt dont feel strange that i dont trust this but based on your history with it i would like a  little backup so he carries you off down the far hallway you didnt get this far into  whitestone when you initially came through but towards the back there was a small study area  converted into a research establishment largely set up for the ziggurat beneath 
none	 the city he  clears off an area of the table and sets this down and he takes some time working with the  vestments before he eventually and its this awkward quiet of hearing him mutter to himself and  bring out a symbol and bring over a minor enchantment to reveal information that tearing  into the divinity the divine magic that is granted to him before he says this carries the  mark of the raven queen a very strong mark ive not seen power like this in but an object  laura it was worn by 
none	 one of her champions the great purvan  matt thats a strange name  laura yeah  matt regardless it appears that this armor does help fortify ones defenses from any sort of  physical damage as well as give you a chance of surviving even the most dangerous of neardeath  experiences it also grants a fluid resistance to the elements here  and he hands it over and who would like to take this item card to  travis well you died for it you  laura i think i like it but ill just look at it 
none	  marisha its leather  laura its leather  matt so to give you the specifics on it its plus two to ac magical on top of the studded  leather armor plus two enchantment beyond just the studded leather armor it does give you  advantage on death saving throws  sam youll need that  matt as it is called the deathwalkers ward and once per short rest you can set it to be  resistant to one of the five types of damage  laura you choose which one  matt you choose you can change it 
none	 you can leave it all on one but if you want to change it during  a short rest you can shift it from fire or cold or lightning  travis acid or necrotic  sam youre like indestructible now  marisha do you have fancy leather armor right now what does your armor do right now anything  liam its acidresistant  laura my armors acidresistant i sort of stole it from my brother do you want your  acidresistant armor back then  liam whatever you want vexahlia  laura hes in such a sour mood lately  
none	 travis well yeah well what about the necklace  matt the necklace as well  taliesin i hand it over  matt he takes it and he goes well the chain on this necklace is not actually part of the  enchantment its merely to hold the crystal itself the crystal is the item of particular  interest here this oh wait a minute he takes it and he scans over the table and pulls up a  jewelers eyepiece and inspects it closely theres something inside this gem  travis uhoh  marisha groans not again  laura what 
none	 is it  marisha why do things like living in gems it cant be comfortable  travis it might be a worm  laura its like tequila  matt i cant actually ascertain the nature of whatever being is encased within this but  laura theres a being its a being  marisha encased  laura is it a soul gem  marisha like something put it in there  matt he takes a moment and concentrates on his holy symbol of pelor and you can see as he puts  aside the eyepiece his eyes glaze over with a 
none	 grayish frosted white color at which point he  inspects the gem very closely and theres this slight vibration in the air around him as soon as  it fades about a minute later he pulls back and goes this is referred to as the ravens slumber  its actually a small gateway to a tiny pocketplane  sam a pocketplane  marisha ooh  matt it can contain one creature you have to contact whatever it was and it cant be too big  but it can essentially contain something indefinitely within this  laura but somethings already in 
none	 there  matt something is already in this  travis awesome  sam something that we can summon  marisha any way we can find out what it possibly is before we summon it  matt unfortunately i do not have that capability  laura it was buried with  sam ill take that  laura oh thats really smart to give to scanlan  travis well like you said not too big though right  matt the confines of the space at least as part of the enchantment seem rather small a bit  larger than you maybe but 
none	 not much more than that  travis right right okay  matt here  travis please  marisha well does it change size  laura this is maybe the worst thing that scanlans ever held outside of that gun that you  had percy  travis what are you talking about can we take it in the woods open it up and if it sucks we kill  it and if not weve got a new pet  marisha we dont even know how to open it up do we know how to open it up  travis oh we 
none	 will find a way  laura it was buried with the raven queens champion i mean it could be incredibly  dangerous or it could be incredibly good and he trapped it and theyre bad right  liam the same could be said about your new pajamas  laura they are so beautiful i do like feathers  travis what do they smell like  laura sniffs like sniffs must and mold and birds really  travis laughing and birds eesh  matt so is that all you require of me  travis i require percy to tell us what 
none	 the fucks up with the necklace hes reading about  taliesin just what he said  laura yeah he already told us about it  sam once we release whatever is inside of it we can use this necklace as a weapon to  taliesin its a cage  sam to trap people  marisha hang on okay lets think about this what do we remember from the great purvans  story  laura well let me look at my book  marisha what did he fight  sam i just remember that purvans story touched me touched me in 
none	 inappropriate ways  travis laughing no no no  laura you know what i like about this particular piece of paper is that you made it on cardstock so  its extra special instead of the regular paper  matt its legendary  taliesin legendary cardstock  marisha can we get purple cardstock up in here  laura im talking to matt bitches okay i forgot what i was going to say oh my book my  30gold book does it say anything about what purvan fought  matt all right you read through there were many many things throughout 
none	 the war that were fought  entities from the nine hells there was a faction of the abyss that came in as a third bit of evil  in this whole conflict and while not in alliance against the other forces of chaos there were many  forces of chaos lashing out at what was nearby so the champions there was no specific entity that  was his chosen or at least what you can ascertain to be a specific being of hatred  although it does speak of purvan the champion of the raven queen keeping with him an 
none	 ally  laura like trinket  matt it doesnt say the nature of the ally it just says the dangerous and respected galdric  laura gasps galdric  taliesin well there are some options here  laura what  taliesin no that wont work damn it  travis well say it come on  taliesin well i was thinking we could find a safe place surround it let it out and if its  dangerous take care of it we could even take it down into the pits beneath the castle so that if  its a magical creature it 
none	 would be harmless except i dont know if we could actually release  it down there i dont know  laura yeah what if it touches the thing and it  sam theres also magic resistance down there  taliesin yeah which means it wouldnt work in the first place  marisha what if hes friendly i mean he talks about being an ally  taliesin it might be an ally  marisha well then wouldnt we want to save it  laura an ally of purvan an ally of purvans  taliesin yes  laura is purvan a good 
none	 guy  taliesin yes  laura i thought the raven queen was not good  taliesin no the raven queen  marisha shes like neutral  taliesin can i make a roll for this  matt make a religion check  taliesin okay thank you nope nope its st pattys day  travis dont kill anybody  laura yeah with these green dice  taliesin religion or history  matt and travis religion  taliesin 11  matt 11 the general essence of the raven queen she is both loved and feared in equal parts she  does not lord 
none	 over the afterlife the underworld whatever you may call it she lords over the  moment and the transition of death which is largely considered neither a good nor evil just a  natural force it could be accepted either way many men fear it and fear her for that reason  and there are those that instead embrace it as the inevitable as to the true nature of her intent  no one really knows its part of her mystique  travis so like even if we let out the glorious balllick or whatever his name is like if 
none	 hes  bad we cant really put him back in right  taliesin no we actually can actually we can put him back in  travis what we touch him with it and he goes back in  sam correct  matt after a saving throw  marisha maybe we should save him and release him when hell be valuable to us  taliesin so would a trap we could also trap other creatures  laura its like a poké ball right its like a pokémon  taliesin yes its exactly like a poké ball  marisha who knows if 
none	 hell go back in willingly  taliesin you dont have to go in willingly thats sort of the point  matt i guess you could technically use it that way yeah  marisha but wouldnt we rather be friendly with him than him be angry at us the next time we  release him  taliesin im more excited about the idea of carrying around an empty trap  marisha but we could win both but we could have a trap and a friend  liam i think percy is right that we should let it out now because its 
none	 a question mark no matter  what whatever its all theories we dont know what were getting into and better that it pop  out now on its own and not while were facing a fucking beholder  laura i think we should do it in the forest outside of vasselheim  taliesin or the forest outside of whitestone  sam vasselheim were here  marisha why dont we try and do a little bit more research on galdric first  sam that would be too careful  travis yeah come on come on  sam vex just open it 
none	  liam percival are there any libraries here  taliesin not really anymore  liam what about a personal collection in your family  taliesin didnt they ravage most of our collection  matt elements have been ravaged elements of family history have been destroyed so that there  couldnt be large connections or the end of the bloodline itself being too prominently displayed  within the castle itself there is still a library there though from your knowledge and youve  read through most of those books growing up a lot of them are loose history books a lot 
none	 of them  are more encyclopedialike general knowledge  taliesin she wasnt a revered deity in this part of the world we dont have a lot  laura all right yeah lets do it woods  travis woods woods woods  taliesin woods or vasselheim thats actually not a bad idea to get far away from whitestone  travis no because then somebody elsell come along and kill it  sam plus they dont like magic  taliesin this is sort of our secret and we should perhaps keep this  laura okay  taliesin well we were going to 
none	 go take a look at  marisha muffled what if  travis you got shit in your mouth  marisha we g mm sorry little bit of saliva  liam goodberries  marisha snacks we go to those goliath caves right outside of whitestone that were abandoned  travis stone giant caves  marisha those  travis shit made me feel like i had to poop for a second there goliath caves fuck  marisha sorry i just remembered you recognized them they were empty and abandoned we could go there  travis yeah  laura is that close to 
none	 your family  travis nope  marisha no we saw it on the way into whitestone  taliesin its just a couple hours away correct  laura oh  matt its id say roughly three three and a half hours northwest of here  laura lets do it  matt yeah its where the forest of the alabaster sierras ends and the actual alabaster sierra  mountain range begins is where that transitions  taliesin we can take a day and do this  laura all right sure lets do it all right what do you think good idea good 
none	 idea  liam sure yes yes yes keyleth had a good idea yes  matt all right so  laura were healed yes  taliesin yes  marisha were healed right did we sleep do we need to sleep  liam i thought we rested before we went down under the water though  laura no we did we didnt rest since then  liam i dont remember resting afterwards and i was there  travis i dont either i remember i peed on a lake and then we went under it  matt yeah i think you guys decided 
none	 instead of resting to come to rest here in whitestone  laura yeah we need to sleep yall  taliesin lets take a sleep and well do it in the morning  travis what time is it about  matt id say by now with as much time as you spent in the temple from waking up in the  morning its getting four in the afternoon five in the afternoon the suns starting to come down so  laura im going to cast cure wounds on myself  sam arent we going to sleep  laura but its four 
none	 in the afternoon theres other things to do today  marisha like drink  laura like find out how gilmores doing and see pike  marisha and i should probably scry and check in on allura right  taliesin ive got some work to do  matt its up to you guys yeah and youre starting to push towards the bottom of your  ammunition stack anyway percy  taliesin i need to yeah to do a little and ive got a little thing i want to work on  matt cool all right so whos doing what first  
none	 taliesin im going to take vax aside very quickly  travis lets do that first  taliesin i had a careless moment and i apologize and youre the first apology im  putting forward i dont know if i would have done anything different but i hope you know that i  wouldve never forgiven myself  liam whatre you talking about  taliesin i rushed in and triggered the trap that almost killed your sister  liam that killed my sister  taliesin i cant say that  liam what do you mean  taliesin i was careless  
none	 liam well what happened percival  taliesin i felt the danger had passed and i moved too quickly and opened the casket without  thinking thats all i just didnt think  liam you just opened it just like that  taliesin i was tired wasnt thinking sometimes we move too quickly but i want you to know that  it wouldve im very glad that shes alive because i dont think i could have lived with  myself  liam all right could you do me a favor  taliesin yes  liam in the future if there is 
none	 anything that your little heart desires inside of a box in the  future could you check with my sister or myself first  taliesin thats the hope yes that was more of a lesson than i was hoping for thankfully not too  much of one  liam well  taliesin and none of us are beyond mistakes but that is a mistake that i am going to be  thinking about for a very long time we are going into dangerous territory and we all have to think  a little bit more and she especially i i 
none	 couldnt  liam well listen percy we are not playing a game  taliesin no  liam and we will all make mistakes and i wager i will make my fair share ive little doubt and  percival i want to apologize im sorry but  and i punch him in his knowitall fucking mouth  matt do you attempt to move out of the way or take it  taliesin yeah lets take it  matt all right impact sound decks you square in the for as hefty as a punch it was doesnt  hurt quite as much 
none	 as you expected but its not the physical pain that hurts more than the action  and the knowledge that there are more repercussions to your rash decision than even you  initially anticipated  liam goodnight percival  taliesin goodnight vax  sam its four in the afternoon  laughter  taliesin im going to work im going into my studio  matt all right who else wants to do something  marisha whered kima go  matt kima is actually shes begun daydrinking into the night so yeah shes currently by  herself in one of the few 
tavern	 functional taverns in whitestone its fairly empty at the moment  especially at this hour as the sun slowly sets shes not heavy drinking but shes definitely  nursing a tankard and quietly contemplating as she sits at the edge of the bar with her hands around  the tankard shes staring at her reflection as she spins it slowly on the wood you can hear it  scuffing on the woodgrain  marisha anyone else want to go to the  laura im going with you yeah  matt theres like a few other random patrons but no one 
tavern	 catches your eye no one specifically  sam ill come too well actually wait grog whatre you doing  travis nothing yet  sam im with grog  matt okay so the two of you into the tavern she doesnt notice you guys  marisha i go up and put my hand on her shoulder  matt keyleth  marisha hey hows it going  matt better  marisha yeah  laura i lean up against the bar next to you guys  marisha want to check in on allura  matt lets do it  marisha is there an 
tavern	 empty room around here  matt she looks over to the barkeep you all stare over and the barkeep is currently there like  wiping down the bar section for how long  laura for a couple hours  marisha doesnt need to be that long  matt two silver  laura we saved your life and the entire town  matt you are fine to use it as you please for the remainder of the afternoon just dont mess it  up please  marisha sure well try really hard to find better things to do with our time 
tavern	 okay  matt all right you make your way up and the place is fairly vacant there are a couple of  rooms that are currently partially the doors are ajar and you hear voices in there and you  recognize its a couple of the refugees that you guys brought over from your keep currently holed  up in this tavern an inn floor on the second floor but there are a number of open rooms right  now that you could go ahead and step into for use  marisha just pick one  matt okay so do 
none	 you want to go ahead and attempt a scry ritual  marisha yes  matt focusing on  marisha the flower that i gave her before we left  laura ooh good call  matt all right so as you all sit down kima sitting across from you arms closed she looks at  you intensely with this really direct glare waiting for some sort of sign of an answer or  information as you complete the ritual preparation of the scrying your vision transcends  your form jettisoned through the ceiling and into the clouds clouds rush past you 
none	 can feel the  wind pushing across your face your hair and as the clouds part you see below you see westruun  and from westruun you can see most of the city as you recall and a large portion of it currently  looks toppledover and pushed into ruin there are no longer burning black clouds but white smoke  long after a fire or some sort of an impact lazily drifting off some of those ruins it  focuses even closer and you see very little populace in the streets most everyones either  indoors or not visible 
dung	 at the moment your vision clicks in once again and you can see currently  some sort of dark room hidden in westruun you see for a brief instant a flicker of light and  you see drake thunderbrand and allura both gathering a few small books under their arms  silently waiting quietly you hear impact sounds some heavy footfalls above they both just  stay quiet stay quiet allura stays still for a moment she looks over at drake they both take  hands and then whoosh convert into that same energy form you saw that jettisoned out 
none	 of  greyskull keep that echoes down a long hallway that you previously didnt see was attached to  this room it leads to a stone spiral staircase that goes upward before these two dual sparks  travel through the small crack between where the edge of a trap door and a wooden floor is as the  sparks course upward into the nowsetting sun you can see amongst the sparks the mostly collapsed  rubble of the cobalt reserve the large library in the center of westruun you can see dozens of  corpses that have been largely dissolved 
dung	 you can see what remnants of their bodies have been eaten  away by some sort of caustic material their arms and fingers tightened up as the muscles pull into  this horrible gnarled visage of what once were the living residents of westruun you do see as  the spark comes to a stop for a second in its movement and you hear briefly overhead wingbeats  and you see rush overhead wings fully spread the black dragon that you had briefly  encountered in emon streak upward roaring loudly towards gatshadow the tall dark spire mountain  just 
tavern	 north of westruun whoosh and as it heads up there the sparks electric sound continue  their trek through the streets and at that point the ritual fades its vision unable to maintain  its focus your vision is pulled back up into the clouds and then thrust back into your current  position and with a shock you find yourself back in the tavern  laura what did you see is she all right  marisha shes alive her and drake both are alive  matt good where are they going  marisha theyre at the cobalt reserve which 
none	 is in ruins as well as the rest of westruun  laura did you see the dragon  marisha yes the black dragon is there looks like hes taken up residence in the black spire  tower what was it called  laura gatshadow  marisha that one  marisha gatshadow allura  laura could you communicate with her when you scry i dont know how it works  marisha no i can just look in and see  laura all right  marisha she was grabbing the last few important tomes remnants left from the cobalt library i  
none	 mean reserve  matt they staying in westruun  marisha it didnt look like it  matt where are they going  marisha i dont know i didnt see  matt did you talk about where you  laura we left word and told her we were coming here  matt here to whitestone  laura yes if you wait shell be here  matt who else is coming  laura drake  matt drake anybody else on the council coming  sam we brought some council members right were any among our  matt youre not there youre with

none	 were two of the ones that were saved by gilmore and then once he was too wounded to  continue they left to seek for survivors in emon that was the last you heard of them  laura oh theyre not actually here then yes theyre looking for other survivors tofor and asum  matt in the place where this and whats this dragon you keep talking about  laura oh shit you dont know anything thordak big terrible red  matt as you say the name again you can see her eyes resonate with a clarity and where once 
none	 was  this very intense expression and air of demanding information suddenly recedes into this look of  sudden fear and shes briefly lost in thought  laura yes you defeated him once he escaped the fire realm  marisha not only did he escape he tore a giant tear in the rifts between the fire realm and ours  matt sighs deeply thordak and you can see shes starting to hyperventilate suddenly like  for all of her strong exterior this is the first time aside from the brief hit of the beholders  ray earlier you see fear 
none	 in her eyes and she starts standing up pants i need to get some air  marisha kima kima itll be  matt i need to  marisha sit here you want to sit down  matt i need to get s i need to get some air  and she storms out of the room  marisha lets go outside  laura actually keyleth  marisha what  laura i shut the door behind kima  marisha okay  laura i want to talk to you  marisha yeah  laura i would ask my brother but knowing him

none	 to know what it is  marisha we all watched you die  laura yes  marisha its like  laura how did i get back who brought me back kashaw zahra my brother anyone else  marisha i guess you could say probably an unseen entity an unseen force oh im  lightheaded  laura sit down  marisha okay  laura theres a bed sit down  marisha percy  laura percy helped  marisha lets skip that when we brought you back kashaw performed a resurrection ritual  laura like we did with pike  marisha yes 
none	 and he called upon a deity and at first he was afraid that it was vesh which he was  quite terrified about  laura his wife  marisha yes that i dont believe is the presence that answered his call  laura okay fluttery words here darling get to the point  marisha i thought i was going to lose you both i thought i was going to lose you and vax  laura why vax did he get hurt as well no what did he do  marisha he i dont know i dont know what he did 
none	 he said to take him instead is what he told  the entity he offered his life for yours and my biggest fear was that neither of you were going to  come back he offered his life for you and for all we know that offer was accepted  laura right  marisha if i had to guess it was probably the raven queen herself  laura well its rather suiting isnt it  marisha he seems to do that quite a lot  laura yes keyleth thank you dear and i leave  matt okay  marisha i 
dung	 stay behind and burst into tears  matt okay grog and scanlan whatre you guys doing  relieved laughter  liam grog voice go fish  travis so what do you want to do  sam i dont know i hadnt really thought about it do you have any games with you  travis no  sam anything in the bag of holding  travis i think theres some orc parts in there thatve been in for a couple months  sam doesnt sound very fun  travis right i got all nervous when they mentioned a goliaths cave so 
none	 i need to go  boomboom  sam should i play a song so no one can hear it  travis might help like stand guard outside the door  sam yeah yeah a little muzak  travis would you mind  sam its what im here for  travis can i go drop some ordnance  matt and as you find one of the few local ramshackle outhouses none are quite  goliathsized and its an uncomfortable experience but thank god you brought a bard along  or you would have woken up half the populace just going to 
none	 bed as scanlan i  sam nothing to see here everybody plays random chords on the harmonica nothing to see here  travis coughs then farts oh  laura okay okay okay okay  laughter  travis now the musics playing right  matt yeah  travis its just a stall just me  matt yeah yeah  travis all right can i take out craven edge  matt yeah  travis all right  marisha in the outhouse sorry keep going  travis its the palace this is where all the best thoughts and conversations happen i dont  
none	 know how it is at your house  liam keep in mind how confined it is okay  travis yeah  liam and go  laughter  matt yes grunting  sam sounds like a rough one in there buddy  matt as you chuckles as you see one of the wood boards splinter out the side for a second  sam ah yup thats tacos  travis you might want to play a bit louder and maybe take a few steps away its about to get violent  sam no problem  travis yep  matt at that moment 
dung	 you focus and as you can feel the blade itself grow cold in your fingertips  you can see what little bit of light that filters through the bright orangishred color thats  coming from the sunset you can see a reflection in the obsidian blade as a voice comes to your ear  and says you fed me well  travis yeah i did right i mean we are really doing well question so when we were fighting  that big earthbreaker grootlooking guy he called you a dark weapon does that do you have  feelings and did 
none	 that hurt them  matt theres a brief pause before you hear this long drawnout heavy sigh  travis right hold on no no listen and i take my thumb and i run it against the blade real quick  matt okay as you do all of a sudden the voice goes gasp contented exhale  travis right yep sorry listen so my question is as much as i love opening up people to feed  you i want to know like whats in it for you  sam grog are you talking to your shit  travis yeah no 
none	 you got to let it know whos boss  sam okay  matt the voice creeps in again this time there is no feeling more terrifying than hunger and i  hunger forever you help satiate that hunger that is our arrangement i give you the strength of  those you cut down and i feed upon them if this is unsatisfactory i can and have found others who  are more willing to be part of this arrangement  travis no no no im a big fan really i mean i am yoked out when im using you its 
none	 fucking  amazing i mean people are flying apart its like a dream but listen can you ever be full  matt i have never been full before perhaps youre the one to find out  travis ill bet i am actually youre really lucky you found me and not these other blokes not  even half the man i am but listen so theres no like endgame just to be clear you just want  to drink and drink cause ive seen the blood right and usually i wipe it off but you like  suck it in and 
none	 thats a little unsettling not going to lie  matt my hunger grows but the air tarnishes my blade perhaps we can continue this conversation  elsewhere  travis farts right yeah right not even a problem well look i like the way you cut  people open so well continue this another time and i sheathe him  matt all right as you sheathe the last thing he says is dont forget i hunger always  travis i kick the door open and im like if youre within 200 feet back up  sam no ones out here grog 
none	  travis oh  sam just me are you all right  travis yeah  sam i heard you say something about blood  travis yeah no am i sweating it was a real workout that one  sam at some point you said are you full are you talking about did you fill it all the way up  travis yeah the privy you know it was starting to give my bum a tickle  sam wow  travis yeah  sam you topped it off  travis yeah because you know you dont want to like dip in 
none	 the muck its you know  laura foul  sam not at all  travis did you want to  sam i think im good  travis are you sure i warmed it up for you its like ready to go  sam i love a good deuce but not today i think  travis all right fair enough but im feeling so like vacated  sam we should go get a bite  travis i think youre right  sam laughs all right lets go  travis laughing okay  matt okay you guys are getting a bite percival 
none	 if you want to go ahead and make a tinkering check  with dexterity modifier to create more ammunition  taliesin tinkering check with dexterity modifier  matt yes  taliesin okay  matt should be plus 11  taliesin 16  matt 16 okay well say in the time that youve had here with the materials you purchased and  whitestones pretty open to supplying you  taliesin ive got a thing  matt yeah id say youre able to create roughly 40 or so simple bullets in the time that you have  taliesin do i have time 
none	 to poke at a modification to the explosive arrow i want to try and build a  rock breaker im curious to try and build an arrow for taking down walls or taking down doors  matt like a siege arrow  taliesin a light form of siege arrow basically i want to have a tip that actually manages to  breach stone and then an explosion that goes outwards so its a shattering arrow  matt all right thisll take the remainder of your evening youre not going to be able to do  much else after this  
none	 taliesin i have nothing else to do  matt all right go ahead and make a tinkering check with your intelligence modifier  taliesin okay so thats 23  matt 23 okay at the cost of roughly 150 gold pieces as you have to go through a few different  attempts to finally get the design right and the metalworking you have here is not perfected  youre not at your workshop back at the keep unfortunately so you have to work with whatever  you have here and nothing here is designed for the  taliesin no ive got 
none	 an okay workshop here  matt yeah the one that you used before previously but thats from mostly discarded  and in the time that youve been gone its been cannibalized for a lot of different uses but its  makeshift you manage to complete what you think could function youre not entirely certain as to  what the final effect will be but it all seems to be in place  taliesin all right  matt so you can write down explosive siege arrow  taliesin siege arrow  matt and we shall find out in time what it 
none	 does  marisha siege arrow thats fun  taliesin a few things ive been working on and thats one of them  matt so are you guys resting for the evening anything else you wish to accomplish  laura that would probably be smart im pretty tired after dying so im going to go to sleep  matt okay vax anything you want to accomplish before you  taliesin god the guilt okay yeah  sam can i buy a torch somewhere just a torch  matt sure yeah torches are relatively easy to find you want to try one 
tavern	  sam three  matt three torches thats three copper  laura i bring trinket into the castle with me just so you know  matt after all this has happened trinket has been like almost locked to you even you going  upstairs into the tavern trinket was like plaintive bear noises stayed out front cause  trinkets learned at this point you cant really go into all the taverns  laura its hard its hard  matt its rough being a bear  sam and wherever were eating does it happen to be near jameson the painters workshop 
none	  matt no but its about a 20minute walk if you wanted to go find him  sam be nice to check in with him grog do you mind walking with me  travis absolutely not  sam all right so well truck on over to jamesons  matt okay you head up to it and this gentleman is a painter as well as a stablehand so you find  your way to the facility knock on it and immediately as the door opens the smell of fresh  manure hits your nose and jameson steps out can i you 
town	  sam yes hi  matt hi  sam ive come back  matt i meant to deliver but they told me not to because apparently its not there anymore  sam the town you mean  matt town yeah where i was supposed to deliver it to you  sam it was wise of you to keep this precious artifact here because it wouldve surely been  destroyed en route or when it arrived  matt its just the canvas i dont have a its a bit too large for my specifications of framing but  sam im sure 
none	 its huge did you finish it  matt yes yes come come  sam can i look  travis oh please oh please  sam laughing okay lets go look  matt he takes one of the hooded lanterns and turns up the oil wick on it and as he turns away  he brings you into the back stable area where its been sectioned off and you can see theres paints  that have been dropped all across the ground and the hay its this multicolored spattering this  rainbow vomit across this section of hay floor and there 
none	 in all of its glory stretched across  and nailed at the corners to this far far wall you see a fantastical landscape of rolling hills  and treelines rising up at the edges you can see a mountainscape in the distance the lighting he  uses is magnificent you can see why many people in the city specifically requested that you go to  this gentleman there atop this fantastic green hilltop you see on this fine white and grey steed  as it raises up hooves in the air is yourself shirt open chest slightly fuzzy and muscular 
none	 as  you look off your hair blowing in the breeze  sam hows the face hows the face  matt the face is pretty damn spoton  sam yes  laughter  matt the best likeness you can find for somebody who only had a brief reference as he sketched you  quickly before he left and there behind clutching you from the side you can see pike  wearing these long greyishsilver and blue robes that are also flowing behind a long train  longer than it needs to be stylistically it was a choice in the artistics 
none	 point of this it is  everything you hoped it would be you paid good money for this piece  sam im going to request grog i need a minute here  travis oh yeah i understand take  sam just to weep  travis take all the time you need  sam so i regard it for a few minutes taking in the beauty and the wonder of all ive  accomplished  marisha i have a question would keyleth and scanlan be crying in rooms at the same time  matt right now yes for different reasons entirely 
none	  sam and taliesin singing somewhere out there  travis look at the air look at the air highfive there it is  sam taliesin and marisha singing beneath the pale moonlight  travis so white that was the whitest of white high fives ever  taliesin im imagining this as a canvas of lisa frank majesty by the way like the greatest lisa  frank trapper keeper cover in all the land  matt oh man  laughter  sam after i weep for a few minutes i thank jameson again and how much did i pay him for 
none	 this  thing youve gone above and beyond jameson and i know that youre a humble man and you dont want  me to spread word of your accomplishments but please allow me to write you an epic poem or a  song and tell of your artistic gifts and talents please  matt that would be a fine tip sir please yes do so  sam ill get right on it  matt send them back to whitestone please ask for jameson the more i work this hopefully i can  make my way out of this dunghole  
none	 sam dont worry youll have lots of commissions after this i promise you  matt great  sam and im going to give him an extra 50 gold  matt i um  liam thats more than the price of a book  matt sir i thank you thank you thank you  sam for art supplies to get your shop up and running  matt of course he looks down and hes gotten a little bit of paint on the coins hes like  muttering and stammering he puts it aside somewhere thank you wipes his hands off on 
none	 a  nearby rag thank you and takes your hand and shakes it vigorously  sam so can it be  matt yeah he goes in and he takes his little claw hammer down starts pulling the nails out  from the sides and gingerly rolls up the canvas it takes a good like three minutes to roll the  thing up and its quite heavy as he hands it over to you heavy grunt in your hand yeah it  almost takes you off your feet  sam grog grog  travis what  sam can you hold this 
none	 for me  travis no its you i mean youre so magnificent in it  sam no i cant do it  travis i dont know it i really  sam grog i watched you shit for an hour  travis hey all right ill pick it up  matt all right you guys find your way out at this point night has taken you can hear the  crickets starting to spread throughout the city as the rest of the blue night sky takes on  evening is ready do you guys have anything else to accomplish before the 
none	 evening comes to a close  liam wait til its quiet and i leave the room that ive been given at whitestone and i find my  sisters door and i stand outside it and i stare at it for a minute  laura vax is that you  liam and i stealth away  laura i open the door  matt roll a stealth check roll a perception check  laura shit  liam 25  laura 22 damn it  matt nothing to be seen must have been your imagination vex  travis hes good  liam and 
none	 i wait for the door to close and then i walk to keyleths door and i knock  matt you hear a knock at your door  laura and horses  matt the clomping of horse hooves in the distance apparently  marisha i open it hey hi you okay  liam i dont know  marisha come in sit down  liam i go in  matt okay  marisha how do you feel  liam i dont know all i know is that i felt her i dont know magic i dont know anything i  open doors 
none	 and only when the wind is blowing in the right direction sometimes i think i dont  know what happened but i felt her  marisha do you still feel her  matt make a perception check vax  liam 22  matt as youre sitting there looking down at the ground as she asks this question you notice the  symbol of sarenrae that you have stitched into the back of your glove what was once a very vibrant  goldishbrass color has actually very heavily tarnished and the metal itself seems to have  cracked in three places 
none	 it was not this way a day before  liam yeah i dont know if i did anything in there and i wouldnt take it back if i did but i  dont know what im doing  marisha i dont know if it was very noble or very stupid to be honest probably a little bit of  both i can attempt a greater restoration spell and see if i can sense anything  liam i dont know anything about any of that ill let you  marisha can i  matt yeah so as you prepare your mindset 
none	 for the cleansing ritual that is the greater  restoration  marisha just lay back  matt as soon as the dull green energy begins to course across your fingertips and as you touch  the edge of his shoulder to impart his body with the cleansing energy it courses through his  shoulders the spell completes you sense no difference in your current physicality mindset  and theres this pause this silence of no realization that is suddenly shattered by the  sound of a caws you look over and at the stone edge of the window you guys 
dung	 are staying in you  see stepping there a single dark raven clicks rapid flapping and it takes off and flies into  the night  marisha i think this goes beyond any natural realm that i have any bearing over and i hug him  i thought i was going to lose you and im terrified im still going to  liam keyleth i love you  marisha and i think i love you i just dont know if i can allow myself to im terrified to allow myself  to you do realize that if by some crazy 
none	 chance we all somehow make it through this domination  alive with the chroma conclave and i complete my aramente ill still watch all of you die  everything could go phenomenally well and by becoming headmaster we enter a bit of a realm of  immortality where i could live for a very very long time im afraid every time i look at one of  your faces that its going to be the last and i feel like deep down i know that day is coming so  because of that im afraid to let myself feel anything 
none	 deeper than i already do  liam i quickly leave her room  matt the door closes behind vax  marisha and for the second time today keyleth bursts into tears why do people keep leaving me  in rooms alone  matt all right  taliesin stop it youre wasting water  marisha were in a drought god damn it  laura when was the last time you showered keyleth  marisha its been a while  taliesin makeups runny  liam go water elemental  matt its the only way all right as you all find yourself coming 
none	 to rest for the evening some of  you easier than others eventually you get your full rest those who heal up to say full hit  points for a good nights rest here get your hit dice back so not a whole lot were spent  travis i lose my strength bonuses  matt morning comes to you all and yes  liam sorry just one detail from there i went and fell asleep in this idiots doorway  matt okay all right we will go ahead and take a quick break we will see you guys back here 
none	  shortly to see what is in store for vox machina so well be back here in a minute  break  liam matt shit on my face  matt welcome back everybody  sam its too close  laura they caught it that one caught it  matt that was pretty close  liam all they heard was ace  matt its all good welcome back guys were going to go ahead and jump back in so as you all  after that for some emotional evening whether that be conversational emotion or you know  having to go 
town	 drop an emotional deuce you know thats important you find yourselves waking up to  a fresh morning in whitestone hints of blue sky breaking through the cloud coverage and thats  rare for this area because its the northern portion of the continent you know that  especially being so close to the ocean a lot of the cloud heavy precipitation makes its way in  the direction of your town so its nice to have a little break in that nonetheless as you guys  come to consciousness and gather yourselves your things and your plans for the 
none	 day what do you  wish to do  taliesin we are a city of seasonal affectation disorder so  laura well i open my door and find my brother falling through it  liam im awake  laura oh good morning  liam hi  laura comfortable bed i see  liam yeah sorry i couldnt find my room  laura yeah its confusing all these all these doors  liam what times it  laura i have no idea my nature check tells me its roughly i dunno eight nine something like  that seven maybe seven

none	 and see vax in the armor  matt are you putting on the armor  liam im just looking at it in the hallway  marisha so i guess i step out and see him looking at it in the hallway  liam still pretty tired to be honest didnt sleep a lot in the doorway  matt yeah some of you guys step out and you see vax standing in the hallway clutching in his  hands looking over all the various like pushedin engraved runes across the leatherwork  the raven feathers that adorn the bottom of the 
none	 mantle  laura careful it smells a lot like must and mold and birds  marisha i walk by and briefly lock eyes and keep going without saying anything  matt okay  travis oh shit you got the armor now  laura he stole it what can i say he is a really sneaky stealthy kind of guy  travis nice  laura yeah fair and square  liam i just took it for fashion purposes i suppose  travis oh you need all the help you can get  liam yeah  sam should we go out in

none	 your way northwest of whitestone towards where you  found the stone giant fortress and the series of caves that are in the mountain behind it you get  there its still seemingly abandoned you case the area for a while no noticeable movement other  than a few woodland entities that exist in that vicinity  laura primeval awareness radar sounds  matt okay that is now the sound it makes every time you do it  laura i like it  matt yeah so hold onto that one ill make that a new ringtone sound for you guys

none	 that leads up into a small ravine in the mountain pass where you guys  originally walked down into whitestone up against the north side of where the mountain meets that  ravine theres a big stone fortress that is built into the side of the mountain and then around  that are a series of smaller caves  liam singing anything can happen in the woods  travis yeah lets go to this fortress then we got more room to move in case it does suck  sam all right fine fortress  matt you guys find your way 
none	 inside the cold morning air still has encompassed the stone floor  itself you can see there are still the scattered and slowly decomposing bits of meat and flesh in  the far corner you still see the splatters of blood that have turned black and cracked as it dried no  corpses here as the corpses were retooled by the briarwoods while they were in control the  fortress other than that is still empty and seemingly untouched since you last left it  sam all right well im just going to do it then  laura and marisha 
dung	 wait wait wait  marisha wait theres doors open to the cave right  sam and taliesin were in a fortress  marisha fortress whatever  matt laughs coffees just starting to kick in for you guys  laura just barely do we have any buff spells or some shit that we should cast to make us cooler  marisha should i throw a wall up  sam a wall for what  marisha do i need to bar the entrance or are there doors  taliesin vex by the way  matt there are doors but theyre partially ajar

none	 not a bad idea you get controlled by things maybe you could wait just  a little bit further back  laura this was somebodys pet all right its probably not smart enough  to take control of our minds  liam thats a big if  travis i dont mind stepping out but i would like to be able to see  laura yeah yeah yeah  liam yeah we wont shut the door i just want you outside of any potential blast radius  taliesin lets spread out in a circle well let it loose in the center 
none	 that way it cant even see  all of us  laura all right i like it it only gets to see scanlan  sam it can see me  laura im going to stealth  sam well when a thing is born it latches on to the first thing it sees like its mama  liam yes were going to hide  matt all right stealth check from both of you guys  marisha so were going to try and talk to it  laura yeah scanlans going to talk to it  marisha scanlan you prepared  laura 
none	 natural 20  taliesin you just teleport theres like a phase effect  matt the two of you back off and find the nearby shaded corners where some of the haphazardly  tossed hides and furs are in the corner you vanish behind the alcoves keeping a watch  laura trinket dont stand next to me it gives it away go stand next to keyleth  travis is there a doorway in the fortress  matt yeah theres the main doorway you guys entered which is two  travis can i stand in that then  matt sure you stand 
none	 there in the entranceway thats pushed open which is wide enough for a  giant to push through you got a little bit of room to each side but youre there  travis vax is this g vax  taliesin its fine youre fine  sam here we go guys  marisha so those two are stealthed im at scanlans left shoulder back a bit  laura and trinkets next to you  marisha and trinkets next to me im rolling with trinket  taliesin ive got a little bit of distance yes thats good  matt all righty and 
none	 theres percy here and travis is off this way good to know  sam i dont know how to use this thing  marisha yeah we dont know how to use it  sam by the power of ravens slumber i command thee yells awaken beast cruel or otherwise  face your new master and know his name is scanlan  laughter  travis laughing oh holy shit never couldve been better  matt as you spend your bonus action to release the gate hold on the crystal you guys see as he  thrusts his hands forward theres a 
dung	 burst of shadow energy that almost like someone throwing a  big pot of water this blackness goes out of it and then as it hits the ground it spills into  smoke on the ground and as that dark form stops it is in the form of an about  waisttolowertorsoheight creature as the form coalesces into its normal self you can see before  you shaking its head a rather large dark grey and black wolf growls snarls  sam easy easy  travis told you it was a dog  sam garlic galdric galdric easy galdric easy 
none	 were friends here  matt hes backing up a little bit snarling you see trinket starts growling growls  laura trinket be nice oh  matt as you say that snarls it looks over at you in the far corner  laura whispers im natural 20 that still didnt see me  marisha i pet trinket like chill chill be cool  matt trinket backs up a little bit but still locking eyes you can see this wolf now its gums  and teeth are bared its fur is all puffed up its tail is its definitely holding its ground 
none	 and  trying to make itself look as intimidating as possible  sam is it a small beast  matt this would be technically borderline medium thisd be medium technically  sam i can only speak with small beasts  marisha wait use speak with animals  liam laughs she swatted me and said put your armor on so im doing it  matt okay thatll take you about 15 minutes  laura aw  liam 15 minutes well guess im doing it  matt all right you dont just slip on leather armor chuckles  liam no i get 
none	 that i get that i wouldve guessed two minutes  travis can somebody check to see if its actually a wolf or just looks like one like check it  laura can i use my perception  matt youre a bit far away from it right now you can try to get closer if you want  laura can i sneak  matt yeah make another stealth check  laura i do get advantage because of my cloak sweet  liam you should yell out im stealthing  laura im stealthing damn it 19  matt okay as you begin 
none	 making your way forward it doesnt seem to notice you  laura hey it doesnt  matt no  laura can i see it better now to perceive it  matt looking right at it and from your experience in the wild as well and keyleth  youre getting it this does not appear to be anything beyond a large wolf  taliesin im going to get on my knees and put out my hand and call it  galdric galdric  matt go ahead and make an animal handling check  sam animal handling weve never done that before 
none	  laura if i help my brother get on the armor will it happen faster  matt probably  laura i help him put on the armor  matt okay  liam whispering ow ow ow thats too tight  laura well youre not the same size as the other guy  taliesin yeah its a little bit better ten  matt ten as you put out your hand galdric snarls and as you say here boy  growls and snaps it lashes out at your hand  that is going to be thats a 21 to hit  taliesin 
none	 ill take it  travis keyleth cant you talk to like plants and shit  matt you take six points of piercing damage as its jaws clench down on your hand and you tear  your hand away you can feel the warmth flowing under the glove  taliesin gently im gentle with it  marisha i cast speak with animals  liam i click my boots of haste  matt you do  sam arent you getting dressed  laura he can dress faster  travis speed change  matt all right  travis quick change  sam sevenandahalf 
none	 minutes  laughter  matt you guys all become immediately aware of the creaking of leather in the distance as the two  siblings are in the process of fastchanging one of the other  laura the rustle of feathers  marisha okay i cast speak with animals and i crouch down to the ground and bow down a little  bit and i say are you the one they call galdric  matt looks over at you for a second the growl stops and its posture changes a little bit it  raises its nose sniffs  marisha was 
none	 purvan your master  matt looking at you as you guys hear keyleth making this series of growling sounds  laura trinket totally understands you no  matt strangely enough trinket does trinkets like confused bear noise  taliesin trinket is scoobydoo apparently  travis shitballs taint you going that way  marisha oh my god i get a secret  sam there are several items that are sold out at the store if youd like to go on and see what  items have already sold out check it out laughs  laura we need to get more tshirts 
none	 in stock  sam yeah we know that we know that guys we know  laura that needs to happen but there is still the critical role logo tshirt available what is  happening what is he  sam is there a ring or something  laura is the ring still available  sam i dont know  laura if the ring is still available check out our ring  marisha i can respond back right your master died a great champion for the raven queen he has  been paid a great honor and now the raven queen has 
none	 chosen a new master  laura i push vax forward  matt youve gotten maybe part of the tunic on  laughter  sam is he donaldducking it right now  matt practically there are undergarments but not much its like bare legs and knees part of  an arm yeah he got thrust out of the changing room about 20 seconds into it  sam nice  liam i still walk toward the wolf  taliesin waddle  liam no no no i did the top i did the top cmon  matt the wolf turns his head a 
none	 little bit curiously  marisha i continue to speak to the wolf  liam and i kneel and bow my head  marisha a great darkness has fallen upon our lands upon othanzia we could use all of the  assistance that we can achieve would you be willing to find a new purpose join vaxildan  liam keyleth  marisha yes  liam tell him to come forward and look into my eyes  laura whispers thats a bad idea for dogs  liam tell him  laura whispers its gonna bite your face off  marisha galdric please 
none	 approach your new master and look into his eyes  laura give him some chocolate man  matt the wolf looks towards you looks towards the loosely halfdressed halfelf  marisha look into his eyes i said look into his eyes and see the touch of the raven queen inside  of him  matt wolf slowly stalks towards you across the stone floor you can hear the claws of the wolf  clattering against the stonework as you can see its partially like digging into the stonework  with each step it has purpose with each stride  liam 
none	 as its coming im taking daggers out and throwing em on the ground  matt the wolf stops and looks up at you turns around and walks towards the doorway where you are  sam where who is  matt where grog is grog whos now at the door at the exit  laura whispers whats his name  taliesin and marisha galdric  marisha galdric  matt keeps walking  laura galdric  sam going to stop him grog  travis well im in the doorway  marisha grog dont move dont move look at the dog dont move 
none	 and dont hurt the dog please  just look at the dog  laura i pull out one of my treats i have for trinket  matt okay trinket starts lumbering up towards you thudding  laura wait wait trinket this is for your buddy galdric galdric  matt just keeps walking doesnt even look at you in the face walks  laura i throw the treat and say hey  matt it scatters across the stone walks between your legs and exits out  travis i pivot on my back foot i take out craven edge  taliesin no 
none	  travis no i do i take out craven edge and i sink it into the earth right beside his head and  i say shouts heel  matt make an animal handling check  laura whoa is it good is it good  travis 20  matt as the sword crack into the rock outside of this fortress it probably embeds itself a good  foot and a half into the mountain you guys all hear grogs shout echo through the inside of the  fortress itself causing little bits of dust and small pebbles to dislodge from the 
none	 roof slowly  fall down the wolf has stopped and spun in its place and reached out and lashed the blade with  its jaws and cling as it releases it  travis stay  matt he sits  travis that went well  laughter  sam dog whisperer  travis good pup  sam are you its master now  travis no no i dont think it has a master this is a very powerful beast but it needs a firm  hand and i think it needs a job so what do we plan to do with galdric 
dung	 said his name right  sam yeah  laura we plan on having him help us kill some dragons  taliesin i think hes a wolf i think perhaps something a little less ambitious  laura trinket hides very well when dragons are around  taliesin i think perhaps joining the whitestone conclave might be a having him  guard whitestone perhaps  laura good yeah i like it  travis i reach into the bag of holding and i pull out one thing of dry food rations and a probably  pretty rotten chunk of dark elf brain  
dung	 liam where did we get that  travis oh theres a veritable walmart of shit in this bag  laughter  travis and i like a hamburger patty smash it all together  matt the only reason you even know this was at one point dark elf brain matter is because thats  what you willed to reach in and find it does not at all visually match your memory of its  travis does it have a little bit of a viscousy ooze mostly  matt oh yeah no its  travis itll soften up the dry food  
tavern	 liam gray chicken mcnuggets  matt itll soften up a lot of things its pretty terrifying  laura itll make the wolf vomit  travis so i throw that on the ground and i pour a little ale on top of it  laughter  sam wolves love getting drunk  matt very good it leans forward and smells it  travis yeah no it wasnt the best i can do better okay  laura trinket goes up and starts eating it  travis hes going to barf that all over the carpet later  liam forget the chocolate  
none	 travis i need to carry beef in this bitch  taliesin it goes bad  liam we have dork weve got nothing of dork left  laura oh you know what i have by the way i still have like a cooler bag of holding that we  got from the slayers take  travis oh thats really good to know  travis i pour into a little chalice some ale  laura like it keeps things cold yeah its like a little bitty one but it keeps parts from going bad  matt its nowhere near as large as 
town	 a bag of holding but it has a slow stasis for organic goods  sam we should keep some food on hand next time  laura totally  travis i offer him some ale just to see if he even likes it some dogs like beer some others dont  matt mm wolf doesnt seem to be interested  travis yeah all right then i chug it  sam so are we telling this wolf something or commanding it to come with us as we return to town  taliesin i think he would be helpful to guard the town 
town	 at this point  laura well hell follow grog i suppose  sam lets go back to town and bring him with us  travis all right  matt you guys return to whitestone its another like threehour trek to find your way back down  to the city stalks up next to you definitely seems to be attentive to your commands doesnt  appear to be a bond per se but of everyone that its encountered so far youre the only one that  really gathered its respect  laura i threw a treat at it i dont understand 
town	  travis thats a great thing to throw at a giant 400pound bull mastiff  marisha i spoke words at it apparently thats not good enough communicating  travis right so were walking back to town weve got a giant fuckoff wolf with us  vax looks like edward scissorhands  liam im peeling that off as we walk  laura and travis what  travis no  laura leave it the fuck on  liam im peeling it off  laura its really expensive what do you want to damage it  liam im peeling it off  laura 
town	 quietly fuck he doesnt appreciate presents  matt all right so you take what little bit of the armor you had on off and are you putting  your other armor back on  laura he doesnt have any other armor i took his armor  liam i have regular fucking armor that i grew up in with you you fucking shit  sam do you want to trade with me vax ive got some armor you could take  travis yeah  liam youre a funny man  matt all right so youre back in town and you have 
town	 a wolf  travis do we find a holding pen for the wolf  taliesin i dont think we need to i think we can communicate to him  laura no tell him not to attack villagers  taliesin ask him if hell be willing to keep the town safe  laura do it in a really aggressive way though keyleth stern  marisha very aggressive okay okay  sam we should find some food for the thing too  marisha if i turned into a dog if i turned into a wolf do you think hed respect me more 
none	  laura no hell probably attack you  travis hell mount you  laura or hell bone you  taliesin im not ready for that game  sam do it  travis lets be clear  laughter  laura matts like mmmm  liam oh you soured the dm  laughter  taliesin to be fair thats happened before  laura yeah i remember  taliesin with the troll  travis with the troll it was so good that was you wasnt it  taliesin no it wasnt me was it you  sam i dont know  travis who 
none	 was getting humped on  taliesin i dont remember  sam finalize this wolf so we can go kill something  marisha i take my staff and i say galdric im being assertive  liam yes  sam shes the alpha  laura whispering grog go stand behind her  marisha you want a task ill give you one  matt all right how long does speak with  marisha i dont know  matt it lasts for ten minutes so you can cast it again its first level  marisha oh has it not been ten minutes  matt 
none	 it has been more than ten minutes it took you three hours to return  marisha okay we walked back okay ill cast it again  matt all righty  marisha can i cast speak with animals on other people i cant right no  matt all right so as you shout go ahead and make an animal handling check with advantage  because of your ability to speak  marisha with advantage  matt yes  marisha ill take the what is that 16 plus a six so 22  matt okay galdric turns to you and essentially leans 
none	 towards you and you get the essence the  idea of a message across and to keep me from having to walk behind now at this point as you  guys have managed to make seeming amends at the moment employs the idea of  ill listen if you give me a task  marisha he talked back  laura have him guard the village  marisha okay louder galdric only a beast of your great fortitude  laura just fucking tell him to do it  marisha right okay sorry would you like to guard  sam its a 
town	 command  marisha  the town whitestone shouting guard this town dog  travis keyleth repeat after me  marisha yes  travis in exchange for food protect these lands  marisha galdric in exchange for food shelter and a cozy fire every once in awhile  travis i didnt say that shit i didnt say that hes a wolf he doesnt need those  marisha patrol these lands  laura protect these lands  marisha protect these lands  travis quietly holy shit  matt for how long  laura laughs he already asked that  marisha why does 
none	 he want details why does the dog want  laura as long as we need you to  travis no no a great danger approaches  taliesin until the danger has passed  travis youll know it when it comes  marisha clears throat a great danger  laura approaches  marisha approaches a great danger approaches your service is required until that danger  taliesin has passed  marisha has passed is no longer in effect youll know youll know because theyre fucking  dragons man youll know protect  travis i walk over and put my hand over 
tavern	 keyleths mouth you stay we feed you is there a tavern or  a butcher shop or something nearby  matt there is a butcher as youre having this thought however galdric turns back over to you  and says i can feed myself  laura yeah you can  matt but i will watch until this danger has passed  laura awesome  matt then am i free to go  marisha then you are free to go  matt very well i grow tired of service i wait too long and the wolf looks at you gives you 
none	  like an acknowledgement and then walks off into the woods  laura bye buddy  marisha thanks galdric appreciate it man  laura man thats a coollooking wolf  marisha i look at grog how was that did that sound okay  travis that was the dumbest thing ive ever heard  laughter  taliesin you did good you did good  sam i thought she did very well  marisha thank you it really liked you you should learn how to talk to animals  laura what is that what is that you have what is that  
none	 taliesin im holding onto the ravens slumber jewel at the moment  sam the thing that can capture evil  taliesin its empty now and do you know what i bet would fit in it very nicely  travis me  laura and we can carry him around and then pop him out wait okay wait is it going to hurt  him does it hurt him is it like its bad  sam not only does it not hurt him he does not age or feel any pain  travis a willing creature need not make a saving throw 
none	  taliesin its automatic and no time passes  laura okay im going to try it and im going to try it and just to see how he likes it if hes  okay with it  matt okay  laura hey buddy come here  matt as you turn around and look you see theres a small puddle on the ground where trinket has  vomited up hes pushing dirt over it  travis yeah you got to teach him to quit rummaging that is really foul  laura what was that trinket what did you eat dont eat 
none	 the puke do not eat the puke  come here  matt trinkets like scraping dirt over it  travis got a carrot on your chin  laura trinket do you want to go for a ride you like rides yeah you want to go for one all  right sit still thisll be fun i dont know how to use it  taliesin just point yep  laura i point to him with the  sam you should probably say something cool  laura by the power vested in me i now pronounce you my pokemon  laughter  
dung	 matt words be damned it takes you an action or so to activate the crystal but as you do trinket  gives a confused look before trinkets shadow seems to crawl up his legs until it forms into  this circle this dark core roughly half the size of trinkets form before it  shoots into the crystal  laura is he about this size but i dont like that one is he about this size  matt a little larger than that before he goes into the crystal but once hes in the crystal  its small  laura 
dung	 oh its a little crystal  liam trinkachu i choose you  laura gasps oh my gosh thats really fun okay how do i let him go  marisha i think you yeah  laura i release you  matt okay as you do that once again the same dark energy you saw earlier spills out and hits  the ground in front of you and from that dark shadow area trinkets form emerges standing there  looking really confused  laura how was it did it hurt can you talk to him you can still talk to him talk 
none	 to him ask  him if it hurt  matt vomiting noises vomits a little bit more on the ground  laura well thats not good  marisha you know sometimes the teleportation makes you lose your lunch  laura ask him how hes doing  marisha trinket you all right buddy you all right there  matt feeling sick  laura ask him how the little car ride was ask him if he liked the ride  marisha how was the ride did you feel all right how was  matt yeah  laura okay would you mind ask 
none	 him if hed mind doing that on occasion you know whenever  i need him to  marisha what was it like in there was it  matt i dont remember  marisha okay thats good thats good would you mind  laura ask him if he cares if i do it again ask him if he cares  marisha would you mind doing that you know frequently on occasion  matt if she wants me to okay  laura what did he say what did he say he looked really cute when he said something  marisha you have 
none	 a lot of men who will do anything for you  laura oh buddy i go and hug him really tight and scratch his ears  matt you do and avoid the little bit of  laura vomit on i dont even care oh my gosh thank you this is the best this is the best and  we can travel with him we can climb with him we can sneak around  sam hey and if trinket isnt in it you can also use it to capture baddies  laura i know its great  taliesin and because of 
none	 the way that the projection works you could also in theory capture  a baddie and then let them loose off a cliff and watch them drop  laura oh my god  marisha oh my god youre right  taliesin its very convenient  laura oh my gosh okay  matt so you have a crystal youve set a wolf on a path  sam where are we going next  matt where are you going now  taliesin your home i imagine  laura dont we need tooh yeah  sam whats our todo list  marisha we 
none	 dont have to worry about it we can its fine  taliesin fire ashari it is  sam wait wait wait what are the things that we need to do  laura we need to check in on keyleths family  sam cobalt reserve ashari  laura grogs family  sam did we already take care of osysas mate frostweald  laura no but thats down  taliesin thats far  marisha thats the other vestige correct  laura yes thats over by grogs family  matt thats information about the vestiges  sam we need to steal an airship 
none	  taliesin i agree thats still very important  travis i cant remember where what  laura they were by kraghammer  travis thank you im having terrible hiccups  sam what about we need to find kaylie at some point we also need to whos gone wheres  allu wheres ki wheres people  laura allura should be here in like a day she should be here very soon  travis whats close to here hiccups  taliesin nothings close were specifically far away from everything  marisha but we can go wherever we want as long as weve 
none	 been there before  travis well we should definitely go to the fire ashari  taliesin fire ashari is the next  laura we should go to the fire ashari  marisha oh god im immediately nauseous  matt bear noises  liam thats two of us  marisha oh trinket buddy what time is it  laura laughs do you need some water  matt its still with the travel to and from its middle afternoon like one oclock in the  afternoon  taliesin take it  sam if were going to go do we need anything before 
none	 we leave we got everything we need  potions and stuff want to buy some meat for your cooler  laura yeah lets get some meat  matt its pretty easy to go ahead and procure it five gold of meat will fill that thing  laura yeah  matt so go ahead and mark five gold off your paper  sam how much could i buy a medical kit somewhere  matt yeah you could find a general store and purchase a medical kit  sam how much is that  matt im going to look that up right 
none	 now  sam all right whatever ive got it  taliesin its nifty that you have a book that tells you how much something like that costs  matt imagine that its like its a handbook of some kind its crazy  marisha does anyone have any fireresistant items  laura he does  liam i do  laura put it on  marisha i might pick up some fire resistant potions as well  travis i have this black iron plate that i havent used ever while wearing this heavy plate  armor the bearer gains resistance to any 
none	 fire damage  matt five gold for an herbalists kit for you  laura oh plate armor none of us can wear it but pike  matt an herbalists kit like five gold  sam can that stabilize people  matt if used with a medicine check yeah  laura okay i have this which i cant wear  taliesin what is that  laura its a purple and black robe it was lady briarwoods robes  taliesin what does it do  laura clings to nearby darkness as you walk while wearing this robe you gain resistance to  
none	 piercing damage anybody need pierce resistance that can wear robes  taliesin im pretty reasonable  sam do i wear robes  matt robes would be worn instead of your armor  sam no thanks  laura what about gloves of missile snaring that appeal to anyone  sam missile snaring what does that do  laura these gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them and when a ranged weapon  attack hits you you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 plus your dexterity  modifier provided that you have a 
none	 free hand if you reduce the damage to zero you can catch the  missile if its small enough to hold in that hand  taliesin does it require attuning  marisha theyre pretty sleek  laura it requires two no it just requires one free hand  taliesin yes but does it require attuning  laura yes it does it requires attuning  taliesin i might be attuned out at this point  laura anybody i feel like that could be cool for you scanlan  sam i think i can take it  taliesin whats your dex your 
none	 dexterity is not very actually it might work out well for me  weirdly enough  marisha are you fully attuned  taliesin i can undo something that im not using  marisha percy you have access here in whitestone to alchemy supplies correct  taliesin matt i have access to alchemy supplies here in whitestone correct  matt laughs i mean there are elements of your initial workshop i guess that a lot of supplies  have been cannibalized but a few things can be pieced together plus there was a lot of  alchemical elements and tools that 
none	 were utilized in the subterranean tunnels as part of the  refinement process for the whitestone residuum the large vats of acid that were distilled by the  briarwoods while they were here and there are other elements of their own tinkering in the  alchemical arts that remain scattered throughout the castle so yeah you can definitely find  enough to tinker with if you want  marisha i mean we could take the rest of the evening and i can attempt to make some fire  resist potions  sam eh  travis all right heres what im 
none	 thinking right i mean if we go after my herd were in  for a fight a big one if we go to your fire ashari were doing recon and hopefully learning  something right  marisha well were going to be in for a fight at the fire ashari as well because theres a giant  sunder in the fire plane and last time i checked there were fire imps and elementals pouring  through there  travis are those bad  taliesin eh  marisha theyre annoying  taliesin as long as were quick we can go about 
none	 it  marisha well  sam whats our mission  travis you really want to get the rest of the testicles of  marisha i mean we could theoretically see if there are survivors and i can attempt to close the tear in  the plane i dont know if i can do that however i dont know anyone else particularly more  qualified to attempt it  travis allura or that bearded dude  marisha were talking about the fire ashari and possibly what to do there  laura oh  marisha we can go and look for survivors 
none	  laura and bring them here  marisha and someone should probably close the tear in the fire plane  laura should we wait for allura then before we go  travis well if there are survivors they might not be that way for very long if we dont go  laura theyve been there for a while already  marisha if there are survivors  laura then theyre surviving  marisha theyve survived i agree its not going to be pretty  taliesin i know you dont want to go  marisha i really dont  taliesin but we 
none	 need to go i say we take the rest of the day you make your potions we leave  first thing in the morning  laura wait for allura hopefully shell be here by then  taliesin maybe allura will join us by tomorrow morning if not we teleport over  matt okay you guys are going to rest for the evening  travis wait hold on is there like a house of entertainment in whitestone i know its just  getting back on its feet but you know  matt that would be a question more for percival  
none	 travis percy im having a bit of a soul struggle and im wondering if i might bend  your ear for a moment  taliesin sure  travis yeah could i speak to you over here  taliesin yes of course  travis right so like i want to get my freak on  taliesin i dont feel that way about you  laughter  travis yeah no i im sorry  taliesin i mean youre very attractive  travis that was very unclear so i know this is like your home and stuff and you might not have

town	 fiery entities are pouring through  taliesin its a hellmouth its basically a hellmouth  travis its either that or we go goliath hunting  laura thats next  taliesin but this is quick this is something that we can knock off the list  sam all right lets knock it off  travis yeah right lets just check it off  liam as were walking through town do i see any weaponsmiths  matt make an investigation check  liam okay  taliesin ill help you make the potions  liam 21  matt okay thatll help cut down 
town	 on the time 21 there are two functional smiths left in the town  there were two more than that overall that were more like blacksmithy but they both unfortunately  lost their lives in the insurrection but there are two functional blacksmiths in this yeah  liam and ones nearby to pass through  matt about a tenminute diversion  liam im splitting off from the group  matt okay  sam weve got to get out of here  liam ones in front of me now  matt well you find your way to its a small blacksmith 
none	 and most of its outside though the  day is growing late you do see an older gentleman long tattered grey hair pulled into a  very tight bun in the back and a beard that is actually tied off to the side otherwise it would  be hanging down into his work hes wearing sootcovered clothes big leather apron leather  gloves and hes currently in the process of ping ping turning over and hammering out a piece of  orange glowing steel  liam excuse me sorry to interrupt i have a very simple request  matt he 
none	 doesnt stop he seems to he acknowledges your presence but hes still working  as hes listening smithing sounds  liam i have six gold burning a hole in my pocket im not looking for anything simple do you have a  short sword a regular old shortsword  matt ting he looks over at you if thats what youre looking for on that wall over there weve  got two shortswords ting  liam whats the difference between the two that i can see  matt smithing sounds that you can see make a perception check  liam 22 
none	  matt looking over them both from this distance theyre both made with different hilt designs and  different pommel designs the grips are a little different but other than that the blades are  pretty much identical  liam i grab one off the wall i slap down six gold which i know is way too much and say thank  you sir pelor lives here and i walk away  matt okay as you start walking away he goes hey  liam yeah  matt youre going to pay proper for that shortsword  liam oh im sorry 
town	 how much does it cost  matt 12 gold pieces  liam my apologies 12  matt 12 gold pieces friend  liam so i put down six i put down another 14 i really apologize i was just confused  matt its all right no harm no foul takes the gold and scoops it and puts it into his pouch  have a good day  liam i walk down the street going like its big  matt its much bigger than youre used to but its got a fine balance to it and its wellmade  all right 
none	 so as you guys have all  laura ive got an opal dagger you could have used  liam i dont need your dagger  taliesin were going to make our potions  matt yes yes all right so  marisha i have another question  matt what is your other question  marisha before we all go to bed tonight can we get like a fuckton of the green stone under  whitestone  taliesin theres really not a lot of it  marisha say like 1000 worth and maybe have like a real nice heroes feast before tomorrow 
dung	  liam wise as fuck  laura or in the morning  liam heroes breakfast  marisha ive got to do it at night because i have to tree stride in the morning  matt you can choose either to create the potion or to mine the residuum for the evening you  cannot do both both are time like to pull that material from the because most of it that  remains has been already embedded within the ziggurat beneath you would actually have to  physically chip it from the structure  laura i have a plan keyleth 
dung	  marisha yes  laura we will cover the 1000 gold from our own party funds and have someone here mine some shit  for us and give it to us later  marisha i like that plan yeah sounds good to me  sam how about the wolf  taliesin so potions  laura percival do you have people here who can mine looking for work people  marisha yeah sure why not  taliesin ill let them know that they should start trying to pull the residuum out of the wall  but its dangerous down there  
none	 laura yeah it is  taliesin and tampering with it is definitely  travis necessary  taliesin should be ginger it would im trying to keep everything ginger down there  laura so maybe we should take 1000 gold just from your family stores then huh that might be  smarter  taliesin we currently have 1000 gold from my family stores that are in the group treasury at  the moment  laura oh we do no thats 500 that was just 500 just so you know  taliesin i feel like it was more than that  laura 
none	 no it was just 500  liam hey de rolo do you remember what happened yesterday  taliesin hes not there  laura isnt he though  taliesin i was going to do such a nice thing for you but never mind now  laura laughs no no no do something really nice for me  liam where did i go oh i went to buy a shortsword  taliesin no never mind you went to buy a shortsword  laura dear dear dear im sorry im sorry im sorry do nice things all right  taliesin im trying to 
none	 be gentle with my family right now theyre taking on an awful lot  laura youre right theyre taking on so many people  taliesin and well see what we can do  liam id like to think you hear me in your mind  taliesin always fucking hear you in my mind  laura lets just use the damned party funds for the time being its fine keyleth this is a really  important feast  taliesin were busy making potions  laura all right  matt so you prepare a heroes feast before you begin this potioncreation process 
none	 is that what i  understand or not  laura what  marisha can i make some potions and then like i make dinner for us before we go to bed  matt its going to take you about the length of a day to create the potion with his help it takes  it to about half so itll be about 12 hours of creating eight to 12 hours so  travis pick one  taliesin pick one  marisha ill do a damn feast  taliesin no potion  matt you can do the potion as well the 
none	 feast only takes a moment to cast  marisha all right okay yeah  matt im just saying be aware that you guys will probably have if you want to get a full rest  after that potion creation process youre going to have to wait until like this time tomorrow  like late in the day to make your journey which is fine if youre willing to be patient about it  travis sure  matt yes no  travis say one just say one  marisha yeah lets do it lets do it lets go in prepared and 
none	 then we can always rest on that side  matt cool for a fine fine dinner  laura just want to make sure we feast right before we leave so that its most useful  matt all right so you everyone else goes to sleep while you and percy work tirelessly through  the night if i could have you  liam fuck  matt laughs just for the sake of it i want you to go ahead and make an arcana check  marisha aw an arcana do i get advantage because of my little skill in alchemy im 
none	 skilled in  alchemy  matt yeah oh thats right you are never mind go ahead and do that  matt proficiency bonus are you proficient in alchemy  marisha yeah  matt so proficiency bonus and for this use intellect modifier  marisha okay intellect which makes it plus seven do i have advan ooh i rolled a natural 19  matt okay well say for the fair cost of reduced due to the roll 450 gold pieces you  create a potion of resistance of your choice of resistance  marisha just one  matt just one  
none	 marisha fire  matt it takes a long time man  marisha fire  matt fire all right you create a potion of fire resistance the materials cost you 450 gold to  create you finish it by about sunrise the next day everyone else begins slowly waking up after  the nights rest as you guys both bags under your eyes  laura oh that was a good nights sleep i tell you what  travis seriously  sam keyleth could you  marisha what oh god you snuck up on me  sam could you make me some 
none	 tea real quick  marisha scanlan  sam what  marisha go fuck yourself  sam what you were up before me i thought  taliesin all right all right this is fine  marisha this is fine  taliesin this is good  marisha this is great  matt youre doing a heroes feast for breakfast then is that how its working  marisha ill take a nap ill cook breakfast guys good morning good morning  laura oh hey good morning keyleth  sam why dont you sleep during the day well all take our feast and then 
none	 blast off at night time  marisha because i have to teleport and cooking this feast are both 6thlevel spells and i can  only do one of those a day  travis man its hard being a druid  laura can anybody else make a feast thats here  marisha pike pike pike  sam shes with gilmore  travis shes not here  laura sighs i miss pike  liam we all miss pike  marisha ill cook breakfast guys  laura no ill cook breakfast no i wont cook breakfast  liam thats a good idea for 
none	 you to not cook breakfast  matt whats the plan  marisha im cooking breakfast  matt are you cooking breakfast or are you summoning breakfast thats my question  laura are you summoning breakfast and then youre sleeping and then were leaving  marisha im summoning yes im summoning breakfast and then im sleeping  laura and then youre sleeping and then were leaving as soon as you wake up  matt okay thats what i was wondering we got the answer okay cool hoo todays been a slog  all right so you go ahead and you use 
none	 heroes feast summoning forth a fantastical breakfast meal  filled with coffee and eggs and everything you would hope for the finest materials  laura froot loops  matt laughs sure froot loops is on the menu why not  taliesin lucky charms  matt no lucky charms sorry those arent available on taldorei but yes all you guys take  an hour to finish devouring this you finish your meal all you guys get a 2d10 hit point maximum  increase to your hit points  laura ooh ooh greens greens  matt and immune to poison frightened and 
none	 all wisdom saving throws have advantage  travis damn  sam advantage on wisdom  matt yes the usual  travis almost broke  marisha and wisdom  laura and youre immune to fear right  marisha immune to fear poison and what else  matt and you get advantage on wisdom saving throws  sam okay  matt after which percy and keyleth pretty much fall asleep at the table as it vanishes and they  both collapse to the ground eggs out of the corner of their mouth eventually they make  themselves back up to sleep and 
none	 the rest of you guys peter around for the remainder of the day  while they get their full rest it now comes to at the end of that eighthour period of time id  say about three four in the afternoon before they finally wake up youve restored your spells  marisha yay  matt and the rest of you are ready to go about your business  laura lets go lets go lets go  liam wait while theyre sleeping right  matt mmhmm  liam i take scanlan aside  matt okay  sam oi  liam 
none	 hey buddy  sam hey friendo  liam yeah  sam whats up  liam we dont talk a lot  sam well we start to and then you leave the room usually  laughter  liam i dont handle personal emotional confrontation very well  sam its okay i walk away  laughter  marisha oh shit  sam then i come back i feel bad  taliesin no no that was perfect  liam where did you go  sam just kidding just kidding  liam pull up a chair sit down i want to ask you something 
none	  sam im already as low as i can go  liam youre right how do you do it  sam how do i do what  liam how do you do it youre risking your life as much as anyone in this group youre almost  dying every day youre fucking smiling all the time how do you do it im kind of asking as liam  to sam as well but mostly as vax to scanlan how do you do it you almost died yesterday as well  or two days ago fuck why do you do it 
none	  sam well vax i dont know i mean i like you people okay everything before this was not as  good this is better thats why its very simple you had a shitty childhood didnt you  you and the sister  liam yeah  sam i think grog had some troubles weve all had our share of shit before we all met now were  together were a family this is better thats how i smile its better than it was before  thats it  liam were probably going to die in the next month  sam 
tavern	 yes but its fun while it lasts  liam all right thought i might  sam glean some wisdom  liam yeah but im just as confused as before  sam listen im older than you  liam how much older  sam a bit ive seen more than you have and its all shitty so it just depends on how you look at  it you can dwell on the shit or you can just leave it behind in peoples beds and keep going  marisha oh god that works on too many levels  taliesin oh god thats 
town	 too deep  marisha too deep  liam you did that water under the bridge  sam i walk away  liam that little motherfucker shit in my bed  matt all right as you regather your will path chosen keyleth do you wish to prepare the  transportation spell  marisha yeah  taliesin lets do this  matt all right all of you gather and find your way down to the sun tree in the center of the  town at this point its later afternoon youve been growing accustomed these past few days of  taking action 
none	 right around dusk and as the sky turns from a blue to a bit of an orangish hue you  all find yourselves ready to transition back over to the continent of issylra  marisha lets go to the sun tree  matt keyleth steps forward touches her hand to the sun tree completes her mental incantation  and you watch the trunk once again tear open into the somewhat oval walkway into the tree itself on  the opposite side whats your destination  marisha oh god as close as i can get to the fire ashari i guess 
dung	  matt okay you recall passing through there were a number of trees towards the base of the  mountain that were starting to grow petrified from the proximity to the ash that constantly falls  from the sky they died a long time ago and are slowly beginning to petrify as the portal opens  up on the opposite side you can see beyond that the dark rock that formulates that mountain range  at the same time you can see a dull orange glow and you all begin to step through in rapid  succession trinket racing up 
dung	 after vex all of you find yourself stepping out the other side at  which point you look up and you can see the pathway that you took towards the top of the  mountain where the fire ashari called pyrah where they maintained their evervigilant watch on the  tear into the fire elemental plane what you do notice immediately is that the path that you took  initially is no longer a simple walkway against the now very dark sky this side of the realm  itself night is actually no sorry at this point youve actually beaten 
dung	 the sun  marisha oh do we gain a few hours  matt yeah you guys have gained a few hours technically  marisha awesome  matt so its still light in the sky from other parts in the distance however there is a  perpetual dark cloud of smoke and actual storm cloud gathering across this mountain range as you  recall the first time you were here thats the nature of pyrah its always under this thick  heavy sootandashfilled cloud cover the pathway that winds up the mountain though is  instead a glowing orange mass of 
dung	 slowly dribbling molten rock that has filled that entire walkway  and it has come to rest at the base of the mountain where it has gathered and begun to cool  you guys are hundreds of feet off from this point as you step out of the tree however where you  see the molten rock has reached the base of the mountain you its cooled and formed into solid  rock at its base and you start seeing flashes of the orange turning dark then another section  turns dark from the opposite side and then a few 
dung	 moments pass and you can see the orange of the  next section up in like tenfoot segments its going dark and hardening on its own you get the  sense that your arrival did not trigger this more than it has been happening since  before you arrived  marisha can i do a nature check to figure out whats up  matt sure actually this would be a perception check to see if you can ascertain  marisha 16  matt 16 its difficult to make out at this distance but you can see along portions of the 
none	  jagged mountainside a collection of small figures that are making their way up the mountain and  their slow ascent is met with the lava flow cooling in sections  marisha do they look like people like humanoids  matt its hard to tell from this distance they look humanish humanoidish  taliesin i attempt to use the optics on my gun to get a better look at them  matt sure go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin 18  matt 18 a little bit of a clearer look through they do appear to be humanoid 
none	 you do see two  arms two legs you cant gauge size comparison from this distance  sam how far  matt at this point theyre probably a good 800 feet up the mountain  marisha 800 feet  taliesin are they dressed like the ashari that ive met  matt from what you can make out their color palette shifts there are reds and browns some  stand out as an aquamarine white the ashari you saw were a pretty consistent color palette this  is a little more varied  taliesin i dont know who these people are 
none	  marisha they could still be ashari just in their elemental forms are there any birds around i  look up do i see birds in the sky  matt there are no birds in the sky unfortunately because of the nature of this area  especially as the oppressive fumes and dust continue to pour off from the top of the caldera  of this mountain range it has made it not fitting for any sort of aerial life that youre used to  seeing you glance around for about a minute or two and you dont see any 
none	 sort of bird life in the air  travis did the ground cool where they were walking could we follow them up  taliesin we should  marisha lets stay far behind lets go quietly  laura lets walk stealth i cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt okay everyone make a stealth check including trinket  travis you dont want to put him in the thing  sam you could  laura gasps okay  liam try it out  laura i put it on a string so i could put it around my neck 
none	 because its a necklace because  its cooler that way  matt well it has a chain on it that it came with  laura its got a chain on it so its around my neck  matt all right so you take it you put  sam it has a chain and a string now  matt chain and string  marisha the strings so you dont forget  matt exactly you trigger the necklace pointing it in the direction of trinket and once again  trinket is absorbed into the crystal vanishing within the inside all right  
none	 travis 17  matt 17  sam pass without a trace is  travis plus ten i rolled shitty  laura 30  liam 35  marisha 32  taliesin 29  sam 25  matt okay you guys begin making your trek up how are you going up the mountain are you scaling  the cooled flow  marisha and travis yeah  matt thats probably the safest route given the fact that most of the other side of the mountain  range itself is pretty jagged and elements of it because of the formation of this giant volcanic 
none	  caldera there are portions of broken stone and obsidian glass that sticks out the side  marisha as were walking up i fall behind and i slip vax the potion of fire protection  matt all right you guys continue in pace with this eventually and make  another perception check  marisha much better thats a natural 19 30  matt 30 okay looking up as this cluster of individuals makes their way towards the very top  of the mountain seemingly not taking sight of your traveling group youre beginning to see the  nature of each 
none	 section of this flow cooling and what youre seeing is the group will move up a  bit stop and there appears to be a burst of sometimes it looks like very strong wind sometimes  it looks like a very localized sleet storm that is brought against the side of the mountain and is  actually forcefully cooling the flow down temporarily at least in those sections before it  begins to spill over and continue its slow molten descent but theyre doing their best to continue  to force it back up the mountain and  laura and 
none	 marisha those are druids  marisha i cast skywrite in the clouds above us in the smoke  matt okay  marisha and i write  laura so how are you guys doing up there  taliesin hi  marisha hi hey you guys i write in druidic symbols keyleth kaitiaki  sam whats that is that her  matt okay you notice the pace in which this group has ascended comes to a halt at the very  very top of the mountain range where it ends and theres a slight pause before the clouds shift a  second 
none	 time and it says from what you understand kaitiaki survivors remain keyleth  marisha and i respond with help has arrived  sam you guys are texting  marisha laughs yeah  matt druid texting  laura what are you saying  taliesin stop looking at your phone  laura what do they say  sam why dont we go over there and talk to them  marisha theyre survivors  travis well lets go  laura are they nice  marisha theyre survivors what does it matter  travis and we go  marisha lets go and i tell 
none	 them you know arriving stand down here we come  taliesin lol  marisha lol winkyface  liam as we travel because i was too out of it to respond and shes way ahead i take the potion  that keyleth gave to me because she didnt have to ive got the david bowie armor on now  matt you did don it okay  liam yes yeah before going to bed  marisha oh you did okay  liam and i press it into vexs hand  matt okay  laura hey i took your all right im going 
none	 to take it  matt what was your choice of resistance i assume it was fire okay all right as you guys progress  up and it is though it is a safe route it is still a relatively steep incline and youre all  having to work together to find handholds and it is very arduous physically getting up there i  would like everyone to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw  sam oh shit  laura a constitution  matt yes  laura oh do we get advantage because of the feast  travis no 
none	 thats only wisdom  laura shit  liam come on colville meteorite die  travis 17  liam im so weak  laura come on jade  liam natural 20  laura you motherfucker  liam thank you matthew colville  laura im rolling my giant jade dice because its green  travis way to announce it  laura wompwomp oh thats a six  travis laughs youre fucked  marisha 20  taliesin 13  sam five  matt okay as you guys begin to get partially up the mountain the proximity of the heat from the  because 
none	 the exterior of the rock has cooled but its still molten beneath and there are  parts of that are still cracking open and bits of the heat are still pouring through plus the  general physical exertion from the notveryhardy physiques of both vex and scanlan you both suffer  one level of exhaustion from the ascent up the side of this mountain  laura oh trinkets in his thing hes not worried at all  taliesin i dont actually know what one level of exhaustion is  matt you guys have disadvantage on ability checks all your skill 
none	 checks right now until  your next long rest are at disadvantage  travis levels of exhaustion suck  sam not saving  matt however as you guys are approaching towards the top you can see now the humanoids that were at  the top of this mountain crest have been since keeping the flow at bay and each time it begins to  crest over again and continue its flow its blasted again from the side and cools and its  building this very very slow gradual outcropping  marisha i use my cantrip gust and cool areas alongside 
none	 as we ascend  matt okay you glance up and you now have a better view of this group and what you do see  ahead of you specifically keyleth appears to be a cluster of about eight or so fire asharidressed  individuals you cant make out their physical details yet along with five other entities that  are dressed in the colors and vestments of those from zephrah  marisha oh shit  travis from who from what  liam whats the matter  laura whats up whats happening  marisha i run up  matt keyleth goes 
none	 running up  marisha you said seven or eight from  zephrah  matt there are five from zephrah  laura are we going to were going to follow  liam yeah im breaking out of stealth and running  taliesin ah yeah no were running now  laura i walk im pretty tired you and me lets just walk  sam yeah you can carry me  taliesin cardio god  matt okay it takes a while to get up there as you guys begin to approach a little bit behind  keyleth and you look you see the 
none	 only two notable fire ashari that you see there are  nastoen which is a human female that you saw was one of the four that first greeted you as you  approached pyrah when you got to the mountaintop she looks a little rough but shes definitely in  one piece the other one that greets you and immediately you recognize as flamespeaker  cerkonos who currently does not have his right arm it is charred and is through some semblance  of flame cauterized to where he no longer has a shoulder and part of his torso is 
none	 a black mass of  burnt skin probably intentionally but as you approach he puts his hand out and goes  hail keyleth  marisha hail cerkonos and i run up and give him a hug  matt he pats you on the back and theres a coldness to his look his expression you can see  in a brief instant though there is strength and determination there is a moment as he looks into  your face that you can see the sorrow of losing most of his people  marisha and i look back at him and i 
none	 say im so sorry  matt this is not your fault we had this coming we are the ablebodied few you see  marisha are these all that have survived  matt we are 25 living the rest reside at the base of the mountain to be watched or are the  watchers but our attrition is of our own making we helped outsiders too long ago  marisha what what do you mean like how long ago 12 15 years  matt we helped seal a drake in this rift  laura thordak  matt that is the name 
none	 they call him we helped bring and bind the beast to this rift sealing  within it the heart of a primordial flame one of the few pure essence crystals of our plane such a  binding will not allow it to leave it is a punishment for the most terrible of evils that the  ashari take under their order we carved from the crystal in bind this beast was too strong and  took the entire crystal but it seemed enough it seemed enough  marisha cerkonos its not your fault there are greater forces at work here 
none	 beyond us thats  something that i am desperately trying to reassure myself of every day  matt and a voice comes up from over the mountain range raspy older and with a casual importance  to it and it says so are you claiming some semblance of dealing with this and as it steps  over the face looks down with recognition my god keyleth  marisha who are you  matt you guys look up and you see long silverhaired halfelf in later years dressed in  the blue and white robes of the air ashari you see 
none	 before you korren your father you live  marisha dad  matt he steps forward and goes in as he steps away from cerkonos takes you in his arms and  holds you extremely tight against him  marisha im sorry i didnt check in sooner i didnt want you to be disappointed  matt shh he puts his finger up to your lips holds you back and looks you over and with a smile  on his face you can see the hardness of his expression fade keyleth youve grown  marisha a lots happened  matt you look 
none	 just like her  marisha i havent found mom  matt her path was her own im just glad that you have maintained yours he wipes the tear from  your face and says how goes the aramente  marisha well  laura shes kicking ass  matt good good and he places his thumb at the corner of his eye we were called naught but a  day ago by the surviving pyrah told of the angry mountain and the terrible drake that sundered the  rift i helmed the team while the majority of our people stayed to 
none	 keep zephrah cloaked and safe  from the marauding beast weve only just made our way up the mountain your arrival is quite  fortuitous as we need all the help we can get  sam how can we be of assistance  matt come see what remains of pyrah he turns around and walks back over towards the top of the  mountain  marisha daddy  matt he stops looks over his shoulder towards you yes  marisha its good to see you again father  matt its good to see you as well daughter now come show 
none	 me what youve learned goes back to  walking the rest of the fire ashari stand up acknowledge and recognize those of you that stand  here before visiting once before cerkonos looks about you show strength and honor by coming here  in our time of need this will not be forgotten now come as you follow them up over the top of  the mountain you see once again before you the caldera of this oncevolcanic mountain has been  blown apart in areas you can see sections of large black stone that are now pushed up into 
none	  jagged obelisks where once was a relatively smooth blackened shale countryside you can see there are  pits of molten rock that have been punched through the floor and have gathered into these pools where  the air above is slowly shifting and warped by the heat that is now released above the mountaintop  the flow of lava that descends down the side of this mountain continues and swells and heads  inward towards the cindergrove the cindergrove from what you can see from this distance is but a  fraction of what was once there most of 
none	 the trees now torn apart and scattered amongst the top of  this mountain you can see bits and pieces of the various petrified trees thrown hundreds of feet  from the center there are still standing defiant trees amongst what once was the cindergrove but  they are very sparse many of them now blackened by what you can see in the very distance beyond  the broken huts and homes that once held the pyrah you can see in the distance moving glowing  dots of various elemental energies spiraling outward from a very large central red rift 
none	 that  sits there pulsing and pulsing with bright almost sunlight energy its like staring into the sun at  the very zenith of its movement you have to avert your eyes even staring towards this rift now a  good 30 40 feet taller than it was when you last returned here what was once the portal in the  ground has now ruptured and is emerging slowly piercing out of the top of this mountain  undaunted your father and the other ashari continue walking forward with no words  laura i rush forward a little bit to 
none	 talk to him question your majesty i want to help we all  want to help as much as possible but i dont know any magic most of us dont are we going to be  able to do anything  matt well i certainly hope so if youve survived this long with my daughter youve picked  up a few tricks  laura well that i have  marisha father i wouldnt be here if it wasnt for these people they are the most capable  that i know  matt this is good because thats who we need 
none	 right now  marisha however since were druids were a little bit more you know geared prepared to  deal with the fire i can cast protection from energy on a couple of these people if you  wouldnt mind maybe grabbing the other two  matt i will do what i can  marisha and i cast protection from fire on percy you have it you have it do you have it  travis well i really dont even know what im going to do here  marisha well its going to protect you from fire  travis okay 
none	  marisha scanlan  sam hit me babe  marisha ill do percy and scanlan father can you  matt its a concentration spell so you can only really have one person going and thats your  concentration  marisha can only have one person going  matt yep  travis well good  marisha i could cast it at higher levels can i cast it at higher levels  travis ill take a mulligan on this one  marisha cant do that with this one fuck  laura do scanlan do scanlan  sam no im fine dont worry 
none	 about me  marisha well im going to cast it on myself for starters because i want it  laura all right  marisha so im going to cast protection from fire on myself  laura what does a potion of fire resistance do  liam halves  laura the same thing  laura and marisha halves all fire damage  laura okay  matt all right as the cluster of you begin stepping deeper into the caldera you begin to  approach the outskirts of the remnants of the pyrah tribes homestead you can see where most of
