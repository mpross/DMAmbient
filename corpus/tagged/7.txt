avoid the server room  sam half the people youve talked about ive never heard of  travis definitely the safest way back to the twitch stage is through the nerdist office sam  you should lead us  sam okay sure which way do i go  travis just right through this long passageway  sam okay im at the tip of the spear ive got my whip im going  /none/ laura im sure theres something heavy that i can grab and use as a weapon in the nerdist office  taliesin yeah make a perception investigation roll  travis can i do the same  taliesin yeah anybody who wants to make perception investigation roll  laura is it just perception  taliesin perception plus investigation which is right below it  travis oh three successes  taliesin that will do  laura oh god i rolled a failure on the red  taliesin whats your hunger level  laura this is the only one  taliesin just the only /none/ one  travis take a red die  taliesin not for one you get distracted going through peoples stuff and youre going to get  left a

lucky charms  liam whats travis doing right now  taliesin he was wandering he went into the corner to elises desk and he found underneath  her desk something that will do its a replica knife that seems to be pretty solid its a lord  of the rings /none/ replica elf knife its not exactly sharp but it will do the trick  liam i catch up put my hand on your shoulder that is sick and im sorry and i

/none/ a intelligence versus willpower roll  travis so whats the versus mean  taliesin oh just intelligence and willpower  liam a single d10 or so i roll too charisma plus persuasion  taliesin yeah you roll that charisma plus persuasion im making this a versus because  normally its not but this is weird  travis so this is the intelligence one and thats two successes and the willpower is two  successes and a failure but not a red  liam two successes  taliesin two success do you want to burn a willpower to reroll  liam /none/ yes  taliesin reroll everything you dont like and burn a willpower  travis its four successes  liam five successes  sam oh you got to mark off that willpower  taliesin hes your bro man and also take an extra die youre here to keep everybody safe but youre

doesnt really work none of the laptops worked you were playing with nothing  laura im crazy  taliesin so yeah you get to the stage again and big red letters that says i was born in a box  how do i end  travis okay this is obviously some sort of puzzle right  sam this is a riddle this is a puzzle weve got three clues so far i was born in a box how do i end  liam well matt ended and marisha ended  sam something is wrong right that was the first /none/ thing that we read  laura hey guys thanks for leaving me behind in the nerdist  sam is it something is the matter or something is wrong  travis

intelligence test no just sam  sam okay in just a straight  taliesin straight intelligence test  sam straight stanima  taliesin no straight intelligence test you fucker i have your /none/ stats here

box  laura we did coffins dude  travis /none/ testtube babies  taliesin they were born from a tube sorry  sam was jesus christ born in a box a manger thing  laura no we were born in a box  taliesin how much you overestimate me  travis when she stood in the sun did anything happen  taliesin no  travis why dont you take the stake that we were given and stab the heart with it  laura okay i take the wooden stake and stab the heart on the ground  taliesin when you put the stake on the ground by the heart theres /none/ this low bassy thud  laura should i leave it here or should i back up what should i do  sam thats a good thing no this is progress  laura should i leave it on the ground or should i  sam sure  laura ill leave the stake on the ground  taliesin the blood that the heart was drawn with start to turn black and crackle and it boils  there gently  travis okay so heart and stake not cohesive  laura very cohesive it killed the heart  travis and laura yeah  laura /none/ are there any more clues around do we see any more writing  taliesin this is a big building  travis thats true  liam all right theres no people out here right the drink me and eat me people were all  back in the nerdist offices outside the bullpen  taliesin you dont see anybody  travis should we check the little prop closet  laura lets see if the key card opens the prop closet did it work  taliesin the keycard does in fact open the prop closet its a very good keycard thats better  /none/ than my keycard yeah the prop closet opens  laura gasps is there a weapon in here  travis can we turn the light on  taliesin you can hit the switch  travis i hit the switch  taliesin doesnt turn on to be fair you can see okay you dont see  travis i do have heightened senses  taliesin especially if you want to burn a little blood you can see really well if youre looking  for something in particular but its the prop closet its a ruined dishevelled mess of  ephemera toys prop weapons /none/ costumes its exactly the way you remember it  travis do i smell anything coming from this room  taliesin yes but it is the same smell its always had which has been very iffy  travis nothing tasty or spicy or interesting i mean spicy is the wrong word its always spicy  in there  taliesin i dont know its whatever you really imagine the wonderful  travis does it smell delicious  taliesin theres obviously

you bite it  laura three successes for me  taliesin im personally a fan of the taste of rubber rats i think its nice and the textures  pretty positive but your tooth gets a little weird it doesnt feel right  laura three successes  taliesin three successes ooh thats pretty solid you do in fact find a rat hiding behind one  of the costume bins and if you want to tear for it you got to give me a dex melee or dex brawl roll  for it /none/  laura ill do a dex brawl  taliesin all right punch that rat where are you guys going  liam im back at the office outside the bullpen where the door was shut who

she says chris we need you to  help update the server come on and then she walks by carrying the bleeding chris over to the  server room  laura what were you going to say sam  sam im was going to say im feeling very vulnerable why dont we form an alliance and if  anything goes down we kick liam down and well run away as fast as we can  laura but well also make sure  taliesin /none/ sam do you no im just waving this  liam you also have no idea that i just drained chris neck  laura well make sure travis is okay  sam of course yes but liams a goner  laura i mean hes a pretty fast runner im

there were right here i know youre not  watching /none/ marisha i knew where they were you found some prop stakes but to be fair a prop  stake is still a piece of wood thats still stakey  laura how many stakes  taliesin you found two stakes and you found a very weird silver chalice its  interestinglooking could be something could be nothing no idea  laura i stick that in my belt like i would at a ren faire  taliesin renfaire style  laura yeah did i find a world of warcraft weapon too  talisin yeah its a big ridiculous sword that would hang /none/ on a wall  laura whoa is it made of metal  taliesin its made out of a metal  laura this is way too heavy for me  taliesin actually whats your strength  laura two  taliesin thats pretty good thats a 110 pound thats a normal human youre not quite  supernatural but you could be fine with it  laura yeah  travis so liam and i make our way out are we sharing with the others what just happened  laura and sam what just happened  liam thats a bad idea  laura what /none/ was it  travis we canvassed the offices and found  liam well we wanted to find more weapons  travis yeah i found this dagger its not super sharp but  sam i found a sword  liam i got a bunch of pencils  laura look at this bigass sword i found do you want to switch me  liam maybe other people are vampires like us  laura ill take the dagger and you take the giant sword  travis yeah  laura okay all right  taliesin its a good dagger its the scurled one its /none/ got the nice little  laura this is really badass  liam my internal monologue right now is really pissed off that i did not get to taste arcade  taliesin i know you know theres still time things can still get weird well see  travis did you find anything out about the puzzle  laura oh shit i forgot we were trying to solve a puzzle  sam why dont we all look for puzzle clues or should we try to do more to the that circle on  the ground taliesin how big is it  taliesin /none/ its slightly smaller than a childrens foursquare court  sam big enough that if it opened we could fit through it  taliesin its bled up into the door it feels like its some sort of seal against the door  itself  travis ooh wait a minute mercer died by the sun right dont we have his ashes in the power  rangers helmet i pour the ashes of mercer onto the sun square  taliesin thats really fascinating the ashes start to mix with cant believe you did that so  frustrated the ashes start to mix with /none/ the sun symbol and it starts to boil  laura wait marisha died by mushrooms  sam we could put some mushrooms on the head  taliesin well you didnt bring any of the mushrooms because they looked a little  laura he probably still has some on his skin  taliesin he doesnt he wiped them off  sam what would heads not like wait suns cause ashes  laura silver do we have any silver  sam we just found a sword what if the sword is  travis silver chalice you have the silver chalice  laura /none/ oh shit  travis holy fuck take notes  laura i did i had silver chalice written down i thought i could drink out of it  sam but would silver hurt a head  laura well you could hit it  travis plus matt keys head was in the office  laura silver is bad for vamp does this hurt to hold  travis i dont see any other clear connections how about we continue reconning the bottom of this  floor so whos going to take the audio booth  sam theres an audio booth here  laura /none/ yeah its right over in the corner over there dude  sam really  liam yeah you just come from your car right to this table so theres a whole bunch of areas you dont  know about  laura im going to go in the back offices  travis you go in the very back ill take the audio booth who wants the three bathrooms  sam i know where the bathrooms are  taliesin my god weve finally found a part of  travis what are you going to go  liam ill go with sam because we /none/ got to stick together  sam always  travis im the closest so ill go into the recording booth area  laura ill be at the back all by myself  taliesin the recording booth door is locked  travis well its locked so  laura you want to go to check out the back offices with me  sam you are huge  liam you can deadlift a house you cant bust that shit open  travis its pretty solid with a fire door well let me try it can i back up and try to run  through /none/ the door  taliesin yeah you dont have anything fancy for that do a strength athletics just for fun  travis so that loads me up pretty good  taliesin thats a tough door though  travis thats a serious door yeah its no joke that is a ton of success thats five successes  and no failures  sam whoa five successes taliesin  taliesin sighs man i was really hoping well its okay i honestly wanted that door to survive  because its the most obnoxious door in the entire building  travis it really is yeah  /none/ taliesin its the most obnoxious door in the entire building its the only one the  keycard wont open i dont know why but that door comes off its hinges and pops open  laura holy crap  sam wow crossfit  travis yeah right  taliesin it goes flying off  travis in the doorway with my heightened senses can i see anything in the darkened room  taliesin oh yeah in the darkened room you can see in the corner theres two twitch hosts cuddled  up hiding theyve been down there  laura erika  taliesin no /none/ its not erika it appears to be amy dallen and jody houser hiding in the corner jody  has been furiously scribbling because shes afraid she still actually has a deadline if she ever  gets out of here amy dallen has been slowly building a little fort out of the computers to  stave off whatever it is thats been  travis amy josie  taliesin jody amy and jody  travis jody sorry  taliesin its okay ive been doing a lot of josie lately  travis are you guys okay  taliesin travis  travis yeah  /none/ taliesin its not safe shut the oh  travis i broke the door  taliesin theres things out there you dont oh theres bad things out there  travis can i come in the room  taliesin yeah of course  travis okay i walk in the room a little bit im still holding a giant sword  sam he needs to be invited in hes a vampire  taliesin you dont need to be invited in really  travis i dont oh shit  taliesin im glad you asked though its very polite  travis i was like i /none/ know this fucking game  liam let the right one in  travis can i tuck the sword behind my back real quick  taliesin yeah they saw it but  travis its not for you  taliesin theyre hip to whats going on and you do not look like what theyre afraid of theyre  not afraid of you yet  travis so im in the little engineering room right  taliesin yeah  travis is the booth clear is there anything in there youre sure  taliesin just food and drinks thats all weve just  travis do /none/ you mind if i look stay right where you are please dont move can i walk over to  the door and look through and see whats in the booth  taliesin mmhmm nothing  travis nothing not even food or drinks  taliesin no i mean food and drink theyve got a stash of they obviously raided a terrible  nerdist shoot for cheetos and whatever and weirdly yet another box of lucky charms i dont  know why we have so many of them  travis laura come in here  laura im already in the back office /none/  travis oh shit can anybody hear me  taliesin does anybody  sam we went to the bathroom  taliesin so depending on how loud you were they probably couldnt hear you  travis yeah that wasnt that loud  liam we might have faintly heard muffled noises  travis can i try to open the booth door  taliesin yeah it opens just fine  travis can i peek my head in and look behind the door check the corners  taliesin man you are nervous  travis just make sure its food and drink  taliesin as /none/ far as you can tell its just food and drink  travis can i use my aura perception to see if there is anything else in the room  taliesin whats the roll for that  travis it says hunger roll perception plus empathy minus manipulation plus willpower no  versus manipulation versus plus willpower  taliesin or a perception against people i believe so who are you running it against and  you can use it to figure out things like what kind of creature someone is you can get a  notion of how theyre feeling  travis /none/ let me get a notion of how amy is feeling since jody is just writing  taliesin yeah jody may have snapped a little its tough to tell  travis shes on the other side  taliesin sure make the roll and im going to use my fancy rolls now because things are going to get  weird have a blood die  travis so i roll three of these right  taliesin that one after i think you get it next roll  travis three successes no failures  taliesin three successes no failures and whats it versus for /none/ her  travis manipulation plus willpower  liam and laura i dont like it  taliesin that is something you do hear but its coming from somewhere  laura oh god  taliesin oh yeah shes scared but shes been here for a while and its tough to tell how long  and has gone into full fightorflight mode and has definitely gone fight and you definitely get the  sense that and you can read this from her aura she is human and she has killed something within  the last 72 hours you dont know what  travis /none/ amy im going to ask you to move back into the booth until we can make sure its more  safe can you tell me what youve seen and what you were hiding from  taliesin sighs there was a man he was older i didnt recognize him and he came with people  there was some creature and somethings wrong with ivan and  laura we havent even seen ivan yet  liam daddy chops  taliesin there was these things with these large eyes and these vacant mouths and i fought one and  then weve been hiding /none/ in here i dont know how long  travis weve seen the vacant eyes and mouths as well we put down two ourselves they laughed  afterwards  taliesin yeah they do that  travis thats really disturbing  taliesin it is i would say its been a long couple days except i dont know how long its been  travis okay i cant promise that its safe outside of this room and im sorry i broke the  door will you just wait inside the booth  taliesin how about you put the door back and well reinforce it /none/ and then knock seven times when  the coast is clear because no one will knock seven times because thats ridiculous  travis thats my normal knock but okay that sounds fair enough can i make a look around the  room before i leave for anything that might be used as a weapon its pretty bare right  taliesin yeah its pretty bare theres just the desks and a decent rough cut of thrashtopia  rolling on one of the monitors thats flickering  travis ill pick up the door back out of the room and pull it back /none/ there with the handle  taliesin good man wow thats a nice vampire thats good  laura hes not feeling it yet  taliesin where are you at three  travis yeah  taliesin all right well see how we feel in a minute cool  laura what happens if you get five hungers  travis thats a great question  taliesin thats a great question  laura im going to go back in the back office im going to use my obfuscate  taliesin because you have a secondlevel version right  laura thats right so i can be /none/ totally sneaky  taliesin youre going to be super sneaky youre going to burn a blood for that  laura okay what does that mean i get another blood  taliesin roll a d10 what did you get  laura two  taliesin oh yeah you get actually this is not the normal rolls this is me doing terrible things  because this is a short game  laura i get two extra im so hungry all of a sudden  taliesin you turned practically invisible but it cost you so youre going all the way back  laura past /dung/ where we filmed the slayers cake thing  taliesin past the library  laura through to  taliesin things start to get very weird back there  laura im looking for writing any clues i can find  taliesin so as you turn the corner the ground starts to slowly get dark and strangely inky that  whole office that youre used to seeing has been cleared and is empty  laura theres nobody in here  taliesin theres a table in the middle of the room and in the darkness you cant quite see the  walls its like /none/ you turned the corner and theres a table almost in a void and at the table are four  people playing cards its ivan ivan van norman is playing cards with amy vorpahl and damion  poitier and sam theyre all sitting playing cards ivan  sam not me sam theres another sam  taliesin no the other sam  travis ivan amy damion  taliesin and sam are playing cards its not a game you recognize ivans having a great time  everybody else looks a little nervous  laura do they smell good  taliesin they do  /none/ laura does ivan smell good  taliesin ivan smells pretty good but ivan smells a little burnt and his hair is what is the most  terrifying thing i can say about hair its like yahoo serious hair that is the most terrifying  thank you its standing up like hes been shocked like hes been putting his tongue in a  socket  liam is that true of his sideburns as well  taliesin oh yeah theyre all the way out  laura whose back is to me as im coming around the corner im assuming they dont see /none/ me because im  taliesin they dont and it would be  laura ivan  taliesin damions back is to you although sam has just pulled a card theyre showing the card  and theyre showing the card to ivan you cant quite make out what ivans saying but sams not  having a good time about it and is arguing with the rules for some strange reason and out of  nowhere a large spider comes out and pulls very quickly sam entirely away from the table  travis what from where  laura into the back corner  /none/ taliesin whatever is back there and then a chair floats into view and rolls up to where sam  was you just heard screams and a spider clack of muffled sounds  sam thats quite a card game  taliesin ivan turns amy youre up  laura and ivan seems completely unfazed by it but everybody else is creeped out  taliesin yeah ivans running a game and its amys turn  laura can i sneak around the room so im behind ivan  taliesin that might be difficult but you can give it a try  laura am i /none/ going to die  taliesin theres no roll for that second obfuscate you just burn and you do it right  laura i just do it oh wait no wits and stealth  taliesin roll a wits stealth  laura oh i should have done that earlier  taliesin its okay this will work just fine  laura do i have to use my two news  taliesin oh yeah  laura i do  taliesin yeah you do  laura i have to roll three reds on this  travis yep  shouldve taken your head out of your /none/ ass lets go  laura shut your fucking face stealth and wits okay hold on counting  liam lets go vampire  laura okay i got to choose my right dice here okay here we go oh my god  liam and laura come on  liam oh shit two failures  travis and liam on the reds  laura but i got a success  taliesin two failures on the red all right this is fun how hungry are you  laura it was already three and just because i did obfuscate it seems a little fucked up that /none/ i have  to use my new hungers on my power you didnt have to do that you didnt have to do that  travis quit blaming other people for your weakness  laura im just saying its bullshit  liam youre ruleslawyering a game you barely understand  laura yeah well  taliesin heres the deal youre going to get seen but well deal with that because i want you  to make a note you are hangry  laura im really fucking hungry  taliesin as in life no i have options here and im going hangry you /none/ are down three on any  persuasion or subterfuge rolls because you are not going to be subtle or cunning about anything  until you feed youre going to be really on edge  liam time for a taco hell run  taliesin amy vorpahl frighteningly pulls a card puts it down closes her eyes ivan pulls the  card looks at it smiles  laura do they see me yet  taliesin not yet and then ivan turns to amy and amy its like every piece of her rotates 45  degrees against itself not like meat but like /none/ glass and then she shatters like a mirror and  then a new chair pops right up  travis cleanly does blood explode  taliesin no its just glass  travis fragments amy fragments  laura did it seem like amy was a vampire before she shattered  taliesin no she smelled pretty good  laura can i  taliesin ivan turns to you but damion has not seen you  laura im going to walk up behind damion  and bite the shit out of his neck  taliesin okay you have surprise on him but not ivan ivans /none/ going to allow it  laura okay i figured  taliesin roll actually since this is surprise roll wits this is going to be weird roll wits  and stealth im going to make this a weird one  laura thats what i just rolled and it was not good  taliesin yeah try it again how much are you going to eat him are you going to eat him a  little some or a lot  laura whispering i want to suck his blood  taliesin okay  laura a good amount of it not all of it /none/  taliesin not all of it  laura im going to leave him twitching success one success  taliesin one success  laura yeah  taliesin that didnt count because that hit paper ignore me boy he did not see you coming  laura he didnt  taliesin nope  laura so i get to suck his blood  taliesin yeah but only one point worth because that was not a lot of success  laura at least thats something  taliesin hes very conscious and aware that something is on his neck right now and hes  freaking out /none/ hes going to take a swipe at you  laura maybe im part of ivans game  liam hes real big  taliesin yeah hes a big guy  laura he had a lot of blood  taliesin hes currently wearing my jacket too so if you get any blood on my jacket im going to  be very upset  sam is he wearing your jacket because youre dead  taliesin no hes wearing my jacket because i lent it to him at the end of wednesday club last  week and i havent gotten it back yet  /none/ laura you smell like taliesin wheres taliesin  taliesin that got weird thank you so im figuring out how to do this hes going to try and  kick you off roll dex dodge because hes going to try and take a swipe at you dex dodge and if  you want you can burn willpower to roll the ones you dont like over again  liam thats five you get four right  laura i get five  liam three plus  laura dodge its four  taliesin anything over a six  laura one success  sam and /none/ taliesin burn a will  laura i dont even know what that means  taliesin do you see those little will dots you burn one and you can reroll any of the  dice you like  travis are you marking it off  laura and for each willpower i reroll a dice  taliesin you can reroll as many dice as you like on one roll for one willpower  laura okay ill try it because youre saying to do it two more successes  taliesin thats all you needed theres a rule that i forgot but thats okay /none/ ill do it next  time ill remember that succeed at a cost i keep forgetting about succeed at a cost its  really cool yeah you slap him down and youre right back in his neck if you want to do a  strength plus two for your vampire fangs  laura strength plus two  taliesin yeah strength plus two dice  liam get that big gulp  laura chomping sounds ooh well no no failures but one success  taliesin one success you get one more out of him  liam why did you hit the mouse /none/ again  taliesin why do you keep hitting my mouse man  laura well hes sitting right there  taliesin do you want to keep draining or do you want to back off  laura no im good im going to let him live  taliesin are you going to back off or you just let go  laura im going to push him forward against the table and back off really quickly  taliesin are you going to push him forward against the table  laura yeah so he doesnt lunge at me as i back up  taliesin /none/ snorts yeah fuck it thats funny im going to let that happen he slips as you push  him towards the table and he leaves his seat and falls off into the darkness he falls like he fell  off a building down  laura like he cant walk in the darkness like im walking  taliesin he was on the table and you pushed off and pushed him off his seat and theres no floor  apparently because he just dropped  laura whoops  taliesin you seem to be standing on it fine but it didnt work for /none/ him  laura what ivan hi  taliesin hey laura its so good to see you this is great  laura you too man this looked like a pretty crazy game youre playing  taliesin ive been really excited ive been wanting to get you in one of my games for a while  this is the best one ive put together in quite a while  laura yeah i remember paranoia with you  taliesin that was fun my whole game has gone to another level ive had a really this has  been a good year you want /none/ to play  laura no you know what i think im good  taliesin i think it could be worth your while  laura do you know what the deal is with that circle out by the twitch door is  taliesin i do i know a lot about whats going on i have talked to so many people  laura you have  taliesin oh yes i have its been fascinating  laura how long has it been  taliesin sighs i feel you havent earned that kind of information yet honestly i feel that  this whole sneakinguponmygame /none/ and trying to like honestly costing damion his turn thats  just tacky  laura i just thought were on the same side here  taliesin theres no sides were all friends and its just a game you want to play the game  laura no  taliesin ill make it worth your while you win a little bit and maybe therell be some answers in  here for you  laura it didnt seem like it was possible to win  taliesin well heres what ill say i have so many cards that could be pulled and the cards /none/ they  pulled are already gone  laura travis learned this lesson before  taliesin see if you think about it though travis is really the reason this is happening  right now the whole theory for this game is because of travis you should pull a card he  really likes it when you pull cards  travis i really do  taliesin pulling cards makes the father happy  laura i kind of want to pull a card  sam sure of course you do  taliesin sit down  travis yeah laughs yes  sam oh boy /none/  laura i will sit down if you answer a question as i sit down and then ill pull a card  taliesin it entirely depends on the question  laura okay i sit down  taliesin you feel heavy as you sit down  laura this is a stupid idea marisha sat down and had some tea she died  taliesin marisha drank the tea oh hes not going to be happy why would she thats not smart  laura i dont know i wasnt there i just know that she drank tea and then she turned into a /none/  mushroom  taliesin yeah thatll happen  laura how come we were put in coffins and turned into vampires and some people are delicious  taliesin oh thats really complicated thats a very complicated question theres a lot happening  and im going to be honest with you not all of this was the plan i specifically get the feeling  that a lot of this has gone a little offtrack  laura yeah it seems like it  taliesin it does doesnt it im doing what i can but really what can we do other than trying  /none/ to make some good content you know  laura right yeah just waiting for the door to open to the twitch stage  taliesin thats a cute clever puzzle how are you doing on that  laura well were doing pretty good pretty good looking for clues  taliesin what have you solved so far  laura i will answer that if you make sure i pull a good card beneficial card for me not for you  travis oh shit  taliesin electricity crackles from the back of his spine and seems to make an arcing pattern  through /none/ the darkness thats almost a circuit breaker oh heart and sun not bad  laura oh shit  sam he knows things  taliesin im running a game here i got to be on top of it if youre not on top of it thats how you lose  laura i turned into a vampire youre some weird electric thing thats fun  laughter  taliesin sighs its just crazy the sorts of people you work with here isnt it  laura i know  taliesin yeah hell be very happy if you take a card you can yell for /none/ people by the way theres no  problem this is a game for everybody  laura yeah i did yell for him  travis how loud  laura travis about that loud  travis thats i mean youre way back there  laura i know but i dont know how quiet it is in the building  taliesin and you do have  travis i do have heightened senses can i hear her  taliesin how loud  laura travis  taliesin no laughs  travis i mean if you want to be a big girl about it laughs  /none/ liam can we lower the gain on the mic though  taliesin yeah no thats fair i mean we can call everybody over if you like  laura i just feel like hes really going to want to pull a card and i dont know if he should i  feel like maybe if this is a bad thing then well this will be just me and then they will  never know  taliesin all right  travis this has been going on for a while  laura yeah  taliesin pick a card  laura yells  taliesin /none/ make a pull  laura is this one of those magician tricks where youre telling me to pull a certain one and i  dont realise it  taliesin yes  travis ill say i pulled from the middle before and it was the void  taliesin there is no void card in this set because this is not a deck of many things you  pulled the two of swords oh dear  sam which is  taliesin two of swords is two bleeds suddenly blood gets sucked straight out of your fingertips  through the card into the /none/ base  laura oh no i just got rid of these things  taliesin two more  laura shit ugh  taliesin that was a rough pull  laura yeah dude it was  taliesin but everything has a price and so for that swords swords are about knowledge so what  do you want to know  travis ooh  taliesin if i can answer it i will ill find something i can answer  sam whispering the puzzle  laura how do i solve the hmm  taliesin thats too broad  laura what coincides with the picture /none/ of the head on the puzzle  taliesin well let me find out on my sheet  laughter  taliesin i made too many notes  laura am i still bleeding from my fingertips creepily all things considered though this isnt  as bad as the spider or the shattering body  liam or a horse  taliesin no you did okay so there are  laura im holding my hands up so i stop bleeding  taliesin swords are about its taken it theyve closed up the card itself gave you paper  cuts and sucked everything out and /none/ then they  laura i hate paper cuts  taliesin right on the fingertips too  travis like a surgeon  laura yeah  taliesin heads are knowledge theyre the base of consciousness you need to make an offering of  understanding you need to find a symbol of understanding whats happening and what you are  you need to find something that expresses that understanding  laura that we know that were vampires basically  taliesin yes and you have to prove it now so you have to find something that proves that you  know that youre vampires /none/ something of intellectual proof of it now i might know where  something is but thats another question  laura i think im okay  travis ive made my way back to the back at this point hey hey ivan  laura ivan hes made of electricity now  travis thats fun  taliesin things have gotten weird  travis i gather  laura baby i pulled a card  travis you did  laura yeah  taliesin it made father very happy i think you should pull a card too  travis yeah  laura okay but you didnt /none/ see what happened with the other cards there was a giant  travis how bad could it be  laura amy rotated like she was made of glass and then shattered like gone  taliesin that cards only one pull so thats fine  laura and sam got eaten by a giant spider  taliesin the other sam  travis you know what ivan im a fan of card games i am  taliesin have you sat down by the way  travis i havent im a fan of card games i hate to rush into anything too hastily  /none/ laura im so hungry  travis yeah you dont look so great maybe well check out the rest of this floor real fast and  then ill come back  taliesin hopefully ill be here when you get back but fine  laura can i get up  taliesin no i need a player  travis do you need us to send in chris or arcade  taliesin i dont care who you send in i just need a player  travis fair enough sam  liam were in the bathroom right  sam me sam  travis yeah  /none/ sam yeah i think were in the bathroom right  laura you just hid in the bathroom the whole time  sam no i dont know  liam no we left off of us ages a while back  taliesin the bathrooms are sadly the bathrooms except more so  liam theres nothing going on in the bathrooms  sam we didnt find anything in the walls  taliesin you found some toilet paper  sam anything to eat  taliesin you found some toilet paper you found the weird little ghost that hides in the have  you ever /none/ seen the ghost on the pipe you can pull that lever and see what happens  liam we could keep going back around theres conference rooms back there now where they keep  all the games where you shot the slayers cake  sam yeah lets go search  liam those dragon torches are there too  taliesin you guys are going to go check out the library wall  sam as we go im going to tell liam listen i convinced laura that im on her side  liam did she believe you  sam totally  liam are /none/ you sure  sam yes when she goes down shes going to try to kick you or throw you down or trip you up but  im going to walk behind her club her in the back of the head and were going to make off like  bandits  liam i know  taliesin so are you guys going as far as the bookcase are you guys going deeper in  sam the bookcase is literally the end of my knowledge of the way out of the building  liam i will lead sam unless we see something of /none/ note  taliesin you want to take a look at the bookcase  liam sure do i see anything  sam is there more building past the bookcase  liam there is a little bit more theres a couple of conference rooms glass doors windows  taliesin there was a map that you guys could find but youre never going to find it which  makes me laugh really hard but yes theres a  liam yeah were walking past these shelves of tabletop games  taliesin all right you can do a perception investigation  liam yeah sure  /none/ sam perception investigation  taliesin or you can use occult if thats a better number for you as well  sam i failed on a red  taliesin you got a one on a red  sam yes  liam i also failed on a red  taliesin you both failed on a red but what was your score total  liam two successes one fail on a red  sam one success  taliesin you guys you talk about looking at the bookshelf but youre just talking to each other  and going back and forth talking about how /none/ foolish laura was to trust you yeah youre just doing a  bit you just keep doing a bit  liam if we get through this we have to record another episode of the podcast and not one that  we do at the convention sam  sam we recorded one at the convention and then i never edited it  liam you never edited it dumbass  sam man we have it right now its already done  liam yeah we got to release that one  taliesin yuck nope nevermind that didnt happen  liam theres another one /none/ just you and me  sam with some other people yeah well do that  travis laura  laura what  travis why dont you stand up and come with me and well come back  laura i cant  taliesin she cant stand up until i say so and i need a player  travis is that right  laura i can try  taliesin you can try and stand up  laura straining  taliesin okay you now see whats in front of you once youre  sam oh god whats going on  laura i cant stand /none/ up im so hungry  liam shes nowhere near us  travis ivans here and has electrical powers  sam oh okay  liam oh the voided room is back here oh i didnt realize where it was  taliesin i feel like im the only one whos explored this entire building there are some  nooks and crannies man  liam i know whats in the actual building i didnt know the void was back here  taliesin spend enough time back there and its a real void its kind of intense  trais apparently ivans made of electricity /none/ now and he has a card game for us to play but he  needs players  taliesin come sit  laura sam you want to come play this card game  liam and do what  sam why cant looks like youre playing  travis how many chairs are there  taliesin three two two empty chairs along with her  travis of the three of us only two others can play  taliesin or once i have somebody else sitting down somebody else can get up  liam what to fill the chairs what kind of game is /none/ it  travis you draw a card she drew a card and learned something  laura i did i learned something about the thing  sam it seems like travis should play hes a card guy  liam straight up do you think this is safe for me  travis i dont know  taliesin is anything safe i mean come on people  liam what do you feel for me i mean  travis given my general feeling of our environment i think almost all this shits fucked up  liam okay  travis just a fair bit of /none/ sprinkling of that just about everywhere i look  sam can we find someone else to play this game  travis yeah i think so  sam why dont we go find somebody else to play this game are there any others  travis thats a good idea actually sam why dont you go snag  liam dani  travis max  laura did we see max yet  sam wheres max  travis max is back in the office hes wearing a drink me sign why dont you go snag max  sam all right if im not back /none/ in 30 seconds  laura thats a long walk  taliesin are you going to walk or are you going to jog  sam ill run  taliesin all right well done you you go really fast  travis oh two of them  laura you have a power  sam i have a power whats my power  taliesin you go really fast  laura whoa  sam celerity  liam is he a speedster now  sam your body responds so quickly that the world around you seems to slow down  all whoa  taliesin i was /none/ really hoping you were going to try and hit arcade at some point and there was  just going to be a fwap but no you were so nice  sam oh wow i go all over the place okay all right so im going to run back there  taliesin if we burn that blood you are back in seconds with max he doesnt even really quite  register what happened  sam burn that blood what do i do whats  taliesin you just have an extra blood die now  laura max come sit down  taliesin /none/ he is at the point where he is just going to do what hes told so he sits down  travis max sit down at the table  laura yeah can i get up  taliesin yeah you can get up  laura i get up  travis now before we leave i would like to see a card drawn  laura oh okay max can pull one then  travis yeah max pull a card  taliesin this is my best max face i dont know how well its coming out  laughter  taliesin max jolts and has /none/ a weird clarity to him for the first time in it seems like his eyes  unpuffen and he just looks like a normal moisture comes back to his face and he looks  slightly healthier and hes got a moment of weve got to get out of here before that thing upstairs  comes down  travis whats upstairs max  taliesin its this creature its just teeth and claws and im not going to say wolf but theres  something up there thats big and  travis beastlike  taliesin its been a lot theres been a lot /none/ thats happened  travis max the last thing we remember is leaving after the last game how long have you been here  taliesin after the last game thats the last thing you sighs  laura max what happened how long has it been  taliesin its been a long week  laura its been a whole week  sam is it thursday again  taliesin i havent seen the sun in three days four days i dont know what no one knows whats  going on things have gotten very weird but youve got to get us out of /none/ here  laura do people in the outside world know whats happening  travis when i look at ivan does he look disappointed or pleased with the outcome of this  card pull  taliesin hes waiting for another player  travis all right max come with us  taliesin i cant get up  travis i thought that might be happening yeah ill tell you what max sit tight well be back  for you ivan well try and find you another player  taliesin i and ill say if you wanted to see if you can figure out /none/ a little bit more about  whats happening cant win if you dont play  travis i mean he has a good point  sam yeah  laura thats true  taliesin max you want to pick another card  travis tell him to pick another card  sam make max do it no we need to do it so we know  travis youre right youre right sam  sam you want me to do it  travis i mean you had the inspiration one of us should pick a card  laura you should do it  travis /none/ its you  liam youre certainly the most clever person at the table  laura yeah youll be able to solve it  sam if i sit down though will i be able to get up again  travis yeah as long as max is at the table  taliesin as long as max doesnt get up  sam all right ill draw a card  taliesin sit down draw a card  sam what could possibly go wrong  liam it can only go right  laura whatd you get whatd you get  sam the three of swords /none/ more blood  laura three bloods  taliesin yeah what are you at  sam im at three  laura you have three bloods already  liam uhoh spaghettioh  laura oh no youve maxed out your hunger  taliesin you stand up actually im not even going to bother with this ooh yeah thats  okay you at a speed that no one can even grasp you stand up theres a blur and before anyone  can notice you are at zero health you are fine give me all your blood dice your blood is at zero  liam /none/ youre not hungry any more  taliesin youre not hungry at all  liam at all  sam what happened  taliesin youre not hungry  travis how does max look  taliesin max is very pale and hes not moving  laura gasps you killed max  travis youre fast as shit  laura sam you killed max  travis can i run over to max and check his pulse with my fingers on his carotid  taliesin the only reason max isnt slumping over is hes still glued to the seat  sam gruffly i dont know what /none/ came over me  taliesin max is dead  laura im going to take my dagger and try to stab ivan while hes distracted with all of that  sam yelling its on wait i get a question i get a question first  travis we were going to get fucking knowledge first we were supposed to get knowledge  taliesin you go in and try and stab ivan  laura im going to try to stab ivan  taliesin all right lets do dex plus  travis max died for nothing  laura he would have let you die /none/ he wouldnt let you leave  sam what  laura you would have been stuck here forever  liam but we could have used him and gotten an answer  travis he was already up out of the chair  taliesin you still get a question well see how it goes dex plus melee  laura dex plus melee  taliesin yeah  laura melee not brawl  taliesin no you have a weapon  travis you do  laura oh really thats so dumb  taliesin yeah take it  laura i didnt know thats what it meant  /none/ taliesin ill tell you what whats your level two power  laura obfuscate unseen presence  taliesin oh thats right youre obfuscate never mind  laura i could have done it before he realized what i was doing  taliesin no you can take a stab see how it goes  laura cool what strength plus melee  taliesin im letting you do dex melee  travis i like the impulse to violence  taliesin i love it  sam but you know why shes doing this its because we made a pact to stick together shes  protecting me /none/  laura thats definitely why im doing it sam ooh three successes and a crit well just one  ten not technically a crit but all three were successes  liam singing shot to the heart and youre too late  laura god thats so many dice  taliesin three successes and crit two successes and a crit okay so im going to give you  success with point you pin him with the blade to the table  laura oh shit  taliesin thats uncalled for  laura well you just seemed like you were probably kind of mean /none/  taliesin this is really this is a lot this is a lot  laura i dont know whats going on ivan im sorry  travis is he bleeding profusely  taliesin no  liam is he bleeding at all  taliesin no  travis you know what they say about shit that doesnt bleed  taliesin hes stuck to the chair though  laura yeah well at least maybe sam ask your question  taliesin i feel like theres things that need to be addressed before we get to a question i want  to play the game as /none/ much as anybody but  laura i mean im just saying the game is still going on i totally interrupted the game you  know we should just i just try to hold him on to the chair im just going to keep holding on  taliesin no can you help with this this is a lot  laura yeah no im trying to let you go but im definitely trying to keep him in the chair im  trying to let it youre not coming off of it  taliesin these prop replicas are really well made this is /none/ not  sam can i get off the chair that im on or no  taliesin weirdly the corpse is making it possible at the moment  sam oh okay ill stay there so we can ask our questions or whatever  laura whispering ask your question quick  sam oh yes my question can we  travis ivan my wife is very careful about these things  taliesin i understand this has been a very stressful time for everybody but lets  sam i just killed max  taliesin yeah you did  sam its super stressful  taliesin /none/ that wasnt cool  sam sorry  taliesin that was really uncalled for like its all fun and games sure and we poke you a  little bit here im going to poke you but come on jeez  liam im going to come up behind laura and press into her elbow and ill press the blade in and use  awe again and say ivan i mean its really all about leverage right we need some information  and i feel like weve earned it  taliesin whats the roll for that  liam charisma

other end of the building  snarling  travis from the where other end  laura from where  travis the front of the building  taliesin from the front of the building snarling  laura we should get in the twitch stage we should go in  taliesin as you walk theres two probably tenfoot tall wolves slowly making their way into  the kitchen  travis bipedal  taliesin theyre quadripedic at the moment but it seems like there might be the option and one /none/  of them has some brilliant tattoo work up the front arms  laura oh my god rachel rachel turned into a werewolf  liam its romero  taliesin the two of them are starting to make their way toward you  travis wait lets try and communicate  laura travis they are going to kill us were vampires werewolves hate vampires youve seen  enough of those movies  taliesin you guys better go quick  sam im going to take the smart girls boy and throw him on the floor in front of us  taliesin okay  /none/ sam and then run into the twitch room  laura yeah im going to run into the twitch room  taliesin youre going to run into the twitch room everybody roll because ive been wanting to  try this where did it go there it is roll wits plus where did it go roll this is going to be  weird roll wits plus im trying to find the thing to do with this this is going to be weird  wits plus athletics im trying something interesting honestly except for sam sam doesnt  have to roll anything because /none/ you are fast as fuck  laura you have the best three successes triple sixes creepy  liam two successes  laura oh no whatd you do  sam you got no successes on yours  travis three successes and two fails one of which is red  taliesin okay the rest of you make your way into the room travis is for some reason still  staring at that boy on the ground the two wolves make a jump and grab the boy and start tearing  into him make a wits roll to get yourself out of there /none/  travis another wits just wits theyre all red thats a success a ten and a one  taliesin what the fuck okay yeah the door is jamming on you a little bit i mean youre there  youre on the door its jamming a little bit theyre having a bit of an argument over who gets  to eat the kid and theres a bit of a back and forth its like a meetcute  travis the wolf with the tattoos and the other one with the shaved sides  taliesin yeah with the shaved sides and theyre having /none/ a bit of a run  laura its totally ed and rachel  taliesin yeah your success and your failure yeah give me a boy you can add wits athletics  or wits survival and i would recommend burning either some blood or some will or doing something  i keep rolling like shit  travis i dont know how to burn will but ill do whatever  taliesin you knock off a will you can add athletics or  travis ill add athletics come on athletics  laura muscle your way through the door much better  travis five /none/ successes and one red failure  taliesin thats good enough im going to say you get to the other side of the door but man youre  not even going to look for a minute youre going to sit at the other side of that door and listen  as the two of them tear this poor kid to shreds he is jerky  sam i love how he is a full adult male grownup employee but hes a kid now  taliesin were all kids once were in the jaws of a werewolf man everybodys a kid once youre /none/ a  vampire and you can hear the werewolves clawing at the door  liam i grab laura and say listen he might die he might die and if hes gone you and i are  going to need each other so you need to keep me alive so i can protect you and i use presence  awe on her  taliesin all right roll it  laura dont you have to roll every time you use it so you risk getting another hunger dice  taliesin he gets a hunger dice if it works yeah  liam four /none/ successes one of which is a red die  taliesin ah wow thats a good plan it was good enough that let me double check  liam there is no versus on the sheet  taliesin yeah actually roll perception willpower yeah youre a vampire  laura wheres willpower  taliesin youve probably burned one of them already its at the bottom left  laura oh okay so i have three willpowers okay success success four successes  taliesin how many were you at liam  liam four one of them was red it was a crit well i need /none/ two crits  taliesin i flipped a coin anyway because thats how i enjoy the moment ive got these great coins  and im glad i get to use them yeah he makes sense  laura yeah of course im going to make sure youre okay  liam i mean if travis doesnt come back or if he does come back its wise to keep me alive so i  can protect you  laura this doesnt make any sense but so much sense at the same time i will protect you so  you can protect me okay thats /none/ how it always is  taliesin meanwhile travis comes back  travis what are you talking about  laura liam said i need to protect him so he can protect me but the thing is youre back so you  can protect all of us  travis thats so funny he kind of said something similar to me  liam and you love laura so to keep her alive  travis can i use my aura perception to understand what liam is doing  liam reverse math  travis it says interplay of colors in an aura provides insight into /none/ the subjects emotions  taliesin ill say you can wait i get to say it you can certainly try  travis okay you have to roll manipulation plus willpower versus my perception plus empathy  taliesin its that bottom left  laura we should block the door so that rachel and ed cant get in here  sam that was rachel and ed  laura yeah dude did you see the tattoos  sam oh my god  laura while theyre doing this im going to push one of the heavy things in front of the door  taliesin all /none/ right i mean i would say make a strength check but you guys probably together are  going to have no problem finding things to move  travis four successes  liam three  taliesin three successes four you can read his aura  laura what does that mean  travis it means insight into his emotions motives and nature  taliesin yeah so what insight would you like  travis id like to know why hes asking everyone to protect him  laura because he wants to survive man  taliesin why are you asking everyone to protect you /none/  liam i need to live  taliesin there you go i had a funny feeling it would work out that way  travis youre asking my wife to look out for you if it comes down to it  liam so i can protect her uhhuh  travis what about me  liam well youre stronger than me how am i going to protect you thats silly  travis right yeah makes sense where are we  sam were inside of the twitch  laura were inside the twitch stages  sam were here were in this room  /none/ laura were like right here  taliesin yeah were about 30 feet away  travis can we take a look around  taliesin yeah  laura i am going to obfuscate  taliesin thats smart lets give you a little bit of red  liam tal i never got a penalty for what i did  taliesin yeah youre going to get one right there you get one there  travis ill use my heightened senses to  taliesin oh wow yeah there are no people in here but all of the equipment is running and  there are some /none/ lights on back at the critical role stage  sam are we live on twitch  laura oh crazy are we like out there how fucking creepy would it be if we walked out  travis fucking dont jump out and scare me i will attack whoever comes out here  taliesin thats good to know  travis if you jump out on me its not going to go well for that person  taliesin are you going to look around at all other than like as you walk over theres little  nooks and crannies  laura im going /none/ to stay away from them so that i can be sneaky  taliesin youre going to be sneaky which direction are you going to come from  laura im going to go well theres really only one way around im going to go around this back  way around that other stage so that when they come up this way  taliesin you do see a pile of corpses back there  laura oh shit  taliesin they look like very competent corpses the corpses of extremely competent people who make  things work  sam our crew  laura /none/ oh god like around the other side of the stage like theyre hidden  taliesin theyre kind of piled in the shoebox at the moment also make a perception check really  quickly a base perception check  laura thats cocked unfortunately one success  taliesin everythings been manhandled everythings changed things have been moved  around everythings a little shifted the wednesday club table is leaning against the door  back here people have been moved around thats my weird music  laura yeah i couldnt tell it sounded like the crew was making creepy noises  taliesin the /none/ talks set has been folded away and is in a little package everythings been strewn  through and theres some new go ahead  laura can i look for my dice bag my giant one thats as big as a head so i can roll like dice  on the ground if i need to  taliesin you know where to find it so you go look for it as you open up the cabinet there  seems to be some sort of i dont know it looks like maybe its a pyrotechnic device it looks  like something designed /none/ to explode in the cabinet  laura like its going to explode if i touch it or i can take it  taliesin do you touch things that look like theyre going to explode  laura not usually is it close by my bag that i need  taliesin its near it but i would not make you roll to miss it because its far enough away  its on a different shelf but theres a little glowing light in there connected to things that  definitely resemble some sort of dynamite or c4 theres some sort of explosive device /none/ in here  laura im going to take my bag  liam laura whered you go  taliesin youre liamed man no one can see you youre the shade  laura i said i took it  taliesin you guys where are you heading  travis which way did you go to the left oh you went to the right  laura well i got my dice and i was going to go around but i can come up this way  taliesin and she saw the giant pile of chief and courtney  travis oh we recognize a few /none/ of the corpses  taliesin i mean it depends on how yeah probably its a good pile  travis ill make my way toward the command center where all the computers and tricasters  taliesin theyre all running theres somebody sitting at the head of the table but you cant  quite see its no one you recognize and you cant quite figure out who it is theres a little  offkilter  laura youre making sure nobodys going to jump out at you  travis yeah i was entranced  taliesin everythings a little off  travis i keep /none/ going up more  taliesin you see painted in blood across the outside of the set  laura this set  taliesin this set life needs things to live  laura oh my god taliesins inside are you inside this set  travis the person that i cant see hello  taliesin you see hair theres a little tuft of white hair and someone furiously writing notes  travis excuse me we just made our  taliesin you made it oh thats super there in front of you is a pale older gentleman with a  bit of a beard /none/ and thin at the hair but hes an older gentleman quite pale and porcelain skin  like hes definitely i dont want to say jolly vampire but theres something so charming about him  travis do we recognize his face  taliesin make an intelligence oh what would i call this either academics or occult  laura are you all walking in the set  sam liam and i never said which way we had gone  liam no  travis that is two successes of three dice  taliesin yeah no  liam i think i would be a /none/ good ways behind big man watching him work his magic  travis i just rolled academics nothing else  taliesin im so glad to meet you this is great i mean there have been some problems i admit it  there were some things that didnt really go the way i wanted them to but hey hey youre here  wheres everybody else  travis im sorry to interrupt you are you responsible for the puzzle lock on the door  taliesin yeah i mean were supposed to do a thing and i really enjoy these kind of things  /none/ ivan was really happy to help so we sort of actually ivan really helped put it

situation do you happen to know whats going  on around here  taliesin yeah and ive been looking forward to you guys figuring out my puzzle and coming on in  this is great im so excited about the next stage of everything this is really super exciting  travis is there anyone else in this studio at the moment  taliesin probably not at the moment ive got some people outside were ready to load the  trucks everythings up to go everything is more or less set up ive got some people weve got /none/  some things coming in and out theres a lot of commotion this is a big process  travis outside forgive me this is all very new to me but isnt the sun up outside  taliesin for a minute longer and then of course ivan can take care of that hes very clever that  way but we have people i mean youll know this someday you get to a certain point and you have  people who can do these things for you its really nice  travis right sam liam laura  sam im coming up and /tavern/ im going to say big fan  taliesin thank you see the riddle was a double thing because you know vampires come from a  box and dungeons  dragons comes from a box its a double pun i was really it was actually ivan  who came up with it but i signed off  liam still not in and im unscrewing two pipes for a microphone setup so i can have a bar in my hand  taliesin its smart to have  laura im creeping around the side and stealthily peeking  taliesin make an investigation check /none/  sam is he on this set or is he at the control board  taliesin hes sitting right here make a perception investigation im excited to see if  you find this  sam im going to pull out my wyrmwood gaming tray from under the table over there and hand it to him  and ask him to sign it  taliesin oh happily he is into it  laura six successes  taliesin there is a breeze coming from under the wednesday club table  laura like here  taliesin yeah if you look behind the wednesday /none/ club table there is a tunnel going down  somewhere so its

apologize  sam /dung/ you killed our dungeon master so  taliesin i mean hes going to be fine though hes going to be fine   travis he turned to ash in the sun  taliesin what  travis yeah unfortunately  sam are you saying that once the magic is broken everybody comes back to life again  taliesin no what wait wheres matt  travis matthew mercer opened a curtain near the front of the building and was struck by a ray of  sunlight is that not reversible  taliesin i mean i was aware that one of you might /dung/ something bad might happen but we need him  travis its not just matt  sam we do need him for the show  taliesin i mean you guys ended everything we worked really hard to make sure you can keep doing  this for as long as we need and you let your dungeon master walk into the sun you guys

looking for laura outside of the critical role table  taliesin is liam dead too  sam no liams alive  taliesin or not hes undead apparently we went to all this trouble  travis marisha turned to mushroom  taliesin oh for gods sakes  travis there was tea apparently and /none/ she had some  taliesin well apparently you had some people working here who werent entirely human and  apparently we

the vecna statue you dont happen to have a pen on  you do you  taliesin lets flip oh as he reaches for a pen suddenly at great speed theres a blur that  comes and smashes him against the side of the wall he is briefly dazed as you see theres  another vampire teeth out eyes blazing holding him against the wall and he turns and looks at  you all and matt colville says this is your moment run run and /none/ goes in and holds gary  gygax against the wall  travis where  sam lets get out of here  laura outside tunnel ive got a tunnel theres a tunnel  sam lets go out the tunnel  travis no he said there was a studio downstairs  liam blam blam blam  taliesin theyre starting to wrestle with each other  travis we run down the tunnel  taliesin you run man just as you run down the tunnel gary gygax
