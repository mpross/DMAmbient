none	 from the temple of the false serpent on the island of urukayxl had managed to nearly drown in  the escape make their way through the jungle being chased by both yuanti and the lizardmen  denizens of this island making their way to the shore just in time to have the actual pirate ship  the squalleater there to defend you firing various heavy cannonballs towards the creatures  which had given chase and allowing you to escape on the boats to safety upon reaching the top of  the ship you found that the mistake has been repaired 
none	 enough to be seaworthy though it does  need some more intense repairs your supplies are relatively low and it looks like the current  goal is to find your journey westward to the island of darktow which has been wiped from your  knowledge wiped from the clovis concords control many years ago and currently resides as  the center of all piracy in the lucidian ocean as you all went to rest for the evening fjord who  will be here shortly so i can continue to embarrass him had an evenings conversation with  captain avantika in 
none	 which it was discussed his past history with his childhood father figure who  also seemed to have a history with avantika as well and is somehow rolled in with this strange  ukotoa phenomenon it also came to light that this shipwreck which gave fjord his powers might  have a connection based on the captains intuition with where this third and final sphere  may lie and it was decided between the two of them that this may be the next goal beyond  darktow to pursue after which they fucked  laura screaming  laughter  matt 
none	 while that era of the story is transpiring i want to ask you guys since we have a moment here  liam while theyre fucking  matt or in the loose wibblywobbly timeywimey period of figuring things out as you recover from  the intense return to the ship what would you like to do is there anything you want to check up  on first of all everyone leveled up to seven  laura did we get a long rest after  matt this would be the long rest for everyone but fjord i guess  sam nice this 
none	 isnt the next few days of our sailing adventure this is that night  matt this is that night we will then begin to embark on what that journey will be but if  theres anything you wish to do before the evenings done  taliesin i already gave my shade im done honestly that was all i needed  liam i would try to locate caduceus on the boat actually i dont know if hes hiding or not  taliesin oh im in my room because i was is this before fjord came back  matt we can say 
none	 this is while fjord is out  taliesin okay so im in my room  liam i will go to where he is on the boat and knocking  taliesin hey mister caleb good evening  liam you look  taliesin battered  liam tired as i feel do you have a moment  taliesin sure what can i do for you  liam may i come in  taliesin oh yes of course  liam clears throat i feel a little poorly for the time you have been having traveling with us  it was not a very good 
none	 day its been a string of bad ones in fact and i am grateful to have you  along with this group because we get hurt a lot and stick our noses places maybe we shouldnt you  have been very helpful  taliesin i think im coming to the realization that perhaps i was not entirely clear on what i  signed up for but i dont think that means that its the wrong path im getting used to the idea  that it wouldnt be a test if it were easy  liam is it your intention to 
none	 continue on with us  taliesin i i joined your group of friends i guess our group of friends now as a testament of  faith and it would be a disservice to that faith to turn around because its hard if itd have  been easy i suppose i wouldnt have been needed to be called to it ive been thinking a lot about  it jester gave me a lot to think about to be honest  liam well sometimes acts of good faith deserve to be rewarded when they can i wanted to give  you something 
none	 that will make your time with us a little bit easier i suppose i start to pull the  periapt out and untie it this you know im always so far back away from i hear you laura  in my peripheral i hear you im always very far back anyway this isnt doing me much good and  its better that you stay up more than i stay up because if you go down thats it this is a  little bit of extra protection anyway  taliesin mister caleb do you believe in fate there are lots of 
none	 different kinds of fate i know  thats a heavy question but do you believe that we are driven towards something by things that are  greater than ourselves  background music  liam i dont know i would like to think not but i dont know  taliesin there are times that i think about the cruelties of the world and the things that have  been put upon me and my family and i would hate for that to be a plan and there are times when  like today im very grateful for being in the right 
none	 place at the right time to make sure that  the right people are becoming strong in ways they need to be i dont think that excuses the pain i  dont think that you have to i dont know i dont think that you have to not care about it or  fight it with everything youve got but i think the world is shaping you into something important  and i want to make sure that you get to wherever you need to be  liam thats a pretty big matzo ball  taliesin you wont have to 
none	 work very hard at it i imagine i think just being you wherever the  world puts you will do just fine  liam if you have this this is magic by the way  taliesin i can tell  liam here you go  taliesin thank you  liam i help you that makes it easier to help all of us  taliesin i promise i will continue to help you all even when were not the best of people i  feel like were still moving towards something thats good and worthwhile and im feeling the  struggles 
none	 in my way to bring us to where we need to be  liam welcome to the nein  taliesin im honored  liam okay i feel like shit so im going to go to bed  taliesin thank you for this i wont forget it  chair scrape  marisha just like fjord  laughter  taliesin meanwhile one hour later  liam rolling them double ones  matt you get to remove that item and you get to add it to your  taliesin im adding which item  liam periapt of wound closure it just feels right 
none	 that its with you  sam what does it do  liam makes it harder for him to die it was mollys  marisha im going to go to caleb when he gets back knocking caleb caleb caleb  liam wheres my owl  marisha oh right it doesnt drown its amazing its like its magic or something we had  good times  liam you have three or four more days if you want  marisha do i  liam yeah i  marisha can you do me a favor  matt pocketed  marisha pocket owl right next 
none	 to my bacon  liam iowl  marisha i got this red feather from nila and i dont know when she handed it to me she was  like very deliberate on how she handed it to me will you just see if its magic  liam you want to know if this is something do you have a moment  marisha yeah  liam okay i will cast identify on this  matt it is not magical it is sentimental  liam ja thats a feather thats just a feather its good looking though  marisha tie it to 
none	 my staff im not disappointed  liam okay  marisha im not disappointed  liam are you good  marisha im bye im going to go to bed  laura can i pull out sprinkle  matt okay as you reach back into your waterlogged hood of your coat you hear this tiny  little coughing and there you pull out this extremely waterlogged and unhappy crimson weasel  chittering and coughing  laura youre so tough sprinkle im going to squish his little cheeks  matt he pees in your hand  laura oh thank you okay go right 
none	 to your stay there dont drown okay then im going to  look for beau but shes not around so then im going to go look for nott  sam im drinking  matt and laura where are you drinking  sam i dont know where are we all staying in the room or do we have a couple of rooms  matt there are three rooms between the group i think that have been given to you and the people  that have been moved to the mistake  sam lets say that im drinking on the deck of 
none	 the ship  laura oh good i was on the deck of the ship too how perfect hey nott  sam hi  laura hi are you super wasted  sam ive got a good buzz on  laura okay i have a question for you  sam yeah  laura have you i mean i think you have because you said you were like into somebody before have  you ever kissed a boy  sam hmm  marisha that was the cutest  liam its pretty cute  sam ive kissed a boy  laura yeah what was 
none	 it like  sam excuse me  laura what was it like when you kissed him  sam have you never kissed someone  laura no well  sam youre related your mom is a master of sexuality  laura i was asking what it was like when you kissed someone thats all  sam because you havent done it  laura well i didnt know if it counted  sam oh well what was the situation  laura i was drowning  sam oh you mean today oh  laura does that count though  sam okay well i 
none	 mean lets take a look at this your lips pressed against each others  laura yes  sam it meant something  laura yeah  sam how did it make you feel  laura like i wasnt dead  sam yeah alive that is the feeling did it make your heart beat faster than you know being  completely stopped how it was  laura yeah i think so i mean its not dead  sam if i had to do my first kiss over again i would want all of those things  laura really  sam yes thats 
none	 the best first kiss its someone you care about  laura well i didnt know if it counted  sam it means something youll remember it forever  laura i will i will remember the after part of it you know  sam oh yes  laura i was a little struggling in the beginning part  sam well yes afterwards i dont know if you felt this way you just cant stop thinking about  it and you just feel the soft pressing against you and almost taste him just for a little bit and it  doesnt go 
none	 away for a while  laura i think his tusks are growing back  sam you felt a little  laura just a little bit of tusk  sam ooh  laura yeah what was your first kiss like though  sam it wasnt as romantic it was just a dare  laura oh really  sam yes  laura with who  sam i dont know just someone i dont even remember too much  laura thats weird you said you never forget it  sam i sure did it was just you know i was pretty young and 
none	 kids just saying like oh you  kiss each other and you kiss each other now just one of those types of games  laura i think kids do that sort of stuff a lot  sam i think so too but i dont remember his name  laura oh do you remember the softness of his lips  sam i do yes it was a good day  laura yeah todays pretty cool too  sam well do you think things will change now between you  laura oh no i mean he might have a big crush on 
none	 me now you know  sam are you interested  laura oh i dont know you know  sam well sometimes boys like why am i telling you all this your moms a lady of the night  laura yeah i know  sam sometimes boys like it if you are a little bit aloof a little bit cold to them afterwards  like maybe they did something wrong and they dont even know what it was  laura really  sam yes  laura like the play the games  sam yes just a little bit of like just 
none	 keep them guessing like did i say something did i do  something was i a bad kisser  laura okay  sam that would put him on the defensive where you want him  laura thats right  sam then you cut his throat and fucking kill him im just kidding about all that i dont know  laura okay because i dont want to do that  sam no of course not hes our friend  laura okay well all right have fun with your flask okay  sam all right i will  laura im going to 
none	 go write in my journal  sam have fun drawing  laura okay  matt as everyone concludes their evening activities the journey looking at the map and  the distance is about 800 miles to darktow from urukayxl  taliesin intones theme from pirates of the caribbean  matt yeah essentially the ship normally  liam jesus christ  sam we should solve this at some point right we should get some bean bags or something  laura we should probably just rotate it maybe if you would roll it the other direction it  straightens it out did 
dung	 you know that  marisha put in under my okay  matt now its not centered whatever its fine you guys deal with your map its not mine its  your map do what you want not my responsibility your ship is actually traveling faster than it  normally was as part of the blessing that avantika received it can achieve about 55 miles  sam an hour  matt no an entire day of travel which is a bit faster than a general sailing ship which is why  the mistake can go faster but theyre a pair youre 
none	 looking at about 14 days of travel  marisha to darktow  matt to darktow yeah  marisha 14 days  matt welcome to being on the open seas man  marisha oh shit  matt they dont have bullet trains in dd you have 11 days of supplies there will have to be  some sort of supply stop or a way of handling that  taliesin i have a thing called create food and water  laura i do too  taliesin we can mix it up with the normal food so it doesnt taste as bad  
none	 matt that is going to make this journey not an issue when it comes to supplies look at that  singsong divine magic  taliesin teamwork  matt you dont have to stop then all right great  taliesin so sorry we just burned an entire encounter like yeah fuck whatever matthew made  sam is food and water the only thing we need do we need any other supplies to make this trip i  dont know  matt not to get to darktow at darktow there will be repairs made to the other ship and  possibly some 
none	 small repairs to the ship for its journey and any other supplies you would need  while there its a 14 day journey at full speed during this time a couple of things one you  guys can decide to if you want to learn how to run a boat  marisha i would like that very much  matt that being the case we get to decide what types of skill sets you want to pick up on out  here in the ocean that being the case we have the quartermaster quartermaster is the one who  has 
none	 the most authority other than the captain of the ship they take over if the captain is unable  to they divvy up plunder or whenever you board a prized vessel they decide what to take and what  to leave they generally helm that whole process there as far as pirate ships are concerned there  is the navigator or the sailing master  liam dibs  matt you do have orly hired to do that for you but orly can also train one of you to be a backup  in case orly  taliesin i was about 
none	 to say anything like being able to go by the stars or otherwise is something  i might be able to do very well  matt you can both train under him if you want to you can overlap  laura you do have memory  liam i know which direction is north at all times i dont forget anything im real smart  ingame  taliesin fair  liam just in the game  taliesin just lording that rap battle over me okay thats fine  matt we have the boatswain boatswain is in charge of the ship itself 
none	 you know keeping it in  top shape for travel and battle they handle looking over the wood the canvas the ropes  making sure that everythings solid and functional they lead shore parties for supplies  and repairs and oversee activities like dropping and weighing the anchor setting the sails  cleaning the deck things like that start thinking of things you might be interested in  theres the cooper which makes and maintains barrels for storage food and water theres the  carpenter which is the one that actually repairs the ships structural integrity when it takes  
none	 damage they answer to the boatswain they keep the hull the masts and the yardarms functional  theres the master gunner who organizes the placement of shot powder the fuse and aiming the  ships cannons all right so notts going to want to train as the master gunner and of  course powder monkey which is the next one below who basically runs all the stuff  sam powder monkey  matt powder monkey  sam maybe ill apprentice as that first  matt apprentice as powder monkey and should it be needed youll become hopefully a good master 
none	  gunner those are the most important aspects everyonell learn a little bit about sailing as  you go but start getting an idea if you want to right now which one of those youd want to  specifically begin to focus on  laura what does the boatswain do again  sam manager of the ship like the office manager right keeps it running  matt yeah makes sure that all the canvas the ropes the wood everythings in good condition  travis i have experience being a quartermaster so ill do that as well  laura oh okay 
none	  sam he said quartermaster not boatswain  laura i guess ill do the boatswain stuff i feel like ill be really bad at it  matt well find out train as the boatswain which actually to that point the next morning  as everyone begins to go about the first real day out here in the lucidian ocean clear blue sky  with dappled bits of cloud around you the smell of sea salt and foam and spray making its way as  it splashes across the front of the bow avantika catches up to you with vera being 
none	 called up to the  side she goes vera if youd be so kind i would like to call lets say the utmost members  of the crew please to the deck maybe some of your friends as well  travis of course ill bring them up  matt as you all gather on the deck avantika goes i appreciate all of the hard work youve  put into this my crew and yours as we are making our way back it is important that we properly  balance as we endeavor here and make sure that both training that 
none	 has been inquired about is  properly disseminated and out of curiosity and with no disrespect to you vera i will be  replacing you as the ships quartermaster until we return to darktow with our captain tusktooth  vera looks taken aback and briefly offended and then but of course my captain quartermaster  time to start paying attention  travis indeed  matt she begins to divvy out responsibilities to the rest of you in the various positions that you  requested to start learning some elements of the journey have you moving over to the mistake some 
none	  have you moving back especially for the repairs elements whoever decides they want to be the  carpenter unless none of you want to thats up to you  sam youre strong  laura im strong maybe i should be the carpenter  sam do you have any  laura ive got no  sam and laura nothing  matt its up to you  marisha what was that cooper position barrels  matt makes and maintains barrels  sam hey youve been around barrels your whole life  marisha i already know how to make a barrel  
none	 laura do you want to be the boatswain  taliesin i was thinking the one where you actually have to go out and find supplies i might  be really good at that  matt that is the boatswain  taliesin yeah ill take the boatswain  laura okay then ill do the carpenter  matt there we go note that somewhere on your character that those are the positions youre  training on this journey all right cooper got it  marisha making barrels  sam im the gunner well the powder monkey  matt powder monkey for now 
tavern	  sam for now working my way up  matt a few days into this journey well say because youre training as the carpenter  laura yes  matt jester the mistake is keeping in time with the squalleater and youre brought it slows down  a bit and youre brought over to the opposite side and there looking around you wander under the  deck and find at one of the tables waldok whos one of the deckhands of the ship hes currently  sitting at a table with a large tankard of really rough grog or ale biting 
none	 his lower lip and he  has his sleeve pulled up and you can see orly has this unique bowstring of some kind thats wrapped  between two fingers an inkwell and a needle thats tied up in it and hes currently halfway  through doing this really goodlooking elaborate tattoo across the arm of this deckhand  laura whoa  matt hes got his patch over his eye right up against one of the portholes where the lights  coming through and hes using it for perspective and hes lording over this smaller thin human  and glances over 
none	 oh hey there  laura can i go stand over his shoulder and stare at what hes doing  matt yeah you keep watch and hes doing this curled mermaid that is coming up and on one hand  is holding on at the hip and the other is picking a fruit off of a tree you begin to question the  design a bit and orly says offhand its what he requested  laura why are you having a mermaid pick fruit if shes in the water  matt hes sitting there going like grunting well i had a 
none	 rough fight with some scurvy a few  years back and a few things i like the idea of ladies in the sea that can save me from scurvy  laura oh thats really smart its very meaningful  matt orly chuckles under his breath its very well done and you can see now the other tattoos  that are across his body were probably done by him on himself  laura hey orly im training to be a carpenter did you know  matt i wasnt aware actually but mmmaybe you should ask around for the man whos doing 
none	 the  repairs around this place  laura yeah i will definitely do that but i also want to learn how to do tattoos can you teach me that  matt i can try and teach you some of  laura im a really good artist orly  matt  mmmy skills however i got a specific talent with some of this here  laura yeah its a thing that you wrap around your fingers and then you go like this  matt kind of here do you mmmind the guys like uh  laura im a really good artist 
none	 dont worry  matt sure orly helps show you how he threads this and gets the needle set up go ahead and make  a performance check  travis oh god  liam oh jeez  marisha performance  laura performance oh no performance  matt well say dexterity if you really want to  laura yeah ill do dexterity oh 17  matt 17 picking up where the initial partial ink sketches were you actually continue to fill in  the rest of the upper torso you do a very good job you can see where the style does 
none	 shift in the  art but its not abrasive it just continues and it is rather nice  laura do you think maybe your mermaid would want some googly eyes  matt he goes um no i appreciate that but no  laura are you sure i think itd really make her look really good  matt he starts to pull his arm away from you orly puts his giant tortle hand on your shoulder  and goes i dont recommend mmmessing with the artistic vision  laura i understand i dont want people messing with my artistic vision either 
none	  matt there you are  laura you and me orly were going to be fast friends  matt i like the idea of that point of order  laura did you say porn of order  matt point of order  laura okay  matt you dont happen to have any sort of gem dust do you  laura gem dust like a gem thats been powdered  matt yeah  laura or like ink  matt oh i have plenty of ink its mmmore  laura wait are you trying to make a sparkly ink  matt mmmore 
none	 or less  laura i mean i dont have any powdered gems but i could probably powder some gems  matt i picked up this technique years ago from some of the individuals that spawned from the  legacy of the island folk it allows me to instill a mmmighty ink spot as he does that he flexes  his arm and the tattoo shimmies every so slightly and his muscles bulge a bit  laura oh my god will you teach me how to do that if i give you some dust  matt see its not so much 
none	 something that can be easily taught more that its something bequeathed  by an elder  laura do you want to bequeath me  matt no  laura what if you really like me though  matt well see how time goes by for the time being just let me know if i can be of service  he talks to you about it and he gives you an overview of his capabilities for different types  of gem dust he can imbue somebody with a series of tattoos that can alter elements of their  physical self its not 
none	 inexpensive and each person can only have it once ever so its not  like you can have multiple for 2200 gold worth of a ruby dust he can imbue a permanent 1 to strength  travis what  exclamations  matt for 2200 gold worth of emerald dust he can do a permanent 1 to dex he runs down the stat  sheet there the most expensive ones constitution thats 2500 worth of diamond dust  there are all the different gem types there he can also imbue certain resistances those are more  expensive those are 5000 gold 
none	 worth of fire opal dust for fire resist and 5000 gold worth of black  sapphire dust for cold resist he has the capability of imbuing essentially magical  permanent tattoos  laura that is amazing  marisha i have a jewelers kit pigeon cooing  laura oh my gosh  marisha beau made jewelry pigeon cooing  travis thats a shitload of jewels  matt yeah thats something  laura thats a lot of jewels  sam we have some though  laura yeah we have some  taliesin some stuff that we dont want to get rid of 
none	  laura yeah  marisha i want some magic tattoos  laura oh my gosh do they shimmer though do look sparkly on your body do they look shiny  matt you can see aspects of based on what enchantment it is like on orly his is  specifically an aquamarine dust it has this faint aquamarine light blue shimmy to it as  soon as the light hits it it glitters across  laura gasping  travis oh fuck  matt aquamarine dust being the one that boosts charisma  laura orly youre so charismatic  matt laughs mmmany 
none	 folk have said that  laura i would definitely want to learn this from you and i probably once i get a little more rich  and i have some powdered gems im going to have you do it to me  matt well looks like youre just going to have to keep me employed for quite a while  laura yeah dont get hurt okay  matt dont get me hurt he goes back to finishing up the tattoo on the individual  laura okay what was the guys name that was getting a tattoo  matt that was 
none	 waldok  laura waldok well waldok ill see you later  matt grunts okay  laura im going to go carpenter some stuff  matt all right  marisha holy shit  matt roughly eight days into this journey youve moved about 100 miles off the shore of the  southern island of bwuali when a small horn sound goes off on the squalleater horn call its a  small horn its a very small horn  laura i had a flashback  matt i know this wasnt meant to be an epic horn that i totally failed on this 
none	 is intentionally a  small horn glancing at the top you can see avantika has climbed to the center of the mainmast  and towards one of the crows nests up top and looking down points to you fjord and goes  quartermaster call two of your compatriots that you trust to the top with me  travis will do jester deuce  taliesin yeah  travis up top  taliesin oh yeah i like it up there  matt you guys climb up the mainmast to the crows nest and there you see avantika with a spyglass  and 
none	 she leans in to the three of you directing mainly towards fjord and goes now that we are  at sea i want to show you something she pulls out the spyglass and holds it over to you and  helps you point it in the direction here you see a vessel a little ways off on the horizon a  little bit north of where you are a northwestward direction she whispers over your shoulder so the  rest of you can hear glancing at this ship ahead of us it appears to be a concord ship a shipping 
none	  vessel probably carrying trade goods it appears to be equipped for rapid travel but we could head  it off as my quartermaster i ask you for your opinion what should we do  travis well im sure its a ship of innocents we dont want to stray from our path correct  matt take a look what do you see  travis ill use the spyglass  matt make a perception check  sam theyre torturing orphans on the deck  travis 20  matt okay glancing at it its a pretty well made ship its meant for 
none	 speed it doesnt appear  to be heavily manned its not carrying or transporting people it doesnt seem to be a  transport ship of any means you see a handful of small sailors on board with a hand crossbow or a  saber thats sheathed at the side you see on the deck a handful of crates that were not kept  beneath which means its probably pretty wellpacked it does appear to be concord colors  since its traveling southward you gather its probably recently finished especially with your  experience as a sailor finished stocking up on 
none	 all its materials travel supplies and its goods  based on the path its heading southward its either going to arc around to taldorei or be  heading in the direction of marquet or possibly if its feeling risky the shattered teeth  travis captain are you in a habit of intercepting said vessels in your time at sea  matt depends if we can do so quickly without losing any sort of momentum perhaps not all  ships are boarded and there is a loss of life most id say probably 80 percent of encounters  out here is 
none	 just intimidation most let us take what we want and continue on our way they dont  want to die  travis its important that you know in my previous life i had encounters with pirating  vessels as well and most of those experiences i did not enjoy  matt well to be fair there are plenty of assholes on these waters so it does not surprise  me but it is your choice i say you may talk amongst your friends but there is opportunity  travis you say no need for a loss of life  matt 
none	 not unless they how do you say they are stupid  travis or stubborn  matt either or  travis well my fellow boatswain and navigators to be nope boatswain and carpenter yeah  laura im a carpenter fjord im learning to be a carpenter  travis okay carpenter and  laura and a really good tattoo artist  travis what are you  taliesin a boatswain  travis oh well i had that completely fucking backwards  i take real good notes what say you on such a dangerous expedition as this  taliesin may i  travis oh 
none	 yes of course  taliesin im going to take a look at this thing  matt make a perception check  taliesin 22  matt okay you make out the same details as he does nothing catches your attention nothing  about it seems out of the ordinary per se but it does seem to be a vessel that is filled with its  payload and making its way south  laura let me see  matt make a perception check  laura only because i would totally do it if they were both looking and i rolled like shit 
none	 i think  theres a ship  travis youre not wrong  taliesin obviously the decision is yours but we are low on supplies which means we have more to  lose if something goes wrong we lose vital members of our crew or burn through magic ability  were going to be without food whereas im sure theyre probably very well stocked and prepared  for these sorts of eventualities i feel like we would be coming in from a place of weakness  thats my initial thought  travis jester  laura oh man i dont know id 
none	 be okay with it i guess  travis youre up for a scrap on the seas  laura well it doesnt have to be a scrap like avantika said it could be you know go in and  take stuff but maybe we could also give them something  travis what would we give them  laura i dont know like new names or pretty drawings  taliesin fine art  laura yeah we could just make it a fun time for them  matt an aggressive trade interesting  travis very well  matt what is your decision  
none	 travis as long as we abstain as well as we can from violence and as long as your men in the crew  understand my disgust at such tactics i think we can make our way towards an intercept  matt you watch as this playful look on her face as she watches this discourse turns into this  extremely intense jokerlike grin and she goes well then welcome to piracy my friends come  she jumps off the side and heads the ropes down and begins shouting off commands to people on the ship  taliesin i think that 
none	 escalated rather quickly  laura she made me question what we just did i thought it was one thing and then her face made me  think its a whole other thing  travis well you said we need supplies right  taliesin well i said that we were in a position of disadvantage  travis i felt like your words were different before listen were going to not use violence  all right im not  matt the sails shift as the ropes are being pulled  travis do me a favor spread the word amongst the rest of 
none	 us and make sure the rest of the crew  hears as well i dont want innocent blood shed if it can be helped  laura i mean whatever fjord i guess we can do that if you want to i dont care  travis thank you jester  laura im already down im not there anymore  matt all right  taliesin i feel like this is somehow connected to your previous bad decisions  marisha aw shit  travis nope is the big ogre  matt bouldergut  travis yes that name  matt yes bouldergut is on 
none	 this ship she has been moved from the mistake partially because  bouldergut acts as a bodyguard to avantika and because the other ship itself is in serious need  of repairs they assume probably dont put the giant heavy ogre on it  travis can i find bouldergut  matt sure enough bouldergut is down there currently getting ready with a giant great club  that is carved from an older masthead  travis bouldergut  matt what  travis im sure that is just for show yes  matt right for show  travis its important you understand 
none	 i have an agreement with the captain no unnecessary  bloodshed you will make sure that the rest of the men know this  matt she looks back and avantika goes oh dont worry you are the quartermaster you are the one  who is to be boarding any sort of ships that we encounter so you choose your people  travis uncertain noises i know making sure you know that is all  taliesin in my imagination that felt vaguely like a threat  matt at this point you watch as ipess who is the second mate of the 
none	 ship this sunburned gnome  begins scurrying up the rope to go ahead and put their flag on display ipess ipess  taliesin what does the flag look like  matt the flag on this is a dull gray purple color and it has a similar sketch of the same eye tattoo  that avantika has on her chest  taliesin all right  matt as that goes up and the ship begins to move to intercept glancing through the eyeglass in the  distance you can see the other ship noticing the approach and there is now a bunch 
none	 of chaos as they  all begin running up and down the ship notifying everybody else on there what are you doing to  prepare guys  travis im running to find nott our master gunnerintraining ill say nott i need you to  keep an eye on those guns were not looking  sam shouting all right you motherfuckers i need hollow charges loaded i need extra fuses on  every motherfucking cannon get me hollow shells loaded with extra charges i want four cannonballs  on every cannon move  travis nott nott oh my god look again 
none	 were not looking to sink this ship okay were going to  try and board get what we need and let them go i dont want unnecessary violence  marisha i run in with a keg of black powder that ive been building shouting are we fighting  sam shouting yeah  marisha shouting is this a fight  sam shouting light them up load them up put the charges at the ready  marisha shouting whos trying to punk our ass  sam shouting short fuses  marisha okay  matt the angry tough redbearded dwarf that actually acts 
none	 as the cannon master of the ship  that goes by the name of ophiscan duth im interested in possibly getting involved but this  is too much fun to watch keep going goblin im liking it  sam shouting if youre not going to help stand out of my way  marisha all right ive got five pounders eight pounders 12 pounders short fuses and a 20 pound keg  matt two of the other deckhands who act as powder monkeys are also helping get things organized  marisha what are we doing whats going on  travis were 
none	 doing great beau youre going to join me as we pull alongside the ship  marisha okay  travis youre part of the boarding party go up above  marisha okay  travis nott i pull nott close and i say if you fucking fire on that ship before they fire on us  you will never get into the academy do you understand  sam the academy  travis yeah  marisha so were not fighting  travis the letter that i have that grants me access  sam oh  travis if you want that for caleb  
none	 sam oh i see  travis so act real tough and yell real loud dont fire on them unless they fire on us you understand  matt though i would recommend if youre going to fire do a warning shot tends to get them a bit  spooked in their boots and slowing down  sam so a warning shots okay  matt across the bow not at the ship in front of it away from it but just enough to show a  little bit of power  sam to me it seems like the closer the more intimidating 
none	 right  matt theres a bit of a range of error with these weapons theyre not a perfect art  sam so dont fire at them  travis as long as you dont hit the ship  sam all right  travis im sure youll  sam shouting come on you motherfuckers get ready to fire  matt at this point the sails are fully unfurled speed is picking up the other ship was trying to  gain speed and it is a very fast ship but as it tries to move away it ends up putting you at a 
none	  parallel pace at which point the master gunner leans into you and goes ahem about now would be  fine i think  sam to fire  matt we want them to slow down eh  sam all right im so excited im just going to take a swig  matt he gets behind you and not quite like making the vase in ghost but is trying to help  show you exactly how to set things up and get the cannon ready and aim it  sam are you with us  travis im going to leave you 
none	 to it im going back upstairs  sam okay ill cast a quick message and say fjord im about to fire my warning shot good to go you  can respond to this message  travis at your will yeah  sam all right i will light the fuse i dont know how you do it  taliesin powder ball make ready fire  matt powder place the shot put the fuse in aim then fire  sam okay do i have to roll for this  matt yeah go ahead and make an intelligence check  sam okay thats 
none	 a natural one  laura oh no  taliesin im so excited  liam what the fuck  matt okay  sam ready aim  travis the cannon goes creaking  matt you light the fuse  sam fire  matt sizzling  sam what happened whats going on  matt what order did you put them in  sam i put the fuse in first and then i put the powder in and then one of the balls is that right  matt i dont think thats how  sam maybe i did them  matt i think you 
none	 fucked it up  sam i think i did the ball first and then the powder  matt i think thats right were going to have to clean that cannon  sam shit  matt youre going to have to clean that cannon  sam lets go to another cannon  matt all right well move over to this one so you begin setting up the other cannon  sam uhhuh  matt so you put the powder first put the ball get the explosion the other cannon goes off  taliesin at least you werent looking in it  
none	 matt theres a shaking sound with splintering wood and a bit of smoke in the vicinity you  glance over and that cannon is fucked  laura i come running in do i need to fix a hole  sam its not wood but sure  liam caleb runs up from under the deck with sulfur in one hand and bat shit in the other one  what is going on what is this  sam sorry  liam what are we doing  sam technical difficulties  marisha can somebody please tell us what the fuck is going on 
none	  taliesin we are apparently committing an act of piracy  matt at this point ophiscan sees this and knowing your skill set goes go back upstairs theres a  lot of powder in this room  liam arent weoh oh  matt upstairs  liam youre good  matt fireboy go go get  sam i was born to do this  matt all right so you owe us a cannon try again  laura i use the cantrip mending  matt well see if that would help a destroyed cannon  laura probably not  matt thats a 
none	 lot of material  liam i could fix it  matt a single break or tear no that cannons fucked  laura one little thing goes squeaking  matt all right try it again the dc is lower this time because now youve fucked up  sam ive got this are they getting away  matt youve managed to head them off theyre managing to get speed and theyre curving this way  and you guys are curving to meet them  travis theyre curving fast because there was a detonation  matt yeah  sam okay thats better intelligence 
none	 check 20 couldnt be more different  matt without issue this time proper order with a rapid pace halfway through ophiscans like eh sorry  sam hey back off old man  matt you set it light the fuse explosion the whole thing lurches back about two feet and  theres a large wooden platform that catches it from the impact the room shakes for a second and  you glance through the little side of the gunport and you watch it hit the water maybe about 40 feet  out from the front of the other ship you hear 
none	 shouting from the other ship and you watch as it  starts to slow and come to a slower crawl it begins to give up its chase  sam i cast message fjord mission accomplished board at will you can respond to this message  travis well done nott  laura oh my gosh  sam oh boy  matt this is more for just a visual perspective  marisha just for visuals  sam you guys if you live in the uk youre going to get some faster cheaper shipping  marisha way cheaper  sam of the art 
none	 book  marisha uhhuh because books are heavy  sam which going to be available what day  laura monday at nine  sam this is exciting but also dd beyond  laura whoa matthew mercer so cool  sam you made those  matt well no this was sent to me by fans of the show who actually make these and then this i had  custom made a while back in case this ever came around  sam does this ship have a grid printed on it or carved into it  matt yeah lasered in just to 
none	 give you perspective as you guys pull up from the side of  this eventually the two ships are brought in anchor is dropped  laura which one is ours  matt this is yours here this is the squalleater on the opposite end the crew has all  moved up to the deck they have weapons at the ready but not necessarily ready to fire theyre  in the process of realizing they dont have much recourse at this moment the rest of avantikas  crew or at least a number of them have come up on the deck 
none	 in support but youre the one whos  helming this what do you do  travis i look over at caleb caleb have you any desire to intimidate some folks  liam do you need that yeah okay  taliesin do we have a name of this ship  travis beaus going with  matt the squalleater oh their ship  liam she is intimidating  laura hey fjord you know sometimes you can be nice to people too and make them think that they  are friends  travis yeah i dont know thats not where im going beau 
none	  marisha yeah  travis team up with bouldergut i want you to go on the opposite ship and find me the captain  marisha okay  travis can i see how many men now that were close how many are above deck  matt yes to give you kind of a brief perspective here what you see on deck off to the side those  are the people you see some of them appear to be deckhands and arent armed aside from a small  shortsword on their side a couple of them appear to be a little better 
none	 dressed but none of them  are warriors they dont appear to have a very visible guard on the deck of the ship  travis okay sorry i didnt mean to interrupt  matt no go ahead  travis im coming with you just keep an eye out and make sure no one is doing any shifty biz  marisha and you want no violence here whatsoever  travis not unless rules of engagement apply do not fire or attack unless fired upon  taliesin do you want me to make an announcement maybe  travis yes  taliesin thaumaturgy 
none	 im going to project my voice very loudly onto the other ship  matt okay  taliesin fellow friends at sea we wish to have a parlay with your captain and we hope to keep this  entire confrontation as bloodless and reasonable as humanly possible we will do our best to be  civil and not encourage anything inappropriate over the next several minutes we would appreciate  your cooperation in this direction then im going to try and make all the doors open and available  to us from the other ship with thaumaturgy as well im going 
none	 to pop all their doors open  matt soon as that sentence comes to an end you hear a rapid clattering of heavy wood against  wood its all of the various ports and doors in the interior of the ship all manage to slam open  at once all the members on the opposite side look at each other make an intimidation check  taliesin what number is that i have a number in that lets see what it does thats a 22  matt a 22 they all look at each other and begin to back even further 
none	 away from the edge one of  them rushes down and goes deeper into the ship and a moment later returns with one figure which  appears to be better dressed than the others you see very bright blonde hair and a relatively  welldressed leather tunic over decent captains clothing he comes to the front and goes i am  the captain of the stormcap who am i to be parlaying with  travis ill step forward and reach for gloves that arent there and not do that my name is  fjord im a representative of the squalleater 
none	 here if you will but humor us for a few moments  im afraid were very short on supplies we need to replenish our stores and perhaps enrich our  pockets if your men behave im sure we will all get out of this very little worse for wear  matt i am captain jules errog of the stormcap and i would very much like the lives of my men  spared what supplies do you need perhaps there can be a trade organized  travis indeed deuce food water  taliesin definitely food and water we are also in 
none	 the need of some gems if possible ill also  say that if they require any healing at all for anybody that might be sickly on the ship id be  happy to offer my services  travis oh indeed yes the well being of your men obviously was something that we would easily tend to  matt his expression gets really confused its like okay  marisha whats captain avantika doing right now  matt avantika is on the other ship just leaning against the opposite side watching this happen  just keeping an eye on everything  travis 
none	 now in exchange for our good will in this interaction im sure you wont mind if we peruse  below decks and see if there is anything of interest  matt looks across to the rest of his men looks over towards you again  taliesin im by the way human looking right now  matt okay  taliesin smeed  matt the intimidating thaumaturgycasting smeed okay do as you will  travis fantastic bouldergut ill call the ogre up to just board their ship and stay on the  gangplank between ours and theirs  matt bouldergut takes a 
none	 step towards the gangplank and goes grrr looks over at avantika  who shouts perhaps not having her on the plank is a good idea  travis oh no im sorry on their ship on that side of the gangplank  matt bouldergut backs up and does a running jump and hits the other side and you watch the ship  shift in the water from the impact and the weight of this ogre so now you have that  travis our friend here is going to play chaperone and ensure everyone stays nice and happy up here  beau 
none	 would you mind coming with me  marisha yeah absolutely  taliesin let us know if you need anything  travis will do again i must emphasize no tricky business were in good moods it would be  smart to keep it that way  liam i fire off a fire bolt straight up into the sky in an arc over and let it land in the ocean  matt a fire bolt  liam yeah a fire bolt you dont want us to be unhappy  matt make an intimidation check  liam 11  matt okay the captain 
none	 thinks to himself and nods he turns and steps aside from the doorway  that hes been standing in  travis i motion to a third so its not just beau and myself one of the other crew members of the  squalleater to come with us downstairs  matt okay at your disposal right there would probably be vera who is the previous  quartermaster but she is a bit older not quite geriatric but is in her older years  sam cooing yasha  marisha were trying to go with squalleater people waldok  travis vera ipess  
none	 marisha ipess or waldok  matt vera ipess or norgul vera norgul is her name who are you calling  travis yeah lets have ipess come  matt a giant bushy bearded gnome comes by and he has his shortsword drawn all right lets do it  lead on the three of you make it across the gangplanks and now the group is four of you  including bouldergut the large opening that leads down into the ship the rest  marisha where is the captains quarters  matt the captains quarters is underneath in the back  marisha be 
none	 right back im going to go into the captains quarters  matt okay as you head down almost everybody whos on the ship is up top you see a few figures  that are deckhands cowering in rooms theyre scared shitless and when you begin walk past you  hear shushing theyre trying to stay quiet youre in the captains quarters what are you doing  marisha im looking for any type of important paperwork correspondence what these guys are  traveling logs  matt make an investigation check  liam also when you are down there you hear in 
none	 the back of your skull books  marisha and books frumpkin what are you doing i put frumpkin on my shoulder i rolled a natural  19 so 24  matt a number of shipping ledgers there are books keeping tabs on payments to the crew and how  long theyve been hired there is one paper you do find that is hidden in a locked compartment  beneath but you manage to find underneath this little bit that you can slip your fingers through  and pull a sheet of paper out on the opposite end of the shelf 
none	 this is a list of the supplies on  the ship  marisha anything of interest  matt there is food and water for the journey there are clovis concord spices menagerie coast  specialty dried meats tropical fruits that are specifically frozen and brought so theyre slowly  thawing through the journey to get them as fresh as they can where theyre going this looks like  this journey was intended to go to marquet to port damali the bay of gifts amongst all the  various bits of general supplies cloths clothing and silks that are specific to 
none	 the  menagerie coast there are some elements of empire goods as well that are put in there but the thing  that catches your interest there is one last addition everything else seems to be written in  one type of handwriting and there is a different type of handwriting in the final entry and the  final entry says requested package guarded and the amount that was paid for that was 1800  gold that was received by the captain on this ledger to keep on the down low  marisha im going to immediately look around do 
none	 i see any of the safes where you would hide a  guarded package in here  matt in here you do not not within this chamber  marisha all right i go meet fjord and norgul nope ipess thats whos with us i go meet them  matt okay while youre looking are you waiting for beau or are you heading out  travis yeah we go together  matt beau joins up with you guys  travis whatd you find  marisha oh an entire inventory of the ship that looks interesting  travis oh yes indeed it 
none	 does  marisha who wants to ask about that  travis oh i believe i will  matt actually as high your investigation check was and you continued investigation into the room  in search of any sort of thing you do not find this package but you do find underneath under the  small tossed somewhat mildewed rugs that mark the floor there is a section of floorboard that  pulls open and there is a small chest that is locked when you pull and shake it a bit its  filled with quite a bit of coin  
none	 marisha i grab the whole chest is it heavy  matt its pretty heavy  marisha i grab the whole chest grunting  travis nice first room  marisha yeah thats pretty good feel pretty proud of that  travis yeah thats real good  marisha do you think this is the shipment think this is that would i deduce this is that or no  matt as you are moving and shifting it it sounds like its filled with a lot of coin  marisha theres a different package here  travis well im going to find out one 
none	 way ill call over bouldergut bouldergut do me a favor  and lob this over onto the other ship would you  matt bouldergut grabs it with one hand and walks over as bouldergut makes her way onto the deck  you can see the captain notice it and sigh loudly  travis i know captain i hate to be more of an inconvenience than this already is and i want to  get the stormcap on its way as quickly as possible would you do me a favor and have all of  your men come down here and 
dung	 assemble at the bow of the ship please this is getting too interesting  and i cant have you spread out all over the place  matt men please to the bow of the ship they all begin to shift and make their way that  direction as the captain begins to move goes all i ask please is leave enough supplies for  us to make our journey  travis but of course captain what are we monsters  matt does not break eye contact with you and gives you a serious dark glare  liam i start lobbing 
none	 fire bolts into the sea like im skipping stones every ten or 15 seconds  matt it certainly keeps the other side nervous  laura im waving at them hi  travis well make our way below deck to see what we can see  matt you go past into the cargo hold which is below here on the level where the captains  quarters are and just below theres the rest of the cabin quarters for the rest of the crew and  then below that is the cargo hold as you make your way past the various hiding 
none	 other members of  the deckhand crew down in the lower cargo hold there are a series of crates and barrels that  contain all the supplies that were on the ledger you would assume all the different trade materials  travis ill peek my head into one of those rooms where the crew is hiding ill say you you and  you get your ass up i want these crates taken above deck and put on our ship do it quickly do  it quietly  matt which ones  travis ill point out the ones with the food 
none	 some of the water and some of those frozen fruits  as well for scurvy needs  matt okay theyre all trying to keep a distance from you scurry down and begin lifting  things at which point a voice below goes whats going on and they go shh they begin to move  things back up to the top  travis ill grab one of them before they i heard that  marisha i crack my knuckles behind fjord  travis you know if you were on the sea long enough you would know that im the type that 
none	 only  asks a question once who else is down here  matt make an intimidation check  travis 23  matt eyes wide the pupils gyrating in a very quick shaking motion i dont his name he came  with one of the pieces of cargo he just stays down there  travis that would be it you can go on  matt panting and continues to grab and pull the crates up  sam im going to cast message fjord we are reloaded and ready to fire if you want me to  fire literally reply with any 
none	 word you can reply to this message fuck  laughter  taliesin dont get greedy  travis well i dont feel like we need reinforcements for this right  marisha i feel deeply capable but i feel deeply capable  travis yasha  marisha yo yasha  matt from across the other side  marisha oh sorry shouting yasha  matt yes  marisha come here  matt bounds across the gangplank on the other side what do you need she heads down to the  ship with you  marisha think the secret package is a person think theres 
none	 a person think hes the secret  package because hes on this ledger and its different handwriting anyway lets go find the person  travis yeah well make our way further into the hold and try to find the source of the voice  taliesin just because everyones on the deck im going to do a quick detect magic and scan the boat  matt the whole boat  taliesin everybody in the boat  laura while hes doing that im going to say i need a volunteer  sam from the other crew  taliesin i will also say 
none	 im going to take it and that chest they just threw out as well  matt okay the chest does not emit a magical presence in order to really check the other ship  you have to go across onto its bow and scan and walk across it its a 30foot  taliesin its 30foot okay at the very least im going to get close and walk the oh yeah  matt okay as you begin to make your way over towards the bow concentrating on the spell a  tiny little magic source below you deep in the ship 
none	 catches your attention  laura in the other ship  matt in the other ship yes  taliesin theres something magic down below  matt while this is happening  sam i say that all the time to my lady friends by the way  matt you guys head down into the cargo hold  marisha super on edge and guarded  matt make a perception check  marisha darkvision goggles okay  travis i will aid you  marisha thank you i will take it oh my god i rolled a three and a four seven  matt okay 
none	 looking inside it is lightless and appears to be empty aside from the series of  crates and shipping containers that are in here other than the ones that youve had moved up to  the top between the three of them theyve done two quick upanddowns theyve brought a fair  amount of supplies so far and theyll continue if you tell them to  marisha i cant see shit but i dont trust it  travis i can  marisha you know maybe if i readjust let me just close my eyes for a second okay why dont 
none	  you try  travis yeah can i give it a better look with my darkvision  matt no because you spent your turn helping her  travis thats right im helping her of course  matt technically its both of you looking  liam okay caduceus aired the fact that he is a little nervous so i place my hand on caduceus  shoulder and then look through frumpkins eyes to see whats going on  taliesin im getting a little bit of magic down there i dont know what it is but its making me nervous  matt 
none	 okay looking through frumpkins eyes make a perception check  liam oh i wasnt trying to do a perception check im not searching for anything im just  checking in  matt youre just keeping an eye okay so youre just keeping tabs on the situation  liam thats exactly what i want to do  laura i just want to let it known that im asking for a volunteer from the other crew  taliesin oh god  laura i need a volunteer  matt they all look at each other  laura it can be anyone but there 
none	 should be at least one  matt the captain steps forward and goes for what  laura for a special present its a treat  matt make a persuasion check  sam that sounds awful  taliesin that sounds like the worst thing ever oh man  laura 17  sam a treat  matt go lieb that way  laura liam  matt lieb  laura lieb  matt i know so close one of the deck hands looks and he goes what me  laura come on  matt onto the squalleater  laura yeah come sit next 
none	 to me  matt he comes across the gangplank over next to you  laura i bust out the tattoo stuff that orlys been teaching me im going to give him a tat  while all thats going on  laughter  taliesin this is the darkest timeline oh  travis unmolested except for  taliesin and thats how i got this  laura where do you want it  taliesin im having bad flashbacks  matt hes just like i what  laura itll be so good its going to be so beautiful  sam this poor guy  
none	 marisha youve got to test on somebody  laura ooh i like it lets get your clothes open while everythings going on im just going  to spend  matt while youre prepping he just looks over at the captain very mournfully and the captains like  laura its just going to be one smiley line with two tusks sticking out of it  sam oh  taliesin vampire  laura youve been abducted no by captain tusktooth  matt make a dexterity check  marisha like youve been abducted congratulations  laura ooh 19  matt so over the 
none	 next ten minutes or so youll be able to provide a fine tattoo of that simple design  laura yeah just like a smiley face but with tusks  matt you got it hes biting his lip groaning  laura just deal with it its going to be good  travis ill make my way forward into the hold even though we havent seen much  matt okay you move ahead into the hold about ten feet or so theres a small pathway thats built  between all the different elements of crates and barrels making sure that you can 
none	 get to the back  of the hold  marisha plug sorry  matt theyre not a sponsor  marisha actually not sponsored  matt as you move around the corner in a flash you hear grunting you see this quick arc of  steel as suddenly from around the corner a fairly wellarmed man with sundarkened skin  short hair pulled into a tight topknot or a bun of some kind holding a longsword twohanded  swings at you three strikes that is 24 to hit  travis hits  matt that is 18 to hit  travis hits 
none	  matt and ooh that is a 26 to hit  travis misses  matt three hits there that is 16 points of slashing damage 13 points of slashing damage  and oh 18 points of slashing damage  travis amazing  liam i call out up there captain your quartermaster is under attack  laura how do you know that  marisha hes looking through frumpkin  laura oh cool  matt avantika listens and goes ah i trust he can take care of himself eh  taliesin you want to send me down  liam well see  
none	 taliesin all right  matt now i need you to roll initiative you to roll initiative and roll initiative for yasha  and ill do for bouldergut  marisha oh my god i dont know if i trust gil im sorry gil but i dont trust you 18 ill  take that 18  matt 25 to 20 beau youre 18  travis yasha rolled a 19  matt oh so yashas up first  travis i rolled a six  matt okay good to know yasha is up first seeing this flashing of blades across fjord fjord  gets 
none	 knocked back careening into some of the nearby crates they shift from the impact you  hear the cracking of wood as soon as the figure pulls back getting the blade into defensive  position backing up against a corner with that was set with a table and a chair and this is  essentially the guarding post of this figure below theres a very faint bit of light in the  corner from a hooded lantern thats been faced towards the inside of the crates so it wouldnt  give any sort of light that revealed his location you 
none	 see him going into a defensive position  yashas up first yasha  travis does he look armored  matt armored yes halfplate  travis with her bonus action she will rage and she will make two attacks with the magicians judge  matt go for it  travis thats not good thats an 11  matt 11 misses the blade scrapes across his armor no impact  travis and a 12  matt the first one scrapes across the armor causing a couple sparks to fly and briefly  lighting up his position the second time he actually pulls

none	 kind of a thing  marisha i mean we just had the full pirate experience that a travel agency could not provide  it was very authentic and that was amazing  taliesin youre hard to follow sometimes you know that  marisha huh  taliesin ah nothing just  travis nott id ask if you have any reservations but you seemed very enthusiastic  about todays  sam i was born to be a cannoneer  travis uhhuh i cant promise there will be a lot of that but at least i know that youre dtf  cool caleb 
none	  marisha down to fire  travis yep fire caleb how you doing  liam i mean this is a matter of survival if we do not cooperate shes going to kill us im not  opposed per se to what went down today but its not what i want to do with my life i would prefer  to break away from this woman but were here for you right now you are trying to figure out you  know your thing i think id like to hear from you what the longterm plan is are we on the 
none	  ship in the sea is that what youre after  travis yeah actually i do have some news to share avantika apparently has come across my old  mentor vandren before she knew him apparently he carried the same sword that i have its called  the sword of fathoms has a name shes of the opinion that he always carried on him the sword  and another one of those spheres an eye she asked me if i knew where the ship that i was on  went down i did recall the area and she believes that 
none	 if we were to search that shipwreck we might  find this third sphere she has the ability to mess with water now and in some of the dreams  ive been having i believe theres quite a bit more where that has come from  marisha still having those dreams then  travis not all the time i admit ive been very excited about all of this but the things i see  are world changing scary  marisha in a good way or a bad way  travis i dont know  marisha or is it dependent on 
none	 the operator  travis i dont know that either  liam what is the good scenario the good version of releasing a massive serpent onto  the menagerie coast  travis well when you say it like that i dont know i meant only the power that might come  before that happens  laura does the serpent get released if the little orbs are spread out amongst other people or do  they all have to be in one person  travis i  taliesin or three  travis i actually dont know im just assuming that because she 
none	 placed her sphere at the bottom  of that well in that temple there are two other temples which we have to do the same thing and  that might lead to the release of that serpent  marisha but you think that one of the others spheres is at the bottom of the shipwreck not  necessarily a temple  travis right the third sphere and i have the second  marisha but you  laura but doesnt she have two spheres  sam no she had one but she got rid of it fjord has one  marisha 
none	 fjord and he traded it for power  sam so it would good for us to get that last one so that she cant  laura what if she does get the last one  sam then we would have failed  marisha well at least she would be twice as powerful as fjord is one  travis it would be a lot for one person  marisha i mean theres also  sam she would want the third  marisha which is inside of you  sam which means she would want fjords body  travis correct can i 
none	 just take a second and ask caduceus to check the door  taliesin ive been paying very close attention and listening in to the hallway and trying to keep  a very  matt make a perception check  taliesin blows raspberry 15  matt okay it seems to be fairly clear  taliesin havent heard any footsteps or  matt no  sam look at the port window is there a port window  matt in the room youre in currently there is not a port window  travis without saying too much more i think its best that 
none	 we all listen to calebs words and play along  marisha uhhuh  travis well be making our way to darktow  marisha yeah  travis and then we will reevaluate  sam but the overall mission is to get dont say anything  travis just feel like and ill try and be subtle as possible that only the people in the  room would hear whispering there are people that we cant see i just dont feel like this is  the best place to converse  sam weve been feeling around the air  travis its not our 
none	 ship  taliesin i feel like for the time being it just might be best to be the best we can be here and  be as helpful as humanly possible our goals are relatively aligned and as long as we dont have to  hurt anybody im all right but the rest of these people  marisha do we whispering need more information  taliesin always  marisha whispering to find your ship  travis i think i would know the location based off the trade route  matt you know the general vicinity of where it would have 
none	 happened it would take a little bit of  searching and a little bit of you know  travis at the bottom of the fucking ocean  matt yeah depending on what you have at your disposal like definitely narrow the search but  if its just based on your memory it would take a while to find it but you know the general area  where it went down  marisha sotto i was debating heavily in watching avantika to see if with a distraction of trying  to board the pirate ship today that i can maybe sneak 
none	 into her office with the distraction but i  noticed she was very adamant holding back and watching the entire scenery it was not safe to go  into her quarters if we need to get into her office i think its going to have to be an  important enough and big enough distraction  laura maybe fjord you can like go seduce her or something then you know with the seduction  then whispers you can sneak into her office  sam some people give up information when theyve been seduced as well  travis mmhmm  sam 
none	 is that something you could do  travis all good ideas  laura it just seems like shes into you you know  sam i noticed that as well  travis trying to use that to our advantage  marisha whispers youre doing great  travis thanks i appreciate it im trying to keep her close if she starts to suspect us well  be in trouble if anyone feels uncomfortable with how things are going please let me know my  curiosity is not worth dying for or doing something you feel like youd regret i value what  
dung	 everyone thinks here  marisha i think if we dont do anything it means your eventual demise  travis well thats just fucking dark  sam no i think shes right  laura yeah i think youre fucked  marisha unless we beat avantika to the punch  laura if you dont fuck youre going to get fucked  sam ooh  laughter  travis now jester where would you learn a phrase like that  laura i lived  sam she lived in a brothel  laura yeah  sam do what you need to do to get all 
none	 the information out of her that you can if we see you  cozying up with her well know well know that its just an act  travis cool yeah caleb said something similar last night or a couple days ago all right  well enjoy the paintbrush  marisha oh is that it is that our meeting okay yeah  travis i mean were going to find our way to darktow  laura does it make you uncomfortable do you want someone else to seduce her  marisha yeah because i volunteer  liam shes made her interest pretty 
none	 clear  taliesin well when we want to find the ship i think i might be able to help  travis with the seducing  taliesin what no i mean no definitely not  travis i mean caduceus if you want to teach me a thing a two about wooing a woman  taliesin yeah no i really dont think i have anything to add to that i think youve been doing  just fine  travis yes to what you said and yes to what you said  taliesin i think i might be able to help you find 
none	 the ship  marisha you want me to help seduce avantika  travis you just do you girl  marisha all right  taliesin i dont understand what any of this is anymore  travis yeah i think that will be very valuable when the time comes  taliesin i thought oh about finding the ship thats all  travis about what time of the day is it  matt at this point its later afternoon  marisha oh its early  travis time to break out the banana margaritas its only afternoon  marisha its four oclock  matt 
none	 its like five or so youre like an hour or two from dusk  marisha okay  sam lets just do our jobs ive got a cannon to fix  travis sounds good  matt all right  marisha im going to make some barrels  travis caleb can i speak to you for a moment above deck  liam of course  travis ill go up  liam i will follow  matt the rest of you go about your business  laura i will follow  taliesin im going to take a nap taking a short rest  
none	 matt yasha does the same  laura im going to stand at a distance looking over the rail  matt okay  travis how far away are you  liam how far away is she were in broad daylight  laura im like you know far away  sam six seven feet  laura just looking out looking drawing im very distracted  liam just dicks dropping into the ocean  travis splashing  laughter  matt how far away are you jester  laura i think 15 feet  matt 15 feet  liam not far  travis seeing 
none	 where jester is ill pull caleb aside may i ask you a frank question  liam of course you can i scan around for avantika  matt make a perception check  liam okay that is a 22  matt looking about across the deck you do not see her currently near or visible  travis i had to admit i found myself a bit surprised my initial impression of you was  someone a bit timid and maybe reserved meek even your tone your opinion of what to do with  avantika in order to make sure that were 
none	 okay it seemed very calculated very risky do you  mind me asking if youve have you ever sacrificed anything in order to achieve a greater  goal because i feel like i am swimming in the deep end and i dont quite know what im doing  liam you are dealing with very large responsibilities right now i dont envy your  position you know my father was a soldier and he expected a lot i learned a lot from him ive  tried to live up to the man that he was and ive largely failed but ive 
none	 picked up what i could  used my wits understand my surroundings i wish i had half the courage he did i dont know you  know i think traveling with all of you has emboldened me some i was alone for a long time  and ran from everything i like this group and i enjoy traveling with you fjord  travis likewise you dont miss much do you  liam ive always been like that i have a very good memory i remember everything  travis you have a very shrewd sensibility as well you seem to be 
none	 able to weigh pros and cons  in an equation a scenario  liam and travis math brain  liam i feel like a fool much of the time im glad you think so highly of me  travis i do i dont mean any of it as a critique but more as a compliment and ill add  with it a request keep that eye of yours on avantika for me i dont entirely know what her  intentions are but i feel like there are only a few that i could ask to exercise quick judgment in  
none	 a moment of need  liam i start nervously twiddling a wire in my hand absentmindedly  travis i think you know what i mean but in case this thing gets out of hand can i count on you to  right the ship if need be  liam keep the group safe  travis of course  liam as always i will do my best  travis thank you and thank you for talking with me  liam i cough very hard into my hands and cast message to him and briefly quietly say i think  that woman 
none	 is going to try to kill you i really do  travis yeah just so ill turn and walk off  liam coughing  laura you need some water caleb  liam yeah do you have some  laura uh pause i create water in my hands  travis wait you can do that  liam i receive it theres not much left most of it spilled  laura ill keep creating it in your hands as you drink  sam you can create water  laura yeah  sam when did that happen  laura ive always been able 
dung	 to do it  travis what do you mean  laura shut up  liam is this a custom  laura yes just keep drinking keep going  liam its good  matt a few more days travel to darktow a couple of moments here in one night that you are in your  room sketching your book testing out some of your new paints you feel a hand on your shoulder you  glance over and you can see the pale soft fingers and a dark greenish sleeve resting there you  glance over to the side and you 
none	 can see the draping hood and the slight curved smile across  the angular chin of the traveler protruding from beneath the cloak  laura hi  matt hello i see you found a new toy  laura i have magical paint  matt well im quite excited at the things youre capable of jester how are things  laura theyre pretty good did you want me to make you something with the paint  matt surprise me  laura okay um traveler  matt yes my dear  laura are you having fun on our trip  matt yes 
none	 ive been pleasantly surprised  laura were pirates  matt i know your tenacity is impressive  laura we stole things but they gave something back just like you always teach you know  matt maintain that balance that seed of chaos  laura traveler how do i make a boy like me  matt well there are many different enchantments that could achieve the goals you seek  laura i dont know if i want to do it with an enchantment  matt trickery  laura maybe  matt listen listen to what piques his interest and then happen 
none	 to be the source when he needs it  if that fails there are plenty of enchantments that can sway his mind  laura i mean right youll help me out with that  matt ill do my best  laura youre not jealous are you  matt no  laura youll always be my number one love  matt i know so what are you making me  laura i want it to be a surprise for you i cant tell you  matt ill wait  laura okay im glad youre here  matt im never far  
none	 laura its a surprise  matt laughs what are you making him  laura oh gosh oh my goodness okay with my magical paint oh gosh i was planning on fucking  up some other things but right now i will make a little shrine like a little statue of the  traveler that way i can pray to him  matt as you finish painting it it takes gravity it almost seems to fall a centimeter and center  itself it goes from a twodimensional shift its almost like blinking  laura i want him shimmery green  matt 
none	 sitting up from the edge of the bed the cloaked figure walks over and lifts it and  inspects it and places it back down  laura what do you think  matt youre getting better  laura i could leave these around other places what do you think  matt preferably where it would be the least expected  laura okay  matt and the creepiest to find  laura okay  matt im excited  laura ive got to get to work  matt yes  laura i can make so many of these  matt make me 
none	 proud jester  laura i will  matt the times coming soon well meet the rest of your brethren  marisha what  laura right i wrote it down its soon right  marisha what does that mean  sam whispering the rest of your brethren  laura yeah in like less than a year  travis what  matt soon my dear  marisha is there like an advent calendar  matt as you look up from your notes closing your book you turn to look and the traveler is gone  travis thats the first we heard that 
none	 right  marisha less than a year  laura yeah i wrote down the date somewhere i know it  travis we heard that before right  matt you guys dont know anything  liam private conversation  matt fjord  travis yeah  matt maybe two days out from the reefs you go to bed that night  travis whispering oh shit  background music  matt as sleep takes you you find yourself kicking through the thick sludgelike waters that  surround you sluggish in your movements the darkness allencompassing yourself alone in these  shadowed depths a 
none	 faint green light is visible in the distance you push and swim towards it light  glowing brighter closer as that grows closer a second light even further impossibly distant but  you can acknowledge it rests on the horizon as that first light gets brighter you can see this  source taking shape its a figure female nude also swimming avantika emanating this strange  green glow swimming ahead of you her body wreathed in this faint greenishyellow aura she  looks and points to you the waters around you seem to glow the same color light you look 
none	 down  at your body and you see that you are now the third glowing source of this green energy  suddenly the waters are easy to traverse what was once sluggish and difficult to fjord is second  nature a voice comes through watching the distant light you see suddenly dives with  incredible speed nearly out of sight avantika dives down after rocketing down below you  breakneck in her speed you dart after her to give chase moving far quicker than you anticipated  you realize the water is becoming thinner and thinner like air youre falling 
dung	 three shooting  stars plummeting through a dark sky learn glancing down below this endless void you plummet  towards you make out the details from a surface rushing towards you you plummet towards an ocean  the faint distance endless glittering of moving shifting waves of some sourceless moonlight just  barely giving the shapes below with three large masses beneath you like a misshapen triangle of  land masses of incongruent sizes one two three you rocket downward towards the space between the  three the center of this triangle hitting the waters of the ocean with tremendous 
none	 force impact  but no pain you sink the light of the other two figures glittering through the lightless waters  down down you sink until you see a structure coming to view from below a tilted  tower wrapped in sea vines the hollow center providing a wide tunnel further within you peer  inside this empty tunnel of the towers depths and watch as a sudden bright yellow light shines from  within a gleaming yellow eye reward as the two other lights seem to try and drift towards  you behind you you fall into darkness and 
none	 the dream ends  travis fuck i wake up and immediately grab the map  marisha yes queen yes  liam the wettest dream  marisha fucking triangulation shit  travis yeah  taliesin blow me into bermuda  travis okay  marisha because we were over here right in the reefs ukotoa  travis well urukayxl and weve been heading towards darktow so weve been coming across did  we pass the wall coming in this direction did we pass  matt you did you passed south of it your piracy stunt hit right at this trade route there 
none	  travis okay  marisha i mean if its a triangulation  sam why would there be one there  marisha well this is where were going technically this is the shipwreck  sam thats where were going yeah  marisha right this was where we were  travis thats where we were  matt thats where you were the three masses were not even in shape and size and they were clustered  marisha theres another reef here  travis there is  marisha then theres torrid reef here  travis there is and then dead center is a 
none	 lot of space you could say that this is the center  but okay  laura are any of those places close to your shipwreck that you know of  travis well the shipwreck is here  sam what is this triangle of where the three objects are or where the three temples are  travis well in the vision the three land masses are in a triangle  marisha do you know in which direction the ship was heading  travis at the time  matt at the time from what you recall the ship was heading outward  
none	 travis yeah so itd be heading west  marisha maybe he knew where to go and he was heading there to get his gift  travis mmhmm  marisha said beau in a morning breakfast conversation or something  matt yeah anyway contemplate this  travis yeah ill be doing that later  matt in the next few days that pass eventually the fog rolls in and the blue cloudy skies you  have become familiar with on this journey give way to gray rainy and cold this marine front  rolling in as you begin to come upon the 
none	 outskirts of the dragshallow reefs  sam matt before you go on can i just real quickly steal a bunch of gunpowder while i was  learning how to be a powder monkey  travis you did have days  matt okay you do know that the current master gunner is keeping a very close eye on you after  you have exhibited  sam im talking like a pinch here  travis shawshank style  sam yeah little pinches at a time i dont want tons im not trying to steal a barrel just  enough to make one 
none	 of those bangy arrows again just enough for the tip of an arrow  matt okay make a sleight of hand check  sam thats a natural one  marisha oh my god  matt okay you steal over time a pretty decent amount of this powder youre pretty damn proud of  it yeah write down on your inventory you have a handful of pepper  laughter  taliesin black pepper  sam im going to be trying to construct a explosive arrowhead at some point  matt awesome go ahead and roll for that  liam youve successfully 
none	 secured deez nuts  sam what am i doing tinkers  matt this would be tinker tools yeah  taliesin you could make a sneeze arrow in theory  sam what is it dex  matt with this one it would be yeah dex since youve already made one  sam 15  matt 15 yeah you manage to construct a pepper arrow  marisha if someones allergic theyre fucked yeah  matt pepper bolt there you go  liam when life gives you pepper make pepper arrows  matt the ship skirts around the southern edge of the reefs 
none	 you can now see the tangled graveyard  of destroyed ships and gathered driftwood marking the shallow spots across this jagged cluster of  reef curving around a southwestern passage a channel that opens the channel beckons you entry  as you turn to head northward to what would be the center the heart of this cluster no more than  maybe 20 minutes into entering this channel avantika shouts up at the rest of the crew raise  the colors at which point the massive ogre bouldergut tosses the gnomish second mate ipess  high up to the central 
none	 mast to the crows nest where he swaps out the flag to a new one one that  is straight purple as it begins to push its way in make a perception check  marisha all of us  travis is the flag just solid purple  matt make a perception check  marisha weve seen this before  laura natural 20  matt this is a different flag than the one that was raised during piracy  marisha okay  matt natural what  laura natural 20  matt okay  taliesin 14  matt 14 so whats the 
none	 total  sam 19  matt nice  liam 14  marisha 20 not natural  travis ten for fjord and 19 for yasha  matt okay  laura natural 20 with a total of 24  matt okay jester its a couple of things you pick up on the detail of the flag it is straight  purple but there is something different about it youre not entirely certain it looks like a  straight color but theres sometimes some of the way the light hits it you can see a sheen in  parts of it thats the 
none	 best i can describe the rest of you also look around and you can see  amongst these reefs not only are there the jagged bits of it that come forward and bits of rock that  jut out the ocean amongst the rest of the rubble around and it looks like a lot of it has been  placed both as a communal barricade on top of the reef and as a challenge to anything that wishes  to come in but you can see in areas where the rock itself is a little more sturdy and above the 
none	  surface there are watchtowers and there are boltthrowers and catapults and there are  defenses all across elements of this reef that you imagine are one of the many reasons its not been  taken back by the clovis concord in what you would know to be the 40plus years that darktow has  belonged to what is known as the revelry  travis the revelry  matt the revelry is the communal band of pirates that work together to maintain some internal  order make a history check fjord and anybody else proficient with history  travis 17 
none	  matt okay  sam the revelry  liam 25  matt okay  marisha 11  matt fjord and caleb you know that this began as a dispute with the heads of the guilds in the  clovis concord they own and run a majority of the trade routes that come in and out but a lot of  the smaller shipping businesses and various other sideindustry leaders were being overtaxed  repeatedly in an attempt to close them out of the business and essentially completely own all means  of shipping in the vicinity this pissed off a 
none	 lot of people and eventually in moments of combined  desperation and frustration they banded together and where darktow was previously a very important  repair and stopping station this far out from the menagerie coast for longdistance shipping they  ransacked it and took it over they killed those that defended themselves and any of those who did  not want to raise arms would be absorbed and be allowed to become a member of what was now called  the revelry as such they have since held this location and continued to be the source of piracy  
none	 both for their own wealth and continuation of wellbeing but also as a continuous source of  aggression and destruction of the otherwise very prosperous trade that the clovis concord runs you  do know also that the revelry is run by whats called the plank king  marisha that sounds super inviting  matt the previous one was killed 15 years ago by the current plank king who challenged him the  plank king is known as wyatt marinas and all you have heard is he is a giant of a man as you move  deeper through this 
dung	 channel the day goes on begins to get somewhat dark as you begin to see  the glittering lights of the southern edge of darktow isle the cold pulls through and a light  rain begins to fall as you approach this island unlike the jungle islands that youve come across  and a vast majority of the swavain islands here off the menagerie coast is mostly rock and cliff  in fact from what you can see most of this island from this perspective is jagged cliff face  and probably a few hundred feet up is where the 
town	 islands even surface even begins at the base  around this cliff face you can see a scattered web of a shipyard just tangled docks that  maneuver around containing dozens and dozens of ships across that you see numerous torches that  mark various intersections where they all meet and built into the base of this cliff face you  see a number of buildings and windows all slowly being lit as the night grows darker and darker  this mass of naturallooking hivelike pirate city there stands before you welcome to darktow  sam darktow  marisha dope 
none	  taliesin beautiful  matt as the ship makes its way to the docks and eventually comes to a stop you can see a few  figures up there at the edge one of them that rings a bell as it comes in and a couple that  come out to meet avantika steps out and theres a couple of hands raised and go hail  avantika she goes we have returned i know it has been quite a while but success and  celebration i believe are on our lips tonight a few of the men come up and 
none	 look over the crew  and look over a few of you and take some notes and then dart off  travis guess were part of the island now  sam are we off the ships yet  matt the ship now has docked theyre beginning to take remains of the supplies the mistake is  pulled off onto the other side and orly and your other hired crew are looking very wideeyed and  confused about what the fuck is going on you literally hired a bunch of guys out of  travis they didnt sign up for that 
none	 shit  matt nicodranas that have now been brought into a  travis a monthlong journey  matt yep  marisha wow okay  matt as you begin to step off the ship  travis kill those guys  matt jamedi steps off with the rest of you  marisha oh no  matt looks to avantika and goes up to her and goes you still owe me 50 more gold i counted  what you gave me she goes oh my apologies i thought i had correctly counted that she pulls a  few coins out of her purse 
none	 and hands it to him counts it himself our business is concluded  looks to the rest of you be careful around this one be safe he turns and walks into the city  laura i liked him  sam dead man walking  taliesin complicated feelings  sam im going to get on my hands and knees and kiss the ground  matt it is salty with sea splash and cold to the touch because of the nature of the stone  sam i love it  travis i thought for sure caduceus was going to give jamedi a 
none	 little  taliesin he got away quick yeah that was not a good time  matt no one talked to him over the journey  taliesin nope  laura i thought he was on the other ship i guess we were switching back and forth between ships  matt there was a lot of back and forth over the journey avantika turns to the rest crew it has  been a good journey you have all been very kind you have been resolute and ukotoa will be proud  laura and marisha whispering ukotoa  matt tonight we drink come 
none	 let us be off to the bloated cup the rounds are on me  sam and marisha the bloated cup  liam whispering ukotoa  matt marius comes around the edge of the  travis oh god  sam nervous voice hi marius  marisha oh my god marius  matt of the docks yes remember marius  liam yes  marisha yeah  matt yes hes like okay dont mean to make this really where the fuck are we  travis were at the end of the world my friend  matt okay  laura youre a pirate tada 
none	  matt nervous sighing  travis its going to be time for you to toughen up a bit do you have a pirate face  laura its really good thats good  travis is that a pooping face or  matt both really  travis okay well until you find a better one thatll do whats your pirate name  matt what should it be  marisha marius the mariner lepual  matt got it  marisha le  matt oh theres more  marisha lepain  matt lepual lepain  marisha lepual lepuain i dont know thats all i 
none	 got  taliesin that was really good do me  marisha oh caduceus the juices  taliesin i like juice  matt orlys big turtle hand clasps on the back of your left shoulder beau and goes oh i kind of  like that one  marisha how do you mean  matt well i like juice  marisha okay yay yeah  laura orly the swirly  sam yeah thats good  matt unsure uncomfortable humming  laura teach me how to do tattoos that are fancy  matt wait what  laura make me your apprentice make me 
none	 your bequeath me  matt im going to need a drink  marisha i guess well follow  matt the rest of the crew looking confused amongst themselves stick together and they come  over one of them his name wouldve been oh actually no at this point this is gallan  gallan who has recovered and is  laura fellow carpenter  matt yes who has become loosely the because hes the only one who was originally on the mist  and knows it well hes become the den mother of the other hired crew youve brought into this 
none	  wiley adventure he comes up and goes so all these ones  travis yeah  matt whats the plan  travis did we say there was a plan  marisha mm do we live with plans  travis im not sure did we have a plan  marisha we had a vague idea  sam we hired them for a certain amount of time  laura yeah we should probably let them go home eventually  travis i dont even really remember who they are  taliesin i mean to be fair we should let us go home eventually 
none	  laura yeah maybe they should stay on the boat  sam after its repaired  laura yeah then we will take them home eventually  marisha dont we need to pay them more  travis no i think weve brought them to a port of great business if they choose to stay here  they certainly can otherwise theyll have to wait until were leaving again  matt ill ask around he doesnt seem bothered by it hes been here before gallan left this  port on the mist but he seems genuinely over the travel hes gotten a 
none	 little bit concerned and  seems somewhat invested in the new crew youve hired he goes and relays that message to  the rest of them  travis im just scared  marisha whoops  matt in the meantime the rest of the crew seems to have followed suit with avantika leaving a few  crewmen that are just a part of the docks to keep watch  travis how guarded or patrolled or monitored are the docks  matt pretty damn well patrolled and monitored this is the bread and butter of their business  travis in this area 
none	 are there uniformed patrols or do you just see well armed  liam muscle is obviously everywhere  matt you get the sense here and based on your history checks everyone who resides in darktow is  a member of the revelry  travis is packing  matt by the way you guys are members of the revelry  marisha so by touching down on the island you become a member  matt well by becoming part of avantikas crew coming into port and having a few individuals  mark your presence you imagine thats probably the case  marisha 
none	 were a part of the revelry  matt well what are you guys doing  travis were going to follow  liam were going to be following the people who have been here before  taliesin lets make sure the crew knows that they should be repairing the ship and we need to be  shipshape at some point  laura yeah  marisha i dont know if that was the easiest membership ive ever obtained or the most  difficult membership ive ever obtained its kind of hard to say  liam following up on fjords question or travis 
none	 question the muscle that we see around us does  it look like its are we in deadwood or is there a strong police force of sorts that is  making sure that shit is not going down constantly  travis something they would wear that would identify  liam yeah is there anyone in charge or is it just a saloon with cowboys everywhere  matt its more the former than the latter from the first part there is no uniformed guard  there is no  travis theyre not wearing a hat or a sash  taliesin this 
none	 is golden age of piracy barbados basically were in the thick of it  matt yeah the heavy realm of piracy has only existed for 40plus years on this coast  taliesin oh wow okay  matt its still in some ways finding its footing  travis oh lord we all going to die well tell the crew they can have the evening they can have  the evening weve just been at sea this whole time but in the morning we expect work to  continue on the mistake  liam probably the only rule here is talk shit 
dung	 get hit  matt winding through the docks following the rest of avantikas crew the docks and bridges  its this labyrinth to find your way beyond that to the stone and rock where you had kissed  earlier the city itself is a series of switchback paths and carved caverns and cave entrances that  have since been outfitted with pieces of wood with windows now at this point its pretty much  pitch black in the sky what little bit of light there is from the nearby torch and lantern light  gives just a hint of the 
town	 mist thats rolled in across the outskirts of the island the only light  sources you have are those you keep on you or the distant glowing smattering of hundreds of firelit  windows lit from the inside the warm buildings that make up the city as you make your way to  what you assume to be the tavern the bloated cup if you will avantikas currently standing outside  talking to somebody there you see this burly roughlooking human man probably a week and a  half unshaven this thick five oclock shadow grayish curled hair that goes 
none	 right about  shoulderlength its slicked back probably with his fingers to one side but its oily enough  where it stays in place looks like hes wearing an officious coat and theyre currently in the  middle of a discussion and she looks over her shoulder to the rest of you and goes ah my  apologies there is one bit of business we must attend to before we can celebrate the rest of you  continue on my new compatriots it seems and the human figure pipes up and goes word has  reached the ears of the 
none	 plank king that youve brought new blood here to darktow i imagine these  are the new blood based on and he looks at a sheet of paper thats handed to him and looks at  the description that was written and he would appreciate you bringing them to the throne roost  and have an audience  sam who who are you  matt well im the assistant of the plank king  sam what is your name  matt james tybalt  sam james tybalt assistant to the plank king do we need to bring any presents or 
none	 anything to the  plank king when we meet him  matt im certain he wouldnt argue he smiles now this is the first time youve seen his grin  and theres maybe six or seven teeth most of them are blackening id recommend yall follow me  sam yes sir  matt you too avantika he wants to check in she sighs but gives a smile ipess bring like  500 he starts counting out gold from one of the chests they had brought with them  travis we never divvied up that box  matt no  laura 
none	 no we didnt  sam thats for her to do  marisha thats for him to do  travis no for me to do  laura its the quartermaster  marisha its for the quartermaster he said divvy up treasure  matt thats what quartermasters do  sam balls  travis yeah it was intentional guys were fine  matt its all good the coin is passed over to a smaller chest and avantika carries it up under her  arm you guys are led to the western side of this city and then begin climbing up this precarious  
none	 set of winding stairs carved out of the rocky cliff  laura whoa  matt above the city slick with mist and recent rain it looks like the way the winds hitting  the rain isnt hitting the cliff side but you can see it passing maybe 15 20 feet in front of you  laura this is precarious you guys  matt partway up this climb the occasional torch is now replaced with a wooden pike holding a skull  or a head at varying stages of decay  sam i hear rain  laura im going to put 
none	 my metal scary mask on  matt okay you put your metal scary mask on  travis you feeling at home there deucy  taliesin this is nice  matt youre led up further maybe 250 300 feet up this cliff face leading you with some of the  bursts of wind to lean against it to pull across the stone stairs themselves vary from two feet  wide to maybe a foot at times looking down over the edge you can imagine a few folks have found  their end with an odd misstep the stairs finally stop at 
town	 a wide stone shelf that overlooks the town  at about 200 to 300 feet above the furthermost edge ending just above the rocky waters of the  inlet a cave mouth greets you against the cliff warm with firelight two watchmen notice you and  they stand there keeping an eye as a cloaked man pushes past you to descend from where you came he  just pushes past you avantika nods to the guards and shows the chest  travis the guy that pushes past whats he look like whats he wearing  matt hes a little ways 
dung	 past you now make a perception check  travis you cant just let these guys go by  sam it was just a dude  travis nine  marisha and laura nein  matt its too dark and theres too much rain its hard to make out any details unfortunately  avantika continues in after showing the chest the offering the rest of you follow  laura that is our offering too its all our offering  matt as you follow inside the smell of fine cooked meats and sauces mingles with wet leather  and stagnant water a soft 
none	 fiddle and squeezebox duet dances through the evening air the bardic  sources atop stools next to a large stone chair carved from the surrounding rock sitting atop the  throne is a giant of a man half giant to be precise his dull gray skin marked with scars  his coat long and velvet blue tattered at the edges plain breeches and boots shift as he  stands his eyes cold shifting with his smile long black curls toppling along the sides of his  head past his shoulders framing his face to about mid chest now you know 
none	 this through your  research and some of you had experiences for the most part male goliaths dont have hair let alone  such luxurious locks  marisha european british giant shit  matt as he stands up a servant enters and leaves a bowl of somewhat bruised feet somewhat bruised  fruit at the feet of the throne the large figure claps his hands once loudly and the music stops  coming to a halt deep guests avantika you bring guests welcome friends to the revelry  come sit a spell two servants all of a sudden come behind 
none	 you hear the scraping of wood against  stone as two long benches are pressed behind you you find yourself awkwardly having to sit on them  as they creak with your weight another bowl of nuts and somewhat mushy berries is placed in  caduceus hands a bottle of wine is opened and handed to caleb my manners where are they  chuckles i am wyatt marinas the plank king of darktow master of the revelry  laura all hail the king  taliesin and sam all hail the king  marisha hear hear  matt and you are 
none	  sam oh yes we are part of avantikas crew but humble servants in her adventurous adventures i  am some call me gilligan others other names i present to you this dried meat of the harpy as a  present for you harpy jerky  matt sets it awkwardly on one of the arms of the stone throne okay gilligan so avantika it  seems you took all of these under your wing she nods and takes her chest and puts it forward and  goes that is true and i believe the rest will introduce themselves here in 
none	 another moment  laura im the little sapphire i lift up my im the little sapphire  matt grunt of acknowledgement  liam oh my name is philip  marisha im beau some call me tracy  travis im fjord tusktooth quartermaster of the squalleater  taliesin they call me clay  matt yasha just goes im yasha well youve all come under the banner of the squalleater what  draws you to a life of piracy what drives you  sam so much  travis what drives any of us necessity urgency for a better life  matt all

none	 he  gets the best  matt okay well if the captain here vouches for you then i trust you wont go causing any  trouble only law here is no trouble coming between pirates while within the reef you cause  trouble on land i judge you youve seen a few judged on your way up here  marisha oh yeah  taliesin we did oh yeah  matt trouble outside the reef well youll either return to explain your cases and i decide  whats fair or in need of punishment or if you dont return i just 
none	 assume youre guilty thems  the big ones you understand  laura does this just include harming other pirates or stealing from them too  matt depends on what the other one thinks if the other one doesnt want to be harmed or stolen  from well thats breaking the law  laura got it  travis what if the other one isnt around to lodge a complaint  matt well hard for me to hear that you broke it now darktow means protection means family  and family shares its good fortune he looks to avantika and she now 
none	 kicks the chest across and  scrapes he stops it with his foot and kicks open the lid and the coins are there now visible a  couple spilling out i accept your tribute welcome back well get your ships up and fixed  real soon welcome to the revelry laughs  uneasy laughter  matt you all sorry lot youve certainly shacked up with one of the craziest lasses of the swavain  islands thats for sure  laura shes crazy all right  matt a damn dreamchaser she be so be warned where she leads you shes crazy

none	 that room outside from avantika  matt make a perception check  travis 17  matt 17 couple of things you notice one you glance in the vicinity you look and notice the  plank king right where the hairline is its a duller paler white in that moment you remember  the first plank king was definitely known for his longer darker locks  groaning  taliesin thats metal  travis it puts the lotion in the basket  taliesin thats some metal shit  matt looking around the interior of the chamber because the way this is carved 
none	 inside the  mountain its this nice arched cavern top and there are number of alcoves and hidden spaces and  you glance around it and first at just a quick glance notice at least six or seven other figures  that are hidden in the alcoves just watching  travis creatures  matt figures seem to be either human or  marisha roof snipers  travis whispers statues  matt as youre all being ushered out of the chamber and pushed to the side the plank king is  like anyway off with you enjoy your night drink well 
none	 well take care of that and theres  a little tug on your arm beau the plank king comes and whispers in the side of your ear he  says youve a keen ear right avantika ever does anything untoward to our little community  here you let me know theres some grand coin in it for you  marisha how much  matt just backs away  marisha i yank away from him move on  matt okay  sam shes a snitch  taliesin can tell youre a snitch can tell at 50 feet of course youre a

tavern	 seat of rule  matt well over a decade probably  marisha how much on average do you pay him to not kill you  matt oh well its not paying him to not kill us its sharing in our spoils to better the community  marisha and if you didnt share your spoils  matt i dont know ive never tried  marisha right  laura he has beautiful hair  sam its awesome yeah  taliesin very its lush  travis yeah its something  matt nevertheless im going to get drunk whos with me  sam hear
