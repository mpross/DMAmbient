none	 matt hello and good evening everyone welcome to tonights episode of critical role where a bunch  of us voiceactors get together and play dungeons and dragons crazy fun nerdy times  so we are unfortunately missing travis willingham again this evening because hes a pussy and had  to go see avengers tonight so feel free to let him know on twitter but anyway we have a really  fun actionpacked adventure as if last weeks wasnt tension enough lets see how the rest of  the group manages to recover from their climactic battle at the top of 
town	 emberhold  but in the meantime lets go ahead and give you an intro and some of the character backgrounds  before we come back  dramatic music  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that 
none	 changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by 
none	  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent  gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were best of friends  a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring 
none	 her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time  pike is ready  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an 
none	 appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt 
none	 only pity for this well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or 
none	 accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  
none	 born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized 
none	 her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if 
none	 she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the 
dung	 sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did 
none	 not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  
none	 songs almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his  skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years 
town	 on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on  the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood unless its to protect fellow  gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i 
town	 am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild 
none	 member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be 
town	 fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and 
none	 find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to 
town	  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided 
none	 to return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack 
none	 for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the  difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other  it was at the 
none	 age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief while vex kept  to the woods she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt 
none	 and to track to spy and to shoot and through a  series of fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen  trinket to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt hey guys welcome back while we are missing travis its totally fine avengers is a fantastic  film its a wonderful film and hope he doesnt spoil anything for us in his return but he is  missed travis we miss you well have you back next week hopefully  
none	 orion im going to spoil the movie for everybody they win  taliesin and laura but do they  matt i dont know its joss whedon laughs  orion i didnt say who they were  matt oh thats true all right so welcome everyone for those of you whos this the first  time laughs buckle up for some interesting so were a bunch of voice actors who play dungeons   dragons and this is our campaign weve been running for a while to give you a little headsup  on the story so far the party was 
none	 hired to find an individual named lady kima and she is a  halfling paladin the platinum dragon bahamut is her deity  sam and we found her  matt you did i was going to get to that  all laugh  matt so they went seeking her in caverns beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer after much  fighting and surviving they manage to find their way to a duergar fortress called emberhold where  they found lady kima captive beneath  they released her and then using her help assaulted the throne room at the top and 
none	 managed  to slay king murghol of the duergar however in the process grog our intrepid barbarian was  kidnapped by the queen mage before she could be slain who then also disintegrated a portion of  the roof letting an entire cavalcade of molten rock into the fortress  the party then had to make a heated escape however a number of the party members due to the  gaze of the two basilisks that were kept in the throne room as pets lady kima and our tiberius  stormwind our dragonborn sorcerer are currently stone dragging them out 
none	 of the fortress as the  magma began to fill the interior a very deft escape was made aside from vax unfortunately  getting his foot temporarily submerged in the lava taking some serious damage to his foot  the party manage to make their way outside of the emberhold proper and youve all taken a moment to  breathe at this point realizing that thankfully for the most part youve all survived aside from  the missing party member and a few in a state of flux at the moment  so picking up there where we left off 
none	 youre all breathing heavily the sincerity of the battle has  just come over you the adrenalines still pumping through your system  laura your foot is melted off  liam its kind of there groans  matt mostly theres some you can see four of the five toes  laura oh thats not bad its four out of five  matt about three and a half  liam did i lose the big or the small  matt laughs this would be the small  ashley oh you can do without the pinkie  marisha your balance is probably 
none	 a little wonky  matt yeah a little bit  liam clears that athletes foot though gone  matt sure enough  sam is anyone following us can we do a quick check around and just see  matt make a perception check  sam perception check starting it off with a 19  matt glancing around you start hearing various duergar screams from above as the individuals that  were still inside the fortress are in the process of trying to get out or in the process of slowly  melting in the molten rock what you do also 
town	 notice is that off towards the bottom base of the  stronghold a number of duergar that reside in the buildings that surround the exterior of emberhold  proper are mounting arms and charging up towards the stronghold to give aid to wherever this  seeming loud shouting and screaming is coming from  laura can they see us  marisha does anyone seem to be paying attention to us  matt no theyre far enough away where you dont think its an issue and youre off to the side  for the moment but you do see probably close 
none	 to 30 to 40 duergar are currently swarming out the  small city making their way towards emberhold  marisha so right now theyre focused on the chaos of the temple  matt from what you can see  sam we should get out of here  laura there was a path further down that led further on into the tunnels i think we should  follow that  marisha well hang on grog cant be far right  sam he could be in another dimension  marisha no he can only be a thousand feet away  sam says 
none	 who  marisha they used the spell dimension door that tiberius has  laura so we hope he used dimension door  sam i have a spell that can go to another dimension chuckles  marisha well i remember the gods on high telling us last week that  we recognized the spell that was used  sam by the way this is the best conversation weve ever had with tiberius  all laugh  laura oh tiberius  marisha aw man i feel that comes back to bite us in the ass later nervous laugh because he is  
none	 still conscious right  matt no  laura he has no idea whats happening  matt hes in darkness he cant hear hes not conscious  sam if grog is close we still need to get out of the way of these 30 people so lets go hide  laura we still need to hide and heal  taliesin lets at least follow the path find a place where we can hide and recuperate  laura around the corner or something can we stealth further down  matt you can try to you currently are carrying two large solid stone 
none	 statues with you so its  definitely possible but youre going to have to come up with a creative way of doing so  taliesin grog had the rug didnt he  matt grog had the entire bag of holding  taliesin shit  marisha im going to go ahead and cast pass without a trace on the party  matt okay  liam percy i think you and i are on tiberius duty  taliesin yes sighs okay  sam if we do not move will this 30 duergar mass hit us at some point  matt you can 
none	 find out  sam oh jesus laughs  orion its like asking the future  laura can i use my robe of infinite twine which i have on my person in another game before  because its connected to my rope can i use that and tie it around kima and hook it to trinket so  he can drag kima along  matt you can  laura okay  taliesin very clever  matt so i will say for this circumstance as you guys are preparing this casting the spell  beginning dragging the stone the group make an 
none	 initiative check  sam we took too much time  laura we should just run  taliesin natural 20  matt yeah you have some flashing there we go  marisha thats been a kind die to you  matt so 20 plus whatever your initiative modifier is  taliesin 27  matt 27  marisha 13  orion who cares  sam ten  ashley 12  laura 17  liam 15  matt all right  sam distract them get them away from us  matt you guys begin to drag the stone or chuckles your two stone 
dung	 companions across the  jagged obsidian floor in this deep dark cavern the heat from the nearby lava fall is still  causing you to sweat profusely and youre sore from the previous battle you just endured those  of you who are wounded you can feel the stretch of the muscles and tearing of what sinew has taken  damage in the process  as you begin to pull parallel to this duct of lava that pours off the side of emberhold you  keep low so that you arent actually blocking the light source which would be a 
none	 very keen visual to  anything thats looking in that direction from a distance but you slowly make your way across at  this point the duergar have not been able to get there before you guys move off from the side so  they havent caught up to the position you were previously but theyre beginning to swarm around  the sides and you see them yelling at each other and shouting commands some of them are starting  to grab large rocks and fill in areas of the stronghold some of them you can see are robed  
none	 individuals begin casting spells you can see portions of other stone walls beginning to mount  up and try and block the flow from the interior and exterior of emberhold  however you guys are still within eyesight technically of any duergar on that side of the  fortress so im going to ask everyone now to make a stealth check those that are pulling the  statues with disadvantage  laura so thats trinket  orion plus ten  laura but we all add plus ten  matt correct to the final roll  laura okay  liam i 
none	 have a question if i have advantage for other reasons i have a cloak of elvenkind which  gives me advantage does the advantage and disadvantage cancel out into one  matt they do your foot being wounded though is a disadvantage right now  liam right  matt so that then goes back down to disadvantage  sam cant win with this guy  matt just for this circumstance unfortunately youre dragging a statue with a partially melted  foot right now  taliesin liam it doesnt matter  marisha you still have plus ten to the roll because 
none	 pass without a trace  matt so  sam 14  matt plus the ten  sam thats including the ten  matt all right  marisha 22  taliesin 11  ashley 20 thats my low roll  laura thats 20 for trinket and 29 for me  liam 25  matt all right so you keep hunched low slowly stone grinding noise dragging these stone  obelisks of individuals across the jagged floor you seemingly do so without any of the duergars  eyes catching you through the low light of the cavern partially due to the fact 
none	 that you guys  are doing a pretty decent job and partially the fact theyre more obsessed that the central piece  of their fortress right now is essentially about to be completely filled with molten rock  about 20 25 minutes or so you manage to pull just past where the lava flow dips down into what  looks like a small opening in the flooring and you are past the immediate heat of the magma  river you are now pressed up against the wall of the cavern as it begins to twist around and head  downward 
none	 further deeper into this subterranean mountainous space youre all beaten youre all  sore and currently what do you want to do  taliesin keyleth can you cover the entrance to where we are to give us a  little bit more of a stealthy  marisha no  laura no more spells  marisha i am exhausted i cant do anything else right now  liam and whats the terrain is it just flat out out in the open to see or is it scoured with ins  and outs peaks and valleys  matt its the same type 
none	 of topography youve encountered when you first entered this giant  cavern so you can see large crooked black spires of obsidian rock shooting up and curving towards  the ceiling its all over the place  marisha i can make another hallucinatory terrain i can do that still  laura okay maybe you can make it  marisha can i make it to where it just looks like a wall  matt how long does it last  marisha i think hallucinatory terrain lasts an hour if i think about it books books wheres  my book  laura 
none	 can i look around and and see if theres anywhere that looks like we could hide tuck in  between rocks or something where we wouldnt be visible  taliesin please  matt go ahead and make a perception  laura oh wait i get an advantage  matt because you are in the underdark correct  laura 20  marisha it lasts for 24 hours  sam 24 hours  taliesin put a lava flow in front of us  sam but you have to be concentrating the whole time and you cant you cant go to sleep  
none	 laura 20  matt as shes glancing at that you make your way about ten minutes away from the area where the  rest of the group is currently gathered keeping a very very close eye on the topography of the wall  of the cavern as it slowly curves around and further in that direction you do manage to find  portions of the wall that jut out and leave these small pockets they themselves might not be super  safe for a long period of time but they give you a little bit of  laura cover  
none	 matt little bit of cover depending on how well you were to dress you might be able to see few  individuals discovering you if you were to stay there  laura okay lets do that  marisha its not a concentration spell it just takes a minute to cast and it lasts for 24 hours  so im going to go ahead and cast it and make it look like theres just a wall with another lava  flow thats come out and is starting to happen  matt okay so as you walk back to notify the party 
none	 you watch as a portion of the mountain  seemingly out of nowhere extends and a lava flow appears pouring out of the wall  marisha wait was someone not inside  sam no were all in  matt she was out and about while you did this  laura i was searching for another place to hide  liam its fine its an illusion vax pokes his head through the illusionary lava and goes  were in here  laura oh lovely  matt so your heart rate eventually normalizes you do have a decent pocket of space here 
none	 that as  long as nothing attempts to walk into the wall you should be okay to rest here  taliesin so we have some time lets regroup  laura i think we should probably  taliesin sleep in shifts  marisha wait heres what im afraid of if we sleep we could lose grogs trail he could be  nearby right now  taliesin were not much use to anyone right now  sam lets just make a decision right now to leave grog and continue on  ashley no  sam lets just forget about him he was 
none	 a good friend  laura what  sam well have a toast to him  laura and ashley scanlan  sam well sing about songs of his memory  marisha you are shitting with us right  sam within a few days well forget he ever existed  taliesin scanlan no one else wants to go to a whorehouse with you youll be going to  whorehouses alone  sam all right fine  taliesin thank you  liam heres another option my foot hurts but im not too bad how are you  laura sighs im okay  liam 
none	 we could go look  laura or maybe i can use my tracking and see if i can catch a scent grog does smell  marisha i can use my beast sense that is one more thing i can still do i could theoretically  we could use trinket  liam we need to undo the stone that has taken over tiberius and kima  taliesin do i have the necessary tools to synthesize a potion out of the basilisk blood  matt you can certainly try its a very ramshackle setup you do not have an alchemical  set 
none	 but you can certainly attempt to using a small fire a couple of your general smelting  tools you use for your metal work you could attempt to distill it down but that would be a  combination of a tinkering roll on your point followed up by somebody elses medicine roll to  attempt to properly prepare it  laura are all of tiberiuss things stone with him  matt yes  ashley im going to walk over to tiberius and cast greater restoration on him  matt okay so as youre having this discussion tiberius you briefly go 
none	 from this moment in the  heat of combat where you feel your muscles intensify and tensing up and not answering to your  minds command as you look up angrily at a series of duergar that have just been blown up by a  fireball to cold taking yourself and as the cold fades you are now in the center of a gargantuan  cavern surrounded by all of your friends you guys watch as tiberiuss form  fades in through the stone  marisha and ashley tiberius  laura good job pike  sam i was so worried 
none	 about you  taliesin or we could cast a spell that also works well  orion dwarven accent what the hell is going on  ashley i didnt know if that was going to work  marisha but that the only time you can do that right  laura wait she cant do that again you cant do it again for kima  ashley i have another 5th level now so i could do it again  laura and once we rest youll have it again  orion dwarven accent whoa what happened to all the other little dwarves  
none	 sam you dont have to do the accent anymore  laura you probably should keep your voice down tiberius  orion well this is just how i sound  ashley no we already got through were on the other side  you dont have to act like a god anymore  laura grog is missing actually  orion dwarven accent oh great  laura and the queen took him  sam are you stuck like this  orion no i could change back anytime i want but i really like how i look  all laugh  ashley are we 
none	 going to rest  sam wait but what about kima  marisha we have to find grog  laura we have to find grog but we have no spells if we do find him we cant do anything  sam can you unstone kima now or  ashley i can but then i wouldnt have another 5th level  orion dwarven accent clarota what do you think we should do  matt clarota who is currently like staring at the statue of kima you can see theres a brief  bead of thought behind clarotas eyes and the voice sinks 
none	 into the rest of your minds  simultaneously we may be able to leave her here for safekeeping  orion i knew you were going to say that a different option oh and thank you pike  ashley youre welcome tiberius  all laugh  matt if you insist on bringing her then we should do it soon we should not be leaving  anything behind trace of our passage  liam where did your kin take our big friend  matt clarota thinks for a second and says it was not my kin that took him but the duergar 
none	 if  anything i imagine he might be residing within that infernal city though if theyve taken him  elsewhere i do not know the way of the ashskins  orion but kima does  laura we should wake her up  orion pike you can do it one more time and take a little rest right  ashley i am going to walk on over to kima touch her cast greater restoration again  matt okay  laura where do you touch her laughs  ashley i touch her arm  matt okay  taliesin dont cheapen this  
none	 matt classy as you reach out the divine energy emanates from pikes hand that begins to cascade  across kimas form kima who is in mid battle with her greatsword in the air as soon as her  flesh returns to her she finishes her swing  ashley i put my shield up  matt however it does ping into the side of your shield and you deflect the blow and you see  kima for a second is like panting slowing to normal breathing  liam easy easy  ashley calm down  matt she throws the blade down 
none	 on the ground and goes i am so sorry  ashley its okay you were midswing i get it we are fine it was just a shield were fine  matt she reaches around and she pulls her symbol of bahamut out from her around her neck and just  clutches it for a second and says what happened  laura you were turned to stone the king got killed the queen took grog we dont know where  sam and clarota was really helpful to us  laura actually clarota got you out of that castle alive  matt 
town	 she turns around and glares at clarota briefly with a look of confusion and mistrust and  clarota just goes  all laugh  liam you honestly would not be here if it werent for the illithid its true  matt she glances back at you and gives under her breath and theres a good chance none of us may  be here if it gets its way down the road louder nevertheless i thank you it is good to know at  least we took one of their top champions down the fact that the queen still exists is 
none	 worrisome as  at least from what i seemed to gather she had the true reign over most of the duergar down here  orion do you know where she would be at  matt where did she escape how did she take him  liam she disappeared with our goliath friend  laura gasps oh my gosh wait did i hunters mark the queen  liam yes you did  laura did i  taliesin you did  laura i can use my hunters mark to track her  sam you can  all cheer  sam how long 
none	 does it last and how does it work  liam but that was just 30 minutes ago  sam i know but we all have to rest  laura it maintains for up to eight hours  sam eight hours but we have to rest  ashley because we need to heal i am pretty low  sam im at two  ashley youre at two  marisha okay theory proposition proposal what if we use your hunters mark figure out where she  is get there camp out nearby tackle it in the morning  laura can i use 
none	 my hunters mark to find out where she is and then we rest and go there  matt you can attempt that  ashley what if we took a short rest  laura wait wait wait lets just find out where she is first  ashley what if we just took a sevenhour nap  all laugh  ashley because thats all really anyone sleeps anyway  taliesin i think six hours is about what it takes  matt six to eight hours is the general long rest period that i would allow for that  laura and ashley okay 
none	  liam i think we should all rest for a moment i think vexahlia and i should go out for an hour or  two just to see which direction i mean they are not going to back to emon  laura ive got hunters mark just stay put footless  all laugh  orion wait a minute what happened to your toe  sam youre not stealth anymore you got a busted foot youre at disadvantage on everything  liam i was pretty awesome 30 minutes ago now im just slightly less awesome  sam can we at least 
none	 heal you up before you go  laura yes just give us one second can i use the freaking hunters mark  sam how does it work  laura i dont know  matt so you take a moment you step beyond the boundary of the illusion momentarily close your  eyes and concentrate on that small blip of nature based divine energy that you lent and grappled  onto queen ulara with you take a moment and concentrate and you recall her face you recall  strangely her scent in a weird way the bestial nature of your connection 
none	 with trinket and nature  scent is a very strong means of tracking and the scent of a duergar is a very terrible mix between  salty brine and earth  liam like axe for men  matt essentially yeah yeah its ye olde axe you concentrate on this and you recall the  stronghold you begin to see a trace where all of a sudden her path in the stronghold is fading and is  cold a new path has opened up in the center of the duergar city at the base of the stronghold it  seems to 
none	 have moved slightly in that direction but you cant pinpoint where and is currently at  rest somewhere in that vicinity  sam she is still close  laura whispers the city theyre close louder so that is right in front of the keep  marisha wait are they in an underground base  laura they are in the city  matt essentially where the cavern kind of rises up and meets the wall emberhold is at the top of  that rising of the ground and emberhold lies there where all the lava pours down and trickles  down 
town	 you guys are off to the side this whole portion of the floor that crawls up to emberhold  is covered in duergar buildings it is a small city that surrounds it she resides somewhere in  the center of that  marisha so were on the same level as them or are they above us  matt they are a little bit above you guys are at a lower point as the actual ground you follow  curves around and descends  sam but once we walk out of here we will be at the same level  marisha 
none	 i have a theory ive a new skill that ive recently learned and was practicing a lot  when i was with the earth ashari while we were gone for the past six months they taught me the  ways of the earth elementals  orion oh thats fun  marisha so and as an earth but i am still new at it  ashley thats okay we all start somewhere  marisha thank you pike  ashley youre welcome  marisha thank you i mean i am a little selfconscious about it still but i can travel  through 
none	 the earth  laura and pop up perhaps where she is  orion dwarven accent ooh like a little gopher  laura all of us or just you  marisha it is not a burrowing thing right  matt you glide through the earth  liam more like a shadowcat kind of thing  matt essentially  laura is it all of us or just you  marisha just me but i could get inside  laura well but then you will be alone surrounded by duergar and grog  marisha well i am not talking about right now  
none	 ashley could we put invisibility on her  marisha if we do some sort of flanking thing  liam well that does sound useful  taliesin it is it is going to be useful  marisha i am wondering if we can make a tunnel though i can theoretically okay theoretically  we could rest and i could keep all of my spells and use all of my magical focus to tunnel us out  depending on how far we are going we can do an underground approach  liam but concretely right now we need nappies  marisha yeah 
none	  taliesin lets sleep  marisha but what if they leave while we sleep  liam but we are essentially powerless  taliesin and what are we going to do if we find them  laura im going to only sleep for a little bit cause i didnt use all my spells i only need to  rest for half the amount of time maybe  matt it doesnt work that way  all laugh  matt a solid six hours youd probably be able to since you guys are in a hidden area youll feel  more comfortable depending 
none	 on how you set your bedding here you could  probably do it in six hours  laura i think well be fine because she needs to rest as well we hurt her pretty badly  liam i think it is safe to assume shes brought grog back to her seat of power why would she go  anywhere else shes at her strongest where she is  taliesin i think theyre staying  sam were going to rest  liam sleep  marisha okay all right  laura weve got to sleep keyleth  ashley i know youre right

none	 move forward she glances briefly over at clarota  whos now further back towards the wall just sitting in this meditative state  so let us rest  taliesin brilliant idea  liam one last thing before we lay our heads down for the night pike do you have any salve or  anything you could help me put on my foot or could your god help with my little toe  marisha i could help you with some natural mediciney stuff maybe  liam it stings a bit  matt you have not encountered a person with any sort 
none	 of physical marring to this degree  necessarily and those that usually did it was a permanent thing so this is something that you  would have to experiment with  ashley could i try healing a very concentrated energy just on his foot a healing spell  matt you could certainly try  laura you can do it pike  marisha is there anyway i could assist her  matt possibly all right  ashley lets try it  marisha possibly  liam i mean a clockwork foot from percy does sound cool  ashley if were going to 
none	 rest it doesnt hurt to try  marisha that way we can sleep on it  ashley you can sleep on it  liam literally  laura maybe this yellow vial of potion could do something for it as well  liam thats bengay  ashley ill try cure wounds at ill try 4th level since were going to sleep  matt all right so go ahead and roll the corresponding dice for that  ashley so i roll  matt 4d8  5 is what it would be  laura why do you keep putting your foot up near 
none	 me  all laugh  laura can i keep an ear out for anything approaching  matt very much so  ashley wait plus my spell caster  matt plus your modifier which is five  marisha i start building a positive chi like a healing chi ball  sam is she doing a standard healing here is my song of rest going to help at all  matt your song of rest would actually be of aid to this  sam okay so im going to sing while you heal if thats all right  ashley please do  
none	 matt all the healers convene scanlan begins  marisha i light some sage  sam okay ready singing wherever you go whatever damage theyve done we will be right  here waiting to heal you no matter what hit points you take or how your foot breaks we will  be right here  sam and ashley waiting for you  liam all that improv school paid off  all laugh  matt as you take the healing energy youve gathered from your own naturebased casting you  infuse the healing spell you do how many points of healing from 
none	 the spell  ashley 27  matt 27 go ahead and make a medicine check  marisha is this what i can maybe assist her with  laura it looks really disgusting by the way its so gross  ashley what do i roll do i roll the 20  matt roll a d20 and add your proficiency modifier  liam can i apply my luck feat to her  laura you dont have any feet left  all laugh  sam feet pun  ashley 21  matt 21 as you finish the spell you can see where the 
none	 mostlygone second small toe has grown  to mostly a full toe and theres a small stub where the little one is  laura youve got a toe nubbin  ashley hey man we got a little stub a little bit  matt youre promoting a level of divine regeneration at a very very slow pace youve  never attempted this before and there is some progress but this may be an over time thing you  have to do  ashley over time i just keep doing it  matt once a day you might want to attempt this 
none	 and eventually he probably will recover but not  immediately  sam until then hes a gimp  liam i think i see pikes deity in my toenail  all laugh  ashley its gonna take time that was just a little manicure that we did real quick  marisha we could just own it and call you  taliesin little piggy  marisha well i was going to say vax the ninetoe  liam and put a knife on it  taliesin could put a very tiny knife on it  laura a teeny tiny little knife  taliesin 
none	 could actually give you a nail clipper you could clip your own nails  marisha we can get you a prosthetic little toe that has a little compartment for poison  liam i would take a brass claw  marisha or a brass claw toe thats fun maybe we could get you a raptor claw thats cool  taliesin lets sleep  sam before we go to sleep i go over to kima and i say to her lady kima i think were all going  to take a rest and you as well correct  matt i think i 
none	 should  sam we can trust you while were all asleep not to do anything to any of our companions correct  matt if youre worried about the mind flayer ill be keeping an eye but nothing beyond that  remember he has to make the sidestep the wrong step before i take any action trust and know  that if i were to strike a blow its at his own poor choice and actions  orion that first part of what you said rhymed  sam does she seem to be telling the truth  matt make an insight 
none	 check  sam a what what check  matt insight  sam insight okay 18  matt she seems to be true  sam okay  matt she is legitimately concerned about clarota but also understands that at this moment it has  not done anything to necessarily draw her blade  liam lady kima clarota may i suggest you take the first watch  sam laughs oh my god what if they start fucking  all laugh  taliesin so its going to be that sort of evening excellent  liam rated m for mature  matt clarota says 
none	 should you insist and clarotas image shimmers and vanishes  orion sweet  taliesin im falling asleep  matt as you guys are all going to sleep kimas still sharpening her sword and she stops for a  second and goes everyone im sorry youve lost your friend if he lives we shall find him  laura he will live  taliesin and we will find him  ashley no he will scanlan you just calm down  matt but if they have indeed taken him prisoner and emberhold is lost there is only one place  they would bring 
none	 him yugvoril  laura gasps with the dude with the black horn  matt considering the mess that youve made since entering their realm of living and work youd  make for a great gift to their current standing demigod if we arent able to find him within the  city i think that may be the next place to look  marisha once again are you afraid theyre going to take him while were asleep is this a genuine  concern is this something we should move on now  matt not as long as youre keeping concentration we 
none	 should be fine  laura im concentrating so hard  all laugh  liam were busted up  taliesin theres legitimately nothing to be done  matt theres a softness that hits kimas face and you can see a bit of a quiver to her chin and she  goes the guilt i feel for unknowingly putting you all in danger for my sake is immense its  because of me and my actions that you even delved this far and nearly lost life and limb merely at  the behest of allura and i want you all to know 
none	 that i appreciate it i really truly do  orion thats great if you can mention that to allura thatd be wonderful  matt i would really appreciate it to speak to tiberius  orion mumbles makes spell sounds returns to normal voice i would really appreciate it if you  mentioned that to allura im trying to get into her good graces and whatnot  matt she chuckles a moment and says all right allura is a good friend well weve known each  other for gods 15 years now since we defeated the scourged rider together but she 
none	 has always  had more of a political mind than i do so when we were both offered a seat on the council of  taldorei and emon she stayed and i im a woman of action and i  knew my destiny was out in the world  orion we share something in common lady kima i too have left my home and land because i did not  want to sit on the council of draconia with blessings from my father and such i gained  ambassadorship on a mission for them but really just so i could 
none	  matt her eyes have glazed over and are staring off into the distance  all laugh  orion to get all the things out and i saw this wonderful lamb in this field one time  matt i was speak to allura of your honor and deeds tiberius we try to have drinks and swap  stories every few months shes a good one  orion yes i think so  matt she takes a moment to herself and looks around at the rest of you and says the cruel  king who dealt the final blow  sam 
none	 clears throat that would be the kingslayer me  matt she steps up and walks over to you and puts a hand on your shoulder and gives you a stern look  in the eye and shakes your shoulder shes a halfling so shes not too much taller than you  all laugh  sam laughing oh okay  matt good the cruel king is down and i thank you for that she walks back to the little perch  on the rock at the side of the wall and says he tried to break me relish in his false 
none	  superiority dragging hooks across my flesh underestimating the will of a servant of  bahamut  marisha are you congratulating us for being murderers is that what youre doing right now  matt murder and justice are two entirely different things and the deities of all good saw  to it that this kings time was limited  marisha are you suggesting now that we control the wills of the deities  matt no but we enact them as long as we work within your plans to keep us safe  marisha thats mighty bold and presumptuous of you 
dung	  matt my life has been given to guidance of the platinum dragon who has not seen nothing but the  positive direction for all of your species mine and the rest of humanity that exists in the  material plane you would do well to not disrespect one who looks out for you even though  you may not look up to him for guidance the reason these lands that you grew up in are safe  and free as much as they are are because of the sacrifices of my brethren who came before me under  his 
none	 light and guidance im not saying you to worship him each one has their own gods of  choice i just say show some respect  marisha i do show respect lady kima i show respect when i feel that respect has been earned  orion shes royalty you have to understand  sam were all a bit cranky maybe we should just turn in  matt i watched as they executed my companions the wondrous men and women who came down to these  caverns at my sides with my coin in their pockets with the promise of justice 
none	 and they laughed as  they cut their throats before me hoping it would be able to crack me it was bahamuts strength  that held me there  marisha lady kima i am not saying that what we are doing here is not just i only wish that you  understand and i humbly thank you for your appreciation and thanks for coming down here to  rescue you but you are correct we have lost a friend someone who we have been through a lot  with way more than we have been with you so before we 
none	 start boasting congratulations and you  start thanking us why dont you wait and well see what happens when  we all get out of here first  liam shes suffering from ptsd why are you poking the badger  laura maybe we should just calm down and go to sleep  matt kima takes a step forward towards keyleth and as you look up at her face theres a tension  but you can see now that shes stepped near in to you towards what little bit of light seems to  cascade through this cavern there are tears 
none	 streaking down her face  laura how do you feel now  all laugh  matt they tried all they could to break me but i knew my destiny would not end here i have a  destiny that does not end here  ashley i reach out really slowly and give her a handkerchief  all laugh  ashley and then retreat  taliesin lady kima as im sure you know grief speaks before sense  marisha all im saying lady kima is that after what we have done and what we have been through  and the lives 
none	 and the blood that even i have on my hands you had better be worth it  taliesin let us wait for talk of worth and talk of might until we are reunited  matt she puts a hand up towards you child let me explain to you why we are here as while you  may have stepped into the pretense of keeping me out of harms way there is a purpose that i and  now all of us serve here in the underdark now ive been on this journey for more than a year  traveling wherever 
none	 the wind took me finding where my gift would find an end to suffering justice to  the wicked and comfort to the downtrodden id just returned from the frozen tundra northeast of  these cliffkeep mountains heading to meet with allura the same friend who brought you here  orion i pop out of my sleep did you say allura again  matt shh  orion im sorry  laura tiberius shh  matt my vision came to me im sure youre familiar with visions the great platinum dragon  bestowed upon my humble self a dream i saw 
none	 an ancient vision of the great and terrible god of  undeath himself orcus his crimson leathery skin and endless wings rumbling through the abyss  itself he had chosen a champion one that would unite the material world and the heart of the  abyss bringing a doorway of oblivion to our world he cut from his own head two of his  terrible black horns placing them upon the brow of this chosen warrior his avatar to these  realms granting him power no mortal should ever have  i saw heroes long forgotten rise up to destroy 
none	 this shadow champion losing much in the ensuing  battle loss far more than you or i will ever know the body of the avatar was burned away but  the horns of orcus remained untouched by flame blade nor divine judgement these keepers of the  horns had a title that time has taken and the whereabouts of the artifacts that had been  thankfully lost as well  until the next dream dispelled my confusion i felt a cackling entity of immense power who had  discovered one of the holding vaults never meant to be found this 
none	 creature obsessed spent all  their attention to unlock the promised treasure within and over time they did one of the two  horns had found a new champion one who now resides deeper within the underdark here one  weve now known to be called kvarn this one who has united the illithid and the duergar alike  under a banner of madness expansion and mockery of life ive seen these experiments as have you  this is what i came down here to dispose of once and for all  now i hired some of the finest warriors 
none	 in kraghammer for this all of whom have been slain  or worse that guilt weighs upon my soul and this very quest whoever this kvarn monstrosity it  holds the horn of orcus upon its brow my visions have told me that we must destroy it and must do  so soon if it had already unlocked the artifacts true potential kraghammer would be a ruin before  you even arrived but its only a matter of time we must end kvarn and retrieve this horn and  return it to the taldorei council to discuss how to seal 
none	 it once more hopefully for all of  eternity  your friends loss is a terrible thing but we will try to find him and should we not understand  that his sacrifice was not in vain for were here not to save one but thousands hundreds of  thousands of lives if we succeed so we sleep we rest we find your friend and we destroy this  this abomination this anathema  marisha lady kima i only hope you do not eventually become what you fear so much  good night  sam sleep tight  matt she 
none	 picks up her blade sits back down and goes back to sharpening  sounds of a sharpening stone hitting blade  laura that was weird right good night  taliesin that went well  sam pike ill cuddle you for warmth if that would help  ashley its already so hot in here with all the lava and stuff i would just prefer to sleep  alone im sorry  sam thats fine thats what i meant  marisha i turn into minxie form and go off in the corner and curl up in the corner  liam scanlan im 
none	 very cold  all laugh  sam you know what we better let that foot heal we better let it heal  laura trinket go sleep with vax  liam thats a good idea come here trinky trink  matt bear sounds and sniffing  liam who wants nibbles  matt trinket comes up and curls next to you the evening goes by uneventful occasionally you  stumble out of your rest keep an eye out the beacon still resides from what you can imagine a  natural body sleep cycle that youre used to passes a few begin to 
none	 wake up before the others  as you have no daylight to ascertain whether it is day or night indeed  who knows what it is at this point  orion i relieved myself in the middle of the night  laura thank you for telling us tiberius  sam did you get up  matt just wake up in a puddle of his own dragonborn filth  orion i did my dragonborn business and buried it as we do  laura so have we healed completely  matt yes youve all healed completely at this point you had an 
none	 evenings rest  sam do we get all our spells back and stuff  matt you get your spells back  marisha we have to pick them for the day right  sam i can do things again  marisha yeah hang on got to think about this  orion put some greater restorations in there  matt your mark wait your mark your hunters mark which you can feel the magic of it is  slowly waning as the spell comes to the end of its effective period is moving  laura gasps wheres it moving  matt its 
none	 moving out of the city  laura where which direction  matt best you can tell its heading towards the opposite side of the cavern towards where it  curves down deeper and below  laura wait where is that in relation to us  matt to where you guys are if youre looking out from next to the emberhold its to your right  curving down and around  laura we should go that direction  marisha i go and cast pass without a trace on us  matt all right  liam this is suddenly turning into labyrinth 
none	 beyond the goblin city  matt to take back the child which you have stolen  laura you have no power over me  sam the way we came in the city was through the side path right  matt yes the side of emberhold which you followed the curvature of this giant cavern around  and you slept on the side up against the wall using the illusion the illusory terrain  sam so were already  matt youre already away from emberhold youre on the side of the wall maybe about a quarter to  a half a 
none	 mile further down  sam but if we keep going well get to the  matt youll head down further into the cavern seemingly in the direction where her hunters mark  is currently leading which has now faded  sam okay your hunters mark is gone  laura well it went that way we should go  sam so lets go lets just hurry  laura as stealthily as possible so we dont alert the entire freaking camp  taliesin weve got pass without a trace so we should be all right  matt all right  laura i 
none	 try to make it look like we werent around this area as much as possible without our  dust of tracelessness  matt youre sweeping behind the group as theyre all moving along with your imaginary brush  liam trinkets doing that thing where he pulls with his front feet and drags with his behind  taliesin hes just rolling like a giant brillo brush  marisha i put stone shape in my ring of holding last night with my unused spells i meant to tell  you that last night  matt thats all right all right you do 
none	 that  ashley oh i forgot you had that ring  matt all right so  orion i take out my ioun stones  matt okay so your ioun stones are now slowly rotating around your head well you can only have  one up at a time  orion well i only have one  matt yeah okay good you said stones so  orion sorry pathfinder habit  matt i know so moving around your head slowly all right so the rest of you gather you cast  your spell pass without a trace you continue to crest 
dung	 along the outskirts of the cavern wall at  this point looking over you can see throughout the night most of the fortress currently the  lava fall that once contained it is completely cooled and is dark it looks like their way of  stopping the flow was to stop the entire magma fall who knows how much damage has been done but  currently the flow is halted and you can see now theres a number of parties of duergar that are  wandering out through the cavern presumably in search for you  laura so technically lady 
none	 kima we might be able to get back in eventually and get your weapon  matt as you say that she grins to herself and says i would like that very much i had some  sentimental value to that equipment  laura and theres a vault  matt and there is a vault  sam unless it melted  liam this will greatly enhance your ability to move forward with us wont it  matt i think right now time is of the essence for your friend more than anything  laura we should go look for grog  
none	 matt besides i highly doubt that that stronghold has been left alone just because its  filled with rock  liam maybe on the way out  matt okay so as you guys progress on the side i would like everybody to roll  a stealth check please  laura oh i dont know which one to roll  matt you still have disadvantage but you have advantage with your cloak so youre neutralized  youre a normal roll right now  marisha softly stealth check  ashley we have advantage  marisha you have plus ten  matt no 
none	 you have disadvantage still  ashley i do not theres no plus anything  sam plus ten  ashley ten still  orion 29  liam plus ten  matt plus ten  orion 29  sam 19  marisha 33  taliesin 17  ashley 21  laura 24  liam 33  laura oh i didnt roll for trinket hold on  liam oh trinket rolled a one  laura trinket shush oh i didnt feed him today hes probably so hungry  sam have any of us eaten  ashley weve rested  matt essentially as opposed 
none	 to having this minutiae of reminding you all to eat i just  consider when you rest and take short rests youre snacking and resting otherwise we  communally spend ten minutes a game talking about what you ate if food begins to become  scarce which it may in time ill let you know  liam foot flakes anyone foot flakes  matt its like pork rinds chuckles all right so as you continue down this cavern you begin to  see the search parties in the distance and you keep low and watch as they pass some of 
none	 them have  small that red glowish stone torches set out to keep their vision about you can see a few of the  parties returning to the city eventually you guys begin to crest down deeper and dropping into  a small decline as this giant almost hatchback cavern where most of the duergar civilization is  built in comes to an end you begin to travel deeper deeper into the underdark caverns below as  youre continuing forward you find a very very familiar scent catches your attention immediately  as youre tracking through trying to keep your 
none	 attention on possibly any sign of grog its the  smell of blood its the smell of fresh blood freshish  laura freshish  matt freshish blood if you will you smell freshish blood you immediately glance over and  you can see on the side of this cavern which is about 50 60 feet wide at this point as its come  to a pinching point leading downward you can see a spatter of blood across the wall to your  immediate left and what looks like a mangled mass of what once was a duergar currently just torn 
none	  asunder across this rock wall  laura oh no  marisha does it look to be natural done by an animal or does it look like people with weapons  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  laura the only time ive seen duergar split across like this was when we saw the camp of that  creepy centipede creature  liam with the stalagmite coming up  laura yeah  marisha ten  laura do i see any of those kind of tracks around  matt you check and look around on the ground as well 
none	 you unfortunately as you look around  youre not able to pick up the fine details you however just being naturally understanding of the  underdark as well as having the previous knowledge of inspecting the initial camp yes  these tracks are very similar you see what looks like these strange dragging marks on the ground  these elongated ones no footprints occasionally you see what looks like a humansized footprint as  well and then these drag marks you also notice that there is just beyond the rock threshold as  you step over towards the wall you 
none	 see three other duergar bodies that are torn asunder many  of them partially eaten and violently torn apart some parts are scarred some sort of acidic burn  and you see tooth marks you see claw marks and you see portions of limbs that have been pulled  off by sheer force  marisha could i do a nature check to see if i would know of a creature that could do this  matt you certainly can  laura its going to be that centipede creature thingy  marisha ooh 26  matt 26 its weird there are 
none	 elements of the drag marks on the ground that resemble a creature  that has pseudopods or some sort of a tentaclelike mass but you know of no natural  creature that also has this power this type of hunting technique nor would be this far  underground  taliesin i think its another stitch monster  liam yes  laura stitch monster  taliesin stitch monster  laura i like it  taliesin i do too  laura its a good name  marisha something tentacley though nothing ever good is tentacley  laura can i tell if grog 
none	 definitely came this way  matt go ahead and make a tracking check so just go ahead and roll a d20 you have advantage  because youre in the underdark  laura what do i add that to  matt it should be under your tracking ability under your ranger abilities there  in your spells under you ranger abilities ill see if i find it before you  laura i dont understand  matt its on the sheet i gave you with all your character stuff  laura oh okay cool  matt that one the one thats easiest 
none	  laura natural explorer primeval awareness  matt okay  laura i dont have any idea what im looking for  all laugh  laura im just looking at words right now  matt its a survival check there you go  laura its a survival check  matt you have advantage on it  laura okay oh good so thats 22  matt 22 all right looking around what you do find is there is a very familiar scent that a  goliath barbarian does have you using trinkets help as you yourself are not quite as attuned  
none	 trinket does pick up a little bit of grogs scent in this pathway so trinket moans gives you a  nudge and points deeper down the cavern and you can see what looks to be a smattering of small  duergarsized feet and two grooves  laura two grooves  matt about twoinchwide grooves that continue down the path  laura i wonder if they have him prisoner now if he came out of his mind funk  marisha wheel tracks  matt it could very well be wheel tracks  orion or theyre dragging his body  matt theyre 
none	 consistent and their width is consistent  marisha their width is consistent and they seem clean  sam theyve put him on some sort of stretcher thing  marisha yeah sounds like they have him on yeah a trailer  laura lovely well grog definitely came this way as did the stitch monster so you dont have  much choice but to follow  taliesin lets continue  orion shall we  taliesin all right  laura be aware were all very aware of  marisha things  laura any movement at all happening  taliesin guys stuff  matt 
none	 keeping your eyes peeled you travel for another two and a half hours down this cavern  path it grows tighter at points where you can only really fit three or four individuals through  its about 20 25 feet wide then opens up sporadically into other small pockets where the  natural topography of this portion of this underdark cavern structure seems to weave and  bend the warmth and that sulfurous smell that was intrinsic to the duergar portion of this cavern  that you were so used to begins to slowly fade and temperature begins to drop 
none	 still  uncomfortable but its growing more humid as opposed to dry heat  orion its so good  matt after another hour of travel keeping your eyes out the temperature drops significantly and  is actually quite cold the heat in the volcanic portion of this cavern structure apparently has  passed you now and youve hit an area of the rock where it is a much more chilled much more  ominous  orion its humid still  matt human  orion humid  matt humid the humidity begins to fade as well the air becomes a dry 
none	 cold  orion so were past that  matt you eventually using which by the way the only light source you have going forward is the  light from your staff  orion oh light  matt i assume youve had it up this whole time or youve been walking in the darkness  orion oh yes of course  matt chuckles you continue down and the topography which was once the black jagged  obsidian flooring of the previous portion of the underdark begins to give way to a more natural  gray sandtype texture your feet sink about 
none	 a quarter inch or so with each step and you get  about ten 15 feet before the color of the sand and the texture changes dramatically it looks  almost like a peppering of small whitishyellow stones and rocks as well as bits of black and  grey its like a giant rocky pit out in front of you  marisha what  liam meaning its all solid stone that color or loose gravel and rock  matt you find sand and then the sand eventually gives way to like larger pieces of these rocks and  stones  
none	 marisha so its like a pebble ball pit in front of us  matt essentially  taliesin im looking for signs of mining  matt okay go ahead and make an investigation check  orion im going to make an arcana check also  taliesin 15  matt 15 checking the walls immediately in your vicinity you see there are signs of mining but  theyre old they havent been used in a while you can see some veins that are dried up looks  like maybe the duergar had business down here mining  marisha does it look like 
none	 there can i do a nature check to see if this is an old lake bed  like there is a river bed  matt sure go and do that what did you roll  orion 11  matt what are you checking  orion for arcana  matt what are you checking  orion just general if i feel a general source of sinister magic anywhere  matt nothing arcane seems to emanate from the vicinity  liam vexahlia you know the underdark are there any critters crawling around in that pit  laura is this still the underdark 
none	  matt you seem to be still in the underdark but the underdark in general youre familiar with  your training and studying on the denizens of it what things to look for this is not a natural or  overall occurrence youve read about before  laura i cant sense anything or any creatures nearby  matt not per se  marisha i rolled a 16  matt rolled a 16 as youre looking around you go and inspect the stones what you do notice is  theyre not stones there are pieces of glass little shards of actual 
none	 volcanic glass scattered  across this entire field mixed with an endless seemingly sea of small bone chunks  laura ugh  marisha chunks  laura great  matt pieces of bone that have been rounded off ground broken  orion bone petals  matt theyre ancient  marisha okay so there appears to be are there any whole pieces of bones big femurs or skulls  sam this was some sort of burial ground  matt its hard to see most of the bones that have been here have been around long enough to  the point where theyve 
none	 eroded been broken destroyed over and over again to the point where  you cant discern any of the original creatures they may have come from its just a sea of bone  obsidian glass and small bits of stone that have fallen from the actual nearby cavern  liam can we see any sort of civilized construction here or is this all the work of  nature or some living thing  matt go ahead and make a perception check  liam 18  matt 18 you look past the barrier of his light spell because you can only 
none	 get a little bit past  that due to your elven lowlight vision you do notice there are occasionally some spires of  natural rock some stalagmites that are jutting out in the distance and you see what looks like  some semblance of a ruined wall just beyond the edge of the vision like a crumbled small wall  laura can i use my primeval awareness and see if i can sense grog within six miles of us  matt certainly all right so how does your primeval awareness work miss ranger  laura oh i can use an 
none	 action to focus my awareness on a region around me and then i can  sense whether oh well no its only certain types of creatures  matt right which are  liam like goliath  laura well no it says aberrations celestials dragons elementals fey fiends and undead  liam that still might be useful even if it doesnt find grog  matt what you do gather you do sense a very strong force of aberrationbased much further  like five miles ahead way ahead and you have this weird okay good to know you dont sense  anything 
town	 else but you do sense a general presence about this entire sea of bone  ashley ive been here  marisha what  ashley i was here in the vision  laura really  ashley yes it was a field of broken glass and bone and i feel like this is it  laura so what do we do  ashley and then after that i got to a cavern of blue crystal  laura so we have to go beyond it  marisha so were on the right road  ashley i think we have to go beyond this 
none	  taliesin all right  orion well lets keep moving then  laura can we keep to the edge and try to not disturb the rock as much as possible  matt as you move to either edge you can see the wall comes to a straight meeting with this aside  from the climbing the walls proper you have no other way of traversing this  liam could you describe the dimensions of this one more time  matt yes the cavern itself is about 120 to 150 feet wide you dont see the ceiling right now  laura 
none	 oh its that high  liam so from our left to our right 150 feet  matt correct  liam and is it a big circular shape  matt from what you can tell it just opens up and then continues and then darkness you cannot see  beyond it  laura are there any rocks around us any big rocks  matt there are a couple of small spires about 60 70 feet out  laura anything loose anything i can grab near us  matt around you most everything thats grabbable are part of it yeah  ashley

none	 anybody send light up and see  how high the ceiling goes  orion mumbles shoot an arrow if you would vex please wherever you wish  laura okay  orion light  matt okay cast out an arrow as it shoots over arcs through the air you get a look of the  cavern you can see its a large arched natural cavern with a number of hanging stalactites at the  top it goes up arcs past and then lands probably about a half a mile down the way really  nice shot  laura thanks  matt 
town	 and it lands with a impact noise with what little bit you can see through the arc this  path just continues and continues and continues for that full half mile  laura theres no way to avoid it  marisha theres no way to avoid it  matt you do get a nice view of what looks to be more of these little central pieces of broken  wall looks like there was either a small series of structures or buildings that were built once  within this cavern that have all completely crumbled to ruin with but a 
none	 few small bastions of  foundation that still remain  laura tiberius how many times can you cast pillars of whatever pillars  orion grand columns is the spell vex  laura how many times can you cast grand columns  orion multiple times i guess  laura could we potentially walk on columns across this thing potentially  marisha i mean i could wall of bend us a stone wall thats and we could just walk along the path  but it goes only so far  orion hold on a second ive got something here  liam were 
town	 seeing the remains of buildings scattered throughout maybe we could go from  laura what about a wall from out from the side  marisha the side and then we walk along that side  laura yeah  marisha yeah we could do that right  matt how big is the wall you can make  laura what were you going to say  liam well theres little islands of structure left we could just  laura hop  liam stand bridge stand bridge stand bridge  marisha i can go 120 feet i can make about 120 feet wall 
none	  matt you saw about a quarter to a half mile this seems to continue  laura so that might not be enough  sam shed have to do it 20 times  taliesin i think we may just have to walk gingerly  marisha maybe we can fashion  ashley should we find traps check for traps  marisha can we fashion snow boots  liam vax starts feeling along one side of the wall does the ground look firm and more stable on  the edges or is it all just the same  matt do you step 
none	 out a little bit into the area  liam hand on the wall  matt hand on the wall i mean its a wall  liam no but i mean yes  matt but you step out with your hand on the wall  liam im not stepping out yet im looking at the ground is it pebbles and rock  all the way to the sides  matt all the way up to the wall  marisha okay  orion lady keyleth if you will could you perhaps make a flat sturdy stone tablet we could  all particularly

none	 trinket is not necessarily pleased but will deal with it  marisha well hes so cute  laura hes so cute  orion in draconia those are snacks  sam i wouldnt say that  laura lets go come on lets get on this thing grogs getting ahead of us  sam all right lets go on our stone airplane  marisha lets get on the wonkavator everybody  ashley all right hop on i hop on  matt all right so you all hop onto this giant stone its really cramped youre all  shouldertoshoulder pushed onto here clutched 
none	 onto your new persian cat kima and clarota step  onto it  orion i cast telekinesis on the stone slab lift us up and push us  matt okay how much weight can you push through telekinesis  orion a thousand  matt okay  orion i did all the math clears throat vax weighs 155 pike weighs 75 taliesin weighs 190  vex weighs 120  ashley but scanlan weighs nothing  orion sam weighs the same 75 keyleth weighs 125  matt yep kima weighs 105 with all of her armor shed be 105  sam clarota 
none	 can float  matt clarota can float does that still fall under a thousand total  orion yeah should is that right  sam what about you  taliesin plus the rock  laura the rock would be less  orion thats why i kept a hundred pounds for that  marisha a hundred pounds for the rock  liam want to run those numbers again for the calculator  matt rocks 100 pounds thats not a lot of stone  laura its a very thin piece of stone  matt thats a very thin piece of stone all right 
none	  orion nine nope were at nine were there were at ninesomething you can do all the math  but its ninesomething  matt okay all right so you all stand on the platform it straining noises rises up and its  one of those all of you have to gather yourself but nevertheless it is now floating how long does  it last concentration wise  orion ten minutes  matt all right  laura quick float us  matt so as tiberius begins to concentrate the stone begins to glide out over this expanse of  broken bone 
none	 and obsidian glass  orion i hover about whats bone break around six feet above the air  thats how high i take it  matt okay so youre cresting about six feet you have to move it around occasionally to avoid some  of the large stalagmites that are jutting out of the bones  laura do we see anything im keeping an eye out see if i see any movement or anything thats maybe  sparkles i dont know  taliesin keeping an eye behind us as well  matt okay you guys keeping an eye out you 
none	 see more and more of this ruin and you can see the  the further in you go you start seeing bits of bone that are larger than whats near the edge  you start seeing bits and pieces that are full bones so theyve been more still rounded and  weathered but theyre less ground down as supposed to the edges where most of the traction  seems to be you get about 300 feet out before you hear a loud echoing scream across the cavern  loud yell  orion in front of us  matt in front 
none	 of you guys  laura whats it sound like  matt its male and its loud  laura go can we go faster  orion we hear this i push us forward i mean were going in that direction anyways so i speed  us up  liam keyleth take the gnomes  matt correct okay as you speed up and continue  ashley i jump on keyleth  liam take the gnomes  matt okay  ashley grab some feathers  sam ill grab on as well why not  matt all right so keyleth you transform maintaining concentration 
none	 on polymorph for  trinket i believe right all right its not a spell its an effect you do so you whooshing  noise you transform into a giant eagle you grab both the gnomes you guys are lifted up off the  platform as the platform continues to push forward  orion cool so i get a little bit more control over it now grunts  matt a little bit more as youre pushing forward you feel the stone itself has this weird wobble to  it but you still manage to keep concentration pushing forward eventually the little 
none	 bit of  light from your light spell cascades past one of these joining parts of a wall and then beyond  that you can see what looks like a few other stone pillars that are sticking up and you see what  looks to be a small party of duergar that are in the middle of battle  there is one duergar who is splattered across the bone floor you see a troll that is currently in  the middle of a fistfight with something thats moving extremely fast this blur of motion you  can barely make out 
none	 the physical form before the troll turns and runs in your direction surprised  to see the light coming towards you and in its expression of extreme confusion and fear you see  something whoosh past and its head just soft falling sound rolls off the top of his  shoulders  laura thats not grog were going to toward a monster  matt crashing sound the troll body hits the ground as it does you see bits of bone begin to  rise up and pull the troll down underneath  laura oh its really good were not standing 
none	 on it  orion avoid whooshing sound  liam daggers out  taliesin guns out  matt as you guys begin to push forward you can see two of the duergar are now backing up  instinctually one looks down at his feet now that have been grabbed and hes being pulled under  and he just starts trying to wrestle himself free this blur of motion jumps off one of the  platforms spins in the air and lands with a slam that completely splatters across the rock that  hes right next to this duergar you can see 
none	 part of his jaw go flying off to the side and silence  hits him in the middle of his scream  the last duergar there you can see whos looking around sees the stone platform and goes let me  on let me on he goes running over and is trying to jump up towards the stone platform  you guys are on  laura how much does he weigh giggles  matt well hes going to go ahead and try and grab it with an athletics check he makes it  latching noise he gets onto the side 
none	  sam kick him off  marisha fuck that guy  laura i punch him in the face  matt okay okay you go ahead and punch thud noise you just beat him in the face he holds  tight youre not a very strong person unfortunately  liam i grab him by the cloak what is it what is it  matt i dont know get it away get it away  marisha in eagle form im going to do a nice high soaring lap  sam were on you  marisha i know its okay im going to 
none	 use my im soaring high its an easy breeze were on  the people mover okay and im going to use my keen sight to see if i can get a good pew  matt okay so using that you glance down and in this brief moment where it seems like the  cacophony of this entire circumstance slows down slowing sound noise and your eagle eyes glance  down and you can see in a brief moment the blur stops you see a humanoid form looking at the  body and the torso it looks elven its very thin 
none	 and gaunt legs dangling as four giant  jaggedlooking tentacles sprout from both sides of its torso holding it aloft  two lifting it off the ground and keeping its body suspended while two are fwhoosh whipping around  in the process as youre glancing you see its head cracking noise glance up toward the wall  these blank white eyes shooting around in different directions spontaneously with this  maddening look whatever this is is clearly insane and is currently driven on some sort of hunger  bloodlust the stitch marks you see across its body are very reminiscent 
none	 of the earlier  abominations that you saw created by kvarn and sent throughout this cavern structure  liam keyleths the only one who sees it though at this moment  orion do i see it  matt you guys havent yet at the moment youre talking to this dwarf or youre shoving him off  the platform  orion can i see it as im cruising through i see him  laura we wanted to throw him as far as we could  liam yes the twins pull him up and one  liam and laura two three  
none	 matt laughs all right as you chuck the duergar through the air the creature who briefly had  stopped and you guys now see its motion stop and you get a full view of its horrible form  grunting panting sounds  orion as soon as i do that i cast true strike ftsssh  matt all right you cast true strike on yourself  orion on him  matt on him  orion what it does is it allows me to seekeep going ill tell you go ahead  matt all right so it stops for a second you 
none	 guys all get a view of its vision as its looking  up towards where keyleth is suddenly its head shh snaps back into focus as the duergar goes  swinging through the air as it does snarling it licks its lips and you can see now where its  mouth is the lips curl back and the jaw splits open slightly with this horrible predatorlike  fanged jaw and the two tentacles that are currently up in the air reach out grab and  tshhh just split it in two  its torso then divides and sprays it with 
none	 crimson as it tongue flicking noise licks it out of the  air breathy growling  laura whispering go faster go faster  orion im still going were still going im not standing and watching  sam have we passed it yet  matt everyone roll initiative  laura oh my god were going to fight were going to fight this thing  marisha i was going to say we should try and avoid him poop monster  laura oh god  sam no were floating above it weve got advantage  marisha do we  laura were all stuck 
none	 on a single piece of rock  orion yeah well thats the thing  sam were fine one of us has guns  matt all right  liam and we saw the duergar get pulled under by skeletal arms  sam by the bones  liam yeah the bones pulled down right so its not just this thing  matt im using this as the figure for the creature  orion by the way matthew  matt yes  orion true strike i extend my hand and point a finger at a target my magic grants me a brief  
none	 insight into the targets defenses on my next turn i gain advantage on my first attack roll  against the creature using that spell as a guide  matt gotcha so for the purposes of this the two gnomes are alongside keyleths eagle form  taliesin oh were going to use the little thingy  marisha yeah are we going to use the levitating thingies  matt what yes we are let me pull them out right now over here  taliesin levitating thingies  marisha levitating thingies makes us look cool  taliesin its been so long  laura 
none	 ooh i like it  matt theres the rest of you although trinket is a kitten  sam trinket is a cat  taliesin trinket only has the power of adorability  matt this is the stone slab over here that you guys have created all right so initiative  rolls everyone starting at 25 to 20  laura 21  matt all right that puts vex at the top of the round there and brings there we go 20 to 15  liam 17  orion 18  matt 18 15 to ten  sam 12  matt ten 
none	 to five  marisha eight  taliesin eight  matt laughs okay  marisha team eight  taliesin boom  matt pike what did you get  ashley four  laura yay  matt okay yay pike bringing up the rear  marisha team single digits  ashley team single digits  taliesin well get there  matt top of the round is the monstrosity it is a very quick move the camera follow me this way  there we go  all laugh  matt it uses its quite grand movement of 50 feet to shh lumber over to 
none	 this side and it  gets two attacks with its tentacles with reach actually three attacks  marisha on who  matt this is going to be at you guys  liam i dont need this foot  matt this is going to be one at kima one at you and one at tiberius as you are the three currently  within its positioning view first one is going to be at you  liam okay  matt oh that is going to be a 14 to hit  liam no  matt all right so you whoosh dodge out 
none	 of the way the one towards kima oh thats going to be a  15 to hit which it strikes her armor but she manages to pull out of the way and it gleans off  the side and you can see a little bit of this acid scarring across the edge of her leather armor the  third strike going out towards tiberius swoosh that is laughs a critical one it actually whips  out and strikes the bottom of the stone you guys are standing on which rocks it for a second and  you all essentially get 
none	 worried but it seems to have no effect that was a really terrible opening  round for the creature  marisha heres my question is this all happening still over top of the bone pit  matt oh yeah  marisha okay  matt that brings us to vex  laura hunters mark  matt all right so you mark him  laura right on that guy  matt do it he is hunters marked and im putting this on here as a reminder of your mark  laura okay  taliesin its so fashionable  matt isnt it though 
none	  laura im going to lightning arrow him oh i cant do that because i hunters marked him  matt correct that was your bonus action  laura im going to hail of thorns that guy  matt all righty thorn hail him  laura okay at level three  matt okay  laura through my bow of blazing bowstring  matt okay so as you pull back your arrow you pull it up you can see the thorns thoosh  actually grow rather rapidly out of the wood itself and as you pull back the bowstring itself  ignites 
none	 setting the bow the shaft of the arrow on fire as well as you release rolling  laura 22  matt 22 to hit  laura yes  matt that hits  laura yes  ashley yeah  laura so then i roll my regular damage plus 3d10  matt correct plus the fire damage which is 1d10  laura okay whoa so 14 for the first  matt okay and then roll technically 4d10 because its the fire  laura 4d10 this is crazy  matt yeah  laura four 11 19 21  matt so 21 plus 14 
none	  laura yes  matt 35 points of damage nice so you release soosh  laura oh plus hunters mark damage  matt yep there you go thats why you did it  laura six  matt nice 41 points of damage in the first attack from the ranger  marisha cheers  matt all righty so you release the arrow as the creature woosh shifts into place it lashes out  with all its tentacles and as it pulls back looks like its ready to pounce you release the arrow  right towards its torso it hits and it 
none	 looks down instinctually and it bursts into a spray of  thorns all over its face and its torso and you can see it monster screech reels back from the pain  you can see the flames licking up over the front of its body you can see theres a semblance of  clothing on it whatever this thing once was its still wearing the clothing it had and a portion of  it has burned off part of the torso whoever this poor soul once was there is no shred of humanity  left in it  orion before 
none	 that ends i go hop off  laura hop off no way im not stepping on this bone shit  liam theres undead things in there  laura thats my turn  matt and thats your turn and youre holding a kitten  laura oh hes tucked into my armor  matt oh hes tucked into you okay that brings us to tiberius youre up  tiberius what are you doing  liam tibberhoods  matt what you got  orion okay everyone hold on tight  sam youre giving us opposite notes  matt what you got  orion 
none	 how wide was the stone tablet ten feet for all of us to fit on  matt its about 15 feet round  orion perfect i move us right above the butthole and everybody hold on and i fucking slam all  of us right on him boosh  matt okay so the platform comes cascading down at a fair speed immediately breaking over this  creature as it is a pretty thin wall to have only been about 100 pounds it completely shatters over  the top of it everyone who was on that platform go ahead and make 
none	 a dexterity check  ashley get it guys come on  laura i get two because its favored terrain right  matt correct  laura yes okay good  matt all right so  liam 17  laura 23  matt oh pikes not there  taliesin 24  ashley im not happening for a while  orion me too  matt yes  orion 12  matt 12 all right so all the rest of you manage to leap off and tumble the best you can to catch  yourself except for tiberius  orion wait do i make 
none	 a dexterity check i mean im not okay  matt you do youre still on the platform it just shattered around you so you however fall  prone on the ground from the impact and land on the ground thats also going to end your turn  marisha did it do any damage  orion can i not do any bonus actions  matt unfortunately not due to the failed dexterity save it practically knocked the wind  out of you due to the impact  orion okay  matt that was the unfortunate part of missing that dexterity check 
none	  orion okay  matt however it does deal from the crushing damage to the entity thatll be ill say 3d10  points of damage ill see if it makes its save to reduce to half which it does rolled a 21 whats  your dc in your spell  orion 17  matt so it makes its save so its half damage roll 3d10 and its half that  orion counting noises what is that 19  matt okay so it takes a total of nine points of damage crushing damage from the blow of the stone  on 
none	 top of it nice as it crssh shrugs off bits of chunks of stone that are around its body you  can see a little bit of blood is being pulled to the seams of its body its taken some hits its  still doing all right but its definitely you can see its not impervious by any means that  brings us to vax  liam all right well i use my bonus action to click my boots of haste together  matt your boot of haste  liam boot of haste but arent magic items resistant to  
none	 matt oh yeah i was messing around  liam okay yeah start sneak attack from behind 32 for the first attack  matt you unfortunately do not get sneak attack on this it knows where you are you do not get the  round before it nobody else is adjacent to it because everyone else had to  jump off the platform  liam so no ones right next to it im the closest one  matt currently no you are the closest one to it because everyone had to jump off as it fell and  the fact that 
none	 as soon as you rush towards it its head cracking noise clicked over its back and  looked straight at you almost the neck bending in the process  liam you block me every chance you get with this one so that was the first attack  matt no this creature is really quick and very  aware of its surroundings  liam so first attack is nine theres more coming here comes the poison dagger which is 23  matt 23 that does hit  liam that is ten because of the boots of haste i get a third 
none	 attack  matt you do  liam and that misses entirely in fact i think i threw my dagger into the bones  matt what did you roll a one  liam a one yeah  matt okay so the first strike hits the second one you feel the poison energy pulse through the  blade whats the dc on that again  liam its 15  matt that hits you feel the poison crssh enter its side and it looks down oh it is immune to  poison sorry oh abyssal abominations so the second blade goes in the 
none	 third one you go ahead  and swing towards it and it splssh actually slaps the blade out of your hand and sticks to the  ceiling whoosh thankfully it returns back to your belt because magical belts are cool  all right cool that ends your turn kimas turn kima who just managed to land grabs her sword  and reaches over you can see the divine energy instilled within her blade she is going to make  two attacks against the creature she rushes towards it on that side there its going to be  yeah 17 thatll 
none	 hit thats 27 to hit and then a natural 20 so a hit and a critical shes  going to go ahead and get 15 damage from the first strike second one is going to be  marisha we need to get off this floor real bad  sam well youre not on it  marisha im not  sam you can make a dance floor next to them  matt all right as she strikes it both times with the sword you can see the first strike hits and  the second one she swings around and she instills 
none	 with her divine smite which does an additional  eight points of divine damage the second strike as it slashes across you can see the torso splits  open as the torso opens up you can see a part of its guts spill out and they begin to slowly pull  themselves back in  marisha hell no  sam shes wolverine  matt laughs scanlan youre up  sam okay do i have a clean line of sight on her or are we too far away  matt you guys are up in the air being held by her 
none	 probably actually id say  marisha im doing the eagle glide  matt you guys are about 30 feet up right now  laura oh man  sam all right so i think im in range im just going to blind the bitch  so i cast blindness on her  matt okay whats the range on that  laura its a girl  ashley its a her  sam isnt it a girl  matt no its a male elf  sam yeah well im so demeaning to it i call it a girl  ashley and laura why 
tavern	 is that demeaning  sam because it is a chauvinist i know that  matt whats the range on that scanlan  sam im looking  ashley disadvantage on his roll  liam youre in the wrong group to being saying that shit man  all laugh  sam im drunk  marisha whatever laughs  sam how far am i i cant even tell i cant see the board  matt youre about 70 feet  sam i cant do it  matt you can hold your turn if you want to wait for keyleth to go  sam 
none	 i can hold my turn ive never done this before  matt yeah meaning if youre waiting for someone else to take their turn first you can hold back  until they do theirs so you can wait for her to pull you closer  sam okay i will wait for that then and i love women  ashley oh we know we know  sam biblically  marisha keyleth does a little dip really quick  matt all right gotcha  marisha makes scanlan a little nervous  matt all right clarota takes his turn clarota is going to 
none	 the situations too dangerous to do  anything lightning bolt related clarota instead is going to use mind blast against the creature  no thats no good either at this positioning yeah no because hell  get a bunch of you guys too  sam god clarota  marisha clarota  matt instead clarota is going to  laura can he heal us  matt no clarotas not really the healing kind clarota is going to cast blur on himself to try  and keep it from taking one of these points of wound damage so he uses his turn 
none	 to cast blur  clarotas form begins to shift and vibrate in and out of place where its hard to see exactly where  clarota is standing clarota is going to take two steps back unfortunately in the threat range of  the creature it gets whoosh a reaction to attack against clarota thanks to the blur spell  though it misses entirely so the strike strikes and it passes through with no effect clarota  moves behind one of the rocks here actually this far for cover that ends clarotas turn keyleth  youre up  marisha okay i 
none	 cawcaw closer  matt like over where  marisha yeah theres good shit cant cast any spells unless i land im going to have to drop  down can i perch on one of these stalactites  matt you can but youre going to have to let go of the gnomes to do so  ashley do it  marisha can i drop off you guys  ashley yep  matt you hear bird noises  sam what  marisha and i drop them off really quick  ashley what did she say  matt all right so both of

none	 im going to do grasping vine then no i should make us a dance  floor im going to make us a dance floor then im going to do a wall of stone how concentrated  can i do my wall of stone actually can i do a wall of stone to where its doughnutshaped where  theres a hole in the middle and now i make a wall going across the top  taliesin a doughnut of stone  matt i would say based on the description of it here  marisha a horizontal wall  matt ten foot 
none	 by ten foot panels  sam panels squares  matt alternatively you can create ten foot by 20 foot panels that are only three inches thick so  yes you can you can create any shape you desire so you can make it a doughnut hole type thing if  you want to  marisha dope so im going to make a doughnutshaped dance floor and im going to make  a hole in the middle to where hes still in the middle in the bone but were all on rock around  this area  matt so its just 
none	 around all of you guys or underneath everybody  marisha underneath us  matt okay  marisha im making a dance floor  sam that was an excellent move by a strong independent woman who doesnt need a man to tell  her what to do or to validate her in any way  marisha i want everybody  matt you might not be able to get pike  marisha i cant get pike  matt no because there would be a weird loop there  ashley i can maybe try to sprinters boots my way up  marisha well 
none	 as much as i can do but i want to make a nice hole to where hes still  matt i would say you can either get pike or you can get these guys here thats about where youre  going to call it  ashley no worries do some damage  matt what are you going to do  marisha im going to boost up pike shes halfway underground  matt the wall comes out and it stops there thats as far as you can get it this whole area  now is a wall it pops you out 
none	 of the stone as the stone lifts you up you have to catch yourself for  a second but its not so abrupt to the point where you get knocked off the side youre all  lifted up about ten feet so just mark that area as stone wall got it  marisha except for douchebag  matt except for douchebag  sam now that im within range may i go  matt after percy and then its your turn you all get to hold at the same time so percy  taliesin does he get an attack of opportunity 
none	 if i run  matt you dont know  taliesin how close am i i cant see  matt it took one reaction against clarota  liam youre further than five feet away because had you been five feet away i could have sneak  attacked  taliesin oh well all right the first thing im going to do is shoot twice in the face of this  asshole  matt okay go for it  marisha shoot twice into the face of the asshole percy  taliesin 14  matt 14 does not hit unfortunately  taliesin but 28 
none	 will  matt 28 will so the first shot you shoot the body just goes sound of air splitting speed and  totally unnatural sense sees where the aim is and is already out of the way before the bullet gets  there returns but you catch it up with the second shot from the pepperbox and blast in the  side of its chest go ahead and roll damage  taliesin oh my god this is awful six  matt six points of damage all righty  taliesin thats just embarrassing  laura thats something thats something percy  
none	 ashley hey you know what were getting close  laura thats better than a one  marisha pike is just an inspirational poster today like its okay we can do it  taliesin thanks mom all right thanks mom im going to try to make a run for it to the  stalactite by your hand  matt right here  taliesin if i could even climb up on it that would be very cool  matt thats going to with your run speed youre going to have to do that next turn  taliesin okay thats fine  matt

none	 up and completely cascade  over the white almost soulless freaking out eyes of this creature its very silent hill in the way  it moves suddenly its eyes shhh noise fill over with darkness and you can see it beginning  to writhe and move around like its unable to truly grasp the full surroundings it appears to  have taken effect  orion nice  sam and then i give a little inspiration to pike i look over to her give her a little wink little  smile  liam spirit her on with anger good job  
none	 matt take your 1d8 inspiration  ashley 1d8 okay  sam thats all it takes  marisha thats all it takes laughs  matt all right that ends your turn scanlan  sam i think so  matt youre going to stay right there  sam where am i  matt youre on top of the wall right here  sam yeah im staying on that wall yeah i dont want to go anywhere yeah  matt okay pike youre up  ashley okay so from where im at  matt yes on top of this wall here  ashley

none	 you cant add that to damage its only to hit  sam save it for later  ashley so 19  matt 19 so as you look down you grab your holy symbol and even though it is cracked  you still feel the presence of sarenrae looking down upon you the divine energy coalesces in your  hand and you throw it forward with a divine wrath as it streaks across the air it slams into the  side of this weird twisting abomination and as it blasts into it you can see its tentacles reel back  and 
none	 pull back in severe pain and it roars this horrible screeching bleeegrh screech scream  into the cavern around you echoing down the hall its looking a little rough  ashley okay and then theres nothing i can do from there right  matt thats your action you can move if youd like move along the wall or hop off it or  whatever you want to do  sam come closer to me  ashley ill stay  all laugh  matt all right  marisha because shes an independent woman  sam thats a proud choice and i 
none	 honor and respect it i love women  matt so currently because its  marisha pikes not the only one cashing karma points  matt so technically i should have remembered this but you hit anyway while its blinded  attacks against it have advantage  laura oh okay  matt and its attacks have disadvantage so as a note top of the round now the  monstrosity goes ahead and gets its round its going to go ahead and lash outward thinks people  are around it seeing the wall go up its going to swing out towards you 
none	 all right that is a 16  versus armor class nice so as it swings out towards you on the wall you duck out of  the way just in time a second tendril whoosh swish reaches out and is going ahead and head  forward lets see this ones probably going to make its way either between your foot or scanlan  on the wall im going to roll to see who it goes for goes for tiberius that is 16 versus armor  class again  orion no 17  matt 17 nice lets see  laura on 
none	 the ground you look up like  orion no my big toe bah  matt third strike is going to whip around and attempt to grab roll between both okay its  going to go for lady kima and thats a natural 20  laura oh  taliesin shes a magnet  marisha even with disadvantage  matt well actually no technically it wouldve still been a 15 so its not a critical but it  still hits  marisha thats good  matt unfortunately without her full armor her ac is not that crazy so its not a critical 
none	  thats nice that brings it to a total of 18 points of damage with an additional six acid  damage to lady kima  laura oh acid none of us have gotten hit yet  matt and the tentacle whoosh wraps around her and grapples her in place and shes currently  held in place by its tentacle she stays where she is it is now going to attempt to leap away it  brings all of its tentacles to the ground and whoosh leaps up into the air  liam attacking before it goes  matt you get 
none	 one attack of opportunity against it  liam 27  matt 27 does hit  orion i swing at it with my cane as im on the floor  matt no  sam do i get an attack  liam 11  matt 11 points of damage all right it takes 11 and it leaps away whoosh taking her with it  and here its actually going to land about there and you can see as it leaps away and lands the  wounds you guys have left on it are slowly healing  marisha son of a bitch  
none	 matt vex youre up  laura all right i dont want to hit lady kima with any of my attacks so im just going to have  to do im going to do the blazing bowstring again  matt okay  laura and im going to attack it twice  matt all right go for it roll for strikes  laura ooh that was a 30  matt you have advantage on these strikes by the way well actually let me see because i think  it gets a save each turn to try to get rid of your blindness 
none	 which it does not make  orion nice is he blind  matt okay so still blinded  laura 29  matt hits definitely  laura and 23  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage on both attacks first one with the extra d10 for blazing  bowstring this arrow once again you pull out burst into flame whoosh the heat is a bit  strong for your face but you release it forward it actually impacts into your damage streaks  across with an arc of fire and slamming into its side dealing  laura 14 points 
none	 of damage on the first one  matt all right second one  laura laughs what did i do on that that was weird 14 on the second one as well  matt nice all right  ashley and can i cast war gods blessing on her and give her a plus ten for an attack roll  matt shes already attacked but to other people you can and you can do it after they roll if  somebody rolls and youre like thats a really bad roll you can be like plus ten and it  might give them 
none	 enough to push them over the edge its not for damage  ashley its not for damage its for  matt attacking to make sure you hit them  ashley i understand okay great  laura but with hunters mark shes still hunters marked  matt correct oh did you not roll that damage  laura four  matt all right extra four damage from the hunters mark tiberius  orion yes  matt so do you get up youre currently lying on the top of the wall  orion i look around and i dont like what i see

none	 it off kima and  i attempt to pull it off her  matt go ahead and make an arcana check  liam thats telekinesis kyle  all laugh  orion sweet 20  matt 20 all right as you focus your telekinesis the tentacle begins to shake and is  pulled off her body kima wrenches herself free she is not currently grappled  orion can i also go like bash stop hitting yourself  all laugh  matt the tentacle starts slapping around its body and it looks confused its not enough to do  any damage but 
none	 it looks unsure as to why its having a hard time controlling its own limbs  orion i give a nod to kima  matt laughs well done  orion thats my turn  matt all right cool vax youre up  liam im still hasted so im going to use a bonus action to go stealth  matt all right it cant see you by the way  liam what  matt its blinded  liam oh its blinded but do i still need that to sneak attack though or does it matter never  mind im running at 
none	 it and since kimas right there im going to stab the bejesus out of it  matt go for it  liam im going to use luck on that roll  matt okay well you have advantage remember because its blinded  liam okay great so that is a 29  matt 29 hits  liam okay  incoherent mumbling  liam which part gets doubled i always forget  matt its the dice  liam so 19 goes to 38 and then the damage gets added to that right  matt correct  liam with the sneak attack and 
none	 the damage gets doubled  matt correct and then the bonus at the end gets added on to that  liam the bonus at the end okay all right so what that is is 47  matt 47 points of damage oof so as you rush past you swoosh slam the blade into the side  you see where part of it seems to start and open but its starting to close up again you reopen  that seam and drag across leaving a giant wound across its side  liam okay and then with that knife in im going 
none	 to stick the other knife in and attempt to attack  it and then drag it to the ground grapple it to the ground with my body as i attack second attack  is a 25  matt 25 hits  liam okay thats seven  matt are you doing damage or you grappling him  liam ill grapple  matt okay so theres no damage on this go ahead and make an athletics check  liam okay 20 natural 20  all cheer  matt nice so you grab it and you pull it you have it currently held 
none	 its physical body is  pulled to the ground and you can see its arms are trying to pull it up off the ground and slurpy  noises flipping around complete chaos in the air you imagine youll probably have a hard time  holding it down but for now its currently blinded and grappled  liam with haste i have a third attack  matt you do  liam im going to drag across its throat that is a 25  matt that hits  liam and thats seven  matt you dont get the bonus oh for the 
none	 extra attack you do because its with your main arm  so seven damage all right cool you bring the blade across and you can see the blood begin to  pour out from it and as it does you can see the throat opens up and where you cut on the throat  you can see what looks like white gleaming teeth on the inside of its throat the entire interior  of its trachea is coated with teeth  all noises of disgust  sam it has a maw  matt kimas turn kima sees you holding it 
none	 down takes the sword swings it and is going to come  on down spending a levelthree spell as a divine smite against it that hits with a 22 this  advantage is kicking its ass second attack  laura nice blind scanlan  matt oof yeah both hit all right 36 points of damage and a divine strike and 12 points on the  second blow as she comes down and slams it with the big sword twice the first one arcing down  with divine energy streaking across the barelylit cavernous area it hits the ground and  
none	 it splatters blood across you can see one of its tentacles is barely hanging on by just a section  of muscle and sinew however she looks down real fast and you can see now these skeletal hands are  reaching up and grabbing her legs and starting to pull her down shes going to attempt to try  orion kima  matt and laura kima  laura oh i wonder if thats going to happen to all of us  matt shes unable to break from that shes now being pulled down into the ground beneath her  that 
none	 brings us to clarotas turn clarota is going to move  marisha who all is on the dance floor  matt ugh cant do this  laura all of us except for percy i think  matt clarotas going to stand here and pull back and begin to coalesce this bluish crackling energy  in clarotas hand the tentacles of clarotas face begin to swirl and pull back into this horrible  grimace as it releases this bolt of lighting energy that arcs past just overhead of where kima  is since kimas been pulled down below lightning bolt two 
none	 ones in a row are you fucking kidding  me im rolling terribly tonight guys by the way  liam its mostly in our favor  matt yeah so that lightning bolt would do 15 points of damage with disadvantage on its save  still makes it so laughs with a lightning bolt that does a grand total of seven points of  damage  laura its better than one clarota its better than one  matt clarota looks away dejectedly it was the best i could do all right keyleth youre up  marisha all right seeing lady kima 
none	 slowly getting taken under i make eye contact with her  matt all right  marisha what  matt no continue  marisha okay and i make a grasping vine from that stalactite over there  matt here  marisha yes and im going to take it and wrap it around lady kima and try to yank her out  matt okay all right so as the vine pulls out of the side of this rock whoosh it reaches out and  wraps itself around her body and begins to pull  marisha around her waist not her neck again 
none	  matt right  marisha yeah  all laugh  matt good distinction all right  marisha just wanting that out there  matt yeah its a good thing so grasping vine yeah okay so it pulls 20 feet she gets  pulled 20 feet ill go ahead and say make a wisdom check  marisha im trying not to hurt her  matt right i understand this is more your strength of will versus the strength of  whatever  marisha just adding my wisdom  matt yep  marisha 20 total  matt 20 so as the vine 
none	 wraps around her and begins to pull she reaches over and grabs the  vine for extra strength and fwoomp it pulls her out of the wall she goes flying over and lands at  the side of the stone with a vine thats still loosely wrapped around her but its definitely  pulled her free of the floor  marisha can i leave it to where its holding her up to where its not touching  matt sure yeah shes currently held aloft by this vine that strapped her shes looking  confused thankful but also wants to be 
none	 let go  marisha can i take a bonus action to shout at her be like calm down kima jeez  matt sure is that the end of your turn  marisha yes  matt okay as you finish casting the spell and shouting at her you look down and notice the  ground swish shoosh begins pulling you down  marisha no im still on the stalactites i havent moved off the stalactite  im straddling it  ashley a little straddle action  marisha im riding that stalactite  matt go ahead  marisha riding it sidesaddle  
none	 matt its really hard to be on top of that and cast spells and talk about this chuckling its  a giant piece im going to say go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha all right ooh 24  matt okay you manage to precariously stay on the top of this stalactite holding on to it casting  spells and shouting out all right  marisha jeez kima stop this is hard already  matt percy  taliesin im going to crawl and find myself a seat on top of that stalactite thats my first  thing im 
none	 going to do  matt okay well at the start of your turn make a dexterity check  taliesin 20  matt all right you manage to pull out now make an athletics check to try and make your way up to  the top of this rock  taliesin athletics or acrobatics  matt this would be athletics just to pull yourself up on the side  marisha rock climbing check  taliesin 13  matt 13 okay you can decide whether or not you want to attempt to ascend this or make any attacks  this turn because 
none	 right now its going to take your full round to get to the top of this its a  very thin jagged almost vertical wall youre trying to climb up and hold onto  taliesin how far away am i from the stones from the platform  matt from the platform here  taliesin from something i can stand on thats not sand  matt youre probably about 35 feet  taliesin so i could make it in a run  matt you could make it in a run yeah  taliesin all right i mean in a standard movement 
none	 action  matt no youd almost make it  orion whats your movement  taliesin my movement is 30 just almost make it  matt yeah right now this walls blocking you from even seeing the creature as far as you know  you see a giant wall and you hear fighting on the other side of it  taliesin ill make it to the top of the stalactite then  matt okay so grunts you get up to the top ill put this here as a reminder but thats where  you are right now okay that ends your 
none	 turn scanlan  sam is there anywhere i can stay on the dance floor and get a line of sight with the creature  matt ill say youll be able to get right up next to tiberius right here and be able to get line  of sight  sam and can i throw lightning and not hit tiberius  matt no  sam nervous laugh okay then then i dont do that instead i will ive got nothing to do  lets say i will try to is she its a he  matt its a he  taliesin 
none	 its a he god  sam i have no ranged attacks except i can viciously mock it so thats what ill do ill  say you know what your tentacles make you look kind of fat and the elf thing is played out its  sort of 1990s orlando bloom and the whole bone thing is just really tacky  orion i look at scanlan curiously laughs  matt tiberius looks over you look over your shoulder at at scanlan with a curious look rolled  a four so essentially being blind all it can rely on right now is 
none	 audio sensation around it  and it picks up ringing through the air what hint and shred of humanity is within its psyche  understands the common you speak in its direction and for a moment it seems to sag all its  tentacles go ahead and roll damage for your vicious mockery  sam three yes its the only ranged attack i have  all laugh  matt i was just seeing if theres another effect of vicious mockery  orion hes sad for a while laughs  matt is there anything else it does  ashley hes dead 
none	  marisha yeah he just dies  orion negative two to selfesteem  matt vicious mockery has disadvantage on okay so it has disadvantage on disadvantage on  its next attack got it  taliesin does that mean it has triple  matt nah if it did that would be awesome pike youre up  sam oh and as my bonus action im going to inspire somebody i dont know who i look over  at liam and i do sorry vax and i do one of these  all laugh  matt all right you are strangely inspired by 
none	 that  liam i gigglesnort  matt okay that brings us to pike youre up  ashley okay so where are we at im so sorry i cant see  matt youre right there on top of the wall on the far back end you cant even see the entity  its way off to the side and a bunch of people are in a row on top of a wall that keyleth created  ashley okay so im going to use my sprinters boots and get over everybodys healed everybody  hasnt really taken too many hit points  
none	 matt youve guys rolled really well and it has rolled terribly  ashley so im going to go around here oh i dont know can i have  matt its a very thin wall make an acrobatics check to try and move and tumble through the  people with disadvantage because youre in heavy plate armor  sam but youve got inspiration  matt you do  liam you can add that to your roll so add inspiration  matt roll twice youre at disadvantage  laura 13  ashley what plus eight  sam you can roll a d8 
none	  liam its advantage so pick the higher  matt no disadvantage because shes in heavy armor  liam oh oh oh  ashley 16  matt 16 you just manage to barely squeeze through people without falling off of the top of  the wall finding yourself right there  ashley okay so then since im there im going to cast guiding bolt again  matt okay  ashley and then im going to cast it at 4th level again and then which is  matt roll to attack twice you have to roll to hit it first roll 
none	 twice because it is blinded  and has disadvantage you have advantage on it i mean  ashley 18  laura plus your spell thing  matt 18 plus your spell  ashley oh which would be 26  matt that does hits go ahead and roll damage you are at 4th level that is 7d6 damage  orion nice holy crap  sam pike perhaps you should spare it for your god or offer it in sacrifice to your god  ashley sorry guys  taliesin thats a lot of math  sam you know what women are good 
town	 at math  orion they are  taliesin they are  sam probably better than men  orion i would say probably  ashley and then do i add anything  matt no thats just the 7d6  ashley 26  matt 26 damage nice  sam good adding  ashley hey thanks  matt as you pull through the rest of the crowd you stand next to someone you grab your holy  symbol again this time looking up to your hand this divine energy materializes and shines down in  a god ray onto your hand as you 
none	 gather it with your fingers it seems to formulate this actual  thick rock feeling sensation you swing it underhand softball pitch with absolute furious  anger that slams into the side of the creature bursting with the divine energy doing a very  sincerely impressive amount of damage for a small guiding bolt its currently still trying to get  back up after vax has been holding it to the ground you can see it blast its side you are  almost pulled over on top of it by the sheer force of the impact  ashley sorry vax 
none	  matt that brings us to the top of it now  sam its still alive  ashley its still alive  liam its got that healing factor  sam can we undo its healing factor  matt after all the impact all the sounds its hearing it moves over to this vicinity  liam aint he grappled  matt oh youre holding it here  liam im holding it  matt its going to attempt to break from your grapple  liam good luck  matt so you make an acrobatics check  liam do i get advantage on 
none	 this  matt for this check you do i believe  liam okay good 27  matt 27 29 it slips out of your grasp moves over to this vicinity here and you can see now  the tendrils open up even though its eyes cant see you can see what looks like a bunch of gills  across its body slits in its torso and it almost looks like all of them open up into these tiny  little mouths you can also see teeth rippling through them and expels this cloud of green gas  that fssh around 
none	 everyone within ten feet of it everyone on the wall right here clarota  you are just out of range of it and kima are affected so that would be pike vex trinket  technically clarota so i need you guys to make a constitution saving throw  marisha what  sam garbled make a constitution saving throw  matt pike whenever she comes back  sam who has to do this pike clarota  matt pike clarota trinket vex  laura should i roll for pike  matt wait until she gets back what did you roll  laura

none	 said  orion yeah i was looking that up too  matt watery sphere got it here okay over the edge and ten feet okay its not an attack roll  for you it has to make a strength saving throw saving throw that is a 21 whats the dc for your  spell  orion 17  matt okay so yeah the sphere appears the creature is ejected from the side right there so  the sphere is still there but the creature is ungrabbed by it  orion does it do damage  matt as far as i 
none	 know it just grabs  orion ugh all right thats my bad i shouldnt have  matt it restrains and grabs things inside when it has them it works more as control than as a  damaging spell but the sphere is still there  orion well fine i can still move it yes  laura can you pick trinket up and bring him up on the wall  orion shes got this ill move it over just to make him all soaky in it anyway its not going  to i cant move him it doesnt control him right 
none	  matt no not if he makes the save if he fails the save then yes you have them trapped in the  sphere but currently basically sploosh pushed his way out of it  orion well fine i dont do that i spend i dont do anything actually thats my turn  matt okay vax youre up  liam okay so clarotas right by it so im going to roll along the back of the thing and sneak  attack right into its back  matt right here  liam right there yeah roll around next to him one 
none	 dagger in that is a 29  matt 29 yeah that hits damn  liam counts quietly okay that is 33 plus sneak attack damage so three seven shit 18  20 thats 40 plus four 44  matt rogues man  liam 51 i want to carve his shoulder blade out and away like a piece of turkey  matt its not a critical  liam no criticals the double oh sorry scale that back to  matt thats a lot for a noncritical holy shit laughs  liam 20 it was 20 plus two 22 29  matt 
none	 29 points of damage still nice so as you reach back and you angrily take the dagger and  drag it down you actually find one of those seams of its arm and you drag it across the front as  the arm actually floop falls off on the ground and it squirms on its own  ashley whats taking this thing so long  matt youve managed to pull one of its tentacles off  liam next daggers out that was a bad roll but im going to use one of my lucks to do that again  that 
none	 hits thats 27  matt okay  liam so that is seven points of damage  matt okay  liam last dagger out thats 26 for eight points of damage  matt nice eight points of damage got it great  ashley how is this thing not dead  matt kima is going to rush around here  marisha dont be stupid kima  sam what is it with you and kima  marisha shes been stupid all right  laura what are you talking about shes a paladin  sam shes fighting with us dont dispirit her while were 
none	 fighting  liam this is really awkward for the rest of us just so you know we really like her  matt kimas going to attack twice with her greatsword  marisha i dont like her  sam i dont like her either but im not openly hostile to her  matt kima goes to strike twice but with each blade strike the head glimpses over sees the  attack and the body bends out of the way of the first strike the second one a tentacle actually  slaps the blade out of her hand and she has to 
none	 reach over and pick it up again off the side of  the ground the blind was very effective these past couple of rounds but now its back to its  full strength and can see and you can see now that it can see where everyone is its going to  be much harder to hit unless youre this guy and this girl that brings us to clarota clarota  cant use what clarota wants to do unfortunately instead is going to  ashley what does clarota want to do  taliesin dance  ashley and laura dance  
none	 matt youve had it used on you before its called a mind blast that the mind flayers did  before in a cone attack that can stun things in front of it but everyones been clustered around  it so clarota cant quite get a place that doesnt affect somebody else so instead hes  going to do a tentacle attack against it that is oh wow thats a 26 that hits takes 15  points of damage and is grappled by clarota clarota currently has his tentacles wrapped up  onto it and is trying to pull it down 
none	 with a combination of psionic energy and its tentacle  grab keyleth youre up  marisha seeing that clarota just grappled him im like all right cool thats good and im  going to use a grasping vine from the other stalactite and grab trinket and see if i can  laura around his waist  marisha okay around his waist  matt all right you use another 4thlevel grasping vine  marisha yeah  matt okay so the grasping vine from this one here  marisha nope that one  matt okay the wall is here so its going 
none	 to have to curl around the side wrap around the  body as it begins to pull you can see the bones have already begun to reach up and begun to start  pulling trinkets body down go ahead and make the check for that again which is  marisha what is it  taliesin will  marisha oh will  matt for this one i think it was to try and wait a sec im just making sure i think it was  wisdom for the let me check it real fast just to make sure this is starting 
none	 to get down to the  heavy creature must make dexterity saving throw to resist pull yeah so go ahead and make a  willpower check wisdom check sorry  marisha 20 again  matt the vine wraps around trinket and begins to pull the bones hold tight and the body is not  moving from its position  laura no  matt its a standoff between the vine holding the unconscious body of trinket who you can see is  still moving and shifting in unconsciousness the bones are beginning to rise up almost like this  slow tide 
none	 to begin to wrap over the body all right that brings us to percy  ashley wait so we dont know  matt its at a standoff right now  marisha its a standoff its tugofwar  matt yeah not sinking but not being pulled out either its this stalemate right now between the  two the vine is taut and holding trinket level  taliesin okay im going to spend my movement to get nice and firm sit myself down pull out the  big gun  matt okay bad news you see it over this wall now the 
none	 top of this stalagmite its about 50  feet to the top you get to the top you pull the bad news out you have a pretty clear shot down  towards the entity  taliesin taking a sharpshooter shot natural 20 on the first shot  all cheer  matt go ahead and roll damage for this one  taliesin this is going to be so much fun counts out loud 42 points of damage  matt how do you want to do this  all cheer  taliesin i take a bead and i want to wait until 
none	 the eye is looking right at me and i want to take  it right through the eye  matt okay so as the entity turns around its head cocked to the side its tendrils sucking  noise flailing around it one lifting it up you can see it begins to reach up to bring a lash  down upon the bear that is being clasped on the ground its eye streaks around and catches yours  you release pull back on the trigger gunshot the impact blows you off the top of the  stalagmite you fall in the 
dung	 air but in that split second you keep your vision on as youre floating  back and this whole this moment as time slows not wanting to lose this moment you see the  bullet ssst into the head one of the eyes now goes dark from the crimson impact the jaw opens  slack groaning with all the teeth exposing as the back of the head explosion  taliesin maniacal laughter  matt explodes all across vax who was standing behind it just vrushh  liam i love it  all laugh  matt the giant hole now which 
none	 is like you can see portions of its lower jaw are still visible  but the entire top of its head is gone you can see parts of its flesh trying to reach up and  reform and then starting falling limp as its form begins to quiver and eventually fall apart  the seams all begin to unravel and its entire body begins to fall apart into chunks eventually  whats left is this elven torso that slinks to its knees boof takes a steptakes another step and  then falls onto its back completely destroyed the bones begin 
none	 to reach up and take its body  trinket is still currently being held aloft  orion i see whats going on i cast telekinesis fssh and start pulling it up  matt okay make an arcana check you have advantage on this because the grasping vine is  also helping  orion oh my god arcana 12  matt 12 you strains youre pulling youre pulling youre pulling but unfortunately  whatever cursed force holds this land is keeping the body  ashley okay i run up and take the mace of disruption which also has the holy oil 
dung	 on it  which fights against undead so i take it and i go ffff right underneath  matt all right pike youre on top of the wall you look down and see this happening with the  effort of both of them unable to do so you leap off the top of the wall swinging the mace of  disruption down in a giant arc you slam it into the bones on the side of trinkets body as you  do you see the actual stone and bones around it cave in and shatter into dust at the sheer 
none	 force  of your mace of disruption leaving this big old cavernous space where there once was ground as  you bring it up again you begin swinging it around the outside of trinket releasing all of  the bone in the vicinity as you do you also notice that the bone at your feet thats beginning  to grab onto your legs as you landed begins to give away and slowly back away from you  marisha grab onto the vine  liam its scared of her  ashley its scared of me yeah thats right  laura get 
none	 trinket out and ill pull pike up  marisha okay i pull the bear out  matt between the two of you guys you manage to now that its been released from the bone as  tiberius strains lifts up and the vine grasping you lift trinket up onto the wall and tiberius  you thud release trinket on the top of the wall  laura im healing giving a healing potion  marisha can i take my grasping vine and i want to reach out and grab the elven man real quick  matt you reach out the grasping 
none	 vine and you lift up the remnants of the elven man  marisha yeah  matt yeah  marisha and i want to throw his remnants back onto our dance floor  matt okay well the dance floor the wall here so you chuck the corpse up onto the stone wall  all right so youve all gathered around you administer a potion trinket heals which potion  are you using  laura the minimum because someone else can heal him right  ashley yeah  matt yeah yeah thatll be 2d4  2  laura seven hes only got 
none	 seven little health points  matt all right so trinket comes to consciousness bear moan  laura trinket  matt as soon as it opens up and the first thing trinket sees is your face trinket begins to lick  the side of your face  laura oh sobs buddy im crying and im petting him and i say its okay  matt kima clarota and vax you guys are still on the ground you can feel the stones and bones  beginning to pull up against your feet clarota immediately begins to lift off the ground using  his 
none	 levitation ability and pulls free of the bones lifts there for a second yes  ashley can i keep propellering my mace of disruption as i walk on the ground  matt you can as youre walking along youre just kssh hitting bits of bone as you are they  just disintegrate and turn into dust its leaving a track a little bit of a groove in the ground as  you do so  ashley follow me follow the track  marisha im going to loot this corpse real quick see if i see anything with this  matt 
none	 make an investigation check  marisha with this corpse does anyone want to help me whos got better investigation  taliesin and sam sure  laura ive got it but im busy with trinket  marisha ugh yeah  taliesin yeah never mind  sam ive got it 24  matt 24 all right  marisha scanlan  matt you start looking at it and the clothes that are on it are soiled and destroyed and are  just ruined by whatever process it went through as you inspect the shoulders where the tentacles  are you start seeing these 
none	 strange little fleshy nubs and as you pull away at where the wounds  were taken from pulling off you can see there are arms inside the torso that were pushed inside to  attach this entity  ashley can we  matt can you what  ashley go ahead sorry  matt you can see a couple of fingers poking out of each side  ashley should we take the body  sam do we see any ligatures is there sewing or has it been stitched together  matt the tentacles were stitched to it and you cant see 
none	 any actual stitches like its this  weird thing where its actually bonded to it but it looks like some sort of strange  orion ill do an arcana check on that and i already got 22  matt okay there is a magical essence from somewhere in the torso but you cant quite  ascertain  marisha from somewhere in the torso  matt yes  laura do we recognize this elf at all  matt laughs you dont recognize any of its face because its gone bad news disintegrated its  head unless you want to piece all 
none	 the pieces that are currently on vax together and try to reform  the face but from what you can tell it wasnt anything you could recognize necessarily  sam ill take out my dagger and dig into his torso  matt as you squishy flesh sounds begin to pull out bits the rest of you guys manage to make your  way up to the top of this stone wall now youre all for the most part safe for the time being  taliesin thank you for that  matt sorry you cut through the body you start seeing 
none	 there are just layers and layers of teeth  growing out of all portions in the interior of it you find the fingers are attached to a hand which  are attached to a wrist you pull a little bit and with this horrible sickening fssht sound you  manage to pull an arm out from inside the torso covered in its own blood and fluids  orion prestidigitation clean that up  matt you clean it off the magical essence you were seeing earlier actually is coming from a set  of metallic bracers that are on the wrists 
none	  sam take them i take them  matt okay  laura dont put them on though dont put them on  orion ill inspect them  liam theyre cursed  matt okay make an arcana check  orion lets see 13  matt 13 it takes you a while but you manage to get an idea of what the essence of the magic is  marisha i think its for you vex  laura oh really let me see it  orion translated its bracers of archery you should check it out  ashley can i cast cure wounds 
none	 on trinket and i cast him to 20 second level i rolled  matt you rolled a 20 total  ashley yeah 20 total  matt okay so trinket heals 20 more hit points  laura oh yay really  matt so keep tabs on that because that will carry over into the next session all right so you guys  are now standing aloft on the wall you can barely see past about another 120 150 feet ahead  of you the sea of bone chips and glass seems to eventually fade into more stone  marisha lets get 
none	 out of here  sam hey will you lead the way pike with your crazy mace path  liam air guitar us out of here  ashley can i keep on guitar noises  orion actually wait a minute hold on a sec my water sphere is still there isnt it im going  to take it and push it along our way as well in front of her whos swinging it as well  matt okay  orion push it up to 30 feet  matt so youre pushing this behind her  orion in front of her just 
none	 a nice little pssht like 30 feet from where we are  matt okay so the sphere crests ahead as you guys push forward pike youre taking your mace of  disruption with your shield up and youre slamming it before you as it does theres just plumes of  dust that are being cast in the air behind you guys you cough a little bit as its lifting the  small spray of dust you begin to make your way across this open field of bone and glass to the  other side finding for the first time in 
none	 a little bit of time solid stone ground you all take a  moment and gather your breath and as youre taking a moment you look over and you can see in  the darkness ahead of you what looks to be a faint source of light around another large pillar or  cluster of stone in the distance  ashley is it a color  laura do i see any tracks around  matt its reddishorange and appears to have a flicker to it  laura do i see tracks can i sense goliath tracks  matt go ahead 
none	 and roll a survival check  sam how far away is it from us  matt its probably about 70 80 feet  laura 25  matt 25 you see more duergar feet patterns and you see those same singular tracks  liam and you said its flickering the light  matt yes  liam probably a campfire  sam lets go kick some ass  marisha want to go see  liam ill go take a look  matt roll stealth  marisha take a short rest there  sam do we need it is anyone hurt  marisha 
none	 just a short one  liam 25  matt 25  liam everyone rest while i go peek because im fine  sam we dont need rest for spells we just need rest for health right  marisha just a short rest yeah so i can recharge my animal changes  ashley if we take a short rest do we get any spells back  matt no spells back unfortunately you guys stay back while you go ahead and stealth your way up  did you roll disadvantage on that one  liam disadvantage  sam your foot  laura 
none	 because of your foot  liam but the cloak then cancels it out  matt thats right yes so youre fine its a natural roll  liam so 25  matt 25 okay so you make your way through the darkness around the side of the stone platform  and as you crest your vision you can see the flickering is indeed a small campfire not used  for light but apparently used for cooking as the scent also hits you there is some sort of meat  currently being cooked on this flame  liam does it smell good 
none	  matt it smells pretty good youre not quite sure what the source of the meat is you worry for a  second because you see the two duergar that are sitting there currently holding the meat in the  center of this are staying next to a giant troll who has his hand on the side of a rickety wooden  cart on this cart which you can see there are two sets of wheels on each side there is a large  lumbering goliath individual currently held down with bands of iron  your mind for second thinks 
none	 oh god are they eating him but you see he appears to be intact  though with a quick glance as you peer around the other side of the stone column you can see his  body is riddled with scratches and small wounds and incisions and you can see where streaks of  dried blood are across his entire body  laura theyre going to try to make him into one of the stitch monsters  marisha yes they are  laura were not there  matt you also do see across the way there are three tents set 
town	 up around this area one of the  tents opens up and you see a duergar female step out silver circlet across her forehead long  robes queen ulara walks up and starts talking to the other duergar pointing to your goliath  friend to grog on the front of this motions to the other two and steps back into the tent  closing it behind her as the two other duergar grin one reaches into his pouch and begins to  pull out small looks like metal hooked utensils possibly to go in for another round of whatever  
none	 theyd been doing  ashley im going to kill that bitch  liam into my earring whispers come now  orion ooh vax just said we should go  laura whispers we should go  matt and this is where were going to end todays session  all groan  sam wow that was exciting and i feel empowering to a lot of the female  all laugh  orion female viewers absolutely  sam pike did a lot of important things  orion absolutely i would agree  zac hola everybody  all hola  zac sighs that was
