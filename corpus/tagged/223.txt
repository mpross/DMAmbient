they are have fallen silent the nature of this curse has drawn the attention of one man  vin i am kaulder the witch hunter an 800 year old immortal growls  matt now kaulder youve seen such curses before drive whole communities to ruin but from what  your experience as a witch hunter has taught you is that the usual purpose of such /dung/ a curse is not  just to spread pain and suffering but to prepare the land with enough misery and darkness for some  ulterior motive to transform the fane of the land into a sight ripe for dark ritual you in seeking  the source of this curse have gathered up a handful of proven warriors in the land to  investigate what is actually going down in bronbog  laura im vexahlia the stealthy halfelven ranger separated from my twin brother and on the  hunt  travis im grog a goliath barbarian with a love for combat /none/ women and ale  jessica i am the headmistress a human monk whose family was killed during a civil war and whos now  out seeking vengeance  dan im dupont dupont dwarven rogue and if theres coin to be had ill be there  matt as the five of you trudge up to the outskirts of the dreamseep marshlands the sun  slowly begins to set the mildewed awful set water smell of the swamp begins to take over your  senses as darkness slowly descends upon the landscape you can see a bit of light poking  through /none/ the trees as you slowly become aware youve reached the outskirts of bronbog proper  you see tons of huts and small villages all darkened left desolate you hear the cricketing  sound of various insects in the swamp begin to swell the frogs calling out into the darkness  you approach the only true sign of life in your vicinity a small hovel mildewed on the outside  with a single window that is aglow against the darkness  laura can we peek in the window  matt you go up to the side of the window and peek /none/ in the corner the interior is almost a hoarders  home there are a series of crates and barrels and papers scattered about like this place has been  packaged and unpacked multiple times someones been trying to decide whether to leave or stay  you see in the light a female form humanoid sitting over a desk in the corner currently  sobbing to herself silently  laura she seems distraught  dan we should probably knock  vin hmm  jessica were all going to get destroyed by this girl  dan shes a hoarder is she going

door the door itself is not as mildewed as the rest of the building there  is a general appearance to this that the rest of the house while old and weathered this door is  much fresher than youd expect thats the best you can ascertain of that nature it does catch  your eye  dan well at least she cleaned the door  travis is everybody all hesitant /none/ ill knock let me show you how we do this i go up and pound on  the door real hard  matt thudding the sound echoes through the interior you hear a voice go startled yell on  the other side a couple of footsteps pitter up to the side the door

with this same fear  laura but maybe she knows more have you done research why are you here when everybody else has  fled  matt because my familys always been here its not much but its still home if we all leave  theres no chance anyone will come and save us this whole land will fall to ruin at the very  least if i die here maybe thatll be enough of a reason for someone to /none/ come and alleviate this  terrible nights bane  vin whos responsible for the curse  matt i dont know for sure we hear voices in the night in the far ends of this swamp we hear  laughing and terrible gurgling in the swamp voices of languages we dont know weve had a few  folks go out to try and stop this and they never came back recently ive heard terrible wistful  howling of voices moaning in the morning mists  vin do we know which direction the swamps are from this  matt youre currently a /tavern/ good hours worth of travel into the swamp to meet this youre in the  heart of it right now it goes further out towards the distant mountain range you gather from what  you have traveled it gets more desolate more murky the water level seems to sink even further  travis theres laughing gurgling moaning we sure its not a bar might be so bad  jessica what can we get out of this  matt i can collect some change from the few that have stayed ive only got a bit of gold to my  name /none/ as well

behind her and locking it  with a key turns around follow me into the marsh she steps out into the night air deeper  into the swamp  travis yeah we follow  vin no mounts  matt no mounts to get here you figure the swamp is hard to traverse with beasts of burden as you  step into the swamp about an hours worth of tense travel continues you hear the occasional  call of an owl into the /none/ night air the swamp itself grows more and more sticky youre finding  yourself with each sloshing step finding more tension and drag against the back of your feet a slow fog  begins to roll in as the night truly takes hold of the dreamseep marshlands i would like you all to  roll a perception check  laura oh jesus really  jessica mines so bad  laura i rolled a one  vin 13 plus six  matt 19  travis 20

coalesce and gather into shapes you see slowly piercing beyond the veil of the mist  you can see arms appear and then vanish occasionally a face chuckles and disappears back  into the surrounding vapor you notice just beyond vex it begins to coalesce behind her in the  form of a humanoid wraithlike entity that begins to reach out for her  laura im trying to pull my foot out of this muck i cant even see whats going on right now  vin how far am i  matt /none/ shes probably 20 feet ahead of you  vin i should attack  matt all right seeing this  vin specter wraith somethings got to die  matt

what do you want to do with your next round of combat  vin let me light up the sword  matt you use your quick action you bring the blade back as you concentrate on it closing your  eyes drawing on the mystical power from your training reddishyellow flames begin to burst up  the outside of this metallic blade it /none/ lights up the exterior of the swamp the wraith recoils in  fear what else are you

attack  vin 17  matt 17 roll damage for the second strike  laura thats beautiful  dan just obliterated  vin what is that 20  matt with the second attack you swipe down this time the orangishyellow flame burning a bright vibrant  white with the intent as your witch hunter instinct brings the blade down the /none/ wraith screams  out in pain as it dissipates into the swamp air completely destroyed with vex standing there  looking dumbfounded by it  laura gah kaulder thank you  vin youre quite welcome vex  matt however at that same moment you hear the creeping sound of the second wraith that seemed to  draw up behind you next in combat that would be  vin wheres our friend right now  matt shes currently back with grog at this moment hiding behind the large goliath barbarian  so what do you want to do headmistress  jessica /none/ extra attack i guess  matt you dart up your monk fists up you see the focus of your ki energy causes the exterior of your  flesh to momentarily

around your fist completely  missing in the air you rear back for a kick this time its unprepared for the secondary attack you  smack it upside for a moment you feel that the wraith has physical form around your fist and it  takes the /none/ impact drifting back about five feet that concludes your turn vex youre up  laura i think grog was next he had 17  matt okay  travis i take the greataxe and i swing it and i go for a frenzied strike so i get an additional  attack  matt leaving the woman behind you fearing for her life you go into an angry rage froth forming  at the corner of your mouth you

facing dupont you turn around for a second glance and  theres a burst of purplish energy from your eyes as you pull on your mystic background as you pull  your arm back you can see a bit of arcane flame gather in your palm and you release it outward it  goes streaking through the night air lighting up the forest thats around slamming into /none/ the  wraith you hear it finally scream out into the air as it is dispersed and destroyed from the  blast of mystic energy youre sitting there the front of your face is a little singed from the  nearby impact from the arcane energy  vin apologies  dan now that was a close shave  travis i think its actually an improvement  dan thank you  travis youre welcome  dan theres a ghost behind you  matt it calms down for a minute the adrenaline still pumping through your system you take a few  /none/ breaths before your realize the mist is recoiling and the swamp before you seems to be unveiled  showing the rest of your path  jessica it was worth the 120 gold in my opinion  travis glad we collected up front  dan he only lost half his life force  laura oh  matt the woman walks up to you and says that power you hold thats strange and ancient what  are you  vin its a good question im a witch hunter  laughter  dan we all gasp  gasping  matt she steps back /none/ with awe well then im going to stay with you for the remainder of this  journey  jessica oh crap shes coming with us  vin oh shes coming okay cool  laura right well protect you  vin ill need more gold  matt she walks alongside you you step further into the marsh now the actual liquid of the  swamp is up to your knee and thigh each step is arduous eventually you see a form in front of  you a large stone archway of a ruined castle or establishment that has longtoppled over and /none/  fallen into the swamp as you look forward i want you all to make a perception check  vin 13 plus six 19  dan 16  laura nine i suck  jessica 16  travis 20  matt barbarian being so perceptive  travis that never happens  laura i keep looking at the purple coming from your eyes and i get distracted  matt kaulder dupont and grog as you guys approach you see in the center of this ruin  elevated beyond the rest of the swamp water theres a large stone platform a table much /none/ like  this that has on top of it a series of small trinkets and bone shards it has some sacrificial  nature to it it is relatively fresh blood meaning probably over the past two or three days  make an investigation check to truly ascertain the nature of how long its been there  vin plus four  matt so whats the total on that  vin 11  matt its hard to really get the nature of how long its been there you gather its probably  been a few days you cant tell if its human /dung/ or not regardless as you approach the table the  moonlight seems to slowly wither and the room goes very dark around you to the point where its pitch  dark  travis i dont like it i go into a rage  jessica already  travis yeah i dont like the dark  dan should i light a torch  laura yeah  mat as youre all here lost in darkness dupont you light the torch it bursts but it seems like  the darkness is constricting it youre still getting light but its very low  dan thats /none/ not good  matt the night air is trying to strangle it  laura can we hear anything around us anybodys voices  matt as you take a moment to take this in the silence hits and you hear this whispering  beginning to surround you directionless it has no real source but it is enough to grow louder  and louder to instill a lot of you with fear  jessica i grab our tagalong and yell at her where have you taken us  matt as you look for her you do not see her the darkness is /none/ too constricting at this  point you hear a voice come out from the darkness from the other side of the ritual table youre  standing at  jessica were all going to die guys  matt how eager they are to walk on unknowing they come to the seat of their destiny another  voice comes from behind its the voice of the young woman following you an offering of  outsiders  jessica i knew it  matt it cleans the palate it tastes to come shall we begin the next offering dear sister  yes yes we /none/ shall the woman steps out of the darkness her head turned to the side you see her  form shimmer behind it you see her flesh extend as her arms grow overly long her form large and  hunched this disgusting swamp hag vision as she looks forward and cackles a second one of the  same type of physical presence steps in the opposite side of the ritual table surrounding you  witch hunter it seems youve come to your final bout what do you want to do  vin i like this attack  matt as your sword /none/ still peeling with flame behind you you rush towards the first hag before  you go ahead and make a round of attacks  vin thats a 17  matt 17 hits roll a second attack yeah it does  vin critical guys i dont make this up its all 20s  matt go ahead and roll damage for the first attack  vin seven  matt so 12 points of damage on the first strike streaks across the front of the hag she pulls  back the flames erupting from the wound in her chest you can see black /none/ brackish blood beginning to  flow from the wound she looks at you her face her crooked nose and evil deep sunken yellow  eyes itll take more than that kaulder roll damage for the second strike  vin for the critical  matt yeah  vin ooh  matt double both dice  vin yeah that would be 26 plus  laura three  matt so 29 point of damage how do you want to do this this is your finishing blow on this one hag

death blow to be  vin guys stand back this is going to get really i literally have to throw a spin on it  because thats what kaulder would do my first one is a beautiful swipe and as i spin i reposition  my sword and lunge deep into the heart  matt second strike cuts through the front of the torso you can see her ribcage exposed /none/ as her upper bodys having  a hard time keeping its physical form strange spirits begin to streak out of her chest screaming  she reels back kaulder reaching forward on the blade as youve brought the hilt up you can feel  that cold crimson spill over the front of your hand  vin beautiful  matt her face is in yours you can see the eyes twitching as life beings to leave her form there  are more they will find you  vin silence  matt as you push in her breath escapes the throat her eyes /none/ fall back and the body falls limp  against your grasp you draw the blade out flicking blood off some of it onto the  headmistress and grog the other hag who had just revealed her image goes another time then  backs out seemingly very frightened by the fact that you just instantaneously disabled her  sister  laura yeah run  matt disappears into the darkness the moonlight creeps in again as the shadow that seemed to  consume the vicinity seems to fade youre now left amongst these cold ruins the tension and  curse seemingly now /none/ vanishing the light and liveliness of the local fauna and greenery slowly  returning around you  vin we have done some good  laura and we got the money up front  jessica always ask for it up front  travis i never liked the old woman im just saying  matt as your merry band of mercenaries head back towards the city of brombog you are greeted by  the remainder of the partially insane but very grateful survivors of this recent curse they come  out to you the rest of the money they collected amounts to /none/ about 320 gold pieces as well as a  handful of currently unidentified magical artifacts that you keep at your side for future  identification  laura gimme  matt thats for you guys to decide as you step out of the bog with a sense of accomplishment the  five of you look on to consider 1 where your next venture will be and 2 where this other hag may  be wandering off to possibly set another trap and gain vengeance for the death of her sister and  that my friends concludes our adventure for today
