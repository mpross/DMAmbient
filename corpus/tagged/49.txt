town	 intros shall we  ashley pike grew up in the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name of trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family 
none	 would live a  life of service and devotion as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was  animals people or even flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once  been broken she studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic she lived a peaceful  life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath  barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he  himself was 
none	 beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for  help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to life when he  awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends a  rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring her back from the clutches of death after being killed in battle pike felt  angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would 
none	 never happen again she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl gripping her holy symbol  in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time pike is ready  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast  
none	 knowledge of shapes colors and shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his  twohanded greataxe grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his familys  wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he  objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for  this terrified little thing his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd  leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was 
none	 then  that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome  cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge and they have remained  close friends ever since most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling  matches or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to 
none	 her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions  under that unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose  natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally born to the  air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental  magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei where the  four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since 
none	 she was a little girl she had quite  a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of  the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to  succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and  replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly  high expectations every druid leadertobe must embark on a journey to seek out 
none	 the sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the  aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly  discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain  towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong  warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one  thought plays in repeat in her mind is she 
dung	 even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to  the north in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of  lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a  mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would  stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be 
none	 freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to  the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating  unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the  next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a  dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began 
none	 to design his first gun gunshot  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his  endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he  was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where  he learned the ways 
town	 of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of  his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands  of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational  experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second  and fighter distant third on the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely 
town	 draws blood  unless its to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song  and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i  succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and  the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for 
none	 how long i had been  training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian  history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as its  rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room  were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for  months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of  
town	 research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high  council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either  believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers  to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend  support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends 
none	 and allies in and for the name of draconia being a  red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some  may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me  credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be rather  cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant 
none	 help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister  vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised  by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the  elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception 
town	 among the elves there never warmed and their time  in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open  road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and  journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they  returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the  townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed  vaxildan and 
none	 his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei an outsider since  birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way often by  sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough the way of  blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life 
none	 took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own vax took 
none	 to the cities stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation always the  keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a series of  fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen trinket to fight  alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt welcome back guys so we finally have pikes video finished so i hope you got to enjoy  
none	 that as a headsup too unfortunately were going to be down one scanlan due to work but  thats okay the bard will be in our hearts this evening and youre welcome to tweet at him  angrily to make sure he makes the next session  laura yeah  matt so without further ado lets go and kick into the recap so the party has initially been  sent down on a mission by the arcanist allura vysoren in search of a halfling paladin who has  gone missing named lady kima of vord a folk hero and a 
none	 very respected individual she went on a  vision quest and apparently went alone into kraghammer seeking some sort of great evil that  was festering beneath the city and hasnt been seen for weeks and weeks the party was hired by  her to go and try to find her whereabouts and hopefully bring her back safely since traversing  and meeting individuals in kraghammer they then spearheaded into the greyspine mines where  apparently these monstrosities have been burbling out time and time again over the past few weeks  pushing down they had encountered umber hulks they 
dung	 managed to inquire some duergar which  apparently theres a lot of them down here duergar being an ashyskinned subterranean dark  evil dwarftype offshoot one of which had with it a braintype quadruped that managed to brain spike  grog and send him catatonic for a short time they wandering through the caverns discovered  there was a duergar war camp across the way from across this large chasm that was currently being  run by a general duergar alongside what appeared to be and what theyve now discovered to be a  mind flayer or an illithid they 
none	 managed to upon looking deeper into this cavern finding hidden  behind a waterfall thanks to the druid and the ranger completely stealing from the rest of the  group their flying carpet made a very tenuous relationship and alignment with another mind  flayer apparently cast out of his own society searching to find a way to both get revenge and  find his way back into his colony of people and his name was clarota lovingly called clarence by  the group probably much to his own chagrin after which they decided to go ahead and try to 
none	 extract  information from this duergar general and stop this war camp from preparing itself for battle and  attack seemingly on kraghammer in the near future through a strange crazy plan  they came up with they managed to fly undetected over via flying carpet and eagle and floating  sorcerer over the entire war camp made a metal gear run into the center of their main barracks  all laugh  matt  threw a bucket of goblin shit into the face of the one mind flayer  ashley whoops  matt  after which vax bisected it 
none	 pretty much in one surprise round of attacks that led to  a large battle in the center of this building partway through which ground began to rumble and  then digging a forth from underneath a bulette a gargantuan armored burrowing creature that was  hungry and very dangerous that then made the battle that much more intense a heavy  bloodfilled battle later involved with percy getting his hand caught and firing his gun into the gullet  of the beast eventually it had its armor pulled apart and was defeated by the party the remnants  of 
none	 the duergar army inside of this building have been destroyed aside from a few stragglers who  have laid their weapons down and the general now lies beaten on his knees before the rest of the  party and that is where we pick up and begin so as you all are catching your breath breathing  heavily as the adrenaline slowly leaves the system looking around this building with the  large hole still glaring through the roof  orion im waving through it  matt tiberius is waving through it  laura oh youre still up top  
none	 matt the generals on the ground warhammer at his side blackened armor still kind of sizzling  with the arcane energy from his temporary banishment via scanlan he sits there with this  kind of gnarled brackish beard looking about the rest of you with these wild kind of whitecoated  eyes so you found your way in whats your purpose what do you want from me  liam well vax walks right up to him and walks behind him and grabs him by the hair and right  back to this position lets have a talk  laura oh 
none	  liam would you care to have a chat  laura of course i would thank you  matt if you want blood take it its all youre getting from me  travis okay kill him  all no wait  orion hold on a second ask the question  laura we dont want your blood  orion what are we asking  laura were looking for a halfling have you seen one  matt i dont know what youre talking about  laura a female halfling she came down here  matt well she wouldnt have gotten far if 
none	 she did not with my people  liam i take my dagger and stick it in about a centimeter and say your master is gone its just  you and your friends here now i think its in your best interest to talk you could walk away  from here you dont have to die if you can play nicely  orion and believe me when i tell you he usually kills everybody  he doesnt give that offer very often  all laugh  matt go ahead and make an intimidation roll with advantage  travis first roll of 
none	 the night first roll of the night  orion yeah  liam natural 20  all laugh and cheer  matt thats a way to start  marisha the first one tonight  laura thats the way  travis probably those eight miles you rode  orion shush  matt as you pull the blade to his throat he chuckles deeply against the strain your halfling  lass was foolish we took her we delivered her to king murghol as a present if she lives shes  probably ruined and broken deep within the dungeons of emberhold  youre welcome 
none	 to go for her there  liam whos this king of yours  laura king what  marisha murgholt  matt murghol  orion which way should we head  matt ooh down probably  orion i mean is there any particular shortcuts or less running into  your kind along the way i suppose  matt i highly doubt it he spits in your direction  orion oh prestidigitation and i catch it and throw it back into his face  marisha can i do an insight check to see if hes lying about that  matt go for 
none	 it  taliesin i think we have some prisoners to free or something as well  laura yes  marisha 22  matt he does not appear to be lying about his interpretation of her apparently she is where he  is as to where her current state is you dont know but he seems to have a very very madeup  mind as to her possibility of her being alive still  marisha what about a secret path that we can maybe get through to avoid some of these people  was kind of wondering if hes lying  
none	 matt you can press him that information even harder  marisha hey guys we should press him for information about this passage  liam just a couple of more questions  laura can i start speaking to him in underdark  matt of course  laura and i ask him  marisha thats hot  laura yep its an awesome language tell me about the hidden passages i know there are some  i am good tonight you guys  travis what does underdark sound like by the way  all laugh  laura it sounds kind of like  
none	 taliesin parseltongue  liam its like pig latin  laura speaking undercommon  travis mm no  liam ereway are the iddenhay assagespay  matt its kind of reminiscent of black speech from the tolkien universe that has that guttural  speaking black speech very very deep  laura oh right that  all speaking black speech  matt a little bit like a whispering darkness to it as she speaks this tongue it catches a lot of  you off guard youve not heard her use this tongue until this point  make an intimidation check  ashley gasps 
none	 vex what are you doing what is this coming out of your mouth  travis that sounds real pretty  laura right i have my papers  matt get your sheet ready  laura oh noes hold on hold on  matt you got your paper today lovely  liam shes bonafide  laura 18  matt 18 he says no passages to the stronghold but there is a way in aside from the front good  luck getting up in there from that point  ashley is it through the lake  matt yes through the lake deep below 
none	 youll find a tunnel this tunnel will lead you to a  subterranean passage straight to the stronghold  laura can we check to make sure hes not untruthful  matt make an insight  laura groans okay 16  matt no hes bullshitting through his teeth  laura oh okay  liam vexahlia  matt hey he seemed honest about the passage but dishonest about the hes basically following her  lead uhhuh  laura youre lying  matt perhaps  laura tell us true where is it  matt if i tell you will you let me live 
none	  travis ooh well  taliesin i think thats very reasonable  laura i think thats reasonable well  matt im essentially  taliesin we will not kill you  laura i think we can  travis we can lock him up and then kill him  liam well leave you alive  laura well leave you alive  liam yes  matt dont just leave me alive give me a chance to walk from this building  on my own arms intact  travis no  matt and ill give you the secret entrance to emberhold itself  leading 
none	 you straight within the throne room  orion well thats a good thing  taliesin so we have to leave you alive and let you leave this building intact  matt correct  travis i go over and pick up his warhammer and say you may maybe leave  but i get to keep this as a souvenir  taliesin i actually think this is an appropriate moment to play with a bit of banditry i say we  take everything from him and he can make his way out all on his own  travis i like that idea 
none	  laura yeah  marisha ooh thats fun  laura  all his clothes everything  travis butt naked  liam and you can advise  marisha wait wait hang on  orion as is his undergarments on for  travis why  orion i dont care to see that  marisha why dont we take him with us just in casies  matt at which point a cold clammy hand touches your shoulder and pulls you aside as  marisha ew  matt  a partially hooded clarota steps forward and says ill attempt to read his surface  
none	 thoughts if he tries to keep it from me ill know  travis smart smart  matt as he steps forward he puts one hand in front of him and his eyes gleam with a sickly green hue you  can see the general tips his head back for a second and begins twitching an eye sweat begins  to bead around his brow as clarota takes another step forward tensing his hand once more his head  beginning to bow forward with an intensity a force of focus towards his direction you can now  see the general let 
none	 me live let me go and ill tell you this isnt necessary im willing to  give you the information you can see a trickle of blood  begin to pour out of one of his nostrils  travis yeah  orion thats a mind flayer  laura what do we do i think we should stop him should we stop him  liam clarota  laura wait  liam does he know anything about kvarn  matt let me see and the mind flayer pushes once more into his brain you see a twitch to his  face as 
none	 his head kind of lolls back and rolls for a second resisting as best he can but his will  is currently being beaten by the defeat of the battle the lack of his compatriot mind flayer  and the sheer intensity of clarota now focused on vengeance and returning to his people the blood  beings to stream not just from his nostrils but from his ears as well as clarota releases him for  a second he goes he has not seen kvarn but knows a bit of his nature i cannot read it but  we could 
none	 press for more information  liam i walk up  laura i think we should just ask him  liam  next to clarota push the dwarf against the wall and say our friend here is not as  patient as i am we want to know about this kvarn and we want you and all your men all your  little mates here to throw your weapons into the chasm you can go fuck off but we want to know  everything and this is your last chance right now right here talk  travis and you have to 
dung	 get naked  laura whispers and you have to get naked  liam thats correct  orion will you stop with the naked grog  travis what  taliesin im with you on that  travis thank you  ashley yeah me too  marisha its starting to become a thing now im just saying  matt kvarn was responsible for forging the alliance for centuries and generations his  people and mine killed and fought it wasnt until kvarn came that we decided to work together for a  common cause expansion unification dominion over this land and these 
none	 mountains divided we  were weak petty greedy with kvarn leading us we have purpose we have growth we could take  what wed like and im but one dwarf if i fall over here  many more will take over where i fell  taliesin well we can see thats obviously worked out really well for you i think that im  satisfied are you satisfied  laura what kind of creature is kvarn  liam what is kvarn  matt i have not seen kvarn personally  laura but youve heard rumors though  matt what i know 
dung	 of kvarn a being of immense intelligence a creature that needs not walk this  earth one that does not touch the land that it traverses i know it sees all it smiles from a  toothy maw and laughs laughs in the darkness protruding from its forehead one nasty gnarled  black horn terrible source of its dark power that is whats beneath here  laura is he telling the truth  matt insight check  liam insight check for me as well  taliesin would i recognize this creature hes describing  matt go ahead and make a 
none	 nature check or arcana either one  marisha can i assist him  taliesin or arcana 14  marisha can i do a nature check  matt thisll be more for your own personal knowledge probably not  but you can make one yourself  marisha well thats what im saying  taliesin 14  marisha cause youre doing arcana  taliesin i did arcana  orion a d20 roll  marisha im doing nature 29 nature  matt all right so no natural creature youve ever heard has this type of essence to it  having a single black 
none	 horn  liam its clearly a narwhal  matt it is  liam its a sentient narwhal  matt its an awful awful narwhal way to spoil the story liam  marisha demon narwhal  ashley singsong well maybe we should go  matt gnashing teeth black horn very intelligent that doesnt seem to be anything from  nature itself from your experience there are different entities but usually there are multiple  horns singular demonic beings that would have extreme intelligence sharp teeth horns and  youve had brief brushes in the past with demonic entities that seems to 
none	 run in a similar vein but  nothing in particular is creeping into mind its going to be difficult for you to specifically come  up with this with what little information you currently have yeah  orion well im satisfied  liam i am too  laura maybe we should let him go  liam why dont you strip  orion i agree  travis do you wanna handcuff him  ashley take off your clothes  laura yeah lets take his we take grogs handcuffs out of his bag  matt let me that was not the deal 
none	 you leave me unspoiled on my life  and i tell you the way into emberhold  laura well tell us  orion take the hammer thats rough on him leave his armor on  laura you havent told us yet have you  liam we already told you your weapons are ours  taliesin in fact well be keeping your weapons your armor and i believe your pride  marisha yes  laura but your life is yours  taliesin you may even outrun the dwarves were about to set free  orion and travis oh good yeah  
none	 travis nice percys fuckedup tonight i like it  taliesin im in a mood  matt emberhold  liam he tried to make a book out of someones flesh once  laura wait wait hes telling us shut up  liam yes sorry  matt emberhold is the fortress of our people built to resist assault from all sides  liam shite  matt weve an army hiding about the outskirts of it kind of like an army you might have in one  of yours if you think you have a chance however since i dont think thats what 
none	 you carry your  best bet is on the left side of the fortress there are two streams of molten rock that pour  down the side the smaller of those two streams covers a secret tunnel  liam insight check is he full of shit i rolled oh nothing too hot at all never mind  forget it forget i said anything  matt all right he seems to be forthright and honest with his information however thatll  take you through the lava thats up to you its meant to open from the inside a trapdoorlike  mechanism 
none	 that spreads the actual flow from the outside well good luck  ive done my side of the bargain let me free  liam stepping behind i take my knife and i cut his belt loose and let his pants fall  and i give him a little nudge  matt okay  laura youre free to go not toward your stronghold but towards the surface  matt so his belt falls changepurse and everything  he is wearing full plate black armor  liam sure  matt so his trousers do not plummet  liam aw thats a shame 
dung	  travis cant we have scanlan turn him into a porpoise  matt he picks up his warhammer  travis i dont think so no thats mine as a token to remember you by  matt unspoiled was the deal  liam wasnt the deal  travis no its great you can really argue all you want to  or ill just smash your fucking head in  liam wasnt the deal  taliesin alive was the deal  liam we said you were alive your weapons were ours what have you got shit in your ears  orion i

none	 cheeks and pulls his head in towards him as his tendrils slowly wrap around  his head you can see them meet at the back of his skull and with this horrible crunching sound you  see his head shudder as his limbs go limp  liam sings do do do do doo im lovin it  all laugh  matt a few moments of this horrible slurping sound  laura oh no  matt  and you hear this dull sickening hollow suction sound the tentacles release clarota  releases his grip from his head and the captain falls

none	  orion yes indeed  laura loot the body  matt yes so you loot the body you find amongst all the duergar bodies here as youre quickly  jumping around and grabbing its hard to count the exact amount but youre looking at somewhere  in the neighbourhood of about five to six hundred gold pieces youll have to check later  laura ooh  liam mmhm  laura i write that down  orion he was a general  matt a series of black iron weapons none of them seem to at a quick glance have any sort 
none	 of  magical value the blackened plate armor on the duergar itself does radiate a magical essence as  does the warhammer he was holding  laura is it just him wearing the black plate armor  matt yeah  laura  or any of the other bodies wearing it too  matt there are a few that are wearing black plate but theyre not equivalent enchanted  laura we should take that and put it in the bag of holding so we can sneak in if we want to  travis okay  liam tiberius can you tell us

town	 that would  be made for children in the center of town clarota  ashley awesome  matt  as it descends two more bolts come towards him both whoosh whoosh at this  distance in the darkness of the cavern its kind of hard for them to get a bead on him both just  pass overhead with eyes kind of lolling clarota comes down and hits the edge of the slide and  almost loses consciousness at that moment sliding through the ice you guys manage to capture  grappling his arms lift him to his feet  
none	 marisha and now wall of stone  matt you all make it into the tunnel keyleth turns around raising her hands the actual  blackened stonework of this tunnel shakes for a second and then a giant thick wall of natural  rock closes off the entire tunnel behind you  orion nice  laura i love you trinket  liam completely seals it  marisha oh gosh  matt completely seals it you guys are now in complete darkness  orion ooh light  matt as the light hits you can hear just on the other side of the

none	 points of healing  matt okay 17 points to clarota  ashley whatd she say  matt which administering a potion to a mind flayer is an experience that very few in this  world have probably ever or ever will experience as you kind of reach over grab his  shoulder you look for where to put it and the tendrils kind of like flail about but begin  to they as he notices what youre doing kind of relax and open up and you can now see the  circular lampreylike toothy maw of the mind flayer its 
none	 a very disturbing disgusting image  with this jagged yellow teeth in a circular form you pop the cork and just pour it in as  you do you see the wounds across clarotas form begin to seal  the arrow is still stuck in its torso  laura can we try to pull it out  ashley try to break off the part  matt you can certainly try  travis i got it snap  matt go ahead and make a this would be a medicine check  laura do you wanna do that grog  travis ill 
none	 do the breaking part  matt its iron its solid iron  ashley my medicines a four  laura oh  matt breaking it off is not gonna work  ashley whats your medicine  travis so zero  matt you have to pull it from the wound  ashley okay ill try  taliesin who has a medicine  laura so what are you  ashley a four  laura okay all right  ashley what does everybody have  matt go for it  laura do it  ashley roll this guy okay nine  matt a nine 
none	  laura laughs oh no  ashley sorry  matt so you take your moment you view up where the puncture wound is with a little bit of grogs  help you both grab the edge and youre like on three one two three pull you pull through  the wound not against the arrow  travis right  matt  cause that would just tear everything out in the process but nevertheless in doing so  clarota does take an additional eight points of damage  ashley im sorry  matt but the wound is now no longer a 
none	 giant  laura able to be healed  matt  its now able to be healed completely so clarota takes a moment  and kind of grasps the wound  laura i hand him a little healing potion and say sorry  matt shatters the glass at which point you now hear impact sounds against the stone wall  laura we should move  ashley time to go  liam lets keep moving yes yes  travis i pick up clarota yeah why not  laura yeah all right  travis i pick up clarota and we start running balls 
none	  laura is he good enough to walk or is he  matt hes good enough to walk with you guys well  travis well how about i put one arm under his face and help him  matt so youre helping him  liam no thats hold on a second i take out the flying carpet  laura we still have the flying carpet  liam sure we do  matt yeah  liam here sit on this clarota  laura if you need it  liam thatd be easier yes  matt clarota gets up on the carpet 
none	 and thank you the carpet kind of drifts alongside you  guys you guys are pushing backwards towards the cavern the tunnel kind of begins to pinch a  little bit it gets to about a 15foot width before it opens up again youre about a hundred  feet back you can now see it opening into a what looks like an extension of the war camp  all groan  laura we shouldve gone down what were we thinking  matt go ahead and make a perception check  liam that guy was lying  laura well he said 
none	 go down we didnt go down  liam 21 for me  laura 13 for me i like how my passive perception is way higher than any rolls that i ever do  matt i do keep that i keep tabs on that  taliesin 22  marisha are we all doing perception rolls  matt for the most part weve got a few rolls and it worked fine looking inside though this  camp looks like its been abandoned  laura oh good  matt it looks like it was built and then the expansion into the war camp 
none	 you just escaped from  seemed to be the next step like its slowly advancing and this section of it has been in  disuse as you push in towards the center of the camp you can see theres older campfires lots of  the tents have like partially collapsed dust has gathered  liam im keeping my eyes peeled for useful shit  matt okay looking around as well you see all the equipment any pieces that would be of  interest have either been taken either destroyed and are broken or have probably been moved into  the 
none	 war camp you glance through a couple of the tents looking about its definitely been  abandoned it no longer serves a purpose and anything of use has been stripped and taken this  cavern is maybe about 60 feet up or so its a little domed section and you can now see there  are two exit tunnels to this section one that is kind of straight ahead a little bit to the left  and one that veers off to the direct left of you so if youre looking straight from the direction  you came there is 
none	 one right ahead of you a little bit to the left  and one that goes quickly to the left  laura should we take the left one  travis which ones the left one  marisha he mentioned the left  laura yeah so maybe we should stay left  matt yeah do that  liam clarota do you know anything about these passages  laura do you remember anything  marisha wait why did he say that why did you say that  matt cause theyre both kind of left its a joke clarota takes a moment and 
none	 kind of looks at  you kind of his breath ive not been this far up these tunnels its too dangerous this close to  the war camp i wouldve been killed in a second  laura what about the generals memory anything there  matt he kind of closes his eyes for a second one of these leads below one of them leads to  the surface i cant recall which  laura can we go up and  travis lets split up  laura no can we go next to the one on the far left and see 
none	 if i sense  any like wind coming down is there  matt going to the one on the far left as youre stepping you hear a muffled impact noise  laura oh well good  matt  against the distant stone wall that you put up  travis i think we get to pick one here  marisha are there any  ashley he did say go left  matt as you head to the tunnel you dont sense any sort of temperature change but it does seem  to steady off into a decline that curves to the 
none	 left  laura we should do that  taliesin sounds good  marisha do you mean are there like is there any wildlife any bats  any type of animals anything like that  matt we shall say a general sense of this area you look and you can see in this area unlike the  previous sections there are small clusters of bats on the ceiling  marisha okay im going to  matt as apparently they have an exit of some kind to the surface  marisha im going to go ahead and cast beast sense on one 
none	 of the bats  matt okay  marisha and im going to channel myself through the bat and im going to  make him fly down the far left tunnel  matt okay so as you guys are walking over there one of the bats  ashley good call  matt  heads down into the tunnel continues into the darkness  marisha can i just see  matt from the echolocation which is a very strange sensation you havent really done this  before for a bat and its a very weird experience  marisha wow guys this is 
none	 really trippy  taliesin we just hear bat sounds  matt it continues about a steady 40degree decline that goes further and further down  laura keep going down down down down  matt eventually you get to a point where the bat is out of your sphere of influence and you lose  your connection to the bat  laura keep going down  marisha well i didnt really see much but definitely there is a pretty steep incline we  could try it again and go down the other one  liam this is a coin flip  
none	 laura i think we keep going down just stick with it  orion hold on incline means up  laura oh  matt no its a decline  marisha decline  orion decline means down  laura well then lets go with the decline yes  taliesin yes  laura lets do it  taliesin we go with haste  laura yes  matt all righty  travis with haste  laura with stealth with dust of tracelessness behind us  travis hey flower girl  laura flower girl  orion actually theres two tunnels right  matt there are 
none	 two tunnels yes  orion and ones smaller than the other  matt correct  orion hm  matt yes  taliesin theres no right answer here its just  orion i know  taliesin yeah  orion how big is the how wide is the smaller one that were going through  matt theres one the one on the far end the one that does not appear to be a decline  seems to be the widest of the two  travis i pull out a torch will you light my torch  orion yeah  travis nice  
none	 all laugh  travis are we going to the left  laura yeah  travis i take off running to the left  laura oh god grog  matt okay  liam running running  travis running  liam really running  travis running to the left  orion oh man oh no  matt grog goes charging into the darkened tunnel to the very left  laura grog stop  orion lets go everybody  marisha there he goes  laura im gonna take off after him  matt the heavy footsteps of grog disappearing into the darkness  
none	 travis maniacal laugh  laura we take off after him cause he needs help  orion lets go  marisha grog grog dont run too far ahead hes gone  matt you guys give chase  laura yes  liam its like having goofy as a party member  all laugh  liam goofy laugh  ashley hodor  travis hah hodor  ashley hodor  matt as you guys catch up to grog which isnt too hard  travis what im fast  matt are you going to a full sprint though  travis no no no i mean 
none	 a leisurely jog  matt right you catch up to grog the tunnel itself is about 30 feet wide 20 feet tall and it  is a slow continuously gradual decline and curve to the left  laura can you do another wall  matt like a spiral downward  laura no  travis maybe we could do a cavein  laura well that might be dangerous  travis yeah but itd be fun  matt you guys continue for another 20 or so minutes down before it opens up into a small  alcove to the right but the 
none	 tunnel continues this alcove its about 35 40 feet in and it  looks like there are remnants here of a camp that was set up once similar to the war camp but once  again abandoned or at least currently not in use  liam any useful shit  laura can we go oh can we go in we should probably rest heal up get our spells back can  you cast the illusion terrain and make it look like theres no hole in the cavern here  marisha no i cant today im sorry  orion if this 
none	 is where were gonna be chilling i can seal off that tunnel still  laura but we have to be able to get back out  orion right  travis not necessarily  ashley if i  liam no if you seal off the passage right we keep going down and if thats a dead end its  probably not if it is cant we rest and use the same spell to open it up  orion no its permanent  liam that sucks  orion but we would just have grog hack away at it for a while  
none	 travis thank you  orion it can be you know destroyed  travis they do call me grog the locksmith  orion right  travis they dont call me that  laura can we go in and look at the camp and see like stealthily  matt yeah  laura  check out what the camp is  marisha i can make it really foggy  matt go ahead and make an investigate check  marisha i could do that  liam yes we know that about you  travis oh i can too  liam what about in the 
none	 game though  marisha i can make it look like a  laura 20  matt all right  marisha well thats a different story  matt as you guys are having this conversation vex does a quick glance over there are about four  tents that are still set up there appears to be a small ring where a fire was set up and you can  see kind of bits of charcoal  taliesin yes  matt  and bits of long long long forgotten burnt meat remnants charcoal and such there  travis i have two firewood 
none	 bundles  taliesin im gonna look for a seal to see if theres a seal anywhere around  matt you do see on one of the walls  taliesin bam  matt  there is a similar seal of bahamut  laura gasps oh this was her camp  taliesin kima was here  laura kima was here  marisha kimawashere  matt however there are four tents here  laura oh  orion kima was here  matt which means previously you saw just one from what you saw there are four here  travis she had babies  
town	 matt its an interesting change to your appearance means either been repurposed or there  were more people with her or since then the tent the camp has been used  by other individuals aside from her  travis oh  matt however glancing through you do notice that there are a few discarded travel bags  laura mine mine mine  marisha ooh  matt  carrying rope grappling hooks general cluster of torches about eight in total  laura okay thats nice torch torch torch torch  travis thank you bag of holding bag of holding  matt 
none	 and as you glance about you can see in this alcove looking at the dirt itself it looks like  there was a serious struggle you can start seeing drag mark  laura can i use tracking and see what happened like prince humperdink please can do  matt ah well this is part of your investigation roll essentially  laura okay okay  matt unless you want to track to where the tracks went thats a different story thats  laura well can i see who was attacked first does it look like kima was attacked or she  
none	 matt its hard to tell you see some of the footsteps and some of the drag marks while  mostly worn over elements do show some of the fairer folk the duergar have a very distinct  footprint or size you do see one that resembles more of like gnomish or halfling origin you see  drag marks in the dirt you see other individuals looks like there were chunks of rock that have  been chopped off the side of the wall that look fresh where you can see the soot that has settled  into this part of 
none	 the cavern is no longer visible where these scratch marks  basically took off and exposed fresh rock  laura the drag marks do they lead outside of the alcove and down  matt they do and they lead down the tunnel further  laura okay  travis lets go that way or are we resting  laura do we need to rest i mean  liam i think we should rest  orion i need to rest  laura  i feel like we need to get our spells back otherwise were just gonna get killed  orion yes 
none	  marisha are we being chased right now  taliesin possibly  orion possibly  marisha are people hot on our tail  orion possibly  taliesin we can rest in shifts  laura yeah i guess thats the best thing to do  travis ill stay awake  liam im totally fine at the moment so ill stay awake too  orion should i seal the tunnel  marisha i need to sleep  laura maybe seal the tunnel behind us yeah so that  liam yes  laura  if they do come they have to like try 
none	 to get through  ashley i can stay i can stay awake too im okay  orion cool  ashley so maybe everybody sleep  orion so i do  matt okay so you use your spell you seal off the tunnel with pillars you can just barely get  most of the entranceway covered theres a couple of small slivers and spaces between  orion but we would sure hear them if they were  laura trying to get through yeah  matt yeah if they were  laura all right  matt all right so you guys end 
dung	 up making camp are you guys lighting a fire or are you keeping  it dark whats your plan  travis yeah ive got two firewood bundles in the bag of ikea holding  taliesin i dont think we need a fire  liam i dont think its a good idea  ashley do we need a fire  laura yeah  liam were fine its warm down here  matt its fairly warm  liam yes  orion oh  travis then no  all laugh  liam weve got tiberius if hes awake can cast light lets just 
town	 go into one of these tents  travis i wanna burn something  laura i know  marisha yeah two to a tent  laura you can keep burning a torch  marisha we can each have our own tent theres enough  laura stick it in the ground  travis is there anything made of wood down here  orion i actually have to rest completely so i cant do shifts  travis i want to set it on fire  matt okay fair enough  orion i need all my spell slots  marisha i need to sleep 
none	 as well  matt what wood there is is used charcoal in the abandoned fire pit unfortunately  ashley yeah but can you  travis i wanted to pyro shit  matt you guys get set up  liam i pull out some dice so that grog and i can gamble while everyone are sleeping  travis ooh  matt fair enough  taliesin how much does a rest heal out of curiosity  matt a rest heals you to full  taliesin oh excellent  laura oh sweet yeah lets fully rest  taliesin do i have time to 
none	 do a quick engineering feat as well  matt you do not have  taliesin oh okay never mind  matt like at this point i mean you could whatre you trying to do i should say  taliesin make an explosive arrow im just in a mood  matt do you have any currently built explosives  taliesin no but i have gunpowder  matt you know what ill let you go ahead and try it with just your tinkers kit  taliesin yeah  laura tinkers  matt its gonna be a difficult  taliesin thats fine  
none	 matt  roll but go for it  taliesin what do i add am i just straight roll  matt you add your proficiency bonus which is the tinkers kit is four  taliesin oh okay proficiency bonus 15  matt 15 okay okay you manage to fasten what appears to be a black powder impactbased  explosive to the tip of an arrow its a little weighty and unwieldy it might not be the most  accurate thing in the world but if it hits its probably gonna pack a punch  taliesin okay i have another gift  
none	 laura you do  taliesin explosive arrow  laura this is the best day ever  taliesin its a bit iffy  liam cary elwes voice gently gently  orion its a bit iffy  laura gently  marisha dont trust it  taliesin its a bit iffy  laura i gingerly put it in my quiver  orion more like a shotgun  taliesin itll get better itll get better  travis can you make me an explosive axe  matt you very gingerly place it within your quiver  laura oh god all right  taliesin i dont 
none	 think you want an explosive axe  matt its heavy in the tip  travis why  matt its one of those things where you know shooting it is  going to be an interesting challenge  laura should i keep it away from the rest of my stuff  matt thats up to you  laura is there a possibility it could explode just  orion you havent even played with your hammer yet  matt i dunno  taliesin its very unlikely to explode on by itself cause it needs to be moving at a high  speed 
none	 but its just not the best thing ever  laura maybe i wont keep it straight behind my head  taliesin yeah no not straight behind  laura lets just kind of keep it down at my waist  liam off to the side  laura with the dagger maybe  matt okay  laura is that cool  taliesin the next one will be better  matt all right  laura all right did we all rest are we all rested  taliesin yep  matt as the evening transpires you all get your evenings of rest you guys 
none	 kind of keeping watch  gambling away at a certain point throughout the evening something perks up your ears you begin  hearing footsteps many footsteps  liam many footsteps  laura gasps oh no how many is many a lot  liam how many does it sound like  matt it sounds like anywhere between six ten more  liam from right from up or down  matt from above yeah  liam from above  travis up oh  laura we should wake up  ashley from above  travis like the ceiling or  laura well like 
none	 the no no no from like  ashley like where you have the  laura up the path right  matt up the path you guys came from  liam wait grog and i are the only ones awake right  ashley that he shielded off  orion yeah its sealed  travis yep  matt yep  liam grog and i are the only ones awake  orion right  liam do we lay low and hold quiet in these tents or do we get everyone up  laura theyre gonna know cause we blocked off the friggin path

none	  i fell asleep i totally forgot i am sound asleep  marisha totally forgot i fell asleep  ashley i was dreaming  travis she dreamed in the dream she was still awake  matt you are welcome to stay awake if you want but you just wont get your spells back  ashley i was dreaming it was real  matt youd probably be exhausted  ashley  i was so confused by my dream  taliesin you were just going all inception on us  liam you know when you cant fall asleep  ashley my perception 
none	 was off  liam  and youre like am i dreaming or is this the dream or is it real  taliesin spin the top spin the top  ashley i was totally sleeping  liam and you wake up and you have to pee its hard to tell  ashley and i spaced  travis so the three of us are up  ashley i was asleep  matt all right so between the three of you thankfully you had two successes against one  failure you manage to cover for your sister  liam shake it off  
none	 laura thank you thank you  matt  who who huh what what  laura ah what what  matt when you wake her up  liam sh sh  matt you guys quietly wait  travis oh no that was a bad expression  liam daggers out daggers out  ashley or that was good  matt all right so  laura oh no did eyebrows go up  taliesin whistles in the hall of the mountain king  matt the footsteps progress through and you theres no light source as duergar for the most  part do not 
dung	 require light to see in the tunnels  laura can we see through the dark but we can see in the dark  matt you guys have lowlight vision not dark vision  liam not dark vision  laura theres no light in this area at all  travis no its ballsass dark  liam theres no fire  matt no it is pitch black you just hear  liam on purpose no fire  matt  you just hear the footprints go by  travis good thing we didnt make a campfire  liam sh sh  matt you 
dung	 hear them approach the outskirts of the alcove  ashley i have dark vision gosh dang it  matt but youre asleep  ashley im fucking sleeping  matt yes you are  all laugh  ashley bad choices all around  liam theyre going  matt as the footsteps approach the outskirts of the alcove the rest of you sleeping soundly  unaware of whats transpiring a few moments pass and the footprints appear to be passing  past downward into the tunnel  all laugh  matt eventually when the footfalls dissipate and silence once again takes the 
none	 camp you breathe  a sigh of relief and remove your hand from vexs face  travis well maybe just leave it there  liam last time i did that i got kicked in the nuts very hard  travis and liked it  matt all right so eventually when you feel enough time has passed where those whove been  resting come from their sleep spells recovered wounds are healed except for those who didnt  sleep you guys maintain the same health you had previously  ashley what a good sleep ive had i have all my spells 
none	 back  matt that also puts a level of exhaustion so there is one level of  exhaustion on both of you currently  liam sure so what does that do to us  laura oh no  orion ah you fools  matt it just means any ability checks you take  liam yes  matt so any skills you take are at disadvantage until you get a full nights rest  travis ill take one more level two potion right now  liam skill skill okay  travis one more level two potion  matt okay you can 
none	 use remember you can use your hit dice to heal still before you start  throwing potions around if you have a moment to rest  laura hit dice we forgot about that because it wasnt there before  matt yeah sings fifth edition before you start throwing potions around cause remember  youre far away from civilization right now you have a very limited number of potions now to lead  you through here unless you find some way to return to the surface  liam just for emergencies  orion whats happening  liam in combat  matt 
none	 so you all eventually come back to consciousness in this darkened alcove pitch  black it is still warm slight smell of soot and dust in the air what do you guys want to do  liam i have a question  matt yes  liam outside of existence tiberius put up a stone right  matt mmhm  liam but i didnt hear any impact sounds right  laura oh no he put it up next to our alcove so they just kind of passed by our alcove  matt it basically matched the wall as you guys went 
town	 around  liam oh so we sealed ourselves into this little pocket  laura yes we did  liam oh we didnt even friggin need to hide in the tent we were in a little bubble of air  laura well no well its pillars though they could have  matt youre not completely in there  laura  they could have seen us  liam okay  matt he could block off most of it theres like little spaces between  liam spaces okay all right thank you  laura i think we should all freshen up since its 
none	 a new day  liam right were all healed maybe does anyone have to pee or perhaps  laura yeah that  ashley yeah  laura that  orion is anyone particularly dirty  laura intermission  matt indeed so this given the point in time that you all wake from your slumber well  continue this in a few minutes in the meantime were gonna go ahead and go to our intermission  break see you guys back here in about 12 minutes or so  marisha oh cool  zac so were gonna update everyone real quick

none	 was in the cart was  a large glass unit a containment unit that was sealed off you can see the inside of it has  slight scarring to the glass but it seems to be resistant to whatever the loose creature was  contained in it along the inside of the cart you notice there are a couple of just left over chunks  of flesh of different colors patches or pieces you see like part of a hand thats just in there  laura ew  matt partially decomposed to a certain extent it looks like these were 
none	 either used to feed  whatever the creature was in there or remnants of some other strange collection based on the best  you guys can ascertain this creature was part of the experimentationtype process that the weird  naga creature you fought earlier came from  laura oh great so there could be more  travis did we search the ogres  laura yeah loot the ogres  matt ogres are wearing nasty nasty tattered at this point hide armor  liam grog could do it  matt they both carry total amongst the two of them about 24 
none	 pieces of gold  laura sweet  travis i wanna take it  laura i add it to party funds  travis i am searching the ogres and i keep the 24 gold but i give two to vax  liam thank you  travis youre welcome  marisha can i go and grab shards of the broken glass of the case  matt if youd like to yeah so mark that in your inventory you have some handsized shards of  broken glass  travis and two to pike for healing me  ashley oh thanks  matt anything 
none	 else you guys wish to do in this section  liam so we searched the ogres thats it i guess we should just start walking further down  travis you take a poo on the black puddle of acid  taliesin i think well no thats the only heat source thats the only lava there was and now  its cool  matt and now it has cooled yeah  taliesin okay never mind then  marisha sorry  taliesin its all right i think its worth it  travis id like to take a hit dice  matt okay 
none	 go ahead and do that as many as youd like  liam lets rest for a halfhour or so  laura yeah  matt take a moment you can spend any hit dice now that you need to to heal yourself just make  sure to mark how many youve used  taliesin i just hear the sounds of ones  matt all right as you guys take a moment to heal yourselves you pull yourselves back up to your  feet and you tread further down this tunnel another 2530 minutes of the slight curvature and  it gets 
none	 steeper and steeper until eventually it opens up into a familiar cavern to some of you  you see a large waterfall pouring down from above  ashley gasps  laura mother bitches  marisha it looped around  matt you are on the outskirts of where the next tunnel opens up where there are a few small  streams of lava pouring from the ceiling you look above and you can see the top of the downward  cavern theres the giant lake beneath and across the way you can see the waterfall where clarota  was originally discovered 
dung	  marisha well we should go pick up trinket  taliesin at least you get your bear  laura gasps trinket  marisha lets go pick up trinket  laura oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  travis youre going to get your bear killed  liam can you explain i dont think i understand  marisha we left trinket over there  liam can you explain with your map matt  matt yes  marisha were at the bottom of the cave  orion we went down and just  liam i get we doubled back but it would help 
none	 the visual i think  matt yeah so and ill have more of this for you guys next week  travis it was a warp tube  matt the path you guys took was essentially lead to this back area which ill draw for next  week and a tunnel that curved all the way around and exited right there  laura so were  liam all right well go get your bear  laura well go get trinket and then well go down the path we should have gone down in the  first place next week  marisha 
none	 son of a bitch  taliesin except we get trinket  laura but trinket  marisha so its not useless  laura it was absolutely useless  liam thats fate thats kismet  marisha is there like any other way down here  matt other than the fact youve completely destroyed one of the mind flayer generals as well  as the one helming the war camp above youve acquired new magical items and defeated one of the  abominations that was created for the siege war i think you accomplished quite a few things though  maybe not as 
none	 directly as you were hoping  taliesin and we acquired our bear  laura we got our bear back  matt all right so you taking the flying carpet its a very precarious journey  as the weight limit for the carpet  liam you go on it right  laura hes with me and he cast featherfall  matt you can go ahead and cast fly on your bear trinket awkwardly bear noises manages to swim  her way down to the bottom floor  laura come trinket come  matt as you make your way to the base 
none	 of the watery lake at the bottom you can see a swish to  the water and a very familiar sight briefly shows itself in the distance as you see a slick domed  fishlike head protrude with a few tentacles in the distance you all instinctively step quite a  distance away and it seems to withdraw back into the water  marisha can i while i see it real quick im going to go ahead and channel  and cast beast sense through it  matt nothing bestial of it this is not a natural creature  marisha 
none	 good to know  matt clarota once again whispers to the rest of you stay at bay the aboleth is dangerous  laura aboleth  marisha aboleth  matt you all step back and turn now into the the tunnel that extends further into the heart of this  mountain you see streams of lava pouring from the top occasionally and one central flow of molten  rock tends to fill half of the cavern like a small river heading down into the base of the  mountain this is very familiar to you as its the path that your 
none	 dream took you  ashley guys this is really familiar to me  all laugh  laura we spent a whole game doing  marisha well we took a wrong turn i guess  liam i dont know we were flexing our muscles a little bit  laura flexing our muscles  marisha yeah i like it  laura plus you got us new armor out of it  travis and i got naked too  matt as you guys begin to step into the next lengths of your subterranean journey well pick  that up next week thank you
