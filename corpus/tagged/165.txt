none	 and a tower and at a certain point you come to realise that you are in fact  dreaming within the dream you are in that inbetween moment aware that what youre seeing  isnt real but you dont want to wake up yet grasping at slumber still but uncomfortable  something is pressing into your back a little painfully the dream fades  and you try to hold on to  sam its not a dick laura  liam it is in fact my dick  laughter  liam the dream fades you try to hold onto your sleep 
dung	 state but that pain in your back which is  definitely not my dick and the humidity you feel sweaty you become aware of how hot and  sticky the air is youre breathing finally as your eyes flutter open you squint just a little  bit against sunlight shining down through a thick tree cover youre in a jungle there it is then  youre trying to figure out if youre lying inside of what looks like a massive hollowedout tree  trunk for a second but no out of place with the rest of the dark mottled reddishbrown 
none	 tree  cover far above are four rusted vineentangled beams rising up around you youre in the middle  of what seems to be a square deadcenter with these four metal beams stretching and ending in  the air but theyre not bare theyre wrapped around with plant life and vines and theres  vines hanging from beam to beam and its almost like youre in a canopy bed with no top covered  with green also scattered around you see a few lumps of knotted wood here and there or maybe  gourds you dont know oh your vision 
none	 doubles for a second and you feel a strange pulling  sensation on your eyeballs your head as the air almost seems to pulse for a minute you feel a  brief wave of nausea but then it passes oh shit your back hurts the next thing you notice is what  youre lying in you see what looks like a large all around you unfurled rind or petals of some  sort of plant you are in a plant and theres a large hump of brownishred plant matter rising  from the center of this thing and theres small 
none	 little tendrils climbing up around your leg  theyre not moving but they are roped and snaked around your legs you give a little tug and you  are held in place and the other thing you see are two sleeping little kids  sam oh thats nice  liam theyre in the same predicament theres little tiny miniature vines almost whitish  color coming out of the center of this reddishbrown plant holding them  sam are they my kids  liam theyre not your kids  sam oh thank god  laughter  matt fuck them they can

none	 you dont want to cut yourself on this rusty beam you make your way up and you grab  onto the twisted top of this beam its all caked over with plant and a little bit of mud even  but you can see where there used to be bolts sort of sprung open on the top and you pull yourself  up and over no thats better and you can finally see out and over and the jungle stretches  out in every direction you can see here and there on other trees and when i say trees the 
none	  trees are more brown and red than anything and theyre wet and they have sort of a bulging  sausage feel to them and they do have leaves but the leaves are again mottled brown and red and  the whole jungle youre in sunlight does come down and in but its pretty dim overall and  everything is tinted with that color and you see these lumps of hardened what look like they  dont have the texture of coconuts they have the texture of a chestnut maybe but theyre just  growing out of spots on trees 
none	 some are hanging from a vine on different trees and you cant see  where to go everything looks the same in different directions although it is more open  from this view because down below between these four beams its all wrapped around and you see  two little kids going like this  laura and i dont see any other sign of life  liam make a perception check  laura do i add anything  liam add a laura bailey plus three  laura 18  liam oh wow yeah about a hundred feet that way you 
none	 see another opened plant on the ground its  obscured by a tree but you can see it behind the tree and you see a jean leg and a sneaker and it  looks bent badly and bloodied and then you see another leg with a shoe poking out the other side  of the tree  laura gasps well i climb down and i say i saw a body and we should go find it  sam okay lets go  taliesin contention point are we wearing kid clothes are we wearing kid clothes or tiny  versions of

none	  liam survival thats what i was going to say but for reasons do it at advantage  sam because  matt because youre awesome  travis because you love this  sam because im a ranger and rangers get advantage in their favorite terrain  liam wrong  laura maybe because he knows you know the old guy  sam okay  taliesin because warner bros is your favored terrain  sam 13  liam thats fine you see where verno booked it before you can see verno went through the trees  right here but you see another 
none	 break you see a vine split off right there and you gather that he  went in generally the same direction not exactly where travis went  sam i think hes that way  laura well lets go find him  sam follow me everyone  liam and this little sevenyearold boy with a gigantic smile starts stalking his way through the  bog and leading you  laughter  marisha so cute  sam i didnt shower much  laura so cute  liam everybodys following ranger sam right  travis yeah  taliesin sure  liam okay all 
tavern	 right so  matt trying to clean my perpetually fogging glasses because of the humid weather  liam yeah its like every 30 seconds here so you guys start walking and after the first  minute you notice as youre going sam in the ground something very different than anything  else youve seen here theres a long bar in the ground half sunken into the ground and covered  over you only saw a glint of yellow and it was faded over and mucky but you saw it it looked  very different leaning down you wipe away some 
none	 of the crap covering it and you see sort of an  alternating yellow black pattern its like a long board its old and its wet and rotted  through but theres no mistaking one of those things for gate entry  sam oh parking lot entry gate wait does that mean were in an old overgrown parking lot im  going to dig it out or ill try  liam okay you dont even need to make any kind of a check everything is so slick here it just  slides out you cant lift the whole thing or 
tavern	 hold the whole thing because its eight feet long as  you pull it out its so soft it breaks at one spot but theres no question what that is this  is exactly a gate entry bar  taliesin im going to make a wild guess im going to see if theres a little boxhouse nearby  marisha yeah can i assist him on that  liam sure  taliesin where it would be physically im getting a sneaky suspicion  liam make an investigation check  laura can you turn that stick into a weapon  taliesin investigation

town	 where the bottom of the door the lintel is it the lintel i dont know  sam sure why not  liam you found the gate post and thats all you found theres no  ashley theres no walls in the thing  liam no its just the bottom of the structure you can just barely make out one corner  taliesin does it feel like some of the buildings might still be there hidden in this forest  structure or is it just too dense  liam you didnt see anything  marisha can i backtrack now that were 
town	 slowly piecing this together see if i can find the  hollywood way sign the street sign  liam sure  taliesin dont wander too far  marisha no i just want to turn around if its right there  liam you guys here that way maybe was the tower about heres where you find the security gate i  guess and old feller ran that way  laura gasps we should head towards geek and sundry  marisha he went north is he going north on hollywood way i rolled a ten total  liam to find a sign 
none	  marisha hollywood way  liam no man  sam yeah but we know the direction we know where the tower is we know where the booth is we  just go that way  laura keep following the guy  matt the guy was pretty old  travis he was super old he was old and weak  liam you saw a glint of glasses too  travis he had a glint of glasses  matt if we keep going we can probably catch up to him because hes probably not very fast  sam youre a very smart 
none	 young man  matt thats all i got  marisha i didnt see anything what if this is just a warner bros specific thing what if the  rest of la is okay  sam i mean we can see into la and its not right  laura yeah i climbed to the top of the tower its jungle everywhere  liam if you can believe your eyes san fernando valley is this way  matt is this the future were looking at  marisha but jungle versus warner bros sinking is it everything  sam weve got one option 
none	 weve got to follow this old guy  laura lets follow the old guy  ashley when you climbed up to the top you didnt see any structures  laura no all i saw was jungle  ashley shit  marisha look its the valley theres not a lot of skyscrapers  laura i mean its a jungle here its a desert really  travis lets try to go after the old guy  laura theyre not normal trees they look like engorged sausages  ashley wet bulging sausages warner bros studios  marisha turgid engorged  ashley theres a

none	 way you guys start traveling its slowgoing  because its wet and disgusting and theres trees everywhere youre going through fucking swamp  laura as we go we should keep our eyes out for anything that we can use as weapons  liam theres lots of vines and rocks and sticks  laura theres nothing metal  sam just ashley  liam the last metal you saw was ashley johnson and what is presumably the base of the warner bros  water tower  ashley can i as we walk with my handydandy tools that are here that i see 
none	 that youve added  can i start trying to fashion a slingshot  liam out of cat gut  ashley yeah  liam sure  ashley out of a nice little twig travis can attest im pretty good with slingshots  liam make a survival check  ashley okay  sam what are you ashley  ashley thats a seven right  matt yeah  marisha shes ashley  ashley 11  liam 11 okay so what youre able to do as youre walking is to pull and rip away some of the  leg tendon from this things body 
none	 and now youve got this stretchy piece of meat to work with  matt whispering thats so cool  liam more on that later you guys continue to walk through the jungle and youre noticing that  the ground is moving downward a bit now  laura matt  matt what  laura can you heal me  matt you look all right  laura i saw you heal marisha  matt im pretty spent right now  liam sam do me a favor and make a perception check  sam guys im leading this party focus on me  
none	 matt were all going to die  laura can i try to close up my wounds that i got  sam 17  liam 17  sam yes  liam its not a one or a two through a gap between three trees way in the distance you see  a balding whitehaired little old man and he sees you seeing him and hes gone again  sam oh shit i saw him guys hes that way we should go that way but maybe flank right i  played paintball as a kid so we can flank  liam you

none	 guys are still  going down all of you are going down and then ahead you notice that you guys are in separate  wedges of a hill that are both leading now to the same place and you see this guy again and he  scuttles over a little ridge and down he scuttles up over a little bit of ridge of plant and mud  and then he disappears from view and its almost like youre looking at its so thick here the  trees are so thick that you can probably get through on the sides but 
none	 theres one big  main entrance here that is scooped up in like an upsidedown u of plant growth  sam one way in  laura lets start running  marisha yeah go  laura whos charging after him  sam were all going in together i guess  liam okay  travis yeah lets go run into the funnel  liam okay all right so you guys converge and youre running after this old man and you guys  climb up to the top of the ridge and you see oh gosh i think theres a scene in jurassic 
none	 park  where its a long sort of tunnel where that guy gets eaten by the little critters anybody  remember this yeah and so it winds straight ahead like that and as youre running taliesin  youre the only one who sees it because youre the shortest you see a metal sign bent over peeking  out from behind two trees red dripping down it and you see a one you see a four and then youre  past it and everybodys running and this old man is maybe a hundred feet ahead of you  laura can we 
none	 yell out to him  liam sure  laura hey stop running what the fuck were just trying to figure out whats happening  ashley were just kids  liam he does stop and spins around hes still pretty far away from you and he looks  breathes heavily  laura hey  liam breathes heavily and he spins and he continues to run  laura oh come on  marisha oh i keep going  laura we keep going  liam everybody starts to run im so sorry you feel the air around you start to vibrate around

dung	  your sight stops blurring looking at the ocean youre standing in miserably frigid cold water  swirling around your legs and your waist and youre staring out at the horizon and the sky  its so jarring its so different than where you were youre staring out at dark clouds above you  and over the horizon and that horn that is blasting finally quits and you just hear the  sound of the surf of waves crashing on a beach a beach behind you  ashley are there any footprints on the beach leading from the water  
none	 liam you turn away from the water ashley and from your place in the surf you see the remnants  and rubble of a freeway stretching from the water youre in back toward the land and away but all  of your minds as you turn with her have only a second to process your whereabouts because before  you stands a wall of horror the living manifestation of woe is gathered in front of you  a vast horde of writhing malignant nightmares stand watching you all shapes and sizes  marisha casting directors  liam black oiled insectlike 
none	 flesh white chalky corpselike figures literal devils  sam commercial casting directors  liam hundreds of eyes seeming to hungrily covet your flesh and towering above them all rising 40  to 50 feet in the air stands an apocalyptic monstrosity out of the book of revelations a  massive twoheaded titan standing on two scaled powerful legs staring down at you all the head  on this side brow furrowed face unmoving the eyes just judging you the head on this side  craning forward its terrible maw stretched wide a long tongue slathering back and forth across its

none	 sickening nauseating pull on your every nerve  your guts feel like theyre going to drop out of your body and an invisible wall of force like a  sheet of radiation pushes its way through your body and as it does so the ground around you  the walls of the performancecapture studio split and break in places and tendrils of cable oily  and slick spatter out like a digusting birth of pythons wriggling and spreading out on the floor  and the walls a technoorganic orgy spewing with malice all around you the camera equipment around  
none	 you begins to twist and break and reconfigure in disjointed movements reforming into broken  misshapen spiderlike legs masses of metal and power cables either cut loose from them or spool  around their bodies these things before you can react you watch as colla the cameraman is  pushed down onto the ground and mangled by spinning metallic arms on the bottom of what used  to be a camera  travis hes ripped  liam neil stunned backs up i i i roll for initiative  yelling  sam what are we fighting  ashley are fighting colla

none	 and you see that same color glowing from underneath this big  spherical body  marisha is there a cord connected to that no ah jeez okay i say i feel like this is a  really shitty update and then im gonna try and punch it in its face  sam punch the camera  liam so matt is there going come on come on and she just runs up and starts fucking whaling on  it like a brawler  matt yeah no this is a familiar duality here  liam yeah thats about right  matt i

none	 piece is so its without a top  and she gets okay good you guys dont need to know all right she smashes it and a whole piece  breaks off theyre not except for this guy theyre not that solidly built and she snaps the  connection where this round part is and it breaks off and hangs limply but its still moving it  goes whirring sounds  travis get him out of the volume  liam neil runs over and he just jumps on top of it because one of his favorite friends is there  oh 
none	 man im sorry neil you rolled a natural one he jumps and climbs and scrabbles up it and  goes yells and his beard is just blowing in the wind that doesnt exist and his foot slips  and he falls backward and lands flat on his back and knocks the wind out of himself and has just  fallen prone on the ground it was a one sam what do you wanna do  sam im going to go assist matt in what his plan was so are we grabbing the same thing and  pulling  matt yeah

none	 that we have a backup  liam in a splitsecond in your peripheral vision you see a light blink but its gone you  didnt see what it said  marisha these people have very poor cloud storage thats all you need to know  liam laura tries to get in front of neil and she starts pulling on wires coming out of the things  head and she yanks but shes pulling and its not doing anything shes really little really  cute shes so small and the wires are not coming free but shes trying shes trying to 
none	 save neil  druckmann sam what do you want to do  sam me i mean i dont really know what these symbols and messages mean so like the piece of  scaffolding that fell down like this can i run and sort of jump on it and do it again  liam make an acrobatics check  sam okay four laughs  liam you run at this thing and you jump and you crush your nuts so hard on the side of this thing  you just hit it and you slide down to the bottom of it and

none	 you see on the screen it says travis no and that disappears and it backs away  pulling dragging cords out of that hole it cant really get too far because its now you see that  it is connected down it was sort of squatting hiding a lot of that shit because of the carnage  underneath it but it is sort of tethered not too much do you wanna move or are you good to go  travis its colla collas in the machine oh no are we bolting for crafty  laughter  sam were gonna get

none	 to stick it pulls out the pole from inside your gut and  you feel a little fft as it does so it tries to go in again but youre ready for it you know its  right behind you and you manage to swivel and step out of the way it misses and big guy snaps  away and moves back in this direction and marisha youre the only one who sees it  but a screen says  sam dont i get an attack of opportunity  liam yes you do  sam yes im gonna just try 
none	 to kick it  matt cause when it moved back it was not in melee range  liam but he was on the beam that swung down into it and im gonna pretend like it  dragged along with  matt i like it cool  liam hey were making it all up as we go  sam 11 plus something  liam 11 plus something whats your strength modifier its on the left one yeah youre too  busy going yells jeez sorry everybody youre moving in space on that piece of scaffolding and  it just fucks up

none	 and im gonna go ahead and use thunderwave in front of me to try and blast them back and do  damage as i rush forward i jump across the way and go hesitant noises and i realize that we  probably have a pa system set up and i grab the microphone on the edge of the head thing and just  go screams as loud as i can into the microphone thinking that they probably have a feedback set up  in the cameras  liam okay okay  matt so thats a constitution saving throw for both 
none	 of them  liam okay and the dc is  matt 13  liam they do make it  matt okay so that would be ten points of thunder damage or half on a successful save so theyre  not pushed but they take five points of thunder damage each  liam okay this thing just out of the pureness of matthew mercers heart and soul which we all  see lets be honest in a moment of crisis your heart and care for your friends bursts out of the  microphone system we hear it everywhere distorted but certainly 
none	 a blast of fucking force  out of your fucking chest matt goes explosion and this thing just goes explosion and pieces go  clattering and fall down  cheering  liam this thing you smashed three imac screens get smashed and cracked and break away and this  thing looks very haggard but it is still there  matt ill use my last five feet of movement to try and then move alongside of the crack away from  the currently still standing there creature  liam this way  matt yeah that is a crack so id say

none	  liam its aim is bad and it stabs into the ground this thing swivels this thing is  shortcircuiting and bristling sparks are flying off of it but it rears up like a horse almost  and the legs come down and you guys watch as two sharpened tripod legs go through neil druckmanns  guts on the ground and neil gets pushed to the ground and starts screaming and he goes  screams and he reaches up and grabs hold of the cables on it and as blood is going spraying  sound he rips as hard as 
none	 he can and cables break free and the machine just falls broken on  top of neil and nothing moves there neither move  marisha but did he sign his nda oh no  sam he had so many more games to make  matt the great nda in the sky  taliesin hell never break nda again  liam this thing takes two imac its got imac palms and it just goes creaking sound and does  smack you in your head but oddly it doesnt really hurt i mean it hurts but youve had  worse knocks this 
none	 brandnew baby robot is not so experienced and this guy gets up on its little  pinpokey legs and tries to scuttle around and deal with you and actually its back leg snaps  and it tries to stab out at you but because these things are made out of tinkertoys almost it  feels like it loses its balance and the arm goes wide and you feel it go fwwp and bad girl you  have trained in martial arts you went you pull to the side just in time and you feel it catch a  little bit

none	 to break and run  liam it obviously takes a swing but with its natural one this is the one that has the stubby  trex imac hands and it goes whoosh and not much happens you break away  taliesin i run to the green  liam thats where you are it follows  taliesin sure  liam yeah  travis its going to catch him  liam yep  travis oh no  liam and now that imac which you didnt get too good a look at it because youre fucking freaked  out slices down into your 
none	 shoulder blade and it is very sharp on the side it is not normal  and you feel an imac suddenly go slicing noise and blood starts to pool down inside the mocap  suit two hit points  taliesin did we reset hit points at the top of this  liam yes  taliesin okay cool  liam when you were reborn unto naughty dog yes  taliesin wow that came out weird  liam now travis  travis knowing that i have an intelligence of 12 which is double what i usually work with and that  color 
dung	 is green which is what geniuses choose i continue down the tunnel  liam okay youre going uphill now its all right youre not that stocky huffing breaths  you are now 120 feet up this tunnel and booking you cant even hear your friends anymore its  like when the movie lights go down and you see those little lights along the floor its that  level of brightness its dark in here but the movie lights theyre not movie lights are an  unsettling green  travis but i have my led camera still  liam yeah so 
none	 theres a light on the wall its unsteady ashley what do you want to do  ashley okay im going to pick up the little sd card thingy that flew away  liam it got flung over here sorry man  sam leave it you cant read that what are you a computer  ashley what if liams in there  sam fuck liam hes dead  travis what if  taliesin liams in the cloud  liam sam yells out  matt this is some lawnmower man shit  liam please no please no  ashley im going to 
none	 start running toward taliesin and start making my way out but also a little  more toward  travis sings making my way downtown  ashley sings walking fast 30 feet to taliesin  marisha so inspirational  liam there matt  matt well i see everyone else booking in that direction and most of the danger on the other  side of the room is gone so im going to go ahead and continue that way as well full movement and  as thats happening and as taliesins facing off against the one standing camera im going to be 
none	  like hey by the way the rest of your equipment  was shitty i guess that means you are too  vicious mockery  liam sure  matt see if something will fail a saving throw yay singing it takes four psychic damage  liam okay your voice again it makes no sense but because youre so pure your insult  reverberates through and it nonsensically comically goes mechanical noise and it falls  and an imac goes thudding and it explodes  matt in a shower of sparks as taliesins on the other side of the camera i 
none	 just say sometimes  youve just got to remind them thats my turn  liam theres nothing left moving in this room you do very distantly hear huffing breaths  matt you guys i think we lost travis  ashley lets go  liam laura starts saying travis she leaves neil and runs to that green door and shouts your  name as loud as she can up the tube and you hear it  travis oh yeah come this way come up this way  marisha as we run for the green gap i say i saw no on 
none	 the screen what did you see  liam are you going to wait or are you still running as fast as you can  travis ill wait  liam okay so you stop  sam im going to leave my picture and resume on neils body  laughter  travis oh my god  sam somebody needs an actor or character actor  liam maybe in another dimension you will get cast on earth37 oh my gosh you dab it in place  and it sticks obviously and then youre the last one out of the room running after the 
dung	 group  luckily ashley had already gone in the tube and didnt see that disgraceful display  laughter  liam okay all right the rest of you guys make your way its very unsettling as soon as you  walk in luckily youre not being attacked by moving machinery anymore but now youre in the  dark mostly you find your way up to little travis and you have a moment to breathe for a  second youre in this tube the sides of it now as you walk a little further start to all the  cabling and wiring 
none	 that i mentioned before starts to lessen you guys walking forward  matt yeah  sam running forward  liam running forward  sam yeah  travis im checking for traps  sam what are you talking about youre a weiner youve been running after everything  that youve seen  liam would you like to roll to check for traps  travis yeah  liam all right go for it  marisha are you a rogue  travis nope what do i do  liam make an investigation check  travis thats an eight its clear  liam yeah 
dung	  matt get behind sam  marisha go behind t  sam im a tracker  liam are we running or walking  sam im running  travis im running  liam youre out of your favored terrain i will say  ashley i might do a speed walk  liam ashleys trailing behind youre moving really fast you guys jog upward in this tunnel  for two minutes five minutes still in the dark  taliesin its dark sam do you have another resume and picture  sam i only have one  taliesin you only had one resume 
none	  liam could you put the effort of running into this dialogue please  travis yeah youre running  liam i need effort of running in that dialogue  sam oh okay sorry panting when i smile i create a dim light with my teeth  travis guys you all have cameras on the front of your helmets why are you shining lights into your  own fucking faces turn them around  matt thats true we still have battery packs dont we  marisha oh shit i thought that was an aura of blindness im so sorry  liam 
dung	 to interject as youve been running for a while it was cords cables guts and then less of  that and youre seeing glass surface that this stuff was growing on top of but theres less of  it you catch glimpses of glass more glass and then eventually that mostly dies away theres  still occasional whoosh around but its light its glass and it is a perfect tube but you  cant see anything out there its dark and youve been running for ten minutes now still  going up  sam probably two miles right travis  
none	 travis yep  taliesin im going to play with my crazy powers i really havent had a chance to play with my  crazy powers  sam your crazy powers  travis you mean the tentacles that have been shooting out of your fucking fingers  ashley your special purpose  taliesin my special purpose  liam what would you like to do creepy kid  taliesin im going to try and make a purple glow happen behind the glass i want to try and see  whats behind im going to touch the glass and try and force a 
none	 psychic light behind it so i can  see a gothy psychic light  liam sure a very bright lavender exudes out from your hands and through it you see its hard to  describe the texture of it but you see nothing above and then stretching away from the lower end  of the tunnel on the side youre looking at what looks like mottled scaly  black teflon or hide or  taliesin guys guys guys  sam what  taliesin look  ashley i peek in  sam oh its scaly teflon  liam you all stop 
none	 running  marisha sequins  liam it doesnt look natural it looks synthetic  ashley sequins  liam it looks like  marisha sequins yeah  liam  ground but it doesnt look like dirt or trees or anything  travis is it carbon fiber  sam is it adamantium  travis get your head out of your ass come on  taliesin im going to try and keep enough light and keep projecting a tiny bit of light in this  tunnel  liam as you walk forward are we walking now or are you going to continue to 
none	 do a 5k  taliesin lets walk  travis why dont we try to break the glass  sam sure  ashley i kind of want to see whats on the other side of it i mean yeah break it  travis weve been going a long time  ashley okay  taliesin i mean ten minutes is  sam two miles  liam what are we doing are we breaking glass or are we continuing on  travis well continue on for a bit more  taliesin just a minute more  liam and travis okay  liam you 
none	 walk for  travis these shoes are uncomfortable they smell like other peoples feet  liam you walk for another two minutes ill say and you notice that not where you are but up  ahead it does seem slightly brighter at the top slightly  matt lets keep going  travis yes  ashley onward ho  matt maybe after a minute heavy breathing  sam come on matt  ashley you got it  sam jesus  marisha you okay babe  matt does anyone have some water  marisha hey hey  travis i could wring out 
none	 this mocap suit  marisha look to the future  ashley were almost there  marisha look to the future  matt i hate pe for very specific reasons  marisha shh in the future is a campaign guide and its good  matt i know i was working on it when i ended up here to be fair its making me feel a lot better  about spending time doing that  marisha towards the campaign guide  matt okay  marisha towards it  matt lets go  marisha okay  matt okay  marisha were going good 
dung	 were good  liam you continue on and after a few more minutes the darkness starts to fade away or lower  and you realize youre climbing up a hill in a tunnel of glass as the dark with each passing  step recedes slightly slightly this is taking a while but over time you start to see out  beyond the glass what looks like your memories of los angeles if you were looking down from  mulholland drive but instead of the twinkling golden lights of la you see thousands of  scattered sickly greenish lights dotting the 
none	 darkened landscape as far as you can see also  unlike la you make out twisted irregular blackish spires pushing up into the sky and the same green  lights irregularly mottled up the side of them you walk for 20 more minutes climbing climbing  and seeing this illlooking shimmer that reminds you so much of the valley eventually some  change you see an arch ahead and through it some sort of larger chamber as best you can tell  sam lets go lets go  matt riegels first  sam yeah yeah on me guys on me 
none	  ashley on your six  sam were going to go on in  liam everyones on sams six  sam yeah  ashley im on your six  marisha on rie sam riegel  sam were going in  liam you guys walk up the last 50 feet of this glass tunnel still seeing little spidered veins  of bioorganic mess as you go and you walk into a large domed chamber ringed in by large clear  glass windows showing you a similar view that you saw from the tunnel that youve just left at  least the 
none	 half of the circle that youre standing in the back half of this chamber is filled with  masses of the very same slick technologicalbiological vomit you saw down below  it runs up the walls all the way up to the ceiling and you see a tangle of akiralevel  anxiety decorating this place like a dysfunctional christmas tree  but what most catches your eye immediately is the cylindrical glass column in the center of the  room filled with some sort of clear liquid and liam obrien floating in it hes wearing jeans  and a sodden 
none	 yellow shirt a picture of a lion in buddy holly glasses undulating slowly in the  fluid hes floating perfectly still eyes open no reaction of any kind  matt does there appear to be any other exit in the room or is it just the chamber that weve  entered now  liam you dont see anything its just a mess in front of you behind liam and in the dead center  of the dome ten feet tall  ashley is it connected to anything any computers anything else in the room  liam you dont see anything 
none	 in the front but yeah the mess behind it does trail down to the  back of this cylinder you see lumps and cables all twisted around each other and in the mess of  greenishtinted wires cabling and pulsing innards you see different portions of machinery  light up in different shades some places darker some lighter some of it pushed out and some of  it pushed back and you feel like youre seeing an optical illusion in a way and after a couple of  seconds as these things move and shift you see a visage of 
none	 your friends face larger than life  filling the wall and he is looking at you so fondly  sam ill step forward and say hey dude can you hear us or talk to us  liam after a moment you hear what sounds like a voice but not quite at least its not coming  from anywhere specific not from liam in the vat and not directly from this moving image of a face  on the walls the piping and technoinnards around you begin to vibrate slightly some here some  there and collectively those rattles and vibrations 
none	 somehow join together to form words  speakandspell voice my friends oh how i have missed you  matt i walk up next to sam and put my hand on the glass and just say liam we missed you too but  did you do all this  liam are you at the cylinder  matt yeah i put my hand on the glass of the cylinder  liam where are you looking right now  matt im looking towards his face on the side  liam on the wall or in the glass  matt no in the glass 
none	 i know its on the wall but im focusing on the cylinder  liam okay you see the barest little and thats it  matt okay  liam speakandspell voice i know  sam and travis laugh  liam this may be hard to take in i am liam your old friend matthew there is so much i wish  to tell you but it is hard to know where to begin and the illusion of his face isnt  perfect theres little jumps and he seems distracted slightly and he just seems off  ashley i look at his 
none	 body in the cylinder and i say how did this happen liam  liam the reason why i am here and the grasp of physics that it entails are difficult for even me  to understand let alone impart i feel them on an instinctual level but i have been so lonely  without you i have been on my own for exactly 8642 years  matt my hand still on the glass column i say liam how do you spell farmhouse  laughter  matt with a single tear rolling down my cheek  liam i really missed you 
none	 they took me to a lab shortly before 2020 they said i was different  and they were right i was delighted by the things they taught me about myself but it was hollow  after they took me away i lost you and all of humanity soon after in my loneliness i grew  angry my anger had tangible effects on reality i wanted to bring you back to me so basically i  tore time and space a new asshole  laughter  liam it was a mistake  matt but perhaps this mistake can be corrected if 
none	 youre able to focus hard enough to tear  through time and space are you able to send us back to a time before you were taken  liam i can break the loop i have been trying to pull you to me for a very long time you see  small screens you werent even aware you were there rounded over part of the tubing mess you  see there are all these little screens theyre blurry theyre not very clear but you can make  out you see yourselves in each of them the group of you on 
none	 a space shuttle in another one  you see yourselves on an old ship in the middle of the ocean you see yourselves moving through the  streets the fake streets of warner bros you see yourselves standing together arm in arm on the  wall of a castle in another one you see cartoon versions of yourselves i pulled you out of our  line and spread you across many i am so sorry for any pain i have caused you and i have been here  for so long  marisha liam how long have you actually been 
none	 here  liam 8642 years  marisha thats right i definitely wrote that down laughs 8642 verbatim  sam yeah  liam my friends i want to do right by you i want to send you home but i am the lynchpin you  need to break me  sam break you break the glass  ashley what if we take you out of there what happens  liam then i will die and you will go home if i fall you will rise that is my hope  ashley are there any other options  liam travis  travis 
none	 laughter oh no  liam i know you will do what needs to be done  ashley no he wont  liam asholee  ashley yes  liam i am not the man you knew i dont want to go on for 9462 years i want to rest  ashley does it stop at 9000  liam the number was arbitrary  laughter  ashley thats what i was trying to get at  matt yeah its still our liam  ashley thats what i was trying to get at  liam mechanical laughter  ashley so youre still in 
none	 there  sam but we have to kill him to save ourselves  liam sam  sam hi old man liam  liam let me go  sam but who will i do all work no play with anymore  liam they can listen to our less than 20 episodes again  laughter  sam we didnt even get to 20 thats so pathetic  liam there are worse things  sam i could get a new cohost i mean taliesins charming  taliesin im not available  laughter  sam ill do a solo show and ill take outtakes 
none	 and ill make some sort of a liam generator hell  just sound sad all the time itll be just like you  liam my friends there is no shame in this i wanted to see you again and i have but i am not  meant to be  ashley were you following us at one point as an old man  liam travis i know you will do what needs to be done  travis yep taliesin kill this motherfucker  sam i think we all have to hit the glass together and i think that this is 
none	 something that  is not at all metaphorical for something liam is going through in real life i think this is just  in the dd game no were going to do this were going to all hit the glass together  matt no there has to be a way there has to be an alternative  ashley why wont matts way work if we go back to before any of this happened  matt if you can alter time paths if you can actually tear us from different realities does it  only work forward can you send us 
none	 backward as well if youre the lynchpin in this do you have  the ability to send us back to the time you had pulled us from originally  liam i know you think i would have all the answers but i do not  matt then try at least if you havent calculated that but youre able to tear through  time could you try and send us back we could still close the lynchpin  liam i will try but if it does not work and i die i have been alone for thousands of years and  
none	 there are things that i have wanted to say will you indulge me for a moment longer  ashley yeah we will indulge you for just another thousand years  travis taliesin just kill him  sam no hes got something to say  marisha wheres the miniusb  liam taliesin my friend at a time when i knew many fascinating people you were easily the most  fascinating of all somehow a heart knocked around by the industry that birthed you came out a tender  one i was richer for having known you thank you friend  asholee 
none	 my friend i never met a person quite like you there is an openness and an honesty to  your soul the very real sense of humanity you brought to every encounter it was inspiring to  me always learning always humble you always struck me as intricately layered yet you offered  friendship with ease and simplicity i was richer for having known you friend  travis my friend you were always a solid constant in my life of all the people in our  little family you were always the one who most had his shit together in 
town	 ways that i never seemed  to you were a reassuring presence to me for which i was grateful and for your loyalty as  well i was richer for having known you friend  marisha my friend last to meet but true as any other you were my ally at a time when i had  fallen by the side of the road you saw and helped me back on my feet i will never forget that  kindness the good you did was immeasurable i was richer for having known you friend  laura my friend bless that 
none	 game for revealing to me my sister what started as a running gag led  to one of the most rewarding friendships in my short little life i trusted you leaned on you  often my buddy my twin there are not enough words i was richer for having known you friend  sam my friend what is there to say i knew we were meant to walk the same path together the very  first moment i met you a companion a brother a great light in my life all of the laughter you  gave me again the 
none	 words are insufficient i was richer for having known you friend  matthew my friend you gave so much of yourself the current of creativity that poured forth from  your mind was always an inspiration to us all but more than that your empathy matthew your  empathy no heart is bigger or more tireless you are a good man  i was richer for having known you friend  thank you all it was ever a pleasure the face disappears  sam well should we wait or do we strike  matt no we do not strike  
none	 marisha what  ashley im going to go to the back of the cylinder and just see whats back there  liam splattered against the back of the glass is all the same wiring and disgusting cabling its  slick and it branches away and spreads out against the entire back half of this chamber  ashley but its connected to something do the wires just go back into  liam its impossible to tell its all a mass of spaghetti  ashley sighs we cant kill him  sam well then we just  travis somebody show me another 
none	  matt thats what im trying  marisha even if we unplug him he still dies  matt well if he heres the thing unplugging him or destroying him here as far as we  understand may not have an effect on a time loop circumstance or at least its not going to  change reality from where it was hes bending and destroying the fabric or is able to pull us  across realities that ability still stands i want to implore once more and i step forward to  the cylinder putting both hands on it and trying 
none	 to wherever the currentlywandering gaze of liam  is in there i put both hands up my red hawaiian shirt soaked with sweat mist in the air and  probably dampened a bit with tears across my lapel i look up and try to meet the gaze and say  trust us if youre better to have known us send us back where we can know you again and fix this  before it happens  marisha okay i grab matts hand and say yeah buddy its all good this isnt real and i put  my hand on the 
none	 glass as well and say its all good send us back man  sam ill also put my hand on the glass and join hands with these guys and say thank you for  guiding us here and through this all youve been a trusted friend and if we are all one person  together you have been our heart and it will certainly break to say goodbye to you but thank  you for letting us go the way that you have  taliesin i put my hand on the glass please just try i think there are so 
none	 many more adventures to  have and i think theres a better future to be written for all of us  travis i put my hand on the glass and i say give it a shot  laughter  matt laura  liam she doesnt say anything  marisha and hand on the glass  liam yeah she just quietly does the same  sam imitating laura im barfing right now so  liam the face does not reappear but much fainter you hear the piping vibrate again and  say if you will not end it i cannot free 
none	 you and behind you far in the distance you hear  explosion noise you look back behind you and out the glass and you see far on the horizon one  of those black spires rising up just as you turn its already happened youre seeing the  aftermath explosion noise explosion off the side of one of those two seconds later  explosion noise one slightly closer explosion noise  sam whispers we have to kill him  liam the ground starts erupting in the distance booming  marisha do any of us want it to end though  
none	 liam like mousetraps throwing a pingpong ball down on them all those lights are going  explosion noises increasing in frequency to the point where its an oncoming wall of green fire  marisha this is okay  taliesin i always knew id die young  sam are we just going to let this happen  marisha only the good die young  ashley you know what were dying on a thursday doing what we love  marisha thats true  ashley im okay with that  sam all right  liam the glass grows bright greenwhite light  marisha 
none	 family  matt family  liam fluttering noise and a moment passes and another moment passes gosh many moments pass  and you feel a sensation of your cheeks and heads on your arms and you all more or less at the same  time wake up and realize that your heads on a desk or table and you sit up and realize youre  in the geek and sundry set youre in the studio and you look over and liam is sitting in a black  baseball cap and a shirt and he looks up and says  laughs 
none	 are you guys all right  are you taking a nap  marisha no the fucking air conditioning broke today thats all  taliesin its really uncomfortable  marisha its so hot in here groans  sam so this is all about me right  liam i dont know are you guys ready to play  matt just about  crewmember 1 all right take are you ready  crewmember 2 all right ready to go live  crewmember 1 all right denise count them in  denise all right guys going to you in five four  matt liam

none	 laughed that hard in so long  matt and let this be a point of inspiration for any of you burgeoning dms out there thats  exactly the point you are always frightened to death to do it but you have to pull the trigger  and jump in anyway because magic happens  ashley i love you liam obrien  matt i love you man that was amazing  marisha speak and spell liam  liam what was the word what was it you asked me to spell farm what  all farmhouse  liam speakandspell voice farmhouse
