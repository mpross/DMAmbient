none	 terrorizing the countryside of taldorei occupying the city  of emon westruun and places beyond theyve managed to kill off all the members of the  conclave leading up to raishan the orchestrator behind the scenes of most of the chaos that  theyve seen in recent months raishan managed to nearly destroy vox machina before absconding with  the corpse of thordak apparently into the next portion of her plot the party upon running into  an old friend kerrek from westruun who had helped in the attack on emon joined forces to  give chase in hopes through 
none	 your decision to head her off at the pass and prevent raishan from  seeing to fruition whatever plan she had after this leg through a series of very wellplaced  scrys you discovered that she had absconded to the island of viscond an old lair of thordaks  and before that an older lair of opash an ancient necromancer who was banished and made that  his lair as you made your way to the island hopefully prepared for this youve fought through  various traps and difficult challenges throughout the necromancers sanctum eventually coming into  battle with 
none	 raishan herself a long hardfought battle left percy and scanlan both lifeless to the  ground percy was risen quickly scanlan unfortunately was not and the final blow  delivered a combination of both keyleth tearing the intellect from raishan through a wellplaced  feeblemind spell and kerrek with a wellplaced warhammer blow to the head of the green dragon  marisha high five  matt laughs high five from the screen  travis youre just hitting him in the face  talisin so awkward  marisha deuces  matt there you go  travis laughs deuces  matt the 
none	 dragon destroyed however their friend scanlan still lifeless and still growing colder  as the minutes passed picked up his body and you fled the cavern to the outside of the island after  discovering the teleportation or at least the magic of transport had some sort of an alteration  or a funkiness to it if you will you watched as two of your allies kima and allura were instead  of teleporting away through a circle sent deep out into the ocean you managed to find them  laughs through a very lucky perception roll  marisha laughs 
none	 nervously  matt and at least was able you were able to connect your transport via plants through one of  the outside trees by the beach to get you all to whitestone there you took scanlans body to the  recently constructed temple to the raven queen and in preparing for this ritual the gatestone was  taken by vex who with the help of the realmseer eskil ryndarien transported to kymal made your  way through the riffraff to one of the darkened taverns there to find kaylie scanlans daughter  longestranged and rambunctious daughter but daughter nonetheless 
tavern	 handed her the gatestone and  she vanished in a puff of arcane smoke leaving you and eskil more confused than you within the  tavern and that is where we jump back in for the evening  travis gagging noise  matt so as you guys are waiting carefully figuring out what to do in these moments pike as  youre cleaning the area cleaning the body and doing the best you can to begin preparing for a  ritual that you are hoping will be in the favor of you and your friends percy as you hold the 
none	 other  end of the gatestone you feel it begin to glow and warm in your hand and you instinctively take a  step back as within a bright flash fizzle sound you watch as kaylie the gnomish shorthaired  rambunctious bard stands there now near the entranceway to the raven queens temple holding  the other gatestone shes clutching it her face still stoic and confused by the sudden  transference she takes it and drops it to the ground  taliesin ill take that  marisha she found you  matt right good to see all of you 
none	  so is it true  taliesin yes clears throat hes inside  matt let me see the bastard  and she pushes past and muscles through you  whove just previously begun to walk into the temple slowly kind of taking in the gravity of the  situation and whether or not you want to even step up the plate on this in that quiet tense slow  but perpetual thought process that is grog you feel a small hand grab the side of your hip and  shove though to no effect you just feel a little tug 
none	 as kaylie pushes past you  pardon me big man  and you watch as she darts up to where pike is currently preparing the body for the ritual  ashley quick sigh  matt you watch as kaylie steps up to the edge and gets up onto the top of the central altar and  stands over quietly looking down over scanlans cold body she crosses her arms  he made me a promise  ashley i know  matt you made me a promise  and she leans forward kneels down and slaps him across the face cracking 
none	 sound  you made me a promise  and she gets up and sniffle wipes her nose a bit and hops off and just storms  ashley i run after her  matt okay she just keeps charging not stopping not slowing  ashley wait  matt you eventually get outside you guys watch as kaylie pushes past and then pike shortly  thereafter she spins around looking at you you can see her fists are clenched at her sides face  still dry but you can see the water just slightly barely keeping back in her eyes she goes 
none	  what  ashley listen i know how angry you are  matt sarcastically laughs  ashley but we need you here today so he can at least have more of a chance to be the father that  youve always wanted him to be  matt those days have passed im afraid  ashley you have no idea how much he loves you  matt laughs oh hes hes loved a lot of girls in his days that im certain  ashley that may be true but not as much as you  matt sighs well get on with 
none	 it then i figure at the very least we can go  about our business when this is over clear conscience and all that  how much time do you need  ashley as long as it takes  matt well have we time for a drink  ashley uh yes  matt im going to get a drink  and she just walks back into whitestone  travis am i still in there  matt youre still in there right now by yourself as pike just pushed past you and you  have scanlan alone on the altar  
none	 travis can i go over to him does he look the same  matt he looks the same justpaler hes been cleaned so the rest of you are a mess still but  hes clean his hair is pulled back and brushed a bit by pike as part of the preparation for the  ritual his clothes still tattered and worn from previous battles but  travis can i reach out and put my hand on his chest do i feel anything  matt nothing its cold to the touch hes been gone for a while now and theres very 
none	 little  difference between the touch of the stone hes on and the chest other than the fleshy texture  travis this is not over it cant be laughs weve done so much and we have so much more to do  right this is this is not over all right dont dont you move go ahead and get your shut eye and  well be back you rest here try not to have too much fun without us  and i leave  matt okay pike you go in and finish the preparations for the ritual and the ritual 
none	 itself  is an hour long once the spell is engaged youre just cleansing the temple some of the leaves that  have blown in whats everybody else doing in the meantime  liam im just an assistant  marisha same  taliesin im organising getting any materials that we need  matt okay kerrek  patrick im keeping my distance  but watching what it is that theyre getting ready to do here  im half way between disbelief and wanting to see how somebody else runs their priestly this is  sort of like a professional interest what is 
dung	 this guy doing to appease the raven queen this way  matt alrighty you finish preparations kaylie hasnt returned at that moment about ten minutes  more pass and you hear small footsteps begin to make their way to the outside of the temple  there stepping through a little wobbly but a stoic stone faced kaylie her hair kind of damp  and slicked back with her fingers  as she comes through  sniffs all right lets get it over with  and you can smell the alcohol she stumbles up to the temple and puts her hands on the 
none	 altar  so do your thing  travis hold on look at me  matt she turns around and looks up at you as she is practically just past your thigh  travis its so funny i never realized it before you look so much like him  matt well be careful im at the right height to be juggling your laughs halfheartedly  travis id expect no less  laughter  matt she lingers on your eye contact for a second gives a nod  she gives you a tap  and turns back around and puts her hands on 
none	 the altar  travis groans right  laughter  ashley okay i guess well go ahead and get started sighs shakily  matt all right so as pike takes her holy symbol out and begins preparing and burning the incense  you conscious that while you are a follower of sarenrae you are in the space of the raven queen  take heed to make sure that the symbols you prepare as part of the ritual are a union of the  symbols of redemption which call to your divine nature and the cycle of life that are indicative  
none	 of the raven queens spheres of both fate and passing  you orchestrate them in a way that is  synergistic so that there is a definitive intent to not let this lifeline sever as you finish the  completion of these various symbols and glyphs spreading the salts across with each line that is  drawn you then begin to gather everyone around the altar itself closing the doors behind you  you pull out the diamond component of this resurrection ritual if you want to mark it off  within your gear either if you have a diamond worth 
none	 1000 gold or just mark 1000 gold off  laura theres a diamond  matt at which point you take the diamond and place it over scanlans chest and you begin  uttering the incantation what begins as a small whisper begins to echo and you hear the source of  the voice from pike but within a minute its almost like the voice is sourceless it begins to  fill the room it seeps from every corner we hear pike from all sides and the more she begins to  chant the more you hear this very faint chorus 
none	 begin to join in a harmonizing voice a secondary  harmonizing voice and you are familiar with this this is the initiation of the ritual this is the  reaching out to the soul the bond the thread that maintains the connection of the spirit to the  prime material plane now who would like to make a contribution to the ritual  travis ill go i step up and i take my titanstone knuckles off i take the belt of  dwarvenkind off and i wrap it around the knuckles and i lay it next to scanlan and i 
none	 say  youve been with me through so much i pride  myself on my strength but as we fought  earthbreaker groon you were there by my side  as i learned that my true strength comes from my  friends which means that these trinkets no  matter how strong they are mean nothing you  knew me before then and i would hope you would  know me after while my best buddy pike taught  me to love you taught me to laugh and i dont  want to know what life is like without that 
none	 and  the last thing id say is you spent so many  times inspiring me id like to take a page from  your book and to the tune of the washington  redskins fight song  laughter around the table  i sing  singing  hail to scanlan shorthalt  hail to victory  no one can make me laugh faster  please bring him back to me  matt go ahead and make a persuasion check with advantage  travis 14  matt okay as grog steps away you watch as a portion of the circular 
none	 glyph pattern of the  ritual around you lights up the first contribution being presented  who wishes to take the next presentation  ashley i have a couple things to say but i know im already  matt okay  ashley i reach in my pocket and i pull out a little doll and  scanlan i dont know if you remember this but  you gave this to me and its a little doll of you  which is very appropriate but when i died this saved my life because you  gave it to me and i 
none	 didnt know that you had put healing words in it it saved me and i hope that  today i can return the favor  i place that next to him  i prepared a poem i dont have it memorized so hold on  here lies scanlan the bard  a gnome who sang soft but died hard  to anyone who hears us both far and wide  bring us back our dirty friend  at least one more time  he may not be tall or brute or rough  he may be little but his heart 
town	 is buff  we are a party and every party needs a clown  without our friend to reign us in well burn down your whole fucking town  all laugh  you see i love this gnome very much  hes small like me but hes touched  hes raided and slain  hes pooped while he sang  but if hes gone forever i wont be the same  now that hes learned hes a dad  the journey that all of us had  cannot be in vain  will not be in waste  please scanlan 
none	 open your eyes and see your daughters face  matt id say go ahead and make make a performance check with advantage  ashley okay  ashley okay thats good thats good  i just rolled a natural 20  matt laughs  ashley oh man okay okay  matt all right as you finish the poem you had wrote and step back the second of  the three portions of the circle comes aglow and you realize as she was speaking this poem the  chanting that she had begun has just continued without her like as the ritual 
none	 continues the  chanting seems to have been taken and echoed by the actual essence of the spell as she stepped  out of the incantation it continued on its own it continues to swell stronger and stronger at this  point as you step back theres a flash of movement at the edge of the altar and with a  double clack of her shoes you watch kaylie land her flip onto the top of the altar stand up  straight wobble for a second and catch her she pulls out her fiddle  liam wait wait wait i 
none	 just take her wrist  its no small thing to have a father who loves you  and i cast lay on hands and clear her mind of the alcohol  matt her instinct is to pull away as you grasp her wrist as it is instinctive for any man who  tries to lay a hand on her in a moment she fights the instinct and as the healing energy flows  through her arm she closes her eyes and for the first time since she arrived you watch as the  tears that she had kept at bay 
none	 blink down her cheek finally she reaches over and taps your  hand twice with her bow and still not making eye contact with you just nods and begins to play a  beautiful soft sad violin piece that begins to swell faster and faster and faster and transition  from a mournful piece of remembrance into a lively jovial fiddle piece the music begins to  pick up and she begins to dance her feet clacking across the top of the altar the  juxtaposition of the energy and the emotion of the room towards this strange rush of 
none	 energy and  liveliness is awkward at first and then welcome and you cant help but in spite of yourselves  smile the sound fills the room as she goes faster and faster and faster her feet clacking faster  and faster across the stone work on the top she brings it to a giant crescendo finishes with a  flourish the bow makes a whooshing noise outside she puts her head up and you see the  tears streak down her face no smile just a stone expression and she gives a bow  thats a performance check on 
none	 that the third and final portion of the ritual begins to swell as  the magic crescendos we take into account the final roll  im going to post this right now and i assure you guys this is what got rolled  matt as the divine energies of the ritual swell you watch as the energy shoots across stepping  into the diamond thats still on his chest you watch as the divine powers  the diamond swells with bright energy before explosion sound effect shattering into a  diamond dust across his chest across the altar clattering to 
none	 the ground like a glittering handful  of sand just tossed across his body the glyphs fade and grow cold the light of the room descends  into the same lowlit candlelight that you presented to the ritual pike a moment passes  another moment passes another moment passes and  eyes still closed you watch as a small smile curls across scanlans face  and his chest rises and falls and rises and falls  as the relief spreads throughout the room kaylie walks up  wipe that smile off your face were gonna have a talk  and 
none	 slaps his face the other way jumps off the altar slams out the two doors to the front  and staggers out of the temple into the outside  scanlan still lays unconscious but breathing  i rolled a natural fucking 20 by the way  guys on that final roll  travis did you really  ashley no way  matt its right there i havent touched it since it landed  marisha that was two natural 20s  ashley two  matt two natural 20s it was 14 for kaylies performance roll and then a 20  laura 
none	 you know  ashley holy moly  laura the fates just wanted scanlan to come back  marisha its true and he was all poopooing on the dice  laura i know  matt there wasi mean with the dc increase because he was at a 12 i missaid 13 last week it  was a 12 and we had two successes and one failure that brought it from a 13 ten to a  seven so we had a one through six and he would have been good  laura oh good  ashley  that responsibility is so scary 
none	  matt yeah anyway  as you all take in the moment it appears  that scanlans spirit has returned to the body  travis anybody wanna wake him up  taliesin no i dont think so not yet  marisha keyleth goes up and does a simple medicine check just to see whats up with him  matt go for it go ahead and roll it  marisha 18  matt okay he is alive and hes breathing his body has been ravaged by the experience and trauma  of death his body has been ravaged by the trauma 
none	 of the resurrection  he is borderline comatose right now  laura oh god  matt youve seen trauma have this impact on bodies before  it could be minutes hours days who knows  but with the right treatment usually people  recover its not like a heavy skull trauma  induced coma its just the physical exhaustion  of the experience so there may or may not be  something you could do at the moment to rouse  him from his slumber but scanlan lives  marisha i think he needs his rest  percy can we 
none	 station some of the best  sages and doctors to watch over him  taliesin we take him to the castle i suppose at this point  marisha yes  travis yeah  taliesin hell be taken care of  travis do you mind if i carry him  marisha and taliesin of course  travis i pick him up  matt okay hes warmer now  travis thats better  matt hes also drooling a little bit and may have wet himself a second time  travis thats more like it yeah thats appropriate  all laugh  matt 
none	 but hes warmer  travis everyone he may have pissed himself  all laugh  just remind him later  ashley it happens  liam the more things change  all laugh  matt all right as you guys begin to  step outside  kerrek youre there at the door after kaylie charged out kima and allura who are just waiting  outside respectfully are kind of engaged but you watch as kima immediately pushes up  is he  taliesin hell be fine  matt sighs and then scoffs and you were worried so dumb  laughs all 
none	 around  allura steps up behind her and puts her hands on kimas shoulders and goes  well thats good news take care of him well  probably return to emon and help helm the  remainder of the cleaning and situation of emon gather the dead see who we still have alive  and come back soon with an  idea of what we have to rebuild  marisha can i do an insight check  matt sure  marisha she seems worried is something wrong  marisha 26  matt 26  ashley so lootcrate  everyone laughs 
none	  laura so building huh  ashley its such a cool thing what they have this month  laura laughs  ashley you know if you love power rangers and leegos i love leegos  travis you know man these lootcrates are great  ashley cant do it like sam  matt who can though  travis if you havent got one you should  liam hey everybody scanlans still in the game  all cheer  liam badly plays a flute  all laugh  marisha do you have to leave immediately you seem tired  weve all been 
none	 through a lot you should rest a day  matt  i mean i have to rest before i can find our way back to emon quicker but the sooner the  better we did kind of leave the city in a vacuum of leadership depending on who survived the  conflict there and i want to make sure that we have whatever remains of the council there to put  the pieces back together and count the dead make sure we dont leave a vacuum of power so that  another thordaklike entity can sweep in and lead us back 
dung	 on a dark path  marisha let us know if you need our assistance  matt  i shall sighs i for one need to get clean  she taps kimas shoulders and kima says  me too  and they both walk up towards the castle what do you guys want to do  taliesin i am going to go back the castle sit down take this off  and i think sleep for a long while  marisha oh yeah what time of day is it  matt at this time the arrival here its pushing past sunset 
none	 im pretty sure or if not  its probably early night at this time with the hour for the ritual so  travis where are we dropping off the urine smelling one  taliesin well take him to his room ill make sure someone cleans him up  dresses him puts his things away  travis all right  taliesin youre welcome to take him to his room  travis i do that  ashley ill go with grog and scanlan  matt okay kerrek  patrick i probably just drift along in everyones wake at this point  matt 
town	 okay staggering behind a bit just ruminating on the current events vex you are  still back at kymal with eskil ryndarien who has come back with drinks and says  sowhat business have you here to drag me  this far out to town  laura i thought you were grabbing a room eskil arent you tired just so tired  laughter  matt well i suppose  laura we probably need our sleep right so that we can recharge  those spells of yours as soon as possible  matt i just want you to know that im 
none	 not interested  laughter  laura dryly oh are you sure darling youre so attractive to me  matt i understand that and ive had my heyday but those years are long past me now  laura well you better get to bed before i jump on you  all laugh  matt and he seems legitimately really disturbed and walks away  laura i sit down next to doctor dranzel  matt okay hes sitting hes actually half passed out now in the back corner he wasnt  there for the whole exchange with kaylie his hats pushed over 
tavern	 his eyes and he has an empty  tankard there in his one hand you dont see where his other hand is and you sit down  laura i look to see where his other hand is  matt all right you glance under the table and you come right face to face with a crossbow that  is under the table pointed in your direction and without moving you hear him grin under his chin  laughs nice try vexahlia  laura laughs just seeing what it was dear didnt want to sit on it  matt so do 
dung	 you know my coin is mine  laura as is mine  matt chuckles he puts the hat up a bit over his eyes now and you can see him  he gives you a sort a brow push  laura did you hear what i said to kaylie  matt as much as i could from a distance yeah  seems our old pal finally had his adventures catch up to him  laura how do you feel about that  matt ive had friends come and go through the years its part of the job  laura that 
none	 cant be true that cold  matt well no each one hurts but look doll ive lived in some of the harshest landscapes  taldorei and beyond has to see ive watched people torn asunder in the streets before me  i have  laura i hold onto my purse the entire time talking to him  matt okay  all laugh  taliesin that was so subtle  matt make a perception check  liam theres a lot in there  laura motherfuck  travis you know your own kind  laura 22  matt 22 you catch the 
none	 crossbow still placed there but his other hand has slipped underneath  and has been slowly reaching toward your  laura trying to cop a feel darling  matt laughs always  travis laughing he wiped a nose on his cheek  marisha so crass  matt but yeah not cold just pragmatic when you lose enough people you learn to just move on  laura yeah but scanlans special  matt hes a special pain in my ass nah hes great hell be missed  laura he will be to scanlan  matt to scanlan shorthalt and our brief 
none	 but very lucrative carrier together by the way if youre  curious were looking to sell off some of this really nice silverware that we  laura you motherfucker  travis laughs thats right its ours shit  matt he just smiles at you his big bright toothy grin  laura youre lucky that our keep was under attack and everything else got ransacked  otherwise id come after you  matt im always lucky thats why im still alive  laura well give some of your luck to scanlan im going to bed  matt all right ive got 
none	 a few more of these to put down stay safe vexahlia  laura yeah dont come to my room im serious dont  matt he looks legitimately like the wink afterward  his face has a mixed signals expression  all laugh  travis question mark  ashley dont come to my room  matt im not sure if youre serious  laura but seriously dont  matt right right no gotcha psh yes fine  besides you seem like youre already shacking up with a curious gentleman  laura sarcastically isnt he dreamy  and i head upstairs  
none	 matt strange bedfellows  all laugh  he goes and orders another round  you go ahead and find yourself up there  with two separate rooms purchased by eskil  all the way across the hall he rapidly hands  you the key and says without making eye contact  your room is at the end please yes  and finds his way you hear the door clicking sound and lock behind him  laura i stay up for a really long time waiting to hear any kind of word from allura  from anybody something  matt well 
none	 nobody told allura to contact you  laura nope they didnt  matt no  travis oh shit  laura so ill eventually go to sleep wondering if scanlans alive  marisha we werent done on our side  ashley we cant thats the earrings  taliesin technically chronologically it wouldnt have happened yet yeah  matt yeah so as she is going throughout the room and napping through the day  its taken you guys hours to prepare the ritual  bring kaylie there the whole circumstance  so yeah shes been up for a few hours waiting  
none	 the rest of you guys back at the castle anything  else you want to prep for the evening  liam in the meantime i wander over to kerrek just for a minute and i say  kerr im really terrible about lending my stuff  i forget who ive given what  and sometimes it doesnt come back  all laugh  liam could i im so sorry could i trouble you for that ring back please  patrick oh oh oh no he just takes it off he hands it back  travis aww damn it  laura 
none	 that was awesome  liam thank you thank you oh that is beautiful right back where it belongs  marisha keyleth taps vax and says  smooth nice one  liam thats me  marisha and i turn to kerrek and just give him a massive hug  thank you so much for following us into the fray literally into the pit of the  beast so thank you theres not a lot of people who would blindly follow us there  patrick it was a pleasure and it was a double pleasure to actually come out again  marisha 
none	 i dont know if would say risking your life is a pleasure but i appreciate your positive  attitude on the whole thing chuckles  patrick it was nice to have something to do again something worthwhile to do again  marisha id say you definitely spent your time wisely what do you plan to do next  patrick if you folk are heading back to the city tomorrow i should meet up with my people they  dont need me to shepherd them exactly but i should head back with them  marisha okay well thank you for everything 
none	 sincerely  i give him another hug and say goodnight and go in the castle  matt okay  ashley im going to stay with scanlan for a bit just for the night  matt okay so you take him back to his chamber  you stay next to him as hes sleeping making sure hes okay  all right everyone else just  travis im just staying outside his room  matt okay  marisha i then go i was going to go find allura and actually ask her if she had a message spell or  a sending 
none	 spell and i was totally gonna do that before  all laugh  everyone staring making the jokes about us being shitty and forgetting  because that would be awful  taliesin i was really looking forward to it to be honest  marisha to wait for 12 hours to figure out if your friend is alive or dead  all singing somewhere out there  matt yeah as you go find her shes already  in her night clothes  and has brought her hair down and is like  yes actually i can thank you for reminding me 
tavern	  marisha she must be insane right now or half drunk or both  matt probably both  marisha yeah i would be  matt i will make sure she knows  marisha okay thank you  matt of course of course sleep well youve done youve done good  marisha you too thank you  matt youve all finished what i started  marisha i think well head back with you tomorrow to emon so we can check in on our keep  once vexahila comes back of course  matt very well i can bring most of you 
none	 with me should not be an issue  all right rest well have a good night  she goes back inside  patrick kerrek will probably track down a bottle of some kind of  really strong liquor and look for grog  matt okay it doesnt take you long to find it youve seen where they keep most of it and since  youre already an esteemed guest of the keepers here of whitestone they have given you a bottle  already open but promised to have been fine quality and it doesnt take you long to hear the 
none	  various bodily functions of grog strongjaw in the hallway watching scanlans room as its  now the middle of the night close to midnight or so you come across grog alone leaning up against  the wall arms crossed just waiting outside of scanlans room  patrick and i just kind of pass the bottle over and say  well this is a better sort of vigil than what ive seen in the past  travis why that is true that could have been much what is this  patrick they seemed really impressed that they were giving it 
none	 to me  travis they gave it to you you didnt  patrick thats the extent of my knowledge it looks brownish  travis you didnt pay for it no coin you dont know if its like cheap or expensive  patrick yeah im guessing its top shelf not that i would know  travis hold on let an expert take a taste  and i take a sip  all laugh  travis do i detect any notes of stuff  matt roll an intelligence check  travis come on gil thats a three no thats a one  
none	 matt you detect notes of alcohol very strong alcohol  laura and liquid  travis yes this is clearly the finest reserve alcohol of the area  we shall enjoy this to great lengths may i  commend you on the acquisition of a great  i think i just stroked out on that word here  patrick and so i just kind of share some space  we chat a bit and then i kind of bring up that whole resurrection ritual slowly like  so that sort of thing has happened before  with you folks  travis 
none	 yeah it has unfortunately a bit too often  but i have to say before this group i didnt even know people could do that cause you  know me i cant do anything like that have you ever done one of those  patrick i no no i sighs ive looked into things like that  but ive never known anyone whos actually come back  travis really  patrick yeah  travis wait so are you saying someone coming back is rare  patrick ive i mean ive heard stories and i know but ive never seen it 
none	 myself and ive  never i dont know how much i never knew how practical any of the stories were before  travis i dont really know how pra pracsti they are either but i guess i hadnt really  thought about it much it just seems like the others in the group are responsible for it this  one was hard though i felt like it might not work you know  patrick so it always works  travis well yeah i mean of the ones ive seen  patrick and has it always been how do you need 
none	 a body  travis uh for what to stay warm at night or for a resurrection  all laugh  patrick no no for a have you ever brought someone back when you didnt have the body  travis no  patrick i expected that couldnt happen  travis oh okay cause that would be what would you use like you cant bring along like  a tea cosy and then be like bam youre back how would that even work what are you talking about  patrick exactly how would any of that work  and that is about 
none	 as subtle as kerrek can be at this point  awake for three days and two wars and a dragon thats why hes desperately trying to  pump grog for information about how the hell someone can come back  travis you picked the wrong source  all laugh  matt yeah  travis you know if you have questions the wall behind me also knows probably as much as i do  all laugh  patrick and thats like this is especially the only person i could trust to not realize that i  was trying to get information 
none	 out of him on this subject  matt yeah laughs  patrick and then when it does not when it dead ends i just drink as much of that bottle as i  can moving it back and forth between the two of us for the rest of the night  travis im good with that  ashley do i hear them at all on the other side of the door  matt you hear them muttering from across the wall but do you wanna listen in  taliesin i was actually hoping to be around the corner for a 
none	 chunk of this  cause i was heading to scanlans room as well  matt both of you guys make perception checks  ashley okay  taliesin awesome  travis so you like you take a big shiny thing and then someone starts like ayayah  taliesin 14  ashley 19  matt youre around the way  you catch the tail end of the conversation  just the questioning back and forth  you pick up bits and pieces of it and youre  able to make out the gist of the conversation  ashley okay im gonna peek 
none	 my head out the door  matt okay as you guys are finishing passing the bottle back and forth scanlans door opens and  pike just barely pushes her head out from the crack  ashley hey  travis aaah oh my god  ashley what are you drinking and why didnt you bring some to me  travis shit really good point we might be in trouble kerr  patrick i have made a terrible mistake but it is one that i can fix  and i know this is why the gods gave us two hands  i 
none	 will bring back two bottles  travis is this why the gods gave us two hands  all laugh  travis they gave us two hands for two bott pike i am so wise right now  ashley you arethat must be like an intelligence serum  travis serum did they teach you that in your sarenrae temple classes  because if not maybe you have a thing or two to teach them now  ashley probably not grog but thank you  taliesin all right now i am coming around the corner ive waited long enough  matt so 
none	 percival you hear just enough to hear the talk about needing a body and then alcohol  travis percy the gods gave you two hands for bottles for each of them  taliesin four if you can learn to use your feet  travis thats too much my brain will explode  ashley can i insight check him since i knew since i could hear what was going on  matt uh sure make it with disadvantage because it was through a wall  ashley okay  matt its hard to pick up nuances without seeing expressions and stuff  
none	 liam its just bass  matt yeah bass practically  ashley 18  matt 18 its too hard to pick up without the nuances from through a wall i mean the fact  that you could pick up any of the words is one thing but most of insight is based around facial  expressions physical activity you have no idea  travis probably some intermittent farting  matt that too yeah so you wander in kerr wandered away  taliesin i am going to wander into the room with a nod and just sit for a moment  travis 
none	 wait prove that youre you  taliesin no  travis its you  all laugh  taliesin i love you so much  matt all right so you sit for a bit kerr eventually returns  with a second bottle of matching alcohol unopened though the same  patrick  two two hands  matt oh so you go for a third bottle as well  patrick yes  matt two unopened bottles of the same brackish liquor  patrick and ill pass one to both of the people that i was not drinking with before  ill pass them off 
none	  matt okay so pike and percival you have a fresh bottle jammed into your hand  ashley one for me  taliesin ill be passing this around a bit  ashley should we all sit on the bed around scanlan like a slumber party  travis is that creepy  taliesin honestly i am thinking about going through his things so no i dont think it is  travis well okay  fart noise  matt scanlan is definitely alive  ashley oh my god what were you guys talking about out there if i can be so rude 
none	 to ask  travis oh us  patrick uh the liquor it has fabulous brackish notes  travis yep notes of brack  ashley great great  taliesin thank you we make it here  travis i was also talking about what a great job you do apparently youre really rare  ashley what do you mean  travis like like apparently you and your resurrections like they dont always work  which is amazing  ashley they dont always work  travis i didnt know that  ashley they dont weve been very fortunate weve been very fortunate  
none	 what did you why do you ask kerr  patrick ive never actually seen anything like that before it was quite an experience  am i still wearing my armor  i might actually ask that out loud  all laugh  matt and he is he is still wearing his armor unwashed a few of you have gotten washed a few  of you are still kind of you know going over the events of today grog is not washed  laura grog never washes  matt yes  travis perfume de grog  matt so yes he is 
none	 still wearing his armor  patrick you get the marvelous spectacle of a slightly older slightly portly man shrugging out  of a full suit of chainmail its entertaining  and then just like dumps it on the floor and then like the padding underneath groans  travis thats a lot of shit youre wearing man  patrick you know what i forgot over all these years like the sweat gathers in your ass  ashley swamp ass  marisha swamp ass swamp crack yeah  ashley its a thing  patrick youd think that i would remember but no 
none	 i had forgotten that  taliesin i forget and then suddenly i remember that i met you all in a prison cell  ashley i remember very well  taliesin its not fair is it  travis what  taliesin its just one day you lose so many people and then just one day you stop  and at one point in your life you decide that  suddenly for no reason theres just  youre just not allowed to die yet your life just isnt your own anymore and suddenly youve  done what you were supposed to do 
none	 and now  youre back and its just not yours anymore  is it and what of everybody else its not fair any of it i dont know  travis you dont think your life is your own  taliesin i know my life isnt my own my life is all of yours my life is my sisters  my life is this castles my life ended  ashley do you feel  taliesin im very glad to be here laughs i just miss an awful lot of people thats all  and i dont understand how we get to 
none	 choose  travis oh  ashley i understand  taliesin i know  travis whispers i just got it too  ashley whispers yeah  taliesin i know you dont grog im so grateful that you dont  to the unyielding unfairness of the universe  travis yep raising drinks  liam im not even here and ill drink to that one  marisha i know  liam fucking a  patrick ill drink  taliesin and that it decided that we get to keep this bastard hardly fair  travis what do we tell him when he wakes up 
none	  taliesin thats why i was thinking about going through all of his things  we could just leave him in a gutter somewhere  laura laughs  taliesin make him think hes reincarnated a hundred years in the future i dont know  i keep thinking of terrible things  to do to him now  marisha thats pretty funny  taliesin i know  travis i have not explored any of that and it is amazing  taliesin i well we were all troubled  i feel like once vax is awake well really  have an expert 
none	 at this sort of thing available  liam nows your chance to throw something in the acid  all laugh  taliesin i wish i could hear that  liam riegels not even here  laura oh my god  liam you could run roughshod over that motherfucker  taliesin youre not in the room youre not in the room asshole  liam this is liam talking to taliesin  taliesin i know i dont know if percy is that has that much of a lack of propriety  hes really debating though how much  have we had to 
tavern	 drink  matt well its up to you other members in this room have gotten quite drunk  marisha well the math is always how much youve had to drink versus distance it takes to travel to  your goal cause they kinda balance each other out  matt yeah  travis thats true  marisha the longer you have to go  travis if youre stationary thats one thing  marisha yeah but oh i gotta go a mile ehh half of its down stairs i dont know  ashley we could play a prank on him  taliesin 
none	 i think thats a great idea i think i need somebody with a better mind for this  travis i walk out of the room  matt grog leaves is there any other business you guys want to conduct before the evenings done  ashley did you want to go through his things  taliesin a bit that would be cruel well youre a decent person should we  ashley well i mean  patrick well what if he happens to have something on him that requires attention  ashley i actually would agree cause what if theres something you 
none	 know that he needs our  help with but feels weird about asking  patrick right or if he has if theres well i was thinking like a plant that needs watering  ashley of course  patrick except something you would have in your pocket which is not a plant  matt kerr by the way is pretty trashed at this point  liam thanks for clarifying  taliesin ive got an idea  ashley okay whats your idea  taliesin were gonna need one of your nightgowns and some of the pudding from downstairs kitchen  all laugh

none	 i think its a fabulous idea  ashley all right so ill start undressing him  matt all right so kerr you watch as percival and pike begin undressing scanlans comatose body  travis in a coma  matt and redressing it in a nightgown  laura terrible  matt and then stage by stage taking handfuls of room temperature probably dayold pudding  laura gasps  matt and desserts and smearing them across the room  laura taliesin and marisha eww  matt and scanlan himself  taliesin were gonna braid his hair as well  laura it could

town	 clouds  of billowing cinders and flame it appears that  most buildings in the immediate vicinity  while black and darkened and broken no longer  rage of burning fire the smoke has gone from  pitchblack to bits of dark grey and plumes  of white you can see already there is a bustle  throughout the city as a number of bodies are  laid out across the ground with bits of gathered  cloth placed over them those who had fallen in  the battle and are being gathered  being prepared to be brought back 
none	  to their families  marisha i immediately look to the sky  do i see any sign of the ashari and what  do the clouds look like  matt the sky is a clear cloudless crystalline blue  marisha really  matt yes  marisha okay no sign of ashari  matt no its been its been a day and a half or so since the battle happened there is no  current clouds or storm in the sky but as you do appear you see there are a number of soldiers in  patchwork armor some that 
none	 appeared to be in similar outfits as the fort daxio soldiers that  you met there during the prebattle circumstance there are few that you recognize as syngornian  armor and a few that are just people gathered what they could and have been part of the fray and  the recovery process you can see in all the turmoil and darkness and the destruction  youve seen in this city its strangely beautiful and welcoming to see that there is life thriving  again as people are returning doors are being pushed back upon the frames people are searching 
town	  for survivors behind the rubble and the various homes and finding them and youre seeing  families that are stepping out and being reunited as you begin to walk through the street you can  see essentially the hidden heartbeat of the city is reemerging once more to take back what its  lost all of you are caught speechless for a few moments and you take in this vision  and begin to walk as allura kind of leads you looking around and walks on and talks to a few  guards she glances back to you and 
none	 kind of smiles  well youve done it  and you hear a voice behind her a kind of echoing shout  kerrek  and you watch a familiar female face come rushing up in clanking armor clanking noises and she  rushes up and just socks you across the face whack  patrick this is samantha  matt this is samantha  all laugh  patrick okay  matt whered you go  patrick what  matt whatd you do  patrick what did i do  laura that mans a hero  marisha he slayed a dragon

none	 guys like to do whats your plan  travis we do have a grocery list of things that we could pick from right  laura we have a lot of stuff we need to do  marisha a ton of stuff we need to do  travis do we want to make good on that promise real fast or what  marisha which one  marisha the eighth one we have  travis the thing under the tree  laura thats in vasselheim  laura we also have a hand to deliver to marquet  marisha and a rakshasa to 
none	 kill  travis hey lets hold off on that one i think  marisha maybe we should start with checking in with home seeing how the keep is  we havent been home in a long time  travis oh greyskull  laura we were just there  marisha i guess we were just there in passing  travis were all sore right we could knock the dust off a little bit if we just did a little  delivery like some final remains into a tree or a hand or whatever  liam we just ended a threat to 
none	 civilization  i dont feel like diving into the nine hells  at the moment  marisha no  laura yeah not so much  taliesin no not really  marisha im tired  travis where is the hand going again  laura and marisha marquet  travis why  laura because we told them we would give them a hand  travis who did we promise that to  laura you know the thieves guild thing the group of assassins  travis thats boring lets go to vasselheim  marisha right now  laura shouldnt we help with making 
none	 sure the council is in place is everything solid here  matt youve been gone for a couple of days and its been moving you could ask around if you want  to try and get some information about the current circumstance  travis i guess we could do that  laura just to make sure  marisha maybe we should also check in with some of our other keep members  and see whos alive and whos dead  matt the people of your keep you brought to whitestone with you theyve been there  marisha oh thats right 
none	 i totally  matt its been a while its been a year  marisha thats right  laura how is jarett was he fine when we got back to whitestone  matt jarett is recovering  laura okay  marisha did he come back with us or is he still in whitestone  matt jaretts still in whitestone  laura hes like fuck you  matt jaretts proud and excited about the things youve accomplished but jarett needs a vacation  liam hes got to find some drugs too  matt yeah  matt hes not happy about that  
none	 travis modify memory  matt laughs if you want to roll an investigation check vex  laura 19  matt okay  laura nnnnnineteen  matt spending the next hour or so asking around from various people you dont come across any  notable allies that you recognize but the word is that the remaining bulk of the standing army of  emon and fort daxio combined with the remnants of syngorns army half went back to syngorn just  in case and the other half remained to help with the relief effort here as well as the clasp  
none	 the clasp is now bringing people theyd been  keeping underground  and hidden back to their homes back to their locations  it seems that the structure for now is focused on the relief effort  and the returning of the city to its people  as far as the actual council structure you dont  hear anything yet on that point  laura okay  matt to be fair half of the council was at whitestone  and you havent heard from any of the people that  you knew on the council who came as  part 
none	 of the battle yet what do you guys want to do  travis we dont need to check in with the clasp do we or anything  taliesin groans  laura no they kind of have their shit that theyre doing  marisha were fine right  laura were solid  liam im just going to throw this out if we leave things as they are  the clasp are going to completely ruin the city  at some point soon we might want to get  some of the council back here faster  laura well alluras here  
none	 liam thats one yeah  travis do we know where everyone else is  liam whitestone  laura well the problem is uriel was killed when the dragons attacked  nothing else was ever set in place after that  marisha thats true who was acting as  laura thordak  matt well when sovereign was slain part of his instruction was to hand power entirely over to the  council so we are still the power structure of the city its more of a localized republic we  need to enforce that structure while you take to what business 
none	 you need im going to try the best  i can to amass the remaining members of that council and install some sort of political  structure here now partly for the reason you mentioned  and partly because we dont want the military suddenly running the show either  marisha so as a quick recap he stepped down and gave this whole speech that he sees the flaws in  one ruler and wants to hand it over to a council rule  matt yeah he didnt want to be a tyrant with advisors  he wanted to have 
none	 a council that best represented the peoples interests in power  marisha right he essentially switched it from a monarchy to a republic  matt essentially yeah  marisha okay  talieisn and we have the rest of the royal family in whitestone  matt yes salda and the children are currently there  weve kept them safe and salda will most likely be placed on the council as she has quite  a bit of knowledge and experience and to keep the memory if we can recover his body or some  semblance of it i will also see 
none	 that there is a monument built to the memory of the sovereign  travis yep  liam and you think youve got a handle on getting a foothold here  matt i think if i can find one or two of my friends definitely  marisha do you need help in finding your friends  matt your strengths are best tended to elsewhere  marisha okay  matt dont worry i know mikhail is around and me and him have a good rapport and he has the  military at his back so if anything goes south or wrong i 
none	 know how to let you know so much as you  stay on this realm dont go vanishing to other planes without letting me know please  laura no feywild  matt please no  taliesin not for a bit  laura not for a bit allura before we leave  matt yes  laura will you take a look  i hand her the box of ashes that senokir gave us  do you sense any kind of aura coming off of this  or do you think it is what he said  just a box of his 
dung	 wifes ashes  matt she takes the dark box and it has small chained edges on each end  she inspects it for a moment  the box does have a very faint magical essence to it but it appears to be purely  protective im not entirely certain of anything beyond that its very faint  laura okay thank you  marisha kimas with us right  matt kimas in the process of going around and gathering information and checking in  marisha i grab vax and vex really quick and i say  hey you guys are really 
none	 good at asking people back for the stuff that we lent them  i feel a little rude doing that but you guys are good at that so  laura oh kima  marisha the boots  laura hey those boots  marisha see you guys are good at it  matt what  liam hey you know those boots you hate wearing  matt oh theyre fantastic i love them  liam oh shit  all laugh  laura its unfortunate that they look a little iffy with your armor though  just kind of can we have them 
none	 back please  liam yeah  laura we might be sneaking around you know in life or death situations  and youre going to be here with the council  marisha pike is very clanky no offense pike  ashley no none taken  liam you look like a badass gladiator in yuletide socks  matt she holds her holy avenger out in front of her and checks its blade  laura we did give you that  marisha you can keep it  matt metal scraping noise fine she bends down and kind of grunt of effort  liam 
dung	 laura and ashley eyyy  travis kima  laura those are for you man  ashley those are mine  matt shes now barefoot in full armor kind of wiggles her toes and goes  ashley i can give her the shoes that i was wearing  laura no cause you have the sprinters boots on  ashley what are they  laura you got the sprinters boots on  ashley whats she giving me  laura shes giving you the elven boots  marisha theyre like stealthy boots  laura theyre stealth boots they make you silent  ashley

none	 with you guys from the  beginning when crossing your paths she walks up and  marisha look we smoothed it over were cool now  laughter  travis in between salsa and chips there killer  matt kima walks up and places her hand on pikes shoulder  a little bit shorter than her and looks at the rest of you  youve done more than anyone ever asked you  to do done a lot of good things  for me for allie for everyone i know i can be  a pain in the ass sometimes

none	 travis what easy thing can we accomplish  taliesin i say we go to vasselheim  marisha well wait arent we going to check in with our keep  laura yeah lets walk to our keep and bamf out there  taliesin well walk to our keep  marisha if anything that means we came to emon for nothing  laura yeah pretty much  marisha except to go to our keep  taliesin we made a doublecheck  laura yeah we had to make sure everything was alright here  talisin it was a free ride  marisha thats 
none	 true  travis cool to the keep  marisha and as im walking through i keep an eye out to see if there are any ashari lingering  around but im sure theyve all bounced at this point  matt okay make a perception check  marisha alright im gonna use my druid die  oh okay just straight perception  matt yup  marisha 26  matt okay as you guys continue your way through the city and you keep an eye out you dont see  anybody with an ashari dress you do see a handful of occasional 
none	 bodies in ashari dress  marisha sure  matt and you very carefully go and inspect and while you recognise a handful  you didnt know them extremely well  marisha yeah ive been gone awhile  matt older folks you didnt connect with but thankfully not korren  marisha okay  matt but yeah there is no walking presence here of the ashari  you ask around a bit and one of the guards is like  supposed to be coming back here in a few days to gather the dead but they went ahead and chased the  
none	 rest of them wyvern riders up to the mountains think theyre still at the storm crest  marisha so the storm crest  matt probably  marisha still fighting  matt well at least picking off what they can  marisha all right thank you  marisha if you see any of them  just let them know that vox machina passed  through here and that were all still alive  matt will do  and keeps on walking  marisha any bodies that i pass by that are ashari i druidcraft little flowers and do  my own 
none	 little rituals as i walk by  matt okay you guys make your way through emon eventually the southern walls to the outside of  greyskull keep there standing still proud undamaged in the fray still holding the fresh  stonework crafted by your planar ally that you summoned quite some time ago  laura you got a remember a servant of sarenrae came down and helped us rebuild  matt yeah after the vorugal fight that destroyed  ashley oh thats right  matt  the temple but yeah the keep is  currently the front gates are open 
none	  as you walk in it looks like since you were last there there have been a few people that have  come through and looked for things  doesnt look like it were raided by thieves by any means but it looks like anything that was left in  the kitchen has been ransacked looks like tables and chairs and some bedrooms have been moved  whether they briefly held up refugees from the city who have then gone back in or people that  just moseyed through and left but the place is still currently empty  laura 
none	 eventually we do have to hire some people again  marisha yeah get this place lively again  travis i think it looks nice i mean its kind  of like a livedin look  ashley rustic  travis yeah  laura minimalistic now  marisha hire people  liam we can start to look for new hands yeah  marisha i go through and use my gust cantrip and  dust off some shelves  and straighten some paintings  matt fwoosh theres a lot of dust  laura i wonder if we should offer this up to the 
none	 city to the council to house some refugees that  havent found homes again after theyve been destroyed  marisha im fine with that  taliesin not a terrible idea at all  marisha its not like were gonna be using it any time soon  laura right  ashley its a great idea  travis we do tend to wander  taliesin well need to install the teleportation circle at some point perhaps  laura should i run back and tell allura that before we head out  marisha yeah let me check on the garden too pike do 
none	 you want to join me  ashley yes  laura ill head off on the broom and try to find allura  matt yup itll take you couple hours to get  there and hunt her down  but you do so and let her know  ashley go look at the garden and temple  marisha hows it looking  matt the blessings placed upon it and the position of sunlight  a little overgrown but flourishing  marisha wow overgrowns better than dead  matt yeah  marisha all right cool  ashley i like it a little

dung	 currently lit and the forge is dark cold there most of the tools have already  been stolen or taken anything that can be  grabbed by hand is gone  travis are there any of those dangerous buckets of water around  matt there are a couple and it smells of stale hard water  travis treacherous  all laugh  travis dont really know what im looking for are there any like powders like sacks of powder  matt make an investigation check  travis crates of powder or oh thats not terrible 14  matt you do 
dung	 find what looks to be a small brown wooden barreltype container it has a lid on  it but its easy to pull off and on the inside it has a familiar smell that you catch whenever  you see percy fiddling with his weapons sort of a dark powder substance  travis can i pour a little out  matt yup looks like soot or charcoal dust grainy like sand  liam can i have snuck down and be watching this  matt make a perception check  liam thats pretty high that is a 30  matt yeah 
none	 you totally saw grog just stomp down into the lower area so you can go ahead and  liam thanks  travis hm no fire dangerous water no weapons  all laugh  matt does not appear to be any weapons in the room  there are the racks where tools are usually hung on that you remember but theyre all gone  travis shit  matt theres just nubs out of the wall  travis all right i turn around and i leave  matt okay  liam oh  travis hi  liam hey  travis oh

dung	 your hands grog but  hes a perceptive guy and there is indeed a very dark familiar residual  marisha powder  matt on the hands forearms and a little bit on the top of the cheek  taliesin good to know  liam laughs its like an eightyearold with chocolate across his face  all laugh  matt kinda  ashley i didnt get into it  marisha i didnt eat any  travis no unnecessary fights  marisha no unnecessary fights  taliesin no  marisha okay  travis yup  marisha all right  liam i mean 
none	 the crucible is there  marisha well thats not unnecessary  ashley wait he said we cant open the box  right or did he say  laura he didnt say not to  taliesin seems a bit disrespectful  laura he said it was his wifes ashes after all  ashley i know okay  travis why would you want to  do you not like  laura do you not trust it  ashley no i just wanna know for sure  marisha didnt we kinda look before we thought the same thing and its  laura did 
none	 we look though did we look  matt i dont recall you looking in  marisha but didnt we do an insight check and  laura and i mean i had allura look at the box  marisha right  laura she said it had a faint magical aura of protection  marisha but it was protection  liam could you shake it like a yuletide present  laura no  liam no  ashley maybe its actually somebody requesting that we do something that is nice then  which i feel like never happens  all laughs  marisha 
none	 from what i remember from my i can look right  ashley i dont trust anybody anymore  marisha from senokir cause didnt i do  an insight check  matt yup  taliesin i would love the notion that the one time that we actually follow through with this  very simple and basic thing that we aim to do and just everything goes to shit  marisha we plant a seed of a demon spawn  taliesin really lovely very us  taliesin this time everybody goes to shit because its the one  purely altruistic thing that 
none	 we do  marisha okay hang on hang on  taliesin my god your notes  marisha give me a second  taliesin no these are amazing  marisha his wifes name was zofin  laura playing with those dice are you  matt im just turning dice over and over again in my dice pile  marisha senokirs wife was zofin  matt zaafin  marisha zaafin  ashley zofah  liam so fine  travis why dont you check it  laura so fiiine  marisha nope thats all i got  laura if you want to do 
none	 it just do it  marisha i feel like i remember  travis its your say go for it  taliesin i think we should make a tree  and head in that direction  marisha well we already have a tree but yeah  taliesin all in favor of jumping through that tree  marisha make like a leaf and wait make like a tree and leave laughs  laura yeah  travis i dont know ask him  ashley was the box already checked for traps  matt you dont know  ashley can i check it for 
none	 traps  matt make an investigation check  ashley okay  travis do what you want man  laura should we scoot this forward a little bit  matt as you guys are walking up heading your way up into the temple area with the singular tree  used for transportation before pike is just holding and inspecting the box as you walk  ashley i got an eight  laura whatre you doing pike  matt eight its hard to tell looks pretty safe  laura do you not trust it  ashley i just dont trust anybody anymore 
none	  travis man i know what thats like  ashley okay im not good at okay lets go  matt all right  ashley lets go  liam whats on your mind  ashley i just feel like this is something  fishy about it  it just seems too easy you know  laura too simple for us  ashley too simple  ashley to just take a box and go bury it why couldnt he do it  i know we already talked about this  marisha well wasnt he kind of stuck in the fire plane  
none	 travis yeah hes not allowed  marisha yeah  ashley all right  laura hes not hes not allowed i dont remember him saying that  travis i might have made that up  all laugh  matt he said he had been intending to make a trip to vasselheim to bury it himself  but he hasnt had the time or the ability to do so  laura seems odd right i mean it is his wifes ashes  marisha oh man you guys i thought this was something sweet  and we werent gonna question it and now 
none	 were making it complicated  travis youre right yeah  travis youre right were thinking too much  liam are we saying theres no one in the world  whos truthful at all  marisha i dont know anymore were all too scarred and damaged  laura some people are truthful but i mean  senokir did wanna make us his slaves  marisha we were all on board for this until 20 seconds ago when we started questioning it  all laugh  ashley im sorry i just sighs  laura pike could be saving our lives right now 
none	  travis yeah  ashley or i could be killing all of us  liam well the bottom line is hes probably never gonna know if we take a peek  ashley what if i just take a peek  marisha vax  travis oh wait thats a good idea  ashley or like open it to a mirror  laura ooh  marisha are we taking a peek  marisha or never doing it  travis i mean she is quite holy right  like if anyone was gonna look on those sacred remains least it would be old 
none	 stinker here  laura i mean it does have a magical aura of protection so it might be  ashley it might hurt me  marisha it might backfire  liam im not gonna open it can i look at it can i look for locks or traps  im not opening it  matt look for traps  liam yeah oooh that is a 22  matt 22 it is not trapped  liam and i dont know if its locked  matt well go ahead and make a roll  to see if its locked  liam ooh 
none	  laura laughs  liam thats even better thats a 30  matt 30 it is locked there are four individual locks in each side  liam four locks  matt and it appears that there is some sort  of a usually when something like that has a  little bit of give against the chain the box has none  that usually either means its adhered or its sealed magically  liam pickle i will help you if you want  but my gut is telling me that this is  just his wifes ashes  ashley shake 
none	 it listen  travis i second that  matt make a perception check  laura i put my hands up and walk a little bit away  liam 30 again  matt you hear what sounds like the very gentle sifting of  some very very light particles inside of a box  liam yeah yeah i think hes telling us the truth  marisha vax the raven queen is like your girl  liam yeah  marisha can you maybe like there is remains in here  laura can you both just ask you know  travis yeah like 
none	 yo is this the dead or  marisha pike youre a cleric if youre that concerned man this is so extravagant you guys  taliesin how paranoid has everybody gotten  liam im gonna use my paladin powers theres nothing undead in there is there  ashley divine intervention  taliesin wow  matt okay so youre using your  liam divine sense yeah  matt divine sense you do not get a fiendish or undead aura from the box  liam yeah man this is just the guys wife  ashley what if we bury it and it turns 
none	 into something crazy  travis what have you been reading  ashley i dont know  marisha when he told us it was his wife we all went  awww when that happened and now were questioning it  ashley but thats what a shyster does you know  liam youre so hardened by the war  ashley they tell you things to make you feel bad to buy their magazines  all laugh  ashley you know  taliesin this is getting weirdly personal  marisha who is trying to sell you magazine subscriptions who  ashley just everyone 
none	  taliesin what high schooler hurt you  laura we just fought raishan i dont blame this  liam pickle pickle pickle  ashley everyone in whitestone you guys havent been there long enough  liam pickle pickle  ashley yes  liam there is a fucking tigerfaced demon who wants both you and i dead  we have bigger problems than this mans wifes ashes  marisha pike we have to sail the ocean  taliesin people havent sold you a subscription to highlights  ashley i know all right lets go bury the you know  liam but 
none	 you carry it  ashley ill carry it  all laugh  ashley i pop it under my arm lets go  matt okay  marisha i just wanna let you know i feel you  ashley okay  marisha but im trying to make this our first step into being a more positive vox machina  ashley okay  travis whats wrong with your face  marisha this is me forcing a smile  travis oh  marisha theres pain under here thats why it looks like that  travis right  laura youre not supposed to say all 
none	 those things  marisha sorry oh right im supposed to hide behind and bottle those emotions  laura yeah  marisha right no things are great  laura thats good thats good thats good  marisha yeah thats how normal people talk right things are great  travis we just bury it in the tree thats it in the tree  ashley no we got her name right  marisha yes  ashley so well make her a little tombstone well do a whole thing then  laura yeah  liam well do a whole thing well bury the ashes 
none	  ashley were gonna make it nice  taliesin i am genuinely worried about everybody  ashley put grasping vines all over it  travis badabing badabam  matt the conclave arc has taken its toll on vox machina  all laugh  marisha were all huddled around a box just like freaking out right now  liam vex just draws on that box  travis one little fucking box reveal your secrets  matt so keyleth  marisha all right lets go  ashley lets go  matt okay so what are you connecting to  marisha huh what 
none	  taliesin the other side of the tree  matt the other side of the tree where are you sending you have many options at your disposal  you have the outskirts of the city theres the lush forest the vesper timberland  marisha he told us where to bury her right  matt he said the abundant terrace which you have passed by  marisha i have passed by  matt yeah  laura we should stick to the outside of the city right because of the magical laws there  matt well the abundant terrace is a very 
town	 heavily wooded area  marisha on the outskirts  matt and the magical laws are more about rampant arcane casting  divination and divine magics generally fall more into the territory of respect  as long as theyre relatively controlled and not a grand display of power  laura solid  marisha so the abundant terrace is a forest on the outskirts of the town  matt the abundant terrace is meloras section of the city  laura melora  marisha oh right right right  matt its where its a district that has maintained magical fertility for growing crops 
none	 and  plants and its basically where a lot of the food for vasselheim is grown  marisha oh perfect farming district okay is there a tree there  matt there are a number of trees actually a number of the homes are actually built in  marisha in trees thats cool  liam sick  marisha i want a tree house okay  and you said its safe this isnt arcane  its natural since melora ill probably be okay  people arent gonna look at us weird when we come out of a tree on the other end 
none	  matt i mean when you come out of a tree people probably look at you weird anyway  marisha sure  ashley do people bury their dead here  matt you dont know roll a history check  laura but didnt he say that she was from this area  taliesin ill join in this history check this is bothering me  marisha sofine sofin  matt zaafin  laura and marisha zaafin  laura zaafin was from this area  matt apparently yes this was where she came from  ashley we both did a history check 15 
none	  taliesin 26  ashley well there you go  matt okay i mean usually the dead are interred in specific graveyards  some people do prefer to have their ashes spread  in places that were important to them its just a  general request but the birth heart or the  abundant terrace are not areas that are  designated for interring the dead so  it is a special request  laura okay i have a thought  travis oh no  laura what if we do bury this where hes asked  but we put it 
none	 inside of something that deters magic  travis and liam like what  laura i dont know like a fine container or something it was just a thought isnt there  things like that like a chest or something that dispels magic so that if he is trying to do  something nefarious then we keep him from doing that  liam you want to go find an arcane shop  ashley like a container store  liam  find a very expensive container  travis this seems really out of the way for what is a simple burial  
none	 taliesin how about we just ask a few questions to see if anyone remembers his wife  laura good call  travis hey yes  laura i like it  taliesin maybe she left some sort of connection to this place  laura could you cast speak with the dead on ashes  travis oh my god  taliesin yes but they just say shkshkshkshk  all laugh  marisha thats probably true  travis like baby powder  liam we saved the world but we are still a bunch of assholes  matt a corpse still requires a mouth 
none	 to speak  travis lets get over there  marisha laughs we saved the world but were still a bunch of assholes  matt it doesnt work all right so keyleth what  travis the wondrous sand doesnt come up  marisha what am i doing  matt are you going to come popping out within the city abundant terrace  laura abundant terrace  ashley yeah abundant terrace  marisha abundant terrace ho  matt all right  ashley well decide when we get there  matt the tree laughs  marisha well have six seconds to think about 
none	 it  laura be an idiot  matt the tree shreds open into the familiar oval or diamondshaped entryway on the opposite side  you see the cold landscape or at least the cold sky of vasselheim though surrounding you it is  just verdant green you can see moss and bushes and grass and a number of tree trunks around you  you can see a very clearcut path that walks through like an intentional park walkway as you  all emerge you find yourself looking up into the relatively grey heavily cloudcovered sky and it  is very 
none	 cold you watch as very very faint snow drifts to the ground but it doesnt touch it  immediately evaporates before it hits the ground it seems either the warmth of the area or an  enchantment of some kind is resistant to the weather of this northern continent  marisha can i do a quick nature check to see if this is a mystical realm  or if theyve done something naturey to make it  matt nature check  marisha 22  matt 22 the snow would usually touch the ground and then slowly turn to water and 
none	 melt if it was  just a difference between the ground however the snow never reaches within a foot it just kind of  drifts and then poof so it does appear to be an enchantment or some sort of magical essence to the  abundant terrace itself but you are surrounded by a forest that has very beautifully kept walkways  in a gridtype pattern you do see some people that are walking through a couple handinhand  almost like theyre just on a stroll bunched furs around their shoulders you can see a little ways  down the 
none	 trees stop and it opens up into what looks to be an expanse of farmland rows and rows  and rows of various crops that are perpetually being planted pulled up and harvested there is  no harvest season in vasselheim because of the enchantment of the abundant terrace  it is perpetually fertile and bearing  travis thats awesome  laura wow  matt you havent done a full pass of this area but its not densely populated  what people come here either are working the  land keeping the land or are enjoying the  change in 
none	 scenery from the rest of what can  be sometimes a more i guess you would say  grey and expressionless landscape that some  parts of the city tend to hold  but here you are at the abundant terrace  what do you want to do  marisha i remember he said he wanted us to plant the box under a tree  matt he said to bury it beneath the birth heart in the abundant terrace  marisha the birth heart  liam that is not a random tree  laura is that couple pretty close  
dung	 matt yeah they kinda walk by and look over they both appear to be human the woman with darker  hair its braided and pulled around to one side the mans a little older dark beard that kinda  goes to grey around the mustache and the chin dark hair thats slicked back and its kinda long  in the back both have their furs around their shoulders and she has her arm around his arm and  they just walk past and glance back at you with a huh they just walked out of a tree  ashley hello 
town	  marisha hi  matt hello  ashley do you do you guys live here or are you just passing through or checking out the town  matt we live in the quad roads were just out here for a walk  ashley beautiful place do you do you happen to know or knew of someone named uh zaafin  matt zaafin  he turns to his companion she looks up  no i dont recall anyone named zaafin im sorry  i do not either my apologies good day  they awkwardly continue walking  marisha ask them where 
none	 the birth heart tree is  ashley do you know where the birth heart tree is actually  matt she stops and turns back  the birth heart is two paths up and to  the right its hard to miss  ashley how long have you guys lived here  matt they kinda look at each other back at you awkwardly  my entire life she lived up north in crossin but moved here ten years ago  ashley and youve never heard of a zaafin  matt no  ashley insight check  matt yes make an insight 
none	 check  ashley 24  matt 24  ashley i get a whisper  marisha whispers  taliesin if you wanna help build tension  lootcrate will help you build a lot of things today oh stop it  marisha with their next theme  taliesin and marisha build  taliesin build suspense build character  marisha build tension build stress  laura do you feel powerful when you go yeah  marisha yes build anxiety disorders  laura did you just hijack her twitter  liam no  taliesin laughs sorry shit  matt well done  ashley thank 
none	 you thank you very much for stopping and talking with us  matt of course  and they continue their path quicken their pace  a bit hoping to avoid any future questions  ashley they have no idea who she is they just wanted to be on their way  travis why is it called the birth heart tree  marisha i guess well find out they said we couldnt miss it  travis all right lets go find it  marisha all right  matt all right you follow their instructions which involves you guys  now following 
none	 them about 40 feet back and they notice you  marisha were trying to do that thing where its not like  youre walking to your car after youve already said goodbye  matt okay so you hold back a bit  marisha yeah  matt they eventually turn the opposite direction following instructions you go up two paths and to  the right and you can see now amongst what is a fair number of id say 20foottall trees that  youve come across in this area there is a large domed cluster of trees almost like a redwood 
none	  forest dome of 100foottall trees this one it looks like lothlorien in the distance  you have regular forest and this giant bump in  the canopy  and you get the sense thats probably the birth heart  laura does it kind of remind us of sondurs tree  matt sondur was a singular tree  this from what you can tell appears  to be a cluster of many trees  laura okay  travis do we proceed towards it  marisha yeah we do  liam yes yes  matt all right you guys push on 
none	 and as you approach  travis can we keep an eye out for guards anybody that might be watching us  matt okay make a perception check  travis me  matt yes you he who asks  travis he who asks rolls a ten  matt okay as you walk you see a handful of guards that just occasionally wander through  the bastions wear patchwork armor there isnt a standard bastion armor set per se but they do  have elements of colors and cloths that symbolize their station as well as some pins or badges that  
none	 mark the symbol there so you do pick up on a few of them and theyre just kind of doing the  rounds and there are a couple that are curiously keeping their distance and keeping an eye  but not following you just hm  travis bidet  matt bidet  laura can i keep an eye out for any kind of tombstones or  anything in the area that looks like anybody else might have done similar things  matt sure perception check  laura oh is it at advantage because were in a forest  matt defeated 
none	 technically yes  taliesin that was the saddest advantage ive ever seen  laura perception you said  matt yes  laura thats a 20  matt okay as you walk towards the birth heart and you get towards the outside of this large  cluster of towering trees you do not see anything that would be a tombstone per se  occasionally you do see a cluster of stones  laura can i check em out and see if it looks like  matt yeah make an investigation check  laura what  travis whys your binder closed  
none	 laura well im trying to take up less space cause we you know what was the first one  liam eight they were both dogshit  laura 15  matt 15 okay  laura shut up  matt looking at the rocks that are here there are not a lot of errant stones here  some occasional natural stones but there is a  thick kind of naturally composting pine and  leaves that fall on this area that regenerate the  cycle of fertility here as part of the  enchantment these stones are deliberately  placed and are 
none	 placed in a circular pattern  with a pile in the center it does appear to be  a marking of some kind  laura all right  travis whats that  laura i dont know it looks like it could be a marker  a tombstone memorial something like that  travis do we have to make one that looks like that  laura we could  travis okay  liam is it in the exact center of this big area of the trees  matt youre unable to see from this perspective you dont have an aerial view 
none	  liam oh all right but i mean is it deep in or is it just as we come in  matt its not terribly deep if you guys have reached the outside of the birth heart youve  been walking for maybe ten minutes its not youre not entirely certain how far you are from  the outskirts of the abundant terrace you havent really walked through it before youve seen it  from a distance keyleth did one pass on it when you first came to vasselheim for the second time  you really have no idea where 
none	 you are within the city  liam do i get a vibe off of it like its a place where others have been buried before  matt make a wisdom check  liam ill use luck  laura thats cocked thats cocked  liam sure  matt nope  liam all right it was a tiny bit eight  matt if you can read the number its not  laura okay  liam what does it say  matt yeah you get the sense i mean its aweinspiring to be in this giant canopy of trees  its hard to 
none	 tell from this distance but its probably hundreds of feet across from end to end  and its beautiful there is once again you can see trees up on the mountain that vasselheim is  built on the base of and you can see distant clusters of pine that are all covered in snow  there should be snowfall on these trees to a certain extent ice gathering at some point in the  boughs and it is just verdant green untouched by frost or snow  marisha does there seem to be one central tree in the center of 
none	 all this or just a massive  matt its hard to tell from this outside youd have to walk into the birth heart to see  laura lets do it  marisha yeah yeah yeah i thought we already were doing that  matt as you enter the birth heart its an archway of branches and trees that knit into each  other and wrap around as you step in you can see what looks like a heavy cluster of forest is  really just an outside row of trees that are all intertwined the inside is open with the 
none	  occasional stalk of tree that blossoms up into the higher portion  there is one large central tree in the center of the area that marks  marisha the birth heart  matt this is the center of the birth heart  and within there are a number of lanterns  that are hung from the branches all throughout  laura its beautiful  matt   that all have their own yellowish fairy glow within each point  theyre all through the inside at different levels  marisha shut up dont judge us  matt its just hundreds and 
none	 hundreds of these yellow glowing lights that are hooked up into the  boughs ahead there are a number of people walking off the path just through the soft mulch wood and  dying pine soft floor of the canopy all wearing similar robes of greens and yellows golds and  whites you recognize these as similar signs of followers priests  marisha of melora  matt  and people who are worshipers of melora  marisha oh shit all right  matt the central tree does have a number of staircases that spiral up at certain points there  
none	 look to be windows and holes throughout the inside gives a warm glow from the interior and you  can already see dozens of people gathered around the outside at tables talking  travis whispering its a cafe  matt laughs theres no cafe necessarily  all laugh  liam but there is a gift shop  marisha theres a starbucks  matt but there is a surprisingly i wont say vibrant social atmosphere but there are places  where people are congregating here to have soft conversations  laura are they all holy or is this like  matt 
none	 some of them are some of them arent  laura okay  matt its a smattering of individuals  laura  this is beautiful  marisha i know this is so romantical  travis mimics throwing up  marisha i go up to one of the worshipers of melora  matt okay there is an older woman her hair starts red and goes to grey best you can tell  her heritage is human but she is a little thicker and more muscular than most women of her age that  youve come across her skin is weathered from sunlight and 
none	 harsh seasons but she smiles as you  approach and her eyes one looks to be a little cataractridden but the other one is a beautiful  clear blue color and both of them meet with yours as you approach and she smiles  ah can i help you  marisha oh hello i am keyleth of the air ashari whats your name  matt lamor its nice to meet you  marisha lamor pleasure to meet you i was just curious lamor  matt yes lamor  marisha i want to write this down before i forget  matt 
none	 l a m o r  marisha uh what  matt l a m o r  marisha l a m o r okay i was just curious we are here to pay our respects and to do a favor for  a friend and bury his fallen wife is there a specific place where we can do that and spread the  ashes in a respectful manner below the birth heart tree i just dont want disturb the grounds  matt i mean to return to the earth is a sacred offering from what you were given life is 
none	 to give  life once more you would need a witness i could witness for you if youd prefer  marisha really  matt just to make sure that theres no funny business of course  marisha of course i have no problems with that  laura no  marisha no problems with that  taliesin i think its a great idea  laura solid  matt um find a place of your choosing i will come as well  marisha thank you do you have any suggestions kind of new to this  laura anything with orange flowers around 
none	 i feel like senokir would like orange flowers  matt not much in the way of blooming flowers of color in the birth heart  ashley is it better to open a box and put the ashes out or is it  matt that depends on the interred  i mean whatever the wishes are of the  one youve lost but thats  travis should we ask if maybe she knows her the name  laura oh yeah did you happen to know a woman named zaa zaafin  laughter  laura i literally was thinking so fine in 
none	 my head and i was trying to remember  matt im afraid i dont know that name im sorry  laura she was a big fan of this place  marisha one of her favorite locations  matt thats very sweet  marisha yeah okay well i think we would just  like to bury the box without disturbing the box right guys  laura probably  travis yeah just put the box in there  marisha okay  liam yes  laura probably  matt laughs shes looking a little awkward from all this conversation  laura weve never 
none	 buried ashes before  taliesin weve had a very long week  marisha yes  matt you do look a bit worse for wear  liam a couple of months actually  matt well decide on a location of your choosing  we will have to keep vigil over it for a short time  laura great thats wonderful  marisha thats great yes  taliesin excellent  matt if there is anything found that is not approved within the birth heart  it will be excised and removed from  the premises  marisha great  matt no disrespect 
none	 meant  laura clicks her tongue none taken  travis question what sort of thing would represent an unwelcome burial  matt anything thats not the remains of an individual like youve promised they are  travis oh right yeah like foreign seeds or something  matt very much so  travis agriculture control very important  laura bad bad very bad  liam there are flowers here arent there  matt i mean simple wildflowers yes  liam lead the way please whatever is closest  matt all right  liam thank you  matt all right follow me 
none	  she turns around and she looks not  mistrusting but definitely a little confused  she brings you to the edge of this pathway  and you can see there is a nice smoothpacked  dirt walk thats well kept and you can see  occasionally a few of the priests come through  with these very fine rakelike brooms that  they pull through like a very fine zen garden and  it rakes the earth as they go through and it helps then pack it as they walk  liam as we walked over here i turned 
none	 around to the group and went  all laugh  matt she brings you to the edge where the dirt ends and you can see the underbrush and greenery  continues she steps into it and you watch as each foot comes down as you would when you walk  through a densely wooded area with each crush of a plant or a brush or a stick or twig as it  breaks it mends itself immediately after she steps past it she leads you maybe 70 feet off the  path past a couple of the central trees that 
none	 are dappled throughout this area in one spot you can  see these faint whitishgrey flowers that are  gathering in clusters around the base of a tree here  laura thats nice  liam  this looks perfect  matt well it is yours to do  laura does the birth heart have healing properties  matt the birth heart has many properties the guiding and blessings of melora are strongest here  than anywhere on exandria and here her presence is felt even beyond the divine gate  liam pike this feels right  laura right  ashley it 
none	 does  liam yes it does  laura does it  marisha okay look i feel like this is an exercise in simplicity for us and trust right  laura yeah  marisha right  travis sorry for all the questions its very lovely here  matt thank you  marisha its not you its us  laura were so weird  marisha sighs we really are  matt i wasnt going to say it but im glad you brought it up  liam pike would you bring the box over here please would you pray with me please  
none	 ashley well i matt can i ask you a question  all laugh  matt yeah yes you may ashley  travis holy shit  laura that got serious  travis oh legit  ashley is it respectful to  liam spike the box  ashley  when youre at a place of another gods worship to  i know we did at the resurrection ritual but to bring another god into it  matt roll a religion check  ashley oh fuck it do i get advantage  matt no you have no idea  ashley i have no 
none	 idea  matt youve spent some time in vasselheim but its always been focused around your temple and  the reconstruction of sarenraes temple you have spent very little time studying the other  religions around you and what that sort of situation would entail so you have no clue  marisha wait did you say something about a resurrection you didnt say that did you  ashley i was just saying cause  travis the resurrection was both the raven queen and  ashley was in the raven queen but we were using sarenrae as well  matt yeah 
none	 so the crossing over of the deities influence  in the space is what she was inquiring about  marisha right  laura some deities might like each other more than other deities though  taliesin thats very true actually  liam ours are cool though  marisha yeah totally  liam ours are  laura like besties  liam ours are besties  ashley i feel like melora and sarenrae  marisha they might be chummy  taliesin or so similar that it might be a problem  liam yeah  marisha well  travis this is kind of 
none	 her spot  liam makes sense on the surface  taliesin its just theres a lot of clash  marisha well meloras more neutral shes more nature is  travis earth tone  marisha earth tones you know fall colors  liam i know that were all really fucking worn out  but i would like to not cheapen this moment any more than we maybe already have  marisha guys when we set out to do this we promised we were going to make this easy and  simple and we cant even do that we are torturing ourselves 
none	 we are  travis youre youre getting a little  marisha  making this far more complicated  laura whoa lets stop lets stop lets just  marisha okay  laura  bury these ashes  ashley percy  taliesin im keeping my mouth so shut  marisha okay look all right pike if you want before we do this i could do a commune with  nature and maybe study the lands and see if i could maybe connect with melora  maybe through my spire if you want  travis put the box in the ground  marisha 
none	 okay or we could just put the box in the ground jesus  ashley all right well are we going to dig a hole or we just  laura is it all right if we dig a hole  matt i imagine so yes  laura all right  matt all right  so you get down to dig a hole  laura sure  matt its soft the ground is pretty malleable actually  not like clay but the dirt isnt densely packed in this portion  laura as im doing it im like  melora you were clutch 
none	 in the fight against  raishan and we appreciate it greatly  thank you for everything youve done for us your trees are beautiful  matt laughs  ashley so we dont know what were planting here  so if its something bad its not our fault  all laugh  ashley side note  laura are you talking to the dirt  ashley im talking to melora through the dirt  marisha you just put like a  we are not responsible for any damages clause into the contract  liam um i am smirking but trying to pray 
none	 to the raven queen  matt okay you place the box in  ashley augh yes  matt okay  laura laughs  matt you rest you rest the box down  ashley my precious  all laugh  ashley it doesnt feel right  travis like gollum why should i  matt  into the hole freshly dug by vex  laura im gonna cover it its getting covered  matt vex covers it takes the dirt pats it pats down there the flowers arranged naturally  across the tree trunk and the growth surrounding it the woman clasps 
none	 her hands together  very well now if you please  marisha would it be okay if i just picked a couple flowers  to press and take with me for remembrance  matt she reaches over and click noises  there you are child  marisha thank you  matt now um business is done  laura could we leave a marker of some sort so we know exactly where we left her  matt what would you wish to leave  laura i saw earlier circles of stones is that traditional  matt depends on your background of 
none	 course if thats what you prefer  we wish nothing with names or engravings the  memory is kept by melora and the presence  of nature in its own so a marker or  laura can you think of anything senokir wouldve appreciated  taliesin i think knowing his work is underground may be enough  marisha i could stone shape something simple  laura maybe a ring hes a jeweler  marisha thats true  laura it was his wife  marisha thats true i out of the ground stone shape  what looks like a simplistic fire 
none	 branded wedding band  matt you watch as the earth off to the side of where you buried the box shakes and a single  stone roughly that big shaking ground sounds finds its way to the surface like a localized  earthquake and as it hits the top it cracks splits and shapes into a circular band and then  falls on the side and rests there for a moment on top of the dirt pile  laura thats perfect  liam thats cool  marisha okay lets out a deep breath  travis thank you for um this 
none	  matt i will remain vigil over this  you may take your walk up the birth  heart or the rest of vasselheim  laura oh thank you  taliesin thank you  laura can we go in can we go up and look or is it like  matt well you would have to speak with the priests its not necessarily an open  travis its not the swiss family robinson tree house  laura its just beautiful i dont think ive ever seen  marisha who are the priests  matt any of the individuals in similar 
none	 garb but  they have a series of golden rings around their neck at the base of the tree  marisha i was just curious because you see i have this staff that has meloras marking on it  matt she takes a moment reaches for it gasps  marisha wow thats  laura we shouldve led with that  marisha you know thats quite a reaction i wasnt expecting that  matt this where did you how where did you come across such an artifact  marisha i found it through a series of very hard and troubling events 
none	 and circumstances  taliesin laughs  matt i can only understand that what you hold in your hand is one of the great relics of melora  marisha okay  matt i must remain as ive chosen my vigil already  but if you would do the honor of the birth heart of having that returned to the  priestesses of melora that would be of a great aid to our people  marisha inhales sharply  all laugh  liam he just did that  marisha laughing fuck you travis  taliesin woooow  laura through her bottle thats 
none	 why you keep things hidden  matt its  and she reaches out and runs her finger along the side and is like  marisha yeah okay you know thats enough thats enough touching  matt a magic a force as potent in that youre blessed to have found it  laura shes aided us greatly  matt as she does us all  marisha what if her aid clears throat what if her aid was best used  laura protecting the world  marisha  in the world and not maybe in a museum  matt that is your 
dung	 choice not mine  taliesin i think perhaps there will come a time  but that it is not yet time to put the staff to rest  marisha look sighs painfully  travis wow just walk away walk away  marisha you know i dont want to hold on to anything if it doesnt rightfully belong to me  but this has also been lost for a long time so who does it rightfully belong to  and im trying to do good with it  matt shushes she reaches out and touches your forehead  marisha okay i 
none	 just i dont wanna  matt its all right we mean not to take it from you  marisha uhhuh  matt if it still has purpose in your hands keep it keep it safe do not lose it as you say it was  once lost and when you find the need for such power no longer necessary then return it  marisha i promise you i will  and im very grateful and i do feel very blessed  that i found it and that i have this power  matt then use it to spread her love 
none	 use it to spread her comfort and protection  laura champion of melora i see it now  marisha you know sighs  travis oh shit  marisha is there a way cause you see im not great with the gods but ive never really spoken  to melora i have a lot of friends who are very much supporters of her  is there something i could do to show my thanks  matt i think that the fact that you still hold that to this day means that her favor smiles on  you if you walk the

town	 forges you head that direction following that as a very definitive visual reference point it takes  you the better part of an hour or so making your way through the crowds the bastions and it seems  like not a whole lot has changed since last time you were in vasselheim for all the chaos and  destruction you have seen in taldorei it appears that isilra is none the wiser and life goes on  laura wow  matt you make your way through the braving grounds to the trial forge and there you see  before you 
dung	 the large temple of kord the dark deep red rusted iron color of the temple with the  statue on top the front doors the tall thin doors are open just enough for about two  shoulderswidth of people to walk through the interior appears to be brightly lit  travis do you want to go inside only the strong may enter  ashley yeah ill go with you  travis all right i would like to go inside  matt all right  laura should we wait out here for you  travis meh you can come in if

dung	  portions of the archway meeting in the center just over and over again like this oversized  spinal column almost in the way that its segmented eventually coming to where the center  points cross where the sand pit you recall the center of the trial forge was as you approach  you see a singular figure standing in the center of the pit facing away from you  travis blows out a slow breath  matt you see the same dark deep ruddy color and weathertexture of the shoulder muscles and arms  resting at the side the 
none	 same grayishwhite hair pulling down the back of the baldontop head the  reds and golds of the billowing pants there before you and as you approach quietly towards the edge  of the sand pit the voice shouts out  i have had visions in my rest of your path to  war strongjaw you took my words and you  found your strength what have you learned  travis that without my friends and love my strength would be nothing  matt then show me what you have learned  laura oh shit  matt show me what
