town	 having heard that  the briarwoods a couple who had taken power in the town of whitestone far to the northeast  apparently responsible for the destruction of percys entire family and his escape into the  wilds of taldorei were going to be coming to emon to bridge a political handshake with  sovereign uriel and all of taldorei proper to build a bridge across the channel that separates  this continent from wildemount across the sea  upon hearing this the party was planning to gather information and in doing so vax got  himself caught by sneaking 
none	 into their bedroom and was nearly killed in the process the group  managed to aid him pull him out from the jaws of death and the briarwoods escaped through arcane  means leaving a shattered carriage a mostly beaten driver of their carriage through the  scuffle a number of guards were hurt or killed and the party upon meeting an individual named  lilith a tiefling leading her back to the keep they were attacked or seemingly attacked by a  series of bounty hunters that were after her there was some intense violence displayed against  a 
none	 few of them and this all got back to the council the council called vox machina to the  central palace and began a trial to see if they were responsible for attacking guests of the  council ruining what couldve been a very lucrative union between the two towns and possibly  murdering an old woman they had their membership revoked and during this sequence apparently the  charmed seeker asum was restored seemingly to little effect  the group then left realizing that perhaps the moral ramifications of their actions are having a  bigger impact due to 
none	 their visibility and their heroic status in the kingdom at large when they  returned to the keep they found two representatives of the northern farmers of emon  that required aid their livestock had been stolen over the past few weeks and was putting them in  dire straits when it came to the necessary amount of meat they had to raise the group trying to  turn their morality on its head decided to aid waited out in the center of the cow pasture at  night masquerading through illusionary magic as cows themselves the giant roc a 
none	 gargantuan bird  swooped down and grabbed cowleth keyleth here swept her away the rest of the party tiberius  enabled to fly through arcane means and thus we had a squadron of evening cows chasing after the  roc which then got turned into a cow to crash into a mountain they chased it back to its perch  up in the cliffside mountains to the northwest of emon  liam such an old trope in fantasy  matt isnt it though cowmouflage and engaged a guardian of this roc a gnome druid who  had been removed from 
none	 society for quite some time after some rather roundabout and at some points  ontheedgeofconflict conversation they managed to convince him to instead take the bird and flee  across the ozmit sea to the northwest towards vasselheim where it would be a much better  landscape for the creature to thrive and grow after that the party is making their way back right around  the beginning of daybreak towards the keep so that is where we left off percy  taliesin yes hello  matt darkness cold lonely darkness a flicker of light it swells bright white blinding 
none	 then  flashes of your family screaming julius silenced by a bolt to the throat vesper thrown  from a tower wall your younger brothers lifeless bodies tossed in a pile the smell of death  filling your cell your father frederick a blade jutting from his chest slick with crimson your  mother johanna burned with irons screaming cassandra running towards you calling your name  into the night begging you to help one two three arrows she falls darkness once more  darkness and red red of blood red of burning fire the sky is fire the world 
none	 burns with flame  and iron the smoke rises from the cinders coalescing into a face black as soot with eyes as  burning coals and a wicked grin it speaks with a raspy rumbling bass like a slowmoving  landslide you hold your vengeance percival you made it you only need to take it for yourself  make the world right my gift is yours and your gift shall bring justice our bargain stands eager  to close  you suddenly come to consciousness gasping loudly against the air you feel the warmth of the forge  across the 
none	 side of the workshop crawling across your face you are sitting at your workbench  having fallen asleep amidst a pile of contraptions in midconstruction as you look around you can  see your leather gloves are still on apron on blackened soot spread across your face and a  series of things you were in midbuild on broken before you on your workshop table  talisen sighs how long have i been here  matt theres nobody in the room and you have no idea youre underground in the workshop you  havent seen the sun probably for a 
none	 good day and a half  orion its a new day i didnt waste it at all  matt you have no idea quite how long youve been down here and youve been left alone for quite  some time  talisen im going to head upstairs  matt you go and open the metallic door that leads into your workshop and come around the corner and  theres a chair set in the corner where jarett would be sitting one of the head guards at your  facility jarett however is standing hands up to his throat going choking 
none	 sounds with no  visible assailant  taliesin shouting help  sam are we there no were not even there  matt i want you to go ahead and roll initiative  sam oh shit its already started  laura trinket was down there  sam was  laura dont say that  sam just saying that trinket died already  laura dont say it  taliesin natural 20 28  cheering  matt and thats how percy does it  travis what is with that dice and you man  liam you are the yin to wil wheatons yang 
none	  taliesin he was sitting here 20 minutes ago i rubbed him for luck when he was leaving the  building  marisha no we have him its balance  matt all right so whats your total  taliesin 28  matt 28 laughs you are definitely okay you are up first what do you want to do as you come  around the corner and you see this visual in front of you if you want to go ahead and roll for  trinket too  laura worried noises oh no  taliesin so i just see him up 
none	 like this  laura 19  matt 19 nice  taliesin just for some reference does it look like hes possessed or does it look like hes  trying to remove something  matt it looks like hes trying to remove something from around his neck and looking down  you can see his feet are actually off the ground kicking it looks like theres a little bit of air  wisping around behind him  taliesin how insane would it be to try and make a shot beneath his legs  matt you can certainly go for it and 
none	 try  taliesin im going to drop down can i make an aimed shot against something i cant see  matt you can try itll be with disadvantage but you can definitely make it  orion hes in the kitchen  laura no hes downstairs  sam can i request that the rest of us do the sounds of the ricocheting bullets in case he  misses  taliesin okay i want 51 start here and make it all the way down  laura but youre not going to miss so it doesnt matter  taliesin im going to take 
none	 an aimed shot for my first shot and then start firing blindly  matt this will be disadvantage against an invisible assailant  travis it misses  taliesin it missed im just making sure i didnt misfire no i didnt thank god  matt so whats the total  taliesin 15  matt total of 15 still hits  taliesin still hits 15 hits oh thats 16 points of damage and he has to make a  constitution saving throw to not be knocked prone  matt okay whats the dc on that  taliesin where is my dc dc 
none	 of eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod so 19  matt sure enough you see all of a sudden the air go gasp and jaret falls to his knees coughs  taliesin im going to take two more shots right above his head  matt go for it  sam dont hit jarett  matt jaretts on his knees prone essentially  sam he could still hit jarett hes our best guy  matt you still have disadvantage on these  taliesin i dont  matt no you still have disadvantage on these it is still an 
none	 invisible creature  taliesin 20  matt 20 hits  taliesin thats 13  matt 13 does not hit  taliesin no 13 points of damage  matt oh yes  taliesin and then 20 again  matt 20 hits  taliesin nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage gunshots the gunshots are echoing through the hallway whatever  this weird entity is you can see some of the nearby cloth and dust swirl up from its movement  you hear this gasping sound this angry sucking sound in the air around you do you want to 
none	 move  or are you staying where you are  taliesin im going to stay where i am and im going to keep yelling help i dont think i have  an earring  matt you see some sort of shimmer of wind come around the corner towards you this one turns  around and whooshing sound over to the bars and you can see in the distance its moving over  towards where your captive currently is  orion how far away are we from the keep  matt im getting to that at the end of this combat 
none	 round all of you guys are right toward the  outskirts of the keep and you hear the muffled ringing of gunshots from the inside of the keep  orion we do hear that  matt you do hear this as youre just getting to the outer gates  orion as soon as i hear that i cast fly on myself and whoosh  laura are you wearing an earring percy  matt no he is not the entity swooshes down the stairs and comes at you thats going to be a 22  taliesin that hits  matt and 
none	 a 12  taliesin that does not  matt it swings towards you and a giant slam of extremely condensed air with a raking claw impact  hits you in the torso doing 15 points of bludgeoning damage the other one swings out same  direction this time you actually pull off to the side and knock it out of the way with your  pepperbox the one back there is going to attempt to grapple succeeds thats its action and you  can see the driver that you had put into prison is currently being choking making strangling sounds 
none	  in the distance that ends it trinkets up  laura trinket he can see percy getting attacked and instinct takes over and he runs forward and  he claws him  matt all right go ahead and roll for the attack  laura that does not hit thats a natural 20  matt that will hit laughs it begins  laura oh thats the wrong thing thats a 2d4  matt so roll 2d4 and then multiply those by two  laura 17 damage  matt 17 damage nice trinket runs up coming out of his somewhat sleepy stupor 
none	 goes for a bite  attack and grabs nothing with it and turns around and rakes a claw backwards manages to get the  back of whatever this entity is and you hear it scream gasping scream you do at least  taliesin i have a technical dispute really quickly could the wraith have gotten that far  since i knocked him prone  matt yes it couldve because it uses half its movement speed to get up  taliesin oh thank you never mind  matt its movement is actually 50  taliesin ignore me 50  matt not 
none	 that you know that but it moved far for what you think it shouldve been able to  orion by the way for the record matthew i have no idea what were fighting  travis nobody does  orion im just saying i havent metagamed here  matt congrats laughs im proud of you  liam fresh start  matt jarett then gets up sees this happening moves over and pulls out the key to try and open  the prison door spends the turn doing so manages to get the door open thats the end of jaretts  turn 
none	 okay now the rest of you guys roll initiative  travis okay come on you giant ballbearing damn  laura does that count if i hit it into my box and it slammed into the side does that count or  should i let it roll naturally  matt let it roll naturally that would normally count but its fine wherever it lands you take  it going forward okay so 25 to 20  sam oh initiative  taliesin keep up people come on  matt you hear the gunshot youre entering this intensity  sam i dont think 
none	 its anything i think its just him tinkering  matt so scanlan stays behind 25 to 20 20 to 15 what are your scores  liam and orion 15  laura 17  marisha and travis 16  taliesin thank you all by the way for leaving a bear on suicide watch that was really cool  laura youre welcome  matt vex whatd you get again  travis 17  laura i got 17  sam he got 15  matt 15 tiberius and whatd you get vax  liam 15  matt 15 all right three 15s  
none	 sam i got three  matt you got three okay all right so you guys all spend your turn if you choose to to rush  through the gates as soon as the gunshots go off you can see shaynes up on top and she sees it  gives a quick turn and you can see the gates begin to open and you hear this angry grunting as  your halforc guard is now pulling the doors open as fast as he can you guys find a moment and slip  through running towards the front of the keep you 
none	 guys manage to get with full dash and full  turn including your flight because you fly a little bit faster but you have a little more of  an arc to get over you guys get to the front of the keep this turn so you wont get into this  until next round that brings it back to the top percy youre up  taliesin sighs theres no way i can fire at the one whos far away from me right now is there  matt its hard to see  laura but jaretts got him  taliesin 
none	 i can ignore cover though  matt you can ignore cover but you have this entity in front of you i mean youll be at  disadvantage regardless because youre shooting at something invisible and you have something  thats in melee of you and you have a ranged weapon  taliesin im going to see if theres a charge left in my glove and try and take the there  wouldnt be a charge left in my glove would there  matt you glance down at the glove and you see the gemstone in the center of the palm 
dung	 is  currently dark and lifeless  taliesin okay sighs hold on sorry  travis fan the hammer motherfuck  taliesin it gets weird when its up close okay lets see what we do all right theres no way i  can step back right now is there  matt currently i mean you can if you want to itll get a free strike on you  taliesin okay im going to try and take shots then  matt the one in front of you okay go for it with disadvantage on each shot  taliesin firing with disadvantage screw 
none	 it im going to take my first one with sharpshooter to  see if i can do any damage that way nope actually thats a misfire  matt so pepperbox explosion sound you go to shoot and  marisha ricochet sound  matt the barrel gets clogged and the front of it actually catches fire for a second and you have  to shake it out right now its completely offset and its going to take a moment to even get it to  where you can fire again  taliesin okay do i have six seconds  matt you 
none	 do and youve used one attack you have two more attacks  taliesin well it misfired  matt yeah that weapon you have to use an action to repair  taliesin okay im going to do something a little weird im going to pull out bad news i know i  cant shoot this close with it or god only knows what would happen im going to try and swing it  like a pugil stick and im going to try and hit him with the butt of bad news  matt okay go ahead and make a melee attack 
none	 this is strengthbased add your proficiency modifier  and your strength modifier  taliesin 15  matt you still have disadvantage on it because you cant see it and youre not proficient  taliesin 15  matt 15 just barely hits  cheering  matt all right so go ahead and roll with the size of bad news id say 1d6 plus your strength  modifier  taliesin four  matt okay so four points of damage as you bludgeon it you took a turn to get it out your  third attack is then slamming it in the side 
none	 whatever entity you smacked gets pushed against  the wall go ahead and roll a d20 for me  taliesin 14  matt okay so the impact does not appear to damage bad news in this instance it is a fragile  construct and even doing melee attacks with it does subject it to a misfire possibility  taliesin i hit it with the stock i was careful  matt i know okay so that concludes your turn  taliesin yeah im kind of yeah  matt okay you stay there all right the one thats in front of you 
none	 now is going to go ahead  and go over this way trinket well no its still in melee so it doesnt actually get an  attack it does get two strikes on you that is a 17  taliesin nope  matt and that is 18  taliesin armor class is 18  matt so it does just hit you  taliesin can i do that crazy thing  matt no ive eliminated that  taliesin oh youve removed that okay never mind i dont have the new update sorry i dont  have a dodge anymore right  
none	 matt no the dodge is not there it rarely came into play okay so that puts you at another 15  points of bludgeoning damage as it just smacks you right across the head your eyes go dizzy for a  second and you take a minute to refocus your vision and you can now see in the air the  shimmering expression that looks like a humanoid face stretched and ghastly going gasps in front  of you but its still barely even visible and only because of the proximity to you are you able  to actually make 
none	 out any sort of shape or shimmer in the air in front of you the other one is  attempting to choke out the prisoner however the prisoner resists through athletics so hes  currently holding back at bay the strength of the entity that ends its turn trinkets up  laura trinkets up hes going to try to jump and land on top of the ghostly thing and bite its  face i dont know how to do that  matt laughs to do a real leap trinket would have to back up and then run towards it if 
none	  trinket wants to do that okay so trinket backs up as it does it gets one free swipe at trinket  that is 18 to hit  laura im having an issue here because i have 18 in parentheses and then i wrote a 20 and i  circled it and i dont know why  matt i dont know why either  laura 18 is probably  matt yeah well say 18 so that hits trinket takes 15 points of bludgeoning damage as the  entity swings out and backhands trinket however trinket now leaps go ahead and 
none	 make an athletics  check  liam he has better armor class than i do  sam does he have armor  laura he does hes got his bulette armor man hes a cannonball what am i doing a strength  matt athletics yeah  laura 17  matt 17 yeah trinket leaps forward slamming this entity onto the ground and knocking it prone  and you get to go ahead and make a bite attack  laura yes that didnt count because it slipped out of my hand that was even worse than the other  one so 11 
none	 it slipped out of my hand it shouldnt count if it goes like that 20  matt so trinket manages to knock it prone however because it gets pushed out of the way  trinket has a hard time trinket just makes a big slash and a bite out in the air where it once was  and misses entirely  laura but hes gone prone  matt but he is knocked prone jaretts now going to attempt to grapple the entity  sam wait trinket missed ricochet sound  laughter  matt jarett manages to reach out and grab 
none	 onto whatever this creature is hold onto it just  grappling and is going to attempt to try and pull it back for this i will do a contested roll on  that it rolled a one jarett pulled it back that far managing to let go of its quarry and is  currently holding onto some sort of angry whirling entity at that point that ends jaretts  turn the rest of you guys all manage to make your way up into the armory up top first is vex you  rush in there and what do you want 
none	 to do  laura i want to run down and shoot something  matt okay you can get just about there  laura can i see anything can i ricochet an arrow to hit  matt laughs i would say this guy has threequarters cover so it would be disadvantage  on the attack you already have disadvantage because its invisible so its hard to hit  regardless  laura that was the same one each time 28  matt 28 28 hits  laura oh i didnt fucking hunters mark him god damn it fuck 15  matt 15 
none	 points of damage the first arrow sinks into whatevers there and you can see it jutting  out of no physical space  laura now im going to hunters mark him and im going to hit him again can i do that  matt technically its part of your attack you can do two attacks first then you can bonus  action so youre like arrow sounds and then you hunters mark it after  laura all right that one doesnt hit doesnt matter doesnt hit anyway i missed it  sam ricochet sound  matt second shot shatters against 
none	 the back wall of the stone you can hunters mark for your  bonus  laura i hunters mark him  matt all right entity is now hunters marked that ends vexs turn keyleth you now also make  your way into the doorway  marisha how far can i get  matt about there nothings in visual sight right now unfortunately  marisha nothings in visual sight  matt no half of that was getting to that point you could dash and try and make your way in but  you wouldnt be able to do anything  marisha 
none	 can i dash and then make a bonus action  matt you could yeah your call what do you got grog youre on deck  marisha ill just wait  matt okay keyleth waits there grog youre up  marisha let me just scootch over so i can be behind vex  matt you have a little better movement so you actually manage to get two more squares in whats  your speed again  travis 50  matt 50 yeah you manage to get up to there and now your turn begins  travis i go into a rage 
none	 and i come in and i turn to the right and i run up as close as i can  to jared  laura jarett  travis yeah jarett and wispy fuck  matt all right so you charge in angry you see jaretts currently reaching back and trying to go  for his crossbow now that this entitys in his face hes grappled it with one arm and hes  reaching back to try and grab it you come rushing in go for it  travis i take out a holy oil vial out of the bag of holding 
none	 i crush it in my hand and i take a  swing at whatever hes holding  matt all right cool so as you pull out glass breaking the pain from the glass even further  angers you in your rage you can see a mix of holy water and blood trickle down from your fist as you  clench it go ahead and swing for a punch with disadvantage  travis thats a one  matt so that first strike just whiffs over through your anger youre unable to focus on  where this entity may be  travis 
none	 not off to a good start with this number two disadvantage fuck  matt whats the total  travis 15  matt 15 just barely hits go ahead and roll  travis one of these guys  matt go ahead and roll that half that damage yes  travis one plus rage which is  matt plus strength  travis oh right eight  matt so eight points of damage to it all righty whack it hits and you hear this yelps sound  as it takes the impact and you can see this strange angry face appear suddenly out 
none	 of the  shimmering air that just then disperses again and you dont quite know where it is you can make a  third strike now if you want  laura did it do any holy damage  matt did not appear to have any additional effect on the entity  travis well hell it was worth a shot oh at disadvantage 19  matt 19 still hits go ahead and roll the next attack  travis eight again  matt eight damage again whack you backhand it with your third strike this time finding the edge  of its 
none	 face again and you see the chair right next to it tumble as it barely manages to catch  itself and keep itself aloft nevertheless this strange invisible entity is still there holding  its ground  travis would you say the blood from my hand is splattering jarett behind him  matt you look over at jarett jaretts currently trying to grab onto the creature and keep it  grappled so yeah its spattering on him  travis im a painter  matt laughs all right that ends grogs turn vax and tiberius you guys both get up to 
none	 the edge  of this room here  orion your cape is looking really nice vax  liam im clicking my boots of haste and i get double movement so i get to go 60 feet im going  to slink up right beside trinket and stab the shit out of this invisible thing  orion stab him hey what do they look like  liam so because trinkets right there this is a sneak attack that hits that is 29 to hit  matt thatll hit  laughter  matt it is prone it is invisible but it is 
none	 prone so that evens out to no advantage or  disadvantage  liam counting 25 for the first hit  matt 25 all right  laura dont you double it you had to double 19  liam no he didnt thats a critical hit  laura oh right  liam one shy so now out comes the dagger of lifestealing it misses well does 15 hit  matt 15 just barely hits  liam just barely hits oh thats better than i thought that is three plus six is nine for  damage and then the keen dagger comes back 
none	 and that gets a 27 so that also hits for nine of  damage  matt all right so as you rush over you stab downward you hear this gurgle sound as your  blade comes down into whatever entitys there and your hand moves around as it struggles against the  blade you pull it out grab your other dagger and then throw it in the air catch it slam it  down again for that third strike and then pull back and stab a third time  liam and trinket is very comforting pressed against my shoulder as 
none	 i do all that hes  supple  matt supple bear supplebear all right that ends your turn tiberius what are you doing  orion how far can i get  matt thats about as far as you can get with your movement you currently do not have visual on  either of them youre flying whats your fly speed  orion 60 feet  matt you said that last time and we found out it was 40 i believe wasnt it  orion was it 40 i thought it was 60 it was double the shit hold on i 
none	 have a card  matt you have a card and yet i find it faster  orion 60 feet  matt it is 60 youre right yeah so you can go double you are now just coasting down the  stairway  orion im going to attempt something i havent actually tried before  matt all right go for it  orion because theres one to my right and one to my left right  matt correct theres one over here that has grog and jarett flanking the other one has percy vax  and trinket all around it that 
none	 ones actually prone on the ground its hard to see normally  its very hard to see now that its swarmed  orion do i have visual of both wraiths  matt you have visual of both entities whatever they are  orion okay sorry i call them wraiths okay so im going to cast at  sam have we rested by the way  matt no you have not rested yet  sam so were down a bunch of spells  matt yeah youre still where you were when you came back  marisha well to be fair we 
none	 talked we didnt have a battle  sam some of us used spells fly and stuff  orion im going to try to do this about now im going to look to my right and my left and at  6thlevel im going to try to do glacial blast and split the damage and try to hit both of them  because it does 8d8 damage  matt are you doing this singlestream  orion im trying to split my arc so instead of doing this im trying to ice sounds  matt okay how much damage is it  
none	 orion at sixth level its 8d8 damage  matt okay and whats the saving throw  orion 17  matt 17 okay jarett and vax have to make saving throws as well go ahead and make that jarett  rolled an 18 and has high dex so yeah jarett makes his save thats halfdamage for jarett  liam 28 for me  matt all right so you take no damage because youre a rogue go ahead and roll damage thats  18 for one this one fails this one succeeds  orion cool right hand does oh sweet  marisha 
none	 no thats a d10 these are d8s  orion sorry my bad  matt its actually not prone theyre immune to being prone  orion right hand thats 14 to my right and then 18 to my left  matt so how much is that  orion so 14 to my right 18 to my left  matt okay got you  orion the one that doesnt save gets freezing sound  matt it would if it wasnt immune however as you arc down the ice blast comes through you can  see vax manages to pull down to the 
none	 ground and get out of the way in time jarett ducks out of the  way and it blasts over hitting both these entities ice crackles around both their forms  but then the forms shift out of it that ends your turn right there comes back to scanlan  sam oh where am i  matt you are right there just entered the room behind everybody else  sam where does percy do his tinkering  matt over here  sam because i cant see whats going on down there  matt no you just see currently these three 
none	 down the hallway you can just see tiberius blast  a bunch of ice arc in the air  sam okay so i know theres shit going on down there but i cant really see what so i would  probably just dimension door into the tinkering room because thats where i assume percy is and  then i see whats going on and nobodys there do i have lineofsight on anybody  matt currently you see percy through this doorway right there  sam okay well then i can move also cant i  matt yeah dimension door is 
none	 your action  sam ill move towards him oh then i see a crazy thing in front of me shit so i probably take a  couple steps back  laughter  sam and then ill inspire percy sings all the single percys all the single percys  all sing all the single percys all the single percys put your guns upupup  matt d10 inspiration dice to you percy  taliesin what is that a d10  matt d10 yeah that brings it to the top of the combat round percy youre up first  taliesin im going to 
none	 use my action to try and clear my gun  matt okay so go ahead and make your check  taliesin what is that again did it change since last time  matt that one shouldnt have changed no  taliesin okay so its 11 im adding my bonus die god damn it nine  matt nine as you pull over your pepperbox youre like ping the actual barrel comes off  and hits the ground and rolls off toward the back of the room  taliesin im tossing it into my room im using an action surge actually can 
none	 i even do that  yes im going to use my action surge and im going to walk over to the wraith on the ground  put the barrel of bad news up to it and pull the trigger  matt the wraith is no longer on the ground by the way  taliesin is he not  matt the entity actually upon looking is immune to being prone so we wont retcon anything but  as you go to pull the barrel up you can see now the face is standing up before you  taliesin im just going 
none	 to try and shove it until i hit something and then pull  matt okay so go ahead and roll with disadvantage with bad news  taliesin 22  matt 22 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis oh shit were all going to go deaf  laura oh man thats going to be loud as fuck  taliesin 19  matt 19 gunshot bad news goes off the sound is deafening in the room the echoing of the  explosion through the stone walls im going to go ahead and have you roll a constitution saving  throw 
none	  liam vax or liam  matt vax both maybe  liam roll a what now  matt constitution saving throw  taliesin if you fail i get to scream in your ear  liam that is a 15  matt 15 okay you dont go deaf but your ears are ringing very hard the entity screams and then  disperses  taliesin i get a grit point back  marisha you do dope  matt okay so two more attacks or you have to use one to reload  taliesin i have to use one to reload i have 
none	 one more attack but ive already i didnt move im  going to try and roll around the corner and im going to take another shot 27  matt 27 hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin 19 points of damage  matt okay this time gunshot the shot goes off right by your head tiberius youre flying in the  air and you look down and see him pull bad news out right beneath you and before you have a  chance to react gunshot the flash of the muzzle just bursting forward a big plume of black 
none	 powder  smoke fills the air around you  orion so i see a big flash and what do i roll  matt make a constitution saving throw  taliesin sorry  orion seven  matt okay you are considered deaf until the start of his next turn  orion okay so as soon as i see the flash i go yelps thats all i do  laughter  matt so that ends your turn percy all right next this entity thats hunters marked is going to  rush forward straight out of the grapple from jarett shifts right out 
none	 of his hands is going to  run forward and take the double attack against the prisoner thats a 19 plus six 25 hits and 15  hits as well takes 30 points of damage is currently unconscious punches him twice and you  see the poor driver is knocked up into the ceiling falls down onto the bed and is  halflaying off you see blood trickling down the front of his face his eyes open and slowly  close  marisha we need him alive  matt that brings us to trinkets turn  marisha come on trinket 
none	  laura trinket roars rushes forward  matt actually were now going to roll trinket into your turn  laura oh all right then he stays there  matt okay trinket stays there until its your turn jarett is going to rush forward and come to  this corner the crossbow is not much aid at this point reaches over and pulls out a short sword  and lunges forward with the short sword yeah with disadvantage nine oh god rolls a 20 and a  three great sorry jarett swinging through trying to pierce through the bars at this 
none	 entity  and cant seem to get any sort of attack to hit  laura so hes actually locked in the thing still  matt jarett got the door open he came through to try and grab the creature and as he tried to pull  it back the creature sifted through his hands again to go ahead and attack the prisoner that  ends jaretts turn vex it is now your turn  laura okay can i move forward so i can see  matt yeah you can see about there it would give you visual on the entity 
none	  laura all right yeah ill do that ill shoot him hes hunters marked already okay good  matt he is yes so both attacks at disadvantage  laura 15  matt 15 hits just hits  laura 16  matt 16 also hits oh 16 damage all right including the additional hunters mark  laura yes and then 14 doesnt hit  matt 14 does not hit the arrow disappears in the back of the cell scattering and shattering  against part of the stone wall  laura and trinket can he get up to him oh but i 
none	 took all the attacks  matt correct so trinket rushes up but doesnt attack  laura trinket stays in the corner then because he cant do shit  matt okay trinket just cheers you on bear growl cool that ends your turn keyleth  marisha okay im going to seeing the direction that everyones pointing going to walk up and  reach around vex and im going to cast faerie fire right oh god wrong direction right in the  fucking eye  laughter  liam you turn on yourself  marisha crit fail its a 20foot cube so i 
none	 want to cast it right in the cell  matt okay so as you cast that its going to attempt to make its save whats the dc on that  marisha against my spells dc 18  matt and it fails with a 14 all right so you guys watch as she reaches her hand out the entire  cell all of a sudden theres a burst of purplish light and these little duststars of purple  glowing begin to drift down from the ceiling as they do they cling to whatever this form is and  you can now 
none	 see very clearly this invisible entity that is surrounded in these purple  sparkles it looks humanoid from the torso up but its legs are shimmering and shifting around you  now have a very clear look on it youve nullified its invisibility  marisha you have advantage now  matt gives advantage as well yeah you guys now all have advantage on this entity  marisha and im going to take my bonus action to do healing word on the its not jarett thats  unconscious its the cab driver on the cab driver  matt okay so go 
none	 ahead and roll for the healing word  sam desmond jarett and desmond  matt how much does he heal  marisha six plus my spell modifier so ten is that right is that how it works plus my spell  level is that what it is with healing word  matt i think its plus five whatever it is healing word yeah  marisha 1d4 plus my spellcasting ability modifier  matt so its plus six  marisha six so 12  matt 12 got you okay desmonds eyes clarify for a second and he begins to breathe heavily 
none	  still looking very wounded but conscious and prone across the bed as the entity thats  hunters marked is still looming over it bringing its fists up for another round to try and finish  its job that ends your turn keyleth grog youre up  travis there you are hold still casper and i run up and i swing  laughter  matt as you rush up angrily make your strike  travis thats 28  matt that hits  travis thats a 27  matt hits  liam those would hit tiamat  travis 17  matt 
none	 17 also hits so roll damage three times as you rush up the bars open bringing the axe down  on top of this now sparkling purple entity  travis ten so 14 on the first one plus fire damage  matt cool  travis 17 plus 21 no is that right did i do that right  laura yeah  travis yeah so 21 the second one  matt okay  travis and 17 21 again  matt nice all righty so you run up hammer strikes hammer down a third time you can see its  body being 
town	 beaten around by the attack and you see the whispering of its wind around its lower  body is starting to slow and its looking like its getting more sluggish but its definitely  still intent on its job that ends your turn grog vax youre up  liam all right in a split second im watching grog take the thing apart i size up everybody in  front of me in the distance and i think i can assassin creed my way through the crowd because i  can go 60 feet normally so 30 feet if its crowded 
none	 and im going to use grogs proximity to  take this thing apart  matt okay i will say you would normally get advantage because youre attacking it through the  bars melee it disables it so its just a straight attack youre having to fight it through  prison bars with daggers which is difficult  liam all right so the first one is terrible its a 14  matt 14 misses unfortunately  liam and thats where the sneak attack damage is right  matt well its the first attack you get on it would get it so 
none	 even if you miss the first  attack you can still get it with the second and third  liam all right third one is a 21  matt that does hit  liam so theres the delivery system and that is the keen dagger 26 27 32 38  matt all right with that the first blade comes through and you try and get it through the bars  and it gets nothing you pull back take the other dagger and swing through it falls too wide and  you have to bring your arm back this time you 
none	 can see after grog has slammed it with the hammer  it falls the sparkles come towards the edge its slamming its back into the bars its right  there in front of you and you use that instance to go ahead and reach through the bars grab it by  the throat and stab it repeatedly at which point its form disperses into wind around you  liam and i slap grog on the back and say you softened the shit of him thats terrible  english you softened him up for me asshole  travis youve been drinking 
none	  laura giggling you softened the shit of him  liam you shitted him up for me grog good job  matt you guys look over you see desmond is still on the bed eyes wide panting  orion i rush over to desmond and out of my pouch i bring out a sandwich that i had made earlier i  hand it to him and i go desmond decker here have it its a decker sandwich you should have  it  matt gets up on the bed and takes it what happened  laura i run up and 
none	 i cast cure wounds on him  matt okay so go ahead and roll for the cure wounds heal on that  travis you casting that all over the place now arent you fancypants  sam from the tinkering room i yell out is it safe can i come out now  orion its safe  liam theres four more of them stay back  sam oh okay ill stay  travis i remember i have the holy oil in my hand mixed with the blood and i start blessing him with  bloody fist  laura 17  matt 
none	 all right awesome  laura do i add my wisdom to that  matt you add your wisdom modifier  laura then its 20  matt thats good to know all right cool all right  orion hows that sandwich  matt desmond isnt eating it hes just holding it and still taking in what happened what was  that look what was that thing  travis yeah what was that thing  laura what was that thing  orion i would say opaque buttholes  marisha can we do a check  matt make an arcana check  taliesin 
none	 ill make an arcana check too  sam how did you get two  orion i rolled one by accident  matt if you rolled by accident you have to roll intentionally to take the score because if you  were to accidentally roll really bad youd be like that doesnt count i didnt actually  roll  orion a hard 12  matt total of 12  liam i rolled a 22 arcana check  marisha 22  laura oh hes faced these things before thats what it is  matt thats the thing youve seen these these entities 
none	 are used by certain highlevel arcane  practitioners they can be summoned as certain spells theyre air elementalbased in nature but  theyre generally known as invisible stalkers theyre used as assassins that have a very sole  singleminded purpose  liam all i know is they feel like the briarwoods  matt you get that based on recent events theres probably a good probability that was the  source of this  laura do you know from your previous experience if theres any way to protect against them other  than setting up walls  liam well all i 
none	 know is how to stick my face in the beehives apparently  laura does anybody know how to protect against air stalkers  orion give me a day i will find out  matt jarett at which point has put his hand against the wall and goes ugh i would  recommend that next time you decide to put me on watch let me know if were up against things that  are invisible i apologize i was not prepared for such a foe to show up  laura we were unprepared to warn you im sorry  matt its 
none	 all right if i might ask what exactly are we up against here  travis fuck if we know  orion seems like were up against either vampires or liches prepare the troops there will be some  changes made to the keep over the next couple of days we shall shore up security as well  matt i would like also to consider possibly some changes made to our income as this suddenly  turned from a general guarding job to going up against the denizens of the afterlife its  already been a very dangerous proposition  orion 
none	 of course we shall discuss that in the is it the morning  matt very well im going to go ahead and make sure the rest of my team is alive  liam jarett are you up for it  matt if the pay is good yes  laura jaretts up for anything  matt you understand ugh okay talk to you in the morning i think a bit of rest is necessary  and he makes his way up the stairs to the rest of the keep desmond at this point is still in shock  and he starts 
none	 absentmindedly eating the sandwich that you handed him  orion its good right i had one yesterday  laura well maybe its best not to leave him down here  orion no you should stay in the guest room come  matt is it safer there  orion yes it is  matt i told you theyd come for me i told you they would  laura but you know what youre still alive  sam youve had the worst couple of days  matt wipes the blood from the side of his face and looks at it  orion 
none	 lets take you upstairs and get you all fitted who do we talk to that works for us that  does the actual construction to the keep  laura that is one of uriels staff in which case we cannot talk to them right now  matt yeah the individual responsible for the construction of the keep was lord riskel daxio  which is an elven gentleman on the council that helped oversee the whole construction and helped  you guys design it so  liam is he still on the bed  matt still on the bed  liam 
none	 i sit down next to him and say listen you are a victim of circumstance we understand that  we are to a certain degree as well were not leaving your side and really theres no other  choice i mean youre fucked like we are so we will do our best to protect you i promise you  matt okay  travis i volunteer to sleep down in the room  liam oh wow  orion he shall stay in my quarters  travis its better down here isnt it  liam in a locked cell with grog i 
none	 think is pretty safe  laura i think its probably better to bring him upstairs because if its locked we cant get to  him very quickly  orion dont worry we can enchant his room as well to have an alert thing go on if anything  happens in the room at night and it would be safer i shall be sleeping in my laboratory for  the next several nights as well  marisha i mean i can still go ahead and do the planar bindings to an elemental that maybe i  shouldve done beforehand it lasts 
none	 30 days  liam i like all of these things but i think grog as a bunkmate is a good idea  matt at this point desmond leans into you and quietly says in your ear vax he goes is where  im sleeping going to be away from him he looks over towards percy  travis yeah totally away from him  marisha its fine youll have him in between you and him  matt you dont hear that its whispered to vax  liam there is a lot of history for percy wrapped up in this and he 
none	 has done you wrong no question  but the answer is yes you will be separate from percival you will be protected and you have my  word  matt make a persuasion roll  laura and you have my axe  liam im going to use some luck using my luck natural 20 with luck  matt takes another bite of the sandwich and packs it away in a little piece of cloth he had in a  pocket puts it in there and you know you can still see as he brings his hand up you can see 
none	 the  blood streak against where the fingers were on the lower half of that hand strokes the edge of his  chin and goes okay i trust you please please dont let them kill me  liam we may be fuckups  orion speak for yourself  liam but were not without ability you have my word i promise you  matt okay im very tired  laura desmond dear lets go upstairs grog that bed needs to go back up to the guest room  travis fucking hell i start to take the fucking bed up the stairs 
none	  matt takes you roughly another 20 minutes or so to bring it out of there fitting it through the  door  orion erwen where is that old man  matt as you call out erwen eventually comes down hi yes tiberius you called its quite  early in the morning he has his night cap on and hes rubbing at his eyes  marisha what time is it  matt right now its about probably 630 in the morning or so its just after sunrise you guys  havent even slept yet  orion oh shit never mind 
none	 ill talk to you once weve slept go back to sleep i didnt realize  what time it was i thought it was 1000 am which is totally different than 600 am i didnt know  that  matt its all right all right in the morning then master tiberius and he goes off to his bed  to sleep  travis we go to sleep  laura yeah we need to sleep  sam i gently fall asleep under percys workbench where ive been hiding this whole time  matt okay make a stealth check  taliesin not going 
none	 to sleep down there  sam natural 20  matt all right so as the rest of you go to sleep  taliesin im going to go into my workshop  liam on my way up i fall in next to keyleth ask is your hand all right  marisha its fine  liam do you need anything  marisha nope  travis since hes sleeping in the room with me i take a few of the caltrops that i have and i put  them on the inside of the doorway before i close it  matt okay so 
none	 you guys are doing your setup there percy youre in your workshop go ahead and  roll a perception check percy  taliesin 17  matt 17 okay you go about your work  taliesin im fixing my gun  matt okay the materials that it requires you to do so are expensive you actually have to pay the  cost of the gun and go ahead and make another check  sam the fuck is that sound  matt so go ahead and make another tinkering check and the cost of the pepperbox should be at the bottom  
dung	 of your  taliesin is it the whole cost or half  matt should be half the cost it should say under the repair rules for a misfire  taliesin half cost oh my god thats awful okay tinkering check 12  matt 12 okay  taliesin technically that would be a success  matt yeah so you take the rest of the morning unsleeping the dark bags under your eyes you  manage to get the pepperbox back in working order  taliesin oh i was asleep i wasnt with them so i just woke up really early  
none	 matt right right but even so even though you slept it hasnt been very restful its been  technically enough to rest but your evening has been fraught with nightmares perpetually but  your pepperbox is repaired and does cost you half the cost of the weapon cost to repair  taliesin 75 gold  orion i sleep in my little nook in my laboratory  matt okay you guys rest through the rest of the morning waking up past noon probably about 200  in the afternoon you all gradually begin to come to consciousness make your way downstairs 
none	 as you  come downstairs you can already smell breakfast has been prepared you can see laina already has  the meal set out for you and as you guys approach oh its so nice of all of you to come  down it was very interesting these very nice folks came by this morning and dropped off a whole  bunch of food and fresh veggies and stuff makes for a great meal it was very nice of them food  is served and she gives out the plates and gives you a smile  travis i love you eating 
none	 noises  liam is this a frittata  matt i believe thats what its called in some circles im trying a few new things  travis can i make a beard check  orion im going to take some food and feed it to lockheed and roll for my animal handling for the  day  travis 66  matt no effect unfortunately  travis just a little tingle  matt there is a slight tingle but its mostly a placebo  laughter  matt as you guys are having your meals and youre trying and youre feeding food teaching 
none	 this  everyone roll a perception check  liam at home  orion 16  liam i rolled a one  marisha 17  liam this frittata is lovely  sam six  travis eight  laura 16 but my passive is 21  matt right understood good to know percys down in his workshop as you guys are in the  middle of your meal you hear clearing the stillness and quiet of the low munchingup  clears throat and sitting at the table adjacent to you guys completely unnoticed in his entry is  seeker asum arms crossed 
none	  laura motherfucker you are sneaky i need to talk to you  travis we are not cool right now  matt well obviously not thats why im here to have a conversation with the rest of you please  continue to eat i dont mean to disturb you  orion oh very well  laura help yourself to a frittata  matt ive already eaten but i appreciate the offer  orion try this hakuna frittata its really good  travis hakuna matata  laura let him talk  matt what a wonderful meal well things have certainly gotten 
none	 sticky havent they well first  and foremost i would like to thank you keyleth for clearing my head lord briarwood had locked me  into some form of mental charm during my attempt to aid vax  marisha i told you it worked sorry im a little defensive right now continue  matt thats all right things are a bit mixed up its hard to explain lets just say i have  been clouded in my judgment for the past few days until you cleansed me im sorry to uphold the  charade back in the palace  liam 
dung	 apologies are mine i think i believe you had some sort of plan and i thought i knew  better and for that im sorry  matt i cannot say that is untrue but i accept your apology  laura can i roll for insight  matt you may  liam roll high  laura i know that was a shit roll nine  matt hes a hard person to gauge anyway you gathered over time that most of his work deals in  a network of spies and the gathering of information across all of taldorei so he is 
none	 very  welltrained to hide the essence of his true nature and the intent hard to read but he seems  pleasant as hes been and given the circumstances nevertheless i accept your  apology and i apologize for having upheld the charade during the council meeting but i had to  keep up appearances so as not to cause any sort of stir at the time i fear based on my observations  since that our very own sovereign also fell to the same charm i did and has been clouded since  the dinner the night before  
none	 laura shit that makes sense  marisha we were afraid of that  sam hes fallen for that stuff before  matt hes been through quite a bit and while hes a resolute and a very good man i would say  that he is predisposed to outer influence from those that are quite strongwilled  sam and this is why you kept up our accusations against us in front of him  matt under those conditions the room filled with guards that were all intent against keeping  you at bay should you have made any attempt to try 
none	 and cleanse him as well during that time i  think you all would have wound up in prison or worse  marisha so why didnt you want to show that you were also cleansed what was the point of holding  up the charade  matt because when youre under this influence to speak against the proposed ally of the charm is  to draw a line i wish to stay in his good graces because that would enable us a much better chance  of getting you close enough to him to absolve him of this charm if 
none	 i was to reveal this  instantaneously in the presence of the entire council i fear that might have put me in the same  court of disfavor as you and lost any future chance of expelling this influence  laura do you its only uriel or do you think its the rest of the council as well  matt best i can gather most of the council is not as well how do i put it not used to  business with vox machina allura seems to be of clear mind as she is very powerfully protected  against 
none	 such influences and did not have any immediate interaction with the briarwoods during  that dinner i fear the intent was on the sovereign himself  sam wait are you saying that the briarwoods corrupted him  matt same way they corrupted me  sam during the dinner while we were all sitting there  matt apparently it takes naught but a glance  laura oh shit they could have gotten any of us  orion yes they did me it was rather inconvenient i hate them sorry  matt i think we have something in common  sam arent 
none	 you deaf  liam no that was brief  orion i mean what  sam is that why youre talking so loud  orion yes i was getting it back  matt there are a few options at our disposal you could continue to work to clear your name  during his distraction southward if you have some idea as to how we could get close enough to him to  absolve him of this now that would leave the risk of should anything go poorly being poked with  many spear holes  laura is it possible to sneak 
none	 into his room and restore him without anybody knowing  matt if youre confident that may be more of a mission for the quieter of your bunch should they  be a little more intelligent with their actions going forward  orion what about drawing him out to a luncheon or whatnot  matt i will say based on recent circumstances he is very careful and defensive  liam i have fair chances of getting in but no ability to cure him of any such thing  laura what if keyleth who can do it polymorphed into a fly or 
none	 a very small creature traveled on  you you snuck in she popped out did the thing money  sam laughs unless theyre caught in which case youve got two of our members against the  entire palace guard  laura so then you go with them and dimension door out  sam i didnt even want to face the little invisible thing downstairs  orion why dont we hold a special dinner  sam he hates our fucking guts  travis why dont we let seeker asum finish  sam seeker asum in your opinion is it safer to 
none	 try and heal him or to try and clear our name  through the traditional legal means  matt honestly i have no idea i think this plan if successful is quite inspired however  failure would probably end in the immediate incarceration andor death of both individuals  involved public execution does not befit the countrywide name of vox machina if you were to  fail if you were to succeed that would be the most direct route between two points  marisha so are we in agreement that we have to clear uriels mind first  sam no 
none	 no the other option is to clear our names and not worry about clearing his mind  laura uriel if hes got his mind controlled it doesnt matter if we try to clear our names hes  going to find us guilty  sam but during our trial we will have a direct line of sight to him we might be able to get  through to him  liam does he still trust allura  matt as far as i know yes  travis you know if we kill the briarwoods is this even a point  sam thats 
none	 true he doesnt trust allura she wasnt even allowed in the room to talk to us  theres definitely suspicion there right  liam he did he did question her allegiances  matt if thats the case then perhaps her current power is not as strong in the council when  regarding you but she is still a member of the council should she not be immediately affiliated  with you for her purposes this is up to you whatever you choose to do if it requires my aid  i will give it a day before i have to 
none	 leave my next intent is to head well i wish to go past  the eastern curtain set up by whitestone into wildemount i have spent the better part of the  past day since the cleansing seeking all records of the briarwoods and their doings there was a  period of about eight years in which there is no public record of their goingson it appears that  most records that deal with their involvement in wildemount and whatever homestead gave them their  title lord and lady briarwood has all been but erased so i intend to go 
none	 to the source  wildemount itself and research this will take me some time of course  orion when do you plan on leaving  matt sooner the better i was thinking tomorrow  marisha is percy here is percy in the room  matt percy is not even here percy is down in the workshop  marisha i go get percy  matt okay  taliesin i was going to be at the door  marisha oh i come around the corner and i see percy  matt as you come around the corner percy is currently leaning up 
none	 against the side of the wall  listening in to the conversation  marisha hey i was looking for you you want to come and actually join the conversation for once  instead of sitting outside the door and just listening to them because i really feel like this  is going to be your time to input and maybe really help  taliesin i dont feel like doing that oh lead on  marisha okay  travis seeker asum we have managed to capture and keep one of the coachmen down in our cell  would he be safer 
none	 in our hands or within the castle walls  marisha percy and i walk in  travis im fucking asking  matt well that depends if you have strong defenses and the enemy has no means of entering  then he will be safer here the palace itself is a very wellprotected area however there currently  is an open invitation into the palace and if the essence of our enemy is as i think it is then  they can enter whenever they like  travis never mind  liam i think were really choosing between two paths here 
town	 either we stay in town and tinker and  gamble or were runaways  sam runaways no we go to the briarwoods  liam thats what im talking about the minute we leave were outlaws theyve told us not to go  orion we can leave we just cannot flee we can travel as we see fit we just need to let them  know where were going  liam yeah but we cant tell them were going to check out your associates  travis yeah we lie  marisha wait whats the name of the town  sam whitestone 
none	  marisha not whitestone oh i thought he was saying he was going to go to their hometown  matt hes going to wildemount the kingdom that theyre originally from the continent to the far  east  marisha hes not going to whitestone hes going to go to wildemount which is on another  continent if we go to another continent it doesnt matter if were fleeing or not its going  to look like fleeing  travis why are you going to wildemount again  matt im trying to find as much information to incriminate them in case 
none	 whatever youre  attempting does not work  orion seeker would you mind staying for a week or so before your venture we need time to  convince the council to let us leave without conflict and to procure particular items and  things that we need very briefly would just take some time  matt i have already made arrangements for travel i could try but depends on what you need  me here for  travis what do we need him here for  orion ultimately protection or a good ear  marisha do you genuinely think theyre 
none	 going to let us go with permission were not on their good  side  laura no theyre not theyre not going to let us go  liam were going to be outlaws we have to clear ourselves by ending the charm on uriel by  finishing off sylas  sam or by killing the briarwoods thus ending the charm  liam sylas briarwood  matt so that would be a way to clear your name and clear his head  travis lets do that  sam percival  orion what of eight days instead of two weeks oh sorry 
none	  sam percival what do you think we should do go seek revenge on your family and get some blood on  our hands briarwood blood or do the sneaky thing and try to  laura please we need your input  marisha you know them better than anyone  taliesin i really dont i think were here because i wasnt prepared  marisha can i do an insight check on him see if he knows more than what hes saying  matt sure  marisha 19  matt you can go ahead and roll a d20  marisha is 
none	 that a nine  taliesin nine  matt is there anything youre holding back  taliesin nope  matt he seems clear as day telling the honest truth  liam i dont think were here in this city to become lords and ladies serving uriel as good a  man he is i think percivals our ally and this is a grievous wrong done to him and we can kill  two birds with one stone  taliesin i think we are in the situation were in because we now know how much we dont know how  much i 
town	 dont know im not prepared if we face them now im going to get you all killed  orion i agree we need proper preparation percy im pretty sure you have a good background on  vampires and whathaveyou as do i as ive researched them in the last couple of days  theres other things that we should research as well and probably arm ourselves for that kind of  conflict if it comes to it quite frankly i have a feeling if its the whole town were dealing  with we need to find out how many innocents 
none	 there are to save and if the number is low enough we  can fly in with an army ourselves which would take some time the draconian knights i am an  ambassador to draconia officially after all the assistance ive sent in giving them the wheel of  mending and proving my point  laura you gave them the wheel  orion no i showed it to them proving that my quest was true which they gave me full  ambassadorship which means that if harm comes to a stormwind harm comes to all of draconia and a  
town	 town full of vampires and liches  laura i didnt know we had a whole army at our disposal thats wonderful to hear  orion if worse comes to worst  liam started on the bottom now were here  sam diplomatic immunity  orion even then our relations must be strong with emon we need their allyship as well  draconia will not go into things alone we need a union  marisha i agree while were not serving uriel thats not our purpose i also dont want to leave  an enemy of the state thats not good 
none	 for me for what i want  orion i go up to jarett eight days what do you think of eight days  marisha and what go with jarett not jarett asum  sam hes not even going where we would be going we would be going to whitestone right thats  where the briarwoods are  liam but keyleth uriel is the law and the law is now corrupt  marisha then why dont we save his mind before we go  laura heres the thing hes going to find out stuff about the briarwoods whats the fucking  
none	 point of him going if were just going to go attack the briarwoods before we know what he  knows we need to let him go find out his shit take care of uriel wait until he gets back go  take out the briarwoods  orion as vex is saying this tiberius is getting a halfchub  travis and laura a what  taliesin well thats just weird  orion you cant see it because its inside  liam yes but you said it out loud  matt anyway  orion im just saying  sam its a strategy 
none	 boner  liam its a strategy chub all right  taliesin im still weirded out  marisha youve got to give context to those things man  liam its an odd choice of words but now 30 seconds later i see what you mean  orion sorry her brain thats what im talking about  matt asum says my getting to wildemount is not easy nor is it safe i cannot linger for long  maybe a few days  taliesin how soon will you return  matt that depends on if i even return every spy ive sent to 
none	 seek information on the briarwoods or  to whitestone has not come back  orion ripping noises ill give him two strips of scroll of telescription if any harm falls upon  you write on this i explain what it does  matt okay how many of those do you have left by the way  orion i have 30 tickets left so 28 now  liam i have another idea uriel said that he was resistant but he said that he would bring me in  to have his people check me out check out my story what if 
none	 keyleth and scanlan rode in my  pockets  sam im not that small  laura as roaches  liam youre pretty small just as mice  laura or bugs rolypolies  liam magic users choice can you cast magic when youre transformed  sam no  laura so theyd have to pop out can you shrink yourself and still do magic teenytiny  sam are you asking me  laura either of you  sam no but i can shit on things yes  orion can you give the seeker an inspiration before he goes on an adventure  
none	 sam it could last him 20 minutes yes get him to the docks maybe  laura seeker what do you think what was your goal of coming here  travis yeah do you want us to come with you or what  matt my journey requires the utmost of silence speed stealth and i mean no offense to your  entourage but i think i can do this alone and should however this journey may take me two  weeks a month many months i do not know im doing this just in case whatever youre choosing  to do 
none	 fails at least if vox machina falls in this i can come back with proof enough to try and  once the army has been gathered perhaps we can rally all of emon against whitestone  travis if you die can you write a letter and sign your name saying that we were right you were  wrong you were full of shit the briarwoods are assholes  orion but a lot more eloquently than that  travis or not  matt i can try my best  laura that would be lovely  marisha i go up to his 
none	 arm and i druidcraft a wooden armband make it look cool and put that on  him  sam onto tiberius  marisha no onto asum  now i can scry through that that way i can at least check in on you every once in a while  if youre okay with that  sam i couldve shat on him and had the same effect  matt make a persuasion roll  laura what about being invisible can you cast spells while youre invisible  orion only with greater invisibility you can  marisha 21  sam weve always 
town	 sought out the path of the most glory and i think that that is the briarwoods  going into a giant vampirelichridden castle and killing two evil bastards amid their army of  protectors is the coolest thing we could ever do  laura its superduper cool heres the thing its not going to be just two i dont think its  going to be an entire town of people that theyve controlled  sam you think we can get into sovereign uriel without anyone detecting magic on us hes got  clerics all round him  laura yeah but 
town	 seeker asum knows all the ins and outs of the palace  liam hes leaving town tomorrow  laura wed have to do it stat but he knows how to get in  marisha he did say it was an inspired idea his words  matt regardless you have to make a choice soon i cannot dillydally ill take your band yes  he takes the wooden band and puts it around his arm and says if this will put you at ease ill  take it  marisha dont worry i wont abuse it i promise could you potentially 
none	 help us with sneaking in the  castle  matt i could get you in the door but i could not escort you to that room that would put myself  in extreme danger and the entirety of our mission  laura could you distract people  matt laughs i can do that quite well yes  sam we can get there but something tells me were still going to be fighting a big fight in a  palace id rather fight that big fight in the briarwoods  liam scanlan and i are in agreement and heres the problem 
none	 if things go south in uriels palace  we are then forced to fight against people who are good and true or give up and go to jail which  sucks  sam but in the briarwoods we can kill every motherfucker in that place  orion there are a number of innocents that we need to figure out still  marisha what if we talk to allura  sam you killed an old lady  orion she attacked us and i will not back down from that decision  sam she did have an old lady smell  travis 
none	 all right can we just vote on something please since percys being ohsoquiet about all  this  marisha percy is being very quiet about this  travis are you sure you have nothing to say  laura its fucking your family its the people that attacked your family do you have no  contribution to this  taliesin i still feel i owe everybody an apology i still feel terrible about dragging you all into  this and putting you in danger  laura were choosing to do it  matt vengeance a voice whispers in your ear percy 
none	 no one hears this vengeance  taliesin if youre with me we can be prepared for them this time we know enough to prepare  ourselves we can have ourselves ready this time  orion how many days do we have i would like eight days to prepare  marisha can i see if he looks like shaken or fucked up at all  matt i mean he looks shaken and fucked up yeah hes obviously had a horrible few days  taliesin i think a week to prepare is reasonable  laura and then leave  taliesin and then 
none	 we leave we leave quietly  marisha wait were leaving to whitestone  travis and laura yes  taliesin ive been avoiding it for too long and now i know too much  liam the law of this land is compromised percival i agree with you i think this is the  right choice  travis all in favor say aye  all except orion aye  travis all opposed say nay nice  matt then it is settled ill be on my way  laura wait before you go could i talk to you  matt certainly  laura 
none	 were you going to say anything else because ill talk to you in private  matt three days and ill be off on my side of the mission very well  laura ill follow you out  matt yes and he walks out walks with you  taliesin hold on im going to hold you before you go i just wanted to say im so sorry and  thank you and thank you for doing this for me i fear my temper before this weight is lifted from  my heart i do not wish to lose myself like that 
none	 again and i am so sorry for everything ive  done  orion tiberius puts his hand on percys shoulder and go im sorry for the tragedy which is your  family and what these briarwoods have befallen to them and i will promise you i will do my best to  have you give that final blow from that barrel to the names assigned to them but now it is a far  dangerous situation as you very well know  taliesin i will do my best to maintain myself i apologize  matt and as you all scatter 
none	 percy as you walk out the same voice creeps into your ear yes  now as you step out with seeker asum who now has a bit of haste to his step arms crossed looking  around so you wish to speak with me  laura yes i do youre a ranger  matt i am  laura youre very sneaky  matt i can be  laura ive only ever seen people like thieves like my brother do things like youve done can  you teach me anything that you know to help me maybe be a little more 
none	 stealthy as well  matt sighs well go over what you know and perhaps there are a few tricks that i can teach you  in the three days i have i cant guarantee that itll be extremely changing as thats a very  short time to train over what ive learned over a lifetime but i can certainly attempt  laura i appreciate it  matt i require your concentration for those days though before i leave  laura utmost  matt all right meet me at the morrow crack of dawn ill be at the front of your 
none	 keep  laura okay  matt very well and he heads off outside of the keep the rest of you what are you doing  orion i go to my laboratory  marisha what time is it  matt about 300 400 in the afternoon now  travis that temple of sarenrae is in the city  matt its part of the keep yeah oh you mean the actual temple you went to that is inside the  city yes you can go into the city you just cant get to the cloudtop district  orion use the earring real 
none	 quick im going to write a quick letter if anybody goes shopping  let me know  matt tiberius loves shopping  laura he really really does  matt all right well go ahead and take a quick break well be back in five minutes keep it a  stringent break guys  liam so errands will happen after that break because i have some errands that i want to do  matt yes well try to keep the errands pretty concise so we can keep on schedule yeah so its  like use this break to conjecture exactly what 
none	 you want to do all right guys well see you  back here in five minutes  break  matt welcome back so to try and expedite this over the next period of time you guys want to take  to prepare what are you going to do percy  taliesin im going to finish up those things that we talked about earlier spend some time making  some ammunition and im going to attempt to build what we were talking about earlier  matt okay go ahead and make a tinkering check for your ammunition  marisha what we 
none	 were talking about can i help him with that can i assist him  matt i would say the tinkering the mechanisms involved would be so far beyond your  understanding as a druid even just metalwork in general you can cheer him on but would not be  able to assist him with it  marisha go percy go thats pretty good  taliesin 24  matt 24 okay you manage to produce 25 rounds for your pepperbox and ten rounds for the bad  news  laura ooh thats good  marisha you still have inspiration from scanlan 
none	  taliesin no i used that  matt used that to repair his pepperbox roll for the secondary construction smoke bombs  taliesin okay 11  matt 11 you take a better part of two days attempting to get these to work and most of your  materials are ruined unfortunately you manage to come out with it with and i want you to write  this down smoke bomb question mark it may function we will see upon use but you have one  at your disposal that is questionable however for the cost of the ammunition and the 
none	 cost of the  smoke bombs construction already that comes to about id say 75 gold pieces so mark that off  and youre attempting to make youre attempting to make based on what you told me an archimedes  death ray  taliesin theyre not hard i say that as like knowing my actual skill level i could make one  matt you could to be functional with the materials that are at your disposal its going to  be very large and hard to move  marisha we were talking about making it collapsible  taliesin i could 
none	 make a collapsible one where its basically a onethird dodecahedron like an  observatory  matt you spend the remainder of this week of preparation go ahead and roll your tinkering  check this is going to cost you in materials  orion wait hold on can i pause real quick you dont need to do this if you want to make more  ammo and other stuff i can do this without you making this and spending the rest of the time if  you want to make other stuff option  matt what do you want to do 
none	  taliesin storywise its more amusing  matt okay go for it all right so the actual materials for this  taliesin its copper  matt i know its copper but the actual dodecahedron thats involved the mirrors the  lenses the whole thing in order to be of the scale and quality to even make it even remotely  functional all of it for the extremely high quality and some of it custommade within  the first couple days within this with a rush order id say the total cost is going to come to  about 1200 gold 
none	 pieces  marisha ill pitch in for that how much do you have  taliesin at this point i have less than 100 gold  marisha you have less than 100 gold ill pay for it in full  orion what is the diameter of this  matt the actual focal lens is about this big the whole construct can be carried by two people  taliesin but it will fold  orion i was just going to say whats the radius of the actual things lens  matt of the lens itself this is the radius of the lens 
none	 i mean even when its collapsed it can  be carried by one person but its still a heavy mechanism  orion so its only one foot two feet three feet  matt id say its about two and a half feet in diameter  orion are you sure you want to do that  matt hes already agreed go ahead and roll  marisha why its fine this is what we were talking about  taliesin 22  matt 22 through the materials and the construct of it you get partway through the final stages of  it and 
none	 as youre tightening one of the sections all of a sudden theres a cracking sound your  whole body freezes as you glance over the lens itself has a giant crack through it  taliesin there shouldnt be a glass piece aw man  matt for the construct for this one there was a focusing lens that is part of what the initial  blast otherwise there wouldnt be a point of actually projecting a ray from  orion i thought they were all mirrors  matt theres all different sorts of construction based on this ones the one were 
none	 going on here  or if you can say the center of it is a gem but regardless the tinkering roll was not high enough  to construct the device sorry  marisha the whole things wasted can we try and repair the crack  matt its not something you can repair the entire piece is constructed from a solid piece  taliesin what could we put it on the mending wheel  matt you could attempt to  orion grunting lets see okay clicking noise  travis i want to go to the store i would like to get 
none	 a shovel and a pickaxe  orion you going to gilmores were going to gilmores too we could go together if youre  doing that  travis i dont give a fuck where we go just a shovel and a pickaxe  matt pickaxe comes to four gold pieces for the two of those you got them make a secondary  tinkering check  taliesin 22  matt 22 this time you go back and as youre tightening it the actual metal housing of the  device ends up bending in a way that both cracks the gem and causes 
none	 the frame itself to be dented to  the point where the beam will be imperfect this is a very hard thing that youve come up with in  your mind that has not been constructed before and the level of difficulty to create this is very  difficult it does not cost you additional money thanks to the mending wheel but right now the  entire device looks like to continue its going to take more time and money to construct it  taliesin sighs i can always use this for spare parts for other things  laura youre 
none	 already 1200 in how much more would you have to put in  matt id say about half the cost an additional 600  marisha and how many more days  matt two more days  marisha how many more days do we have  matt you agreed upon eight so wed be pushing about seven then  taliesin ive already built a smoke bomb and some rounds of bullets all right ill put a  little more time in this can i get some inspiration for this too if that would be  possible  liam music you mean 
none	  marisha theres nothing i can do to help him  matt unfortunately whats your intellect  marisha my intellect ive got plus three  sam singing here comes the sun  all singing its all right vocalizing  liam singing kill the vampire  marisha and taliesin come on come on  marisha percy roll come on  taliesin 23  matt working on the device a third time you get it right to the point where you think it could  work and you go to set it up and as you do you find that the light 
none	 focuses in a way that actually  slowly melts the copper on the outside of the housing of the device and it begins to melt onto  itself and you have to pull it out of the light this design is beyond your grasp right now youre  inventing something that takes quite a lot of time to eventually perfect  taliesin okay im going to put these away for a later time and if i have one more day i would  like to work on  marisha maybe a version of it that is not collapsible that we 
none	 can at least mount  taliesin weve got it taken care of  matt thats been your guys week  taliesin thats my week okay  matt okay you bought your pickaxe and your shovel cool vex what are you doing  laura im training  matt youre training okay  liam all right i want to be brief i have four things i want to do but ill be very brief i  promise okay so first thing i want to do is i think at some point i heard tiberius talking about  wooden stakes and vampires so 
none	 i want to go buy about ten wooden stakes  orion i give him extra get me 20  liam im going shopping  laura yes get me some holy arrows  liam can i get a loaner on that ive got about 230 gold  travis i thought you said you were going to be brief laughs  liam on my own  marisha i thought we got a bit of an allowance  liam its a week so i get some gold from these people and i go and i dont even know what they  said im 
town	 getting ten wooden stakes for myself  matt 20 technically because tiberius requested ten those will cost you a total of two gold  liam thats what i thought and what did you want  laura i wanted some holy arrows  matt make an investigation check  laura or holy water try to get some holy water holy oil  liam ill get to that investigation you say that is a 13  matt 13 asking around the town holy arrows that is an enchantment theyre pricey and they  dont appear to be anywhere in the major shops 
none	 even shops like gilmores that they specialize  in its usually a special ordertype thing holy water flasks can be purchased at 20 gold apiece  liam ill get to that all right so we got wood that was two gold you said all right minus two  the next thing i want to do is go to the temple of sarenrae and get my sisters holy oil for her how  much is that  matt holy oil as opposed to the holy water  liam ill take both if youve got it  matt well holy oil is 
none	 a more expensive version holy water is a oneuse holy oil can be applied  to a weapon  liam holy oil  orion how much do the stakes weigh like each stake  matt a cluster of ten if thats what you wanted would weigh about five pounds but theyre  relatively light  orion tell him that he bought me 20 more  sam tell him that he bought you  liam 40 stakes four gold totally happened then i went to the temple of sarenrae and i got two  vials of holy oil one for my 
none	 sister one for me  matt those are 100 gold apiece  liam okay got it i cant oh you gave me gold ill get four vials of that  laura yeah i gave him gold to do it  liam well work that out i promise i ask if the cleric who helped bring pike back to life is  here  matt yeah tristan is here  liam jesus how do you do that  matt because i have to  liam when i find him i say you remember my friend pike you remember me  matt 
none	 yes i inspected you is that healing well by the way he inspects the wounds on the side of  your neck  liam it is im grateful i need a keepsake of your deity  no audio  matt and he steps away goes back disappears for a minute comes back and hes holding in a chain  around his neck its seen some years of use but still clean and very well kept an identical holy  symbol of sarenrae as the one that pike keeps around her neck he hands it over and puts it over  
none	 your head may she keep you safe and bring your soul to redemption  liam it reminds me of my friend  matt as it should pats you on the cheek as it should  liam all right so chore number two down i would like to go to uriels temple and ask the guards if  anyone has seen my belt simon  matt you are stopped at the edge of the cloudtop district the guards see you as you approach and  block the doorway and say were sorry but vox machina has been given no passage into 
none	 the  cloudtop district at this time  liam i understand i dont mean to go in i understand that we caused a lot of trouble and i  am very sorry and i dont mean to be any further trouble there is a belt that i left inside  matt thats certainly unfortunate isnt it  liam have you seen a snake called simon or any snake  matt both the guards look at each other and laugh for a second piss off  liam okay chore number four  laughter  liam i go back i give everybody 
town	 their things i would like to spend the rest of the week because  i am ready hanging out across the road from the butchers house that kynan ran from and if there  are any youths his age who go there to shop i would like to ask as they leave if they have any  idea where hes gone  matt okay make a perception check  liam perception check oh thats a seven thought it was a one laughs that is a 17  matt 17 okay keeping an eye out you do eventually come across a 
none	 boy that looks about his  age late teens maybe early twenties comes by and gathers a little bit of meat and rushes off  and you stop him  liam excuse me im sorry to take you away from your day im sorry what is your name  matt jameson  liam jameson  matt yeah can i help you ive really got to get home with this  liam i understand ill just take a second of your time i owe a boy who lives here named kynan  i owe him a few silver and i want 
town	 to see that he gets it is he in town  matt make a deception check  liam ill use the meteorite thats a 15  matt 15 gives you a look over and goes im certain youve given him silver but kynans been gone  for the better part of a week  liam where would he have gone  matt i dont know he just told us all he was off to find his destiny or some sort of  bullshit like that hes always had his head in the clouds that one  liam i agree he 
none	 ever talked about where he was going how he meant to go about doing it  matt no kept to himself mostly sorry i wish i could be more of a service if i see him where  should i send him  clattering  liam i dont know who that guy is if you see him tell him that v is looking for him at  greyskull keep  matt well ill pass that along  liam thank you  matt good day and he hurries off to continue with his errand  liam are you all right old 
none	 man  travis oldman voice im fine its my knee  laughter  matt is that your last errand  liam thats it  matt scanlan  sam i go to gilmores are we near gilmores  matt yeah gilmores in the city hes not in the cloudtop so you have access to him still  sam i want to know if such a thing exists and if so how much a potion or a scroll that could  invoke either hallow or spirit guardians  taliesin say what  sam spirit guardians is four hallow is five  matt 
none	 here we go okay asking around there are no potions for it but there is a scroll of hallow  available and i will say that comes to roughly 6000 gold pieces for the scroll of hallow  marisha its how much  matt 6000 for the hallow scroll and for the spirit guardian you said it was 4thlevel  sam 4thlevel  matt that one is 2000 gold  laura what does that do  sam spirit guardians would make some beings around us  matt spirit guardians is level three actually not level four that makes it a 
none	 lot cheaper that  is 600 gold  sam it scares evil things away its like a pikey thing  laura do it  sam can i cast that if i have a scroll  matt if you have a scroll you can yeah it has a chance of failing  marisha yeah you have to have magic  sam how much did you say  matt 600 gold pieces  sam ill buy one of those  matt theres only one available so you mark that down  sam okay yes i will i would also like to find 
none	 a smithy of some sort and make me a little metal  choker of chainmail  matt okay remembering that you have spoken to karin before which is the renowned custom  blacksmith in emon you speak with her a chainmail half coif around the neck there is  relatively inexpensive its a partial piece of armor she looks at some scrap chainmail on the  side and is like id be more than happy to use that for it it shouldnt me take more than an hour  two maybe at most  laura get one for everyone  
none	 travis i think they can bite besides the neck right  laura yeah technically but still  sam laughs sure ill get eight of them or seven of them  matt okay laughs all right  sam how much are they  matt seven of those id say for the whole seven itd put you at 100 gold because its custom  orders seven of those  liam what are they  sam chainmail chokers  marisha chainmail dickies  travis oh wait do you have one more  sam and a small one for my dick  laughter  
none	 matt all righty  sam a tiny one  matt she awkwardly judges and turns that request down shes uncomfortable with that  sam then i bow and leave  matt okay so you got that yes just a second there tiberius  liam i go to gilmores glorious goods and ask at the front door if gilmore is there  matt gilmore unfortunately is in westruun currently still overseeing the construction of  his expansion there  liam understood whos the most knowledgeable person next to gilmore in this store right now  matt that would be i cant 
none	 find my updated npc sheet do you remember what her name  was  marisha sherri  matt sherri thank you i was like shelby no sherri sherri is there greeting you that would  probably be me  liam oh hi you remember me i have a very important question i wont take up much of your  time i pull out a small metal skull cap dented in a few places rusted a bit from the underdark  what can you tell me about this  matt she takes it if youre requesting identification of a magical item 
none	 that is a  service we charge  liam sis can i borrow some money  laura how much do you need  liam how much would that require  matt 125 gold pieces per enchantment identified  liam done  matt all right  laura talk her down  matt she takes it she steps inside sets it on the counter she starts going through her books  and starts looking at it and holding it for a second and doing a full inspection of it based  on the enchantment on this device its very crude in construction 
none	 and the enchantment is in an  arcane offshoot of language im not very familiar with but it appears it is a guard from some sort  of a mental influence if worn it would give you a stronger resistance against things that would  attempt to peer into your mind  liam are we talking magic  matt yes so essentially what it would do is it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws  against magic spells  liam against  matt it would give you advantage on wisdom saving throws against magical effects  liam thats 
dung	 fucking brilliant i hand her the gold and say scanlan sends his regards  matt she noticeably blushes and goes well send mine back if you wouldnt mind ive got work to  do and she rushes off  liam thank you  matt all right now tiberius  sam 16 errands  orion i only have eight just kidding no the real quick one is going to the temple of  sarenrae to pick up a canteen  matt okay did you pay for it already you paid up front okay so you get the canteen the  explanation 
none	 is the enchantment of the actual water creation itself is separate than the holy  enchantment that has been attached to it the holy enchantment is not very powerful because it is an  enchanted item how it functions is the first burst per day that you use of the water does an  additional 1d6 radiant damage thats it but any additional after that is just water basically  whatever water is immediately contained within it at the start of the day is considered blessed  once thats expelled all the rest that it creates because its pulling it 
none	 out of the  elemental plane of water thats how its continuously projecting it the rest of it runs  straight through so it doesnt have a chance to even absorb the blessing  orion gotcha okay cool second thing i drop off my swallow or ill call it the surge blade  and to have that enchanted on both ends  matt with  orion one side fire the other side water so however many mages i have to hire for that to  happen in ten days i think we talked about it being eight days or something 
none	 like that or was  that only one side  matt laughs so what enchantment do you want do you want to just do an additional what do you  want it to be  orion i just want it to be a magical weapon  matt just a magical weapon okay just a general plusone magical weapon okay that would take  about let me doublecheck the rarity here  sam in the meantime check out those critical role keychains available on geek and sundry  laughter  matt that would run you approximately 700 gold to create it 
none	 as a plusone magical item would take  one mage a week to do it  orion okay so ill do that  matt okay so for the week it takes you pay 700 gold pieces your quarterstaff with a  couple of daggers tied to the end is now considered a plusone magical weapon  laughter  orion i stop at gilmores and i drop off my ring of protection and pay whatever that is to add a  plusone to make it instead of a minor an actual ring of protection  matt unfortunately the thing is an 
none	 enchantment cannot be progressively enhanced you would  have to disenchant and then reenchant the entire thing  orion i thought gilmore said they could do that there before thats why i was going to cough up  the green for the gil as it were  matt no they can enchant the item with it but it would be the cost of basically reenchanting  the item  orion how much would that be  matt that would cost approximately 25000 gold pieces  sam oh jeez  matt and it would take the better part of a year 
none	 a plustwo ring of protection is a very powerful  item  sam its worth it its a good investment  matt that you even acquired one earlier was great luck  orion how about buffing the ring of source spelling  matt the ring of spell storing  sam the thing that i had that i still want that one  matt the ring of spell storing thats its enchantment there is no more powerful version of  the ring of spell storing if you wanted to attempt to do that yourself on your own time you could that 
none	  will cost you upward 60000 gold pieces and about a year  orion no not right now  laura how about we stick to the level were at  orion i didnt know all that stuff was going to be that way thats why i asked  liam how do you learn if you dont ask  matt its good to ask these things  orion laughs so okay while the days are going i want to roll for animal handling to teach  lockheed stuff which is every morning whatever  matt ill say throughout the week cause 
none	 youve taught lockheed a lot of things back to back you  cant cram everything in there in the three to four days and like you learn everything  because youve already taught lockheed one thing this week roll for a second thing you want to  teach lockheed  orion like with advantage im just having fun  matt sure ill give you advantage on that  orion thats fine thats fine ill take that thats 17  matt roll advantage go for it  orion 17  travis for the sake of brevity can i roll one beard 
none	 check  matt yeah you can roll several beard checks  travis 43  matt 43 it starts filling in  travis 81  matt nope  travis 86  liam aw come on grog  travs 16  matt 16  travis 68 19 58  matt okay so by the time the week comes to an end the other side of your beard has finally filled in and  you are back to a full beard grog  laura good job grog  matt so yeah that succeeds it takes you a few days to get it though 
none	 but what do you want to  teach lockheed  orion i want to teach him to be quiet  matt a very important thing to teach a creature so lockheed has learned to be quiet good anything  else  orion yes i got that that throughout the days im going to go all the shops and see how many  glass mirrors im looking for mirrors just all kinds of mirrors every size  matt there are plenty of mirrors out there there are general stores that sell them all over  orion im looking for fivebyfive to 
none	 tenbyten size mirrors  sam feet  orion yeah no inches  matt okay i misunderstood yeah you couldve had them custom made if they werent out there  but they have mirrors of that size available  orion i need about 1500 of them can i get 1500 how many can i get  matt there arent that many mirrors in the city  orion okay all of them  sam you know if you hold two next to each other there looks like theres a million of them  orion you know what thats true  matt theyre 
none	 five gold apiece and of what is currently available for purchase you may be able  to acquire about 35 mirrors and youll clean out most of the places that will stop selling them to  you  liam thats cuttingedge technology in this day and age  orion how many if i laid them out on a flat surface how many laughs how many feet would  that cover  liam well two per foot tibs theyre five inches apiece right you can fit two in a foot  so you just bought 35 so thats about  laura 
none	 17 feet 17 whole feet of mirrors  sam if youre doing a square its three feet by three feet  matt yeah four by four so there you go four by four  orion ill take all that how much is that  matt okay 35 times five so were looking at 175 gold  orion done and then for timeline stuff im going to do as much as i can to start enchanting  my bolts and im going to go work with keyleth on stuff  matt keyleths been working with percy this whole time  marisha 
none	 the whole time  matt its taken the entire week for him you said you were assisting him  marisha no you said i couldnt assist him i had no intelligence to assist him  matt i thought you said you were still going to help cheer him on okay then no worries then yeah  youre available  orion im going to try to make as many sleep bolts as i can but the other thing with keyleth is i  would like to enchant a bolt that is a smoke screen but it consists of holy water so 
none	 i use a  pour of the day from the canteen and use that as a mist instead of a smoke  matt the enchantment of an arrow to do that is the use of a fog spell there is no way to infuse  a fog spell with holy water  marisha thats what i was saying i dont know if you can do holy water i can do a fog spell  orion can we infuse a fog spell with a sleep spell  matt no  orion can we try super hard  matt sure make a 
none	 roll  orion god damn it okay  marisha like the best i could possibly do is maybe take one of these holy water things  orion what am i rolling  matt plus arcana  travis do you think it matters no  orion 24  matt 24 okay after spending approximately 500 gold in materials the enchantment fails both  spells fizzled you lost 500 gold but now you know probably cant combine two spells into a  single enchantment  liam and knowing is half the battle  orion dont worry it came out of my pocket 
none	  sam ive got fog  orion okay  travis how about you get nothing else and we move on  orion last thing  travis no last thing  orion i stop at alluras  matt you go towards the cloudtop district and the guards stop you again  orion i remember that as i walk up and i go back to greyskull keep  matt all right  marisha oh wait i dont do that  orion oh wait i dont do that  marisha orionacaba  orion i realize what im doing and i stop  liam 
none	 also this will just take ten seconds at some point in the week when keyleth is taking a  walk i go into her garden and i clip one flower and i take it  matt how many sleep bolts  liam go sleep in your money  orion you said i could do that  taliesin youre busy this week  sam can he get back to the keep and weve all left four days ago  laughter  orion carrying groceries in look guys hoagie stuff  sam dear tiberius we left  laura we got really bored 
none	 and we left  matt okay i will say for each arrow it will cost you 600 gold and will take you six days to  do per arrow  laura six days per arrow  matt yes its one day per 100 gold of an enchantment which is even me making it higher  than the book says it should take you four times that  orion cool can it cost more if i hire a mage  laura screams  matt you want to hire a mage  marisha i need to do shit too i cant be 
none	 everyones bitch  matt so three and a half days and it cost you 1200 gold for a single sleep bolt  orion sweet and i do two of those and im broke  liam hes spent people hes spent  matt okay so youve done all of your shopping in one day and spent the rest of the week  doing those all right so there we go youre broke and you have two sleep bolts on your person  keyleth  marisha i got to gilmores and i buy an alchemy set  matt okay that comes to 
none	  sam 95000 gold  orion its going to be a lot more than you think apparently  matt alchemist supplies 50 gold  orion oh come on  matt not enchanted yo its magic give me all the magic  taliesin this is made of things  marisha this is made of things and then i go home and i make a few cure wounds potions try it  out since ive learned and ive been studying and ive been doing my research so maybe a few level  two level three cure wounds potions  matt a level 
none	 two healing potion a greater healing potion the materials involved in creating  that will come to id say about 400 apiece and youd have time to create two its about four  days per potion  sam whispered how much do they cost  matt to purchase they cost about 500 to 600 shes getting a discount because shes making it  herself  marisha wait they cost 500 to 600 and they cost 400 for me to make them  matt yes its your first time doing it theyll probably get cheaper over time as you get better 
none	  at it  marisha oh okay cheaper over time as i get better at it thats funsies well let me make  what is that a greater healing potion  matt its a greater healing so for each one you make roll a d20 and add five  marisha let me make one for right now  matt okay  marisha thats an 18 thats pretty good  matt then yeah you successfully create the potion no issue  marisha awesome i had a percyroll and he hates me for it how long will it take me to make 
none	 a  daylight scroll  matt a daylight scroll what level spell is that  marisha third  matt third thatll cost you about id say 600 gold pieces itll take you six days you dont  have time you could pay more to have somebody else help you make one if you wanted to  marisha then i make two greater healing potions actually no i want to experiment i want to take  one of those holy water bottles and i want to see if i can enchant it with my fog spell to make it a  
none	 holy water fog grenade when you throw it itll go shatters with my fog spell  matt you know that upon throwing the holy water it would shatter it would create a fog but the  holy water itself would just affect the creature you threw it at youd be able to blend the two  enchantments they dont necessarily mix the fog itself is not created from the water its created  from the glass that youre enchanting  laura plus we didnt get any holy water we only got holy oil to put on our weapons  matt 
none	 you have a couple of flasks of holy water  marisha what if i enchant it with daylight oh wait it still wont  matt its a whole different thing daylight thats more of a scroll thing  marisha im going to do it anyway im going to do the fog thing because i said it im going to  commit  matt okay that will cost you ill put it at 500 gold pieces and thatll take you five days  orion for a fog scroll  marisha no for the fog holy water thing its a holy smoke 
none	 grenade  liam someday we will get out of the character creation menu but not this day  taliesin i dont like the nose yet its too low  marisha sure thatll be my two things i do  matt okay roll another d20 plus five  marisha natural 20  matt all right you feel the fog enchantment take shape in the glass vial it seems relatively  unstable you gather that this glass was not meant to contain an enchantment from the getgo you  somehow manage to make it function but you have to be very careful 
none	 with that vial  orion here put it in here  matt who knows whatll happen if it actually is thrown  laura dont put it in a bag of holding  liam give it to scanlan  marisha who would like a very unstable item  laura percys used to unstable things  marisha i give it to scanlan  taliesin was that a jab at my no never mind  matt its a fogenchanted vial of holy water you can write it down that way if youd like  sam ill just put it on my back ill 
none	 just hang it  marisha please be careful wait i tell him scanlan this is very delicate please be very  gentle with this  sam i will put it where i put all gentle things  marisha that i trust i trust that more fine good  orion you do not make the wisest decisions here your majesty i must say  matt what was once holy  laughter  matt all right  taliesin oh god  sam i give everyone the chainmail  matt okay you give all the chainmail  laura oh look at this so 
none	 fancy  sam i take that fancy box i bought a couple times ago and i take the blue crystal that we found in  our very first adventure and i put it in and i seal it tight shit i had one more thing i wanted  to do oh yes i drink my shitscrying potion shit in a jar and leave it in the kitchen and  tell the help dont touch it  matt okay laughs it takes much convincing but nevertheless they acquiesce to your request being  the boss all right anything else  taliesin 
none	 yeah just going to let the guards know to watch our guest while were away keep him  under protection  travis are we leaving him here  taliesin i think so  laura oh god  matt the what  orion the guy who built stuff regardless did i do that or is that just in my head  matt lord daxio you mean what about him  orion so i didnt do that yet  travis yeah you going to do something on his room keyleth  laura i go find jarett and i give him 200 gold 
none	 and i say do not let desmond leave your side  watch him watch for invisible anything protect him with everything you can  matt i will do this with my life do not worry  sam have we given them a raise  laura i just gave him 200 fucking gold  travis double the guard on him  laura and yeah everybody fuck i give a hundred  sam five of them make 100 a month two of them make 50 a month  laura i give another 200 to him and tell him to pass it out 
none	 to the rest of the guard well be  back soon  matt very generous and i think theyll be very happy to find this thank you very much  laura and add another guard to the watch  travis two to desmond at all times  matt very well i will do this thank you  laura thank you  orion i going to tell erwen to go and ask for court for the lord that can construct and tell him  that we would like to make some changes and have the cells converted into barracks for our 
none	  soldiers  sam that wont do anything  orion thats what i do thats what tiberius does  matt okay erwen goes all right sir and he wanders off  orion getting a good reputation does not mean holding prison cells  matt about an hour later erwen returns and says im sorry they would not allow me into the central  district i do not have the proper papers to pass within i mentioned that i worked for you and  they told me i was not to enter  orion oh maybe you should have said a 
none	 different name  sam they would have known when they got to our keep  orion thats true laughs  laura shall we head out  taliesin yes  laura did i learn anything from seeker asum  matt go ahead and roll a d20 adding your wisdom modifier  laura ah jeez really  liam come on laura  laura what if i roll like shit  liam then itll be hilarious roll that die come on roll high and it will be amazing  matt make it with advantage because asum is a very good teacher  laura 
none	 he is hes so good  sam hes awesome  laura fake crying no that was terrible  marisha advantage  liam you are playing dnd right now all right  laura plus my wisdom 17  matt 17 okay  liam is she an emperor now  matt laughs is that how this works all right so talking with asum he works with you for a bit  and teaches you the ranger ability skirmishers stealth  sam skirmishers stealth  matt so if you start one of your turns hidden from a creature you can then as a 
none	 bonus action  at the end of your turn make another stealth check to remain hidden from them you essentially  can dive between areas and still be hidden  laura while im attacking  liam thats all ranger stuff  laura cool  liam and sam air horn noises  matt so yeah well go over the details of it after the game essentially you learn a new  ranger ability from seeker asum  marisha dope  liam wow i bought some sticks  matt all right  orion at the end of the first day before all 
none	 of that stuff happens sorry guys this is  necessary  travis is it  liam everybody shut up and let grog go on a one man solo kill spree  travis its bound to happen hes going to secede  matt tiberius what do you want to do  orion im in my lab the first night and i write a scroll of telescription to my father and i go  dear father and i tell him about the circumstances  with the vampires  laura dear diary sorry  orion at the end of it i go i 
town	 invoke the ambassadors right of war time as of now and  moreover as your son when i provide concrete evidence you will know but in the meantime i  would have you gather 50 ground troops of the draconian knights and 50 winged soldiers of the  wyvern fleet have them at the ready for my signal i know it will take you a few days of  travel to get here but this is a town of vampires and possibly liches which you know need to be  destroyed no matter what your son with love tiberius  
none	 matt all right  laura everyone is aware that tiberius is the giant eagles in lord of the rings tiberius can  invoke ultimate destruction at the call of whatever he wants  orion i dont know whats going on over there  matt all right as the week comes to a close eventually a note appears before you tiberius  within your magical room fluttering it reads tiberius child i understand your request  however you are fresh to these political matters and as the young one prone to jump at the sight of  a shadow i would 
none	 need some very heavy proof to invoke wartime which if i might add is not your  jurisdiction but my own should you wish to bring this to my attention you are welcome to but you  have but one chance before i set aside this intrusion to my work time as mere poppycock  laughter  matt tiberius i trust that in time you will prove yourself to this family and to this country  but for the time being business matters of this larger scale are best left to those with  experience with love kruvanis stormwind  
none	 liam whispers send him three more letters  orion damn it have to provide proof to my fucking father fine he didnt say no which is  what he always says which is a lot better than what he always says  sam i walk into tiberius room while hes having this conversation with himself and i say what  are you doing in here  orion im talking to myself scanlan  sam oh okay all right im going to go get some garlic from the kitchen and then lets go  laura i write a note address it 
none	 to uriel hand it to our main butler who i know his name  matt erwen  laura erwen it basically says uriel fyi we didnt totally flee wes looking for evidence  no we didnt flee well be back how about that well be back  matt all right the note is left with erwen  laura and i tell him only give this to anybody if they come looking for us and theyre angry  matt yes of course of course  marisha grog do you think i should do the whole elemental guardian thing  travis why 
none	 not  marisha all right  orion how are you doing grog  travis im fucking bored  laughter  travis ive been sitting here for 30 fucking minutes im bored cast an elemental and make it  smash everything around the keep  marisha give me that ruby ting i catch it water elemental seems appropriate based on our  knowledge yeah water elemental and planar binding and i talk to him in my elemental speech  which i can do  taliesin and you say gargles water during marishas speech  marisha and i say look were going 
none	 to be gone for 30 days we have a visitor here make sure  nothing or no one brings him any harm  laughter  matt i dont have a drink  orion that make you thirsty  taliesin you know you can speak english you dont have to  matt yeah the elemental gives you an acknowledgment and speaks back in its own tongue the equivalent  of for my time here i serve  marisha wait what im sorry  matt for my time here i serve is essentially the essence of what you get from him  
none	 marisha for my time here i serve  matt for my time here i serve all right  sam onward  liam i love doing this show  laughter  sam do we know where were going  taliesin yeah i know where were going  liam percival de rolo knows where were going to go  taliesin we head to turst fields  marisha are we riding there by horseback is that what were doing  sam do we know where were going  matt well percy said the turst fields the turst fields you do know some of 
none	 you may have passed by  them they are to the east northeast area of westruun on the eastern side of the continent  its about four and a half days travel horseback  travis what if we purchased a carriage  orion what if we went on airship instead we have one at our disposal do we not  marisha well we had one at our disposal when we were friends of the city  laura i think its in the cloudtop district actually  liam i think we need to go on the downlow  marisha yeah lets 
none	 not tell anybody that were leaving  sam carriage lets go how much do they cost  marisha do we need a carriage we have a stable full of horses  liam rein it in were going to fight vampires  matt you have four horses and you technically have the teleportation sigil for westruun  laura oh yeah  orion is briarwood keep over there  matt westruuns most of the way across the continent its about a days ride out from  westruun  marisha so that would shave time  matt it would shave about three days 
none	 off your journey  liam matt im pretty sure its sigoogle  taliesin turst fields is just northeast of westruun  laura lets do it  liam whats in those fields  matt the turst fields are a farming community that takes care of a lot of the eastern side  theyre not really an extension of westruun but its one of the closest cities and they do a lot  of food trade up into whitestone or did previously  taliesin its where we would make our camp  marisha lets head there and make camp and maybe talk 
none	 about a plan  liam yes i think percival youre leading the way use my sister as an advisor but youre  leading the way right now  taliesin im going to draw out a crude map while we make our way so i can let you all know where  were going  orion well then join me in my laboratory everyone  sam all right yes we go to tiberiuss laboratory  matt okay tiberius you go ahead and cast teleportation circle  orion not yet i go hey look at the laboratory guys what do you think 
none	 scanlan it looks like  youre impressed  sam dryly oh im very impressed  matt now you cast circle of teleportation  orion i use my sigil there i got it set up there  matt yep and the circle appears you guys rush through it you do not have your horses with you  because they would not be able to travel through the teleportation circle with you however you  could probably procure some while youre in westruun in doing that you guys for the case of  brevity on this weve been missing that for a 
none	 lot of this session  liam lets do this in real time  matt well say the total gold to purchase horses for the whole party  laura after i haggled because lets be honest i wouldve  matt you wouldve go ahead and make a persuasion roll  travis you wouldve  orion even in real time  marisha do it  laura 21  matt 21 okay yeah would put you at about well say because you are renowned in this area  and youve helped westruun helped them during the winters crest festival the year before using 
none	  that discount you manage to procure everyones horses including your warhorse for 210 gold  which is a pretty decent discount  laura yes it is all right  taliesin can i share my map  matt you can yeah  laura gasps you made a map  sam you drew that just now  taliesin you know ive forged all of our documents you are aware of that right any time  weve needed papers  laura wait where is westruun oh theres westruun thats where we are right now so we  have to go i just 
none	 spit on your map percy up through the woods into the mountains whitestone  is mountains  liam you can handle that  laura yeah i can handle both  travis were here and weve got to go here  laura right  sam lets set out  matt you have two paths you have the path into the center of the parchwood woods that leads up  into the valley of the alabaster sierras that surround it that is the direct route to  whitestone that leads through the main pathway the forest to the front of the city 
none	 theres also  the alabaster sierras themselves which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part  of the continent they are very tall fjordlike craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along  the edge theyre a little more treacherous but a little more out of the way a backdoor route so  you guys choose which route you want to take  taliesin i would prefer not the direct route  orion always go in the backdoor  taliesin can you say that anything that is not laced with sexual innuendo  laura mountain ranges are part 
none	 of my favored terrain we dont get disadvantage traveling  through  taliesin i would prefer taking that direction i dont want to head straight towards them  laura there probably will be mountain giants though remember that throw boulders and they  will be terrible  taliesin the parchwood forests are dangerous as they are theres really no safe way  sam i trust percy whatever you say  matt percy you are aware that here have been problems in the past with various mountainfaring  giants that lived north of whitestone that occasionally would wander too far south 
none	 they  mostly kept to themselves but occasionally they had some crossover there were some scuffles here  and there so you guys are deciding to take the alabaster sierras  laura yes i want to cast pass without a trace on everyone  matt you guys head out from westruun it takes about a days worth of travel you stop in the  turst fields its a small farming community you ask around for a bit most of the folks there say  that they havent had much trade or communication with whitestone like they used to they do 
none	 still  provide crops and such but they dont allow anyone past into the actual forest they trade at  the boundary created by the forest still pay gold but it seems to be more enclosed scenario  but very few folks there seem to question it business as usual is still left within turst  fields  make your way northward to the bottom of the alabaster sierras and as you begin heading up the  outskirts of this mountain range you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude  theres a perpetual climb at nearly 
none	 a 40degree angle as you continue upward further and further  and further the dropoff at the edge of the cliff is 1000 to 2000 feet at times straight down  into the ocean or rocks below there are paths worn up here it has been used as travel before  although youre uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed occasionally the wind  picks up and you have to steel yourself push yourself against the side the path thankfully  is maybe 15 20 sometimes 30 feet in width its not too much where youre being 
none	 forced against the  edge but its enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance  you guys are heading up id say about half a days travel its about 200 in the afternoon  also you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom a few bits of  stone that jut out from the side you can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on  those side areas the rock itself of this mountain range is unusually unnaturally white the actual  rock that forms this entire 
town	 region is almost a glowing quartzlike texture there are parts that  are almost translucent there are parts that are very milky white number one you can now  understand as to partially why the area is called whitestone the town nearby and youve heard  mention from percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses  and export it throughout all of taldorei thats where a large portion of the town was built around  that trade at the beginning of its construction  eventually you come to a point where 
none	 there is a falloff on the path where the erosion or some  sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth  fall down the side there is no way across other than a large sea salt airrotted rope bridge that  goes across about a hundred feet you see it rocking creaking with the wind  travis i dont think this looks very stable  laura man you know what i would give for a flying fucking carpet right now  sam so the bridge is out 
none	  matt no the bridge can be crossed it looks a little rickety its not terrible or frightening  but its been there for a while and you can tell from the color of the rope  sam how far is it across  matt a hundred feet  orion should i go first everyone  taliesin i want to inspect it from an engineering perspective if thats possible  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin ten  matt okay looking at it i mean the anchors are pretty solid in the stonework theres no  
none	 looseness to their element the rope itself is taut and seems to have serviced long enough there  are no signs of extreme wear other than just time and weather  liam im going to walk forward  laura im going to tie the fucking rope around your waist before you do that  taliesin thats quite a good idea  liam sarenrae jeepers im going to use perception im going to look at it before going  out that is a 23  matt all right are you taking your horse with you  liam i leave my horse 
none	 with my sister im on foot im on all fours really spidering out  matt making your way across you get halfway across the bridge theres a creaking sound and slight  movement as the wind picks up at times and you creaking  liam so im lasting what would i make is it an insight check to decide if i thought grog could  make it across this thing  matt make an intelligence check roll and add your intelligence modifier  taliesin its a ten  liam take that zero off it and youve got it  matt 
none	 best you can tell grog looks like a big guy  liam this is fun you swing back and forth grog i think you might like this  marisha how far across is the bridge a hundred feet  taliesin once youre across lets secure the rope thats attached to you and well make  ourselves a guideline that we can hang onto  laura i like it  liam all right he sounds like a debbie downer grog but ill go across and you can follow  matt okay you make the rest of your way across no issue 
dung	 the rope bridge carries your weight all  the way  laura tie a rope i tie the other side  liam is there anything on the other side i could tie it to  matt theres a couple of small cliffside trees that grow off in strange twisting bonsai treelike  branches that stick off theyre pretty sturdy  liam i use a sailor knot  laura i use a special ranger knot thats really extra strong  matt secret ranger knot well played  laughter  matt whos up next  liam i doubleknot mine  sam weve 
none	 got to get the horses across  travis no they aint coming  sam theyre not coming oh well i just dimension door across then  liam jeepers will you warn a halfelf when youre going to do that  matt spooks you for a second you hold on and you make your way across you guys  are now on the other side youre holding onto everyones horses left behind  laura trinket  travis i tie up all the horses to a very large tree  marisha are we going by foot now  laura looks like it 
none	 tiberius are you still on our side are you with me still will you cast  fly on trinket i love you  orion sure to make it across  laura i can climb on him and you cast fly and you only have to use one little spell  orion if i cast it on him i would probably jump on myself because im a little bit heavier than you  are darling  laura then do it  liam shes haggling you right now  orion you can have him afterwards  laura yeah you can go and 
none	 ill just use the little rope  orion fine proceed  matt you cast fly on trinket  orion no i dont i dont do shit yet i wait for you guys to get across so if something  happens then i can cast it  laura okay just protect him  matt so you get on trinkets back  laura no he hasnt cast it on him yet  matt so whos going across now  laura i am  matt okay you make it across no problem youre light enough and able to guide the movement of the 
none	  bridge  laura good thing i only had one frittata the other day  marisha heres my question what looks shaky the connection of the bridge or the actual physical  condition of the bridge itself  matt the physical condition of the bridge there is no actual visible point that is  marisha for bonus added safety in case this bridge gives way im going to cast grasping vine  and have it loop and wrap around the edge of the bridge further enforce it  matt the vines reach around and wrap around the edges of the 
none	 wood slats and the rope handholds  and it seems to be pretty wellheld on that side  taliesin clever  marisha at least that side will be fine and then ill go across  matt cool you make it across without a problem  travis who else needs to go across  laura just you and tiberius and trinket  travis you want me to go first  orion its fine i hop on trinket and i pet lockheed and then i hop on trinket and i cast fly  on him and say remember how to go across 
none	  and then as we start flying  across i cast telekinesis on grog and take him with me kind of like green lantern  marisha concentration spells  orion yeah that should be 12 seconds to get across a bridge right  matt yeah that would be 12 seconds which will be enough time so as youre coasting over with  trinket floating bear sounds you turn around and cast telekinesis grog all of a sudden  youre lifted up and held aloft you look down over yourself waving your hands instinctually  looking down you can see a 
none	 600 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably  splinter or crush anyone who fell into it and then is pushed out to the ocean so its a little  scary but you start flailing about as youre being pulled across by tiberius eventually  trinket comes lands on the other side safely you guide grog over down onto his feet safe and  sound  marisha whos left  sam no one the horses  laura oh yeah what do you want to do with the horses  travis we tied them up 
none	  orion im going to dispel the fly but im going to hold the telekinesis for the ten minutes i can  on grog im not going to do anything im just going to keep that spell going  matt okay cool all righty  sam i say a prayer of thanks to the horses who will surely die of starvation  laura they were tied up in a super grassy area with a shitton of water around  liam theyll be eaten by something long before that its fine  marisha so whats our plan what are we doing 
none	  sam the plan is walk until we get there  matt the path pinches a little bit tighter as you go across about a ten foot width and you guys  begin pulling across theres a sudden large gust of sea air blows in as you guys go ahead and  buckle down to hold on id like you all to roll an athletics check  laura are we in mountains yet so i have advantage  matt you have advantage on it  travis me too because mountains are my favorite  matt thats true yeah  laura 
none	 what is this acrobatics  sam and laura athletics  sam nine  orion 18  marisha 19  taliesin ten  laura 11  travis 23  matt all right as you guys are holding tight both scanlan and vax are trying to grab something  holding onto rocks but before they can get enough theyre both so small it pushes them  out  orion how much time has passed  matt its three seconds oh passed since the bridge about five six minutes  orion can i try to catch them because i still have the telekinesis 
none	 going  matt you can catch one of them  orion yelling why matthew  matt because the spell has to be directed  marisha are they flying off a cliff  matt theyre both being dragged by the wind off the side of the cliff you can see them grabbing  the ground vax is being pulled off the side as scanlan is actually lifted off his feet  orion i know vax cant i grab vax  liam tell my sister i love her  travis i jump and try and grab vex  laura vax you want 
none	 to hold me  liam im vox  orion wait youre grabbing him  laura im vex  travis thats what i said  matt you grab vax and hold him in place as you reach out and grab vax by the arms and pull him  back onto  liam wait who  orion you  liam oh he grabs me  travis i grab her  laura grog grabbed me  matt you were fine  laura i know but he still said hed grabbed me  matt okay then youre being held aloft by tiberius telekinesis concentrating 
none	 scanlan has  fallen out of view  marisha i grasping vine him before he goes out of view  matt okay its all right  marisha off the side of the cliff  matt go ahead and make an attack roll with your grasping vine  orion i can manipulate a thousand pounds  liam youve got me  marisha what  matt this is to aim the vine as he falls  marisha 19  matt 19 not a problem the vine grabs scanlan and pulls him back and holds him as the wind  slowly dies down 
none	  orion i guide vax back to the cliff  matt the wind dies down you guys now begin pushing yourselves close to the edge of this  pathway up the side of this seaside cliff it doesnt seem to deviate much beyond that 15foot  width now which puts you all at general unease as the suns getting closer and closer to setting  youre making your way around the crest youve been traveling this mountain range for a good  number of hours now youre at a decent height youre on foot a good distance inside the  
none	 alabaster sierra mountain range perception check everyone  taliesin yeah  travis five  sam four  matt three two one  marisha 25  taliesin 26  liam 29  laura 25  orion i rolled a natural one with negative two  matt okay those of you with a higher perception than 20 on this roll as you pull along you hear  this echoing sound this birdlike sounds in the distance the winds carrying it as its blowing  past you  marisha does it sounds like anything naturebased something i could possibly have  talked to 
none	 in the past  taliesin is it something i would know  matt go ahead and make an intelligence check you go ahead and make a nature check  taliesin 21  marisha 25  matt it is birdish in nature but it sounds too guttural and too articulate to be a bird there is  enough of you notice theres a language of the chittering that is birdlike but there is actual  voice you recall that there are various creatures that make the cliffsides home one of the ones  that are more obnoxious that some of the 
dung	 earlier traders of whitestone had problems with making  this path for mining were clusters of harpies  marisha oh fucking harpies  taliesin and orion harpies  orion theyre the opposite of the harpers which are good  travis whats a harpy  orion a harpys a jerk a stupid butthole whos super loud  matt you glance over as you guys are having this conversation behind you you can see in the  distance from where you were a couple of these dark shapes swooping down you see a cluster of  about four or five of these 
none	 harpies diving  taliesin can we find a place to maybe settle down  laura can we stealth i cast pass without a trace on us  sam dont worry i can make us all look like cows again  marisha shushes everyone be quiet  matt how long is the concentration on pass without a trace how long can you hold that  concentration  laura up to one hour  matt okay it has faded since then  marisha where are we against the mountain are we still on the mountain edge  matt yeah youre still on 
dung	 the path and you look back from where you came from  marisha so we have a mountain behind our backs  matt yeah a sheer cliff  marisha i turn around and i cast move earth my 6thlevel fucker and i boof and i clear out a  cave  matt okay as youre concentrating on this eventually keyleth begins to focus and over the  next minute or so she begins to push a cavern  laura i cast pass without a trace on us now  matt okay as this is happening you can see the harpies 
dung	 have definitely found some sort of prey  theyre distracted as theyre slowly tearing apart what you gather are the horses you left behind  laura oh no terrible  matt yeah good news is theyre distracted  marisha horses saved our lives guys  matt bad news is theyre probably not going to be there when you come back  taliesin its getting dark i think we should camp  liam so youre saying theres a chance  matt over the next few minutes or so keyleth youve pushed a good ten by 15foot cavern into  the side 
none	 of this wall that didnt previously exist you guys are able to step out of the light  as the suns starting to disappear over the mountain range the cliffkeep which you can see  in the distance across this channel now theres a channel of water between the two  marisha i go ahead and druidcraft a little campfire tiberius you want to light a fire for  us  laura im going to use hide in plain sight im going to see if i can do this that sort of  ability to camouflage the opening of the 
dung	 cave to where they wouldnt be able to see it  matt sure go ahead and make a stealth check  laura 28  matt okay you take the next 15 minutes or so finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks  that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes  off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that keyleth had created it takes a  little ingenuity because its just a rock opening and there isnt a whole lot of brush and things  
none	 around but you feel youve managed to mask it to the point that to a distant eye it would be hard  to see that there is an actual cavern there at this point the sun has set night has come in  and you guys are sitting within this cavern hearing the distant sound of the ocean waves  crashing against the bottom of these cliffside coastal fjords  marisha me and tiberius made a fire  matt all right a fire is made  orion i lit it with my spitting  matt okay tiberius forms a relatively 
dung	 useful and effective campfire within this cave  laura oh i want to use my holy oil and dip a couple arrows in the holy oil because i know i can  make three based on what weve done before  matt you can yes do be aware the holy oil will only last about a day  laura oh really oh so ill do that right before  matt its one of those things where if you dip it now and leave it over time itll just either  evaporate or drip off of the arrow  laura good 
none	 to know  liam while my sisters looking at her shit i bogart trinket and climb up onto him use him like a  sleeping bag and cuddle into his softest warm parts and fall asleep  matt bear groaning trinket at first just haplessly pushes you away but recognizes your  scent and lets you  laura you ganked my sleeping bag  liam sorry not sorry  orion i find a little patch of dust and do a little dust bath real quick and then im going to  use one of my books of stuffs and start 
town	 researching liches just because i want to  matt okay i mean what book would you be researching this in  orion tobins spirit guide  matt the researcher ability is that you can go to places of research and find books you dont  really keep a tome of all knowledge with you the next time you find a town or youre in town then you  can use that ability to research in advance  laura i ask grog how hes doing  travis im bored as shit  laura you want to arm wrestle  travis no 
none	  laura all right  sam come on do it grog come on you cant beat a girl  matt do you guys all rest for the evening  laura and liam yeah  laura but we should take watch  taliesin im still awake im going to fall asleep last  marisha i also stay up with percy  matt okay  sam ill take first watch  laura wake me up when youre tired  orion im gonna feed lockheed some treats  matt okay you guys continue your business for the evening  marisha i talk to 
none	 percy for a second percy while were alone for a moment theres something  thats been bothering me and i cant get it out of my head i thought id talk to you about it  because i feel were friends right were friends are we friends  taliesin sure id like to think so yes  marisha been through a lot been together a while  taliesin its been a while yes  marisha two years now  taliesin i suppose  sam i go invisible to see if i can hear their conversation  matt okay go ahead 
none	 and make a perception check  sam perception or stealth 20  matt okay you are keeping relatively low and are able to overhear their conversation  marisha you know youre a very brilliant person  taliesin thank you  marisha i cant help but feel like im being watched right now never mind forget i said  anything i cant help but feel like theres something else theres something more to this  that youre not telling us and i didnt really think of anything until we were having that fight  where tiberius brutally murdered that old woman 
none	  taliesin been trying not to think about it  marisha yeah me too but the one thing that i cant get out of my head was something that you  said during that fight and for a long time i was like damn percys got really cool oneliners and  hes so smart and i wish i could have cool oneliners you and grog have really cool  oneliners and then you said your soul is now forfeit to the person you shot that night and i  thought wow that was an interesting oneliner  taliesin i did 
none	 say that didnt i  marisha yeah yeah you did for some reason i was the only one who noticed it and i dont know  if thats because im just reading into things if that was just a really awesome but scary and  brutal thing to say in the moment or if theres something deeper that you might be serving  taliesin honestly ill say ive had a number of years thinking about what i would do and what i  would say and how i would go about this this kind of obsession is not healthy and 
none	 i know that and  its no way to live and im sure that was something on the list of things i thought i would  say some attempt to be scary when i met them as opposed to being scared i think i was sighs  again i dont really remember much because i was so angry ive never been so angry and i think i  was just trying to sound threatening and id had these dreams before you know ive you dont build  anything like this without the knowledge that youre im aware that inventing this 
none	 thing has  been a mistake  marisha what thing  taliesin i pull out my gun  marisha wait what are you saying you had knowledge you didnt build that without  inspiration what do you mean  taliesin ive had thoughts about it but i didnt really think about what i was doing or what i was  going to build until i decided to take my revenge and id never thought about building it because i  realized what a dangerous idea it was sighs and i fear for the day that that comes back to haunt 
none	  me i dont know what ill do but i dont know i think i was just trying to say something to be  intimidating i honestly didnt even think i was going to kill him it just happened  marisha can i see if hes lying to me  matt go ahead and make an insight check  marisha 17  matt 17 roll a d20  taliesin is your insight really that good  marisha yeah im wise as fuck  matt and add your charisma modifier  taliesin add my charisma modifier 18  matt best you 
none	 can tell hes seeming honest and sharing openhearted to you you feel like youve  really gotten to the core truth of what percys about  marisha what what did you say  matt you feel like youve gotten to the core and truth of what percys about and perhaps your  questioning this has upset him and you feel like maybe youve pushed this a little too far  taliesin i do regret what happened and i know he was a bad man but i still hope to never lose my  temper like that again  liam got 
none	 to roleplay that shit he convinced you  marisha i still really feel like were being watched do you feel that i dont know  taliesin honestly i think we both need sleep  marisha its really distracting yeah well i love you  taliesin i love you too  marisha were in this with you until this end  taliesin thank you  marisha lets sleep  matt okay you guys through your turns the evening goes by uneventful morning comes to you  you can hear the distant caws of seagulls waking you up as the heat from 
dung	 the morning sun begins to  eventually hit this side of the cave since youre on this side of the mountain by the time you wake  up you realize the hours probably a little bit past noon  laura oh shit  marisha we overslept  orion its so dark in here because of the cave thing  marisha okay so wait percy how much further out are we from whitestone  matt you gather you probably have about a days worth of travel and youll be able to make your  way down into the ravine from here 
none	 youve come up quite a bit of the mountain range  taliesin probably another day before we can camp close enough to attack  sam lets get going  laura should we stealth through the mountains just in case they have any kind of lookouts  orion oh they will have lookouts  laura i cast pass without a trace on us again  liam lets go slower  laura should we all stealth try at least  liam yes  taliesin lets keep stealthy  matt okay you guys gather outside of the cavern and head up continuing along 
none	 this path  eventually you do notice that the path becomes broken and too steep to continue it actually  falls and tumbles down into this long sliding ravine there is a slight rockslide trail that  you could climb up and over and it looks like there is a separate ravine or a separation where  the two mountains join that could possibly be traversed but continuing on the seaside path is  not going to work it does bring you inward towards maybe a little further south than you  would have wanted to for optimal backdoor entrance 
none	 into whitestone but its about your only path  taliesin have i walked this path before i never walked this path at all  matt you would have had no reason to walk this path youve heard about it you know of this side  of the mountain range but based on your history theres no reason you would have come here  orion whatever it takes to get to that back door  matt everyone make a stealth check by the way just so were aware of what your stealth rolls are  with the pass without a trace 
none	  laura add ten to it  liam you get ten oh well i got a 40 then  matt okay  sam 27  matt 27  orion nine  matt with the ten  orion oh 19  marisha 32  taliesin 32  travis 27  laura 37  matt thats a pretty good spread so you guys youve hit the edge of the path are you heading  up the rockslide trail  laura yes  matt okay you all one by one begin to climb over the trail and some rocks tumble loose beneath  
none	 your feet grasp and you help each other get to the very top  orion i use my mage hand to help  matt laughs thats adorable  laughter  laura as he looks at the clock thats adorable  matt so you all eventually manage to make it over the top of the rockslide trail and eventually it  leads you to where these two large mountains come together and there is a small path that leads  between it winds and travels downward you can see bits of the rock have fallen and crumbled and  there are 
none	 small boulders and such that just over time and through erosion have tumbled down this  ravine to start filling it with occasional chunks of stone you begin walking through this ravine  for another good 45 minutes to an hour keeping a keen eye out  orion is this the same ravine that were travelling across  matt basically you guys have been traveling up the side of the coast youve now turned inward  over the mountain range to head down into the valley of whitestone you are currently just now  heading up through the mountain range 
none	 inwards towards the mountain  taliesin is this the river  matt theres no river here its just stone that comes together for a pathway in between this is  where two large peaks of the mountains basically come to join at the bottom  taliesin okay so were not at the river  matt no the river is actually inside the valley and to the south of whitestone so pressing down i  would like you all to roll a perception check  laura jesus  marisha ah thats all right  sam one  laura natural 20  
none	 liam natural 20  liam yeah  matt one one 20 20  orion 16  marisha 14  taliesin 16  matt okay as all of you guys are charging forward both vex and vax you hear this slight  noise of a couple rocks clattering in the ravine behind you you both turn and look and for a split  second you swear you see between some of the rocks and paths of jagged stone that mark the walls of  this ravine you see a quick blur of blue that vanishes behind a higher platform above you 
none	  liam smurfs  laura a blur of blue  matt a large blur of blue just disappears behind one of the outcroppings thats blocking your view  of higher up the ravine  laura shushes down hide  orion i cast stoneskin  matt okay  liam stealth  orion i fasten my cloak of displacement  laura and i prepare  matt you guys prepare for a second and as youre all paying attention you guys also see another  shift of blue whoosh go across the way and this time you see its something large and blue 
none	 that  moves across the stone and goes into a small cavern that looks about 25 feet up the way thats  just past your visual range from this low in the ravine  laura do we have any visual on what it could be  matt it moved very quickly and for a split second you could see it appeared to be the way  it moved was almost serpentine like whoosh and vanished inside you swear you saw limbs though  it wasnt a giant snake there was something attached to it  laura whispering wyvern i look 
none	 at keyleth keyleth louder and i whisper but for sake of  microphones do you know of a creature thats blue and fast and is kind of snakey but has arms  and legs  marisha let me think about it for a second do i know a creature thats blue and snakey  liam it sounds like basilisks but theyre too slow  matt what did you roll  marisha i dont know ooh thats 24  matt 24 youve heard of various lizardlike creatures that grow to large sizes usually those  fall into the realm of dragons 
none	 and such the color blue though is uncommon unless it were a blue  dragon however the motion of this creature does not seem to necessarily be the territory of a blue  dragon its hard to point exactly what this  is but you do know its probably something in the  serpentinetype magical realm  taliesin i heard them i heard them describe it would i know it from the description just from my  local knowledge  matt go ahead and make a history check  marisha the blue things weird the blue thing is whats throwing 
none	 me  taliesin nine  matt nine unfortunately nothing of this type has come across you if it has its been too  long and youve forgotten it there are a number of dangerous things that exist in these  mountains  laura ive got a really good idea wait no grog pick up something really heavy and throw it  as far as you can  travis i go over and i grab scanlan  sam no  laura a boulder or something  travis i put scanlan down find a large rock thats tumbled down maybe  matt 
none	 yeah theyre easy to find theres like some that are this big some that are larger  theyre really heavy  travis and i discus the thing and whoosh  matt make an athletics check  travis well that was great 24  matt whoosh you release the rock impact it skids to a halt as it does you can see suddenly  over the course whoosh something very quickly move and its a head its a snout you see its  probably a good six sevenfoot wide a giant lizardlike toothy jaw blue scales against it  with large 
none	 kind of horned ridges across the back of its head and its claws clacking on the edge  looks down looks down at the rest of you rears back  laura it saw us  liam didnt see me  orion well of course it saw us  laura with 37 stealth yo it saw us  marisha but it didnt seem to give a shit  matt it just withdrew over the edge  sam should we run  laura maybe just move really fast away from him  marisha i can i can cast antilife shell on us 
none	 then we can haul ass really fast  sam will it move with us your shell  marisha yeah as long as you stay close to me it moves with me  liam yeah fuck this thing lets get out of here  marisha okay i cast antilife shell stay close  matt okay as you begin casting and finish the spell as the sphere appears at which point you  now see a large blue blur whoosh dart off of the cliffside into the air impact noise and skidding  right in front of you guys blocking off the 
none	 side of the ravine you guys were running towards you  can now see it a huge elongated serpentine body covered in blue scales and horns you can see what  looks to be six to eight arms and a series of legs all across its long snakelike torso as it looks  it snarls at you all snarls and you see sparks of energy electricity sparking noises in its  jaw growls roars  liam salamander  matt and thats where were going it end tonight  yelling  laura oh jeez louise  sam you cant do that 
none	  matt i can because its 1030  liam no its not its like 845  matt we can keep going if you guys want to stay long its thursday night  zac im coming to you with my laptop before you continue  liam whos that guy  matt but to give you a little perspective that is what essentially youd be facing  loud reactions  laura what the fuck its got so many arms  liam thats a kobold  matt yeah totally kobold  end of transcript
