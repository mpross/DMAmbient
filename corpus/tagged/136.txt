episode  all no no no no  matt  of critical role  all cheer  opening credits  matt and welcome back so picking up where we left off this last episode vox machina had  made their way west into the ozmit sea to the islands of anamn and to the city of vesrah the  final stop in keyleths longrunning aramente to prove herself leader of her people of zephra here  they were given a /none/ task as part of the aramente where they had to retrieve three lodestones within the  rift of the water elemental plane which as of late had been taken up residence by a kraken an  ancient pet of the titans now freed and left to wander to feed grow and apparently loom across  that boundary the party went in and due to an unfortunate vomiting episode underwater drew the  attention of the kraken  laura did you plan that  sam what  laura that you were almost vomiting today and you vomited and ruined our lives /none/  sam i just plan to vomit every week at least once  matt its for the best i think however drew the attention of the kraken and a very very  intense battle ensued in which most of you managed to escape by the skin of your teeth  however in the battle vax did fall his body left cold and lifeless beneath the waters in a  lastminute urge of leadership keyleth reached out grabbed the twins and planeshifted back into  the prime material plane with percival taryon and grog looking to escape you managed to be /dung/  vomited up with apparently almost no hit points left and jumped through the portal while flicking  off the kraken as  travis doublebirds  liam badass  matt and that was where we left off so before we get into this  sam wait what theres a before  matt vax  marisha oh no  laura you  sam bastard  matt as you feel the cold waters rush around you and your vision go dark even as the  unconsciousness takes you your vision narrows and tunnels until its just nothing and while you  were /dung/ floating before the cold temperature begins to become warm its a familiar warmth and as  opposed to being in water there is no resistance you are just in a dark space you can look down  and you can now see your hands and you recall and you remember this youve been here before  this is very reminiscent of your first journey into the blood pool your first true communion  with the raven queen and the moment you make that realization as youre looking at your hands you  watch as something dull and white arises from /none/ the darkness below you and you look down and see the  massive porcelain mask of the raven queen emerge from the shadows tendrils of darkness spilling  off the edges and the corners as you watch the stone face of the raven queen rise up to meet  yours what seemed immense suddenly seems small and as the shadow pulls away you can see the  tumbles of jetblack hair falling past the shoulders the long ravenfeatherwoven  no audio  matt  gathers and then vanishes into the impossible darkness behind her the hands reach  out and /none/ take you by the sides of the head and you hear the voice once again emanating sourceless  ringing from all around you it says my champion it seems youve stepped to return to me  but what is your destined thread to be  grog as you come jumping through  the portal and turn to  flick off the kraken you watch as one of its tendrils begins to one of its final tentacles  thats still there pulls through and begins to try and grab one of the sides of  the rock lodestone pillars  travis /none/ oh no  matt the other guardians half merfolk half various individuals rush forward and begin  stabbing at it as it begins to get its beak snapping right at the interior of this portal you  see it starting to flex and the energy beginning to pulse its almost trying and force its way  through a much smaller opening percival grog taryon what are you guys doing  sam oh shit we have to do stuff  travis oh shit  taliesin im still underwater arent i  matt you all are still underwater yes  travis does /none/ this happen a lot  matt the guardians right now are just shouting and screaming and stabbing at the tentacle  travis yells a lot of that theres a lot of just openmouthed yells  matt yeah the guards like argh quick push it back theyre all stabbing it the one  tentacle finally snaps and withdraws inside  travis we could just go we could just leave its just fine its good  matt the mouth pulls back and now the whole body shifts over and you see the one giant eye from  one side of the kraken /none/ come peering through  travis yeah fuck that noise  taliesin i am dragging taryon and you if i can drag you as well were walking away  travis the eyeballs soft let me throw one more time at the eyeball yeah i throw the hammer at  the eyeball  matt okay go ahead and make an attack  travis okay reckless  matt reckless okay so you had disadvantage underwater so its just one roll  travis ah balls 23  matt thatll hit  travis nice  matt go ahead and roll damage  travis i meant /none/ twohanded oh no im throwing it  matt youre throwing it  music flares up  laura there it is  matt this connectors a little wonky  travis 21 points of damage im still enlarged right  matt you are yes  travis 25 points of damage  matt 25 whack as you release the hammer it goes thorstyle just headfirst piercing through  the water and impact sound into the open eye of the kraken as it slams shut you hear the groan  as it reels back and the voice pierces through the rift towards you and /none/ most of the people in the  vicinity one more time saying im coming soon enough and as it pulls back the remainder of  the guardians go ahead and reach over each putting hands on the lodestones and shift them  slightly in place and you watch as the rift crackles and then doesnt slam entirely shut but  the image you had of the water elemental plane suddenly grows a little more opaque and difficult  to make out the discerning details  travis did i manage to thump sound  matt yeah your hammer does return  /none/ travis oh thank god well we all give something every once in awhile  matt so as youre carrying the which you were  sam he resuscitated me i believe  matt yes  sam i have six points  matt yes so conscious horribly beaten it seems that the kraken has been beaten back and  currently the lodestones are utilized to keep the rift in check youre uncertain as to whether or  not the threat of the kraken was an idle threat or whatever else it has planned but regardless  thats the least of your worries /none/  taliesin did we all hear it  sam hear what  taliesin the kraken  travis cause he mindspeaks right  matt it wouldve been  travis it braintalks  matt it wouldve been primarily to you grog and some of the other guardians nearby  taliesin okay thats good  travis well he was not happy in the end there but he recognized true power  and he was sorry to see us go  matt as soon as youve had this conversation you turn and look to the left and you see durent there  who is /none/ waiting and goes where is the rest of them wheres the rest wheres keyleth  taliesin they they  travis they distappeared  taliesin they went away  laura laughs distappeared  matt well lets hope that they know where theyre going at the very least  any idea where they went  taliesin can we breathe some air please  matt aye aye all right follow me follow me and he starts leading the swimming cavalcade of  individuals that are leading you up to the top of vesrah back up through the aerie of torrent  through the /none/ various tubes and tunnels of the reef that leads towards the surface of the ozmit sea  simultaneously keyleth vex and the lifeless body of vax you apparate roughly ten feet above  the surface of the water on the outskirts of vesrah tumble a bit and splash into the  footandahalf shallow waters on the outskirts as you all get up for a minute and think about  your circumstance vex you look down and you see your brother facedown in the water floating  laura i flip him over and look at him vax vax wake up  /none/ marisha come on come on we have to get him out of this environment come on  laura is there a cleric on the island  marisha yes before i do anything i am going to throw up a sky write above the city  laura i start dragging his body  marisha and it says help cleric that works theyll get the idea hold on to him get on i am  going to turn into my giant raven form again  laura how big is that  marisha its like the giant eagle form i just kind of /none/ modify it for style  laura thats tight  matt okay so using the stats of a giant eagle but youre going into a raventype form  marisha yeah yeah  matt okay  marisha black feathers  travis good  marisha all that coolness yeah  travis its all about branding  marisha yeah a hundred percent  travis yep  matt okay and whatre you doing  marisha gotta be onmessage  laura where are we going  marisha i fly off towards the center of the city towards where the entrance of the portal was  cause /none/ im assuming there would be sages and clerics waiting there  matt well the portal is beneath the city  marisha i know but there is like a  matt there is the central chamber in the middle of the city which is where it seemed the base of  where the social gatherings seemed to occur and the centerpiece was where uvenda and many of the  other keepers of the city seemed to frequent  marisha ill head there  matt okay so you watch as the giant raven takes off  laura oh no im holding onto /none/ her right  marisha yeah yeah yeah  matt okay so youre holding onto her  marisha shes holding onto him and were riding there  matt okay i see i got you okay so you climb onto the back of the giant raven clutching your  brother in one arm and as the wings pick up you use all the might that you have to just hold on  youre used to flying under your own power usually not somebody elses but as the wings  take off the sea breeze thankfully is not too heavy that day and /town/ as you coast in coming down  dodging between the various buildings heading towards the central risen chamber you watch as  the upper thirdtier level of this theres a single chamber that is open and the outside wall  is a series of pillars that makes up the structure on the inside you can see it dips down  into three different sunken platforms and in the center there are a handful of small statues  theres incense being burned and what looks to be a small altar of some kind there are four figures  there inside all /none/ dressed in similar blues and greens aquas and whites most of them are just  long robes with dangling shellbased jewelry and various smoothedoff stones that have been found  tossed and rounded by the elements through the years and in the center of the chamber in the  process of lighting a few of these youre not quite sure of the material but they appear to be  candles as you see theyre being lit like candles you see uvenda is walking with her staff  taking this long burning tube and is currently setting them alight as you /none/ approach as the wings  of the raven begin to prepare for landing the wind kicks up in front and you see some of the  other guardians put their arm up and look up curiously some of them reaching back and  preparing for whatever may be there uvendas voice however rings out across the center of this  chamber and says stop stop i know this one who approaches and as they all slowly back up  uvenda stumbles upward sets aside her small handbased wick to one of the servants and  approaches the raven as you /none/ begin to slink off the side of the bird  laura please are there any clerics here  matt we do have some here of a healingbased nature yes has he been hurt  laura hes hes dead  matt she slowly approaches and reaches over and puts her hand on the forehead of vaxs corpse  runs her thumb along the cold skin indeed the kraken claims another  laura no no he wont claim him what can we do  matt the power that is at our disposal could perhaps bring him back though his form may be /none/  different than you recall  marisha i drop my form  matt all right the feathers scatter off as keyleth is now returned to her halfelf image  marisha do you have means of traveling quickly we have a friend who is a cleric can you get us  to her there and back quickly or someone who can tree stride me there and bring her back im  exhausted or else i would do it myself please please  matt i have not a means of travel but we could reach out to someone  marisha yeah yeah /none/ any  matt all right and she walks back to the altar and you can see where there are a series of  these statues theres four of them in the center and theres one large statue in the center and  the center statue it looks almost like  longpetrified reef its white its porous it looks  like the longdead reef but it seems to swirl into a treelike shape its this weird merging of  sea and forestbased imagery and as each various portion of the tree outstretches you see various  baubles are hanging from it /none/ you see stones necklaces notes uvenda sets her staff to the  side and her small slightly arched form begins to slowly crawl up the side of the tree and it looks  a bit physically arduous for her but nobody offers to help you see that this is something that shes  done often and is part of her job as the guardian here in vesrah  marisha while she does this i come over the earpiece and i say grog percy quick get back up  to the central tower quick  laura how do we even know /none/ theyre alive  marisha i am trusting that they are  matt with the distance of the earpiece you can hear them yes  taliesin were on our way  marisha oh thank god thank god is everyone still alive down there  taliesin barely yes for the moment  marisha vax is down so hurry  taliesin were on our way  matt as youre finishing the statement you watch as uvenda is climbing down with one hand and has  something cradled in her left arm as shes like grunts almost slips for a minute and sets  /none/ herself down back on both her feet and rubs her lower back youll get there one day  laura please hurry  matt and she unfurls her arm and you can see theres a conch shell a small conch shell but a  conch shell and she goes  whoever youre wishing to speak to think of  them and whisper it into the shell  marisha pike pike if you can hear me we need you now in vesrah please its vax  laura how do we know if it worked  marisha yeah i second that statement  /none/ matt shell hear you its up to her whether or not she can act and she hands the conch over to  one of the assistants takes her staff back up now we offer the service still should you not  hear anything we are more than willing to try and restore him to whatever form we can  laura how much time does how long is too long  marisha i dont want to wait too long lets just wait a little while longer and see if we hear  anything from pike shes very smart shell hear us /none/  laura i start brushing his hair off of his face  marisha while she does that i start gathering the feathers and start laying them out as a bed  around vax and preparing the station  matt okay so the scattered remnants of your transformation the raven feathers that were  shunted from your form you begin to form into a bedlike place to set his body on okay while you  guys are doing that durent finally breaks the surface of the water where you were originally  brought down into the aerie of torrent and after /none/ youve all hit the surface and breathed out the  bright midday sun is coming down the smell of sea air hits you you hear the distant cawing of  various ocean shore birds its a welcome change of pace from the murky depths of the water  elemental plane youve been facing for the past few moments as soon as you emerge durent steps  up onto the sand turns around shakes and brushes his hair off all right well thats the end of  my watch i dont know what to do  travis could you point us /none/ in the direction of where your healers would be  matt healers and he points over to the large ascending central structure in vesrah the one  above where you guys had dinner the night before thats your best bet there thats where uvenda  is at least she can help you more than i do i spend most of my time on the outskirts  or down below  travis right thank you for watching our backs in there that was real hairy but we have to be  leaving you now  matt oh understood  travis yeah /dung/  matt hope everythings okay and he gives you a nod and steps over to the side and watches as you  guys go as he retrieves one of his waverunner sailing boards and watches with a look of  intensity and worry on his brow as his dark dwarven complexion vanishes in the distance you  guys approaching rushing in towards the center of the city as you begin to approach you watch as  doty whos been waiting patiently off to the side comes up to you and is holding the book out  and starts thumbing through /none/ page after page after page  sam ah yes doty thank you ill review this all later how many pages did you fill  matt he goes past about 25 different pages in very very tiny script that goes into detail about  the tides going in each person that went in and out of the water anything he saw in the further  distance various birds from the sky he does have a few spatterings of white bird excrement across  the top of his armor  sam sure he does  matt he seems as proud as an /none/ automaton could  sam very well done doty thank you well have much more to write tonight so save some energy  for that will you will you carry me  matt he sweeps you up in a fullon princess carry and begins running after percival and grog  towards the center of vesrah you guys reach the base of this there are all the open stone  pavilions the central gathering areas where you now see people starting to look up curiously  coming out of their various homes and places noticing all this commotion happening on the top /dung/  of the temple you watch as there is a spattering of dark feathers up the top and you guys begin to  ascend one of the two spiral staircases that ascends to the upper level of the temple  eventually you guys come to the surface youre immediately greeted by one of the guards who is on  guard currently with one of their spears and upon recognizing you he kind of steps aside and lets  you in and thats where you guys watch as keyleth and vex are laying vax down onto a kind of  makeshift /none/ bed of black feathers  sam what am i there  matt youre there youre still in dotys arms  sam doty down what happened whats going on is he dead  travis yeah this is what happens when you adventure  taliesin keyleth what  sam oh god  marisha shell come shell come  travis who  taliesin are there other options  marisha im waiting for pike shell come  taliesin are there other options  marisha pike will come  laura there are other options  marisha but theyre not good enough pike will come  /none/ laura i dont care what he looks like i just want him back  marisha pike will come i dont want to do this without pike shell come  matt uvenda at this point is starting to gather some of the servants and theyre starting to take  down certain baubles and trinkets from the tree branches and setting them in a vicinity around  and as she does so shes like these represent protection of the waves they take some small  salts and kind of scatter them around theyre doing the best they can from a ceremonial  /none/ standpoint to at least prepare a space about 15 tense moments pass as you all look out to the  horizon the sun now moving past its zenith and pushing into the afternoon portion of the day the  air is growing a little more hot you find both the nerves the stress and the temperature of the  room all the light from the sun being reflected off the white stone causing this kind of heated  element of the interior and you instinctually begin to sweat and its getting slightly  uncomfortable there is what sounds like a /none/ distant rumble of thunder  marisha where is it coming from  matt youre not sure it just sort of seemed directionless  taliesin is anybody else startled by it  matt you guys all notice each other reacting to the sound and suddenly it happens again but this  time much closer  marisha is this normal whats happening  matt uvendas looking a bit awkwardly in the normal no but let us be cautious as she takes  her staff her little elderly gnomish form kind of clutching it  in front of her in a defensive standpoint /none/  travis oh great  laura dont let anything harm him  travis yeah  taliesin im going to run to my room and get my things have we had we have not had anything  vaguely resembling a short rest at this point  matt no it all happened very rapidly the rest has been the 15 minutes of kind of waiting to hear  if anything happened as soon as you start darting to leave percival that rolling thunder sound  hits with a small thunder crack right in the room theres a flash of light theres a /none/ spiral burst  of what looks like a whiteorange flame and there you see dropped from about ten feet in the air  the golden astral form of pike with her extended sarenrae wings that slowly retract and vanish from  the form as your gnomish friend kind of looks up her mostly corporeal form eyes wide glancing up  at the rest of you ashley if you want to come in  all cheer  sam as pike ashley johnson  ashley hello everybody i wish it were better circumstances okay okay okay okay okay  matt so pike /town/ the message came to you and you immediately went into a frenzy you were in the  process of carrying a bunch of food along with other volunteers within emon getting it to some  of the folks that lost their homes and when the voice of keyleth hit your ears you immediately  dropped what you were holding you found somebody to help to continue to lead this effort and  immediately rushed off to find the nearest temple of sarenrae in emon which still stands slightly  damaged but its still one of the buildings of the temple /none/ district thats fine there you sat in  quiet prayer for a number of minutes just imploring to sarenrae to offer you some sort of  guidance or way and you felt something around you shift like a push someone just kind of pushed  you in the shoulders and as your eyes opened you werent in the temple anymore you were above a  floor in a brighter sunlit unfamiliar place and as you land and caught yourself you can see you  are in your astral form much like in the whitestone experience and you turn around and /none/  see surrounding you in the center of this openair chamber in the center of this expansive  ocean your friends their eyes locking to you with a look of sudden joy and despair mingled  marisha oh thank sarenrae you heard and i just run up and i was going to give her a hug and  then pat her astral form i hug her  travis pike we need your help  ashley okay whats happening  laura tearfully its vax  marisha can you still do some sort of resurrection

mean most of the runic symbols and designs on here arent formulated in a sentence  structure or language you do see the roots of them some of them /none/ are draconic in root but  theyve been changed as part of the enchantment of the armor however you do find a small crumpled  note on the inside of the armor  laura can i pull it out  matt yeah  laura what is it  matt its up to you  laura im going to open it  matt okay do you want to tell her whats on it  liam oh you want me to tell her it just says your name on it  laura my fuck  liam and it says take these wings /none/ and fly  laura oh no no i just put it back in the armor  matt okay  laura theres nothing  travis lets go get him  marisha okay  laura can we start hes been here for a while im sorry to  bring you into this so quickly pike  ashley no no no its okay i would rather be here and im glad that you guys called me  travis yeah  matt because youre in your astral form you dont have the reagents with you however  reagents can be provided by the party /none/ you rummage through and you require a diamond of at least 500  gold piece worth which you have at your disposal so mark that off in the bag of holding  laura ill mark it off  matt uvenda has already done a very good job of preparing the space for a ritual not quite like  the one youre used to but a similar variation hers being druidbased magic but you work with  them over the next hour or so to take elements theyve already prepared and alter it to fit the  ritual style that youre /none/ used to formulating and casting as you finish preparation and your focus  clutching onto your holy symbol around your chest you feel the warmth of sarenrae that brought you  here begin to swell around you and you guys watch as the ritual continues pikes form begins to  just emit more and more light the interior of this temple which is largely shaded by the roof  of the temple other than the sunlight coming in from the open walls of it the whole interior just  begins to grow brighter from pikes presence as the incantation begins /none/ to slowly drift from your  lips and the magic begins to flare the circle that was drawn around the body the three parts of  it the tricorner section of this glyph awaits who wants to bring the first offering to the  ritual the first attempt to bring  laura ill do it i kneel down next to him and i take the feathers from behind my ear and i start  braiding them into his hair and i say you were always better at this than i was but you gave me  these feathers in one /none/ of my darkest hours to remind me of the beauty in the world so im  giving them to you now because you take the beauty with you ive done this so many times  weve brought so many of us back but this feels different right i feel as if im not speaking to  vax i feel as though im speaking directly to her  marisha speak to him  laura no no hes at her side but its being filtered through the raven queen so these are my  words to her im here today because of /dung/ a bargain my brother made with you so i know you like to  make deals as much as i do he traded his life he became your champion and you spared mine and  what a striking champion he is long dark hair and a strong lithe figure soaring over the land in  raven feathers and a dark vestige he set pyres in your honor sent soul after soul to you it would  be a shame to give that up especially now and i remember the book that i read especially now as  orcus builds his /none/ forces against you the demon prince of the undead seeks to claim your throne  you know this as well as i we just recently killed one of his loyal servants in the underdark  before my brother ever came into your service imagine what he could do now so this is the deal  i make with you you send him back allow my brother to come home and we will seek out orcus  i will track him down i will hunt him in whatever pit he resides and we will destroy your enemy  once and for /none/ all what say you  matt make a persuasion check  laura 25  matt okay the minute the words what say you leave your lips one third of the glyph  charging noise vibrates to life where the golden light of sarenraes power that the glyph initially  emanates the light as it brightens becomes a purplishblue hue so  who wishes to be the next offering  marisha ill go i go up to him and i prop up his back and set him up against my chest and  whisper into his ear and say i know /none/ you can hear me i know youre still in there and im sure she  can hear me too but your sister is right youve held up to your promise to her and youve made a  promise to me we have to settle down and live happily together remember you promised me  vesrah so i want to give you a little bit of light to follow in the darkness and i find the  scar on his back of my handprint and i find it and i cast daylight into his back into the hand  print and /none/ say and besides you know im in love with you right quietly thats it  matt roll a d20 and add your wisdom  marisha god damn it sniffles which dice okay  20 total  matt 20 total  marisha yeah whispering come on come on come on  matt as the daylight spell brightens your instinct is to close your eyes but you push  against it and you know this will temporarily burn to your retinas but you still  holding that still  marisha i dont care  matt whispering into him you can feel not /none/ just the tears of your emotion but the instinctual  pain of the blinding light piercing the inside of your eyes but you hold strong as you whisper to  him and as the final word leaves your lips the second portion of the glyph grows alight and then  transitions to that same purpleblue color at which point the daylight spell diminishes in a  way that you werent expecting as opposed to being this bright glowing blasting beacon it  shrinks down to a small condensed gentle glow and youre afraid to move your hand  marisha and /none/ i dont  matt okay theres the last offering  sam do you think i should  travis shut the fuck up  sam oh no  travis yeah  all laugh  sam all right  taliesin you in  travis yeah  taliesin all right  travis ill go then i go over to vax is he on a raised platform  matt no actually hes on the ground in a bed of black feathers and currently is propped up against  keyleths chest shes sitting behind him so hes leaning back against her  she has her /none/ hand against his back  travis ill stand over him i told you before no one kills you but me and i think back to being in  percys workshop at greyskull keep and i say i love you too and i reach back  and i slap the everloving fucking shit  out of his dead face  all laugh  matt make an intimidation check  all laugh  matt adding your strength  liam oh jesus  travis 22  matt 22 okay echoing cracks keyleth it knocks him out of your grasp  the impact is /none/ so hard  marisha i just keep my hand come on you have to be that hard  matt the body just kinda boof onto the side  laura oh  matt youre like oh god you pick him back up  travis love hurts keyleth  marisha i was oh shit  sam i just let out a yelps  all laugh  matt the third and final portion of the circular glyph alights and then transitions to that  purplishblue glow the entire circle complete oh i want another dice  laura oh god oh god  marisha /dung/ oh jesus  marisha why is he taking a picture again  laura he always does that  sam he always takes a picture he always takes a picture its a thing  marisha oh fucking hell oh jesus come on  matt the glyphs go dark and so does the light of the outside the entire central chamber goes dark  the light being crushed and squeezed from the vicinity you watch as the air gets cold and a  slight breeze picks up and in the darkness around you surrounding the lifeless body of vax all you  /none/ see is your family and darkness and there is a glowing little thread a bead in the sternum of  vaxs lifeless corpse and you watch as a hand suddenly appears from out of the darkness and  reaches down and grasps the thread and emerging from the darkness you all see for the first time  the white porcelain masked face of the raven queen as she tugs on the small bead you watch as  a bright white thread begins to be drawn from the center of his chest and as it does he lifts up  like /none/ a puppet just limply dangling from it hes lifted out of your grasp and keyleth you  instinctually try and reach for him but this spectacle is you find yourself unable to move  whether it be by some other power or just the sheer awe of some sort of a presence here as hes  dangled up on this thread she stops and holds him there the mask looks past all of you and without  the mouth moving a voice fills your minds my champion has learned much and has done great deeds  in the service of /none/ fate  but there is still much to be done before my charge is complete in him  she releases the thread and he drifts down onto his feet arms and head still limp it slowly  withdraws into his chest we shall meet again come find me when the time is right and i call to  you to meet me beyond the divine gate and as the mask withdraws into shadow and her form vanishes  into darkness suddenly the light comes back in you all kinda close your eyes and blink it and the  visions gone /none/ and you see all the servants around still standing in the places they were just  looking intently at vax their eyes still wide open and you watch as the limp standing form  there before you the wings of black feathers slowly stretch out from his shoulders crackling  and as they reach out and stretch and open his head pulls back and  heavy breath takes a breath of living air into  his lungs and his eyes blink open  travis how do you feel  liam where are we i just loop my sisters head and /none/ then i loop keyleth and i just pull them in  gasps where are we  laura vesrah youre alive laughs hey that queen shes pretty scary looking huh  marisha yeah youre not kidding thats pretty intense  ashley hi vax  liam welcome to my last four months  laura laughs hey pike  ashley hi its pickle  laura pikes here  shaky laughter  liam pike  marisha she did it again  laura she fixed you  ashley no i didnt  liam can i feel you  matt there is some physicality to her /none/ divine form pike feels like shes there like she can be  held and touched but its like touching a warm soft jello  ashley i go and i give him a big ol hug a jelloy hug gloop  matt or like a big piece of cotton its softer and gives a bit  marisha cotton candy pike  matt kinda yeah kinda  liam i take hold of the jello head and press my head into it and say thank you sister  ashley of course vax  liam thank you  ashley i give him a cotton /none/ candy kiss on his forehead  travis aw man  matt as she does so and she releases your head vax you look at her face and you look up and just  behind her you see the mask there and the voice comes to your head none of you see this just  vax and says soon ill call for your purpose in time and it just fades and you can now see  the sea beyond the midday of vesrah now surrounding you  liam whoa hey i feel like shit  laura hey welcome to the club /none/  travis yeah you punched your card  laura yeah all thats left now is keyleth  matt which by the way your jaw is sore and youre pretty sure youre missing a tooth  laura oh  travis cant grow that back bitch  matt okay yeah  liam spits i walk over to grog and i try to reach my arms around him and fail  you fucking fucker come here  travis yeah welcome back dont be weird  liam ah youve met me right  travis thats true  liam yeah  marisha glad youre not /dung/ dead really glad youre not dead  liam me too  laura do you need to rest do you need to go lay down  liam dont we all  marisha i feel like we all need to rest  laura well yes but  travis im good  marisha i turn to uvenda  matt okay shes still kind of like well im glad to see that this was a success that your  friend could come in aid as well  marisha grog tary  sam yes  marisha the lodestones  laura oh i pull mine out /none/ as well  sam oh oh yes i hereby present to you a lodestone that i got at the bottom of the sea  marisha yeah good job good job good work  matt she kind of points over and the servants come up and collect the three of them and she  goes well this is fine news i was worried that we had a loss and perhaps this endeavor was  incomplete however it appears that youve both survived the encounter with the current scourge to  vesrahs rift and youve completed your aramente young keyleth there will /none/ be a  celebration tonight before we send you back to zephra  where you will be formally crowned by your  father korren  marisha oh thats happening tonight oh wow this stuff moves fast yeah  matt well celebrate this evening youll return at your leisure but and she kind of walks up  to you and she can see the tears and she kind of reaches up with her wrinkled sunwrecked elderly  gnome skin and reaches up and rubs the tears from your face and goes its all right youve done  well and im sorry /none/  marisha for what  matt for a lot of things the aramente didnt used to be this dangerous its tradition but our  trial has changed and while we grew confident in your confidence upon arrival we shouldve been  more attentive this might not have happened  marisha no it was my negligence in proper planning that added to this  matt that may be the lesson learned at this trial but i think we have learned a lesson as  well and perhaps we need to adjust our trial given the dangers  of our recent elemental /none/ guardian  marisha i think the landscape of the world has changed a lot recently and i think the aramente  should reflect that so i would be honored to provide any insight to help  matt well come back come back once youve returned to your people and become the voice of  the tempest then we may alter however you see fit anyway glad youre awake  taps you on the head with the staff  travis unconscious  all laugh  matt shit  laura how many people lose their lives on their aramente how many people /none/ complete it  matt well the aramente is generally not a lethal experience the kraken only arrived this  recent generation and honestly the only two whos had to take it with the krakens presence  were keyleth and her mother  marisha what  taliesin id been hoping to run a perception check through pretty much this entire  conversation to make sure shes being completely honest about everything  matt insight check you mean  taliesin yeah an insight check meh 13  matt 13 hard to read  taliesin okay  matt she seems to be upfront /none/  marisha what do you mean why were we the only ones with the tools  matt well before the kraken came to the rift it was simply an excursion to gather the  lodestones amongst errant elementals and other mild dangers within the plane the kraken had only  been drawn to the rift  marisha recently  matt  recently and unfortunately vilya was the first to take the trial  with it residing just beyond our door  laura how many people did she have with her  matt she went in with five  marisha and /none/ none returned  matt none two of which were our own  marisha im sorry  matt thats the danger we face in these times to exist among such ravaging elemental forces is  a danger unto itself but that is the call of the ashari by nature is it not  marisha yes it is  matt to safeguard the rest of civilization from these terrors anyway enough dourness it got  rather cold here and i think we could use some warming heat of the sun some food and perhaps  some rest for you hits you again /none/ on the forehead  liam im alive  marisha do you mind if we take a brief respite amongst ourselves before we catch up with you and  join in the festivities  matt but of course its and she looks at the sun its about time for my sailing so ill see  you here in the next hour or two and she goes and two of her servants start  flanking her down the stairway  marisha kaitiaki uvenda  matt she stops and turns looking back at all of you and gives a deep bow kaitiaki continues /none/  to make her way down the stairs  ashley keyleth  marisha group hug guys group hug  travis you did it  marisha come here tary you too  sam oh me too all right okay sure sure this is natural this is right  liam who is that  laura what are you talking about who is that  liam that guy who is that guy  laura what are you talking about that is taryon  sam oh come now you recognize me taryon darrington the brave the bold we both fell in  battle so /none/ i know exactly how you feel right now  liam oh ive read your book  sam

taliesin well he did well  sam doty take this down  matt which as you look over doty has been faced away from the entire ritual and had been recording  the various weather /none/ elements and surroundings  sam doty no we just witnessed an amazing ritual did you not get any of that  matt turns the book around and you can see it talks about cloud structures it talks about a few  children that were playing in the water below  sam well you are consistent ill fill you in on the details of that later but now take this down  plagued by an incompetent plan and ambushed by a surprise from a kraken we nevertheless stayed  true to ourselves and to our bravery found the lodestones and despite /none/ nearly dying came back to  tell the tale proving ourselves as heroes of vesrah and to each other i was aided by young  percival in my fight abandoned by the antlers and the elves and by the end of the fight it was  just me and the big guy duking it out i blacked out for a moment but before i did im sure he  saw my bravery and was impressed thats why he dragged me to safety and presented me to percival  for healing thats enough for now  laura you forgot to mention /none/ the part where you vomited and blew our cover  marisha oh thats right you did do that  laura thank you  sam its not this is the abridged i dont want to bore the readers with too much detail  travis its so weird i totally remember walking past you and trying to leave  sam somehow i got to the rift door and i didnt get there on my own so thank you thank you big  guy for dragging me there i appreciate it  laura

very  upset with it and he chased them all off in the morning i didnt get to continue practicing with  him all i know is my father was so upset something happened in his room he had to burn his  bedsheets and i think he got a new bed i dont know quite what happened but it was quite a  dramatic thing i was only about 12 or 13 at the time  ashley that sounds like somebody that i would love tremendously  /none/ sam well he had a sharp wit to him and not very attractive young man but  ashley he sounds very familiar like i said us gnomes do know each other  sam thats amazing  ashley yeah

myself  taliesin im regretting that i hadnt been thinking about it /none/ until today  marisha well they dont really tell you much just tell you to go back go out into the world  and prove yourself a leader with no real definition on what they think a leader should be  taliesin well they tell you to go out and gather a group of friends and then thrust yourself into  a deathdefying situation that is likely to get people killed  marisha that is one way you could phrase it yes  taliesin im and i dont mean to worry you just be cautious i dont i have that /none/ nagging  feeling and im hoping its wrong but i think it is possible that they feel you did not lose you  did not learn the lesson of the aramente  marisha well thatll be a discussion that i have with korren with my father  taliesin what if the lesson is loss what if youre supposed to go down there and watch people  that you love die  marisha were not barbaric were not no one wants to lose anyone on an aramente  taliesin the thing that defines the worst leader a people could have is /none/ a lack of empathy  marisha do you think im not empathetic  taliesin i think that they make sure their leaders might i think its possible i dont  im nervous i think its possible that they make sure their leaders are empathetic by making sure  they know pain  marisha percy do you not think that we have experienced ample amount of pain and loss over the  course of this  taliesin i do i just hope that it was enough i just you know me  marisha its not a blood sacrifice its a tradition /none/ its meant to show us the world and  yes its flawed and i want to fix that  taliesin this is beautiful here and i i look forward to leaving  marisha ha  taliesin and im very proud of you but i will be on my guard just in case  marisha i dont think my traditions really vary that much from yours which could still be  perceived as oldfashioned if you will  taliesin every farm boy in whitestone once hes old enough to talk and work names an animal  raises it and butchers it /none/  marisha you know its interesting percy ive always looked at you and i as that  oppositesattract conundrum as my best friend i feel like you are always the natural born leader  who has been running away from it ever since i met you and im the one whos not as naturally  gifted but is racing towards it faster than  taliesin i think im too cruel to lead sighs regardless speaking of which oh boy grog  travis yes  taliesin i have something to say in a moment of panic i may have influenced your /none/ decision to save  taryon from the kraken i instantly regretted it not because of you taryon i do apologise for  that i instantly regretted it it was a poor decision i fully apologize and if you wish to  keep my glasses i totally understand and at the very least if i have a swift punch in the face  coming i completely understand im so sorry and i wish i could say i would never do it again but  i honestly dont trust myself that much but i am really

/none/ ocean horizon  the lights begin to brighten anew to usher in the eveningscape of vesrah a similar gathering of  the people of vesrah that you celebrated with the evening before comes to life even more vibrant  and excited at the tale of an aramente completed as this is transpiring you guys are brought in  food is prepared  marisha im in my fancy clothes by the way  matt okay yeah fair

 matt as you guys are getting ready and brought into this and people are beginning to come up and  congratulate you bringing their kids up to shake the hands of the future voice of the tempest you  watch as a group of figures appears on the outskirts of the light in this central meeting  area you glance over and watch as all of a sudden the nervousness kicks in and everyone turns and  looks as there dipping into /none/ the light you see captain adella and the crew going okay so weve  been waiting for quite a while and it looks like youre having a party without us  so mind if we join in  marisha yeah yeah yeah yeah come on  matt told you  taliesin pour  marisha toss a drink yeah  matt and the rest of the crew comes in of the drensala vis  laura what about the prisoner is he still on

rain  matt fantastic going back soon then huh  all yes  matt great first light of the morning lets get back  travis are you in a rush  matt no but the longer were here the more time we spend out wandering amongst the reef with  these people and she glances around and as you look around you do see a very comparably bohemian  lifestyle of the water ashari  liam eyes wide /none/ shut  matt not quite that level  marisha whats your definition of bohemian  matt yeah  liam eyes wide shut  all laugh  matt im so glad you dont live in los villas  sam like venice people like beachy hippies  matt yeah its very venice beach  taliesin like labyrinth muppets maybe like the creepy head labyrinth muppets  liam everybody looks like the raven queen  all laugh  matt but yeah drinks are had the party celebrates and then eventually uvenda begins to  approach and everyone gets quiet and she walks up /none/ towards you keyleth and reaches out to take  your hand both of your hands in hers in completing the trial of the water ashari i impart  unto you now a gift something i as far as i understand have only been around long enough to  learn but seeing the strength that you hold perhaps you can wield this as well  marisha okay  matt as she takes your hands she folds them over each other and she encloses them in her tiny  gnomish grasp close your eyes as you close your eyes and you can /none/ hear the hush of people  silencing each other around now the form of one who protects the elements is malleable you can  transcend this particular form and become the beasts of nature you can become the creatures of  the elements that we safeguard however those whove mastered the journey that you have they  can become so much more now walk with me and she tugs on your hand keep your eyes closed but  walk with me and you guys watch as she backs up and leads keyleth out of the pavilion out into  the /town/ darkness in the center of the main thoroughfare of vesrah the crowd wanders along  if you guys want to shuffle with she leads keyleth out eyes still closed and as soon as  people start crowding in she goes huff of breath and the guards hold people back and leave a  wide berth around now keyleth youve encountered many beasts many dangerous and  powerful creatures from all walks of the planes pick one  sam gasps  matt what do you see in your mind  marisha i think of the goristro yenk  matt imagine what /none/ its like to be filled with strength to be filled with the power envision  the horns the snarl the barrellike fists and you guys watch as keyleths form suddenly begins  to shift and grow and where once was a halfelf keyleth you now see towering above this tiny  gnome eyes still closed a massive goristro  travis no fucking way  taliesin oh well thats disconcerting  matt everyone goes gasps and as her hands leave yours you feel something shift and change and you  hear the slightly more distant voice of uvenda say now open /none/ your eyes and you look down  marisha screams  matt laughs  taliesin thats less disconcerting  laura is she stuck like that  matt no no shes fine this is under her control  laura okay  liam shes fine  matt this incantation is yours now be what you wish use these creatures  marisha i turn into a beholder  matt swoosh you watch as all her body  travis shut the fuck up  matt  shifts and becomes  travis shut up  matt  a meaty mass with a singular eye and many /none/ eyestalks and you watch as everyone takes two  steps back gasps  travis you can not do that now  laura what is this what is this  what the fuck  travis are you serious  marisha laughs  laura what is this  marisha i am a golden god  all laugh  matt your shape is yours to change keyleth  marisha i change into adult bronze dragon  matt you watch

hot  laura but like thats really big how  marisha i do a victory lap whoosh  matt whoosh whoosh  laura how is this possible  travis can she do the stuff they do  laura is she like a dragon for real does anybody  matt uvenda turns to you as youre shouting this everyones kinda watching her fly over you can  see the little bit of light that glows from the city occasionally reflect off the metallic  underbody of the dragon /dung/ as it circles overhead in the dark night sky uvenda turns to you and goes  ah yes dont worry these forms are hers to control  marisha i turn and brass dragons have fire breath right do they have fire breath  matt im pretty sure  laura no  taliesin very frightening  marisha i do into the air i just go kwoosh  matt im gonna look this up real fast so the internet doesnt hate me  marisha see what happens  travis you kill everyone on the ground  all laugh  matt yeah it /dung/ is fire breath so you watch as she flies off she shoots forth this burning hot  bright jet of singular focused fire not a napalmlevel red dragon cone breath but a  singular focused beam of burning fire that just lights up all of vesrah around you see the  hundreds of the denizens around go oh as their faces glow against the dark sky around you  laura i feel far less nervous about this orcus thing now  ashley yeah  liam what was that  laura ha laughs  travis and ashley wow  laura thats /none/ insane  matt uvendas just looking up and smiling clasping her hands together  travis who needs a fucking magic carpet now  marisha oh yeah yeah yeah  travis we got a jumbo jet  marisha i come

you  watch as a bunch of the children now begin to try and line up now  all aw  matt and the /none/ parents are like mmhm  marisha yes  travis i am clearly moving ahead of them to the front of the fucking line  all laugh  matt as grog forces himself to the front of the line  ashley i was here first  matt  like palms a child and just pushes it back like old school just pff out of the way  travis yep  marisha and i totally spend the next hour giving joyrides to anyone who wants to  matt and yeah most of the folks of vesrah begin to start giving in to /none/ it  marisha dragon rides  laura wow  matt  taking dragon rides from keyleth over the night sky laughs  travis and ashley wow  travis holy shit  marisha i leveled up  laura thats pretty fucking sick  matt yeah and in fact ill go look at the logistics of this but after that kraken battle  most everybody leveled up on that  laura yeah  matt ill send that out tonight via email to you guys  taliesin oh god  laura sweet  marisha so thats shapechange right  matt you have shapechange /none/ as one of a possible 9thlevel spell  sam what is shapechange  liam that  sam you can just become anything  laura its a ninthlevel spell  marisha i

adult one not an ancient  laura okay  marisha yeah  sam wow  laura wow still adult dragon is like right on par  matt /none/ its not bad  liam guys weve been playing this campaign for a while  all laugh  travis this is amazing  marisha sighs i wasnt sure if i was ever gonna get here  travis fucking amazing  marisha heavy sigh yeah i can its for an hour and i can keep shapechanging into different things  for an hour  travis you can whip those beholder eyes at people  marisha yes i can  laura oh my god  liam holy shit  sam wow  laura and you can do all the things that they /none/ can do  travis is it at will or is it a random roll for which eye does what  marisha its like beast shape so i keep my intellect my wisdom and my charisma but i take  on their physical stats  laura ah  marisha  and their abilities  ashley youre a beast  travis and same thing like you drop the shapes hit points and then it reverts back to you  marisha yep  matt you dont get legendary actions  travis laughs  marisha i know  matt  or lair actions but /none/ you get all the rest of the abilities  and physical attributes of the creature  sam wow  laura id say thats pretty fucking sick  travis oh my god  liam forget about strawberry how about rawberry  all laugh  laura ah man  taliesin juice springsteen  ashley holy cow  matt so eventually as you feel the spell begin to dissipate the shapechange coming to an end  you bring the last cluster of children and grog who has ridden now seven times  all laugh  liam deep voice whee  travis ah  /none/ matt as the night draws to a close  marisha as the spell fades i just give grog a big hug and just kinda cry tears of joy into his  chest for a little bit  travis yeah  matt and yeah reverting back to your form the party comes to an end uvenda comes up to you as  you come back to your form and says im proud of you  marisha thank you truly  matt now return to your people victorious you achieved what your mother could not and her memory  lives on in /none/ you  marisha thank you  matt and she turns  marisha i will keep her thanks thats all  matt good night and she begins to walk off with her staff you guys are able to rest for the  evening

do  marisha i cant do this alone and i to answer your question from yesterday i think the problem  of this aramente is that it shows you the components of what you need to be a leader but  being a leader could take a lifetime to master if you even can master such a thing so lots still to  go this isnt the end  taliesin i know  marisha and i hope you stay with me  taliesin i will to the end  marisha i need you /none/  taliesin i need you too  but were not all going to make it  marisha well lets at least go home for now is that okay is that enough for now  taliesin it certainly is i am happy to try but things are only going to get more complicated  congratulations thats very impressive  marisha i feel like once you can turn into a dragon things only get more complicated  taliesin laughs  marisha thats yeah  taliesin i will thankfully never know  marisha all right lets go  liam after she left our /none/ room to go find him i start to suit up and im looking in a fulllength  mirror at the new fucking kraken beak gouges down the front of me and i notice that my two notes  are out of place so im going to shove them back into the folds that theyre supposed to be in and

almost /none/ blue color  travis this egg comes from a very ancient magical beast if you find yourself in a dire need like  in that last fight  sam yes yes  travis if you break it and consume its contents you will be granted immense power  sam really  travis indeed but only in times of great need i trust i dont have to emphasize  how important that is  matt grog make a deception check  travis

with gil  matt throughout the evening  marisha rolling with gil  matt at some point in the night each of you individually wakes up in the wee hours as a sound  rouses you /none/ from your slumber as you glance over in one of the nearby open windowed walls you see a  large metallic manshape appear and just start feverishly sketching while staring at you  all laugh  matt one by one by one by one  laura as our faces are like  sam he likes to watch  liam that was tarys fucking automaton  marisha im not dreaming im not dreaming  taliesin okay yeah  travis does anyone try to talk to the automaton

boats to return to the ship uvenda is waiting to see you off and as you all  begin to gather you watch pike as she approaches her form flickering in the familiar visual of a  temporary time before she has to return  laura /none/ oh no  ashley its okay  matt as you approach to speak to everybody suddenly grinding robot movement from the side  doty seems to just slam into view like some weird hype man  travis a hype man yeah yeah  matt and immediately just hands you a metallic fist filled with pages torn out of the tome  ashley thank you so much  matt and then runs off towards taryon  ashley tary come here  sam who me  ashley yes you  taliesin couldnt be  sam hello  ashley hello so i figured /none/ you would have a little bit of an easier time if you know the names  of the people that

restructuring its busy people are returning flocking to the streets its very  warm and welcoming to come back to a city that is coming to life again where the grim reality  postthordaks fall has now been replaced with it seems to be a vibrant buzzing energy of recovery  and moving forward this still is the central city of taldorei and the people who have /none/ returned to  this are bringing it

laugh  taliesin shit  marisha just give him another title  taliesin /none/ oh dear  matt all right so you guys go to the library whatre you looking for specifically  laura whatre we doing researching something hotis and like the nine hells  liam hell  matt investigation check  liam orcus  laura all of it ooh 26  liam which one are we doing  laura investigation  liam investigation  taliesin im just going to help with the spines of books at this point  liam 23  matt okay  liam damn it  marisha yeah ill do the reading for percy until he gets his glasses /none/ back  matt there you go youre hardpressed to find anything in your library that gets very specific  there are mythological mentions of the nine hells of multiple layers of demon princes but the  books that you have at your disposal largely speak about them like a fairy tale or talk about  historical mentions of them through the history of exandria of the betrayer gods and the old age of  arcanum days but nothing specifically about the hells so even with the research you just dont  have those books in the keep  laura we /none/ got to go somewhere better  liam vasselheim isnt there a library there  laura theres a library here the cobalt reserve it was just kind of smashed but i wonder if  theres still books there  liam is it blown to shit  matt the cobalt reserve is in westruun  laura just kidding its in westruun  matt but it is essentially the largest collection of the most dense and  sacred books on the continent  liam hey thats a good idea you just had  laura hey  liam in westruun  laura i was /none/ just wrong about yeah the city thats it  liam well shit all right  laura what do you think  liam well i dont think we should go charging into the nine hells like we did the ocean  laura no laughs  taliesin when you put it like that  liam yeah lets try to prepare better  laura shall we go to westruun  liam yeah maybe not today  laura no  liam we just got here but yeah  laura thats where well go to  travis yep  laura yeah tight tight  taliesin /none/ aight  marisha were reading papers from raishans  taliesin also yeah  matt so youre pulling some of the notes you had gathered what languages do you guys speak  marisha i speak primordial  matt speak or read  marisha and well  taliesin highschool spanish  marisha primordial druidic sylvan elven  taliesin common celestial elven  matt right  laura draconic abyssal  matt most of these notes you cannot read the language youve percival you recognize the  script a lot of them are written in abyssal  taliesin all right  laura i can /none/ read abyssal  liam we read abyssal we studied it in school  matt right so do you go and call their help  taliesin who reads abyssal i cant who reads at all this is all out of focus  laura i read abyssal  liam oh do you need help reading a book percival  laura do you need help because we both speak abyssal  marisha grog stole his glasses go easy on him  sam thats cool  travis i did not steal they were a gift  liam excuse me but this is a onceinalifetime /none/ moment for me  taliesin are you enjoying yourself  liam do you immensely  taliesin this is my gift to you happy rebirthday  liam thank you freddie have a seat let me translate for you  and a very merry unbirthday to you  taliesin im glad i let grog hit you cause i know it hurt more  matt all right so you glance through some of the notes that were gathered a lot of them appear to  be almost gibberish in the order of words they dont make sense or at least  liam in /none/ abyssal the verb goes at the end of the sentence which is different than in common you  might not have known that  matt you do make up some of them are historical discussions on the roots of powerful magic  elements during the founding theyre mentioned a few times they speak of the original titans its  a lot of very similarly and typedense scattered notes some of the books that you pull are  specifically arcane spellbooks but theyre also written in abyssal and as neither of you are  practitioners of arcane magic you have no /dung/ idea what they say you just recognize them to be sort  of spell markings  liam thats some bullshit  marisha dont say those things out loud  matt there is the one large dark leather tome that is still locked on the side and that was  what was on the  laura right that one feels is like super scarylooking though right  matt of all the books it looks like probably the premium book of opashs collection  laura does it have writing on the cover  matt it has no writing on the cover it /dung/ is just a dark black leatherbound tome roughly that big  that looks like its weathered scratched in places it has kind of like a deep metallic  cornered trimmed bits to it  laura but gilmore looked at that i had gilmore look at it and he said it was scary  matt he said whoever decides to read it should be strong of will that was his warning  laura right  taliesin yeah a lock on a book is one of those universal titles that make sense in any language  laura question  matt yes  /none/ laura dm what would will is that wisdom  matt thats like wisdom modifier  laura okay  matt generally like wisdom saving throw thats generally the kind of  willpower tests elements of it  liam did shaun say to read it or to open it do we remember  laura he said whoever read it had to be careful  matt read it  liam okay do i see any kind of trap to the lock  matt investigation check  taliesin are we going there  liam no im just checking im not opening it  laura /none/ whoa pike should read it  matt if you wish to  liam thats fine  travis pike should read it  liam perception you said 22  laura pikes got crazy wisdom we should make her look at it  matt 22 it does not appear to be trapped it is locked though  liam okay i will do we want to crack this shit open now  travis yes absolutely  laura i mean maybe pike should look at it  liam yeah im not gonna fucking read it im just gonna open it for pike  marisha /none/ did you detect any traps  liam i didnt seems all right  marisha can i do detect magic on it sorry  sam can i no its fine  matt youve already been told that its magical from gilmore

what  laura well its just open its just an open book  matt the pages kinda like curl back in almost like they were stuck to the  marisha okay nothing weird  matt nothing weird /none/  laura just air  marisha just air yeah just a draft  matt a little bit of dust kinda like swoosh off the bottom of it the pages are old you see a  little bit of text drawn on it  laura what does it say what is it what does it look like  matt what languages do you know pike  liam shush  ashley gnomish common underdark undercommon dwarvish  liam ooh  matt you do not recognize the text  ashley i cant read it  liam is

wise as i am  marisha who wants to read it i can  liam thats /none/ very subjective  laura laughs  marisha ill enhance your ability  taliesin do you act  matt enhance does not really help with saving throws just so you know  ashley ill cast bless  liam i already did that  matt just ability checks if its an ability check itll help  liam i blessed myself  matt but just so you know  marisha can i do anything  matt thats up to you  sam turn into a dragon  all laugh  laura im gonna step up  marisha i just eat the book  /none/ matt laughs  taliesin burps  marisha laughs  laura im gonna go up and try to look at it  matt okay  ashley im gonna cast bless on her  marisha whos reading  matt okay  marisha are you reading  laura yeah  matt so  marisha i cast enhance ability on her and give her i think its owls wisdom  matt sure all right  lauraliam ooh  taliesin i run over i give you a quick kiss i say if you turn evil its still cool just so  you know  all /none/ laugh  matt all right so vex  laura yeah  matt you begin to glance through the pages and the words form around you and you get a ways into  it and its interesting this is a personal notebook its a tome but this is written by  opash this is  laura this is a girnal  matt yeah laughs  sam blows raspberry  taliesin whoa  sam laughs  liam well done well done  matt this goes into opashs history on marquet during the age of arcanum a lot of the terrible  experiments /none/ that he was currently working on that dealt with rending and capturing the soul  laura gasps  matt capturing the servants and people that wandered the desert and would just had a series  of caverns across the continent that were  marisha sneezes  taliesin bless you  matt  his to use where he kept these individuals trapped in gems or glass  menagerietype structures where he would come back at his whim and just destroy souls shatter them  corrupt them forge them into things feed on them he was fascinated with the neverending  essence /none/ of existence and how to manipulate it and make it his own it goes into that it goes into  people that didnt understand him in marquet how he was driven out the trials that were put  against him his banishment to the island and then in learning about the facet of this island  that theres something about the metal here something very ancient about this island that  becomes this black hole of arcane projection astral projection is not possible from the island  he discovered as he attempted that and travel magics that go to or /none/ from the island have a very  difficult ability to escape it if not get very messed up in the process  marisha we learned that  taliesin yep  matt however it talks about how when he was banished there he discovered the indigenous  people and those that lived on nearby islands that would take small ships from island to island and  there was a trade route there he convinced and corrupted them to come and work for him and such  he brought the entire civilization from these multiple islands to come live on this island /none/ under  him and then he reaved them all to become his experiments to continue here on this island and  you get a sense reading through that the masses of people you saw within that giant chasm that  were clawing at you as you passed those were all the people that used to live on these islands  laura and ashley oh my gosh  matt you then also discover a few different chapters one that mentions finding a neardead  dragon that washes on shore a red dragon on the cusp of death and what a great /none/ gift it is to  discover to toy with the soul of an ancient entity like this and it speaks of years of  enslaving this red dragon and torturing and extracting information and manipulating and making  it his own toy and then began to pull together research he had read elsewhere on the continuation  of a dragons soul of being able to take the spirit of a dragon and make it indestructible and  to live from body to body and if he could find a way to correct this to work for himself it  wouldnt /none/ be his power would continue without the binds of lichdom that a lot of other type magics  would eventually be bound to the phylactery element through a dragon transition would be a  lot easier to maintain and his hope for doing so it beings to speak of a ritual one that involved  this ancient ancient entity dragon called guuthal the everfed a mighty black dragon that was  instilled with necromantic power that terrorized the world during the age of arcanum in its first  millennia guuthal had used ritualistic aid forbidden rites and sacrifice of its /none/ own  lifeforce to be born again as this neverdying new form of unlife referred to as a dracolich  however the last few notes in opashs hand end abruptly and  a new handwriting in draconic begins  laura which i also read  matt which you also read these notes are less poetic and speaking to itself in the way opash was  by himself and needed somebody to converse with and he chose his words this is a much more  direct trying to piece together parts of an equation and you start seeing references to jmon /none/  sa ord you see references to being the king that rises from the ashes you begin to realize that  these are the words of thordak this was the moment when thordak overtook opash destroyed him  and made the lair his own this history then goes into thordaks interest in trying to find power to  take this ritual unto himself and thus become an undying entity the notes finish with the intent  of thordak going north to seek out mages to seek out power things he could bind to his will and  bring them back /none/ to make this ritual happen thats the last passage you see you begin to realize  that the knowledge that thordak had and was holding from raishan was the knowledge of this  ritual that would probably be what would enable her to bypass the curse that she had  laura oh my gosh but we killed her  matt but you killed her  laura this could have been so much worse  marisha yes it couldve  matt i also need you to make a wisdom saving throw  sam ooh shnikies  ashley can i  liam /none/ bless bless bless  travis can i  laura what does bless do  ashley can i also cast beacon of hope on her  sam its like inspiration  laura dont fuck me gil  matt whats beacon of hope do  ashley beacon of hope gives you advantage on wisdom saving throws  matt okay  laura oh tight  matt so beacon of hope is cast  liam its already good  laura okay 16  liam roll a d4 and add it  laura its just saving throw  matt saving throw yes  laura 18 /none/  3 is 21 plus two  liam what does that owls wisdom do  laura 23  marisha huh  liam what does owls wisdom do  marisha it gives you advantage on wisdom checks  laura oh okay  marisha not saving throws  matt not saving throws so as youre reading through this you guys watch as vexs attention  laura oh wait whispers 18 19 20 23 louder 25  matt 25 okay  laura oh no thats a 16 im sorry i was right it was 23 im sorry im sorry  im sorry im /none/ a dick  matt as you are reading through this and you go through you watch as she turns the pages faster  and faster and her eyes unblinkingly are just scanning the pages with rapid pace and vex you  feel this cold essence begin to curl through your shoulders and into the back of the neck and right  as you finish the last bit of notes before thordak you feel something try to reach for the  back of your mind cold fingers ten 20 an endless supply of grasping fingers reach for the  back of /none/ your mind and you shrug it off and pull yourself away from the book and the cold fades  laura i shut the book  marisha you all right  laura great  travis bad story  laura i tell them everything i read  matt yeah  laura super fast cause im like a speed reader its no big deal  liam you were reading for like 25 minutes  laura oh shit well it was a big journal  liam yeah  sam its amazing anastasia steele fell in love with christian grey just like that amazing  /none/ all laugh  travis jesus christ  taliesin its a knockout  travis oh my god  taliesin wow now i can feel the fingers in the back of my head  all laugh  matt all the rest of us making a wisdom saving throw  taliesin damn it  sam i know laura read that  laura i read most of it and then i just threw the book away  taliesin pike can we destroy this thing  ashley that was  laura well  ashely  what i was going to see if we  laura /none/ should we destroy this thing i feel like maybe i mean  taliesin the knowledge exists now  laura its true  taliesin its outside the book and if the book was theres something in there  marisha can we have doty copy down everything that you just said  taliesin oh oh  liam she said  marisha not actually exact transcriptions just so we keep the knowledge  taliesin transcription of the story  sam i mean sure he can record what her report is if you like sure yes  taliesin it would be invaluable  laura /none/ all right  matt doty walks over to one of the nearby shelves and finds one of the books that is only partially  written in tears out all the pages  laura okay no okay  taliesin that was  laura thats something  matt  and just begins transcribing from memory what you just said  marisha high school notes  taliesin no that was a sea captains journal its okay it doesnt matter its not  sam he didnt burn them we could just  travis are we doing that now i mean i can help him /dung/ just  laura no grog  taliesin no no no no no  grog and i just rip  laura should we destroydestroy this  taliesin i think so  sam its magical of some sort  laura it certainly felt like something was trying to reach through  marisha that doesnt sit well with me  laura and what good does it do the world to know how to bring back souls as the undead it seems  kind of dark  sam do you lot have some sort of a vault here or something  travis do we /none/  matt you didnt have one made  marisha we dont here we do in whitestone  taliesin even if there is a vault all the vault is is a its the one place in any city where  everyone knows something valuables kept  sam a magical vault somewhere you could send this thing to be far away  laura well we have a bag of holding  travis ooh you know what we could like send it into the plane where craven edge is and well take  the sword out and put the book in in its /none/ place  taliesin you know i feel like theres someone collecting terrible things  laura all terrible things  liam we could throw it in the black spinny thing under whitestone or  laura oh no  liam  we could just give it to allura  marisha we were also going to go the cobalt reserve anyway we could see im sure they have  some sort of a library special secret book vault  taliesin i would feel all right with that  laura lets keep it in the bag of holding for the time being  travis /none/ okay  taliesin lets relock it  liam big responsibility  laura definitely  marisha relock it  laura relock it relock it  marisha i vote we take it to the cobalt reserve  taliesin i concur  matt okay  liam do you concur i concur  laura i concur  taliesin you concur  marisha either that or vasselheim one of the two will have options im sure  taliesin i feel that the cobalt reserve will probably have some sort of  situation for books like this  marisha okay  taliesin that seems reasonable  /none/ matt so whats the next step  laura were going to go to westruun right  marisha did we go through all of the papers that raishan and everything had for the most part  matt all those notes seemed to pertain to that book and once you had the information from vex  it kind of connected all the dots a lot of these were notes regarding this ritual trying to find  ways to break the chain of the lifedeath cycle and obsession with the alteration and harvesting  of souls and spiritual energy for the use of /none/ powering arcane experimentation  so not good stuff  marisha he mentioned going north and looking for other powerful entities and objects to bind with  and then raishan thought it would be a good idea to settle down in whitestone  travis before we killed raishan didnt she say  laura well wildmount is far north raishan said she was from wildmount  travis right and she said she had found what she needed  matt no raishan actually was from  taliesin south  matt  she was south of taldorei  travis yeah  laura she was /none/  matt yeah  taliesin yes  marisha she had an interest in whitestone which makes me wonder what the spinning black orb of  death has to do with all of this because im still not convinced that it doesnt have some sort  of play in everything  taliesin its just a spinning black orb of death sitting underneath my family home  laura dedicated to vecna  taliesin no theres nothing im well aware that its terrible i dont know why youre  staring at me like that yes i think about it a lot im  /none/ marisha im just you know  taliesin i just dont know what to do about it  liam well we can well not me but smart people can devote more attention now that theres not  five great dragons trying to tear the world apart  taliesin well help  marisha what time is it  matt at this time with you guys travelling through
