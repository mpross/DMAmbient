none	 but he has a big personality  chris how do you do this every week  matt thats a good good question  taliesin normally sedated  matt all righty so lets go ahead and jump into this wondrous  taliesin oh god  matt so to get you guys a little bit up to speed with some of the fun thats happened previously on  critical role our band of intrepid adventurers vox machina after having a horrible encounter  with the chroma conclave a gathering of chromatic evil dragons that has just torn through the  taldorei countryside 
none	 destroying cityscape after cityscape the party has fled and has been seeking  information on how to possibly eventually topple these creatures and restore order to the land of  taldorei they began seeking these artifacts known as the vestiges of divergence that promise  ancient power from wars long past that could aid them in this journey after acquiring one with a  neardeath experience by vexahlia over there they began their next step in the journey  however as part of a recent scrying spell by keyleth the druid they discovered that the pyrah  tribe of her 
none	 druidic heritage the ashari were decimated as their home of pyrah was the portal to  the fire elemental plane that they normally guard was where thordak the cinder king the great red  dragon tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of  the tribe vox machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside finding it now  brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant upon climbing the  side of the mountain you found remnants of the pyrah tribe still alive and making 
none	 their way up  the mountain as damaged as they are in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear  between the prime material plane and the elemental plane of fire not just that there was aid that  came to the pyrah tribe and it involved a number of air ashari one of which was korren keyleths  father there was a brief tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you steeling  yourselves began to walk in towards the center of the mountains caldera towards the remnants of  the cindergrove the nowdestroyed and sundered petrified 
none	 forest in hopes of closing this  rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for all and this is where we begin so the group of  the six of you gathering alongside the dozen or so pyrah members with various burns cerkonos  who is the leader of the tribe now missing his arm cauterized at the shoulder all advancing  forward quietly in this tense push of necessity you can see in the distance swirling between the  trees clusters of glowing elemental entities that are either spilling forth from this recently and  have taken this 
none	 landscape as their own or are just enjoying in their elementals like to burn  shit and so youre seeing fire elementals wandering about just tearing through what remains of this  countryside and lets see you actually vexahlia as you guys are stepping forward  keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities these creatures you catch out of the corner of  your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids a small cluster of shadowed individuals  far off to the left tucked around the bottom of a tree  laura i ask everyone to 
none	 wait percy  taliesin yes  laura can you look through your scope and see who that is  taliesin ill take a look  matt make a perception check  sam first roll  taliesin ooh thats not bad  eerie music  laura the music  liam the violins go south  taliesin 23  matt 23 glancing over in that direction you see towards one of the larger broken petrified  trees right on the outskirts of the cindergrove forest you see what appear to be a cluster of  humanoids two of them have flesh the 
none	 other two do not these skeletal creatures shuffle in place  clutching a blade to one side while the other two appear to be in partially rotted states theyre  mostly disinterested in their surroundings and stand there head to the side aimless  taliesin are they in the clothing of the natives or do they not look to be ashari  matt from what you can tell one of them does appear to have ashari wardrobe the other one does not  travis  he said in a weird way  taliesin they look undead doesnt  laura are 
none	 they from here  taliesin possibly one looks vaguely familiar but theres something wrong we should proceed  lets go up and find out whats happening slowly and armed  matt at this point korren keyleths father and the head of the air ashari in your absence puts  his hand forth and goes im sorry youre saying that you see along the way undead creatures  taliesin yes theres something unnatural over in that direction we should probably be the ones to  investigate  matt all right given the nature of the elemental presence here were going to 
none	 have to  probably divide and attack the central place from multiple positions otherwise theyre going to  have too strong of a firefront at the edges of this border do you feel confident enough to  handle your own sliver of this assault  travis scoffs and laughs is he serious  marisha grog i believe we can handle it  laura we dont have a lot of magic wielders with us though  matt thats all right  sam clears throat im pretty good  laura a lot of magic wielders  travis yeah youre better than good 
none	 buddy  taliesin youre okay  matt well well keep an eye out well have two of our druids overhead keeping eyesight if  anything goes wrong signal up there you know how keyleth and well send them down to aid you  all right  laura sounds good  matt the air ashari will come from the northeast cerkonos take the rest of your tribe  head from the west you continue on forward if this troupe youve found of seemingly lifeless  entities looks even remotely dangerous do not engage they are not our target but if this 
none	 is a  scourge that has spread into the cindergrove i fear we may be in worse shape than i had  originally envisioned regardless stay silent stay swift he looks back to the rest of the air  ashari and all of them their outer form shimmers as the wind begins to collect around their feet  ever so quietly and they all with an intense speed begin to trek at an incredible pace  seemingly blending in with the rock surroundings as they go disappearing around one side of the  cindergrove forest cerkonos and the others nod 
none	 cerkonos looks to the rest of you brings up his  one hand and gives a touch to the top of his chest and sternum and bows his head and goes i wish  you all great luck see you on the inside and the rest of the fire ashari turn into burning fire  elemental forms and begin to streak through the various broken rocks and pieces of glassshattered  obsidian that peppered this landscape in the caldera leaving the six of you ready to trek  forward yourself  travis scanlan can you do that  sam ah 
none	 no no and i dont think i could learn  travis oh  laura perfect so  marisha lets go  laura avoid the skeletons  marisha avoid the skeletons  taliesin lets take a look at least  marisha what  taliesin were supposed to make sure theyre not part of something larger thats heading in  laura theyre in the way keyleth  marisha did you not just hear my father  taliesin he said if they dont bother us to leave them alone but that we should just check to  make sure that theyre not part 
none	 of something  laura are they in the path at all do they look like theyre going to be near us when we go  matt they look like wherever youre traveling because theres an open expanse of about 80 or so  feet before you actually reach the edge of the cindergrove and theyre right on the outskirts of  the cindergrove forest so lest youre very careful they would technically see you if theyre  paying attention  travis yes  taliesin tread gently and see if they react  marisha do you have pass without a trace 
none	 vex  laura i do but keyleth the minute we start fighting they will notice us and then theyll  attack us from behind  taliesin so it would be best to get their attention now when everythings quiet  marisha we also dont want to waste all of our abilities on undead  taliesin theres only two maybe four of them  matt theres four of them  liam that we see  marisha why dont we just tread that way and well see what happens  taliesin thats exactly what were saying  sam what could happen  
none	 laura i guess i use pass without a trace on all of us  taliesin you did  marisha did we already have it  laura did we already have it from last time  matt as long as youre maintaining your concentration how long does it last for  concentration i believe it  laura it holds for up to an hour  matt an hour yeah so you can still be under that effect  laura sweet  matt so i would like all six of you to roll stealth checks for me if you could  travis 
none	 with triple advantage  matt no just the plus ten which is better than advantage  marisha triple advantage  travis 25  taliesin 30  marisha 28  liam 38  laura 30  matt 38  sam 14  laughter  matt with plus ten  sam with the plus ten  matt all right  travis incredible  sam tralalalala  matt so as the entire group bends down into a ninjalike stance just darting across as fast as  they can keeping low to the ground and using much of the shadow of the overhead clouds 
none	 and smoke  that has completely engulfed the above skyscape behind you bounding very loudly is a gentle  gnome swishing brown hair  sam im trying to do that thing that the ashari just did  matt right its not working  liam hot hot hot  matt and as youre darting across youre jumping over little open globules of molten lava that is  starting to pour out from various crevices in the stone floor you try to hop around to avoid that  and in doing so your foot catches the edge of a piece of stone 
none	 and you begin to go into a tumble  make an acrobatics check  sam oh yes mmhm oh disadvantage because im exhausted  matt you are  laura oh shit i forgot about that  liam the honest gnome  sam okay 14  matt laughs you do manage to catch yourself with a slight tumble skid a bit on your ass and  land on your feet it wouldve been a cool threepoint landing if anyone else had attempted  it but you just barely catch yourself look back at the group with a sheepish grin and out 
none	 of the  corner of your eye you see one of the undead entities turn its head and look right in your direction  laura whispering good job scanlan  sam whispering i think it saw grog  travis sorry  matt it starts wandering in your direction  sam should we engage or keep going  marisha im afraid if we engage it could draw attention to an entire slew of what could be  around  taliesin lets just put it down quietly  marisha all right jesus christ  taliesin no magic  laura no  taliesin 
none	 just weapons  laura no guns  taliesin no guns i pull my sword  marisha vex you might be the most capable of this  laura i shoot it with an arrow  matt all right roll for an attack  laura okay just going for it okay  travis wow  laura im literally i think i cursed myself sometime between here and san francisco  taliesin the d20s talk to each other and they know that youre not true  laura 18  matt 18 that hits go ahead and roll damage  liam can i attack 
none	 on her heels when shes done  matt at this distance itll take a little bit to rush up if you want to  liam 60 feet  matt ill say at this point theyre roughly 60 feet from you so if you wanted to  liam thats my distance  matt oh if you go full speed you can  marisha daggers  matt oh throwing it  laura 15 damage  matt 15 damage on which one the skeleton or  laura oh thats sneak attack right because im hidden  matt it would be from you yes 
none	 the  laura extra two  matt what extra two okay is this against one of the zombies or one of the skeletons  laura i was doing the one that was walking towards us i thought the other ones were still in  the area  matt all right then that would be one of the zombies  laura yeah okay  matt all right the arrow streaks through the air slamming into the chest and it embeds  itself causing a piece of tendon to snap and curl back inside the torso its arm falls a little more 
none	  limp than it was previously and it just keeps walking forward  laura i hide  matt all right go ahead and roll a stealth check you  liam theyre all grouped together  matt three of them are grouped together by the tree the one that noticed is slowly wandering  toward you  liam all right so im going to throw at that one as well  matt okay  laura 39 stealth  matt all right  liam im just going to throw one and just to check im hidden yeah  matt correct  liam 
none	 so this is assassinate i have advantage because it hasnt gone yet and its a crit  because im surprising it  matt mmhm  liam 25  matt 25 with that as this zombie entity is hobbling forward the dagger strikes it right in  the center of the skull right where its mouth and jaw hinge hit severs the base of the skull to the  spine and the head just rolls off onto the ground underneath the body takes two more steps before  falling forward  laura yeah do they all did any of the other 
none	 ones notice that  matt all the other undead creatures all of a sudden turn into the forest as opposed to towards where  the death happened  laura ah shit  matt and you see running out from the forest towards you a blueskinned humanoid rushing out  arms in the air  chris in an irish accent stop stop stop what youre doing stop it what have you done what  have you fucking done it wasnt hurting anybody i dont understand it jesus christ these are not  easy to make  travis are we killing this 
none	 one  sam no no dont kill him hes precious  chris what did i do  sam who are you who are you  chris who are you youre fucking shooting at me youre asking me questions  sam but these are zombies these are undead these are creatures of evil  laura they were attacking us they were attacking him  chris these were in my employ  sam oh  laura well you should keep a leash on them then  chris that would be inhumane wouldnt it  sam theyre not human  chris well they 
none	 were thats very disrespectful of you i dont appreciate it  liam are they pets are they friends where were you  chris theyre friendpets  liam you have to be around though to keep an eye on them  chris i know but ive been traveling out here for a while and so they provide a layer of  protection certainly not great now now they were four now theres three  liam well listen when we see these things without an owner around we take them out im  sorry its pretty standard  sam this cant be 
none	 the first time this has happened  chris it does happen quite a lot actually yes now that i think about it its probably a little  bit on me i suppose  sam can you make them vests or something that says service  chris thats a nice idea as im a vestmaker  laura put them in a bright color put a happy mask on them or something so people know theyre  nice  chris certainly yeah yeah masks and vests thats a great idea  matt you see agreeing before you a bluescaled dragonborn if you 
none	 would like to describe yourself  for the party  chris yes sorry i forgot where are my manners my name is gern blanston  sam no its not  chris its gern blanston  taliesin oh my god  chris this ones very rude  travis he is  chris you look exhausted  sam this volcano do you live near here this volcano really takes the piss out of you  chris no no no i dont live near here listen ive been traveling im a simple candlemaker  sam what are you doing on top of a 
none	 volcano  chris a volcano is natures candle what a stupid question  laura you make candles but you also make undead  chris yes theyre yes theyre like peoplecandles  laura can i insight and see if hes telling the truth  matt go for it  liam our lives are so bizarre now  laura 17  matt 17 hes telling the truth  chris why is my brain tingling is someone noodling around inside there  matt she eyes you up and down trying to get a feel for whether or not youre who you say you 
none	 are  chris i make special candles i make special candles im searching for some magical items up  here in this volcano i understand there was a wee bit of damage not long ago from a dragon that had  torn through the region and so im just searching for scraps to make these simple candles thats  why this is my dance vest i think dancing is very important im alone most of the time it  keeps me occupied they have no appreciation for the arts these undead creatures that are  friendpets and you know ive 
none	 just been digging around up here seeing what i can scrounge up and  find what are you lot  travis wait are they special candles or are they simple candles  chris well some are simple some just create light and others create tragedy for people  sam theyre magical candles  chris yes in a word actually magic is the perfect word  marisha who exactly is the patronage of your candle business who do you sell to  chris i mean i sell to no one in particular really i have to be a little choosy about 
none	 who  gets the candles but its something that ive crafted over the years  sam well we feel dreadful about killing one of your pets  marisha im so sorry  sam perhaps we can purchase a candle off of you to make amends  chris well maybe you could just kill someone else and then i could just bring them back i  mean that would be a wonderful way to repay  laura well you know what were on our way to do just that thing  chris really  marisha things do tend to die around 
town	 us a lot  travis something larger things sometimes smaller things  sam would you like a body to reanimate or something  marisha you might get something even bigger  chris are you inviting me to come along with you  sam i dont know are we  chris did i just invite myself to come along with you  travis well maybe like if you give us one of those tragedy candles we can always light it for  somebody that could be good down the road  marisha oh like candles for funerals thats sad we do 
none	 have a lot of tragedy  travis we bake somebody a cake we shove a candle in the top and we give it to them  chris i dont think that would be a grand idea unless you didnt like the person very much  travis well thats what i meant yeah  chris well i think for now ill just hold onto the candles i have and just see how things pan  out i really dont know any of you  sam were vox machina a traveling band of adventurers led by me scanlan shorthalt and  these 
none	 are my compatriots were on a very important mission to get what are we doing  marisha were trying to close this giant rift that were walking into  sam we have to break something big and scary  chris whats your name again  sam scanlan shorthalt  chris no whats the name of your group  laura vox machina  chris no offense but that sounds like a shite band  laura thank you  chris are you musicians  taliesin its better than tragedy candle really i mean thats a shite band to be fair  chris 
none	 laughs they opened for vox machina they were fantastic oh am i not thinking of the right  thing thats all right  sam im a musician  chris excellent  sam but these people they cant really hold a tune so much  chris listen seeing as how that youve killed one of my undead thralls itd be really nice if i  could join you to see if maybe we can scrounge up some other things along the way  laura then youll help us  chris i mean well see how it pans out but i feel 
none	 like everything would come to an abrupt  ending if i just walked away at this point  laura it would be very strange  chris thoroughly unsatisfying for anyone else who might be witnessing this exchange  sam your undead pets are they going to try and eat our brains or anything  chris no no theyre just fine that right there is coral and thats stimpy and thats fatty  arbuckle  sam who was the one that we killed  chris oh that was carol very sad very sad indeed  laura carol and coral  chris 
none	 carol and coral i get them confused  marisha were they sisters  chris no no no they were not initially related but we became a makeshift family after a  while  sam oh thats very beautiful  chris i notice subtle differences that most of the living doesnt notice  travis arent we supposed to be doing something really like  laura yeah tell you what gern were actually  liam its dangerous around us i dont know  laura we should probably press on and you can join us with your family  chris please that would 
none	 be very nice  travis what was your name one more time  chris gern blanston  travis yeah okay  chris gern  travis well lets go lets move along then gern yeah you good to come along with your herd of  sam can you fight and stuff in case shit goes down  marisha if you make magical candles you must know a little bit of magic correct  chris im a little bit better of a spellcaster than i am a fisticuffs type of person  marisha okay  laura perfect were short on magic people 
none	 thats wonderful  chris excellent no offense  sam all taken  travis we move along  laura are we still trying to stealth or does it even matter  liam your dead things dont stealth i would assume  chris theyre not very delicate unfortunately no no theyre really for protection now the  zombies can really take a lot of damage to the front of the chest and the skeletons are quite  quick actually so you know theyve been fairly good for a while  laura all right  taliesin good to know  laura we head 
none	 towards the thing  travis stealthily  chris to the thing  travis shush stealthily  chris whispering to the thing  matt go ahead and make a stealth check if you dont mind gern  laura does my pass without a trace work on him too does it like envelop him  matt nope he wasnt there when you cast it  chris 11  travis fuck  matt 11  taliesin hes not under pass without a trace  matt no and then no as you guys begin stealthily there is a couple of footfalls heavy  footfalls 
none	 of the lumbering dragonborn  chris these old dragon feet  matt no tail on this one  sam what happened to your tail  chris please dont ask me about that  sam okay i wont  matt the only other dragonborn youve seen without a tail was the paladin that worked in the  council tofor brotorus so that does catch your attention a little bit not just the dragonborn  lumbering but now the three undead that are groaning stepping behind  laura theyre worse than trinket scanlan  marisha i dont know i dont know if 
none	 stealth is going to be a thing going forward  taliesin whistling  travis yeah whistles  laura okay  chris sorry these dragon lips cant whistle mostly just fire comes out  matt and its at that point you hear the cracking of what sounds like heavy timber no more than 30  feet away from you you all stop in place suddenly and you glance over and you can see the flickering  of light of what appears to be a flamebased elemental energy thats tearing over the side of a  newly fallen petrifoid petrifoid mocking chris 
dung	 accent petrifoid tree look what youve  done to me this is your fault  travis gern son of a bitch  chris purple hearts green stars purple hearts  sam seen some shit  chris special veterans edition of lucky charms  matt very very lucky charms  chris very lucky charms  liam shit  matt so  taliesin well that got dark  matt yeah how about that  liam back to normal then eh  taliesin yeah okay  matt so as the flame begins to trickle and burn over the edge you can see there 
none	 is an  intelligence to it there are a couple of arms that writhe over the side and the head pops  over and glances and stops in place frozen staring over in the direction of the bounding  dragonborn  marisha its a fire elemental  matt its smaller than what youre used to seeing but it is indeed a creature made of  elemental flame  marisha would he be considered a primordial  matt it would be considered an elemental  marisha okay im going to go fire elemental  matt okay so youre using your transform 
none	  marisha seeing it im going to transform and go into my fire elemental  travis is this the first time youve done that  laura no no shes done that  marisha is this the first time ive been fire elemental  matt i think its the first time youve been fire elemental yeah  laura really  marisha yeah learned from cerkonos yeah  matt so you guys watch as keyleths form suddenly erupts into flame which freaks you out  for a second as youre uncertain as to whether or not she did that  travis keyleth 
none	 are you all right  marisha in fire elemental just like  laura does it still look like keyleth or what does it look like  matt it has for a moment an essence of keyleths more lithe form that most elementals would but  still these long curling flame likearms these eyes that glow a bright white fire in the center  of the face other than that relatively formless other than what looks like where her hair would  be these wisps of flame curl up behind her  laura pretty freaking sick can you talk to it 
none	  marisha thats what im going to go do  matt so as you approach the elemental form  marisha so i approach and im going to do the animal instinct thing and poof up and make myself  a little big  matt the creature behind the form you can see is drifting away from the trunk of the tree  marisha oh its running from me  matt its turned away and is moving away from you yeah  sam that was easy  marisha deuces and i roll back  laura i thought we were supposed to 
none	 keep them from coming out into this world  marisha are we wait are we in the fire plane yet  matt no no youre just youre in the caldera to  marisha oh were in the caldera  matt yeah you havent traversed the plane youre making your way into the remnants of the  cindergrove  laura maybe you should ask it to go back  marisha okay im going to say halt in ignan which im assuming it speaks  matt you guys hear in the distance this echo of this weird suckingcrackling sound that goes it 
none	  halts for a second looks over its shoulder and then goes into double speed disappearing into the  trees away from you  travis kind of following your lead here  marisha i follow after it and i say in the name of the guardians of this realm you will stop  matt okay as you follow it past the initial treeline its where a bunch of trees have fallen  over and formed a small blockade in this portion of the forest you glance over as youre shouting  that and you can see what appear to be 
none	 another of the same small elemental that this one has gone  to to have a brief conversation beyond that you see a larger one roughly your size that has just  turned around and noticed your presence and all of them look over at what appears to be another  humanoid creature but instead of a lower torso of legs its an elongated snakelike body its black  and red scales across its entire form two human arms and a humanoid face but these webbed red  spines down its entire back  sam gern is that one of 
none	 yours thats you gern gern  chris no i dont know who this is i dont im not familiar im not familiar with who this is  laura i take my potion of fire resistance  chris i could send them a present in the form of a candle if you prefer  laura do it  matt at this point in time keyleth as youre standing there looking over this edge they all  turn and the creature the weird ill say it a salamanderlike creature begins shouting out  phrases in ignan which you understand it says go 
none	 hes not here yet alleviate this  uncontrolled one at which point they all begin to swarm towards you  marisha at which point im going to do a fire intimidation tactic im going to do a fire radial  thing and im going to say as the leader of this realm as the kaitaki of the fire nation you will  heed my word  chris quite dramatic isnt she  matt as you guys are watching this from a distance all you hear is guttural noises its  really confusing and a little hilarious to be honest

none	 i serve for i am above him i am your master now this is not your  realm get back into the fire plane where you came from  matt he looks back at the long snakelike humanoid whos standing there who glances at the  other one and goes she wants us back very well and they all turn around and begin to  slowly drift back towards the center of the cindergrove where the flickering light was  marisha holy shit  laura good job keyleth  travis we dont know what happened why are we clapping  
none	 laura theyre turning around theyre heading back in that direction  marisha i fly back over to them still in fire elemental form  liam whoa whoa whoa  marisha and im like you guys did you see that it was really crazy did you see did you see  they think im their leader they think im their god  travis is she talking in normal or is she talking in the flickering flames  matt flickering flames  travis yeah no idea what youre doing or saying  laura youre very scary right now dear  chris is

none	 and keep watching him can i see what it was  matt you have no idea you just see a little cluster of ash and dust on the ground thats been  partially disturbed all right as you continue to press forward you hear in the distance a loud  cracking sound echoing and you can see what appear to be a number of trees in the faroff side  to the northeastern side of the forest as a brief whirlwind flickers up you assume this is probably  from the fire ashari whove taken that side of the entranceway 
none	 and you can see two flickering  lights drift up in the air before sparking out in the distance  travis ooh really  laura should we let them know were in place then  marisha ill throw up a skywrite or actually as a fire elemental can i just be like fire flares  in fire elemental form  matt i mean you can make some localized fire happen  marisha can i send up a little bit like a flare  matt not in the way you would want to youd have to drop form for that and 
none	 cast a spell  marisha fuck  laura im going to set an arrow on fire and shoot it up in the air  marisha i dont realize shes doing it  matt okay as you go ahead and take the arrow what do you have around the edge that are going  to are you just going to light the shaft on fire  laura no im going to tie some of my cloth from you know that i have the thing  travis yeah  laura i take some cloth from the bag of holding from one of

none	 for team threes response  sam theres a third team  marisha right theres a third team three teams right  laura all the other teams already responded we were the third  marisha oh one two we were three okay yeah  matt okay you begin to push further forward towards the center of the cindergrove as youre  noticing more and more of these trees are pushed flat its almost like that russian forest the  meteor had landed in and exploded all the trees are flattened  chris tunguska  matt think tunguska thank you where you 
none	 begin to climb over a number of these flattened portions  of the forest and in the center you can see that one river of molten rock that had been trickling  down the front of the mountain is sourced here in the center where once previously you guys had  performed a ritual to pass into the elemental plane has now torn into this extremely bright rift  that flickers its like looking into the sun you have to avert your gaze you cannot look directly  at it without actually hurting your eyesight and you can see there 
none	 are multiple paths of this  molten lava pouring out from this new volcanic activity you can see it burbling up and bubbling  underneath like the very presence of this tear itself is causing the activity to just raise and  grow more fervent at the base of the rift you can see a number of other elemental creatures that  are in the process of surrounding this opening  door creak  matt  and you can everything all right ryan  ryan i am not here  matt youre not here okay  sam you dont know 
none	  matt i dont know  chris you guys see him too  matt perfect as you can see all these elemental entities are swirling around there are two more  of these strange snakelike humans these salamanderlike creatures that are discussing and  one really large one that stands there holding this strange tridentlike structure and its  shouting out commands left and right and you can see these salamander entities and a number of  these elementals are all gathered around the portal and theyre all just focusing this slow  steady beam towards it and as you 
none	 can see it tearing flickering and slowly expanding with each  popping expansion of this doorway the ground itself shifts and rumbles  laura i hunters mark the big one  matt all right  chris can i send a candle  matt if youd like to yeah  chris all right what am i looking at here fire theres a bit of fire  matt theres a lot of fire most of these entities are either fire essence or just made out  of straight flame  chris id like to call over the skeleton known as fatty arbuckle 
none	 id like to give fatty arbuckle an  ice storm candle  matt all right  chris and ask him to kindly deliver it to the center of this melee thats happening just up  ahead  sam wont that kill your friend  chris oh hes had a good run  taliesin im feeling a lot less guilty suddenly  chris well i can do it what i dont appreciate is when other people do it  sam thats fair thats fair  chris you know its my choice never said it was okay for you to start lighting 
none	 them up with  arrows jesus christ whoever that is  laura im vexahlia nice to meet you  matt fatty arbuckle skeletal claws clasped around the side of this marbledlooking  bluishwhite candle and clutches it and just goes snarl  chris yes off you trot go  sam you dont have to demean him as he goes  taliesin i was really hoping for a fatty arbuckle skeleton impression i was really really hoping  for it what you did was cool but like that was just my heart  chris they cant speak they dont have voice 
dung	 boxes or anything  matt as it shuffles forward down this ashen pit towards the dome where the lava itself is  beginning to pour forth and the doorway is you can see the shadow of its form as the light  passes it looks like the cover of the thing how its just bright light coursing past this dark  image of the skeleton walking away from you  laura maybe we should duck down so that nobody knows where that came from  chris oh yes get ten feet back i shouldve said that already  matt its 
none	 walked quite a distance thankfully at this point its probably a good 40 or 50 feet  before it reaches the first salamander and you see as it begins to step forward they all turn  and look and one of them shouts over snarling one of them glances over reaches out and pulls  out a long brasscolored longbow and begins to notch an arrow carefully as it hobbles forward  they look at each other one of them shouts out in ignan which you understand keyleth shouting  you who walks here just keeps walking forward like a 
none	 little windup toy made of bone until  eventually the one with the bow gives a nudge with its head and the other salamander entity  draws a heavybladed object and begins to step forward towards it ready to go ahead and cleave  it as the skeleton steps forward it gets right at the corner of its range do you want to command it  marisha i feel like helen hunt in that moment in twister  chris squeeze the candle fatty arbuckle  matt at which point the skeleton just as the blade sweeps past and crashes into 
none	 its torso  shattering the rib cage the arms go crack the wax bends and cracks in the center and theres a  brief pause where nothing seems to happen and a swirl of sudden localized storming blizzard just  encases a tenfoot radius hitting both of those salamander creatures what does it say on the  candle specifically  chris on the ice storm candle all affected must make a dexterity saving throw dc 12 or suffer  4d6 cold damage  matt thats a fail and a save and its half damage on success  chris half damage 
none	 on success  matt great okay so one of them failed and one of them saved so go ahead and roll 4d6 damage  travis dang i think thats a good way to start  chris thank you thank you thank you oh boy three six nine  matt nine okay nine and five cold damage to each so bang it blasts open oh and a dexterity  check for your buddy who makes it so fatty arbuckle actually walks out of there with a mere  five points of cold damage  laura nice fatty  matt out of 
none	 ice and frost his bustedopen rib cage though he did suffer  liam super duper  travis putting on the ritz  matt did suffer seven damage from the impact of this weapon so fatty arbuckle pretty damaged  but still standing there just going snarling  chris keep standing fatty you can do it i love you fatty  matt is everyone just going to sit back at this or  laura no we should probably attack  matt its up to you or you can watch this horrible bludgeoning of this skeleton in the teeth  of death 
none	  travis when i see the salamander take out the big shiny sharp thing i go into a rage  laura i hide  matt all right travis i assume youre going to be rushing in there then  travis yeah  matt anyone who wishes to immediately go into battle now lets roll initiative  taliesin all right im in on this  matt all right let me go ahead and  sam for fatty  marisha so these are all fire elementals should i continue  taliesin oh hell yeah  chris ah nice  laura should we 
none	 roll for stealth again or are we still stealthed  chris i was just shouting at a skeleton  laura oh i know i was trying to hide though like back away from you as you were doing that  travis the candle turned into a blizzard so ooh  taliesin is it a candle though its like a thing like theres no  liam and i mean gern was shouting  taliesin its a candle the way the wheelie things are hoverboards i think its weird  chris and they also catch on fire they also explode  matt 
none	 all right so this is quite a ways away from the portal itself lava flow traveling around that side  taliesin oh look at that  matt all right and we have keyleth over here as the fire elemental  laura youre at the portal  marisha huh  laura thats okay were all going to die  travis no  taliesin wheres the big one  matt the big one that you havent seen yet  laura the big one that i hunters marked  taliesin that one the one holding the tridenty thing  matt oh sorry

none	 where is that on the map  matt its back its this far back  liam way back okay  travis that craters just a crater though  matt yeah there is a pool of magma that goes this way you guys are on one side of it and  pushing this way further the rest of the actual portals back this far all right so initiative  order we have 25 to 20 anyone  sam 22  taliesin 27  travis fucking percy jesus every time you motherfucker  taliesin im fast as fuck  matt okay 20

none	 shot to the  one with the trident  matt all righty  taliesin that was my first shot and thats 25  matt 25 hits  taliesin and thats a strength saving throw  matt strength saving throw that is going to be a 20  taliesin that just barely makes it  matt aw the blast of your impact bang hits the arm he manages to hold onto his  tridentlike weapon  taliesin thats fine hes going to take his damage and then hes going to take another one of  those because eff that  matt 
none	 all righty so go ahead and roll damage on that  travis because eff that  taliesin thats 13 points of damage  matt 13 points of damage all righty  taliesin all right im going to take another shot  matt go for it scanlan youre up on deck by the way so be ready  taliesin 20  matt 20 hits  taliesin strength check  matt thats a nine  taliesin he dropped that  matt failure gunshot you see his fingers are pried off as one of his pinky fingers is actually  blown off from 
dung	 the impact shooting dark deep crimson blood that seems to burn the landscape  around as it drips the trident tumbling to the ground and getting lodged in a piece of rock  almost ready to spill into part of the lava  taliesin and that does seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage all righty  taliesin third shots going to be a sharpshooter shot  matt all righty so minus five to the attack  taliesin thats probably going to miss 14  matt 14 unfortunately misses  taliesin all right that misses im going 
none	 to take a run behind and hide behind that rock  outcropping  matt there okay got it scanlan youre up  sam do i see that big thing in the back  matt this big thing here yeah the fire elemental you see that  sam okay and the thing next to fatty arbuckle is also a baddie yeah theyre all baddies  matt these things are all baddies here  sam all right im going to take 15 feet step to my right to put me in a straight line with the guy  next to fatty and 
none	 the big guy behind him and then fire a lightning bolt straight ahead to hit both  of them i hope theyre not immune to lightning well find out  matt all righty so and you watch out of the corner as well gern you see this tiny little  gnome step to the side conjure some arcane purplishblue energy and then thrust his pelvis  forward as a bolt of lightning energy just rockets forth tearing  sam from my penis  chris nice of course  sam just felt like i had to make that clear  chris 
none	 oh i dont think ive ever seen that happen before  taliesin we have  laura so many times  chris have to get that looked at  matt slamming both into the larger salamander creature and the elemental behind it go ahead and  roll 8d6 damage whats the dc on this  sam is it my spell save dc  matt yes  sam with the handcone  matt yeah  sam 20  matt ooh that is a failure and a failure  travis yes  matt all right so full damage against both  sam 27 
none	  matt oof all righty as the bolt of lightning energy tears through both of them eventually  absorbed into the stone behind them the elemental flame form flickers and falls to the ground for a  second trying to reform itself while the salamander looks down at this blackened burned  char mark in the center of its torso from where the bolt entered and exited out of its back to  strike its compadre not too happy and confused how such a large damaging thing came from such a  small little creature  sam its powerful then 
none	 ill turn to our new friend gern and i will inspire him ill say  please help us and to inspire you i will sing you a song and i will sing  chris pretty inspired by your dick lightning to be honest  sam oh theres more  chris you think a songs going to get better than that  sam it might it might and so i sing singing to everything gern gern gern there is a  season gern gern gern i just like to sing your name gern blanston did that help  chris do i 
none	 have to roll to determine if that was helpful or not  matt if youd like to  chris certainly  matt roll a d20 for musical taste  chris four  matt four it catches you by the ear with delight  chris its not bad actually its not bad  matt your general frustration with modern music is completely bisected by the more oldies  classical sound of his tune  chris i quite enjoyed how you worked my first name into that actually  no ones ever done that before  matt so you get a d10 
none	 inspiration dice  chris all right  matt so just keep that on the side if ever you make an attack roll or a saving throw that isnt  as high as you want it to be you can then roll that and add the d10 to that roll  chris okay great  matt so you just have that in the wings as you feel inspired  taliesin well try and remind you if something affects it  chris thank you very much excellent  matt all right that brings it to the elementals turn now this flame elemental 
none	 is going to streak  over whoosh to blern whos or no sorry this is to fatty arbuckle theres too many weird names  tonight and this larger fire elemental here is going to  chris oh fatty he served me well  sam i dont know hes got a fighting chance i love that we were scrambling for d6s when we have  this right in front of us  chris are there any dice around anywhere  sam where are we going to find  taliesin im just waiting for the hand to go in and just  
none	 chris i found this polyhedral vase and i had to fill it with nine pounds of dice  travis he went the long way  matt hes not doing anything he used his whole round to get there  travis oh okay  matt but now as the larger elemental burns into the center of scanlan percy you can feel just  his presence itself is extremely dangerously hot the air around you is blistering you can feel  your hair curl back in its presence the small elemental is going to go ahead and make two  attacks against 
none	 fatty arbuckle  chris ah shite  matt thats going to be a nine to hit i think his acs 13 so i dont think its going to hit  yeah second one rolls a one  sam fatty lives  travis fatty just dont want to die  taliesin cant keep fatty down  liam bob and weave fatty bob and weave  chris dont step too hard fatty you wont be able to take it  matt and with that grog its your turn so you go into your rage at the top of your turn and  
none	 then what would you like to do  travis can i use i guess my entire action to run towards scanlan  matt whats your speed again  travis 50  matt five ten 15 20 25 30 35 40 you can get right there between scanlan and this creature  if you want to  travis thats about it huh  matt id say thats your movement you can move ten more feet if you want to  sam you can leap over me  travis nah we need to spread out can i go back and arc the 
none	 other way can i run to the left as  far as i can  matt this way  travis no from where my starting point was  matt oh you mean like this way instead  travis yeah yeah back towards you around the pool  matt thats about as far as you can get right there if you do not attack anything you would  lose your rage  travis i fall out of my rage yeah so i fall out of it can i throw something i guess i can yeah  matt you can throw your 
none	 weapon if you want to  travis can i attach the chain of returning to craven edge and ill throw it at tridentless  bastard right there yeah  matt go for it so you watch as this musclebound goliath comes leaping around the corner as it  affixes a chain to the edge of its weapon flinging a twohanded sword like a giant boomerang and  travis only 14  matt 14 against the larger one  travis yeah  matt unfortunately it makes an impact but it just ricochets off of its plated body armor and  then 
none	 tumbles to the ground you can go ahead and make your  travis thing to pull it back strength 18  matt okay no problem you pull it back with the chain and catch it midair ending your turn there  travis keeping my rage  matt indeed vax youre up  liam all right so i rev up the boots of haste and im going to run right next to vexahlia on  the very edge of the map and the fire elemental theres right up against percy right  matt yep  liam all right im going to 
none	 stab him three times in his fire buttocks first one is a 27  matt that hits  liam second one is a 16  matt hits  liam third is a 14  matt hits  liam hits okay so first ones sneak attack so shite an eight ill add that on at the end  here come the dice two four seven ten 16 21 27 28 28 plus two is 30 36 for that first with  sneak attack damage  matt oof his form flickers briefly for a moment from the sheer impact of the dagger 
none	 hit  liam second dagger does seven and third swipe does nine  matt nine all righty the two other daggers impact partially passing through its form not  quite as impactful as the first that first one did seemingly cause the creature to have a hard  time coalescing its firewreathed physicality that ends your turn vax  liam yes  matt gern youre up so youre right there  chris im right there how far can i run and cast a spell at the ones around fatty  matt 30 feet is how far you can run and 
none	 thats about six squares  chris if i were to cast a bit of how about a cone of cold could i cast a cone of cold at the  fire elementals  matt you could you could very much so  liam that sounds delightful  chris i could cast ice storm but thats a general malaise of middleaged couples living in a  neighborhood becoming aware of their deadend lives  matt all right so you want to move around here  chris yes lets move around that bit right there and id like to cast cone of 
none	 cold i might  unfortunately have to take out fatty but  matt yeah theres probably a good chance this is not going to be after everything else fattys  survived his own master deals him the possible finishing blow  chris i feel like i should be the one to do it  sam of course  chris its much more humane  sam its poetic  chris i think so  marisha you brought him into this world  chris this is what fatty wouldve wanted  matt everything under that area gets affected so yeah you could 
none	 do that  chris yeah dont worry about it its fine no big thing this old spell i mean  liam yall want to go to the dq and get a cone of cold  matt whats your spell dc it should be at the top of your spell page  chris it is 16  matt 16 all right and it is a constitution save lets see if they make it that is a  failure a failure and a failure  sam what about fatty did he succeed  matt oh ill roll for fatty fatty does not 
none	 succeed nope  laura it was inevitable  matt nope all right go ahead and roll 8d8 points of cold damage  sam jeez oh man these are not used a lot  chris i have four lets see i have a whole theres another one here theyre not that easy  to get to two four six i need two more  sam two more good gravy  chris is this one  sam yep  chris heres one and doh  laura this is why i sort my dice at the beginning of the game  chris sorry

none	 hell in  front of him it comes scattering across this way freezing the corner of this turning partially  some of the lava here to stone just by proximity blasts past these entities and as the arcane snow  comes to rest you can see the fire elemental here itself is having a hard time keeping itself  together its flame is whoosh sputtering and flickering barely keeping itself together  however by its side you see three very still frozensolid statuettes of the remnants of the two  salamanders and fatty arbuckle taken by the cold of winter 
none	  marisha oh shit that was awesome  sam maybe you can reanimate him  chris its too late hes no good any longer  sam freezer burn  chris move on i have  matt well say for the purposes of remembering that too put a couple of  frozen frozen and frozen  chris singing let it go let it go  matt all right i believe that ends your turn gern all right it would be the salamanders  turn but theyre frozen damn they got pummeled vex youre up  laura awesome wait so they can

none	 party as the humanoid  floating about five feet off the ground his lower form just this swirl of cinders and black ash  chuckles with his arms crossed points forward and the elementals begin moving forward  marisha can keyleth do a quick ancillary action before shit happens  matt well this would be the initiative order now so everyone roll initiative  liam maybe they see something behind us  travis fuck  marisha jesus sucking it up today  matt all right folks this brings us to 25 to 20  liam 20  sam hey

none	 very smart  matt laughs and as you say that you recognize this entity and blurt out its name just  instinctually as you get a proper view of it one of the many denizens of the fire elemental plane  this is an efreeti it is a fire genie  sam a nefreeti  matt efreeti yes the species is efreeti but an eefrit eefreet however you want to pronounce  it a flame genie generally hailing from the city of brass andor spaces around and in the fire  elemental plane  taliesin i could feel it from 
none	 that side  liam i was thinking it  taliesin yeah i know i could feel it  matt floats above all of you arms still crossed opens its arms and as it chuckles both hands just  are engulfed in flames that congeal into these large fiery balls as it flings them both down in  the direction of the party  travis feel like were in megaman a megaman boss  marisha laughs yeah  matt this is going to be at scanlan and vex  laura what  sam these are fireballs right  matt to scanlan 
none	 that is 13  sam no way  matt vex that is 15  laura no  matt both just fireball impacts cracking into the ground to the sides of where youre standing  barely missing them it keeps glaring down at the rest of you with a smile ending that it brings  us to vax youre up  liam i got a high stealth right beforehand so am i hidden at the moment  matt as far as you know depending on the individual you dont know who saw you  and who didnt  liam as far 
none	 as i know all right balls im just going to throw three daggers at the salamander  right from where i am  matt right from where you are all right  liam yeah okay so first is a 20 second is a 14 third is a 19  matt okay the first one was what  liam 20  matt the first and the third hit if you are hidden though which you would technically be  hidden from this individual you do have advantage on those attacks so you can reroll the  liam and if im hidden 
none	 its a surprise right on that guy you tell me  matt no no its a sneak attack if youre hidden a surprise round is if they have no idea  that youre there  liam okay i thought it was a okay great fine love it okay so  laura you have advantage so maybe one of those would be a 20 if you rerolled them with their  advantages  liam all right no and other one no so four eight 12 13 16 20 31 35 for the first and  the second one is a ten 
none	  travis kick us off strong  matt not bad flinging both daggers one strikes it square in the sternum and the blade cracks and  pops as it hits the center of the chest it gurgle you know it cant make any sound as it  disappears from the wound returning to your belt the second dagger manages to come towards it  tries to parry out of the air but in doing so just gets it embedded in its forearm and it  shrieks out in pain as that too vanishes and appears once again in your belt 
none	 are you going to move  or stay where you are  liam im going to move im going to skip to my right and stand behind grog and spank him on the  ass and say go get em tiger  matt go get em tiger right there all righty  travis my names grog  matt vex youre up  laura are those trees do they have any substance at all or are they just there to look pretty  matt i mean you could get behind them if you want to theyre maybe about that wide  
none	 liam theyre like charlie brown christmas trees  matt practically as far as the cindergroves concerned theyre pretty sadlooking a lot of them have  been destroyed and torn and pushed down around  laura all right im going to try to use one as protection im going to hop behind  the one over this way  matt this way here  laura and im going to hunters mark the efreeti  matt all righty mark the efreeti  laura and then im going to use my longbow of the sky sentinel and im going to  shoot him 
none	 three times  matt go for it  laura that first one probably does not succeed it is a 16  matt that does not hit nope  laura what about 23  matt that does hit  laura all right how about mega miss so one of those hits because im a loser  matt streaking past and the third one hits as hes holding the flame balls in his hands seeing  the small impact he just glares at you though the impact  travis you need to sacrifice a small mammal maybe we can find a squirrel 
none	 or something  laura 11  travis a pagan ritual  taliesin i can hook you up i have a kit  travis laughter why am i not surprised  laura 17 points of damage and thats it because i suck  matt 17 points of damage and you are hiding behind the tree  laura i am hiding behind the tree  matt thats the end of vexs turn it is now the elementals turns  laura these pieceofshit dice  matt this is going to move in and actually consumes the space of gern and his followers  
none	 taliesin thats not even a figurine its just a chunk of plastic  matt so as youre sitting there you just see this fire elemental just streak around real fast  and all of a sudden step into the space where you and your two undead followers are flames whirling  around you all of you immediately take five points of fire damage you and your two allies  stimpy and coral poor guys  chris werent there oh they killed one thats right and you guys fucking killed one too  matt with that its going to make two 
none	 strikes towards you gern the fire elemental rushes in  and just slithering fire noises  chris not the vest not the vest  matt that is going to be a 13 to hit whats your armor class  chris 13  matt just hits you and thats a natural 20  sighs and groans  matt so you take 14 points of fire damage from the first one  chris doesnt feel very natural  liam thanks for coming thanks for playing  matt 19 points of fire damage from the second strike and you are currently engulfed in 
none	 flame  you caught fire from the impact with the fire elemental  chris it doesnt hurt im fine im fine im part dragon  laura do dragonborn have natural fire resistance  matt certain ones do not blue ones  laura oh no  chris if it was lightning itd be fine but no  matt that ends that elementals turn this one is going to step into the space where both percy and  scanlan are both of you guys immediately suffer seven points of fire damage  taliesin im halved because i have resistance  matt correct 
none	 so youd take three points and its going to make a strike on each of you thats  going to be a 14 versus you scanlan  sam that does not hit me  matt and then versus percy same roll 14  taliesin laughter ah youre adorable  matt misses you both with a series of terrible attacks that ends their turn gern youre up at  the start of your turn  chris its my turn  taliesin but first you have to take your fire damage  chris oh im still on fire  matt yep at 
none	 the top of your turn because youre now on fire you take six points of fire damage  youre just wreathed in fire all around its a bad bad sunday for gern  chris oh boy im trying to find something that wont destroy how close is everyone to me  everyones pretty close  sam no ones near the big guy  chris no but im standing right there  taliesin here you can see it right here youre that little red ring right there and then your  two followers are right there if you have anything that 
none	 goes in a cube youd be fine do  you have anything thats a cube shot  chris and which way am i facing  taliesin whichever way you want to be facing  chris i mean i guess id like to run around and throw another cone of cold aimed at that guy  and then up at the prick hovering above everyone  matt this direction you mean  chris yes aye  matt so you can move around to this side of the elemental pushing past your allies whip around  you get a little bit of 
none	 a view through the fire and flames swirling around you you concentrate and  release a burst of cold energy it might not be close enough  chris of course it is  matt itll be enough to get those two there  chris all right well i suppose thats better than nothing at all  sam thats impressive  matt its better than nothing all right so constitution saves on the elemental  whats your dc  chris 16  matt 16 it fails on the salamander thats another big fail with a 13 so go ahead  and 
dung	 roll 8d8 damage  chris counting 40 im sorry what was that last one shit 35  matt nice 35 points of cold damage to both the salamander and the elemental in front of you  great so you see as a blast of winter arcane energy just skirts forward casting most of the  dark area here in snow and ice and sleet you can see the front of this lava pond is cooled for the  moment and actually can be walked across probably for one or two more rounds  chris youre welcome  liam youre still 
none	 on fire by the way  matt yes you are also still on fire someone has to take an action to try and douse the  flames on him whether it be himself or possibly your allies you can still give actions to your  two undead buddies  chris oh in that case i think id like to ask the zombie character who i believe was no  stimpy was the skeleton this is coral id like to have coral rip is my skin on fire or is it  just my vest  matt both actually the scales 
none	 are starting to crisp  chris those are really hard to get  sam the vest  chris yes  taliesin you could just have them swat you like zombie grunting noises  chris i need to have the zombie hurl its body on top of me onto the ground and roll around on me  to get the flame off its a very stinky enterprise  matt okay ill allow this youre intentionally going prone so you start your next  combat round on the ground which means youll have half your movement as stimpy hobbles over  zombie 
none	 groan  sam this is coral  chris is there like snow or ice on the ground  matt there is behind the elemental yes  chris can he scoop some up  matt the zombie can take one action unfortunately its not a super intelligent  creature one or the other  chris all right then i suppose he just has to roll on top of me  matt you guys glance over out of the corner of your eye and you see is the dragonborn all of  a sudden jumps to the ground sprawled out snow angel 
none	 style  chris do it just do it already what are you waiting for  matt as this undead begins flailing about on top of his body youre starting to get elements of  decaying goo and  chris yes its fucking terrible  matt but the flames do eventually go out over the next five to six seconds or so what would you  like stimpy to do  chris i mean i guess i would have to give him a candle wouldnt i  matt you would yes  chris right maybe he just scoops up as much 
none	 ice and snow as possible and attacks the  matt sure  sam snowball fight  chris snowball fight  matt he picks up some of the frost on the ground with his skeletal hands flings it funnily  enough it hits  chris fuck yeah it does  matt because its right there well say for that particular instance it takes  chris what like a hundred points of damage  matt three points of cold damage  cheers  matt immediate steam in the face of a fire elemental  chris i smell like cooked cow anus at 
none	 the moment  matt percy youre up  taliesin weird question what saving throw does a creature have to make with your sword  travis wisdom  taliesin its a wisdom saving throw  matt no its constitution  taliesin constitution saving throw good to know  travis i just answered the first thing that popped into my head  taliesin that was wisdom fascinating okay im right in the thick of it arent it  matt yes  taliesin im going to break away ill take the hit i dont like attacking these  things straight on  matt 
none	 at the top of your turn by the way you take nine points of fire damage down to four  because you are also engulfed in flame as is scanlan for having passed over the space there  taliesin nine points of fire damage down to four okay im going to break away and take a run  for it towards that crater in the far right corner  matt this way here  taliesin thank you yes  matt running past the fire elemental it does get an attack of opportunity on you swinging out with  its flaming 
none	 appendage that is going to be a 13 to hit  taliesin that aint going to hit thats fine im going to take my bonus action and im going  to cast hex on it  matt on which one  taliesin on the one i just ran away from  matt okay that elemental is now currently hexed  taliesin with a disadvantage on constitution saving throws  matt oh okay  travis hey  taliesin teamwork  travis i dont think he has any blood though  matt is it saving throws or is it ability checks  
none	 taliesin ability checks  matt that does not affect saving throws unfortunately  taliesin god damn it all right never mind thats fine since ive broken off from him im  going to take some shots at him anyway ill take three shots  matt go for it  taliesin first one is an 18  matt 18 hits  taliesin thats seven points of damage second ones a sharpshooter thats 25  matt 25 and with that shot boom  cheering  travis jeez leave some for the rest of us big boy  marisha oh wait why did 
none	 it go back  matt sorry this is the one that took all the damage from the cone of cold so this one is still  fine robbed you of victory  chris that was so weird he disappeared for a moment and then came right back  taliesin i havent actually damaged him yet have i  matt you did seven damage  taliesin that was the first damage the second damage i havent done yet  matt no you have not  taliesin 20 points of damage  matt all right nice youre adding your hexes to this 
none	 right  taliesin no im not oh shit  matt add d6 to each of these buddy  taliesin so thats six extra points and thats seven extra points total third sharpshooter shot  thank you for reminding me on the hex thats a 12 thats going to miss  matt 12 misses unfortunately you shoot too far it actually separates its body for a second the  flames flickering away from the impact of the bullet passing through no effect  unfortunately  taliesin weird thing can i spend an action surge and put myself out of the fire 
none	  matt you can  taliesin you know what its just fire i will be on fire  matt you will be on fire percy  taliesin im going to be on fire  marisha its just fire  matt scanlan youre up  sam what is holding the thing thats floating in the sky aloft is he flying is he supported on a  column of fire  chris no hes brought a plastic shelf with himself apparently  sam oh of course  chris hes just standing on it  matt its ikeamade you just have to build 
none	 it  travis its the schlogel  matt it appears to be flying the very essence of this creature is partial flame and magic and its  levitating as its lower form is a tiny dervish whirlwind of black ash and flame  sam and hes a larger creature or smaller  matt large  sam hes a large creature or smaller okay im going to make him the boy in the bubble i will  cast otilukes resilient sphere  taliesin yay  marisha what is that  sam im going to make a bubble around him  matt 
none	 first you take four points of fire damage because youre on fire  sam oh sure whatever no wait but it was nine right you said just four  matt that was when it originally got to you and then youre still burning every turn until you put  yourself out the range on the resilient sphere is 30 feet so youre going to want to get closer to  cast it  sam oh okay ill walk hes going to hit me isnt he  matt this is cool currently if you want to go across you can get 
none	 there and thatll be enough  distance  sam ill do that and then straight up in the air  matt okay so it has to make a dexterity saving throw whats the dc the dc on your spells is a  20 right now right  sam it is  taliesin wow  matt and it rolled a 19 18 plus one  laura oh my gosh  matt and with that suddenly you guys see scanlan concentrate shouting the magical  incantation through the hand cone  sam youre in a ball motherfucker  matt you see a 
none	 pinkpurplehued globe of crystalline magical arcane energy just form  around the creature and the efreet goes grunting  sam does he fall or can he continue to fly  matt the sphere is weightless so no he stays where he is  liam and is it a good witch or a bad witch  taliesin science check does oxygen penetrate the sphere  sam there is still air inside  taliesin damn it because that wouldve been amazing if he just died  chris i was looking away what just happened  sam oh fuck  chris what  
none	 sam always look at me  chris oh i was looking at some grubs over by the  travis grubs  chris im hungry  sam oh and ill turn around and i will heal gern because hes not doing great with my bonus  action at a second level i will cast healing word and i will sing to him again because he loves it  so much  chris you know i think im fine with 26 hit points  sam singing gern baby gern candle inferno gern baby gern burn that mother down  matt all right 
none	 second level thats 2d4 plus  sam five  matt 2d4 plus five you heal  chris oh do i roll that  sam do i roll or does he  matt whichever one doesnt matter to me  chris okay so nine  matt all right scanlan i believe that ends your turn keyleth youre up  chris thank you i will never again not watch your spellcasting you tiny bundle of adorable  creature  marisha is that guy and that guy within 30 feet of each other its hard to tell with the thing on it  
none	 matt there is 30 feet between them yes  marisha a 30 foot long spell could hit both of them correct  matt a 30 foot long spell could it could only hit one its 30 feet between them  marisha okay but this guy oh damn it what about this guy and this guy theyre within 30  feet right  matt 35 between them these two there is definitely  marisha actually yeah let me do that i am going to cast a tidal wave right here and im  going to go outward in this direction and 
none	 its ten foot wide and 30 foot long so let me back up  a little bit out of it  matt so its ten feet wide and itll go rushing water like that you mean  marisha yeah  matt okay so you back up to there  marisha yes  matt all right okay dexterity save on each of them dexterity save on the first one  marisha since its water do they have disadvantage  matt no not for the saving throw the first one does make the saving throw however that is a 19  plus 
none	 three so 22 on a success it takes half as much damage and isnt knocked prone so it takes  half the other one however does fail  marisha do they take more damage because its water  matt how much is in the spell  marisha it does 4d8 damage  matt right go ahead and roll that id say how many gallons would that be  thats a shitton of gallons  marisha ooh thats good 12 plus eight is 20 plus another eight is 28 math  taliesin thats a d8 there  matt 14 okay so 
none	 thats 14 and 28 id say that tidal wave how many gallons of water would we say  each one of those is  marisha its 30 foot tall  matt well its ten foot tall ten foot wide so thats  marisha and 30 feet long  taliesin four gallons easily  matt id say were looking at close to 50 gallons of water right  taliesin probably way more than 50 gallons  laura thats a lot of gallons for sure  chris i think its like a million gallons  sam somewhere between 50 and a million 
none	  marisha why didnt we switch to metric  taliesin it would be a few hundred gallons of water  matt well say for the purposes of this for the width of it and the space you had to pass it  through well say roughly 60 gallons of water passes through each of these elementals water  susceptibility for every five feet the elemental moves in water or for every gallon of water  splashed on it it takes one point of cold damage so they both take an additional 60 points of  damage which destroys both of 
none	 the elementals  laura fuck yeah do that again keyleth  marisha okay i will  taliesin again again  matt so keyleth you have more movement still if you want to move somewhere  marisha oh ill scootch up a bit start moving towards  matt there  marisha thats good that works  matt okay that brings us to grog youre up  travis i would like to rush up where scanlan is and attack that little guy on the ground there  matt right there  sam im the little guy on the ground  travis no 
none	 not you the other guy thats next to him and can i use a reckless attack  matt are you raging first or are you  travis oh yeah raging i would like to rage and then use reckless attack against him  matt all right so you got two attacks reckless attack  travis 24  matt 24 hits  travis 23  matt 23 hits  travis awesome 18 on the first one  matt nice  travis and 23  matt 23 nice all right so as you rush past looking over at the cooled rock thats 
none	 starting to  crack and bits of steam vents are starting to push through underneath your feet scanlan the  area youre standing on isnt very sturdy youre probably going to want to move pretty soon  however you see this barreling form of pure anger and blade come rushing past as grog slams into the  salamander twice with his blade that fails first constitution and fails second so you gain plus  two strength salamander loses two strength  travis yes  matt however because youve taken with each strike within melee of the salamanders heated  body 
none	 its so intense by its proximity that you suffer six points of fire damage from the first  melee attack against you  travis she gave me resistance so halved to three  matt halved to two  travis halved to two  matt the other one would be 12 so you take six  travis eight total  matt total of eight fire damage just from slamming and attacking this salamander all  righty that brings us to the very end it is now the salamanders turn after being hacked twice by  you grog it turns around takes 
none	 its trident in both hands looks at you with this horrible snarl  you can see now these glistening almost rubylike sharp teeth in its wide grin snarl these long  catfishlike tendrils that waft off its face as it slams down the spear towards you  travis oh you brought a fork to a sword fight  matt that is going to be a 23 to hit  travis oh shit that hits  matt you take 12 points of piercing damage  travis halved  matt halved to six and its going to also turn around and its 
none	 tail its long snake tail whoosh  whips you that is going to be an 18 to hit  travis that misses  matt it misses all righty the tail comes towards you and you knock it out of the way with  craven edge that will end its turn top of the round im going to make a roll for the  consistency of the currently cooled lava pool it maintains however you feel your  feet cracking beneath  sam i think ill stay  travis feels nice here maybe a timeshare  matt this efreet let me 
none	 look at the logistics of this spell now because  travis its pissed off in a ball  taliesin oh yeah this spell is awful  sam it cant do anything  matt it is enclosed for the duration up to a minute  liam sorry matt sorry matt  travis hes like first the beholder now my flame genie  matt its pushing against and it takes these two flame balls it conjures and throws them out  towards you guys they just go impacts against the sphere and then go out and its just  growling its really

none	 a second he gets up in your face and grins snarls and the  actual breath that emanates from its teeth begins to burn and singe the edge of your beard hairs  that infuriates you and you lift up craven edge between the blades of the trident its a test of  strength as you both tense and eventually you lift it back and with the backswing slash him  right across his chest with that blow you see a strike of extremely hot hot blood splatter  across sizzling singe the front of your chest and leave little

none	 lava onto the broom and then blowing push youre not fully on it and its hard to  engage its mental commands directly with the current amount of chaos around you but you do  manage to skirt yourself to the very edge of the lava and land on your feet which are numb after  the sheer amount of pain youve suffered and you dont even want to look down at what you look  like from the waist below  laura do you need me to hold your broom while you cast your spell  chris please

none	 spin around and point your finger upward the arcane energy  forming at the end of your finger this singular beam of dull green arcane energy streaks forward  the efreet who is currently focused on scanlan and watching vex run past looks down just in time  to see you release the spell opens his eyes and attempts to dodge out of the way unfortunately  not fast enough it blasts in the side of its shoulder and you can see as a whole chunk of its  back muscle shoulder and lower torso are just turned to dust 
none	 exposing bone and elements of its  musculature and flesh underneath it goes snarls and looks down it cant even make a loud emission  of pain its just gutturally whispering its horrible suffering as it looks down it reaches  up with its hand and cauterizes the wound on the back of its body leaving it a charred cinder it  glares down at you extremely angry i hate you most of all scarecrow  chris go back to your fire slit  matt percy youre up unless you want your dudes to do anything by the way theyre

none	 a fourth 3rdlevel spell yeah  sam it was a 3rdlevel spell so its an extra 3rdlevel spell  matt right  sam im maxed out on 3rdlevel spells but i still have that thing  matt yeah so it wouldnt be a 4thlevel spell because you didnt cast into it as a 4thlevel  sam no i mean the fourth time ive cast a 3rdlevel spell  matt oh got you it wouldnt count against your daily its in addition to that  sam okay so i will for the first time ever use that stupid ioun stone and 
none	 cast lightning bolt  again im just sticking with my method here  matt all right all right with a five it does not make its saving throw go ahead and roll  damage 8d6  sam 8d6 thank you  liam here comes the cube  chris 23 28  sam thank you did you do this one too 28  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  travis both kills both of them  sam i think i would like to if theres a way id like to angle it somehow so that he 
none	 will drop  right on top of grog i feel like grog can do something to a falling behemoth  matt its hardpressed from this angle unfortunately grog is at an angle where you  wouldnt really be able to do that  sam damn it  matt mind you when you blast him hell plummet close to his feet if you wanted to  sam all right yes lets do that so grog can feel like he gets part of this too and if i can  id like to burn a big s in his chest  matt 
none	 so as you charge up and blast the lightning bolt from your crotch region you then do a little  dance maneuver with your waist causing it to crackling carve a scanlan s into the torso of  the efreet as it plummets to the ground slamming into where the lava would be while the fire  doesnt hurt its form you can see grog as it stands in the ground groaning its form is  turning into ash around you its actually just dissipating and turning to ash as its eyes roll up  and meet with yours  
none	 travis i run over in the lava and i go id like to cast beheading  matt all right you suffer 26 points of fire damage reduced to 13 from taking another  round in there  travis not a problem totally worth it for the spell  matt as you take craven edge and take the head off as the head rolls away  travis i grab it  matt you grab it it turns to ash  travis panting i run out of the lake  matt you get out of the lava stand on the side and 
none	 look over just as the rest of the head turns  to ashes  travis aw shit  laura i walk up to grog  liam you did it again  laura i pat him on the shoulder and say that was so impressive a genuine mage and i use  sleight of hand to shove the flying broom into the bag of holding  matt okay roll sleight of hand  taliesin whoa  liam yeah girl  chris am i allowed to roll a perception  matt yes you can  liam come on vex come on sister 
none	  laura 18  liam get it  chris 16  matt plus  taliesin no  matt total of 16  chris 15 plus one yeah  matt as youre dealing with this you have no notice of this you may question it later if you  like but you have no idea where it went and didnt see any of this transaction happen  laura oh no oh no  sam what what is it  laura your broom fell in the lava  chris what  laura i saw it  chris i just turned around for 
none	 a moment  laura i tried to give it back to you and it fell in the lava  chris are you sure  laura yeah  matt make a deception check  sam you shouldnt have looked at me when i cast my spell  chris this is why i never looked at you before  sam i was wrong to doubt you  chris no no youre a constant source of disappointment  laura 18  chris wheres my fucking broom  matt make an insight check now  chris insight 13  matt 13 shes telling the 
none	 truth man that broom just went straight in the lava  sam youre a horrible person  chris you know im really good at reading people and i know that youre telling me the  truth right now  laura im so sorry  chris no i feel your sorrow i feel it i feel bad for you that you have to experience that  its just a broom right its just a flying broom thats very difficult to find no big deal  laura i wouldnt know i dont even know  chris thats all right you know it 
none	 actually it sterilized me actually im quite glad it has  very dirty properties anyone that would put it between their legs to fly around would be in  horrible danger horrible danger so its actually probably for the better  sam communicable diseases  chris yeah so many stds its really just like a disease tampon is really what it is  liam a what is that like a magic candle  chris its sort of like a magic candle  laura a tragedy candle  chris its a tragedy candle  taliesin a blanston candle  chris yes 
none	  liam i dont understand sorcery at all  matt at this point you hear the flickering of flame and the portal itself has begun to expand  even further glowing brighter  marisha keyleth throws up a skywrite spell and says were taking the portal  matt okay as this is happening the flames themselves grow higher and higher the lava begins  to boil and roil as you guys all move up to the side you can see the lava is beginning to  bubbling splash out and spray bits are starting to scatter as some of the 
none	 nearby trees tumble  over you can see the four fire ashari as well as korren come across one of the clearings the other  way you see what looks to be another salamander gets thrown about 15 feet from the trees hits the  ground skids and is motionless as you see cerkonos with the rest of the pyrah the fire  ashari stepping through keyleth we saw your symbol is it time  marisha yes  matt all right let us try to close this rift and the rest of the druids all begin to gather  around 
none	 the outside of this portal as its flickering you can see piercing into the  extremely blinding light keyleth you take a moment and using your attachment to the fire  ashari and the fire elemental plane from your last passage through it you can see past the  brightness and see beyond the doorway you can see on the other side there appears to be probably  another half dozen or a dozen or so of a few other elementals and salamanders that are now making  their way towards the portal  marisha i stand next to my 
none	 father and join the rest of the druids  laura grog you should probably help them with all of your magic powers  travis do you think so it feels like its an intimate thing  laura just hold your hands up hold your hands up  travis all right  matt all right as the rest of the ashari begin to gather around the portal and concentrate they  are managing to hold the rift in its current size you see as beads of sweat begin to pour down  korrens face not used to this type of terrain 
none	 he goes gasps we need more power  travis okay  matt if you can aid whatever you have to bring to this please now is the time does anyone  wish to help with the ritual  laura oh yeah  chris ill help  matt all right how would you wish to help  sam what a nice guy he is certainly not someone we should swindle  liam strange that you would say that  chris i would know if someone were trying to swindle me believe me  sam thats true that is true  chris 
none	 you all have honest faces particularly her over there very honest face what can i do  to help  matt what do you think would lend itself to a fire gatesealing ritual it could be a spell it  could be a use of a skill how would you like to  sam a candle do you have any candles that could aid  laura like fiery candles maybe  chris i have a no this one casts this is bright light theres a thunder candle blink  candle destroy no that destroys dexterity i have a thunder candle 
none	 but i dont know if that  would work  matt make an arcana check  chris 19  matt 19 the blink candle which you crafted from various parts from blink dogs and other creatures  that have natural translocation capabilities might have the capability as this is a doorway  between planes and teleportation magic is based on creating shortform doorways between similar  spaces might have some impact on the ritual if used properly  chris i have this blink candle its formed from various animals that blink and if that has  transdimensional properties very good 
none	 properties the best kind of robust properties  that i can throw it in and it might help stop the from all of that  travis that makes perfect sense  chris right so were all in agreement then  sam wellexplained  chris all right so im going to hand blink candle to coral and im going to have coral walk  into the portal  travis brave coral  chris brave coral fuck ive lost two and my broom what a fucking terrible day  matt as coral takes the candle groans turns around and begins to just 
none	 slowly melt steps into  the lava  liam run coral run  matt nine points of fire damage to coral who was already sitting at  chris six  matt and had taken six damage right so 15 from 33 corals at half health coral as this is  rough terrain gets part of the way there then continues walking forward the rest of the  way takes an additional 17 points of damage  laura oh no  matt so thats 32 points of damage whats corals hitpoints 33 is the max  laura thats what you said 
none	  matt yep on the sheet right there i can read my own text 33 hit points coral at one hitpoint gets  up to the lava take the candle and boof as the energy expands from it you can see a ripple  a heat wave ripple that billows outward coral vanishes entirely and the portal shrinks down by  about five to six feet actually closing in its space  chris oh coral i forgot to tell you somethi fuck  matt suddenly you hear a zip and coral appears about ten 15 feet in the air  
none	 chris oh good there you are listen did you see my broom  matt smack coral falls those 15 feet taking six points of bludgeoning damage lets see if coral  survives this with undead fortitude nope that is a roll of eight versus a total dc of 11 with the  damage taken and coral just splats like a really really old orange just slammed into the concrete  just splatting  travis like an old orange  matt one of the fire ashari goes cringing gagging and just ends up concentrating on holding  the gate  chris 
none	 im starting to think youre all very bad luck  matt however that did aid the ritual we have two more folks who could aid in this ritual  laura i can use i dont know if it will help but i have a really great diamond of awesomeness  thats precious  matt how would that help the ritual  laura i dont know  marisha am i a part of the people who could be included in the ritual too  matt yeah oh yeah  marisha okay i am going to cast a 7thlevel plane shift to 
none	 help smush it closed  matt all right go ahead and make a nature roll with advantage this is your understanding of  the natural elements of the world around you and the connection you have with the fire elemental plane  laura i dont know how this magic stuff works  travis oh ill teach you later  marisha 12 oh with advantage 23  matt 23 as you begin to concentrate your hands instinctively burst into flames to coalesce your  connection to the fire elemental plane as you complete the plane shift spell your form shimmers  
none	 for a second and for a moment it looks like shes only partially there shes actually translucent  as flames begin to lick up the sides of her body at this point you can see the lava flow in the  mountain begins to slow and the bubbling begins to come to a stillness the portal itself shimmers  again and then shrinks down to the size of a normal doorway about five foot by ten foot tall  and its just barely holding on as youre concentrating on holding it in its place you can  see now the 
none	 rest of the druids around are sweating profusely who wishes to take on the last part of  this ritual  travis i have a firebrand warhammer i could hit it anybody else got anything better  laura do you have any magic stuff scanlan  sam i can inspire them i mean  travis your dimension door  marisha do you have your dimension door  sam dimension door what  marisha a door i did planar binding which technically really wasnt supposed to do what i  just did  matt planar shift you said  marisha planar 
none	 shift i mean yes 7thlevel  matt finding ways to tailor magic essences into this type of a ritual  sam do i know that that will work or help  matt you dont know youll find out however you wish to aid this ritual and justify how it would  be helpful in this instance  liam theres something i could do  travis yeah spit it up  liam i whip the cape of the mountebank out of my pocket and run at that door and jump off the edge  and just try to balloon umbrella it 
none	 down over with that red cape  matt hmm okay  laura matador it  liam im doing it im matadoring it  matt okay i will say hmm how do i make this work im going to want you to go ahead and make  an acrobatics check  liam okay that is a 25  matt all right you rush up leaping off the side spinning in the air as you do you unfurl  the cape and turn it into a limited parachutetype projection and as you slam it down towards i  need you to go 
none	 ahead and make a wisdom check to see if you have the capability of triggering the  magic of the item at the right time to be impactful  liam cross your fingers everybody  travis come on vax  liam no bonuses here  chris no whammys  marisha we dont still have our fancy feast do we  sam oh yeah are we still feasting  matt yeah  liam so what does that mean advantage  marisha you have advantage on wisdom throws  liam thats better that is 13  matt 13 thats better as you 
none	 come down you take the cape and encase you trigger the magic  at which point the remainder of this doorway just blinks out entirely the cape gone the doorway gone  liam hot hot hot hot hot  matt as vax splashing right into the lava  marisha i take a grasping vine from the edge and try and yank him back  matt okay you take 22 points of fire damage as you splat into the lava  liam the deathwalkers ward is set to fire  matt so it resisted to 11 so you splashing in the 
none	 lava all of a sudden images  flash in your head of the time that you lost most of your foot in the underdark and you go  liam no no no no no no no no  matt and before you can even react all of a sudden something wraps around your waist and  yanks you out as a vine pulls you in an arc and slams you into the hard obsidian floor on the  outside of the lava flow the rest of you gather there as the rest of the druids finish their  concentration the 
none	 lava pools themselves have gone still and you can see elements beginning to cool  and theres currently no sign of a tear between the elemental planes thats  currently bursting through  travis nice job vax  liam where am i am i near her on the ground  matt she would be back here youre on the ground right next to a dancing skeleton  marisha i moved up i moved up i would be over there  matt you would be part of the ritual but you fell next to the dancing skeleton  liam okay i 
none	 look at the skeleton i look at her i look at the skeleton i look at her  im an idiot  marisha yeah no i already knew that its fine you did good you did good i reach down and i  help him on his feet how bad are you  liam im pretty bad  marisha i cure wounds level four  travis yeah cool do that im going to walk out of the lava now  laughter  matt taking another 21 points of fire damage reduced to ten the druids look around and give a 
dung	  nod of acceptance all of them acknowledge you who they have not met and dont understand quite  where you came from or why youre here one of them who is currently missing an arm on one hand  dark weathered skin long jet black hair cruising down to the middle of his back approaches you and  his one right arm he puts on the shoulder and says into your eyes i do not know you friend  but you have come to our aid at an hour when we really required it  chris great sure i 
none	 just thought id come and lose a couple of thralls and my fucking broom but  great to be here everyone seems nice especially her shes great  matt he removes his hand very well  chris let me know if i can do anything else do you want a candle  matt candle  chris well i make candles just various candles  matt he does this and his finger bursts into flame and you can see a flame flickering we do  not need candles here in pyrah but thank you  liam is that the finger or 
none	 is that the finger  matt insinuated actual finger at this point korren your father approaches you and places a  hand on your shoulder and turns you around to look you in the face and you can see theres  smears of dirt and still glistening from sweat from the whole ritual and looks a bit weathered  and winded from the experience keyleth im proud of you  marisha thank you father  matt i think we will stay here and help the pyrah try and rebuild  marisha oh okay  matt and he takes your chin 
town	 and pulls it up and looks you in the face with a broad smile on his  face he says the road before you keyleth is hard and fraught with loss and sadness to live is  to struggle against the void but its those moments of darkness that define the joy of the  world around them learn from the loss and push forward as a beacon of perseverance of hope for  life after pain this is one of the pillars of strength of a leader one that i have learned with the  loss of your mother 
none	 but you are my beacon of hope and to many more than you even expect and  he looks back towards the four other members of the zephrah tribe that are all just looking at you  and they nod  marisha i hope i do not fail you father  matt i trust you will not go forth while we stay here i want you to grasp your destiny  vanquish this terrible beast that lies on the shores of taldorei complete your aramente  marisha how do you know that this is my destiny  matt whatever your 
none	 destiny is grasp it but youve chosen this path and all destiny really  is is the choices you make leading towards a goal that perhaps you do not yet understand but  when youve returned i wish for you to teach us the wisdom youve gained on this journey  marisha kaitiaki father  matt kaitiaki keyleth  chris did you see a broom lying around anywhere  matt no  chris sorry  matt its all right we will keep an eye out for it though  chris please and tell everyone feelthegern theyll know what it means 
none	  sam what is a hashtag  chris ill explain later  sam all right  matt well unless theres anything else we have business to attend to in restoring this area i  wish you all great luck   marisha korren if we should ever need you if i should ever need you or the assistance of the  ashari what is the best way to get hold of you  matt call to zephrah come home and we will come with you as he looks over all of you  giving each a look of a nod 
none	 of respect and appreciation  dont you by simple minds plays  liam wow  taliesin i felt it coming  matt glances past to grog vex and lingers a very long look on vax and just gives you a nod  laura his diamond earring is glistening in the light  matt yeah  liam did i stutter  matt stay safe for her sake and korren turns around and walks back as the rest of the zephrah  ashari walk along with him you through all this chaos get a little bored and frustrated with all  this 
none	 weird nonsensical stuff look at the ground and realize theres a lot of hidden treasures  scattered amongst this vicinity  chris probably so you know i might stay behind a bit and dig around for a little while you know  candlemakings a difficult business  sam is it now  chris aye  taliesin well if youre ever looking for more customers youll always find them in whitestone  so if you make your way north  chris excellent  taliesin youre always welcome  chris thank you could someone heal me a bit before you leave im

none	 outskirts of where the lava pool is you can see what look to be broken slivers  of sootcovered dragon scale just peppered throughout the landscape barely visible until you  look real close thanks to the constant barrage of blacken soot and dust that falls from the nearby area  laura do you collect dragon scales for your candles  chris oh i forgot to tell you i sold out my own kind because i was enslaved by dragons who had  tails who consider themselves royalty and therefore better than me and i dont have a tail  
none	 and so i spent my whole life trying to figure out how to turn scales into weaponized candles anyway got  to go everyone have a great time thank you  matt you just leave  chris i leave scoop up some of the few scales and piss off  matt you guys watch as gern blanston begins walking around and like a gutter snipe or one of  the people on the beach with a metal detector starts combing through  chris singing dont you forget about me  laura gern before you leave  chris aye  laura
