look at all that  matt nothing were going to jump right into it all right guys so welcome to tonights episode  of critical role so to get you up to speed real fast the group vox machina after finishing their  foray in whitestone finding a member of /none/ the council riskel daxio was a cult member for this  entity called vecna bringing him to justice and executing him in the throne room of the palace of  emon they discovered during the search the traveling troupe of dr dranzels performance  troupe which scanlan used to be a part of during this time they hatched a plan to have vox machina  seek this house that had fallen into disarray and the owner disappeared for a while that may  contain some goods the party went and investigated they had previously been in the  house and /none/ were curious as to where it stands at this point in time especially if more people are  disappearing into it upon going into what was once general kriegs house where they once fought  a blue dragon they discovered the corpse of krieg longburied from the collapse of the cavern  and picked apart by some other large clawed creature and immediately got into some sort of  a fight with a purple worm and a frost worm that were essentially battling over whatever it was that was  moving in that tunnel that seemed to be nice and /tavern/ tasty these adolescent worm creatures not even  fully grown proved a nice little challenge but the party managed to succeed in escaping after  killing them before the mother showed up they returned to emon managed to help scanlans  nowdiscovered daughter kaylie out of a little pinch in getting imprisoned after shed gotten  into a major bar brawl and the party returned to their keep where they were notified that uriel  the sovereign of taldorei and the city state of emon had an announcement to make in the cloudtop  district so gathered gilmore gathered the /none/ rest of the party and everyone went to the cloudtop  district around noon at the presentational stage not at noon at dusk sorry the other one so at  which point uriel announced that he felt he was no longer a worthy leader or ruler of this entire  realm he has under his watch and is deciding to step down during this announcement however a number  of strange entities came through the clouds in the sky as a series of chromatic ancient dragons  swooped in and began to destroy the city of emon many of the /none/ townsfolk gathered at that square were  immediately killed the party as well as a few straggling survivors ran away as both the large  gargantuan black and green dragon begin to chase you down right before they honed in to pick you  off an even larger ancient red dragon shoved them off to head east to continue their plot after  slamming down into the center of emon and claiming it as his own domain the party escaped via the  druids transport via plants spell and just stepped through the tree to land in the center of /none/  their keep of greyskull so now we pick up where that left off  so as you all come rushing through the other side of the transport spell each one of you comes  stumbling out into the center of the temple to sarenrae thats constructed on the base floor of  your keep the sheer intensity and force that pushes you all through one after another some of  you end up tripping and catching yourself but nevertheless you all make it through safe and  sound before the large tree trunk behind you the portal snaps shut /none/ the magic exhausted the  adrenaline still pumping in your head youre all still thinking over and processing what exactly  had just happened and what it means  travis are we all here  marisha all those people  taliesin yes yes  travis is anyone hurt  taliesin thats a good question  marisha can we see anything from here  matt looking around right now you have the stained glass of the complex the keep seems to be  in order from this perspective you dont see anything because the city is on the opposite side  /none/ of the keep this portion of the temple is actually facing southward  taliesin i suppose id like to get a vantage point to see what we can see is there any way  to i think we all took damage i think were all hurt  travis were all hurt a little bit  liam pike heal  ashley yeah let me do some healing  matt pike be aware as part  ashley i dont know where im at  matt yeah ill let you know where you are at you cast lets see you cast heal once /none/ which i  believe was your 6thlevel spell and then you cast mass cure wounds so a 5thlevel spell so  youve cast a 6th and a 5th  ashley one 6th and one 5th  matt correct  ashley okay all right and then healthwise where am i at went down 66  matt healthwise you were down 66 and then you healed up i dont remember the exact number it  was like 24 well go with 24 its fine  ashley okay guys lets do a mass cure wounds then at fourth level  matt okay which /none/ one is this are you casting cure wounds  ashley yeah  matt on who  ashley a mass cure wounds sorry  matt mass cure wounds is a 5thlevel spell  ashley how low is everybody  travis im all right  liam im all right  laura 43 but if we can take a short rest we can roll some dice  marisha im at 32 so same thing  taliesin 57  travis short rest  ashley short rest  marisha we should get inside anyways  taliesin lets get inside i want to see if i /none/ can get a vantage from the top  liam i think in the short term we need to take care of two things one get a vantage point and  see how the keep is and what we can see from above we also need to get the staff out of here  we need to send them away immediately  taliesin do we send them away or do we send them down below like for shelter  laura we dont need them running out  taliesin its safer than running around outside thats where i want to end up /none/  laura send them below  liam out of the city though into the wild  laura if we need to we can bring them through the portal into whitestone  marisha we dont know what all is safe right now  liam im all right so im going to go find the staff and herd them down below and tell them what  has happened  taliesin you can put them in my workshop actually  marisha why dont we all head down there  taliesin yes lets head down to my workshop because i have to unlock it /none/ anyway  matt pike are you not casting cure mass wounds you have one more 5thlevel spell so you could do  if you wanted  ashley yeah let me go ahead and do it  matt okay so i believe thats 3d8 plus five unless im mistaken  liam this ones on everyone  matt this was on this would be on up to six creatures so 3d85 well everybody but one  laura everybody but scanlan  matt sure everybody but scanlan well put it there  ashley 18  matt plus five  ashley thats plus five /none/  matt okay so everyone heals 18 hit points  ashley rolled a little low  matt thats all right okay youre heading off  liam im going to start moving through the entire place im going to start at the front gate and  see if anybodys outside  matt as you head into the foyer the first thing you see is laina currently panicking about  running around with erwin falling behind trying to calm her down and going laina its all right  calm down and laina is like i dont know what to do i i /none/ she turns around and sees you oh  master master vax  liam its actually not all right we need to gather everyone right now quickly ill explain  after weve gotten everyone in the keep we need to go to percivals workshop can you help me with  that  matt we can do that we have a problem she points out the front of the keep is currently  opened the doors and the gates there and you can hear what sounds like a cluster of very loud  voices shouting and screaming and yelling over each other /none/  travis outside of the keep  liam but im on my own right  matt you are yeah  marisha what are the voices speaking  matt are you following him to the foyer currently only vax is  liam go to percivals workshop go i will handle it  marisha i figured wed all be moving outside at least  matt all right as you guys move into the foyer to follow you see vax having this conversation  with laina she and erwin go head back down to head down to the workshop what are you doing /none/  liam im going to go stealth toward the door to see what the hell is going on out there  matt okay roll stealth check  liam yeah its a 29  matt all right good to know all right so as you go to the door and look out you can see  along the top wall there are three figures takes you a moment to focus and you realize that it is  kendrick whos one of your general guards you keep around as well as cordell and shayne all  three of them have crossbows ready /none/ and theyre yelling to each other and aiming them over the  wall towards the front however what you can hear from this point is a chorus of 20 30 or more  voices muffled from the other side of the wall  liam im going to start running up towards them im going to join them on the wall  matt okay so there is a ladder at the side and you climb up the ladder and as you get closer  you hear people shouting different voices going let us in let us in or well die voices /none/ going  what are you doing you going to leave us out here other people are screaming you hear  crying children you hear people shrieking  liam how many people am i seeing down there  matt well as you get up to the top and crest over you can see the three guards are all yelling  at each other and yelling over we cant we cant do anything right now were waiting for  th they look over and see you come over the edge and you can see theres probably close  to 50 or so /town/ people that are all pressed up against the gates to the inside of your keep that are all  shouting to be let in  liam if i look past do i see anyone else coming towards the keep is it just a cluster and thats  it or  matt you can see people that are fleeing from the town in little bits two or three at a time  trails of individuals that are just now managing to make it outside of the city of emon itself  some of them are heading out into the distance getting /town/ far away as possible a few more are  heading towards the keep and you gather that this crowd has been gathering here for the last few  minutes at the very least  liam all right slapping my hand on kendricks shoulder we are going to let these people in the  city has come under attack everything is fucked beyond belief there are at least four large old  dragons attacking the city and these people need to come inside i dont know what were going to  do with them but were going to bring them in /none/ now and you and i are going to wait by the gate  for those stragglers to come in the rest of you take them inside join the others  matt they all look at each other cordell gives you a nod right sir well open the gate hold  on and you guys all are you heading out to the courtyard as well or are you staying inside the  keep  laura yeah yeah we see them  matt so you come out and see this happening and hear them shouting at the top of the wall  /none/ marisha keyleth stands in the middle of the foyer unable to move  taliesin keep them out of my workshop but put them into the spare rooms and anywhere we have  room  laura maybe the cathedral  taliesin the cathedral is a great idea  matt at this point you hear this strange highpitched whine sound vax as you look up you  can see there are these columns of smoke that are billowing out of the city in the distance as mass  areas are burning and smoldering you see coming out of one of the clouds /none/ something spinning slowly  towards you and you look up and see its one of the skyships from the cloudtop district one half  of it currently in flames  laura inside now  liam i scream out get the gates open now  matt at which point you can see now shayne and cordell are pulling on the ratchets pulling the  chains up as fast as they can while putting their eyes up and seeing this as it careens in your  direction  taliesin im running up to the tower as quickly as i can  liam /none/ and im firemans pole down the ladder down one side of the ladder to get to the gate  matt okay the gate opens a little bit enough to get one or two people through and begins to push  through and you can see now people are yelling in pain as theyre being crushed as the whole mass  of them are pushing through the small opening  liam i scream out if you rush you will die  matt it doesnt seem to be affecting anybody unfortunately theres this inlaid fear this  animalistic need to survive  /none/ laura i start to grab people arms and pulling them through and helping people get through  safely  matt at this point the skyship has passed overhead missing the top of the keep and the  highest walls by about 40 or so feet for a few seconds of silence and you hear impact  shaking the ground for a few seconds not far from here you can see another blast of red fire and a  couple of sparks of arcane energy that arc out as another column of smoke south of you begins to  pour up /none/ into the sky  marisha feeling that i snap out of it and run to the south exit of the castle to look for the  explosion  matt okay as you start rushing in that direction to the south side of the castle  looking back to where the skyship came through you can see the smoke parts once more and you see  unfurling from within two large white wings bearing down and you can see as it swoops down  there are groups of people that are rushing 100 200 300 feet away that are pulling themselves /none/  out of the ravine that sits between the south walls of emon and the north walls of your keep as  theyre pouring through the mud and the stream there its about four or five feet deep it swoops down  and unleashes a blast of freezing cold energy that freezes that whole section of the river solid and  every person in that vicinity as well locked in place  marisha does keyleth see all of this  matt you dont see this because youre  inside the wall you see it come down and swoop  by /none/ you see it circle around you however have a good view of this right as youre about to go  down the wall on the ladder  taliesin vex i need you on the roof  laura all right i run up  matt as you go running up you guys see now it circles back around and its wings tilt to one side  as it begins to make its way towards the keep for a second sweep i would like everyone to roll  initiative  travis yeah we got to get down  marisha natural 20  /none/ travis you want to go first  matt put you there percy and vex you guys are up on the wall technically right  taliesin up here so we can get down real quick  matt okay yeah so the ladder is there  taliesin well shouldnt there be a door that leads to that anyway  matt the way this is designed is its a ladder getting up and down  taliesin okay thatll do  matt did you still go down the ladder or are you staying up top here  liam no i already said i went /none/ down  matt okay so as soon as you see it swoop overhead you come back down to the bottom there  scanlan is currently inside for the sake of this and may come out here in a moment hes figuring  out whats going on grog where are you  travis i guess i was out in the courtyard trying to help the cattle come in  matt all right so lets go ahead and place some cattle  laura jesus  travis the door to get back inside is located where  laura yeah wheres the cathedral at /none/ is that what the other entry is  matt this is the entrance to your actual keep there essentially these two sections here are  the doors that lead through to the interior people are pouring through at this point trying  to get through as fast as possible whole cluster of them  taliesin got to get that thing finished  laura theres more on the outside there is that what youre putting there  matt pike you are where  ashley yeah somewhere around there  matt in the center keeping watch there all right and trinket is /none/ with you or trinket cant  make it up the ladder so trinket is staying in the courtyard probably keeping close to pike  right there all righty so initiative 25 to 20  liam 24  marisha 22  taliesin 27 26 26  matt what did you get keyleth  marisha 22  matt all right who got 20 to 15  laura 15  matt 15 pike what did you get  ashley three  matt three grog  travis nine  ashley i can do some cleanup  laughter  travis three  ashley matt real /none/ quick  travis he said yeah you can go ahead  ashley oh i think i do have a sixth level because i think that sixth level was used for liam with the  worm and then we came back to the keep to rest  matt thats right thats correct you do have a sixth level spell still yes thank you for the  reminder good on you all right and so here we have cordell we have shayne and we have kendrick  right there on the top as well top currently the dragon is about id say /none/ 120 feet off this  direction youre up first percy  taliesin does it seem like the dragon has noticed us  matt the dragon at the moment is currently seeing the keep it doesnt notice anyone in particular  it just sees a swarm of people trying to get inside and its circling around to try and do  another dive attack  taliesin how dumb am i  matt thats up to you buddy  taliesin okay cool  laura dont be real dumb because im standing next to you  taliesin all right im going to pull /none/ out bad news and im going to make a targeted shot at its  wings and try to put a hole into its wings  matt okay go for it go ahead and take the shot  travis what the fuck  come on golden snitch  taliesin natural 20  cheering  travis get the hell out of here  taliesin im back baby  matt go ahead and roll some damage on that  liam a little tiny ray of sunshine  matt 4d12 for the hit on that and then whats the save to see if it /none/ can maintain height  taliesin its a constitution saving throw  matt all right laughs it rolled a four  taliesin yeah  matt it is plus 14 to its constitution saving throw so its 18 whats the dc on that  taliesin eight plus my proficiency mod plus my dexterity mod so i dont know six seven  eight nine ten 18  matt so it just makes the save  taliesin hold on is that right its proficiency bonus  matt proficiency bonus plus four  taliesin plus dexterity which is six  matt six which is 18 /none/ and it just makes the save  taliesin stupid dragon  matt just makes its save but still does damage go ahead and roll that  travis at least you hit it you got to bleed it a bit longshot  taliesin 27 points of damage lets see one more yeah one more shot at the wings just to see  if i can take it down make it  matt okay the second attack is reload third attack another grit point to try and take it  down go for it roll for the attack  taliesin 25  /none/ matt 25 hits it rolled a three that is 17  taliesin laughs drop fucker  matt terrible terrible all right so that will effectively reduce its speed or its height by  what  taliesin height by 20 feet and i imagine that would throw it a bit  matt it might  liam now its angry  taliesin and lets do some damage and damage is 20 points of damage  matt 20 nice all right 27 points of damage on the round  taliesin im going to hold my movement until its so close that i want /none/ im going to hold my  movement until  matt you can hold an action you cant really hold movement  taliesin okay then im going to use my bonus action to turn to vex and fight or flight all  right you can answer next turn yeah  matt however as the first bullet hits you see it takes the hit in the wing but it hits the  muscle on the edge as it goes into its glide to head down you fire into the other wing this time  blowing a hole through the leather flap and /none/ you can see it lose about 20 feet and is actually now skidding  towards the roof of the keep  laura oh jeez  taliesin that was a good plan  matt okay that ends your turn vax youre up  liam im going to dive by that tree  matt right here  liam yeah im going to use my bonus action to hide  matt all right  liam and im going to hold my attack until it is on the ground or low to the ground  matt all right got it so youre holding your /none/ attack if you can all right cool keyleth  marisha where am i in regards to everyone else  matt you are right here because you were heading to the south wall when all this went down  marisha oh okay  matt this is the north direction this way it came this way swooped past circled around and  now its coming back from this direction  marisha okay i want to use my movement to get under that tree  matt under this tree or that tree  marisha yeah let me no towards the entrance heading for /none/ cover  travis yeah  matt here  marisha yeah  matt okay so youre behind the tree  marisha and now im going to cast fog cloud at fourth level which makes it a radius of 80 feet  matt 80foot radius  marisha if you cast it at higher levels it goes up by 20 feet for each level higher you cast it  so im casting it at fourth level okay so i go all storm for a second get all mistyeyed and i want  to create a nice lowlevel fog across the whole castle  /none/ matt okay okay so heavily obscured heavily obscured will give everyone a 34 cover bonus  let me see what heavily obscured would actually do specifically to be sure real fast pardon me  travis i dont even know what 34 cover bonus is  matt its when youre blocked by something it gives you a bonus to  travis never happens to me im usually a 34 cover bonus  matt all right it blocks vision entirely creatures suffer from the blinded condition so  everyone in the entire keep is now blinded  marisha well i want to /none/ make it like a fog cloud over top so were blinded by  matt so its above you guys is what youre saying  marisha yeah so were blocked from the dragon as we flee i hope you guys werent wanting to shoot  at it by the way  taliesin well were above it the cloud would be between  matt the cloud now is encompasses this whole area here which means the only people that are  affected by it are the people at the top of this tower right now got it was that your turn your /none/  movement  marisha thats it  matt cool stay there  marisha well i moved  matt right you moved there are you done with your turn okay so now it is the white dragons  turn the white dragon as it comes down you dont see it anymore because the fog cloud  obscures it but you suddenly hear the sound of a heavy object slamming into stone and the cracking  and breaking of stone against the surface as the dragon has now due to the fall of height slammed  into the top of the keep /none/ and is tearing its underside against the roof who knows the state  that the roof of the keep is going to be in right now but because of that im going to ahead and  laura well just have riskel fix it oh wait  matt well he was the overseer he actually had somebody else build the actual thing by hand  laura oh okay well good  matt so it suffers 14 points of damage  laura thats it  matt yeah its dragonhide man  travis what about all the spires that are up there that /none/ have antidragon poison  matt yeah that was a dream unfortunately however it does somewhat emerge you can see its  form somewhat as it comes down in this direction ending its movement here  travis oh no  marisha wait it skids to a halt right there  matt its just the fog cloud as it slams into the keep and tumbles off the top of it and catches  itself in the air wingbeats  travis how high above us is it  matt it is currently 20 feet above you guys for its turn it is going /none/ to pick a random direction  to try and blast its cold breath at so let me go ahead and roll the direction on this  laura because its all covered in fog  matt yeah it cant see right now currently its obscured oh hold on but it has  blindsight 60 feet so it has no effect on him unfortunately so as it stops in the air it still  manages to use its sense of smell and the general atmospheric ability to sense whats around it it  seem to move its head and search  liam /none/ can i attack right now i was holding my attack  matt you can now whats the range on your daggers  liam 60 because im sharpshooter  matt 30 40 50 60 its just at the cusp like just barely cusp but yeah you can get your  attack  liam so im going before him and its a surprise attack because im hidden and im going first  matt yes youre essentially interrupting his attack because the moment he came into range  liam so its an advantage and it is an automatic crit  matt its not /none/ a automatic crit its not surprised  liam its not surprised  matt no it know you guys are there  liam even hiding behind a tree all right  matt a surprise generally means that it has absolutely no idea that you are there or theres  any sort of threat from you  liam 24  matt 24 hits  liam all right and then the second dagger i throw i can only throw a second one is also a  24  matt both hit  liam so the first one is double dice so eight plus /none/ 14 15 18 23 25 double dice is 50 plus  seven is yeah 57 for the first  matt ooh nice  liam and the second one goes bink that is a ten  matt ten all right 57 points of damage thats is that straightup dice rolls thats  crazy  liam thats sneak attack ive gone up a level to 13  matt right so its a d6 or 7d6  liam 7d6 oh wait  matt its not doubled though  liam sorry sorry sorry 25 plus seven is 32 sorry 32  matt 32 there /none/ you go i was like thats really high for a noncrit  liam the second one was ten 32 ten  matt so 42 points of damage still not shabby by any means gotcha as you chuck both daggers in  the direction where you can see as its now at the very bottom of the fog cloud you have enough  visual to strike towards it without missing and both daggers sink into the bottom of the creature  one of them you know was a nice impactful wounding for any other creature but it doesnt  seem to /none/ have taken much issue with the impact of the blade appear at your side again that ends  your reaction now vorugal is going to go looking at the area of most density  liam what was his name again  matt ah you will know that shortly the white dragon the white dragon rears up in the fog cloud  and dips down a little bit exhales outside of the fog cloud hitting everyone in this vicinity  here thats going to be grog trinket and everyone here over i would like all of you to  make a /none/ constitution saving throw well im not going to roll that many dice im going to use my  dice roller  ashley come on guys  marisha im not going to roll that many dice always a good sign  liam grogs about to lose ten percent of his hit points  matt i dont have enough d6s its 16d6 or sorry 16d8 my apologies all right so that  comes to grog whats your  travis 25  matt 25 thats a success whats trinkets  laura 15  matt 15 all right that is 63 points of cold /none/ damage to trinket  laura trinket is unconscious  matt all right trinket actually freezes in place now you can see the armor itself has about  an inchthick layer of ice as currently the eyes go dull as unconsciousness takes the bear but  unable to show or reveal that grog you take half that so you are at you take 32 points of cold  damage let me roll some saves here average saves okay so these four here survive the rest  of these are all entirely wiped out and you can see now the people that /none/ were rushing in are now  rushing away from the keep the rest are getting the fuck out of dodge so yeah thats going to be  the end of the white dragons turn that brings us to vex youre up in the fog cloud right now so  you have no visual range on the creature you hear all these screams and hear the blast  laura i cant see it  matt no unfortunately the fog cloud is just high enough where it covers this area for you  guys however you could jump off if you wanted /none/ to make an acrobatics roll and then maybe do your  attack afterwards if you wanted to try that your call  laura wouldnt i still be in the fog cloud if i was on the ground  matt no the fog cloud is elevated up here it starts here and then goes upward keyleth created  it in the air you guys are at the base of it right now  laura so i can use my movement to jump down  matt yes if you want to  laura all right im going to fucking hunters mark him /none/  matt you cant see him right now unfortunately  laura im going to jump fucking down on the ground  matt so you jump go ahead and make an acrobatics check as you leap off the highest part of the  wall of your keep all of a sudden the fog dissipates and you see the ground rushing up  towards you  laura 14  matt 14 you manage to catch yourself you arent knocked prone but you do suffer five points of  damage from the fall but you catch yourself grunts get up and now you /none/ can see at the very  very base of the fog cloud the head peeking though and the wings occasionally wingbeats from  out underneath and you have visual on the dragon  laura okay im going to hunters mark him and im going to shoot him through the sky sentinel  matt you already used the sky sentinel if i recall against the green dragon didnt you  laura on the worm  matt was it the worm okay  laura and i multiclassed today so im a rogue so i get sneak attack on this  matt it /none/ currently does not have  laura does it know that does it see me  matt you havent tried to stealth so technically yes as soon as you jumped off and land and hurt  yourself and your ankle you look up and it sees you  laura never fucking mind balls all kind of balls around here right now the first attack is  25  matt 25 hits  laura the second attack is 24  matt both hit  laura the third attack is 16  matt 16 misses  laura okay so let me doublecheck an /none/ extra d6 for those two 15 plus seven is what  liam 15 plus seven is 22  laura 22 on the first arrow 15 plus four is 19 on the second arrow im a little upset right now  and then im going to shoot the third arrow through the blazing bowstring i mean my second  attack  matt okay  laura and that doesnt hit him so good times  matt so as you land you get up pull out your arrow and as you pull back and release it you  can see it bursts into /none/ arcane energy and splits into three different arrows two slamming into the  fog cloud and hitting the sides of the dragon and its knocked around for a second it looks around  and its eyes peer at you you did the additional hunters mark damage on it right  laura i did  matt cool you see now its looking around choosing what its next round is going to be about  and you seem like a tasty morsel though not entirely drawn to its attention at the moment you  still have a little bit of movement if /none/ you wanted to move  laura can i no  taliesin just for clarification which door is back into the keep that one okay  laura is it possible to get inside the door  matt inside of  laura the door that im right there if i backed up into the door  matt yeah id say you could well say youre inside right now you hide inside the best you can  to keep out of view  laura yeah i want to be ducked around a wall if i can on the inside of the door  /none/ matt okay that ends your turn  laura yes  matt all right so at that point now your guards over here dont have they cant see at  all but they saw you jump off the side kendrick is going to go ahead and take the ladder down and  its going to be his movement to land there theyre both going to jump and make your using  your example cordell not bad and shayne actually both rolled pretty well both managed to  prevent any fall damage catching themselves on the ground with their heavy crossbows ready /none/ they  rush up and fire both at the dragon five and a one god damn that hits and a 19 all right so  cordell and shayne both manage to get one shot that hits the dragon on both sides so both bolts  hit so thats seven damage and ten damage so 17 damage total from them as they fire the heavy  crossbow try and reload it and get off a second shot that ends their turn now that brings us to  grogs turn  travis i would like to rage  matt okay  travis /none/ and run at trinket  matt okay  travis hes covered in how much ice  matt about an inch inch and a half of ice and the rest of the entities all the rest of the  people that died they all got frozen in place and some of them shattered in the impact and theres  chunks of them frozen on the ground  liam is that a medicine check at this point if trinket is frozen in ice you cant say  matt you have no idea  liam thanks could i pee on him and thaw /none/ him out quickly  matt over time yeah youll have to drink a lot beforehand and wait a little while jog in place  what you got grog  travis i would like to run to the side that is closest to you on trinket i would like to start  pushing him along the lawn towards the entrance to the keep like a giant ice block  matt okay so this side there go ahead and make a strength check  travis okay  matt because you are raging you have advantage on strength checks  travis yes thank /none/ god 18  matt 18 okay you did suffer damage this turn but you started raging this turn so if you  dont suffer damage until the beginning of next turn your rage ends and youll have to rage  again just a heads up but with that roll though you managed to push him well say 15 feet  that direction grunts pushing a giant frozen bear and hes sliding against the grass in the front  of the courtyard sweats beginning to pop on your brow as your teeth are gritted and looking over  your shoulder you /none/ can still hear the snapping and the the air itself of the entire courtyard has  dropped about 20 degrees and you can begin to see your breath in the vicinity of this creature that  ends your turn grog  travis yeah  matt scanlan now steps out from the inside of the keep because sam is texting me what he wants to  do he rushes out at this point seeing all of this from the inside he whips out his wand of  fireballs and aims it up at the bottom of the dragon that is now /none/ visible underneath as you see now  the edge of the wand flickers red for a second before a little bead of light streaks forward and  explosion detonates beneath it the dragon would fail its saving throw but its going to use its  legendary resistance once to autosave so it takes half damage he is going to use what did  he tell me how many slots he wanted to do okay so hes going to use three of its charges to do  this one that will put it at  laura what is he doing  /none/ liam hes trying to resist scanlan sent a fireball at it and its fucking with it  matt 36 damage halved from him so that still puts it at 17 points of fire damage to it not too  shabby as it blasts out from the opposite side of it through the bottom of the cloud keeping  everyone else outside of the collateral damage radius of the fireball because of its height so  thats good scanlan then realizing the circumstances uses the rest of his movement to  get back into the very corner of the keep and /none/ defend himself against the wall thats going to  end scanlans turn pike youre up  ashley all right im can i run over to where trinket is okay im going to cure wounds on him  matt okay so you move over to trinket all right go ahead and cast cure wounds  ashley okay im going to cast it at 4thlevel  matt 4thlevel okay 4d8 plus five  travis on the floor  ashley dang 30  matt 30 trinket heals up as pike reaches out grasping her symbol in one hand a look of  desperation /none/ in her face her hand goes out and touches the ice and as her hand touches her  fingers melt through through the ice with divine energy in her fingertips and manages to touch  trinkets fur beneath as the divine energy filters through her body trinkets form glows  from the inside and the ice begins to crack before it all shatters off of trinkets body and trinket  catches himself bear grunts and shakes off what little bit of remaining ice and moisture is on the coat  laura thank you guys  ashley i want to scratch /none/ behind his ears  matt okay trinket goes bear noises trinket nudges you and licks your face before looking up  and growling very angrily at the dragon  laura i dont think vex even saw any of that like vex doesnt even know he was unconscious  liam got to go revenant on that bear  matt that is an angry bear and those who have seen the movie know how scary an angry bear is  great pike you still have a little bit of movement if you want to move you have like 15 more feet if /none/  you wanted to use that your call  ashley okay you guys are my eyes so i cant really see it from here but i guess anywhere  theres cover is that a tree  matt you can start moving towards the tree or the front of the keep tree is closer but currently  has two other people hiding there  liam or behind the goliath  ashley what was that  liam behind the goliath  ashley yeah  matt all right you move over here and use grog as cover well say and leap over there /none/ classic  pikegrog technique  laughter  matt cool ends your turn the rest of these survivors on this side of the wall are going to  start fleeing in this direction using their turn to get the hell out these guys here are going to  do a fullround dash to get inside the keep and they manage to make it inside these guys here are  moving back actually no these guys now that are inside the keep are going to run they get almost  all the way to the keep there we go the dwarf gets /none/ about that far this guy almost makes it in  theyre all right at the cusp of getting into the keep screaming and running past you moving  between the different frozen bodies not even paying attention to any of you as the look of  sheer terror on their faces has taken over that brings us to the top of the round percy youre up  taliesin all right im going to drop down like a boss  matt are you going to leap or climb down  taliesin im going to leap  matt all right and roll /none/  taliesin 29  matt 29 success and managed to avoid one of your guards who was right below you you werent aware  and managed to dodge off to the side this way and use the edge of the wall to kick off to change the  trajectory as you land carrying bad news in one hand threepoint landing in the other  laura sick percy  liam hold that gun up from the ground  matt yep just making sure it doesnt damage itself  taliesin okay the next thing im going to do is im going to /dung/ concentrate really hard and im going  to try and conjure hex to see if it works  matt okay so as you focus and look up you can see now some of the fog cloud that surrounds it  congeals into a darker color and clings to the dragons form as it is now hexed by you  taliesin it still works  matt is seems that as long as the shadow entity has been within you though it is no longer bound  to your weapon and yourself it did leave some dark scars on your soul  /none/ liam left a taint upon you  laughter  taliesin so just to remind you that means that he has disadvantage on all agility checks  matt are you choosing dexterity because you choose which one of the  taliesin oh on which checks constitution  matt constitution all right so ill put that down  laura i like it i like it  matt im not sure thats how it works here  someone will yell it later  taliesin ability check on any ability checks  matt on ability checks yes good to know  taliesin im going /none/ to spend a grit point im going to take another shot to try and drop him  matt even further  taliesin yeah just for fun  matt because saving throws are i dont  taliesin are they not because ill use that grit point for something else if  matt i dont believe saves are ability checks unfortunately so that wouldnt affect that yeah  it is its own circumstance  taliesin its its own circumstance in that case im going to spend my point for deadeye  matt okay advantage on the shot  taliesin advantage on the /none/ shot  matt go for it  taliesin and do i want to go nuts im going to go nuts im going to add sharpshooter to that might as well  matt you cannot overlap the shots no only one shot effect on an attack at a time sorry  taliesin thats fine here we go  travis come on go nuts  taliesin both 25  matt 25 hits  taliesin 2d12  matt and add your 1d6 damage as well  taliesin oh thank you for reminding me 17 points of damage plus four points of necrotic damage /none/  matt nice 21 damage total  taliesin im going to use the rest of my movement to duck in there i want to try and spin all the  way back so im completely out of sight is that door open  matt theres a little space there i mean  taliesin open the door  marisha does that lead to our keep  taliesin no its the other door that leads to our keep so were both going to get in and  dualwall it  laura yeah  taliesin and then im going to use my bonus /none/ action to take one of my few remaining potions the medium one  laura does the door actually open on it  matt yeah  laura heh thats so cool  taliesin what does the midrange potion do i should really start writing this down is it one  travis midrange potion  taliesin the secondlevel potion  matt of healing you mean that is  liam 10d10  matt not so much second level greater healing is 4d4 plus four  taliesin 4d4 plus four  matt you got it all right cool that ends percys turn vax youre /none/ up  liam i want to double check the boots of speed that i wear its ten rounds each day the haste  effects duration need not be consecutive rounds so it was one or two back in emon and ive had  one round here  matt thats the old pathfinder rules  liam so what is it ten minutes now i think it remember the tenminute thing  matt no haste lasts for a minute you get to use the spell on you once yeah in this ruleset its a  little too much  liam all right /none/ so im going to dash towards the tree in that corner and get away from this clump  of my friends  matt over this way  liam towards the wall yeah i should be able to get behind that tree i think if i dash  matt if you dash yeah yeah you can get over there behind that way  liam so then im going to throw a dagger its all i can do can i use an action to hide or its  a bonus action only  matt as you throw it the arc just misses /none/ the bottom whats the maximum range on the dagger right  liam whoa im asking if instead of throwing a dagger can i hide instead  matt you could yeah  liam yeah im going to do that im going to do that  matt yeah because right now its at 60 feet away but its at an upward angle from you which  adds a little more distance your dagger would miss it at this range and you would know that  liam so im running ballsout to that tree and im going to go right up against the /none/ tree and  fucking wait and thats it  matt cool all right did you roll stealth  liam oh sure im going to use luck i still have a little luck today good thats better 31  matt 31 good good good okay that ends your turn keyleth youre up  marisha oh god okay im afraid of everything im afraid if i throw up a wall of stone or  anything like that hell be able to be like oh im a fucking dragon so ill go to the other side  of the wall heres what im /none/ going to do im going to start running towards the keep start  running towards the keep im going to go ahead and cast conjure woodland beings and im going to  summon a giant eagle  taliesin yeah  marisha this is dropping my fog cloud since that was real fucking useful  matt so where are you conjuring it  marisha im gonna conjure it right on the other side of him where its i can then have it do an  attack correct in the same turn  matt yeah  marisha i command it to go /none/ for its eyeballs  liam eagle to the fucking face  taliesin eagle to the eye  matt okay  liam oh thats inauspicious  matt all right so as the eagle goes up do you have stats for the eagle  laura that eagle is weally weally close to that dwagon  marisha oh right hes attacking right right he has talons  matt youve got to roll for damage on that  marisha that was more of a distraction  matt which spell is this conjure  marisha conjure woodland beings  matt conjure woodland beings  marisha /none/ its a 4thlevel spell  matt 4thlevel spell thank you all right great  marisha it was a 19 oh wait plus five is 21  matt i have to roll initiative for it separately as part of the spell it rolled a 20  marisha it rolled a 20  matt all right so ill say given that case ill let it go ahead and go immediately but next turn it  starts at 20  marisha okay  matt that is pretty close to what you got  marisha it rolled a 21 on its attack  matt /none/ 21 hits actually  cheering  marisha go eagle go right in the eyes  travis just barely hits or hits  matt its close to barely hitting him  marisha yeah 2d so thats 11 plus three 14 points of damage  matt 14 points of damage as the eagle starts clawing at it you can see the dragon rears back  unexpected to see the sudden giant eagle appear out of the middle of the air and go clawing at its  face you can see it rears back as it does so moving its head out of /none/ the way gets a couple of  scratches in but still an ancient dragon its more spooked than really hurting from the  impact but it caught it off guard  marisha its supposed to be a distraction all right and then i use a bonus action to be like  everyone inside  matt all right thats your turn now it is the white dragons turn lets see if its breath  weapon returns nope it rolled a one so instead its going to ignore the eagle  marisha great  matt as instead it lands right about there /none/  travis it lands  matt it lands impact as it impacts the whole ground shakes around you as you were  pushing trinket you look over your shoulders the shadow encompasses the area and as you look over  you see it land with a heavy impact giant frozen gnashing teeth as mist emanates from the side of  its jaws its going to use its multiattack including its frightful presence i need  everybody everybody to roll a wisdom saving throw  taliesin including us inside  matt yep as it rears back and gives off a horrible /none/ roar that shakes the stones of the actual keep  marisha 23  matt okay  liam 18  travis 18  taliesin seven  laura eight for me  matt oh scanlan rolled a 19  laura and 19 for trinket  taliesin actually im going to spend my resolve and reroll that  matt okay go for it  taliesin ten  matt okay everyone who rolled an 18 or lower it shakes you to your core you suddenly really  realize what you are dealing with here and the fear causes you to fight with the fight /none/ or flight  impulse in your body you are considered frightened  liam too late for luck laughs i got one more charge  travis i cant be charmed or frightened  matt yeah youre still raging so it doesnt affect you  liam nope nope  matt nope okay while you are frightened you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack  rolls while its in your line of sight  laura man i wish we wouldve a fancy feast  matt and you cannot move closer to it willingly you can only move away from it  liam /none/ so attack rolls and what was the other  matt ability checks while you can see it youre so scared of this thing  laura what is it really called  marisha heroes feast  laura fancy feast is way better  matt lower level but helpful  liam singing i like chicken i like liver meow mix meow mix please deliver  travis in the middle of white death  matt its going to make a bite attack against pike and two claw attacks against grog who are  right there so pike you look up as its jaws /none/ come down at you from above thats a natural 20  travis oh fuck shit  matt against you grog two claw attacks that is 23  travis come on taintsmear  matt and 22  travis tickles both of them  matt okay so against you grog you take  laura wait that was against grog  matt the bite was against pike two claws against you so grog you take 15 points of slashing  damage reduced to half because you are raging so eight and the other claw thats a little  higher that is going to /none/ be 18 points of slashing damage so down to nine  laura so wait so pike was the one that took those huge hits  matt the critical bite  laura gasps are you okay pike  ashley i dont know singing critical bite  liam whats pikes ac whats pikes ac  matt 20 but it rolled a critical hit so thats  liam ooh whats that face  taliesin dont do that  matt so 17 times two 34 plus eight 42 points of piercing damage  ashley okay okay okay  matt however you then also suffer /none/ as the freezing jaws clench around you and the cold  surrounds you you suffer an additional that was 42 right  liam i think you just said two you just said two  matt nah nine plus 13 points of cold damage so 55 points of damage total  travis where you at pike  laura are you okay  ashley i am at hold on  liam carry the one carry the three  ashley hold on one second  matt doing math here  laura one second let me check  ashley okay im at 25 could /none/ be worse could be worse  matt that ends its turn  travis are we really fighting this thing or are we running  marisha that what i was about to ask are we fighting or are we running  travis we are getting our fucking asses handed to us  laura is it ancient  travis he keeps saying ancient so its ancient  matt that brings us to vexs turn  laura my turn im feared  matt yeah so you can attack it but you cant move closer to it and have disadvantage on all  your /none/ attacks  taliesin what can we do to unfear  matt you repeat the saving throw at the end of each of your turns or it lasts for a minute  laura okay then im going to use my bonus round to hide stealth  matt okay so go ahead and roll a stealth check  laura 23 were stuck where we are because we cant run closer to it  travis you can run away from it  matt you have disadvantage on the stealth check by the way  laura i did and it was 23  matt /none/ 23 gotcha  marisha whos not feared  laura oh its disadvantage but i had advantage  matt so its just a straight roll  laura even i dont remember what the first  liam i wasnt paying attention  laura should i reroll it  matt well take the 23 its fine okay youre inside and you know its outside and you heard the  roar and shaking and so you can peek around the corner but you cannot move out of the building  you can basically strafe to the side to get a look out as you /none/ want to if you want to fire on it  laura okay i guess ill try to shoot it then  matt okay go for it so disadvantage on both your attacks  laura okay  matt trinket shrugged it off trinket is like whatever i got this  laura oh okay so that was good that was good 26 with disadvantage okay so ill do  the first one right now  marisha if were running i dont want to bust out my good shit  travis weve got to run right i think its stupid if we stay /none/  liam but where do we go if were outdoors were dead  marisha we can go down inside anyways  liam and go where  travis i dont know where can he get inside the keep  liam sure he can dig  laura 22  matt 22 hits  laura because i got sneak attack right because im hiding  matt yes because you are technically hiding and it didnt roll high enough perception  laura okay so 23 was the damage on the first arrow  matt all right was that including the sneak attack d6  /none/ liam i dont know where to go we cant go above ground because were dead  laura now the second one i dont think hits it was like an 18  matt nope that misses so the first one you fire and it manages to hit the creature because it  does not see you it hits to the side of its neck and looks over it goes  laura i duck back behind the wall  matt okay behind the wall you do reveal yourself as part of the strike and it does see you  duck inside and /none/ growls  laura okay and i want to send trinket into the keep if he can make it  matt trinket is going to rush this way  laura is that should i send trinket into the keep  travis yeah  matt it gets an attack of opportunity against trinket  laura balls what really  taliesin but its holding pike so it has no bite  matt well no it didnt grapple her it just bit her and released she managed to get her way out  of its mouth thats going to be a 26 to hit /none/  laura ah jesus it hits come on  matt all right so trinket takes 14 points of slashing damage  laura all right  travis is he good  laura hes fine bearly  matt oh what i see what you did does that end your turn  laura yeah  taliesin did you do a saving throw  matt do your saving throw to see if you shrug off the frightened ability  laura okay so is it wisdom  matt its wisdombased yeah  laura ooh 17 18 19  matt 19 is just what you need /none/ you managed to shake off the fright from this seeing trinket rush  off youre like okay i can do this at the end of your turn the white dragon is going to use  laura im not afraid anymore you hear that  matt its going to go ahead and use two of its actions to do a wing attack  liam shit  matt so every creature within 15 feet of it as its sitting there beats its wings around it and  kicks up all this cold wind and air that blasts out threatening to knock you /none/ off your feet this  is going to affect grog pike and shayne so i need you guys to make a dexterity saving throw  laura pike get out of there  matt dexterity saving throw  ashley im trying im trying  travis i have advantage on those because of danger sense  ashley ah natural 20  travis natural 20  cheering  ashley i dont have any dexterity modifier  matt cool so all right so yeah ill see if shayne shayne does not make it with a two so  shayne takes 15 points of bludgeoning /none/ damage and is knocked prone as she is rushing up shes  dropped her heavy crossbow and shes pulling a weapon out and she rushes up yelling her red hair  blown back from the wind as its beating towards her she gets bludgeoned with the sheer force of  the wind from under the wings and knocked flat on her back at the end of that attack it now gets  to move half its movement and so it there we go a fly speed of 80 its going to move 40 feet so  that will put it /none/ at 20 up this way as it starts backing away and its going to move 20 feet in  this direction  travis i get an attack of opportunity on it right  matt as it pulls away from you yes you do  laura pike gets one too  matt no actually neither of you no grog is the only that does because pike youre too far  away and it has reach on its attacks so it doesnt have to be right up against you to hit you  but you still have to be up against it /none/ to get an attack  travis 22 does that hit  matt that hits yeah  travis okay this is with craven edge five six  laura kill him kill him with craven edge  travis 19 points of damage  matt 19 points of damage got it all right and has to make its constitution save  laura disadvantage  matt not on saving throws 24 resist it all right cool  travis you fucking piece of shit  matt laughs so that ends vexs turn the guards now shayne will get up and shes now going to regret /none/  dropping her crossbow and go over and pick it up again shes not going to have time to fire it  the other two down here are going to be cordell is going to turn around and fire off a  shot as well as kendrick thats a natural one that does hit that does not and that does not  one hit gets through rolling ones like crap thats five points of piercing damage not great  on that round guards then theyre going to start rushing towards the keep here using the  rest of their movement /none/ cordell is going to start moving to the side and start ushering everybody  inside go in go in go in shayne is going to move up next to you grog and essentially begin  to hold the flank with you shoulder to shoulder she as opposed to the crossbow at this point and  seeing the two of you can work together in this regard she pulls out a broadsword thats going  to end the guards turn grog youre up  travis fuck this dragon as much as i would love to protect this house weve got to /none/ get the fuck  out of here is pike right behind me  matt pike is yes  travis can i grab her and run inside the keep  matt if pike will allow it are you going to let grog do that or are you going to fight him on it  ashley no no no  travis no no no i cant do it  ashley no no no grab me and lets go  matt you reach over and grab pike lift her up and the two of you go bolting towards the keep  ashley grog /town/  matt thatll get you right here in the crowd  laura oh jeez dont attack the crowd  travis 50 feet  matt 50 feet but youre also having to push through people so youre getting up well say  travis little meat sticks its not a problem  matt well say as youre pushing through here you get up to the door you guys are right up  there with the full movement  travis ill even damage them i dont give a shit  matt there you go thats your turn the action was to pick her /none/ up okay  travis get out of the way giant beast coming through  matt scanlan at the back seeing you guys rushing in and hes happy to see pike coming into  safety at this point he pulls out his wand again and aims once more with the fireball  travis the dragon giggles  marisha tickles  taliesin technically fire damage should be good  matt fire damage doesnt do anything additional to it  travis dont say it smug like that jeez its our lives  matt 29 damage makes the save so 15 points of fire /none/ damage to it as it blasts from underneath  singes the edge of one of the trees but the white dragon appears to still be not really visibly  hurting yet  travis yep got to go got to go got to go  matt scanlan backs up into the keep at this realization at that point nothing is right in  range so yeah so the white dragon is not going to do anything at this point in time  travis nope  matt you guys hear a voice come ringing out from the north side towards where emon /none/ is a familiar  voice that youve heard before that shouts out enough you are not to linger follow the others  at which point you see the white dragon glances over the shoulder and you hear the voice  again say vorugal and a streak of smoke and red the red dragon you saw that had perched  itself in the center of the city grapples onto the back of vorugal and throws the dragon off the edge  of the wall and goes tumbling to the south of the keep out from the perspective  laura so how /none/ much bigger is vorugal like is he  matt yeah hes roughly double the size of the white dragon  laura holy crap  marisha is this umbrasyl does he refer himself as umbrasyl  matt no you havent heard the name of this one until that point well i mentioned it earlier  marisha no the red dragon  matt the red dragon you havent heard the name of yet umbrasyl is the black dragon raishan was the  green dragon so as you hear the impact you hear the dragon screeching out in anger and no one has /none/  any visual at this point you just hear the sounds over the side you hear it skid to a halt but the  red dragon is still flying and grabs it throws it makes it hit the ground almost like a show of  dominance and as it arcs back around it ignores the keep and heads back towards emon you see  vorugal now lifting back up into the sky staring back at the red dragon as it heads back and you  can see in its general demeanor its frustrated and angry and it begrudgingly begins to /none/ fly towards  the east where you saw the other two dragons continue as the red dragon returns towards the  city its voice is ringing out at a volume that even at this distance is being enhanced by some  sort of arcane means whether it means it wants to be heard and as you can see now as it hits  over the far south walls of emon it shouts out once more hear me insects you that live do so  out of mercy fight or flee and you forfeit that mercy know that your pitiful guardians /town/ brought  this upon you that blood is on their hands vengeance has been swift and in its wake a new  age is upon you making its way towards the center of the city be thankful for until now  your lives had no purpose no meaning abandon your gods your paltry convictions for now you  have a new purpose to serve me and with that you hear the clattering impact once more of the  cloudtop district as a halfdozen buildings collapse under its weight as it slams into the  center of what probably still stood /none/ tall in the middle of the city of emon you hear the crumbling  wreckage echoing in the distance as it slides to a halt and a couple of distant slamming sounds as  it makes its way into the central borough where the palace once was quiet now takes the air as  all the people are still standing frozen in fright of what they just saw and slowly begin making  their way into the keep whispering shaking crying under their breaths the survivors that are  not frozen in the center of greyskull keeps courtyard what do /none/ you want to do  travis pee  laughter  matt that is entirely viable  liam everyone we need to go inside  taliesin yes  marisha is this because of us  laura can we heal the frozen people is it possible  matt you guys make you way out towards the people currently frozen in the courtyard what did you  want to use cure wounds  laura yeah sure  matt okay you use what level  laura two  matt two all right  liam how many people are frozen  matt currently id say /none/ about 14 people are frozen in the courtyard  liam can we all do medicine checks on them  matt six of them are partially shattered like as part of the impact their bodies shattering ice  and part of the torso busted arms missing upper bodys missing as you cast your 2ndlevel cure  wounds spell and reach out and touch the person to heal them a crack forms where your hand touched  the body and shattering ice before the upper part of their torso head and leg breaks into  ice and you get the feeling looking /none/ around that these individuals are beyond saving at this point  marisha its too long its too late  liam inside everyone inside now  travis yeah we all go inside  liam come along  matt all right so you guys make your way inside the keep people are looking about some people  are running through rooms trying to find a place to keep safe you can see already in the armory  theres like a family in there that are huddling crouched in the corner some people have moved on  towards the kitchen people are shouting /none/ trying to see if anybody they lost eye contact with is  inside you hear a couple of people shouting names shawn shawn kayla different names  being shouted as if theyre hoping that someone they got separated from may have made it in  couple do a few seem to continue to shout fruitlessly but the inside energy of the keep is  one of tension fear and mounting sadness  laura can i find erwen  matt you can you told the people within the keep to go downstairs  laura yeah i go and find him and /tavern/ tell him to start setting up as many beds as he can as many  in the cathedral that we have to in the chapel to maybe give some of these people places to stay  for the time being  matt all right so  ashley can i go into the temple  matt you can as you head downstairs too you can see jarett is still there sitting with his  crossbow on his lap and hes been doing his last duty which was to watch over your workshop and  as you come down the stairs he /none/ goes whats going on i heard noises upstairs is everyone all right  taliesin no  laura everythings

you please  taliesin i step inside my workshop  travis may i come in  taliesin yes of course  travis can you shut the door  taliesin is there anywhere private in this place at this point  laura nobody is in the workshop yet  matt nobody is in the basement or workshop area everyone is seemingly scattered on the  base floor of the keep  taliesin all right  travis can you lock it  taliesin all right  travis listen the skull we took out of the house i havent /dung/ told you but it grants a wish  and only those that dark things have touched can use it thats you and thats me as far as i  know it said it wanted you but i wasnt going to let him have you it grants a wish we can change  all of this i feel like it was there in case the dragons came out of that portal it was facing the  inside of the room it moves and theres something in there i feel like its a weapon  what the fuck else are we going /none/ to do we go for more help itll get killed coming into this city  were not strong enough to take four of these fucks  taliesin we have an opportunity here but were going to have to be careful  travis im listening  taliesin all right were going to need more than just you we are going to need a few of the  others just in case  travis they have to be touched  taliesin this is how its going to work im going to take it out im going to have you go  im /none/ going to remove it from its hiding place while you go get the rest of them from upstairs  travis but who  taliesin at the very least vax keyleth at the very least  travis keyleth shes bleached whiter than whitestone  taliesin exactly we need good people and im going to try and talk to it to try and discern  what it is and how it works and what it wants and if for some strange reason things go wrong i need  people who would be more than willing to at the very least knock me /none/ out so im going to be  needing you and at least one other preferably a magic user ready to deal with me if something goes weird  travis i step closer to percy i think you only need me  taliesin i need one other just in case  travis name one other  taliesin keyleth or vax pick your choice honestly whoever is less busy upstairs  travis all right i leave  taliesin im going to take the skull out of the hiding place so he doesnt see  where im removing it from  matt okay /tavern/ while this is happening pike keyleth vax vex scanlan all of you guys begin  helping the guards take beds out of your rooms and bring them downstairs into the main foyer area  basically turning this into a makeshift living space for refugees heading towards and moving  them into the temple of sarenrae as you go into the temple of sarenrae you get a bit of a feel of  the damage that was sustained from the impact of the dragon upon the top of the keep  marisha i follow pike into the temple  matt a /tavern/ large portion of the stained glass on the roof and on the outside has been shattered from  rocks and boulders that were chunks of the top of the keep that were knocked off and looking up  you can see the roof of the keep itself sustained a fair amount of damage not enough to really be a  serious issue but it is in a bit of disrepair visually as you guys are taking the beds from the  upstairs to the downstairs you do notice that a portion of the roof has caved in on the second /none/  floor the guest room has been ruined and the southmost room which ill have to check to see  whos supposed to be living there is partially collapsed inwards and you can see the ceiling  the sky from underneath there is a fair amount of damage to the top of the keep from the impact  marisha i back into a corner in the temple and collapse into a corner  matt okay  ashley i would like to go over to a quiet spot in the temple and start saying a prayer and id like  to /none/ cast planar ally you beseech an otherworldly entity for aid so i would  like to call on sarenrae  matt all right let me pull this up what level is this  ashley its a 6thlevel  matt all right lets see here  ashley you have to ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment  matt mmhm yeah what would you like to do  ashley well i think if i say sarenrae ive been rebuilding your temple for months so please  help us in battle and help rebuild our city if thats /none/ service enough  matt okay so as you reach out you feel sarenraes warmth come to you wordless  attempting to comfort but even then there is a trepidation in sarenrae who is you gather  yourself still taking in the circumstances that have happened you feel that warmth begin to  coalesce into a specific form and everyone who has come into the temple with you gasps aloud as  over these central worship platforms in the center of the temple a glowing orb begin to form that  then slowly takes the form of a humanoid with wings /none/ similar to the ones youve worn in your  celestial form as the light fades you can see levitating roughly a foot off the ground a human  white eyes and pale blue skin hairless with a simple breastplate thats silver with gold lining  on it a single sword sheathed on the side and beautiful white angel wings sprouting from its  back the entity stands there and looks down towards you i have been sent to your aid are  you pike trickfoot to give me a task the voice itself seems otherworldly and understanding the  basis /none/ of the spell you need a specific task in mind for it and it is expensive to maintain in  materials the longer the task requires  ashley okay we need your help as you can see our city has fallen to pieces by these dragons  that are attacking us and we ask that you aid us in battle somehow  matt lead me to a battle if you wish i havent much time on your plane if you have a task that i  can complete at this moment and you know that to maintain this spell cost /none/ about 100 gold per minute  ashley okay ah shit okay  matt or 1000 gold per hour depending on the or 10000 gold per day yeah it depends on the task  it required it needs to be a little more specific than just aid us in battle because if there  isnt a immediate battle happening because the longer its out the more expensive it will be  you asked it to rebuild and it looks to you and says if you require my aid in rebuilding she  looks with her head around the temple this i /none/ can help with quite a bit of haste as it is within  the realm of our patron lady  ashley okay well yes rebuild our keep  matt it will be done within the hour so you can mark off 1000 gold worth of materials and at  this point the planar allys wings unfurl and begin to float up and as it does it lift its  hands and all the shattered stained glass begins to lift off the ground with it and you watch as  they all begin to reform  laura thats pretty sick  /none/ matt and begin to through pure divine energy rebuild the entirely of the temple around within a  matter of minutes while everyone else is looking in awe you can begin to see around you many  people who had been shaken to the core of their being who had lost all hope even this visual  representation of the power of sarenrae and the faith you put into her you can see people are now  bowing in deep prayer at the center of the temple as its being rebuilt this has been a very  impactful moment for /none/ the survivors youve taken under your wing  marisha i wander over to pike and just i grab her hand as i watch  matt all right  laura im busying myself trying to bandage any of the survivors that seem injured  matt okay there are injuries many sustained from rubble falling or trying to get out as fast  as possible slamming themselves into ruins or fallen rock and flaming or whatever else happened  so you tend to the wounds so you guys are helping out with those who are hurt  liam im helping and as /none/ we do so i say i dont know whats going to happen in the following  hours do not go far from me if we are out of earshot you are too far from me  do not go far from me  laura do you think this is what do you think this is what mother saw before she died  liam do not go far from me  laura i wont i swear  matt percy and grog you find your way back up to the foyer  taliesin the second he leaves the keep i rush to /none/ pull the skull out shut the door put it on the  table sit down in front of it and say okay talk you have my attention  matt okay  taliesin okay i got a minute before he comes back  matt you do you do  laura hes a dick  liam hes just a sociopath thats all  no audio  travis fire and ice sale  laura hey check out those critical role shirts on geekandsundrycom they sure are lovely  marisha donate to 826la  marisha oh god i feel like i should scootch over /none/  laura i know cant hear it  liam that is a long talk  taliesin softly at what price  laura ugh what is he saying oh my god  matt all right sorry  taliesin i then take the velvet cloth and put it back over it and put it over and set it up as if i  havent talked to it  matt okay all right so and once again reminding you the skull itself its humanoid but  its elongated its not a human skull its jaw itself is you would say almost elvish but /none/ the  features are too sunken the teeth are too long and the skull itself is a little more oblong to  the back yeah youre unfamiliar what species or race this may have been when it was alive  travis as i was leaving can i notice anything about the back of his door like is a lock or is  it flat plain  matt im gonna go ahead and have you make an investigation check  travis 13 minus two you asshole  laughter  matt as you start walking out you turn and look at the /none/ door and take a moment to inspect it i  mean grog doors are doors you know how to deal with doors this is a weird door you dont know  how this door works  taliesin my door is unlocked  matt right but he doesnt understand the mechanism of what  taliesin oh no i built with you in mind  travis i bet i can figure the lock from the inside and i open the door and it opens because  its unlocked  matt okay right as soon as you throw the velvet over the door /none/ opens up  travis i go up and i try and find vax  matt okay you go up and you see the two of them helping people along making eye contact you can  see the drying tears across their faces as they are trying to stay strong for those that are  currently in a less emotionally stable position right now  travis sorry to break up an awkward moment vax do you have a moment  liam what do you need  travis may i speak to you alone no offense vex  laura none taken i /none/ go and help other people and call to trinket to carry over some bandages for me  matt okay  travis you and i may have had some friction recently and we have our differences but were  on the same side percy needs you downstairs will you

sure this is going to go dandy  19 laughs  laura fucking a  travis i dont know why im so excited right now everythings dead  laura 15  matt as youre walking away you feel this strange pulse of tingling energy almost like a soft  laura aw you know what  matt what  laura i havent chosen my fucking rogue ability yet my rogue proficiency  liam rogue proficiency bump /none/  laura too late now  matt you feel this magical essence creep up on you you are not familiar with it but you feel  like something just attached to you  travis from any direction or just attached  matt you arent entirely

make this one quick guys get back into it while we still have the tension in  the story going so well see you guys here in a few minutes  travis /dung/ five minutes five minutes  liam five minutes pizza and five minutes  matt you good  laura is the food here  matt it should be i hope so  break  matt hi my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor and the dungeon master for geek and sundrys  critical role and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master or  game master your own roleplaying games  so today our first topic is going to be encounter building so when you are creating an encounter a  combat /dung/ encounter specifically for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else you  are running you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have thats  going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there what type of  challenges might be in that way so consider is it a icy tundra is it a frozen mountaintop or is  it like a hot muggy swampland is it a underground cave network there are actually a lot  of these resource books that you can find /none/ for these rpgs that will have listings of creatures  and monsters and dangers by topography and by weather and thats a really cool way to see what  indigenous creatures might live there and thats a good resource to pull from if youre not having  any creative juices helping you decide what to put in front of them  secondly you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be do you  want it to be a really quick scuffle do you want it to be a series of small battles as to /dung/ opposed  to fighting in a long hallway in a spaceship do you want it to be one giant climatic multileveled  boss confrontation once youve made that decision thatll help you figure out how  dangerous how extensive and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter theres a lot  of great resource manuals for every rpg system out there that have breakdowns about what creatures  are good for which player levels as far as power or challenge and danger is concerned like for  instance the dungeon masters guide and monster manual have a challenge /dung/ rating system a creature  of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four players of that  level and you can slide the scale from there  also the dmg or the dungeon masters guide has a experience threshold table in there as well that  helps you build encounters based on the total experience points the creatures are fighting so  those are really cool resources if youre new to the system and youre still trying to figure out  how to balance that properly over time eventually youll just get a feel /none/ for it  experience helps you get a little more comfortable with balancing the battle and you want to make  sure you dont kill all your players way too quickly in the game either theres also a really  good website called kobold fight club for those who are running dungeons  dragons 5th edition  campaigns that helps them build an entire encounter with the experience table stuff that  helps you get an idea of what could and could not be considered too powerful  and dont forget if you cant find a creature or monster in /none/ these realms or any sort of villain  that suits your need for the storyline or this particular battle you can create one make one up  or take something thats there and customize it and alter it make it more powerful make it  weaker you know if you really really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main  villain but all your players are level ten go ahead and make yourself some more powerful  kobolds you can customize em all you want everything in there is just a baseline suggestion /none/  of what they think or they created initially to be but you can always scale them you can make  them more powerful you can add additional hit points make them do more damage per attack  increase their defenses give it some hidden resistances or vulnerabilities you can even  create whole new abilities i customize creatures all the time for my game i think it one makes  it more interesting and more customized to the specific encounter and world secondly for  players who have been playing for a long time and pretty much memorized the /none/ monster manual it keeps  them on their toes because theyll be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything  about also make sure though if you do use these creatures and you want them to have  interesting defenses and vulnerabilities and the like make sure you highlight them or note them  its very easy to rush into combat and forget some of these cool things so i always use a  highlighter and highlight the various notes and elements of these creatures or these combat  scenarios that i want to make sure that i /none/ remember and recall in the heat of battle  the next note i want to bring up is battlefields first and foremost not every game needs a  battlefield in fact i kind of prefer rpgs that dont have a battle map with miniatures its just  a way to play i prefer to keep things in my imagination but thats generally more wieldy with  smaller groups if you have three maybe four players larger than that it gets a little  unwieldy and me running six to eight players it has become very necessary for everyone to keep /none/  track of their spatial awareness when you create a map things to consider creative terrain you  know think of where its are happening but ways to make it different on occasion too you can  have straight forward battles with just heres an area where they fight heres some hallways  heres some rooms and thats cool too but if youre in an urban setting have furniture they  can use to their advantage whether it be for height or for setting up blockades  also consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have with the terrain /none/  during the battlefield is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually get to the  villain while theyre attacking them from a distance is there some sort of arcane field  thats locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some sort of puzzle during  the battle to lock it down is invulnerable to all damage until they can find some sort of hidden  aspect of their soul locked within a nearby battlefield or is there a bunch of innocents in  there as well that are in /none/ danger of being killed from the collateral damage find cool and unique  ways to make it an interesting battle outside of a slug fest of hp being knocked away and whoever  falls first mind you those can be fun too on occasion but you want to make sure  to keep things interesting  for those who want to create battlefields what i use for my battlefields because it has been  requested a few times you can use easel pad paper oneinch grid easel pad paper that you can  find online and thats a real cool /none/ way to draw on that using markers and create your own  battlefields that way there are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles  and interestinglooking terrain with simple hatchmark shading and minor colors so i highly  recommend that  also when youre using intelligent creatures especially monsters or individuals or villains  that are understanding their own mortality they may flee when they hit about half or a quarter  hit points they maybe want to get the heck out of dodge so dont be afraid to let your villains or  /none/ enemies do that on occasion one it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from a slog fest  to oh crap hes getting away and the dynamic shifts to try and prevent them from doing so and  secondly if they do manage to get away you may have a juicy villain who can recur later on down  the story with a need for vengeance vengeance  another cool note not all battles are meant to be won either sometimes you want to introduce a  really powerful enemy as a foreshadowing aspect a creature that they can /town/ in no way shape or form  defeat and they are meant to flee from so that they can build towards down the road maybe coming  back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance just make sure you try and insinuate to  the players that they shouldnt stick around for the whole fight or you might have a tpk on your  hands so be careful with that one its a fun tool but be careful no seriously be careful  plus it also leaves a cool story like man you remember that one time we /none/ almost got killed by  that thing  not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed as well so dont be afraid to let the players  diplomatically resolve an encounter sometimes battles happen because of misunderstandings or  misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off that doesnt mean they have to  fight to the bitter end and murder whoevers in front of them you dont want the whole murderhobo  syndrome to be consistent unless thats the campaign youre running in which case fight on  my murderhobos but let the players /none/ use their social skills to try and defuse an encounter  before anyone gets killed ive many games where halfway through a battle theyre like wait  they may have information we need or maybe we were duped and have the wrong information and  they decide to diplomatically end it it doesnt always work but its nice to give them that option  break  matt all righty guys welcome back so before jumping in here real fast we got a couple things  one we have a winner for our next giveaway for all you awesome subscribers out /none/ there the winner  is blackshadow773  cheering  matt appropriate place for a shoutout  laura thats really appropriate  matt well send you an awesome package with a bunch of goodies critical role goodies some  signed stuff some fun things coming your way so thats fun also i forgot to do it in the  announcements earlier but i have a couple of new music tracks and some things coming forward that  ill be able to incorporate into the game from awesome guys named battlebards they did a  kickstarter a while back to create rpgspecific /none/ music and sound effects and audio tracks and they  were nice enough to give me some of their stuff to use in the show so if youre running your own  game and want some good music and soundscape stuff to work on battlebards got some pretty cool  stuff so thank you guys all righty so returning as it was grog and vax you make your  way down to the basement of greyskull keep the doors still partially ajar as grog left it you  enter the room  travis before we go in i would like /dung/ to put my hand on vax just a note i tried to do this by  myself but the skull asked for percy i know he didnt respond well with all that dark shadowy  stuff so be careful im not entirely sure we can trust him with it i wanted to do it myself but it  was either you or keyleth and youre a prick so i picked you  liam i dont say anything  matt okay you guys enter percy is there waiting hands behind his back there is the table  on one of his /none/ workbench areas that has a piece of tapestry that you guys originally had wrapped the  skull in draped over it its currently not visible  liam whats going on percival  taliesin good i felt that this was only possible if we had a few more witnesses we have an  artifact  liam good  taliesin a skull there is something alive inside the skull there is something evil or at least  not good inside the skull and it is offering to grant us any wish we desire if we set it free  now grog is /none/ inclined to take this deal i am and i imagine this is surprising having some  reservations i like having the terms spelled out and i feel that so far the terms have not been  spelled out im going to lift the fabric off  travis i go and shut the door  matt okay and as you lift the fabric off and you have a look at it as well in this controlled  environment still facing you the skull which once again has the elongated form the longer  teeth and jaw it has the one gem /none/ thats embedded in the eye socket and you can see theres a  little bit of almost like a spectral swirl to it like theres something fluid in the actual gem  itself  liam well freddie i imagine im wondering the same thing you are at least i hope and thats  whats in it for the skull  taliesin he wants to be freed it how would we free you  matt theres a slight pause before you can see the gem the swirl coalesces into what looks like  a spectral face you can make out what /none/ looks to be eyes a mouth and a nose though the nose itself  is less of a pronounced human nose and  liam im looking at the floor im not looking at it  matt okay but you see where the nose is instead there are two nasal passages and you hear a voice  slowly creak out from it and say all that i require is for you to destroy this prison free my  spirit from generations of torment that is all i ask  liam hey quick question who are you who were you before you /none/ were in this prison  matt its been too long too long have i been here i do not know who i am  liam ah well go fuck yourself and i put the blanket over it  matt the blanket covers the skull  liam this seems like a very bad idea to me why are we doing this didnt we do this already once  before  taliesin it was an option and i felt it was worth exploring and i think now we do have an  option which is we have to take it somewhere and /none/ have him identified we have to know who this is  travis what are you talking about if it wants to be set free fuck him its a wish its like a  genie that wants out of a can you dont grant it its wish you get your fucking wish first  taliesin its not always genies in cans  liam if we wish to rid emon of these dragons then weve got nothing to deal with this fucking  thing right here whatever it is  taliesin i would like to know before we make any deals we /town/ need a name  travis hold on hold on hold on look we have a chance to do good now right now people are  dying more people are dying  taliesin we have a chance to kick the can down the road  travis i dont understand  liam hes speaking literally grog  taliesin we dont know that whatever is in here could be worse than whats out there  liam i had a thought  taliesin but we could find out and since its a wish well have plenty of room to fix this we  dont /none/ have to do it immediately  travis are you a betting man percival  taliesin yes  travis if i told you that four giant ancient fuckoff death dragons were attacking the city and  all of us barely managed to break one of its pinky toes youre saying whats in there is worse than them  taliesin i dont know its in there isnt it and how do we know the dragons werent guarding it  as opposed to it being a signal it could be the thing theyre angry about  liam i think i have a thought /none/ i havent spoken out loud yet every divine being that exists is  accessible through vasselheim we are not equipped to handle this problem maybe this skull will do  something maybe thats a bit fucking maybe were not equipped and we dont know what dealing  with that thing will bring we will go to vasselheim tomorrow we bring all the people in  this keep with us keyleth sends them through the tree they stay there we find help we cannot  handle this on our own my first instinct was to go back in for uriel we /none/ dont know whats  happened to uriel but we cant do it we are powerless against those things against one of  them let alone four we need help  taliesin i wave my hand and the skull drops into a shadow on the table and vanishes  matt okay  liam did that blanket just blob down  taliesin the blanket vanished into the shadow as well its now just a shadow ive put it back in  its hiding place  travis what the fuck was that  taliesin that was a reminder that you should know what /none/ youre dealing with before you touch power  travis can you do magic  taliesin yes im not going to pretend i always make the best calls but i at least would like to  know its name  travis sighs fucking pussy we have a chance to save this city now  taliesin we have a chance to stop anything worse from happening or we have a chance to unleash  something far worse on it  liam grog know your strengths it is your strength  taliesin i am a betting man and this is a bad bet /dung/  travis can i walk up to the shadow table  matt yeah yeah  travis can i start looking around it do i see anything  matt it looks like theres the dark spot on the table and as you reach your hand out its just a  solid table  liam i look at percival we need to talk to the girls  matt and as you reach your hand past that into the shadow because i assume that this is the  taliesin you know exactly what i did is he reaching or is he  travis /dung/ i did not reach im looking on top of it on the sides underneath  matt yeah currently it looks like literally where the cloth and skull once were there is a dark  spot and shadow  travis no button no latches no holes for quarters  matt nope  laura im knocking on the door  taliesin your plan is good it just requires a little bit more study its a good plan  travis study  laura are you in there  taliesin yes come please come in  laura i open the door  matt unlocked /none/ vex walks in  laura well whats this big master plan youre all plotting  taliesin vex vax do you want to well actually we might as well get keyleth down here  as well  liam pike as well  taliesin pike keyleth meet me in my im going to walk and attempt to gently scoop the skull up  and put it behind me  matt okay  liam to catch things up i walk out the door and im going to get the other two  laura did i notice that i have a really good passive /none/ perception  matt you do you see him scoot go over to the table and move something behind his back  travis who did  laughter  matt you dont know you head up to the main foyer area where the stairs come up through the armory  and lead into to the main hallway that bisects the center of the main floor just as keyleth and pike  are coming out of the temple after being summoned  liam all

23 okay good looking at them both theyre still very guarded and you are  unable to really  laura both /none/ of them seriously matt  matt yeah i mean it doesnt absolve any of your suspicion by any means but theyre both locked in  this intense stareoff and you in the center of it as you dart back and forth to try and see any  give any twitch anything that would possibly show an ounce of what is going on in their heads  its the best poker faces youve seen on either of them in a while  liam are we at the door yet  matt you guys are now getting to the door  liam /none/ hey big man trickfoot

feel the door slamming you in the back grog  travis okay  taliesin or pick who you trust i trust your judgment  travis trust vex listen to me what did you see  laura whos your friend  travis sighs the skull grants a wish it can only be used by those with dark presence around  them thats percy thats me how /dung/ has percy done with dark shit in the past i went to him for help  because im trying to free the city of these fucking dragons but it wanted percy i tried to  keep it for myself and now hes up to his shady shit all over again  laura it specifically wants percy  travis it wanted percy  taliesin and i said no  travis the hell you did  marisha yelling wait who wanted who  ashley can we wiggle in  matt you can try to but grog you hold the door shut the /none/ doors not moving  liam okay im going to quick rapidfire i was hoping to bring everybody in but say listen to  me percys got this fucking skull and we everything about it its a skull its talking  about granting a wish its fucking fucked up just like the fucking smoke demon that was in percival  i dont understand whats going on yet but both grog and percival are a little fucked up but grog  is more fucked up but i dont understand everything but things are not good  marisha what  ashley whats going /none/ on  marisha hearing vax unload that information if i reach through the crack in the door can i touch grog  matt theres just enough of a gap where you could probably get an arm through  marisha like my tiny little female hand  matt pike what are you doing  ashley can i push the door open or at least try  matt try to pike make a strength check  ashley yeah go first go first  marisha i reach through and if i can grab grog i cast hold person on him  travis cool /none/ ill stay right where i am  marisha well then we can push him over right  matt you can try yeah all right so hold person does it require  travis i weigh like 600 pounds  marisha theres three of us we can push real hard  liam we can get jarett  matt all right so looking at hold person here hold on just a second  marisha oh wait wait can i redact that can i redact that  travis no you already said it  matt it has to be a humanoid you can see /none/ within range so you couldnt even hold person  through the door  marisha beautiful even better  taliesin you read the spell didnt you  liam scanlan scanlan join us please quickly please  matt scanlan goes im trying to help some folks but if you insist all right  liam i do i do insist  travis vex if he has the skull weve got to get it from him now  laura percy  taliesin i have the skull im not going to use it i dont trust him not to use it yet  laura how /dung/ about you guys give me the skull im not even touched by anything dark  travis thats a great idea  taliesin thats fair  travis yeah give her the skull  taliesin all right i pull it out from behind me and hand it to you its in the bag wrapped in cloth  laura oh god im going to get fucking attacked by grog im going to back up into a corner and  hold on to it and look down at it  matt okay  laura im holding onto it jesus  matt you are holding /none/ onto it and its wrapped in the tapestry that you guys threw over it  originally but you can feel it in your hands and its not terribly heavy it has some heft to it  and just having it there youre already getting pins and needles on the back of your neck  liam now shorthalt now  marisha is he trying to bamf in scanlan  matt no no so pike what are you doing  ashley i want to try and push in the door open  matt okay make a strength check grog make a strength /none/ check  ashley with all my strength  taliesin i love you travis  laughter  marisha while she pushes can i get up against the crack to see if i can see through while she pushes  travis 17  ashley eight  matt the door lurches but you hold it solidly in place you can feel  ashley grog let me in  travis just a fuck just a minute  ashley ive been waiting five minutes  laughter  taliesin put your pants on grog really  liam just another minute mom  laura i think this /none/ is probably the stupidest thing why did i decide to hold it  travis give me the skull you dont want percy to have it  laura i dont want either of you to have it  taliesin dont give me the skull but dont give him the skull either  travis if you want to you can ask it what it wants and then youll know or you can give it to  me and we can be done with this  marisha are we trying to hand grog the evil things  laura i take the tapestry off /none/ it and i ask it what the fuck do you want what the fuck are you  what the fuck is this  matt as you look down at the skull which you guys still cant get through because grogs  holding the door and you dont have a visual in there because hes holding it pretty close to  completely shut as you look down you can see now in the gem formulating in the middle of it this  swirl of a face that comes right up to the front you can see in the midst of its /none/ coloration  these energybased eyes and grin a toothy grin that goes i wish to be freed that is all ive  been here far too long i grow tired i want to finally pass  laura are you vecna  matt you hear a chuckle no vecna has been long gone i am not a being of such power  laura can i insight check the fucking thing in the eyeball  matt sure make a insight check  laura sure no problem unless it was a natural 20 it doesnt matter 15 no  matt 15 you dont /none/  laura no way higher than 15 21  matt okay 21 thank you  laura 22 i can add  matt 22 okay thats way higher you take a look at it but due to the fact that its mostly  hidden there arent facial tics and there arent normal gives to what a persons intent is and  even the tone of voice itself is spectral ominous and otherworldly you have a hard time being able  to read whether or not its being honest or lying or anything in between  liam scanlan here yet  laura /none/ why would we free it  matt scanlan is now behind the door on the other side and he enters the room with you guys and is  like whats going on everything cool  liam wait the door is open now  matt no hes with you guys  liam ah good yeah bigby that shit  travis i bum rush vex  ashley no dimension door me in please  taliesin i think we need a name for the thing  travis i bum rush vex  taliesin im using quick draw  marisha what  matt initiative /none/ rolls from both of you guys  taliesin yeah  marisha does this mean the door flies open  ashley yeah the door flies open  matt just a moment  liam this is all seconds this is happening in seconds  travis 14  laura do i roll anything can i do anything  taliesin 28  travis ugh jesus 28  matt ill say roll with disadvantage because it catches you entirely offguard  laura so this is a surprise attack ugh thats lame that was just 13  matt okay and you had a  travis 14 /none/  matt 14 okay all right so you see grog lower his head and then go for a burst run across the  length of the workshop towards vex you instinctually go quick draw what are you doing  taliesin im shooting a warning shot past his head diving in taking the  laura are you close enough i backed into a corner  taliesin ive got six spaces of movement in my turn  matt yeah its not a big room  taliesin diving and grabbing the head and curling back around  travis the head the skull  /none/ taliesin grabbing the skull and going  travis shes 5050 distance between us  taliesin im moving first  matt okay  taliesin and im happy to spend an action surge if thatll make this work better  laura do you think you can just grab it from me  liam dd standoff  taliesin i can make a roll for it  matt so as you dart percy is waiting for someone to also dart and both of you go rushing  across the room percy manages to get there a fraction of a second before you do you /none/ hear the  blast of his pistol past your ear and the ringing hits the center of your head but you still  continue pushing forward in the way that grog does ignoring all outside interference however  youve gotten to the skull first are you going to attempt to wrestle it from her  taliesin gently pull it out of his run so im going pull it  laura are you going to try to pull me out of the way or just the fucking skull you dick  matt shes pretty grappled to it  taliesin oh if /none/ shes that grappled to it then im going to try and push her out of the way of grog  matt okay opposed strength checks from both of you  laura from me  matt yeah make a strength check  travis he doesnt seem to care much  laura he really really doesnt  taliesin 15  laura ah thats terrible nine  taliesin its less of a shove and more of a pull out of the way of grogs rush  matt right so he reaches over and grabs the skull in your arm and pulls you  /none/ taliesin well i grab her  matt right she but you havent pulled it from her grip you pull her out of the way shoves you  to the side you go rushing forward and as you get there she is pulled to the side she is still  right there in front of you but the bum rush didnt get you there before anybody could react  so now its your turn  laura its my turn  matt yeah wait you rolled a 13  laura i rolled a 13  matt oh never mind grog goes next /none/ grog so you rush up and you can now see percy pistol out  hand on the side of vex off the side of her arm shes holding the skull there and theyre both  looking at you expectantly what are you doing to do  travis i want percy im going to tackle percy  matt you what  travis i am going to run straight towards percy and tackle him  matt tackle him okay all right so lets get some proper rumble music for this  marisha there are dragons outside and were fighting playing rugby with /none/ a fucking skull  travis im trying to fix the dragons  matt okay so you use the momentum of the rush and you see him do this you turn out of the way  and go for a shoulder shove i want you to go ahead and make an attack roll actually make an  athletics roll versus your acrobatics  travis why cant that be higher 19  taliesin ah shit 14  matt 14 i need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw  taliesin oh shit 17 oh saving throw 21  matt /none/ 21 you slam into him and you essentially shove him with the shoulder you manage to knock  him prone but the skull doesnt come loose he loses his grip on it and currently vex is still  holding it front of you youre prone on the ground  taliesin im prone on the ground  travis so vex still has it  taliesin but its vexs turn  travis but i knocked him off of her but youve still got the skull  taliesin i wasnt trying to wrestle it  matt anything else you want to try and /none/ accomplish  travis yeah i would like to turn and put my back to vex because she has the skull  matt okay so you go and plant a protective position in front of her its now your turn grog who  rushes over and shoulder slams percy out of the way and hes fallen to the ground his gun almost  scatters to the floor of the workshop around you as youre expecting he turns towards you instead  he steps and his giant frame is now blocking you with the shoulder blades in front his arms out in /none/  a defensive position facing off with people as they begin to enter the room what are you going  to do  laura i reach up and i touch his back and i say are you yourself  travis me  laura yes you fuck  travis yeah yes fuck its me  laura i back up into a corner and i say what is all this about why do you even need this why do  we want to set it free i dont understand  travis we dont we dont we just dont want him to have /none/ percy  marisha the rest of us see this now right  matt at this point now the doors burst open and the rest of you guys rush in and you can see  percy just as he hits the ground you can see grog recovering from the shoulder slam who then steps  in front of vex with this snarl on his face and begins shouting to her over his shoulder and you  hear them talking across the room  taliesin it doesnt want me i dont want to use the skull i want to keep you from /none/ using it  ashley what is going on in here  marisha keyleth cracks her staff on the floor and does a gust cantrip and goes whoosh to make a  big burst of wind in the room  matt okay tools go falling off the wall and clattering to the stone floor of the  establishment all of you who have hair have it blown and wrapped around you you are pushed back  about three inches from the burst of it and all of you immediately your attention goes to  keyleth who stands there with her staff /none/  travis is it dusty in there now or is it just windy  matt its not dusty its covered in layers of soot that have now been kicked up and the air  itself is a temporary fume  travis do we have an order  marisha silence  matt she does that pike what are you doing  ashley can i insightcheck grog  matt yeah go for it  ashley 21  matt what are you trying to know  travis what are you trying to know  ashley i want to know why he wants this /none/ skull so bad  matt okay if you would like to relay any information she peered pretty well into your  demeanor  travis i want to get rid of the dragons now  matt so you gather that hes coming from a place that a simple mind is looking for a simple  solution to a complex problem  laughter  laura im right here matt  taliesin burn burn  travis oh oh the flames ah  laughter  travis stop drop and roll  matt im saying thats the best way she can discern your demeanor right /none/ now pike anything  else you want to do right now we have to continue this  ashley yep can i walk over and grab craven edge  matt craven edge is currently sheathed on his back away from you so you can attempt to if you  want to  ashley grog can you give me craven edge please  matt pike hands out to you and looking you earnestly in the face  travis why  ashley i just want to look at it  marisha pike you sure about this  ashley i just want to see /none/ somethings not quite right  taliesin can i get up at this point or no  matt we are about to get back to the top of the round so you do what youre doing okay percy  taliesin im going to stand up and grab a poker off the table im leaving my gun on the floor  matt not off the table the wind gust knocked off a lot of these things on the ground small pile of  tools next to you so you grab the poker  taliesin i grab a poker and i take a /none/ corner  matt okay so now percy youve squared off into a corner theres vex in the other corner grogs  standing in between the two with the back against vex the three of you are right there at the  front pike has stepped up to grog now and is beseeching him thats percy grog youre up  travis i look at pike i turn around i look at vex youll thank me and id like to try and pull  the skull out of her hands  matt okay go ahead and make a strength check against her /none/  laura oh jeez oh come on theres no way even if i roll like a unless i get a 20  travis 21  laura no thats 14  matt all right as grog turns around and gives you almost an apologetic look his face steels  over with intensity as lightningfast his muscular arms rush out in front grasp the skull  like tearing a toy from a childs grasp it is removed from you with barely any sort of  resistance  marisha can i get a spell off on him  matt not yet so grog /none/ thats your action you grab and you have now the skull you left her with  the tapestry like you have just the bare skull in front of you  travis what would i like to do with it  matt you have a bonus action so depends on what youre trying to accomplish  travis can i spike it  matt you can yeah id say yeah  taliesin thats a bonus action  matt id say this would be your movement and bonus ill let you do that the whole thing  together  travis i would like /none/ to spike the skull  taliesin oh jesus  matt okay go ahead and make a strength check  laura youre just going to  travis what are the fucking chances  matt a natural one  laura yes  laughter  matt as you reach up at the apex of your throw you look down and  travis i dont believe it i dont fucking believe it  matt your eyes catch pike and during that brief moment of slowmotion as you reach up you see her  face this look of complete heartbreaking disappointment just like that it /none/ shakes you in a  way that you didnt expect and as you go through the motion you already anticipated and your  brains already wandered in doing so you slam it halfheartedly and it bounces and skids across the  ground over by where keyleth is  marisha is it rolling at my feet  laura i run and jump for it  matt all right so its not your turn its the end of your turn as it goes rolling you run and  dodge go ahead and make an acrobatics check  liam damn it  laura /none/ 23  matt 23 all right you jump out of the way tumble roll and scoop up it in your arms once  more and you have it  marisha can i get a spell off  matt you have to get to your turn is that all youre going to do  laura that was all of it can i run out of the room if i can move im going to run towards the door  matt id say yeah with the tumble and everything you have just enough movement to get  out of the room so /none/ vex goes darting out of the workshop just past the door leaving the room  that brings us now to  liam relay race okay then i take a step in front of her and pull out my daggers and stand in  front of my sister  matt okay  marisha what the fuck is happening seeing all of this happen i cast hold person  travis stop trying to protect the skull  marisha at 4thlevel  matt to against  marisha against percy grog  laura im out of the room you cant see me  liam /none/ im in  marisha how far away are they can i turn around and see  matt id say she just got out of the room you would have visual on her as shes leaving the  room yeah  marisha what about vax  matt yeah vax is standing in front of her you have visual on both technically  travis dont do this  liam this is so metal  marisha vex vex sorry vex  matt all right i need a wisdom saving throw from all three of you  liam wait me too  laura no /none/ just me yeah you fucks are still mobile  travis natural 20  matt boom percy  taliesin 15  matt 15 thats a failure  laura 21  matt so percy your muscles tense up and as youre holding your poker you find yourself  unable to move grog you feel and look over and see keyleth as she looks towards you with intensity  and you feel a similar tremor across your head but you shrug it off  travis these fucking sensations today  matt yeah its weird vex you as well you glance over your shoulder /none/ as you hear keyleth  muttering under her breath and you can feel that familiar sensation of the magical attempt to grasp  your mind your halfelven self makes it even easier to shrug off and you continue darting  forth the direction you are with your brother behind you so youre protecting her  liam oh yes im barring the way  laura so were right up the hallway from our prison cell right  matt correct i havent got to your turn yet though so does that end your turn do you want  to move  marisha /none/ can i say something  matt if you want to yeah  marisha everyone stop why are we fighting we just watched our city burn to the ground what are  we fighting over  travis were not fighting theyre trying to protect the skull  marisha what does this look like what does this look like to you  travis a statue garden  marisha everyone get in percys workshop and were going to talk this out  matt pike its your turn  laura keyleth you dont know whats happening  marisha i would if any of my /none/ fucking party would for once tell me something you all didnt tell me  the full fucking story when we went back into general kriegs house and now look what happened  look what happened because you assholes arent communicating  taliesin muffled mumbling  marisha shut up percy  laughter  matt pike its your turn  marisha this is because of us and you all know it is lets figure this out go pike  laughter  ashley grog did you just say you want to protect the skull  travis no i want to break the skull /dung/ i want to get rid of the dragons  ashley okay what were you trying to do when you brought percy and vex up here  liam vax  travis it needed someone with a dark touch but now its  ashley to do what  travis to get the wish but now its touching everyone theyre trying to protect the skull and  we dont want that we want it broken i think  ashley but you want the wish  travis yeah we want the wish we can do whatever we want to with the wish and not /none/ take it but yeah  ashley there has to be some type of payment if we take a wish  travis well it didnt say anything about a payment there are four dragons killing  everything  matt at this point as you guys are having this conversation and you guys are darting out vex  you stop as coming down the stairs from the main floor is erwen frazzled but still put together  as well as he can  laura i tuck it behind my back  matt im sorry lady vexahlia it appears you have a few /none/ guests suddenly  laura what what kind of guests  matt shes been here before i dont recognize the other in the dining area  laura what does she look like  matt blonde hair  travis allura  matt dwarven individual  marisha oh my god its allura and kima  liam this is a little like clue the movie  laura it kind of is yes erwen bring them down here its an emergency  matt very well ill  laura as quickly as possible  matt yes yes and he turns around and hustles up the stairs /none/  marisha can we all please go back in percys workshop  laura not yet darling  marisha why not  liam keyleth lets just wait until allura gets here i feel like she might have a calming effect  on this situation an outside eye  marisha we are standing in the damn hall all i am asking is that we move into a quiet room  matt at this point now at the top of the stairway two individuals come walking down first  and foremost you see a dwarven male with short black hair and a beard /none/ trimmed fairly fine red  leathers carrying some sort of crooked wand on the side behind him you see hair tossed back as  she rushes down after him arcanist allura vysoren  liam i sheath my daggers  matt okay she looks about curiously and the dwarf goes okay what have we stepped into here  and allura puts her hand on his shoulder and goes dont worry i apologize for my  intrusion i had a is everything all right  laura we could use your help at this moment  matt certainly sorry this is a longtime /dung/ friend of mine elementalist drake thunderbrand  if you dont mind him accompanying us as well  laura is he good  matt oh hes one of the finest  laura a good person  matt ive put my life in his hands a number of times yes  liam things are a lot more complicated than you can even imagine please come in we need you  matt yes yes and as you guys are having this standoff you watch as this blackhaired  redleathered dwarf walks in looking around and inspecting intently you dont recognize him  youve /none/ never seen him before  travis whats he wielding  matt no weapons on him you see him clutching this gnarled curved wand that almost spirals  like a piece of welltreated but messed up wood  travis a stick  laura thats a weapon  matt maybe and allura rushes in muttering under her breath i was just in whitestone and i had a  terrible feeling come over me and all my teleportation sigils within the city were suddenly  severed both my tower and the lyceum i had to manually teleport us here as it was the /none/ only place  i really had enough familiarity with far enough away from the city in case something bad had  happened i hope you dont mind  laura not at all were grateful for your help  liam could you do us a favor we had a small accident with percival  laura not yet not yet  travis does she know about the d  liam no so emon is in ruins its been destroyed by dragons  laura four ancient dragons  marisha they call themselves the chroma conclave  liam and your tower is  travis /none/ fucked  laura were sorry  marisha ill go ahead and drop the hold person on percy  matt and her face goes white the blood runs from her entire complexion and you can see the dwarf  that initially was huffed up and intense in his energy while not fully understanding whats going  on looks over to allura and softens and walks up and puts his hand on her shoulder you okay lass  liam im sorry my lady did you know that uriel planned to step down  matt he threatened it  liam he did it /none/  matt  for weeks what  liam he did it and moments later four old dragons descended upon the city  marisha the cloudtop district has been demolished  matt this cannot be  marisha we dont know who all is alive or dead we can only expect the worst  matt this cannot be  laura unfortunately allura all of that is the reason for our current impasse we seem to have  discovered something that could potentially reverse the situation but theres a great price  to pay it could be a small price to pay we /none/ dont know if you wouldnt mind taking a look at this  relic that we discovered  matt and you see she is still lost in thought and theres something in her mind thats  distracting her immensely but she eventually clarifies and her eyes focus on you once more and  she goes of course please  laura i dont give it to her but i pull the tapestry off of the skull and show it to her  matt she looks at it and leans forward and begins muttering something beneath her breath and she  goes into /none/ technical mode like she distracts herself with work at this moment and as her brow  furrows she mutters under her breath and completes some sort of flash of arcane energy and  you can see the flash of energy attaches around the skull for a second and glints back at her and  she goes right all right thats that skull is not human that skull is githyanki that is a  species that exists primarily on the astral plane theyre rowdy evil pirating marauding  individuals and thats one sense the gem within that skull appears to be /none/ a soul gem and contains  the soul of from what i can gather a githyanki individual very old i can say at least from my  knowledge and learned opinion that no good can come from such an artifact  laura okay he can grant a wish he says lying truth what do you think  matt its hard to say it would take a very powerful individual to do so however i would say  that wishes granted by entities that do not correspond with your moral outlook for the most  part rarely end up in your /none/ favor even when carefully worded  laura right no but i remember this we dealt with this with the demon that killed pike  marisha yes but we used our wish to wish ourselves out of that contract  laura and it had to be so carefully worded  marisha we can destroy more if were not careful  matt there have been powerful individuals who upon obtaining the ability to make such a wish  even as careful as they were they reached beyond the means of its magic and doing so undid  themselves its a very very /none/ powerful very dangerous magic and if this entity is indeed  even capable of doing so whos to say the chances that it wouldnt wreak more havoc than you  intended  liam we are in a precarious position the city is in ruins already in a matter of hours  matt yes yes  marisha what do we do  matt and at this point she looks around for a chair you can see her hands are shaking and she goes  and grabs a chair and pulls it up and sits down for a second puts her hands /none/ on her knees and  quietly describe to me these dragons  marisha there was one of each color  laura a green a black a white  travis and a big red piece of shit  marisha all colors except for blue of the chromatic spectrum i got a few of their names  matt as you go through each color she nods but when you say the big red her body freezes  marisha does this sound familiar to you  matt the names you said  marisha theres a white dragon that called himself vorugal a green /none/ dragon raishan black  dragon umbrasyl and the red dragon we havent heard his name yet he seems to be the leader  matt at this point she nods and goes i know not the middle two but vorugal has been known to  wander the wastes north in othanzia some of the offspring have wandered further in fact i believe  the skysunder that you destroyed naught but two years ago that was sealed in the frostweald was one  of its brethren its children but vorugal has not been seen wandering this far out chromatics do  not /none/ work together they are selfish and greedy and territorial  laura theyre definitely working together  matt this red you say is the leader  liam yes most definitely  marisha he had a message that he belted over the entire city he said that we who live hes  showing mercy and that we can either fight or flee and then  laura he said if we fight or flee well be denied the mercy  marisha okay something along those lines and then he said that it was the guardians of this  city that brought this upon /none/ emon and that he has control he called it like a new order  laura he said our new purpose is to serve him  matt now for the first time you have known allura for quite some time shes been a very  stoic strong confident and powerful person at this moment she has withered she looks genuinely  like shes hit a level of fear you have never seen in an individual like this and it shakes you to  see this upon her face and she puts her hand up and says this is not your fault /dung/ this burden is mine  and looks over to the dwarf and says it is ours and the dwarf you can now see hes  nodding in understanding this dragon its been called many names but the one that its  taken is thordak the cinder king  marisha thordak  matt thordak this terrible beast lorded over half of marquet for centuries taking the scalding  sands as its domain and its denizens as cattle and just as the city of ankharel was becoming the  jewel of the desert thordak struck a battle however that it was unable /none/ to win sent away  mortally wounded it was thought that the dragon had died soon after having not been seen for many  centuries since that is until about 15 years ago the rumors of a powerful drake storming the  beaches and seas had been whispered for a long time while ships would be lost at sea it had  survived and secretly ruled the island of viscan in the south of the lucidian ocean i suppose  after generations the dragon now selfcrowned as the cinder king grew greedier with the islands  limited resources and began /none/ razing the mournset countryside south of the verdant expanse and the  stormcrest mountains and her eyes get even more distant as she is recalling all this reports of  a dragon more massive than the records can compare hit taldorei at the time i wasnt part of the  council i traveled with a group of adventurers much like yourselves kima drake here and a  handful of other brave souls who are no longer with us we traveled to investigate but arrived  to find this creature destroying everything surrounding the glade pools port udall gone  byroden /none/ a smoldering ruin and we gathered a small army of mercenaries and hunted it back to its new  den in the stormcrest where a large number of lizardfolk had formed around him but we were  overpowered by the sheer might of the dragon many lives were lost knowing that we could not kill  it we turned to other means i called upon the arcana pansophical a circle of friends arcane  practitioners that agreed to work together across the land to keep them safe they devised a trap  one that could we believed permanently seal thordak /none/ within the elemental plane of fire  preventing him from ever returning to our world at the sacrifice of many including our  companions sirus dohla ghenn we succeeded and as the tears begin to roll down her face she  looks around for naught now it seems and somehow he has broken our invocation we bound his  essence to the fountains of creation and thought he would stay there forever and she goes quiet  and looks around for a second im sorry  taliesin this couldnt be because of our journey to the elemental plane could it /none/  matt im so sorry  taliesin we saw him there  marisha we did but it sounds like he has been  taliesin we didnt set him free you dont think  travis no it was keyleths ashari thing  marisha my people our job is to guard these realms  taliesin is there any way of contacting the fire ashari  marisha yeah yeah oh god oh god what if theyre what if theyre dead  matt to bind him we created an artifact called a soul anchor it was crafted from the salvaged  heart crystal of /dung/ a primordial fire titan the anchor could not be removed from the plane and  the cinder king could not leave without it i dont know how hes managed to escaped the binding  of this  marisha oh my god this is all my fault  taliesin no no this was a land mine waiting to be stepped on  marisha but wait we fought we fought my elders we fought the headmaster  laura it couldnt have been  matt that would have no bearing on this the heart crystal is immense 15 20 feet in diameter  /none/ its a gem of pure crystallized ruby and elemental power and energy lest you managed to find this  and destroy it which i mean no offence is far beyond your capability  marisha my people would they be okay  matt depends on where he made his way through the timing is rather conspicuous seeing as how  winters crest recently passed in which time the planes are the thinnest barricades  marisha yeah  matt whatever it is i fear that our ruse will not work twice especially if thordak has had all  this time to obsess /none/ over his failure i do not know our next course of action  marisha what do you know of general krieg  matt hes been gone for some time  marisha you were on the council with him do you know anything further  matt i think it was discussed that he had been killed during the demonic intrusion in the city  or deserted  laura would a dragon seek vengeance against one of their brethren killed  matt chromatics are selfish beings they do not care for each other and the power of one is  enough but /none/ a conclave of dragons is both extraordinary and horrifying but there is no  there is no sense of vengeance for their kin unless it is against the greater plan now if  what you say is true and these other dragons are bound together in the service of thordak i  imagine they would be the ones who had the power and the resources to find some way to bring him through  laura all right  matt at which point the dwarf steps up and still has his hand rubbing alluras shoulder and says  we knew not /none/ what we were doing other than trying to save it dont blame yourself  marisha allura  matt yes  marisha would you consider us guardians of this city  matt one of many i believe the guardians  marisha is this because of us  matt allura looks at you deadon and says the only guardians that thordak would know of would be  the ones that sent him away to that plane 15 years ago this is my fault  liam thats not true if we are to solve this situation we cannot hide the truth i killed /none/  krieg we killed krieg i finished krieg  laura krieg was a dragon allura  marisha a blue dragon  liam we stumbled upon his lair reached through his home in emon through magical means we found  his lair  laura he attacked us  liam and we i  marisha i reach out and i grab vaxs hand  taliesin we survived  liam when it happened he had four stones four orbs in his lair they saw us  marisha they spoke out to us  taliesin they threatened us  matt when was this was /none/ this  taliesin many years ago  marisha maybe two years ago  liam not all that long ago  laura it was right after we got to emon  matt its been over a year at least well if its taken them that long at least to free thordak it  means that this was probably in the works for quite some time if we do share this responsibility i  assure you it weighs heavier on me than it does you but right now we need all the allies we can  gather now you say thordak is /none/ where right now  travis sitting on emon  matt within the city  laura yeah  taliesin vex you would know  laura oh i can sense them right  matt its for a sixmile radius was it  laura yeah  matt on the edge of your senses you close your eyes and focus and extend your ability to feel the  landscape around you indeed the cinder king still sits in the center of the city  laura hes here  matt what of the others  laura do i sense any others  matt nope  /none/ laura theyre gone for the time being  travis its weird they do what he says  taliesin barely  liam and on top of all that we have this fucking skull  marisha i need to check in with my people i need to check in with the air ashari  matt wheres the rest wheres the council who do we know survived  laura we dont know anything everyone was dying around us we made it to the keep  travis it happened very quickly  liam we dont know what happened to uriel we didnt see  /none/ matt we need to take stock of who we can consider friends that are still around we need  all allies right now that should be our first order of business if anything and her face  drops again i just lost my connection with westruun  travis oh fuck the whole world  marisha yeah this is an annihilation  matt this isnt an annihilation if this was an extermination there wouldnt be any survivors you  wouldnt be here the fact that theyve only taken what they can of the city what use is a city  to /none/ a dragon if it doesnt have worshippers theyre vain beings  marisha think allura what do all these cities have in common and what would be the benefits of  taking over these cities  matt resources their gold their people  marisha do you think they just want domination over people over us they called us ants  matt yes  laura they want to be gods  matt what good is a creature that sees itself as superior if there arent those around it to tell  them as such and confirm the belief and if anyone refuses /none/ to bend to their will through fear and  power that is the nature of the chromatic dragons  marisha there has to be something more that they want  matt perhaps but for now the fact that hes even shouted mercy at this time as opposed to  completely destroying everything in his wake means that vanity can be used to our advantage i  dont know how soon but thats something now  travis allies vasselheim has warriors armories  taliesin whitestone as well  laura we can bring them here  marisha i need to reach out /none/ to the ashari and see if theyre i leave i want to go well  actually allura will you help me in a scrying spell  matt yes yes the best i can yes  marisha i want to scry and first check in on the fire ashari  matt okay all right at this point she pulls out her crystal ball from a little tiny satchel which  is in itself a smaller bag of holding pulls out a small mirror takes some water and pours it on the  mirror places the sphere above it and it floats /none/ for a second and theres a makeshift scrying  ritual site here before you you guys take about ten minutes to concentrate and if you guys want  to do anything in that tenminute period youre welcome to or if you just want to watch and wait  you can  taliesin im going to just sit its been a long long day  matt okay the spell completes  travis can i roll hit dice  matt yeah you guys can begin to take a short rest if you want to heal up  liam i go over to /none/ my sister in that time i want i want to kill that dragon or i want to  die trying  laura we will  marisha do i see cerkonos  matt so you take alluras hand and you put your focus into the crystal sphere your vision lifts  out of the keep with extreme speed you find your visual surroundings thrust across the ozmit sea  you find yourself swooping across the shores of othanzia over the forests eventually coming upon  the blackened clouds that perpetually hang above the charred mountain range that contains the home  /none/ of the fire ashari and the entrance to the elemental plane of fire your vision crests the  mountain and steps into the valley of broken blackened shale to the everburning forest as you  come upon it you recall where the fire ashari village was and where you were greeted before and  given your trials where there is now nothing but sundered broken wood tents destroyed bodies  burned and charred and curled up in horrible evergasping pain the forest itself is flattened  from the inside out like a blast from the center of it just exploded /none/ outward the trees all bent  and snapped at the base and in the center where there once was that small pool of molten lava that  you created the portal through and stepped into the elemental plane there is a large ominous  flickering gash between the planes that is roughly 30 to 40 feet in width and height that is pulsing  as fire and magma pours out of it you can see wandering imps and elementals and various entities  slowly peeking out and escaping and wandering throughout the mountain tops from what you can  see /none/ there are no signs of any survivors  marisha it destroyed everything they killed everyone  matt allura at this point who pulls out of the ritual reaches out and grabs you by the  shoulders  marisha we failed  matt and she looks you in the eyes and for a moment you feel like her normally warm and  embracing face has gone cold and intense and her voice seems to echo with an undercurrent of arcane  focus and volume she goes  marisha my people failed we failed our cause  matt keyleth you failed no /none/ one this is not your doing this burden is ours as a people to  hold do not let this wash over you or he wins this is their making this is not yours these  creatures are evil incarnate and it is our job our true calling to end what they have done do  not let this crush you you are stronger than that pull yourself together your people those  that remain they stand behind you  marisha im not as strong as you allura  matt but you can be and you will be do you /dung/ trust me do you trust me  marisha yes  matt good her grasp releases  marisha thats my people  matt and mine and all of ours there are many secrets in these lands im a firm believer that  theres always a way to victory if we are smart about it and if were quick about it now i think  we should look for survivors gather those we know that can rally to our cause in emon and beyond  what say you  taliesin aye  travis yeah  marisha aye  liam we are to /none/ stand now or we might as well be dead  laura so were definitely not going to wish on this skull then yeah  matt i would recommend against it  marisha yeah i stand  matt very well let us prepare for the fall of the chroma conclave together  and thats where well end our session for tonight  laura fucking a  matt hey guys dds fun  laughter  marisha dd will never be fun again everythings ruined  liam hey were all cows  laughter  marisha back when things were so much simpler  /none/ liam be sure to buy a tshirt over on geekandsundrycom  travis wow  liam in sams honor  laura what in the hell  taliesin brought to you by wyrmwood gaming specifically designed to absorb tears  laughter  marisha ah yes thank you its so porous  matt so yeah  ashley can we play longer  travis can we play longer  matt aww  marisha what time is it its ten oclock and we ended on time and  laura thats the first time weve ever ended on time  liam wow that game felt like /none/ 20 hours  travis yeah originally this was supposed to be a threehour show but it never quite made it that way  matt i know we tried we try and mostly fail but occasionally we get it right so i mean id say  im sorry for the emotional rollercoaster but no  travis the was fucking awesomethat was awesome aside from the death  taliesin i would have kicked your ass by the way just throwing that out there i picked up the  poker because i didnt want to hurt you  laughter  travis all right /none/ okay  taliesin throwing that out there  liam my plan was to take that skull and run like a fucking football player and fucking go for the goal  taliesin flash gordon  liam yeah i would have been in the heart of emon shoving it up the red dragons nose  matt well welcome to the new story arc  laura oh jeez  cheering  laura everything changed  matt yeah oh man  laura everything  taliesin when do i level up  marisha im going to find a corner to rock back and forth in /dung/  liam we would have been working in a lichs sugar mine if youd done that  travis nah we all would have been kings and queens we would be drinking iced mochas  marisha i was more afraid of us wishing ourselves out of existence i wish there were no more  dragons and no more people and no more  taliesin it was such a bad deal i said no like can you imagine how bad of a deal that must  have been  liam thats a good point  taliesin i was really looking for a /none/ reason to say yes  marisha and it turns out that it was just a fucking lameass pirate fuck that we dont want  to be indebted to some shithead pirate  taliesin nothing good happens when you let mxyzptlk out of the goddamn skull  matt it was fun i set a time for myself when shes gonna arrive and i was like oh man  whats going to happen before she gets there i was like as you guys kept delaying it they might  actually she might actually catch them in time  marisha she would have /dung/ walked in and were beating the shit out of each other  laura it all would have gone to hell if  matt you dont know what would happen you dont know  travis i would have saved the world thats what would have happened fucking one  matt none of you have heard of a githyanki in your travels  travis i would have been king grog i would have gotten a cave i would had a bunch of harem people  taking care of me giving me sponge baths with their tongues  liam i was going to /none/ carve my name in your nuts  travis i would object to that  taliesin i was going to gender swap i wanted percy was going to become percina  laughter  marisha i wish i was a woman  marisha we still have the dragon problem but now have the dragon and a pirate  matt there you go the de rolo sisters glad you could make it ashley  cheering  matt you should make it every week  marisha does this mean im the last druid to make the aramente  matt you dont know  taliesin /none/ there might have been one after you  laura theres got to be other ones  matt from what you saw the fire ashari were decimated you saw a number of bodies you dont  know if any escaped you dont if any were hidden you dont know what happened at that location it  is desolation and you get the sense from that that is precisely the place where thordak came  through the plane  marisha im wondering about the other locations though too  taliesin i want to know about whitestone we have a lot a phone /none/ calls to make  marisha we have a lot of phone calls like i  travis theyre all dead everybodys dead  marisha theoretically wiped my people off the face of the planet  matt such an optimist  marisha if they all busted through  taliesin does decimate mean that 110 survived or that only 10 died i can never remember which  one decimated is i know its one of the two  matt yeah that term has been largely misused in the currentday vernacular  taliesin i know  10 died thats what it is  travis /none/ i love misusing vernacular  matt its fun you guys  travis great fucking story matt holy shit holy shit you had trees and stuff  taliesin why do you got to be a dick man  matt as were discovering the white battlemats dont pick up as well on the camera as the colors  im trying to use other options whenever possible  travis it works the green was amazing  laura
