none	 faint music  matt lets see this is not hello everyone i dont know if it went onto twitter or not and im  glad you guys could join i got a haircut as im sure some of you see it was absolutely necessary  because it got way too long out of laziness and id like to cut it more often than i had and itd  become just a mane of ridiculousness at least here itll have a chance to grow its not that  far from the length i had when the show first started so its 
none	 not completely out of the blue i  dont think im also a pacer as i talk so i apologize if you keep seeing the background shift  sorry about that marisha and marishas dad are here as well and weve all been doing work around  the place as we go ill show you a little bit now been getting some work done over here say  hi marisha  marisha hi guys did you show them our new floors  matt no i havent shown them right now  we got new tile floors in here much better

none	 was left over some packages that  either didnt make it in time got caught in the mail or whatever case it may be we have a bunch  more letters and things here were going to open and say thank yous we dont have the full cast  here well be opening them for them and then making little piles for what goes to who so we can  deliver them to them next time we see them hopefully this thursday possibly more minis i  dont know im waiting on marisha to get out of the bathroom here

none	 a shower on  when i inaudible  matt are you serious marisha accidentally turned the shower on herself  marisha im a little wet i hate it when that happens hi guys did you show them your  mini organization  matt no i showed them a little bit last time i can show them its grown  a little bit  marisha its getting updated slowly but surely we have so little time  matt for those who are asking whats a good place to get minis aside from your local comic shops and  game stores which 
none	 have the packages if youre looking for specific ones you can go to  miniaturemarketcom troll and toad ebay actually has a good mini selection or you can order the  unopened boxes from amazon as well if theyre in stock hero forge is new material which is a much  higher quality material which is great any tips you have to get your wife into dd show her some  acquisitions inc or critical role or something and see if its something shed be into if she  likes narrative if she likes storytelling or if she likes being 
dung	 random with her friends and having  silly times in a fantasy world then hopefully thatll be just a little push to get on there  tips on painting minis theres plenty of great youtube channels that do stepbystep tutorials on  miniature painting that i highly recommend i dont know any off the top of my head but you can  search painting war miniatures or fantasy miniatures theres a lot of great tutorials but  as an overview you want to make sure you do a dark coat first if you want more muddled colors  do a 
dung	 dark primer or lighter primer if you want brighter colors to come out in the final model  then you just paint the model all the colors you want in different places then you do a wash  which is like an ink wash pass on the model and what it does is it seeps into the nooks and  crannies and giving the appearance of shadow and shading then you do drybrushing you take a  stiff brush usually small and dip lighter colors than what the base coats were fairly brighter but  the same tone then you 
none	 brush it on a paper towel or a small towel on the side until most of the  paint is off the brush just a little bit then you dust the highest ridges of the darker color in  places where it is and it gives the appearance of shine and light sourcing which is kind of fun if  you go on youtube theres a lot of really great indepth tutorials you can find there any  possibility of attending a scottish con you got to get a scottish con to invite us i would love  that scotland 
none	 ive never been to its where my familys background is and i would absolutely  adore the chance to go to scotland so hopefully if you know any cons nearby tell them to invite  us thatd be great anyway heres the mini cabinet it is growing larger and larger and  organization is progressing piece by piece then of course we have thordak over there i have a  problem i have a serious problem what are my thoughts on monks monks are awesome monks are  amazing theyre a great class that i think is underused and i 
town	 think a lot of people have a hard  time finding a way to fit it into a fantasy setting but i dont think its hard at all  especially if you watch conan you find that kind of  and consider back in those time periods  there was that transition between the east and the west europe silk road to china and that whole  circumstance theres a lot of cultural influences you can pull from that transition and that time  period that can be a fun stylistic way to incorporate your monk into a campaign or 
none	 just  consider the different deities and different gods of the pantheon prefer the idea of martial control  and training as a means of purifying ones spirit and soul and so that makes a cool drive for a  character monks are just great in combat theyre fun you can do a lot of unique and interesting  maneuvers and flavor them well if you love any bruce lee or jackie chan films its great lets  see will i be playing the overwatch beta i hope so ill be playing the crap out of overwatch when  it 
dung	 comes in ive just finally started dark souls iii last night havent had time until then and  even then it was midnight to 200 am i was like okay ill make a character and i spent a while  trying to decide what to do i made two i made lady kima and grog strongjaw im actually tearing  through the game as grog right now which is kind of funny i figure its a good way positive  thoughts to your wifes surgery all the positive thoughts crossed hearts thumbs up crossed  fingers all the good stuff 
none	 if wanted to play a dwarf bard what college would i be in oh man i  lend myself to the lore college because i like the expansion of spell use but for the dwarf  bard id probably end up going valor because i like the idea of him being more aggressive and  battleoriented but thats just me dwarf versus elf im probably going to go dwarf elves get a  lot of love in most media i think dwarves are underappreciated a lot of times and theyre one  of my favorite races so dwarf definitely how
