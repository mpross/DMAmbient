statues and the stuff on the walls and the art and  just everything that they work on its no wonder why theyre as successful as they are because of  the attention and the love and the care oh somebody

rogues in all kinds of games i like magic users i dont know i think if vax ever kicks the  bucket and by the way i see a lot some guys are saying that vaxildan or me or both of us  whatever that means has a death wish i dont i hope he never dies i love playing him i think if  he ever does get flattened then ill probably do something magicky but i dont know i did see  star wars and enjoyed it because /none/ it was really well made god im tired liam what would you  hope to accomplish if matt does your backstory like he did percy the twins have a sadsack  story but i dont feel like its a special story theyre just a couple of unwanted kids theyre  not their mothers gone i dont think shes squirrelled away somewhere secretly going to pop  up i think shes gone well see their father is not royalty hes got a good position theyre  just a couple of unwanted kids theyre not princes theyre not royalty they have no /none/ special  future i think ive always liked that theyre just a couple of deadenders you had a blue thing  on your profile could you tell me i lost it its gone lets see any more all work no play  yeah the podcast is not dead it has slowed down when sam and i started that we were really busy  and now were ridiculously busy what let me see dub a dub a dub a i cant stop talking  isnt that deal you have to keep saying stuff we need an adventures in babysitting arc with /none/  your halfsister you have just dated yourself my friend i know what that means but im pretty  sure half the audience doesnt what else vox machinas ages i dont know everybodys ages i  think what laura and i have said for the twins is theyre 27 i dont know that i am popular  someones asking me why im so popular i was passed over in spin the bottle when i was 12 so i  never really felt like the popular kid im just still the same geek ive always been gming for  the kids /none/ is good my son loves it he is totally addicted we dont get to play that much because  it takes a lot of planning i dont know how matt does it for a nuanced complicated way for a bunch  of adults and thousands of people just finding the time to prepare for three nine year olds i  find challenging they love it my daughter romper stomper is starting to sniff around about  it ive started talking to her about the druid that she wants to make named oak my son has a  couple characters but /none/ his main one that he plays is also a druid not my influence thats just  what they both gravitated towards the ongoing campaign that my son does he plays a halfelven  druid and then his two friends are both dragonborns hes got a big bulky red dragonborn  who is played by his red headed friend from school the other one is a bronze dragonborn  rogue weve only played four games plus for my sons birthday we did a big extravaganza blowout  so i guess five games total how do you feel about being a geek /none/ or nerd being cool now its  good because it means we have an easier time whats it been like introducing your kids to nerd  stuff you love lord of the rings especially thats great im rereading the hobbit with my son  at bedtime its our fourth gothrough of the book he asked for it this time obviously i  introduced it to him and i suggested it a second time the third and fourth time he asked for it  what did you voice gollum in ive done gollum in two or three or four games at /none/ this point the  main one being shadow of mordor which came out a couple of years ago i did the voice but i also  did the performance capture for it too i put on the monkey suit with the nubblies all over it  crawled around and bruised my knees up for glory ive been in love with the hobbit since i was i  dont know 12 or 13 really actually the animated film of the hobbit a little bit  contributed to me getting into acting gollum in that is very different than the gollum we /none/ know  from the movies today i started aping and mirroring that gollum which led me to into doing  drama in high school so to get put on the sm√©agol suit was a big deal for me very big deal for me  favorite character to voice i dont have one gollum is one of them ive always loved doing  gaara gaara voice hes easier to do now that hes chilled out liam voice he used to be a  rage monkey but now hes calm i love nightcrawler what else illidan is always fun to  do /none/ lets see i want to stay for another five minutes guy everyones asking me about a blue  thing in my profile i dont know what you guys mean any advice for aspiring voice actors just  study acting guys you can specialize later but you cant make the choice to specialize if youre  not acting in general so find community theaters in your neighborhood or see if your community  college or high school has drama clubs and start doing it then if you feel like you enjoy it or  have a knack for it you can /none/ then figure out where to go from there you basically have to start  lets see dub a dub a i havent done musical theater i love musical theater but i havent  done it since high school its like the olympics for me its people doing things i cant do  irish accent can you give me your best irish accent im not exactly sure what you want me to  say what could i do oh ill tell you a joke how about a joke guys seamus is walking through  fields of ireland with his son declan /none/ he points off into the distance and says declan yeah  da do you see that bridge over there i do da i spent two weeks of me life working on that  bridge i put my blood sweat and tears into it do they call me seamus the bridge builder no  they walk on for a while seamus points out and says declan do you see that church over there  i do da that church took me three months to build i did it meself i put every ounce of blood  and sweat and love and /none/ care into it months declan do they call me seamus the church builder  no but you fuck one fucking goat liam voice jokes over i missed that one favorite  shakespeare play oh thats hard i like hamlet i like julius caesar i like twelfth night a lot  i played juliet in a four man version of romeo and juliet which is one of my favorite roles that  ive ever played id love to do theater ive talked about this before theres not a ton its  harder to make a living just in the theater alone /none/ and i dug around in theater for many years but  once i started having a family and having to buy diapers put food on the table and stuff i  gravitated towards all of this stuff which was vomiting itself at me thats no small potatoes  im very happy about it youre about to graduate from tisch really scared about your future did  it happen to you any advice yes i graduated from tisch so hi dude i dont know nobody  knows what theyre doing no adult no kid no one knows what theyre doing i /town/ dont know how i got  here im one of the few actors people ask me how to get into voice acting i honestly dont  know really all you can do it study to be an actor and look for opportunities move to where  the work is and keep at it good luck though tisch does give you a good education new york  city is a good place to cut your teeth im going to pick i got to hit the road ill pick five  questions and give shorter answers let me see yes my degree /none/ was in acting i went to new york  university tisch school of the arts to study acting foolishly squeezed it all into three years  because i thought i had to get out there started working pretty immediately once i got out so that  was good im just looking for a question to pick humida humida humida come on throw something at  me let me see have you other played rpgs other than dd im going to assume you mean tabletop  because obviously when i have time i play video games im playing fallout now i /none/ have a big game  collection that i dont get to play that much ive been a gamer for 15 years or longer probably  longer yeah because i had atari and all that i assume youre asking me about tabletop so not  since high school when i was in high school i did play advanced dungeons  dragons i played  really i just read i think just read and made characters for rifts which is a big hodgepodge  sci fimagic amalgam someone led me through shadowrun for one game i barely remember it i  did /none/ cyberpunk for one summer my cousin in upstate new york ran a game and i played a lady rock and  roll star my favorite alcoholic beverage is probably irish whiskey when i was in ireland my  favorite thing to get was bushmills whiskey served as a hot toddy and they called it a hot bush which  was just heated whiskey with sugar and a lemon in it and cloves coming in from the rain and the  cold it was the best no no scotch for me occasionally if someone gives it to me i feel  /none/ like im connecting to my irish roots with the whiskey last question im going to read a couple  and go with it let me see here favorite critical role session what was my favorite critical role  session my favorite moments i mean weve been doing it for over a hundred hours oh boy  favorite critical role moments i mean i loved everything that happened with the briarwoods when  i stepped into the shit and getting away and biting it spilling all the beans on the table  because i thought that was probably my only chance /none/ to do it so that was great im a big scanlan  fan so i love highlight is sam letting sam bust me up week after week let me see the  beholder fight was great oh but better than the beholder fight for me was us sneaking in and  taking out the illithid that was pretty great i also loved back in that arc the vote whether or  not to go down into that chasm and winning the vote and vex and keyleth flipping us the birds  and leaving anyway i thought that was a great /none/ moment i get a lot of messages going like oh  suck it you totally ate it there why did you do that you almost died that was the wrong move  that are some of my favorite moments on the show otherwise itd just be an onrails shooter in an  arcade i love when things go wrong i think really my favorite moments are when the shit hits  the fan and we have to figure it out yep all right i hope that was okay i probably wont do  this too much because im busy but /none/ ill do it once in a while so i hope that was fun thanks  for coming guys have a good weekend and i will see you all next week all right signing off if  i can figure out how to sign off how do you turn it off do i just force quit
