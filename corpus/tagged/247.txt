/none/ jazzy music  cheering  matt hi that was hi good to see you guys thank you all for coming and welcome to our panel  about nerdyass discussions  cheering  matt im going to take a seat for a second then ill probably sit at the front of the table  because this seems a little formal to me welcome everyone if you dont know who i am my name is  matthew mercer im a voice actor los angeles california and im a huge nerd ive been playing  dd and other rpgs most of my life /dung/ both video game and tabletop in recent years have had  something weird in my life happen where a lot of other people have gotten invested in my dd game  as much as i am its been incredible i have a show called critical role  cheering  matt me and a bunch of other nerdyass voice actors that are friends of mine began playing at  home privately years ago we were asked to stream it on twitch and now coming up on our third year  anniversary which is crazy  audience member and many more  /none/ matt yeah were not going anywhere i mean cameras or not were still playing for now  everythings pretty kosher we started streaming it and we were very scared to stream it because  when you put anything you love on the internet its a dangerous scary thing especially tabletop  gaming which had been a largely misunderstood genre and hobby for a long time the idea of doing  it so people could just watch it seemed like folly i was like no ones going to this is  just opening us up to everyone telling us how terrible /none/ we are and to go away thankfully i was  very wrong for the most part theres still that factor and i expect that thats fine weve  found this incredible community of people that not just watch our adventures and are invested in our  adventures and do stories and art but go off and create their own which is what i really want  to was use it as a platform to empower other people to create their own adventures to find a  new hobby they didnt know was out there or didnt understand how to get /none/ into or rediscover it  because it had been a long time since they had given themselves permission as an adult to get  back into it then doing so find incredible friend groups and reconnect and find in my  opinion is one of the best uses of your social time with a close group of friends theres really  no experience like playing a tabletop rpg in my opinion its been really amazing and i feel like  a proud papa seeing all these people out there who either got into dd through our show or other  /none/ streaming services got back into it and they tell me about their adventures and their characters  sometimes for a while but thats cool because that was me for a long time theyd be like you  play dd id be like oh yeah let me tell you about my dwarf fighter and they slowly turn to  ash its been incredible these recent years seeing what this panels about the tabletop  renaissance that a lot of people are talking about is seeing what was once a hobby that had  difficulty being understood being respected in a lot /none/ spaces for many of years and suffered through  the satanic panic of the 80s recently thanks to things like stranger things thanks to twitch and  live play introductions that have been going for years even before we started ours now into other  forms of media its not just being proud to say that you play dungeons  dragons but more and  more people are asking ive always wanted to get into that do you know anybody or do you know how  i can learn we have great people like matt colville who are doing youtube /none/ channels about how  easy it is colville how easy it can be to run a game and all aspects of it that i know i was very  scared of as i got older and tried to dive into it now is great time to learn and a great time to  dive into it its super exciting im super excited we had a very emotional end to our last  campaign in october a game that we ran for five years characters that we in many cases lived  and breathed to the point where you guys didnt /none/ see this but before we went live last thursday  travis turns to taliesin across the table and went percy i was and we all slowly turned to  travis and said did you just call him percy thats when we realized that it was probably best that we  ended the last campaign were starting to blur that line a little intensely no end of shit going  forward for that we ended that campaign it was very emotional for the past few months its been  a lot of preparation for the new campaign which we just started /none/  cheering and applause  matt which was a very nerve wracking experience to build for are you  audience yeah  matt are you  cheering and applause  matt see now thats some devil magic right there we have officially from what ive seen in  person the first full cosplay of one of our characters two days after  cheering  matt jester stand up and take a bow  cheering  matt whats your name  ariana ariana  matt ariana amazing job thats awesome  audience member take a picture for laura  matt oh /none/ my god oh yeah actually come up and ill take a picture and send it to her  cheering  matt just because watching laura freak out is amazing as youve seen shes so much fun to mess  with go ahead take a pose for me yay thank you  cheering and applause  matt thats so cool so stuff like this happens now which is crazy to put it into context we  were already pretty nervous going in because when we started streaming originally they were  characters we had already been with for a few years /none/ privately so everyone was very sure of  themselves and their personalities story arcs we just opened it up to the world this was a new  campaign everyone keep this in mind too while weve been playing this for a number of years for  a lot of our party it was their second campaign ever because the first arc vox machina was their  first experience playing a role playing game they were super nervous about it  audience member except for liam  matt except for liam taliesin me and marisha everyone ill switch over to this /none/ one were  sitting down at the table and getting ready to go live everyones getting jittery and theyre  nervous going oh my god i hope its okay travis goes and checks the numbers two minutes  before we go live and hes like theres 70000 people on twitch were like what he goes  i think its broken reloads it oh now its 80 all of us turn pale im curious to go back  and watch our faces on the vod to see how all of us are just hi the total numbers came in  between /none/ the platforms we were streaming to twitch youtube live and alpha and i think  between them all we hit 125000 people watching live  applause  matt watching us play dungeons  dragons as many of you out there who grew up in the same era i  did back when this thing was very taboo it wasnt an understood thing thats crazy thats  nuts its magical its perpetually magical were so appreciative of all of you yeah we  dont know whats happening we have no idea were just holding on by the seat of our pants /none/ and  hoping we dont mess it up thank you guys for being so supportive thank you guys for being so  awesome and as excited as we are then taking this example of what were hoping to be an example of  goodwill and sharing it with everyone else and being a continuation and an extension of that  seriously really appreciate it give yourselves a round of applause for that  applause  matt its been a huge part of my life i owe a lot of who i am as a person i owe a lot of /none/ my  career and my skills socially to growing up playing role playing games its a space where you  can therapeutically work through issues in your life through a character thats other than you  its a place where you can find empathy for personalities and people and different walks of  life and in different situations than those youre in  matt its a place to express frustration and anger in a safe area sometimes against monsters  and terrors and great evil bad beings that can be a representation of the things in life that have  /none/ you hurting it becomes a really great place for you to learn empathy to learn expression to  learn to be open and be sometimes sensitive with friends through the comforting veil of another  character its allowed me to learn a lot about myself how to be a friend and its led to many  of my standing friendships throughout my whole life i owe a lot to roleplaying games dd  specifically that being the case and having the chance to do panels like this and meet guys like  you and hear your stories thats nutrition to /none/ me it keeps me alive it really excites me marisha  can say its exhausting in a weird way how overwhelming the positivity is and its  absolutely wonderful its so much bigger than us were a show were a group were a game group of  friends but the community the critters what you guys put out there it eclipses anything and  everything we do even if we may be the core of that community you guys continue to be what makes  all this worth it more not trying to get too emotional its a lot of /none/ reflection especially  with last weeks first campaign conversation ive talked a lot at you for the beginning of this  panel so id love to talk with you and have questions to ask ideas and stuff we have a  microphone here at the front if you have something you want to discuss bring it up to the  front here and get in line try and keep it somewhat concise and not too many layered  questions because i want to try and talk with as many of you as possible we probably wont be able  to /none/ get through everybody but im going to try and please move at a respectable speed  chuckling  audience member thank you matt  matt no worries all right  audience member matt what time did your flight get in on friday  matt my flight left at 8am friday morning i had to wake up at 5am and after the nerves the  jitters of that first campaign on thursday i didnt get to sleep until about 3am so i got two  hours of sleep woke up went to the airport got another hour and a half on /none/ the plane because you  know plane and then went right to my signing yesterday i might seem a little frazzled over the  past 24 hours i apologize but theres a good reason yeah fair enough sorry hi  audience member hi hello again  matt hello again whats your question  audience member we had similar conversations when i could get ahold of you about with the  campaigns that im currently in that i was considering starting to stream them or record them  or novelize them or something because i didnt get that idea until after /tavern/ the first session which  is basically the session zero where they had who everyone is meeting in the tavern that sort of  thing are you still able to start something akin to critical role where you record for the games  even if you miss the very first session because the first session has all of the backstory stuff  so far  matt yeah most stories whether it be film television novel the first chapter isnt you  learning everything about the characters theres a lot of elements of their life thats already  happened and part /none/ of for the reader whats interesting is to fill those gaps like for the  new campaign i did a session zero with all the players before we started streaming it it was a  prelude that was both a space for them to feel comfortable this is a little private thing that  they have for themselves to figure out their character that way when we come into the session  that first episode you already feel like its a livedin world as opposed to everyone awkwardly  going hi im a tiefling theres a little bit of that /none/ too but that happens with any beginning  of the campaign dont feel like you have to frontload all of the exposition or all of the  information all of the backstories up front if anything it makes the world feel more like youre  getting a glimpse at a living space if people continue to act and be without all of the  information available to you its already happened and its still happening dont feel like  that should be constraining to you  audience member and also aside from dd which is the d20 system do you /none/ have any other systems  you like in terms of tabletop games and why  matt this is a whole long discussion and im trying to keep it concise so we can get to the  next question the fate system ive enjoyed a lot of times ive played traveler and diaspora which  are both fun games both hard scifi and weird scifi especially traveler because its one of  the few games where you can die in character creation because you get to choose your  characters path in life what jobs they do and if they go /none/ into more dangerous jobs they learn  better skills to start with but theres a chance that if you have a dangerous job youll get  killed on the job and have to start over its kind of fucked the old school deadlands system  which is phenomenal its a little more complicated its not as streamlined as the newer  one but the idea that casting spells is you playing a card game with devils and demons and  the better hands you get against the dm or the gm of the game whos playing the devils side gets /none/  you different abilities based on the spell you want to do its got a lot of really cool old  western elements theres also the amber diceless roleplaying game when i was in high school based  off the amber series and that was interesting but that takes a lot of trust because without dice  its a lot of you all deciding together what succeeds and what fails that can lead to  arguments i learned very quickly if everyone isnt on the same page and trusts each other at  the table those are a few examples /none/ of what ive enjoyed ive heard good things about the newer  star wars systems havent tried that yet anyway i have to get to the next question but thank you man  organizer real quick guys keep it to one question only if you have a second question go  to the end of the line and then ask your second one  matt hello  audience member hello oh gosh that was loud i just wanted to say that i really look up to you  and your storytelling your descriptions and stuff is amazing i wanted to /none/ know im sorry if this  has been asked before but do you have any tips or advice for anyone writers or bored gms  storytellers in how you come up with such great descriptions and such vivid images of things that  are all in your head  matt for one reading a lot it helps expand your vocabulary theres a lot of words that youll  come across in books and be like i dont know what that means you look it up and be like  thats cool and now i know that word and i can /none/ use it that was huge for me growing up and  continues to be whenever i have time to read a cool way to keep that sharp moving forward also  consider when youre setting a scene its not just visuals consider all the senses consider  ways that you can set a scene with both what theyre seeing what the temperature of the room  is if theres a certain acrid or ironlike taste in the air or if its very cold and causes their  teeth to feel pain when they breathe in is there a specific sound /none/ of distant shaking or perhaps  water dripping off wall condensation think of how the different senses are affected when you set a  scene and that helps immerse your players or whoevers reading your story as you get into it  thats a big topic but from running a game standpoint i find those are good little tricks  whenever you open a new sequence a new location for the players to immediately pull them into the  world and help them imagine exactly where they are that helps the immersion it helps the  players get ready to /none/ dive into it in character thats a really quick tip that i hope will be helpful  audience member thank you  matt no worries thank you  audience member hows it going  matt good howre you doing  audience member good in the new campaign when your players are talking to you about the new characters  matt yes which by the way i do want try and avoid spoilers in case people havent seen the  new episode  audience member and they came to you with their ideas did any of them come to you with /none/ an idea  that made you go ooh hmm no  matt generally no not my players ive had that happen in the past if a player wants to play a  character of a certain kind im not going to tell them not to i might help them finesse it or let  them know in some situations where its going to be difficult based on the world were playing in  or they dont understand issues that might come up for instance if somebody was like i have a  charisma of eight i want to be a /none/ warlock id be like maybe lets try to mix up those stats a  little theres certain concepts that may not be the strongest concept in fact we have a few race  and class combinations in the new campaign that are by no means optimal when you consider  minmaxing character strengths but thats also cool because you get combinations you wouldnt  expect to me its more important to create a character idea then it is to create something  thats optimally powerful if you can do both and thats your game thats fun too but i dont /town/  think that should hinder you necessarily theres never been a concept that ive shot down i can  help players finesse it if theyre unsure or if theyre trying to feel out how this would fit in  the world then ill work with them and well talk over their story and talk about their  abilities and how that might fit for their narrative down the road its rare that i shoot  something down unless the person is a real dick my concept is a person that sets children on  fire im like eh i dont /none/ know if thats going to play well with the rest of the group buddy  audience member lasts one second  matt yeah thank you  audience member hey mercer  matt hi  audience member i have a question what do you think was the worst decision that vox machina ever did  matt ooh personally thats a lot of decisions lets see  audience member goldfish  matt thats a member of vox machina vox machina as a whole oh man to be perfectly honest not  checking for traps at the tomb of the raven queen because /none/ that led to a chain of events that led to  a very sad story  audience member it was really bad  matt yeah but it made for a great narrative not all things have to be positive there are a lot of  things to gain yeah theres always and urge as a gm to be like i want this to end up okay i want  it to be all right a lot of times thats a good thing but some stories are powerful because it  doesnt work out in the most positive light thats realistic /none/ and sometimes thats a very  healing experience to go through that i know it was hard for some people in the game to deal with  eventualities in the narrative and missed opportunities to be vague but overall i think  it made for a more impactful story and memorable one its an example of sometimes you have to let  the narrative guide where its going as opposed to try and shoehorn a happy ending unless your  players are all in a really bad place in the world and youre like uh and everythings okay  because /none/ at the same time you want your players to have a good time  audience member thank you  matt thank you  audience member thats not happening sorry hi i am asking you for advice for both my daughter  and i as a player and gamemaster when you get two people in your group who all of a sudden start  theyre 40 years old but they start acting like 13yearold middle school boys on crack and its  all fun and games until they almost get you killed or as in my daughters case her character  /tavern/ killed on stupid side things how do you rein that back in you dont want to be a killjoy and say  okay no fun no jokes but how do you rein it back in so theyre focusing on the group as a  whole and not dying in a bar fight  matt couple things one if its really hampering the narrative and its preventing a lot of people  from having a good time talk with them about it outside of the game after a session where it gets  particularly bad you can be like hey guys /none/ before we leave or im going to take a moment  here i just want to talk for the sake any time youre at the table you try and find a  balance between being respectful of everyone elses good time and not trying to derail it  constantly before other people want to go for the most part a lot of times because it is a very  free environment people will want to be impulsive and im going to do what i want thats fine to  a certain extent but you do have to be respectful of /none/ everyone else at the table otherwise you  probably wont be invited back to the table youre supposed to play the game as a  collaborative experience even though there can be tension there can be moments where there can be  conflict inside people can be selfish if its in character but if its so much to the point where  nobody else is having fun and thats a problem with the way youre playing the game maybe this  table isnt where you should be playing there are tables that that might work at there might be a /tavern/  bunch of powergamers who are down with the idea of being crazy and weird ive had those games too  and theyre fun but you have to make sure everybodys on the same page talk with them about  it and if they continue to do it or you want to teach them a lesson sometimes make those choices  lead to a very bad not tpk scenario but if theyre getting in serious bar fights all the  time theyre going to get arrested theyre going to get imprisoned theyre going to get  interrogated theyre going to /town/ get branded as a criminal on the shoulder whoever the head of the  guard there is going to take a personal liking to make sure that he makes their life miserable now  theyre a watched individual every town they go into everyone seeing their face grimaces now  its a oh my god theres consequences to your actions thats a way to do it too where you  dont have to kill the character but you can certainly shame them  audience member i like that thank you  matt yeah shame  audience member hey matt nice /none/ to see you again  matt hey buddy good to see you  audience member i work at the local childrens hospital and i want to at some point in the  future introduce dungeons  dragons to the children there but all ive ever done as a dm is  dm for adults do you have any advice for dming for children and how young they should be before  they get into it also is it at all possible to see how victor the black powder merchant is doing  laughter and cheering  matt first part im /none/ going to relay what ive heard from other people ive run a few games for  kids liam has a lot more experience with this sam recently did it patrick rothfuss runs it for  his son one the best thing you can do is keep the math minimal so you can focus on the  narrative if youre teaching kids math thats a different thing but make it so its more of a  storytelling thing the dice roll maybe a modifier here and there but however way you can  simplify the rules im sure theres people online /none/ who have more reduced home rule versions of dd  for kids if you research enough ive seen a few out there its pretty cool second steer away  from focusing on the violent combat aspects of it and focus more on the problem solving like  communal problem solving one thing that patrick rothfuss does for really young kids i find is  not give them a weapon give them some magical items and some tools and it challenges so they  have to think of creative ways to get out of it he gave his son no weapons /dung/ but gave him a rope  that ties itself and then put him in a dungeon area where all he had was his rope he ended up  using it to tie up monsters maybe ask them questions and eventually convince him to help him  out then throw the rope up to climb areas where it was dangerous or use it to wrap around things  he could swing across let them become creative and problem solve without always having to kill  things as adults we can keep a difference but youre not going to teach a bunch /dung/ of kids that  sometimes the best thing to do is slaughter your opponent thats maybe not the best thing to  teach them gauge the group to see if they want high adventure or if they want dark liam was  surprised when his daughter and all of her female friends wanted to play and hes like what do  you want to play and they all went curse of strahd and he was like okay the more he ran  it the more that they were craving some good scary horror and so he felt it out you /none/ feel out  the group at first you play it soft and see what theyre interested in and then gear it more  towards their style but simplify it focus on the story and narrative problem solving and  challenges i think are generally more interesting than always having combat although combat can be  fun depending on how old the group is and be conscientious about it those are a few the  opposite side i dont want to confirm anything because i like to see anybody elses  interpretation my personal mind and im not saying this is /none/ canon because i dont want to kill  anybody elses idea i like to imagine in that final battle one of the loud explosions that you  heard in vasselheim was him lining the entirety of his shop all of his explosives with a torch in  his hand as victor theyll never take me alive and a bunch of cultists come in right for  him and in that final moment as he lures them all in he took them all out with him thats how i  like to imagine it  applause  audience member matt when /none/ will elder scrolls exandria happen and will wildemount be dlc for it  matt i mean talk to your local bethesda that would be crazy pretty cool id love that heck  yeah id love that its crazy to me that theres even a book thats out there and its something i  made up thats crazy to me so that i cant even if i think too hard im going to bleed from  my nose ugh aneurysm i hope so hello  audience member hi my husband and i both dm but i think the thing we struggle /dung/ with most is having  memorable characters and thats something that you are absolutely wellknown for what is your  advice on coming up with characters that people will remember their names four weeks later that  kind of a thing  matt right for one thing depending on how you create your character whether it be  randomrolling for take a low statistic somewhere interesting in your character whether  it be super low strength theyre super weak and have a hard time getting around if you want to be  real hardcore dark soulslevel go a super low /none/ constitution and be super one thing about a  unique character is a serious flaw or a number of serious flaws that makes them human it makes them  easy to connect with that doesnt necessarily have to reflect in their statistics but in the  5th edition rules they do a good job of introducing players to bonds and flaws and  personality traits and its a really good introduction to that play up the character you  create what are their longterm goals i think is an important thing so they know at least what  theyre eventually /none/ driving towards whats their shortterm goal what is it theyre trying to  accomplish right now and the use of having this other party how are they intending to make this  group of new friends help them get to that goal consider the things that they really dont like  and try to avoid is it confrontation with family is it a specific type of creature that they had a  bad experience with that theyre always looking over their shoulder for like a bogeymantype of  thing is it they have a fear of public speaking is it /none/ an issue with law enforcement theyre like  ive dealt with the man which will always get them in trouble which is fun too find certain  things that you can write down and stick to that may get your party in trouble because honestly  some of the best experiences are getting your party in trouble try and find common ground  between the characters conflict is good and thats why a lot of my campaigns ill talk to the  players and ask them if any of you have previous relationships what are they as opposed to having /none/  the awkward we all meet at a table and dont know each other and introduce ourselves like an aa  meeting and now were fighting adventuring i find if you have a little bit of back history that  you develop together you already come in feeling stronger connection with those characters and  that strong connection between the two of you has the other players wanting to engage more with that  because they want oh i want that theres no real trick to it more consider the whole spectrum  of good things about them bad things /none/ about them wants goals fears and write them down it wont  be perfect at first its a messy process figuring out your character to be fair all of us  at the end of the first episode of the new campaign were like okay then that was better  than expected we were all waiting for it to fall apart and even then after were getting phone  calls from the players like okay i think im getting an idea now so its a process those  hopefully might help a little bit could be a long topic  /none/ audience member yeah thank you  matt no worries  audience member hi matt im a newer fan and im new to tabletop games  matt welcome  audience member and i notice that you recognize this exceptional cosplay  matt yes  audience member theres several cosplays in the room and this being the critical role panel if  possible before the end of the panel could we get everybody get a photo with you so we have all  the cosplays together  matt i think thats a glorious plan  audience member all right thank you  /none/ matt gilmore voice glorious plan  applause  matt well get the cosplayers up at the end of the panel for one group photo at the front of the  audience awesome  audience member hi matt  matt hey buddy  audience member as a dm ive thrown my fair share of challenges at my players like the time i  threw a dragon turtle at you all and you turned it into a tortoise  matt thats adorable  audience member it still upsets me anyways i love doing that i love challenging my players in  fun /dung/ creative ways like that but at times it does feel like its an arms race at times because  they really like to murder things what advice would you have for a dm thats struggling to  challenge the players and have them develop personalities and adventures like your characters  that go on for years and years  matt for one thing it is an arms race in a weird way because its you trying to outsmart  multiple other people as a dungeon master thats supervillain territory thats you going these  are my peers that i respect /none/ and love and were all on a very equal playing field as far as  intellect goes  audience member lets murder them  matt yeah and theyre all trying to beat my stuff for one thing its fun when you have a  group that are all we can do a lot of damage youre like oh thats cool that doesnt help  if you fight a lot of creatures that you cant damage you can only defeat them by discovering  these three relics throughout this area and destroy them at this one pillar but while thats  /none/ happening its stalking them the entire time the fear of we cannot touch this thing coming up  with challenges where the creature can only be damaged if you acquire this one npc and have them  within a proximity of it because their backstories are tied but you have to keep them alive as much  as youre also getting ready to damage this thing coming up with abilities that the creatures can  have that can shut down or convert party members to its side nothings better than sinking your  party against itself by the way its /none/ a delightful thing in fact its really frustrating  when grogs berserk ability allows him to ignore charm effects i was like ugh oh man it could  be so much fun just want to tear him apart from the inside you have to think outside of the box  and remember even the creatures in the players handbook if youre like this creature ive put  up against them before or something similar to it and they stomped it you look at it and go  well they stomped it because they have a lot of damage output this /none/ creature they resist a lot of  the abilities that it can put on them or conditions nothings stopping you from  customizing it nothings stopping you from changing it which is great too if you have a  group of players that have been playing for a long time and they already know what creatures can do  nothings better than having them fight something like dont worry guys its resistant to fire  or its vulnerable to fire and they do fireball and its all of a sudden immune theyre like  wait what because suddenly they dont /none/ know where they are they dont know whats going on  the real fear creeps into their eyes dont be afraid to customize monsters consider encounters  that sometimes cannot be won by sheer damage output sometimes rely on conditions as a  difficulty factor if a creature has a radial stun thats going to mess things up real fast  especially if its on a five or sixregeneration thing every few rounds or so all of a sudden  half of the party is stunned that sucks for them  laughter  audience member thank you very much matt /none/ i appreciate it  matt no worries im sorry about your party by the way  audience member its okay i live with them  matt hi  audience member hi love your show not really a dd question more about you and your team you  and travis and everyone did an escape room together  matt oh yeah  audience member that was awesome but i want to know how did you get into that howd that happen  matt weve been a fan of escape rooms anyway me and marisha weve done a few of them they /town/ were  doing a show for alpha at the time called escape where they were asking people to do different  escape rooms and they had one that was a harry potter sorcery theme they were like well get  the critical role people and we were like yeah chris sabat voice of vegeta was in town  and theyre like well get him in hes like i dont know what im doing and were like  great it was a fun escape room they invited us to do and we totally almost got there and lost at  the /none/ very last second which was frustrating that was them asking us to do it from an internal geek   sundry standpoint but they knew we were fans of escape rooms my proposal to marisha actually  was i designed and built an escape room that was lovecraftthemed we were all sneaking me and  taliesin and a bunch of a friends were sneaking off for days at a time i had to record i had  sessions backtoback these days well see you this evening then wed drive down to huntington  beach this friend of ours had a /none/ warehouse and were building flats and getting old furniture and  made an escape room for her escape rooms are a thing were fans of but i think ive built the  only one ill ever build because theyre a pain in the butt  audience member thank you  matt thank you  audience member hi matt  matt hello  audience member i have a question about i dont want to be too spoilery but toward the end of  the last campaign talking about missed opportunities that was one of the more visceral  emotional moments that /none/ ive seen in almost anything  matt i know what youre talking about  audience member whats going through your head both as the dm and as matt his friend when  youre seeing a player go through that kind of emotional reaction both as him and as his character  matt part of that is checking in with the player the player involved we had many discussions  outside of the game about the possible paths the character might take it was very much a one  where do you see the character wanting to go what are the /none/ decisions hed make based on certain  scenarios and are you comfortable with pursuing this regardless of how it turns out making sure  that the player was okay with that because once again you want to make sure theyre having a good  time and you dont want to for the sake of well the dice said completely destroy somebody  whos going through a hard time in their life you have to be conscientious of that check in with  them make sure everythings okay make sure theyre okay with going along with whatever  happens if they /dung/ say no then you can be like okay well maybe well take a break from this  scenario for a little while and come back to it until youre ready or if its a real scenario  you can salvage it and so a part of you is the dungeon master you have to be true to the  narrative but you also have to be respectful of your players there and make sure that theyre  still having a good time and youre not putting them in a place that isnt at the time mentally  healthy for them /none/ its a hard balance but its one that only comes with experience and making  sure that you still respect the people that are giving you the time to be part of your story  audience member thank you  matt thank you  audience member good to know that locking people in a room until they accept a proposal is a good idea  laughter  matt works in a lot of scenarios i find  audience member ive never dmed anything before and im trying to set up a lowmagic 5e campaign  so that completely eliminates a /none/ lot of classes how do i go about fixing any of this  matt you can have a lowmagic campaign and have magic characters just consider that they  understand that having magical abilities is probably very rare and probably very feared if  its a world where theres almost no magic and somebody suddenly throws a fireball anybody in  the vicinitys going to be like chain them up thats a problem consider it can be a very  fugitivetype game where theyre trying to keep their abilities on the dl theyre trying to hide  it from society /none/ you can also consider maybe magic itself is visceral and dangerous you can have an  element where if they roll really low on an attack like wild magicwise and whenever they  cast a spell roll and if it goes really badly they lose control and it might hurt them you can  think of narrative reasons as to why magic is still a dangerous and sparing thing  audience member oh like a spellplague  matt that can work out yeah are we talking spell plague like warcraft like plague  audience member forgotten realms  matt okay /town/ there we go yes that can work well oh blood plague is what i was thinking of old  wow players know what im talking about they were watching the desolation of ironforge you can  tailor classes if you want to you can tell people if you really want no players to be  casters you can have them multiclass down the road if magic becomes more prevalent if theyd be  interested or you can reduce the overall damage of spells if youre keeping combat more tailored  but that gets a little more fiddly with the customization /none/ and if this is your first time  dming i wouldnt recommend messing with it that much  audience member yeah i already created two classes for it  matt okay so youre already down the path  audience member i needed a healing class  matt fair enough but then you consider healing some abilities may not be spells they can be  variations to it for instance maybe theyre an alchemist maybe a fireball is a giant sphere of  some concoction they made and they throw it and it explodes and has the same damage and the /none/ same  radius but its not necessarily magical or a healing spell can be somebody who is a fantastic  field medic and has a bunch of salves and medicinal herbs that they can jam into their  wounds real fast and its a cure wounds spell you can find ways to tailor existing rules take  away the narrative magic aspect of it to a certain extent it might be a little unwieldy in the  higher levels ice storm turn the ac on very high by then maybe theres other ways you can  narratively consider the use /none/ of magic in the world but those are some ways you can go about  it i hope thats helpful  audience member you already addressed my first question earlier in the day so i guess my  question is early on in the first campaign you said make a bear pun an angel loses its wings  how can you look at yourself in the mirror after honey heist  laughter  matt look my wife ran that game many of you in the audience will understand they had no choice  she was amazing it was her first /none/ time ever running an rpg and honey heist is a game designed  for bear puns theres a difference between too many bear puns in a game that isnt honey heist  and being in a honey heist where its practically in the rule set i didnt feel too bad about that  we knew what we were getting into with that  audience member she did an amazing job and in all seriousness i think i can speak for everybody in  this room when i say how important you and your players are to our week every single /none/ week  applause  audience member hey first of all i want to say i really appreciate you and all of you guys being  sensitive about spoilers because i havent gotten that far into critical role  matt thats why i was being careful  audience member yeah second thing is a question and it is as a dm and also as a player how do  you balance planning with your character sheet and stuff or dm obviously versus improv and  offthecuff stuff just think of it when youre there  matt that can change either way /dung/ often part of whats the thrill of the game is preparation  usually gets thrown out the window as a dungeon master when the players make contact with your  plans people always say a plan never survives contact with the enemy same deal when it comes to  running a roleplaying game the balance for me preparationwise is not to prepare too much super  detailed because more often than not you will end up throwing out the hours of work that you did  for this whole thing that never happened the party completely missed instead spend a /none/ little  bit of time with bullet points and basic notes that can give you the general idea of a direction  it can go or a location they can be at that way if it doesnt go to you didnt lose too much time  with it you can always bring it back later if they go to it you have enough written down that  you can quickly make up the rest fill in the gaps and hope that process allows you to loosely  prepare a lot more possibilities and as such be more comfortable as a /dung/ player i mean your job is  to mess with the dungeon master your character sheet is your preparation and then you come to  the table and you see how you can fiddle and ruin their work sighing  audience member i guess then all of the pile of maps you had is not strictly necessarily  matt yeah i know theres a lot of maps that never get seen but at the same time i would  prefer those are all map ideas that i take a picture of or save in case they come up later in /none/  the campaign or the ideas can be reused so they dont all go to waste and i would prefer to  prepare things just in case and have them go away then railroad my players to go i worked so hard  on this map youre going to fight here dang it it comes with the territory i suppose thank you  audience member mr mercer first off thank you for streaming ive never been to a con ive  never played dungeons  dragons  matt oh welcome  audience member i feel like a fangirl laughter its /none/ not me so i was always curious when i got  hooked in the first campaign it was right around the time when percy died i happened to be on  twitch i was watching it yeah spoilers sorry guys now everybodys mad but that night marisha  seemed distraught and pissed and i was always curious what happened after the stream was over  matt whenever anything intense happens in the stream people always make jokes like oh matts  sleeping on the couch tonight  laughter  matt no it might be all of us afterward going and /none/ getting a drink if something really emotional  happens that happens almost every time something really big happens well all go to timmy nolans  which is this little irish pub in burbank not too far from us well all just have a drink long  groan commiserate but theres never any anger or frustration outside that a lot of times its  incharacter and sometimes its just frustration with the scenario but we all respect each other  too much to direct it at each other were lucky enough that we have a longterm friendship and  weve played /dung/ long enough where we dont do that thats not always the case at game tables ive  been in games where people do allow those emotions to bleed to directing it at a person outside of  the game and thats unfortunate and unhealthy but those are things you just talk about  afterward if you notice that happening go to that player go to that dungeon master and be  like hey whats up man lets talk this out how can we go forward and not let this bother each  other again understand this isnt me this is /none/ the character those conversations can happen  thankfully we dont have that problem because weve been through enough together and we all  appreciate and respect each other  audience member okay it just seems like after you guys mentioned that whenever somebody died  you guys all go and get a drink together  matt yeah and we do every time something really crazy happens  audience member thats a lot of drinks  laughter  matt oh man im scared for this new campaign theyre all level two right now oh man oh boy  its so funny /none/ they rolled their characters and liams like i have 12 hit points im like cackling  audience member swarm of rats  matt oh man we had our session zero the first hit lauras character took she went to zero hit  points and i was like oh no little different now isnt it  laughter  audience member theyre basically gods right  matt yeah basically gods its fine its great im sorry  audience member hi so ive known you of voice actor fame before i got into critical role last  thursday was actually my first episode /none/  matt oh welcome to the chaos  applause cheers  audience member so i was wondering if you have ever been tempted to work in or have ever  actually done it before slipped easter eggs of past characters that youve voiced into critical  role or not  matt i would say ive never tried to slip easter eggs outside of the game into it because i want  to keep it very separate the more i bring in pop culture elements like the side jokes and stuff  the more i think it can break immersion i /none/ want to keep it wholly of our own realm but there will be  character voices that ive used in projects that will bleed over into it partially because i like  to voice a lot of characters theres going to be a lot of voices that are similar and a lot of  voices youve already heard thats a little frustrating ill do a character and ill be like  yeah lets have a woodsy kind of farmer type ill do a sort of southern accent like this and  everyones like oh look its adara from pillars im /none/ like no all right thats going  to happen but generally i try to keep it separate  audience member thank you so much  matt thank you all right weve got about ten minutes left so im going to try to get through  questions pretty quickly im probably not going to get through everybody if i miss you im so  sorry were going to try question  audience member hey i just wanted to ask after just finishing the entirety of the first season of  critical role whats your process for creating deeper and more memorable /town/ characters that stick  with the players  matt honestly its hard to force a character to be beloved by the players sometimes for a lot of  npcs you dont expect them to latch on and they do so theres no real  crowd gilmore  matt gilmore is a perfect example i never expected for it to continue that way but im glad  they did because he is an amazing character theres no way to engineer it necessarily but as  long as you flesh out npcs that have a similar dynamic as i said earlier about /dung/ making your  players more threedimensional and having a series of positivenegative things about them you  will comfortably begin to portray them as a dungeon master in a much more realistic way and  that will read better if you involve the npc in a scenario where they either save the party or  tremendously help them out of a jam theyre immediately going to go that guys awesome  were going to go back to that guy or that lady saved our butt and were going to go ahead and  pull her into this next storyline so /none/ thats really helpful or for villains also not every  villain is black and white consider a lot of enemies or villains dont see themselves as the  villain some of the better ones feel like theyre doing it for the right and nobody else  understands or its selfish reasons but for them are good for me bad for many other people  thinking about what makes them a threedimensional villain makes them a very unique and memorable  villain remember some of the best villains get away and come back later especially if theyre  intelligent not everything /none/ stays to die not everything is like im going to stay until im  at zero hit points death groans so theyre like im at half health this is not going well  peace poofs thats frustrating for the party too because then you have the ill get you  audience member thank you  matt no worries  audience member matt how you doing  matt good how you doing  audience member im doing great thank you for being an inspiration to myself and all these  amazing people i can now call critters because they are fantastic /none/ people  cheering  audience member we plan to call every single one of them brother and sister because of this  awesome community thank you i hope that this continues on for as long as possible  matt i hope so too  audience member i dm i run multiple games my thursday is a game and then straight to critical  role because its just all the hype you reinvigorate me after maybe a session didnt do  well or whatever but its just so great so id rather use up my question to tell you thank you /town/ so  much and can you bless my dice  cheering laughter  matt thank you very much good color scheme thats a natural 20 on the first roll  applause hollering  crowd take a picture picture  matt whoo i love when the dice work for the narrative laughs i was waiting for it like  this is going to be a one i know it  audience member hey man so thank you for being the leader for the tabletop renaissance you and  everybody in critical role i was there the very first day that you /dung/ guys streamed the minute you  guys finished i knew wed just changed history forever  matt thank you  audience member and because of the renaissance ive now been growing my own blog and everything  else and now im actually a big part of the dd twitter community  matt thats great  audience member yeah so im actually really everywhere in there now i also commented about  your corruption at the tables laughs  matt glad we finally got to put that out there  audience member i cant believe my dark arcana stuff will need /none/ to come out not like that ill  tag you for that one but i wanted to ask because every dm has their own what kind of dm prep  rituals you go through  matt i have a very specific playlist i listen to when im writing my game its a soundtrack that  is a symphonic version of the chrono trigger soundtrack mixed with symphonic final fantasy vi  soundtrack those games played such a role in my youth in my formative creative years that just  having those running puts me in the mood to write so /none/ ill put that on the music ive also found  that minecraft soundtrack that is now on spotify is actually really good writing music too its  just nice and atmospheric in the background other than that rituals involve making sure that my  place is set i know exactly where everything is behind my dm screen i have my dice box here with  the dice in there i have my folder here i have the preparation sheets of the session here i have  maps to the side i have platforms over here i have a drink here /none/ i have a music setup here i  have an actual specific layout that to me the ritual is placing everything in place before the  game and if im running late i dont have time im gonna flip out and nobody can talk to me  like hey matt can i just like roars no setting it up im scared how i am at those  times in hindsight so the setup ritual is for me definitely a ritual  audience member one last thing i couldnt make it to the line in time could i roll a persuasion /none/  check to just get a quick signature  matt unfortunately if i do it to one it opens up to chaos here and they have to rush me out  here thereafter are you going to be here tomorrow  audience member no i wont i have to fly after  matt well ill see what i can do its a slippery slope a lot of people are also in a  similar situation i want to do as much as i can but it gets to a certain point to where its unwieldy  audience member but thanks /none/  matt thank you buddy  audience member hey matt  matt hey buddy  audience member actually my first question is how do you guys remember three hours of your  script every no im kidding  matt laughs well we spend the whole week rehearsing leading up to it we got like four  days we have dress rehearsal on wednesday its great  audience member yeah so i was going to say i actually started dming because of you guys  completely custom world everything one of the things ive struggled with ive watched dm tips  /none/ and everything how do you keep track im trying to keep the game flowing trying to keep the  narrative going trying to get my players involved and i struggle theyll ask oh whats  this guards name oh his names jim okay great how do you keep track of that if i stop  to write the notes i feel like im slowing the narrative down sometimes how do you keep track of  that stuff during the game  matt when the players are talking especially to each other thats where you write down notes so  when /none/ you think up that guys name is jim all right cool you meet jim you talk about jim and  as soon as theyre like all right where do we go next just be like quiet mutter jim not  necessarily writing in the moment if you feel like you need to stay engaged continue to do so  and the moment they start talking to each other listen and write a note assuming they do it a  lot just be like oh theyre talking cool ah yes its finding the balance of the downtime  when theyre all /none/ focused on you thats when you can go ahead and write your notes  audience member awesome appreciate it  matt no worries  audience member all right im running out of time a voice actor that i think would be really  good to be on critical role and that mary knows steve blum why cant we get him on critical role  matt look you think we havent tried its interesting this has been a unique experience  since we started the show a lot of people are not comfortable streaming their dd game weve asked  a /none/ lot of people one of the frustrating things ive had is weve tried to invite a lot of people  on from different diverse backgrounds and ethnicities because were a bunch of white kids  who play dd  audience member nerdyass voice actors we get it  matt yeah its shitty that in order to bring more diversity into our show id have to fire  friends from our group and i dont want to do that so our guests are an opportunity to bring  more people in but a lot of people ive reached out to about /none/ it are like nah im good its a  little nerdy for me  audience member i hope were not that intimidating to them  matt well no but for some people it is and ive noticed that steve very much hes like i  dont want to do this online but the more that its gone and the more that people have been more  welcoming in the community its been more positive its starting to turn around deborah  ann woll who you know from daredevil and stuff we asked her to be a guest two years ago /none/ and she  said no she said this is a personal thing for me and going on the internet in front of a lot of  people to flame me for this i dont want to do it i completely understand and respect that  since then shes been like its actually fun weve hung out a bit shes really cool so i may  try and bring her in for a guest in this season so well see its starting to change but its  been a challenge to get people to come in because when youre on the /none/ internet youre exposing a lot  of yourself in a space thats improvised and very open and very sensitive and the internet isnt  always kind were trying  audience member thank you  matt no worries thank you i think we have time for one more question im so sorry for those who  didnt make it im so sorry i apologize but i love you all  audience sighing applause  matt look at this amazing man jeffrey  audience member you son of a bitch  laughter  audience member i love you man  matt thats /none/ awesome hi buddy  audience member hi met you earlier today for the autograph session and i said it earlier and i  want to say it again but i didnt start with critical role or you a friend actually  recommended me towards matt colville and i saw his running the game series and that made me see  dming as less difficult scary or so much hard work thats what inspired me to actually start  pursuing dungeons  dragons again to start running the game and then i found you and that  inspired the way that /none/ i want to dm much less murder hobo and stuff like that just  storytelling one thing ive run into that i find difficult and i wanted to ask was of all the  voices that you do and the characters that youve made how would one get into voice acting to make  those voices to make these characters feel so much more unique and their own with the voices  that you do  matt basically how to develop voices for the game  audience member yes  matt practice whenever im in the shower whenever im driving /none/ my car whenever im by myself for the  most part occasionally when marishas around ill be improvising doing impressions or trying  to come up with weird voices and dialects i talk to myself a lot thats a good place to figure  things out if you come up with an interesting voice that youve never done before you can pull  up your phone and record yourself and you can listen to it later to replicate it the more you  practice these different voices the more comfortable you are pulling them out at the drop  of /none/ a hat also when you write down npcs or youre creating characters for your campaign taking  notes of what kind of voice it is is a really good reference point whenever you have to go back to  the character you could write low gravelly or highpitched and reedy or cockney accent or  really terrible russian accent things that when you glance at the npc sheet you already have a  ballpark idea of where they were before then you can jump into it it comes with experience it  comes with listening and repeating and trying to /none/ copy other voices out there even if you dont  become a good impressionist in the process of trying it youll find your own unique voices  different things you didnt know you could do beforehand recording yourself listening to it  practicing and dont be afraid to try them out in the middle of the campaign even if your friends  give you shit for it theyre your friends itll be fine  applause  audience member i just want to say youre an inspiration to us all thank you for the advice  matt you guys are an /none/ inspiration to me  mic runner ladies and gentlemen boys and girls of all ages lets give it up to matt mercer  thats our time for today  matt thank you  mic runner at this time i
