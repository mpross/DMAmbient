none	  growling screaming  ♪  electricity crackling  ♪  matt hello everyone and welcome back  so getting us up to speed with the current circumstance  that we left off at the end of last episode  vox machina the main adventurers  spending the better part of this past year  under the shadow of the chroma conclave  a group of ancient chromatic dragons  that have banded together  seemingly under the banner of thordak the cinder king  a great red dragon that had been sealed  in the fire elemental plane for 
none	 a number of years  newly released and carrying with him  what was called a soul anchor  a magical artifact made from the heart of a fire primordial  that had begun to cause him to mutate  and swell and become something beyond what he was  also driving him apparently insane  as he dominated the countryside of taldorei  along with the rest of the conclave  you gather artifacts of great power  called the vestiges of divergence  under the guidance of two sphinx allies  you travel between various planes  and 
none	 gathering these artifacts  gathered allies and prepared for this climactic confrontation  in your home city of emon  now partially brought to ruin and flame  you assembled an army  you snuck beneath the city  you arrived within the center of the cloudtop district  nearly under the nose of thordaks defending hordes  and through a climactic seeming sacrifice  by your friends kashaw and zahra  were allowed to pass directly into the cloudtop  heading off thordak before he could emerge  from his subterranean lair  and lay waste to the armies 
none	  as they pushed inward towards his lair  ♪  travis when you say it like that  matt there you all did battle  with the great colossal thordak the cinder king  a well prepared fight rolled out  and while there was much danger  you all persevered and managed to using the vestiges  destroy the soul anchor  once it was revealed within the body of the great red dragon  his form rescinding and withering back  to its regular seemingly withering size  you it attempted to flee back into its lair 
none	  but the rather rapid and temporarily winged rogue  vaxildan gave chase and  dealt a finishing blow to the great red beast  midway through its cavern towards its lair  there you were joined briefly by your sister  and an ally you had made through this circumstance raishan  one green dragon  the member of the conclave that seemingly had made  a tenuous alliance with you  as her goal also was to destroy thordak  aiding you in the battle raishan followed suit  and upon the corpse of thordak laying cut bleeding 
none	  and dead in the center of this cavern  she wished to take her end of the deal you had made  to be left alone with the corpse for a moment  to acquire some secret knowledge  that apparently she was seeking from the dead dragon  upon releasing the energy from the scroll  which she had utilized the incantation from  you decided that vengeance being your oath as a paladin  and the history that you have with keyleth  and keyleths people that died under the guise  of raishans initial plotting with 
dung	 thordak  to not let this creature stand and attacked it  both you and your sister just as keyleth began to arrive  the rest of the party slowly staggering behind  raishan sneered and went further back into the cavern  you all gave chase into this dark volcanic tunnel system  which then opened up into a large red flaming cavern  filled with lava pools and rivers  and apparently a handful of red eggs  it looked like scattered throughout this room  thick dark red crimson scales  with crystalline formations pouring out of 
none	 the sides  very similar to thordaks primordial dragon form  upon finding not raishan but just this empty space  you looked up to see a series  of arcane summoned meteors  suddenly given form  rocketing from the ceiling of the cavern  and slamming into the floor  dealing some of you a pretty dangerous blow  and sending you scattering across the floor a bit  vex being thrown across the way  you all managed to survive as at the end of the last battle  id forgotten that you had made your save 
dung	  and you actually your bludgeon damage was halved  so vex is conscious though still hurting  sam ♪ whoo ♪ liam ♪ whoo ♪♪  matt as the dust settles  and you all take stock of what had just transpired  you see the snout of the green dragon pull up  into what appears to be a series  of dark volcanic exhaust tunnels  that seem to be like a hive network of  of honeycomb type tunnels  that just spiral off all through the ceiling  and thats where we left off in 
none	 the last sequence here  sam geez louise  matt which previously behind if imif im correct  and i believe i am and if not internet its fine  wellwell do the narrative  we have the three of you in the room  we have percy scanlan pike and gilmore  rushing up behind as fast as they can  grog and kima had stayed behind  to finish up one of the more recent battles  and jarret is just not going in  he is not in a place to follow suit  you got this 
none	 you got this  do not worry its okay  liam before we ran into the bigger chamber  gilmore and jarret had caught up with us if i remember correctly  matt no they did not  laura oh they hadnt gotten to us  liam i remember that they did  matt no they would have gotten into the chamber with you  only the three of you made it into the chamber  liam thats what i mean  matt they got into the tunnel  but they hadnt got up to your guys  the speed 
none	 in which you guys all got there  was basically just raishan and the three of you  then the attack happened  raishan rushed in you rush after her  everyone else has kinda been left in the dust  theyre not too far behind you  but things be as they may  we begin tonights episode  at this next round of combat  continuing where we last did  laura oh god oh god  marisha jesus christ travis oh god oh god oh god  matt so sam why from there  youre fine  
none	 taliesin no stop dont marisha yeah police  matt so at the top of this combat round  technically percy you have the initiative on this  you are continuing to push through this this hallway  you havent quite even at a double dash  you can hear explosions in the distance  and then you guys watch as suddenly smoke silt and ash  come flying through the tunnel from within  immediately followed by the sound of these large heavy  banging explosions  some sort of heavy impact  a series of impacts seem to have 
none	 detonated deep within the tunnel  and immediately set everyone in the vicinity on edge  knowing that something is still transpiring  in a very dangerous way deeper within this tunnel  taliesin i am throwing on my mask and i am running into the room  im actually gonna be spider crawling  im gonna be on the on the walls so that im yeah  i dont want to be in the line of anything that happens  marisha thats awesome  liam spider percys my favorite percy  matt its just the feet percy  marisha 
none	 ♪ spider percy spider percy ♪♪  matt you can if you want if you really want to  sam hes like walking like this  matt yeah taliesinrunning  sam cool  taliesin this aint dr strange this is  liam hes doing this and nothings happening  taliesin out of fluid you know  liam if anyone can make it its you  taliesin i know i got to make i got to make spider spider percy  matt so anyway that ends your turn  youyou run past on the side of the wall  as the 
none	 ash begins to settle around you as you run past  kind of preparing your weapons for a coming confrontation  you glance out to your right  and see there the smoldering wreckage of red scales  and dragon blood that was once thordak the cinder king  you see that and down its about  you keep running  you can see a gentle glimmer in the distance of a battlefield  but youre not quite there yet  taliesin okay  matt okay the top of the round  the three of you finding yourselves in this 
none	 circumstance  we go to the lair actions  so these lair actions are  laura oh god  matt of thordaks lair as this is not raishans lair  but even though thordak is dead  the lair itself has its own natural  naturally occurring dangers  travis damn it matt so  sam what  that dont make no sense man  thordaks dead  his lair dies with him  matt over time  maybe you dont know  travis his home security system still pays for it  laura yeah matt exactly yeah  its 
none	 its on a recurring subscription plan  so there will be  taliesin how do i pee  matt the lava that you had just landed across  so vexahlia as you are knocked from the explosions  of the meteors from landing on your back  and just barely getting back up to your feet  your vision comes back as you see the stream of lava  thats just barely pouring past  very slowly begins to  laura i back up i back up  matt as it opens and sprays here at 20 foot radius  
none	 laura i climb back up and i bump an egg  matt im going to bring out my templates  taliesin no  laura this is gonna kill me isnt it  matt this will explode and all three of you  i need you all three to make dexterity saving throws  marisha oh boy taliesin yay  marisha this is great  laura cool  this is is this  taliesin first roll of 2017  laura oh wait im hasted marisha twenty total  sam twenty totals good marisha yeah  laura seven liam twentyseven  matt 
none	 okay thats fine  so as it is a hotter more dangerous vicinity here  the damage is higher but you all managed to make your saves  so youre only taking half damage  as you all avoid from the spray of magma  that just bursts out and splashes in your area  liam evasion keeps me at zero yeah  matt yes because you have your rogue evasionness  and its three ones alright  laura yay taliesin yay  matt so thatll be 18 points of fire damage reduced to nine  indistinguishable dialogue  marisha 
none	 i mean im not you know  laura still terrified marisha taking it for granted  talking over each other  yeah yeah something like that  or five its debatable  depends on the health of the people  matt next up in the initiative order is raishan  laura oh good  matt so as the splash happens  you glance up and you can see what looks to be  a series of maybe a dozen or so of these volcanic lava tubes  that kind of are these  these caverns roughly the size of a 
none	 very low live  kind of pushed in catlike raishan  you see the head and the tail kind of hanging out the side  as raishan begins to mutter some sort  of an incantation under her breath  you hear the echo  whispering incantation  between the room as it kind of quivers for a second  and her form just vanishes  travis damn it  liam but we saw where she was before she went into  matt you did  sam fight over thats it  thats great  laura oh my god she 
none	 she ran away  sam alright lets mop up here and go home  travis punk ass raishan  marisha the air ate her  matt i guarantee you thats probably not the case  no  travis youre saying theres a chance  matt yes  alrighty  marisha dude  taliesin just shunned her into invisibility  matt great  that brings us next to keyleths turn  laura keyleth just kill her  find her and kill her so we can get  marisha whereabouts was she last  matt last you saw was up in this 
none	 cavernous area  roughly in this portion of the ceiling  marisha but we can assume she probably went invisible and then moved  liam yeah  marisha i could do faerie fire on her  but i mean i dont know where she is  and its a 20 foot cube  itd probably be a waste  so instead im going to cast call lightning  at fourth level  and go fire elemental  matt okay  sam hows that work laura its an ongoing  lightning is an ongoing  marisha yeah its a concentration  
none	 yeah i can make it  sam so it just exists there  ready to strike taliesin like a ghostbuster  sam cool  matt so as you watch keyleths eyes flare  with this bright electric kind of blue yellow light  as the ash and bit of dust  that has been kind of plummeting from the ceiling  from the impact of the meteor swarms  and the movement of some now not seeable dragon  amongst the ceiling caverns  it gathers into this swirling storm  that begins to build and form across the top 
none	  domed portion of this cavern  as it does you watch bolts of electricity  arc through the storm as keyleths form  then whooshes into a burst swirl of flaming energy  her physical body now becoming a swirling fire elemental  you wish to move or youre gonna stay where you are  marisha im going to take a few steps back and question  can i look up and see if like  the clouds are kind of shaping around like a you know  roughly dragon shaped body  that make sense  taliesin shes 
none	 looking for disturbances of the force  matt sure  marisha you gave me that this is bullshit look  taliesin roll a 29  marisha oh thats not bad  with perception perception  sorry im so nervous 26  matt twentysix  glancing about between the dust thats falling  the movement of the storm that youve gathered  at the roof of the ceiling  you dont see anything that identifies  the location of a dragon now  marisha yeah so its fine  so ill take a few steps back  matt so youre about 
none	 right there  marisha yeah oh oh  taliesin wow its weirdly mirrored  okay that took me a second  marisha its totally mirrored taliesin yeah  laura oh  taliesin yeah i know cool liam your screen is flipped  laura thats crazy marisha its fine  its not a problem  taliesin we have the same view you do  laura its actually no i think its better  because were looking at it from his perspective  taliesin so we can say like move us down  and theyll be towards him now  yeah  
none	 marisha im sorry so move me matt further in  marisha yeah down down  sam towards the lava or away from the lava  marisha right there down one more  other way taliesin south  laura oh my god marisha south  yeah thats good thats thats good  taliesin there matt good alright  laura wheres our pointer  matt wheres your laser pointers guys  taliesin where are our pointers  we need new pointers  laura its been three weeks matt  matt it has been i know  sam weve forgotten how to play 
none	  matt thats okay  alright so  marisha its like inverted controls  taliesin im taking diva  matt now is that your turn  marisha yes  matt alright finishing keyleths turn  that brings us to gilmore whos rushing up past  laura come on gilmore  matt keeping up his pace as much as he can  oh boy  i know you guys take me to the nicest places  and hes just jogging as best he can  rushing into the ash cloud  as another one pushes through  some of the wind 
none	 tending to push  and causing swirling little dust devils of ash and cinder  thats gonna end his turn  vex youre up  laura oh  matt so you glance up laura i glance up  matt you see all this happening what are you gonna do  laura im gonna get on my broom  taliesin get on up  laura and im gonna take a health potion  matt okay laura so  matt regular health potion  laura i have a greater  matt okay laura i have one greater  so thats a what 
none	  4d8  matt a greater is 4d4 plus four  remember you guys are pretty low  on any powerful potions at this point  you used most of them so yeah  laura yeah yeah i had a greater left  its jack shit  ten ten whole points  matt there you go ten points of healing  on your broom  laura im gonna go back towards the entrance  post up to the entrance  like off the ground as far as i can get  matt thats about as far as you can get 
none	  you want to stay hovering or just like there on the ground  laura hovering  stay off the ground and can i  matt are you going up ten feet or 20 feet  or are you staying just above the ground  so youre not standing on it  laura im gonna go up ten feet  matt okay  laura and if i can be a little bit further away from keyleth  thatd be clutch  matt okay  laura i mean i dont know if itd be clutch  but it would be helpful 
none	  can i look up  and see if i can see like  dust coming down from any of the holes  to see if raishan is moving around  in the holes on the ceiling  matt roll a perception check  liam theres a storm cloud  laura i know i know  is this pertaining to dragons  so i would get advantage  matt sure  laura thats the same thing liam two 13s  laura so perception so thats 26  matt okay so glancing about unfortunately  the gathering of the call lightning 
dung	 cloud  combined with the other dark ashfilled interior  you dont see anything that signifies  the location of a dragon  you do glance over and you notice  that where you landed previously  one of the eggs was pretty much just destroyed by this  cause it was the area of the meteor swarm  where you guys were hit  so all gathered here  so this egg right here by where you were  is currently just crushed inward and filled with rock  marisha and laura really  is there anything oozing out 
none	 of it  marisha yeah whats  laura i should have looked at it before  matt its hard to see its far away  but it looks like the egg has been destroyed  laura destroyed sam destroyed  laura she doesnt care about the eggs  sam or she didnt destroy it  liam not the mama  laura okay so ive got im so sorry  marisha thats true  travis so its covered with rocks  laura i dont know where my notes are  to see what my spells were from before  i didnt

none	 of damage to the egg  liam im gonna take whisper and take that further  matt go ahead and roll for a secondary attack  liam that is 28 to hit matt 28 that hits  ill mark the eggs that are damaged and destroyed  this one is  liam thats a total of 15  matt oh thats not working too well  good to know total of what  liam fifteen matt fifteen okay  with that much damage the egg begins to crack even further  more of the liquid begins to spill  the 
none	 blade pulls through and you can see  as you tear a chunk of the actual shell  of this egg off and it falls  you have punctured some sort of thick amniotic sac  thats what the fluid thats spilling out of it  but you havent seemingly touched  any sort of flesh or creature within  but the egg is currently has a section that is exposed  liam and i haveif im still hasted  i have a lot of movement left  so im going to fly and hover  about 15 feet above

none	 advantageous  from her perspective  she sees you out of the corner of her eye  she turns to try and snap at you  and the jaws come down and catch the blade  so it doesnt go for the tongue  but you use that momentum to glide it up the actual tooth  and jam it into the gum  you manage to slam up there  and the blood spurts out from the wound and  snarls  rears back and so now youre kind of flying up  by her face now  liam 
none	 i should have like 10 or 15 movement left  with 60 for wings yeah  if i was 15 feet up and she was a little less than 70  matt fifteen feet up yes but youre also coming at an angle  which you lose distance on that  liam so am i at zero  matt youre pretty much at zero yeah  laura ooh like right in front of her face  travis just stay there like tinkerbell  liam okay all done  matt that ends your turn  travis you are grounded  matt 
none	 at the end of your turn  shes going to use another legendary action  to do a tail attack against you  she pulls part of her torso out for a moment  and her tail whips out in your direction  to try and slam into you  that is a 19 plus what is it 32  liam dont think that hits actually  so ill use uncanny dodge  matt thats gonna be 24 points of bludgeoning damage  reduced to 12 so there you go  alright that brings us to kimas turn  kima

none	 the element  marisha but he has fire resistance  matt right which means hell take half damage  from any fire that you deal  however being the fact  that you are in control of your form  youre not trying to hurt something  i would say that you could carefully push him aside  and ill allow you a death saving throw  as opposed to just taking straight damage  liam okay  matt im making a  liam im rolling an advantage  matt an advantage because of your armor yeah  liam twelve 
none	 succeed  so were good were good  marisha were cool were good  sam here let me help you  oh god i killed him  liam i feel like in another dimension this didnt go so well  matt so you kind of roll him over  marisha that would be the most keyleth thing to do  i love you so oh god i killed the thing i love  sam oh my god george i hugged the puppy really hard  liam no no no  marisha im sorry george  matt you barely move him

none	 was kind of like rainbows  taliesin its the angriest captain planet its just the worst  marisha like the most fucked up care bear stare  matt alright so as the spell dissipates  raishan angrily  sam ♪ you got eggs and you gonna lose em ♪  ♪ you got eggs ♪♪  laura oh god  matt alright so that ends that ends keyleths turn  that brings us to gilmore  now gilmore over here is  what else does he have left in the tank here  hes gonna do a level four lightning

none	 the necklace  what about the necklace  matt so gilmore gilmore runs up  and just vanishes from his place  and instantly blinks up over into this area  using his misty step as his bonus action  and looks upward  how do you like it  raises his hand and pulls this way  you watch as this necromantic energy  begins to gather around his hands  a familiar spell to you keyleth  as you watch the diseased blackened veins  up the side of raishans body begin to spread  and grow momentarily 
none	 and kind of begin to  to dig their way into her throat  she begins to pull backward  unfamiliar with this sudden internal pain  rolls a natural 20 for her save  but regardless thats still  laura i like how he genuinely looked kind of disappointed  though that he rolled a 20  travis i think hes just  laura it made me it made me feel great  liam hes a really good actor  sam see were not even gonna need the flute guy  laura i hope he shows up  i

none	 damage  die on my roll  matt okay so as you rush up catchphrase  and throw the axe sideways  it arcs upward and raishan is currently  kind of reeling from the dispel  and angrily yelling into the room in draconic  gets partway into a phrase just finishing  roaring  the axe just jams into the side of her collarbone  and front torso area and  the axe is still kind of wedged there are you gonna pull back  travis yeah ill pull it back  matt so go ahead and roll 
none	 your  taliesin i dont know why youre looking over here for that  travis yeah i got it 23  matt so yanking the axe dislodges itself and you catch it  you see its covered in raishan blood  as you pull the axe back you watch as something just like  a flash of arcane energy around her  and some sort of spell  uncast by her just seemingly  automatically just kind of surrounds her  and her flying begins to speed up  laura she got hasted  marisha but how laura how  
none	 travis i didnt know i was this powerful  what the fuck happened  laura how did she get hasted  liam well well find out  laura what if the brass dragons helping her  taliesin or what if the eggs are helping her  matt yeah you have maybe 15 more feet  taliesin i dont know i just like putting things out there  travis rolling towards that end of the map as far as i go  matt this end sure  laura that end of the map  travis can i go that way  
none	 yeah thats cool  cool matt great  laura oh god  matt that puts you at the end of your turn  shes gonna use legendary action  at this point in her kind of sped up form she begins to  chanting  and theres a slight ripple again in the air  similar to what gilmore did towards raishan  early part of the battle  let me see the  taliesin were making some bad groupings there by the way people  matt yeah  you feel a kind of a strange warmth  and tingling 
none	 sensation within your body scanlan  sam oh what me  but i didnt do anything  taliesin you relieve yourself gently  laura did you just pee  taliesin i cast tinkle  sam i dont get to save or anything it just happens  matt its not a save its against an effect on you  and she rolls to just like how you roll  to overcome her spells counter spell  she gets to roll to overcome  whatever effect is on you with dispel magic  sam okay  matt so thats gonna be the 
none	 last of her legendary actions  laura she just dispelled all of us  can we bust out a feast right now  just like sit down taliesin we can make eggs benedict  we have the makings for eggs benedict  sam does that dispel my fire resistance as well  matt no it only affected the heroes feast  sam okay  youll have to explain that sometime  matt vex youre up  laura so giving a potion to somebody is a full action  matt yes  cause you have to basically get there open it 
none	  grab them and help them swallow it  to have the effect take place  its a pretty involved action  sam that means we dont have advantage on death saves either  right wait  laura did we ever sam yeah we did  laura oh thats from beacon of hope  thats gone anyway  sam is that gone okay  taliesin yeah that got eaten  laura okay then im gonna fly down to my brother  and im gonna cast cure wounds  on him at fourth level  so thats 4d8  sam 4d8

none	 quite as physically hearty  as what you previously faced  and is looking visibly hurt  raishan is going to begin the round  turning to the rest of you  i have business elsewhere and youre being really obnoxious  stay down  and glancing over is going to go ahead  and with both of her hands again release another  she is almost out of spells  cone of cold  laura oh no this is gonna be scanlan  marisha fuck  matt that is i need  so scanlan travis no  matt scanlan

none	 you see a big toothy grin curl across raishans face  little bit of dragon blood curling past her teeth  from the wounds that shes suffered  glaring nervously over at jmon sa ord  who has taken nearly no damage at this point  and is currently up in raishans face  raishan says well im afraid i have to get  to the rest of my day  die amongst your friends as you should  and just tears off of jmon  and goes into a full hasted fly away  sam does jmon get liam

none	 okay  he rushes this way  and as he gets about there he  slams into something that is currently invisible  you see a slight ripple of arcane energy  and you see a series of small glyphs spiral outward  and then it goes seethrough again  he starts slamming his fists on it  of course of course  of course  travis no  matt he goes and  lets see what he has left  travis she made a lite brite wall  matt yeah  travis hes a mime  matt technically he 
dung	 looks like a mime from your standpoint  marisha can i turn to jmon  say jmon can you sense her presence  shes a fellow dragon  do you know where she might be going  or what she might be doing  matt i havent the faintest  i only just arrived  travis oh fuck thordak is outside of the cave  liam are we out of combat now  travis thordak is still in the hallway  laura the rounds still going  matt so were gonna continue going through the order here  laura so

none	 about it  lets get out there  travis alright that ends my turn  matt okay  that brings us to vex  i need you to make a death saving throw  laura right  im scared of all these dice  travis im using whats left of my movement to go towards that egg  matt towards this egg  travis yeah the one shot egg matt okay  ♪  taliesin im gonna try something weird  matt thats two death saving throws on vex  travis you failed it laura i failed it  matt 
none	 vax  liam i stumble over to my sister  and cast lay on hands and give her five to bring her back  matt so yeah cause youve been giving it out  liam i havent done anything with lay on hands  or i might have done it once but i always do very small amounts  i have a total of 15 hit points cause im a third level  matt im pretty sure you used it once before  liam but ive never used more than five with that spell  cause its worthless to heal 
none	  its just good for bringing up  so i have at least 10 hit points left  matt go for it liam five hit points  laura yeah cause the only time you used it before  was when you bamfed up to my broom  after i grabbed the dagger  matt youre still prone by the way  you just basically crawled over and touched her  liam thats fine  im gonna use the rest of my movement to stand  matt okay so you stand up and you still have half your movement  if 
none	 you wanted to  liam everyone whos down whos down  and i dont mean dead  pike just got taliesin pikes up  matt pike is conscious your sisters conscious  liam is kima conscious laura yes  kimas conscious  liam so weve got dead scanlan  taliesin and thats thats pikes problem  liam and thats it im done  wait wheres that egg  matt which one liam it doesnt matter  laura its the last egg  liam im done im done  matt alrighty that ends vaxs turn  laura just worried theres gonna 
none	 be another lair action  in the same spot  matt kima rushes up and swinging her holy sword in the air  goes for a full swing noticing that everybodys now conscious  goes and takes a full swing towards this invisible barrier  as it streaks across you see divine energy go flying off  in a shower of sparks and a giant shimmering  shaking visual on this  this force wall that stands here in the center of the hallway  as she finishes her attack it shimmers unscathed  she goes for a secondary attack 
none	  strikes again  this time as it strikes across  the sparks are even brighter  and you can see the impact almost pushing her back  off of her feet and as the blade comes  to the end of its second arc  she looks up  the wall still stands  travis you are shitting me  it doesnt flicker doesnt  laura it needs like a dispel or something  marisha oh my god i could  oh my god i could  taliesin alright thats an option  matt alrighty that brings us to 
none	  matt jmon  jmon rushes  flies up to the edge and kind of takes a moment  streak a few claws across it  and where the claws streak  you can see the shimmering of this force wall  travis well phones out oh god  matt the phones out oh god  sam hes calling an uber because he knows  were gonna kill him after this is done  matt come on four percent i got four percent left  sam four percent get this man a charger  matt i know sam taliesin  
none	 liam no no no  lets start a youtube video on it  sam can you run this over to matt  matt yeah  jmon with each strike is like testing the boundaries of it  across the sides of the tunnel and just goes  this magic holds  travis what  it holds  itit holds  matt fun charger  taliesin let me know ive got maybe a plan  yeah youve got that  thats an option ive got another plan  you know my plan my plan kind of sucks but  matt im 
none	 not getting a charge  sam give it somebody else  theres a button  matt thats alright  it happens  anyway  taliesin no no it should just start  sam no theres a button taliesin oh there is a button  sam theres a button hell find it  matt jmon oh jmon gets the breath weapon back  and kind of pushes  both kima and gilmore aside  excuse me  and unleashes a blast of burning hot breath across this wall  as it hits it just curls across  and spreads across the 
none	 side of the walls  as the dragon shields  both kima and gilmore from the blast  as it finishes the flame has been split the entirety  and has no effect on the wall  travis holy shit  laura i wonder  i wonder if the beehive thing above us  that the holes are covered in magic as well  travis are you conscious  laura am i i am conscious  taliesin i say well maybe killing the eggs i dont know  kill the eggs  matt pike  travis or maybe its like 
none	 a pacific rim  laura but i dont know what that says  sam ii can give it to you  laura but its now  my question is pike runs up thank you  oh oh  if she runs up is she gonna be able  to get her hand on on scanlan  matt well she was  she was prone right  she just came back to consciousness  so she gets up for half her movement  taliesin we got a minute  got a minute  travis i would have picked her up after 
none	 the last time  i was being pissed about i mean you know shes so tiny  matt being a gnome its one of those things  where 25 feet halved  and you always round on the lower end of the scale  at ten feet shes not close enough to touch scanlan  yet  marisha even with the sprinters boots  matt sprinters boots already got used  its got one round use  laura she says she can use the sprinters boots twice  in all caps  matt alright then  taliesin the caps are 
none	 what make it worthwhile  matt ill trust her  travis shes on a 30 second delay  so she wrote that before we said it  laura actually she did write that before we said it  matt good alright then  then that will be just enough to put her up next to scanlan  laura okay  so pike puts her hands on either side of his face  and says scanlan  your letter to me was wonderful  and i want to do what you asked  but i cant raise kaylee alone i need 
none	 you to come back  and she casts revivify on him  matt okay  go ahead and roll a d20  laura im so scared  thirteen  matt thirteen okay  as she implores to the spirit of scanlan  in this frozen form  you watch as the icy crystals  that have coalesced around his form  and locked him in his place his face kind of  this frozen look of horror  the ice begins to turn into mist around him  and his color begins to return to his skin  his expression 
dung	 relaxes as his eyes suddenly focus  and scanlan you find yourself conscious again  looking up at pike  tears in her eyes pulling her hand back from your shoulder  looking up into the dark you know  glowing lit interior of thordaks lair  sam dont cry  im just a little cold  laura warm up  does anybody have a blanket  sam just hold me laura okay  travis she sent a picture laura she did  she sent a picture of the sprinters boots cards  with two uses  travis used twice 
dung	 while in rest  matt there we go  cool thats what i wanted thank you  so make sure everyone has their equipment cards on them  alright so that finishes pikes turn  scanlan youre conscious now  sam hi  travis welcome back were still fucked by the way  sam whats going on  travis they sealed us in here  with a giant magic screen across this door  dragons breath does nothing kima does nothing  you know anything about this  any limericks for magic cave doors  sam mmhmm mmhmm  laura 
none	 glad youre back scanlan  sam thanks thanks  ive got one thing up my sleeve  its a dog that can run around and help us  thats about it  laura are we gonna have to take a short rest  taliesin no  sam i dont know i dont know  what theres magic there  i cant do anything about that  laura can i can i i know im gonna  can i broom up to the holes  god im so scared to get on this broom again  taliesin well its not were 
none	 still  laura oh in our order  marisha were still going in order  marisha do you still have a mansion  matt well right now as were getting back into this  percy what are you doing  marisha i have a crazy plan  laura did you let the dog out  sam no i dont know what  travis who let the dog out  laura scanlan did you let the dog out  sam keyleth do you have a crazy plan  marisha you only have to cast the mansion door  within line of 
none	 sight correct  sam yes  marisha okay  sam i dont know that thats true actually  three hundred feet 300 feet range  laura do you have it left  sam i do taliesin yeah  marisha okay two things  one before we start burning our seventh level spells  i still have stone shape  can keyleth go up to the wall and do i have enough  is there just enough room in the corridor walls  that i could stone shape  sam i could dimension door out of here  laura why would 
none	 you just  liam you get a tunnel for all of us mate  sam yeah that would just be me  marisha can i stone shape a tunnel kind of around the thing  or is  matt first things first  mordenkainens magnificent mansion  is a one minute casting time  marisha okay  matt so you could do it but in the process of doing so  youd probably go through about 10 different lair actions  in here  taliesin yeah theres that  matt so keyleth youre using you said stone  marisha can 
none	 i stone shape a little passage around  do i have just enough kinda to where i can  where the barrier is i can kind of carve  a little corridor around  liam around or under  matt it would be very tiny  and youd have to crawl through to create enough  cause youre not quite sure how thick the barrier is  so you have to be  have to roll an investigation check  and based on your roll ill let you know  marisha okay  taliesin this is a plan  marisha 
none	 eight  matt eight  youre not sure you can give it a shot  marisha im might as well give it a shot i mean  matt before it gets to you it does come back to a lair action  laura wait but  sam on my turn i drank a potion  matt okay so take your healing  sam thats it  taliesin has my turn not come up yet  laura i hate that we cant get out of this fucking area  matt sorry i asked you what you were doing  taliesin oh 
none	 i want to try something stupid  matt what do you want to try  taliesin i want to try and run headlong at the barrier  matt okay  well you have to  laura dont get too close into this area percy  cause this is where the fucking lair action keeps coming up  taliesin i want to stay on the wall  matt stay on the wall okay  leaving you roughly there  so even a full turn  thats as far as you could get on a double run  taliesin yeah and im 
dung	 up on the wall still  matt cool  alright now now this happens  with this the quakiness of the lair  seems to be subsiding a little bit  there is a tremor on the ground  it only effects those directly around the barrier  so thats my people  everyone succeeds so no one falls prone  so no effect on that lair action per se  alright past that  you can see in the distance  past the wall dark in the tunnel  which is almost pitch black beyond the radius  you 
none	 see this slight purplish glow  and then a flash of purple energy  taliesin god fucking damn it  marisha talking to thordak  sam should i go  laura what are you gonna do  sam distract it do something  travis youre gonna be all by yourself  marisha okay im gonna stone shape  and try and just cast a little  even if its a corridor just right around  matt its a touch spell so you have to get up to it  so youre back there  so you just get up to 
none	 the edge of the doorway  and the wall with a double run  marisha okay matt okay  marisha im go ahead and can i use a bonus action  matt yeah  marisha im gonna use my no no no  im gonna just drink a healing potion real quick  just one of my greaters  matt okay go for it  so it is 4d4 plus four  alright  gilmore  taliesin this poor book has seen better days  matt gilmore doesnt really have anything  that can be of aid right now  
none	 matt gilmore moves over towards you  preparing for what youre up to  and just kind of puts his hand on your shoulder keyleth  and goes whatever youre doing im right behind you  dont worry  taliesin hold you up so you dont fall  matt grog youre up  marisha im not feeling very confident right now  travis you look like youre up to something do you have a plan  marisha im trying to stone shape a corridor through this  but i dont know if its going to be enough  to get 
none	 through the thickness  travis right as a backup plan  travis how big is jmon sa ord  like a big dragon or just like eh  matt about the same size as raishan  travis so we couldnt like all falcor on jmon  up to the spider network of tunnels in the ceiling right  like we couldnt ride him  matt raishan and jmon have a very similar physicality  like their bodies can much like a cat can get really thin  just enough to fit through the tunnels maybe  but not with any 
none	 riders  you guys would probably be squeezed off  or crushed in the process  travis could she get us up there  and then follow us up through the tunnels if we  taliesin we dont know where they go  travis its better than this place  theyre exhaust tunnels  taliesin thats fair although i will say before we leave  we should probably make sure all those eggs are down  before we leave anyway travis thats my idea  and then im gonna end my turn  laura are you gonna run and hit 
none	 an egg  travis oh yeah  laura theres an egg left over there  taliesin hit an egg travis shamone  yeah ill just run towards egg  ooh  im gonna use all three of my attacks on that egg  matt go for it  go for it  marisha egg doesnt know whats coming  travis thats a thats a 33  matt thatll hit travis oh minus five  okay  thats a 31 no 39  matt okay so the first strike  just cleaves through the egg entirely  travis oh matt i 
none	 know  you impact at the point of the bullet that percy left earlier  which kind of left that spider web crack in the front  and that just causes the entire thing to buckle  under the sheer force of your axe as it swings  the egg gets cut in half tumbles over  splattering primordial dragon whelp gore  and you can see the remnants inside  of what is now a twoparter primordial dragon whelp  laura did it look like thordak  travis did any dragon parts spill out of the egg  matt 
none	 yeah as it flew off and kind  travis could i grab a piece of it take a step back  and try and like throw it towards the wall  to see if it bounces off as well  just in case its like a you know lair barcode  matt sure  travis hey we got through  marisha they got the key card  taliesin multipass  matt as you pull it up and this creature is  nearly identical to the one that you pulled out earlier  its still deep red crimson  but like 
none	 fully fully primordial in its visual  you take back a chunk of it and you throw it at the wall  and it just passes through  gasps  sam what just happened  marisha shut up laura you were right  sam what did he just do  taliesin you solved it  sam how what did he do  liam destroying the last egg  sam fucking guy  laura or by  marisha or by its like he said  we cover ourselves in dragon goo  and then we can walk through  taliesin one 
none	 of the two  travis residual goo in my hand i just like rub it all on my face  matt it smells terrible  taliesin you can hop in the egg  its basically a hot tub  marisha we didnt destroy all the eggs right  matt currently you destroyed three of them  and two were lightning baked  and taken off by raishan  sam my voice is my passport  marisha so do it  its hard to say  taliesin i love that movie  laura maybe we should hold onto a piece  
none	 and try to pass through it  taliesin hello  matt well that finishes grogs turn  vex  laura thats me  i used a level did i use a level four spell already  shit  matt im pretty sure you guys went down guns blazing  taliesin somewhere in the world theres a whole chatroom of people  yelling at you telling you  laura oh thats right i did  i did use it cause i was  marisha yeah i was gonna say somewhere  laura so i have a level three left  who 
none	 needs healing  me and pike and everybody  taliesin theres always everybody needs healing  marisha me laura you do  sam i got single dig going on  laura so do i i got five  travis single dig  laura i got five points how many you got  sam i got eight or nine i cant remember my math  its pretty bad  wait if i had one plus eight would be nine  laura so you have nine points  im gonna take a healing potion  i mean im gonna cast cure wounds

none	 i think there were like nine  marisha yeah  laura and then if you hadnt counter spelled the color  matt oh yeah the prismatic spray  that would have been real bad  sam who was she shooting against  taliesin everybody marisha its a spray  matt its a cone that big  taliesin so it would have been almost everybody  matt just so you guys know  cause its a fun spell to kind of talk about  taliesin it is  matt and each of you would have been hit  with a different 
none	 colored ray  i would have rolled a d8 to see what color had hit you  on a one you take 10d6 fire damage  on a failed save half  an orange take 10d6 acid damage save for half  yellow 10d6 lightning damage  so just randomly all of you guys  basically just take 10d6 of something  green you take 10d6 poison damage half save  five 10d6 cold damage  six on a failed save youre restrained  and you have to keep making saves or you turn to stone  seven youre blinded
