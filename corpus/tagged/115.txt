tavern	 knights of  requital who had discussed interest in possibly bringing you in for some endeavor  sam whats his name  laura ulog  matt ulog you had also as the evening progressed finished your night checking out the  evening nip a tavern that seemed extremely shady having some pisspoor ale you had just exited the  exterior of the taverns location out into the midnight evening air of zadash still a bit  bruised and beaten from the battle earlier in the day but eager to continue with what your next  endeavor is mighty nein what 
none	 would you like to do  travis and marisha nein  laura im tired this was a long day are you guys going to keep drinking  travis well not in that fucking place shit somewhere better  marisha are we making our way back  travis yeah i think so  marisha okay lets go back  laura going to just drink at the leaky tap  sam or just go to sleep  laura i guess we wont sleep at the fancy place tonight  sam it seems like its too much work  taliesin bit of a 
none	 pain in the ass  laura its a pain in the butt  sam also was there anything special about the room  laura nope it was just kind of fancy  sam just a bed  laura mmhmm  sam no treats or anything  laura there was a minibar but i think you had to pay a lot of gold for each little thing of it  travis probably one of those ones too where you pick it up and it fucking automatically charges  you dicks  sam magic  marisha is that a thing  travis 
none	 yeah theyre little seals little arcane seals underneath it you pick it up and try to put  it back but the seals gone  marisha the greed of the crown man  travis yep  matt as the evening rainfall begins to fall a bit harder from a soft drizzle to a decent  pour you hear the distant rolling and crackling of thunder as a storm front has slowly brought  its way in as the night has progressed  laura hey its like we dont even have to bathe now  marisha i love the rain  
none	 travis you know if were just going back pumat sol what was the name of his spot  marisha and laura it was  sam a soul asylum  travis no it wasnt  sam that couldve been a cool name though  liam invulnerable vagrant  travis oh yeah how far away is the invulnerable vagrant  matt from where you are now exiting the evening nip its maybe a 20minute 30minute walk to the  middle of the pentamarket  travis is it late evening like premidnight or  matt its pretty late evening its pushing on midnight 
none	 yeah  travis you know what never mind ill do it another day  laura should we go to sleep  marisha lets go to sleep  taliesin sleep yes  matt you guys make your way back to the leaky tap heading up to your rooms and eventually find  yourselves falling to sleep however the distant thunder rolls continue to quake the muffled  interior of the rooms youre at the lightning strikes flashing through the rooms that have a  respective window and the heavy impacts causing you to wake up in the middle of the evening 
none	 at  times with a restless bit of sleep a faint drip of wayward  rain seems to have collected and found its way  through the roof of beau and jesters room and the pattering in the corner of this small  building puddle causes you to frustratingly go and collect it find something to at least keep it  from making that noise throughout the evening  laura we should fold up a blanket and put it under there it muffles the noise  marisha okay thats a good idea i hate ticking or repetitive noises thats so 
none	 obnoxious  laura like tapping  marisha that exactly like that  laura or like clicking  marisha that counts as well  laura yeah i bet that would be annoying if you didnt like it  marisha yeah  laura what about like squeaking noises  liam keep going  marisha the same umbrella category yeah  laura okay  matt as you guys are having this conversation  sam thats a conversation  matt loosely by definition  marisha we just woke up were real tired okay  matt midwee hours of the morning you catch a quick 
none	 glance at yasha staring out the window at  the storm quietly sitting on the floor  marisha jesus  laura yasha  matt she glances over yeah  laura i didnt even know you were in the room with us  marisha youre super spooky at night you know that  matt yeah i get that  marisha youre a little pale so you have this ghostly quality to you i dont know why im whispering  laura yeah were all awake  marisha were all awake now  laura i sit down next to her and i show 
none	 her some of my drawings to the traveler that i did before i  went to bed look yasha its rat balloons i show her a little drawing i did  sam they really are rat balloons  laura little rat balloons and one of them exploding with poison coming out of it  matt you see a hint of a smile at the edge of her lips and she gives a nod thats pretty good i  could never draw  laura no do you want me to draw you right now ill do it okay  matt you 
none	 see her pull back a bit another flash a nearby bolt causes the sky to light up yashas  unfazed and her attention shifts back to the glass of the window again a brief moment of  trancelike attention before you should try to sleep  laura okay  marisha you all right  matt she gives a nod and sits back down closes her eyes still sitting in a meditative position  on the ground  laura i draw her lit up by the lightning and then i go to sleep  matt okay eventually you all come to 
none	 consciousness again sore from the action of the  previous day but the daylight greets you muddled as it is from the darkened grey raining skies that  greet you the thunderstorm is still passing through and a quick glance out through the window  into the main thoroughfare you can see the streets are muddied and in some places gathered  into small pools and flooded puddles but yasha is gone  marisha maybe she was a ghost the whole time  laura maybe the lightning exploded her  marisha thats heavy metal  laura yeah maybe she wandered 
none	 out into the rain and lost her memory  marisha thats a possibility  sam does that happen  laura doesnt it  sam does that happen  laura it seems possible  sam i knew i didnt like the water  marisha she probably just took off to handle some yasha business right though  laura probably we should ask molly  marisha well ask molly  travis are we still in our rooms or are we downstairs  matt thats up to you guys  sam downstairs  marisha we go downstairs  laura yeah  matt you 
none	 all gather in the main area  sam i just came to borrow some butter i was making something in my room  liam i got up early to use a ritual to bring frumpkin back i have enough supplies to bring  frumpkin back one time  matt easy enough to do  laura what are your hit points this time  liam im not here oh lets find out  laura yeah i want to know  liam thats a three  marisha thats better  matt that is better  laura thats at least two kicks  
tavern	 laughter  travis boom exhale damn it  matt you guys gather back in the tavern downstairs you slept in a little pushing like  nine or ten at this point but it is still gray and rainy outside you can see carts making their  way through the mud some getting stuck and having to pull through the beasts of burden trying to  make their way through the tavern interior is fairly light not a lot of people in there a few  folks that are rushing through to grab a quick bite and leaving or having a 
none	 drink in the face of  a rather dreary day but the room is yours what do you wish to do  laura im eating a carrot you guys figure it out  sam did they say they had more jobs for us to do  travis i believe they said there would be more i mean we dont really have anything until this  evening remember theres that meeting that we have  sam where is the meeting  travis its going to take place in the cellar  sam do we have a plan for how were going

none	  one of our other companions  taliesin a total stranger would also be very useful  marisha someone from your deepest imagination  taliesin someone short  sam see thats too many options when you can appear to look like anything i need to focus if  i get lost in thinking what nose should i have bulbous pointy or patrician nose that could  take hours to decide  taliesin right there patrician thats perfectly fair right there  sam so a patrician nose  taliesin yes see one problem already solved  sam what kind of eyes 
none	 what color blue black brown green  marisha greens pretty  travis maybe just one of them maybe youve got a patch over the other  taliesin thats too many new options  sam a patch on one eye what else do i have  marisha maybe you have a cleft chin  laura ooh yes butt chin those are always good ooh yes and give yourself red hair  sam red hair green eyes big patrician nose cleft chin  liam were getting into mr potato head territory i think maybe a simple halfling woman  laura with red 
none	 hair and a big patrician nose  travis bald on top and red hair on the sides  marisha yeah and very curly  sam all right  liam they are pulling your leg  travis overalls with polka dots and a real big bow tie and shoes bigger than you should be wearing  sam i feel like youre describing a specific person  travis no not at all  laughter  laura ooh that sounds really attractive  travis just mull it over add it to your  sam ill think about that one  travis youre rolling

none	 kind of  taliesin yeah she does that  marisha its very mysterious  taliesin shes good shes just got some personal issues thats shes going through  liam its hard to get a bead on her because she always takes up and leaves  taliesin it takes time  marisha i mean we all have personal issues  taliesin i assure you shes worth it shell be back in her own time  sam you seem normal  marisha who you  sam all of us  marisha us  laura were very normal  sam sure  taliesin 
none	 are you sure  laura i mean youre weird we already established that  taliesin yeah no please lets not start calling names  liam yes jester also you have a very nice personality but it is a big one  laura what does that have to do with anything  liam well just what you were just talking about  sam he didnt mean it like that sometimes hes very honest with people  marisha yeah it did seem very pointed and targeted  liam thats because i was speaking to you jester sitting in front of me you 
none	 made the windows  laura i use thaumaturgy to open all the windows like this  matt they all slam open loudly wind and rain begins to suddenly pour in from the side from the  wind blowing it through all of a sudden the few folks that are in there freak out  laura oh this storm is so crazy  matt wind howling  taliesin thaumaturgy to close the windows maybe  marisha see im having a hard time myself getting through to caleb so i feel like its hard  for an asshole to teach an asshole 
none	  travis sometimes having a pupil teaches you something about yourself just saying  marisha i should punch him in the face  travis give it a shot  liam i am sitting right next to you  marisha i was having a side conversation  liam its a small room  taliesin this is terrifying but i think the three most evenkeel normal of us should go to  the meeting i dont think that the three of us necessarily would be appropriate company  laura we might stand out a little too much it would be easy to 
none	 recognize us as part of a meeting  like that youre green but mostly you look pretty normal outside of that  travis thanks jester i appreciate that  liam well switch it around then maybe nott you go with jester you stay up top and i will go  to this meeting frumpkin will stay with you  sam sure yes  taliesin this works for me  travis youre not going to do the cloudyeye thing when youre down in the meeting though right  liam no because i wouldnt be able to hear what they are saying

none	 smart to stock up on items  marisha maybe we can also take the day to ask around and get a little bit more of a bead on the  opinions of the locals on the current political climate  laura i have to return my key to the pillow trove  travis why  laura because i have a key to the pillow trove theyre going to keep charging me a room until i  give it back  travis oh thought your mom was going to pay for it  taliesin thats assuming the money shows up in 
none	 time  travis oh good point  laura well yes eventually she will pay for it i dont want to waste all of the money she sends  on paying for the room you know  travis thats very smart of you jester  laura im trying to be smarter  travis should we set out to our various tasks then  marisha youre very smart jester  laura thank you beau  liam i will tag along with you again because i still have  laura because now you have a fancy coat  liam well its functional

none	 speeds into auction chant  laughter  travis thats my auctioneer  marisha are you going  liam no i am going with jester to this fancy place  marisha youre going to the fancy place  taliesin or with us were going to go shopping  sam unless you want to go with your protégé there  marisha hes going with jester yeah ill go with you guys  laura thats our new bodyguard  liam you are the muscle shes the muscle you guys are the muscle i am not the muscle  matt as you guys divide 
none	 into your two separate groups scattering this side these three heading  over towards the trispire the other three of you guys are heading towards the pentamarket  travis can i grab my mariners studded leather armor out of my room and bring it with  matt you may  marisha along the way can i look for a tailor  matt sure make an investigation check what kind of tailor are you looking for a standard clothing tailor  marisha fucking balls seven someone who can sew me a custom coat a cloak or add a lining to  
none	 something like that  liam i could take you back to where i bought this cloak yesterday if you want to go there  matt it wont take terribly long it takes you a little longer although if youre going to the  same place hes already been to then it completely circumvents that  marisha do they do custom there  matt you go and inquire they do custom work but it takes a little bit of time its a little  pricier as opposed to buying one off the rack  marisha thats fine  matt itll take 
none	 about a day for them to finish the work on it and it will run you about two silver  marisha done  matt if youre providing the cloak were you having a custom one made are you having a liner  put in or having a custom cloak made  marisha i would like to take one of their cloaks and have a blue liner put on the inside to make it reversible  matt okay yeah full purchase of the cloak and thatll put you about four silver for the full  cloak that includes the work the 
none	 lining addition and the time waiting for it  marisha like one of those baggier poncho coats one of those  matt okay so hooded cloak and the front and the back with slits for arms to come through got it  you have that ordered itll be ready by midday tomorrow theyre saying  marisha thank you sir  matt you guys are going to make your way to the pentamarket at this point in time it is still a  fairly moderate downpour through the day as you begin to come through some of the carts are  
dung	 closed in the middle of the market the ones that are more open that sell fresh goods or things that  can be ruined by rainwater and that dont have quite as strong of a canopy but there are some  that are still open they have hooded lanterns out to draw attention towards them you have barkers  shouting out meats fresh meats and trying to get your attention over there but you guys  maneuver through making a beeline to your location eventually you come up to the  warmlooking dark wood exterior of the vulnerable vagrant facility 
none	  travis mutters vulnerable thought it was the invulnerable  matt the invulnerable  travis oh got it  sam is it open  matt it appears to be the doors are closed but it is warm on the inside and upon checking the  door it is not locked  travis nice we go in  matt you step inside the interior and there is one other patron who is currently in the process  of looking through one of the glass cases in the far end of the room you can see its a rather  portly looking 
none	 gentleman probably middleaged or so his hair is curled and unkempt but pulled  close to his scalp his cheeks are ruddy like the cold weather has caused him to get a bit flush  and hes in the process of glancing over as soon as you enter he looks sidelong to your troupe as  you enter and tries to mind his own business there across the room you can see there are two  pumat sols currently one of them smiling and looking out your direction the other one that is  keeping an eye on the gentleman 
none	 in the corner the one that watches you enter gives a big grin why  hello there  travis good to see you again boy it is sure coming down outside wish there was a way to dry  off real fast  matt well if thats what youre asking i would be happy to help you  travis i am  matt he walks on over and starts breathing heavily on you  laughter  travis quietly fuck clears throat what does it smell like  matt his breath is warm there are elements of an herbal scent that 
none	 immediately is overtaken with a  travis sour cream and onion chips  matt yeah its not entirely unpleasant but not pleasant either its a warm cowbreath smell  laura oh i want to pet a cow so bad right now you guys  travis well see what we can do  matt as he takes a deep breath on you once or twice you feel your body warm up for a moment as  he finishes the prestidigitation cantrip and you are suddenly immediately dry  travis that is much better thank you pumat that is wonderful  matt 
none	 it is quite literally the least i can do  travis i had a question for you we found this armor down in the sewers and it seems to have some  matt thats really pretty  travis right yeah  matt yeah no thats really pretty  travis have you seen this armor before  matt havent seen that kind no but i like the designs on it its really pretty  travis yeah heres the thing i spent a lot of time by the water when i was growing up and when  you live by the water 
none	 too much water theme in your design is overkill you know its like the  person that has the beach house and everything is shells and water and lobsters  matt yeah no thats just a faux pas socially  travis yeah i feel like this has some unique properties to it is there a chance that i could  i dont know in some way transfer or copy some of that onto what im currently wearing i have a  little bit more intrinsic value with what i have  matt let me go ahead and have a look 
none	 at it if you wouldnt mind there we go theres a few  other pieces right there if you want to hand those over  travis theyre not really attached im sorry  matt no its all right oh thats a full set  travis i dont know if shells fall out so be careful  matt i appreciate that heads up hey mind helping me me the other pumat goes oh yeah  no worries pardon me sir ill be right back me could you watch him the other one comes  around the corner oh yeah no worries 
none	 now the third one has entered the room and is looking  this is a very strange sight for ye who has not been within the store first  travis i forgot to tell you there are multiple versions of pumat apparently the other ones are  called me me  matt the one whos in the back goes well we only refer to each other as me as were all  technically the same individual there is a pumat prime but hes currently not in the main chamber  oh i havent seen you around whats your name there 
none	 fellow  taliesin oh hello molly hello  matt molly hello to you as well  taliesin pleasure charmed  matt yeah you see the mass of curled hair around the somewhat pointed furred ears that curl  back the large smile under the broad nose very  laura attractive  matt oh hes just a pleasant jolly individual who is massive in size even with a slight hunch  around the shoulders and back stands a full seven feet probably  taliesin if its all right im going to peruse a bit  matt oh yeah no worries just 
none	 be wary of anything youre planning to touch over there oh  and you youre just an adorable little friend there  sam yes its nice to see you again mr sol  matt yeah  sam well ill let fjord finish but i have a request as well  matt well were going to go ahead and take those in the order theyve been received so if  you could respectfully have a moment to yourself there well help you as soon as we can thank  you he turns back around and goes back to you  travis 
none	 nott hands in your pockets all right  sam dont worry  travis okay  matt as the two begin to look over one of them is inspecting the quality of the armor while the  other one closes his eyes and as he begins to focus you watch as this faint little flash  emanates from the armor briefly he goes oh yeah no that there is a pretty simple  enchantment right there there are limitations based on the strength of the enchantment and how  recently its been applied to the equipment involved but since this is 
none	 a simple enchantment  it is something possible to translocate onto a similar piece of equipment it is a bit there is  a cost to it should you be willing to pay for the service but we can probably do that for you yeah  travis is there any chance you could tell me how much it might cost  matt hold on just a second he goes in the back room and you hear these two muffled muffled conversation  travis hes really very nice and accommodating  taliesin extremely accommodating  sam knowledgeable too about all sorts 
none	 of things  matt muted laughter  taliesin all of them  matt he comes back into the chamber so to have this enchantment transferred over its only going  to cost you about 80 gold pieces  travis im sorry a little 80 eight zero or one eight 18  matt eight zero gold pieces as it does require some components to both harness extract and  maintain the enchantment when it is put over to the new piece of equipment  travis right okay let me think on it a bit nott you had a request  matt 
none	 well put a little pin in that one you had a question there little one  sam ah yes you sold my friend a haversack before and it has these side pouches can you  sell me a pouch a little side pouch just a little side pouchy thing  matt sighs you see unfortunately  sam drink cozy sort of a thing  matt i mean i can sell you a pouch its just going to be a normal pouch part of the haversack  enchantment there is an allencompassing object we have others if youd like to buy 
none	 one for yourself  sam other haversacks  matt yeah  sam how much were they again  matt for a return customer do you have the card still on that one  laura you charged me an additional 200 but that was also giving you the glaive  sam oh  matt right with the charge on it i think the total cost was a little over 1000 gold  laughs  laura we got a good discount that glaive was really nice shit  matt it was a few hundred at least i dont have the card in 
none	 front of me yeah i  laura i have the card but it doesnt say the cost ooh it does 1350 fuck oh shit  sam im okay then thats fine i dont need i thought that they could be broken up and sold in  little sets  matt i mean we could look into possibly devolving a smallbased enchantment like that i  mean research and development of that does take a while youd have to fund the endeavor the good  news is when its done youd be the first to have an original enchanter pumat sol 
none	 pocket cozy pouch  laughter  sam how much would that endeavor cost me  matt i dont know ill be right back he goes in the back room again muted conversation comes  back out pumat prime there says that for the process of research and development should it be  successful development of the object itll probably be about two weeks of time of enchantment  and the cost of the overall pouch will probably run you 200250 gold pieces  travis thats mighty good  laura thats a pretty good deal compared to the  sam yeah 
none	 but id just get the side pouch  laura yeah  sam i wouldnt get the full thing  laura but i mean still  taliesin what are you going to put in it  marisha so many things  laura buttons  sam a lot of buttons  laura a regular pouch can hold a lot of buttons  sam thats true ill think on it can i ask you one more question pumat  matt of course  sam i dont mean to pry into your personal existence but there seems to be many of you was  
none	 that caused by magic did you do that is that an accident was that a splicing thing  matt the large looming figure of pumat sol shades over you and slowly comes down onto his knees  this lurching monolith over your tiny goblin frame the face gets tense for a second and pulls  back into this very warm toothy smile and goes oh i like an inquisitive little girl pats and  rubs your head the hand is like a giant mitt that almost encompasses your entire head  travis you get a fucking concussion  matt if 
none	 you look over there he points on the wall you see a framed symbol three diamond  shards that all point to the center in a flux capacitorlike design he goes im actually an  annex of the cerberus assembly so i get certain favors and i do things for them i provide them  occasionally with my capabilities and some enchanted objects and in return they were kind  enough to provide me with well me and him and him  sam so the cerberus assembly is that powerful with magic  matt theyre about the most powerful you 
none	 find in the empire yeah so me and my brothers here are  actually technically were a simulacrum  sam oh thats fascinating  matt but you know we do what we can  sam if someone were to want someone with that sort of magical power you could not provide that  but the cerberus assembly could  matt well i guarantee with enough positive reinforcement with enough friendship attained  with certain members like i have developed over many years of hard work and providing services  perhaps one day you too could be the fine owner of 
none	 three other versions of your tiny self  sam thats amazing are they a secretive group do they have a business card or anything  matt not much of a business card they got members all over most of them are up in the  capital but there is one of them that runs that hall of erudition right over in the trispires  sam thank you thank you for the information  matt of course happy to help  travis you know pumat i think will take you up on that enchantment 80 gold its a bit more than 
none	  i was hoping to spend i could overhear you offering an incentive for being a return customer  i did enjoy most recently unfortunately one of your healing potions perhaps if i purchased a  healing potion and the transfer of the enchantments we could find some sort of a deal  matt make a persuasion check  travis get it get it boy 12 its not terrible  matt i respect your candor i see that you have a keen mind for business relationships however i  do have to turn a profit so i cant do much 
none	 for you there my apologies  travis i understand healing potions were how much again 70 gold  matt no those were 50 gold apiece  travis 50 gold wow i got to work on my fucking memory great i will take a healing potion and  the enchantment transfer please  matt fair enough that will will run you 100 and  travis 30  matt 30 gold pieces thats correct theres your healing potion you get your basic one right there  travis okay thank you  matt itll take about an hour to transfer this here enchantment

none	 travis new leather  matt new leather it is well get it right to you  travis thats amazing  matt turns around  taliesin ive been doing a perusal by the way is there anything thats caught my eye in this  matt make an investigation check  taliesin make an investigation check its hard to concentrate 13  matt okay theres a lot of things here many not anywhere near your price range  taliesin sure  matt there are three that catch your eye that are loosely interesting at least between you and your  allies there 
none	 is one pendant that has a darkened ivory spiral and almost a heart sculpture but it  is roughly sculpted  taliesin interesting  matt that is currently labeled with a fine ribbon at the bottom at 150 gold it states that it has  the capability of you can almost hear it in his voice after seeing and meeting him for this short  time its capable of ensuring that if you take too many hits it will help prevent you from bleeding  out on your own  laura thats good  matt also when you take a 
none	 rest you get a little bit of a bonus when healing  taliesin all right thats interesting  matt theres one of them thats this darkened orangeish ambercolored orb or marble about that  big that is 350 gold  laura whoa  matt the ribbon attached to that one states should someone holding this have the capability  of spinning spells one way or the other they could probably keep one stored in this thing and release  it at a later time  marisha i had one of those last campaign  laura that was a ring  
none	 marisha that was a ring of holding yeah good stuff  taliesin the final piece that i noticed  matt yes this is a really beautiful cloak that has a purplishblue color to it with very fine  edged embroidery in gold and silver that naturally comes out of the cloak like its growing silver  vines at the edges of it its a very fine make this one is labeled at 800 gold the donner of  this cloak would find themselves largely protected in certain ways from the elements or blows or  magics or what have you 
none	  taliesin wow  laura its like a cloak of ac no like resistance  matt cloak of protection  laura cloak of protection like ring of protection  travis it gives you some bonus  laura man i want a ring of protection again  travis yeah we all do  taliesin we all do  travis super squishyass crispy tacos  sam what if we kill all of pumat sol and come back and rob this place  taliesin thats a great plan  matt thats an option  travis i think you only have to kill the 
none	 one  liam prime  travis this conversation did not happen in the game by the way  matt oh i assumed  taliesin what did we each make off of  sam you should be tracking it in your dd beyond currency counter  laura we didnt put that in our  sam i added my 100 we each got 100  laura oh i think i added it  matt yeah it was 700 gold  taliesin okay so i did so i can technically afford this  laura well one of them  taliesin id love to 
none	 see that heart locket if you dont mind this thing  laura did you spit on my thing  sam probably you made me laugh  matt theres the two guys are like sorry cant help you were in midenchantment translocation  could you help him the other ones like yeah no worries i got you hey there buddy what you  looking at over there for  taliesin pleasure to meet you i was looking at this piece right here  matt oh yeah no let me pass you over a little more information about that thats a periapt 
none	 of  wound closure if youre so interested it both allows you to stabilize when you hit zero hit  points and when youre using hit dice to heal up its a little bit nicer  laura is this like if im healing him does he still get the double hit points  matt just when its doing hit dice  laura sorry  travis got to attune to it  sam wound closure you cut yourself all the time that would be very useful  taliesin they tend to sort of heal themselves though  liam is it reusable 
none	  taliesin this is quite nice oh yeah you know what i think im going to treat myself im going to take  it i feel like ive earned something weve had a good run of it and i have never spent this much  money on anything in my life  travis yeah i mean weve got some good momentum right now right what could possibly happen  matt not going to lie really appreciative to have just here in a few days returning customers  willing to spend fine hardearned gold on some finely crafted and enchanted objects 
town	  taliesin i pass 150 gold  matt an absolute pleasure there you say it was mollyoop  taliesin just molly to my friends  matt molly it is  taliesin this is wonderful im going to add it to my other necklace  travis it looks incredible its found a place  taliesin i feel its right to my heart right there  travis pumat before we go i wanted to ask you i know that youre an annex of the cerberus  assembly how do you feel about the governing parties here in town are you happy with 
none	 the way  things are run  matt i mean overall it seems to be as fine as it can be  travis right  matt you know some folks dont have as much coin as others but what can you do to really help  them we do what we can but theres a lot of dangerous things out there we got all sorts of  baddies coming over from xhorhas we got the possible encroaching of foreign powers always  looking to peek over the mountain range and try and steal some of our hardearned materials so i 
none	  think its good they keep us nice and safe and i mean i got myself a fine business too  travis yeah i think its great that you support the barracks do they come in for regular  purchases every week or every month or find themselves in your store more often than not  matt who are you referring to  travis the members of the cerberus assembly  matt oh no they dont come to the store often they usually send requests they make orders and i  have them sent on over to either rexxentrum or 
none	 the hall if thats where theyre going to be  utilizing them  travis thats wonderful well thank you thank you for your time  matt no worries theyre a fine bunch they do a lot of good they keep the crown in check they  make sure theres no abuse of power and they also have been very staunch supporters of helping  promote learning here in the smaller more middle to lower classes here in zadash  travis oh really theyre not as protective of certain knowledges as other parts of the  government might be  matt 
none	 well i mean protective of knowledge in the sense that not everyone can be trusted with  knowledge and im not going to lie some of the things even i know could be real dangerous in the  wrong hands so i think its important there has to be a certain level of control ive seen some  really nutty people out there that i cant imagine what it would be like if we didnt have some sort  of law and order  travis but they might be a bit more openminded to people sharing in that knowledge if 
none	 they were  the right type of person say  matt could very well be theyve been very kind to me  travis im glad to hear that nott molly you have everything you need  sam yes  taliesin yeah ive been looking in the little mirror trying to get the height right  travis did you want to bring the mirror with you  taliesin can i  travis i was joking  taliesin oh thats right fine this is good okay  sam well probably be back in like a day  taliesin well be back  
none	 matt well well be here all four of us  sam goodbye pumats sol  matt pleasure to meet you little goblin lady  travis give pumat prime our best  matt i will right now he goes in the back room as the other two are still focusing on your  armor as you leave the two that are focusing go thank you thank you  travis fuck  matt you wait the better part of an hour are able to retrieve your armor and indeed you now  have the mariners armor enchantment on your breastplate  travis 
none	 thank you for not making me stand out in the rain for an hour without top pieces thank you  matt now the three of you so what means are you attempting to enter the trispires  laura we go back to the gate right  liam yeah you know i had that bad time yesterday but probably different guards there and  i have this cloak now so im going to  laura you look really can i im going to brush your hair out of your face  liam yeah  laura and like wipe at any dirt

none	 the trispires the familiar gate where youve  traversed and failed to traverse once before as you make your way towards the edge you see the  two guards once again step up to the center to prevent entry as they begin to walk up you see  three other figures are exiting the district and the guards stop halt give a nod recognizing  the individuals as they walk past they move on they look to be fairly decently dressed a male  and a female you dont know if theyre married or not but they appear to be 
none	 a couple a friend of  theirs is off to the side all in cloaks hoods up very nice cloaks thick but very wellmade as  the rain is still coming down theyre all bundled up but there is a point of recognition with the  guards as they pass by as they move beyond the guards once again approach and theyre like halt  laura oh hello again  matt hello again  laura yes were making our way to the pillow trove thats all  matt they both give a look over the two of you  marisha 
none	 im all nice and buttoned up belt tied  liam im looking at the ground  marisha looking tough  matt for the sake of this make a persuasion check jester  laura oh jesus okay that was not a lot of flourish there but 17  taliesin it went back to a 20  laura i know it did  matt all right come in you guys quickly make your way through the open gates under the portcullis into  the cobblestone streets of the trispires and there you see the silken terrace the three towers that  mark 
none	 the central part of zadash  laura giggles we made it  liam its nice in here  laura i know right should we ask where the smutty shop is that you want to go to  liam it has a name it is called chastitys nook  marisha and laura laughter  liam yes its right in the name  marisha its a good name  laura i go back to the guard and ask where the chastitys nook is  matt i oh he gives you this weird look as you ask him hes like actually its right 
none	 there  in the silken terrace to the left of the large bakery its the hutlooking thing  laura thank you very much i appreciate all of your help youve been wonderful okay bye  matt of course he says behind you as you rush off  sam a bakery and a porn shop if they find a fight club you guys are going to be orgasming  laughter  taliesin to be fair they make pornographic cakes there so its all right  matt its pretty great  travis oh oh oh  matt bringing in an american pie 
none	 reference wow you enter the silken terrace first off the  beautiful cobblestone streets before you are broken up by small patches of small fencedin  shrubbery and flower bushes the whole interior here is such stark contrast to the rest of the  city it is both surprising and sickening knowing some of the harder lifestyles that exist on the  outside of the walls here there are a few large sights as you pass through here there is one of  the large towers here is part of the ivory and marble structure that has large blue banners 
none	 that  hang down the sides the central tower itself fires up into the sky this centerpiece and  youve known this because youve been here before is known as the zauber spire  marisha zombra spire zombra  matt zauber spire zauber spire the zauber spire it is the central piece of the halls  of erudition campus and lords over that entire section to the north side it is the furthest  tower here there is an area that youve heard of but not been to called the gilded willows which is  the treedappled residential area of 
none	 the city its broken up into several pieces but you can see a  lot of the treetops and there is this very natural almost picturesque beauty of the interior  liam what was that called again  matt the gilded willows its the broken up residential aspects of this area  marisha okay its belair  matt yeah there is the triumph chime which is a sevenstory temple and belfry that has been  retrofitted as the previous and you would know this from learning your history lessons  actually make a history check  marisha okay  travis 
none	 maybe you know it  matt you might not remember it  marisha it was so good too almost did you see that history six  matt all right you know that its there you know the three towers are there theres the  zauber spire the constellation bridge in the gilded willows which is a giant watchtower that  overlooks the entirety of this city and then the last bit is the triumph chime but thats all you  know about them  marisha yeah its like the zauber spire the constellation bridge and whatever the triumph  tower 
none	 is chime i think its a church or a cult or a churchturnedcult i dont remember  laura the constellation bridge sounds very pretty  marisha it is  liam its a good name  matt as you continue in the direction of where you were guided you come upon the very familiar  scent of warm baked goods both savory and sweet it is relatively crowded a lot of the folks are  bundled up they have large mittens on heavy coats and cloaks and a lot of the general elite  that live in this vicinity have come 
town	 here to pick up warm goods to help go against the cold rain  thats now coming down upon the city to the right of that towards the very edge of this road of  various shops and market bits there is a building that is small with a thatched roof like its more  for the visual aspect of it its made to look almost like a small country cottage but its  plainly intentional and is an aesthetic thats been placed onto it to make it look different and  interesting from the rest of the  marisha 
tavern	 like a tiki bar  matt yeah i guess you could say that outside you do see a sign that is written in beautiful  cursive thats arched over the main door that says chastitys nook the doorway is slightly open  and there is a warm light from the interior there is a glass window there are books on display  there but you already see a few people inside its not packed but its making business what do  you guys want to do  liam just before we head that way just out of curiosity what is 
none	 the name of the bakery that is near  matt you actually cant see the name from the outside youd have to go and ask  liam i go and ask i walk into the come are you hungry  laura i always am hungry  liam okay i will get us some sweets if you want  laura really  liam yeah sure why not we are flush at the moment i walk in  matt easy enough to ask as you walk inside there is a whole table set up with warm goods and  a kitchen thats 
none	 constantly going theres about 12 patrons in there right now in the process of  eating or ordering its called the meal hearth  travis your hands are going to be all sticky before you handle the books  liam better than after  groaning and laughter  matt if youd like to you can load up on  liam yeah what are you in the mood for do you want something sweet or something savory  laura oh man this bakery that we had in nicodranas had amazing bear claws  liam bear claws well lets see excuse me 
none	 whoevers running this show  matt in the midst of the chaos you see a young man in his late teens or so with a little bit of a  prickly chinstrap beard very short tattered brown hair but other than that spry smiling he  has an apron on and hes currently putting a small tray on the edge hello can i help you  liam yeah were in the mood for some bear claws the kind they have in nicodranas have you heard  of these do you have them  matt we have bear claws i dont 
none	 know if we have any nicodranas bear claws  liam well take the bear claws yeah  laura yes and then we can compare and let you know  matt as far as i know the only major difference is they load it up with cinnamon  laura thats exactly what i was going to say cinnamon yes  matt we can do that thatll be done how many would you like  liam probably ten bear claws also do you have any hot freshly baked bread  matt that we do as well of course  liam i will

none	 thats good to know i lead the way to chastitys nook  matt as you enter the small shop the interior is beautiful and surprisingly busy theres five  other patrons that are currently perusing through various tomes and stacks of artwork you can see  it carries many books and different types of tawdry decor like rugs embroidered tapestries  candles both scented and not and you can smell oils and incense in there as well its this  mishmash of scents its darklit in the interior but as soon as you enter almost every other  person glances 
none	 over their shoulder at you and goes back about their business as soon as you finish  scanning the room a voice peeks up and goes hello you glance over and see a human female in  her 40s mousey brown hair wild and curly that goes past her shoulders and she has a heavy  sweater on and these big glasses right in front of her face she goes can i help you  liam that is a very handsome sweater you have is that from here in the city  matt thank you so much it was a

none	 brawnylooking man whos dipping a  fainting woman in a delicate dress glistening across the moonlight its slightly pulled open  yeah this is the young adult romance section of any bookstore on full display and the more you  look back you can see theres a few figures in the process of thumbing through the books reading  them where they stand in the middle there are you looking for anything in particular  liam you know my tastes are very varied im always looking for something new  matt ooh i have recommendations if you like  liam 
none	 of course i am very interested in literature recommendations  matt theres zemnian nights very popular theres the enchanting tryst for those who want  more of a fantastical perspective scent of the sea for the traveler who enjoys their perusal  that one is outer empire so folks have varying interest theres tusk love that ones a little  more saucy  all tusk love  laughter  matt if you want something more gentle something thats more of a classic love story we  have guard of my heart shallow breaths are a bit more bawdy  laura 
none	 i want to buy tusk love please  matt right this way  liam as she walks away from us you know im obviously here for a purpose but i like  historical fiction as well and i like when the two things are combined do you know what i mean  laura sex and history  matt she leans in for a moment and gives you a look follow me she leads you both to the back  she plucks a copy of tusk love  sam theres a guy in an abraham lincoln costume just whacking it

none	 shimmer of energy that expands around the  chamber and scanning through and across the books nothing peeks out at you as magical from  the shelves it looks theres only a collection of tomes you get a small blip from the hunched  cloaked figure in the corner thats currently reading through one of the books hurriedly just a  faint source of magic on their person  liam the range i believe is 30 feet if im not mistaken yeah it is am i covering every part of  the store where i am i start to browse 
none	  matt okay i will say let me look at the  if anything looks out of reach of the spell  that i have just cast i will walk in that direction  matt right its concentration so you can pass around you scan the entirety of the room it does  not appear to be that there is anything directly magical being put on any of the shelves  marisha its because this whole place is magical caleb  travis angels and demons  matt the only blip of magic source youre getting is from one of the 
none	 patrons  liam just one of the patrons nothing behind any doors nothing on the shelves okay i wait for  her to return  marisha does there appear to be a used book section like tradeins  matt unfortunately no there isnt a lot of business for used books here in the trispires  most folks purchase and display on their shelves its a symbol of status the more books you have  the more you can display on your shelves the more wellread you are to your guests as you have them  over there isnt a big 
dung	 market for returning things youve read  marisha huh okay you can learn a lot from what people wrote in books  laura i walk up to one of the other patrons thats hurriedly looking through one of the books  matt okay the one thats closest to you or one of the other ones  laura sure whatever one is closest to me  matt the one thats closest to you as you approach from behind he has a dark brown cloak  thats pulled over one shoulder hes wearing a sky blue tunic soft a silk sheen to 
none	 it in what  little bit of lantern light is lighting the interior from the side of his chin you can see  hes got a softer rounder face and as soon as you begin to approach as you arent approaching  quietly he stops the book closes back on the shelf make a perception check  laura oh no perception 18  matt it is shallow breaths  travis breasts or breaths  matt breaths  taliesin heaving  taliesin and travis heaving breasts  travis breathes deeply  laura ooh shallow breaths thats a good one  matt

none	 matt you may she looks over to make sure theyre blocking the view to anybody else  liam i turn with her so that my back is and i speed read four pages  laura are there illustrations  liam oh jeez  matt interestingly enough it begins almost like the silmarillion in the sense that it reads not  very flowery  travis in a hole in the ground  matt it has a very instructional nonfiction historicaltype speech it begins to talk of early  empirical conflicts it begins to talk of the postcalamity  it begins to 
none	 talk of elements of it begins to hint at the ideas of  forbidden romance between sides that were not meant to meet a lot of it begins like and then  this person led this army into this place and these many were slaughtered  liam out of curiosity if i flip through do i see any boning anywhere inside  matt as you begin to flip through she chuckles i understand if that was enough of a  peek and youre interested you could purchase  liam yes its a high quality item you can understand my excitement

none	 it was probably here a long time ago and it was pressed up into this  corner and barrels were pushed up against it to keep it out of sight probably the reason it  hasnt been found until now  sam okay nothing to see  marisha thats really gross  travis no other ways in or out huh  marisha yeah anything else now that i have the light on i dont see anything  matt no  marisha shit long sigh i take one of those bottles of beer then i leave  matt okay its somewhat

none	 in it if we wanted to check it out or we could go kill the gentleman  marisha go kill  sam i dont know is that what were supposed to do kill the gentleman  laura i dont think were going to kill him right off the bat  sam kill him  marisha that feels a little premature  travis we dont even know who he is yet right  sam well we could introduce ourselves and then kill him  laura he could have a whole infrastructure of people supporting him and then they would come  
tavern	 after us  sam all right  marisha i want to know who he is though  laura yeah  marisha super interested to find out who this guy is i feel like we should deal with one thing  im super focused on this current  travis i am too  laura i mean we could hang out in the lobby in this bar and i could watch every person that  comes inside i could draw their picture and know every single patron thats in here so that we have  something to turn into the guards when 
none	 we rat everybody out  sam ooh  taliesin thats a very good idea  travis yeah and i was thinking so the three of us are down in the meeting  sam whos going down  travis the three of us nott if you could be outside letting us know if any crownsguard or  other surly types look like theyre coming in to raid the place you send a message and then you  two run interference if they actually make it inside the doors in case we havent made it out yet  laura just be distracting 
none	  travis yeah whatever you do buy us some time  laura were good at that  taliesin we can be very distracting  travis i believe you  marisha last thing we want is to take the fall for these assholes whoever they are  travis these knights of requital  laura we will hang out up here and just be weird  matt you guys spend the remainder of the evening waiting for this to transpire some patrons come  in some leave youre reading through the book  marisha read the book  laura oh yeah i 
town	 have the tusk love too  marisha you go back and forth  laura i read it and i keep looking at fjord like and then go back and read it i assume its  about some sort of orc love  matt it is actually  travis laughing damn it son of a bitch  matt it deals with the union of halforc and the daughter of a traveling merchant as they meet on  the amber road up near druvenlode it goes into a saucy union between the two but they cant  because what would the parents 
none	 think yeah  laura whats the name of the halforc  matt uh  sam laughing  matt oskar with a k oskar  travis what you reading there jester  laura nothing oskar dont worry about it  laughter  matt oh man beau as youre reading through the book its interesting it begins to talk about  the conflict between the julous dominion and the dwendalian empire  marisha conflict between the julous dominion  matt yes the julous dominion and the dwendalian empire youre uncertain make a history check  marisha dwendalian emp  thats good 17 
none	  matt it begins to name generals and figures caught in this political conflict in the center  remembering back to your studies these names dont ring a bell either theyre obscure or  fictional for the purposes of the story however it does speak of a crick assassin that had snuck  its way past the borders during the conflict and had attempted to take the life of a general named theo  marisha theo okay  sam and marisha theo  matt as bill cosby rudy  liam oh no  marisha ruined forever  matt blame lots 
none	 of cosbys for that one sorry the failed assassination attempt led to the  capture of the assassin during essentially a test of wits between the general and this assassin  marisha okay test of wits like dinner with andre style  matt kind of yeah the assassins been captured removes the helmet and behind is revealed to be  marisha the assassin removed his helmet  matt the assassins helmet was removed by the general after being caught  laura thats the helmet we found in the graveyard  matt its not very good smut at least at this 
dung	 point  marisha wait am i writing down smut right now  travis matt and liam yes  travis of course you are in size 38 font in your fucking notebook  marisha hang on are you going into how theo and the assassin had a thing  matt yes were getting there  marisha okay keep going im into it though this has to be important  travis does it  marisha hes telling it to me  sam just listen just listen  matt the assassin is revealed to be from the kryn empire of xhorhas with dark 
dung	 bluepurple skin  graywhite hair and pointed ears of elvish lineage  marisha okay  travis no leave it alone stop  marisha hes a dark elf right or a drow  matt she is its a female dark elf the armor is described to be chitinous almost organic in its  design though metal you learn a little bit it goes into a discussion of the term crick the  term crick is actually a slur against the people that come from the xhorhasian side of wildemount  its short for cricket because supposedly when the kryn armies charge 
none	 into battle there are designed  holes and tubes in the armor that sounds like a flock of crickets rushing into battle  travis sick  marisha thats cool  its meant as an intimidation tactic its this highpitched screaming cricket chirp that rushes in so thats  where the term crick comes from it is used in a derogatory fashion towards individuals who live  within the empire of xhorhas and kryn the book talks about them dueling wits finding common  ground and getting angry at each other and murderous then turns into this torrid love affair  
none	 in this very anthonycleopatra feel to it its very dry its an older book it doesnt match  some of the imaginatory flair of some of the other smut that you briefly perused as you were walking  in the bookstore earlier you glean a little bit of information should this be accurate at all of  some of the relationships or dynamics of the empire and the xhorhasian folk that live beyond  the border  marisha would i be able to discern where the assassin entered into the city  matt no its not a detailed historical book 
none	  marisha its not like by the third lamppost remove this brick okay cool  matt there we go  marisha this book sucks  liam how far in are you  marisha halfway maybe  liam how long have you been working on it  marisha couple hours  matt as the evening clocks in close to midnight and the majority of the patrons begin to dwindle  and scatter into the night air you watch as ulog enters quietly gives a nod of knowing towards the  two of you then on his own steps down into the 
none	 cellar about ten minutes or so later you watch  as kara the halfelf girl you had met before enters gives you a glance but doesnt  acknowledge anything orders a drink leans against the wall then eventually disappears down  into the cellar as well later on you watch as dolan the human you had spoke with that seemed  to be the one spearheading this meeting before enters with another human male they both look  back and forth acknowledge you guys the two of them eventually splinter off to different sides of  the room waiting one 
none	 and a few minutes later the other down into the cellar area  travis did we recognize the other human male that hes with  matt no  travis does he seem to be armed or shady or have lots of scars on his person  matt make a perception check  travis 13  matt 13 hard to tell at this distance you didnt see any visible or apparent scars or  anything that gave you a sense of shiftiness other than the careful demeanor it didnt look to  be a face of a rugged soldier by any 
none	 means  laura did it look like an undercover cop trying to blend in  taliesin how were his shoes  matt make an insight check  travis how were his shoes  taliesin like nice loafers  laura 20  matt seems nervous but not in a way that triggers your spidersense so to speak  sam are you guys still up top okay im going to go over to fjord and say you said that one of the  members of their group is named dolan  travis thats right yeah  sam if it comes up no

none	 are two oil lamps that are turned low and the four figures you saw enter are  all sitting around waiting as you begin to descend they give a knowing nod and gesture to  please take a seat  marisha is it just the four of them no more  matt just the four of them  marisha okay  travis yeah ill take a seat  marisha yeah we sit its polite  matt as you enter dolan the one who was leading before sits up and goes im sorry what um  liam oh im with my 
none	 friends here theyve shared a bit of what is gone on here and im sympathetic  travis we havent said too much but we thought that he might be somebody youd be interested in  very clever has no love for the empire  marisha a valuable asset good with things  travis thought we could let you decide for yourself  matt they look to each other have a seat  liam thank you  travis caleb this is dolan dolan this is caleb dolan do you have a last name  matt they glance about dolan thrym  
none	 marisha thrym  matt this is horris thrym my partner the man you saw enter earlier  marisha the human male  matt yes you know kara and ulog what was your name again you said  liam caleb  matt caleb thank you very much for meeting us  laura is it just the four of them  matt just the four of them  ulog has been and please take no offense were  just very careful keeping a very close eye on your activities since we last met bit of a scare  as you entered the 
none	 kings hall but ive heard that youve done a bit of business unrelated he  speaks to your skill and we may have he looks nervously over and horris leans forward and goes  we put two months into planning something and it requires certain skill sets ulog if youd like  to elaborate on this the dwarf leans forward pulls one of the lanterns closer so all your  faces brighten up just a bit he turns the wick up a bit so weve intercepted some documents to  lord sutan one of the pretty faces and money grabbers 
none	 over there in the trispire very  politically connected apparently hes been doing some business with a lowlife whos known in the  more crownbased circles as one of those arrestonsight types we believe this individual  might be involved with the myriad  all whispering  matt we tried to bring this information  to the lawmaster orentha  as she is a friend of dolans however we were intercepted by the highrichter prucine shes  about as corrupt as you get in the structure here in zadash she intercepted it so that she  delivered the information ive 
none	 heard nothing since a couple of our members have been closely  watched by the crownsguard ever since so we believe the highrichter might be in on it weve  decided if we can somehow turn lord sutan against the highrichter and then expose them to the  lawmaster theyll either be arrested or ousted from their positions which one would be victory  for those who dont want to live under the claws of corruption in this city and two vacates the  position of highrichter while horris practice may have been irrevocably damaged in the public  eye 
none	 dolan is a respected member of the society here the locals at least we believe that if not  the highrichter himself perhaps another position as things shift it would behoove us dolan puts  his hand up and says it would be helpful to have at least one of us with an ear on the bead of the  inner circle of how law is distributed within zadash while it is not my bailiwick people seem  to trust me and i think thats the most important thing when taking an office weve outlined a  means of doing 
none	 so this is where we may need your help looks over to kara and the halfelf leans  forward all right then so the current plan is to infiltrate the lord sutans estate in the  trispire steal a copy of his wax seal and his handwriting after we forge a little of the  correspondence to this unsavory individual who he was speaking to in this letter we make a new one  that writes about an assassination of the highrichter sealed and signed by the lord  sutan then we infiltrate the home of the highrichter tear apart 
none	 her living space look  like its been tousled and tossed like someone was seeking her while she was out for the night  at a local ball which shell be one night from here before she returns to find her place  destroyed we take this letter that we found and left it hidden within her room she finds the  letter brings it to the lawmaster at this point ulog pipes in real fast sorry  misunderstood she doesnt get the letter we deliver it ourselves to the lawmaster i dont  trust her to take it  
none	 laura laughs this is like us planning  taliesin wow  matt you get the sense that theyre not the most organized or experienced at this but theyre  trying their hand at doing something that changes hopefully the status quo theyre used to so we  deliver the letter to the highrichter or the lawmaster i prefer the highrichter in front of  the lawmaster if we can get the two in the same room so theres no escape we see her  angerinfused then they begin to create turmoil then we expose them both have them dropped or 
none	  arrested leaving the vacant spot and theyre out  travis well i have one question this lord sutan whats to keep the highrichter and the  lawmaster from just going and snatching him up and putting him in chains  matt wait from who dolan puts his hand up and says im sorry reiterate that  travis yeah well were going to forge this letter from lord sutan right saying that theres  an assassination attempt against the richter we go to the richters place we tossle it then we  deliver a letter from sutan saying there was 
none	 an attempt of the richters life so if i was the  richter and i went to the lawmaster id just go disappear lord sutan your richter will stay in  his seat and youll be short one lord if im not mistaken  marisha especially considering you said the richter was already pretty corrupted seems like  assassination attempts in reverse wouldnt be out of her bailiwick  matt what do you suggest then  marisha heres my question to dolan why do you want horris wants to be in the office  matt no dolan is to be 
none	 elevated horris is taking a back seat  travis horris if you dont mind me asking what was your practice  matt i was a physician  travis as well  matt we had a practice together one of us had to take the fall i accepted it myself dolan  couldnt dolan has too much at stake  marisha dolan what makes you think that you can beat the system that you would then be joining  matt well the systems too big for us to deconstruct from the outside at the very least i  can hope to 
none	 improve it from the inside i know the lawmaster is a good woman there are good people  in there but if we can root out the cancers the tumors that threaten to make it what it is and  what it could become thats something we have to try  travis im not shy of a conscience im afraid id need to know a little bit more about this  highrichter prucine hopefully hes a terrible individual  matt she and yes she has been responsible ulog at this point you can see his fingers  gritting into the 
none	 table shes the one who put my wife in that blasted prison  travis i remember you saying that  marisha yeah sorry about that  travis i mean i hate to say anything else without seeing something for ourselves you seem  to have a good plan for getting rid of sutan but it seems you might need some further measures to  get rid of this richter as well  matt we have been discussing that if you have any suggestions please  marisha well you could do a lot with a seal from a lord a lot 
none	 more than claiming an assassination  attempt just throwing it out there  matt like  marisha literally anything else  travis do you feel like the empire or the lawmaster is onto your group your knights of  requital do they know your name  liam yeah you have already mentioned that some of your people were followed and eyed  matt they dont to my knowledge know of the group just some of the individuals  liam which ones specifically  matt well there is themond but hes left and has not gone to a meeting since hes 
none	 started to be  followed he was the one who delivered the letter to the highrichter it was mainly nothing  directly related to our meetings and more just the delivery of our intercepted letter  travis i have a proposal for you are you one hundred percent sure that they havent heard of  your name knights of requital how attached are you to that name  matt not it wasnt something we chose it just emerged from our meetings  travis if you ever want someone to stop looking for something theyll stop as soon as they know 
none	  that thing is gone or dead so how about we frame highrichter prucine as the head of this knights  of requital and let the law handle it the way they will and well take care of lord sutan at the  same time  matt they all look to each other and back theres a little bit of a smile curls across  horris face he nods i think this is a pretty sound step in the right direction  travis i hate to do away with a great name but you work with what you have  
none	 marisha its an okay name  travis you could workshop it  marisha you could workshop it theres always more names  matt do we leave evidence of correspondence in the home of the highrichter then  travis do you have any secret symbols or stamps or seals that you use for communication that we  could plant in the house or the place of dwelling of the highrichter a ring a piece of jewelry  matt no weve been very careful not to do that we could fabricate some  marisha there was also the notice on the kings 
none	 hall looking for yall i dont know if you knew  that by the way i imagine a notice in one of these peoples houses might mean that they have  concern of being found  travis if we frame this the right way it sure would do a lot for your ambitions to become that  highrichter dolan if you were the ones to turn in the evidence  marisha you could win twice  matt dolan pipes up im worried about turning in evidence because theres nothing that could  connect it to the spot however if we 
none	 could plant evidence in the estate of the highrichter and  convince the lawmaster i believe if we speak to her she would at least do an investigation  theyd find this evidence in the home in the right place that could be enough  travis i think it would be  marisha now the lawmaster works under the highrichter right  matt the lawmaster works above the highrichter  travis yeah this will work  marisha yeah  matt you hear a thump hiss as ulog has pulled the cork of a small bottle of ale that was sitting 
none	  there for a while and begins to drink  travis is her name kara  marisha kara i think its kara  travis kara i like the enthusiasm you had about your plan what sort of skills could you bring to  this equation are you stealthy sneaky  matt honestly more of a thinker ulog however she points to the dwarf again who has  finished drinking yeah i used to run with some pretty shifty lot done a bit of burglary in my past  marisha i like that tell us about this myriad a little bit 
none	 what is it exactly that you guys are  so nervous about with these people  matt were not nervous about the myriad other than the fact that the myriads a bunch of  fuckheads that steal enslave and push all sorts of unsavory business theyre the mirror side to  the bullshit the empire does for all that we want to make sure that if we can connect any of  them to the myriad and lord sutan is definitely connected two birds one stone but then we have  to plant evidence in two  travis that can 
none	 be done we have other associates upstairs we didnt want to encroach  too much on your space wed like time to confer with them over the night perhaps meet again  midday tomorrow we should find a new spot though repetition is a recipe for disaster  matt dolan sits back its a good point any recommendations  travis were actually quite new maybe you could provide one  matt he thinks for a moment through his paperwork  travis consult your paperwork  taliesin allow me to collect my additional notes  matt shut up  sam shut 
tavern	 up  matt how about the song and supper inn  travis song and supper inn  matt its on the west side of the interstead sprawl  sam the sas  travis how far from here how much time to travel not far  matt maybe 40 minutes on foot  travis fair enough shall we call it just after noon tomorrow  marisha what name should we be looking for  matt they all look at each other kara leans forward lets say the inquiry  travis the inquiry its got a nice ring to it  matt 
none	 thank you i appreciate that  travis thank you for trusting us i believe we can make quite the impact with these movements  matt dolan nods and smiles looks to horris looks to the other two thank you weve been  needing more than just angry voices of halfenthused common folk people of action are  hard to find that seem to have a trusted heart  marisha ill give you one piece of advice dolan though i would challenge you to think about this  for the night think real long and hard if youre willing to jump 
none	 into the ring some pretty  highranking asshole gladiators should probably be willing to take a few licks shut up  sam whispers asshole gladiators  laura taking a few licks  taliesin shouldve picked up a copy  i was trying to go before you jump into the ring with muhammad ali type of thing but muhammad ali isnt here  travis you gotta pull up pull up  laura yeah lick those gladiator assholes  matt dolans stare goes a little distant as he tries to fully comprehend the gravity of your  statement before slowly nodding  
none	 travis you see fjord shift his weight  marisha you know make sure you know what youre getting into  matt i will  marisha awful people  matt i will take that into consideration thank you  marisha powerful tricks thats all  matt i appreciate that and you i guess as we begin to put this together what are your  specialties  liam i dabble a bit in the arcane nothing too impressive but a little more than nothing  matt good very well then tomorrow afternoon the song  supper  travis would you like to 
none	 exit first or should we  matt ulog leans forward a bit and goes after you  travis much obliged i head out  liam ill go along with fjord  matt make a perception check  sam 17  matt no strange behavior there doesnt seem to be any business or activity towards the back or  the alley nothing that catches your eye to be suspicious or encroaching upon the meeting below  sam everythings okay  travis wow louder than i thought it would be thank you nott  sam you can reply to this message  
tavern	 travis yeah thank you for keeping an eye out would you like to join us inside  sam i cant reply  travis nott would you like to hello  sam six seconds yes you can reply to this message  matt you all regather in the center of the leaky tap tavern  taliesin you come from being touched by some kind of primordial chaos magic something powerful  strange creative and bizarre youve recently had everything turned upside down  laura i really have  taliesin and have started a new path the path you are walking is 
none	 not the one you were expecting  its not the one youre going to find its true you are walking towards some destiny  laura does it say which one  taliesin just not the one youre expecting  laura this is weird  taliesin i only did three cards  laura these are really really really good  taliesin thank you  laura thats a good fortune  sam hello strangers  laura you have a booger on the tip of your nose  sam im just a traveling halfling  laura oh i just told a random person 
none	 they had a booger on the tip of their nose  sam yeah im just a random person  taliesin to be fair you would tell a random person they have a booger on their nose  laura youre a random person with a really familiar voice though you need to talk to fjord  and see if you can figure out how to sound different  sam all right all right  travis thanks for keeping an eye out  sam how did it go  marisha crazy  travis and marisha yeah  travis caleb impressions  laura 
none	 you were down there a really long time  liam what is the benefit for us  travis well my takeaway is that they want to unseat some of the corrupted seats of power here  in the city if thats true if there is an abuse of power im all for removing those corrupted  seats and putting people of worth in their place im also not keen on taking the word of someone  else without getting some evidence of our own  marisha i agree who knows we cant be replacing someone corrupt with someone even worse 
none	  laura we should follow one of them  marisha yeah we dont know anything about this dolan this horris motives or their agenda  travis we dont while were following them perhaps we should try and find out what we can  about this lean in closer closer this highrichter prucine  laura have the ones downstairs already left  travis i dont know  matt at this point you see ulog make his way up and take a different table at the far corner then  slowly over the next 15 or so minutes the other three exit 
none	 the building  sam want me to follow them  marisha should we go now  sam im going  laura wait blessings  sam oh thank you  liam i send frumpkin after her  matt make a stealth check please  laura its like a dry skin you got it  sam thanks  travis i couldnt see it  laura stealth role with advantage  sam stealth role okay not good worse 18  matt which one are you following theres the half elf  sam do i know any of their names  matt theres two 
none	 human men and then there is the dwarf male  marisha we would have told you the two humans two humans  sam the two humans are they traveling together  matt they are you follow them for the next 20 or so minutes before they come to a modest home its  in a little bit of disrepair especially in the recent the recent storm part of the roof is  sinking inward a little bit they enter close and lock the door behind them they glance through the  window and they have a heated conversation back and 
none	 forth if you want to listen then make a  perception check  sam sure  liam i have a hand on beaus shoulder  sam nine  everyone nine  matt its going to be a thing forever  travis yeah it should be every time its a rule  marisha house rule  matt its hard to hear its muffled the walls thick its not an argument more of a lot of  passionate conversation back and forth some aggressive counter points to some sort of  conversation eventually they both settle down with a bottle of wine 
none	 and you glance through the  window you see the one with the blond hair is sobbing into his arms at a table and  sam this is a man  matt theyre both men the other one has his arm around the other and consoles him looking inside  you see its a lot of books across the wall you recognize there are some alchemical vials or other  things that similartype glass containers that can be utilized for that some dried roots are hanging  from the wall a lot of them appear to be medicinal in nature 
none	 after about 20 minutes or so  of watching this nothing strange catches your eye it seems like two people winding down after a  stressful day  liam are any of those books of an arcane nature because im also looking  matt make a perception roll for frumpkin  liam im looking through frumpkin very bad  laura she basically looks like a pennywise like a teeny pennywise peeking through their  marisha yeah just a clown  matt oh my god it does  liam just an eight  matt its too hard to see from the 
none	 outside you can barely tell there are books there the very  low light there is inside you cant make out any details  sam okay  its a single level house nothing fancy about it  matt single level house it might be two rooms no its not quite like impoverished but its  not  sam any papers any weapons visible  matt you do see a heavy crook of some kind like a staff with a big heavy wooden knot at the end  it can be used to defend oneself and also as a walking stick 
dung	 a shillelagh if you will you can  see a general shortsword that is put on a belt that is hung on a wall but nothing in there that  is militarized  sam okay all right  i guess thats all i can glean from this ill knock on the door and then run away before  they can see  matt immediately inside you hear some rustling and all the lights inside go out and it goes dark  you run away  sam oh interesting  marisha actually that was pretty cool you learned something  sam 
none	 ill go back and report to my friends and thats what i saw caleb and the others of you  who are not my friends ill also tell just kidding guys i love you  travis you can drop that uh  sam this is who i am now im sure its run out by now  matt it lasts for an hour its probably run out by now  travis you know what we also need i want some eyes on this highrichter  marisha i agree  travis we should find out where she lives and how she 
none	 treats people see if the stories are true  laura maybe tomorrow morning we can go spy on her house  marisha yeah maybe we can even split a team some people go and spy on the house some people  maybe go to the stockade talk to the people shes locked up  travis sure we might need to find out where she lives tonight though  marisha im down for that  travis i should have asked but i forgot  marisha well is ulog still sitting at the other table  matt at this point hes probably 
none	 left its been about an hour since you returned  laura its hard to find that out without seeming suspicious isnt it  travis no the highrichter is just an official  laura but isnt it weird to go where does the highrichter live  travis not if you have official business with the richter  laura oh okay  marisha at this hour  travis its very urgent business  sam we could find out how the highrichter treats people by posing as people in need  travis exactly what i was going to suggest  marisha interesting  
none	 laura lets disguise ourselves  travis well we dont need to caleb  sam as clowns  laura yeah  liam im sorry i did not catch all of the meeting that you went to the other night are they  paying anything are we doing this for altruistic reasons  taliesin that is a very good question i second that question  marisha i dont do anything for altruistic reasons  taliesin ive never done anything for free in my entire life  liam so has anything been discussed in advance is all im asking  marisha well if 
none	 this plan gets pulled off and we help dolan get in that seat of the  highrichter than we suddenly have friends in high places and i love an owed favor  travis to answer calebs question we kind of forgot to discuss that part  matt you did  travis were new at this we will address that tomorrow for sure before we proceed any further  youre right there should be compensation  laura do you want the rest of us to go tomorrow or do we still need to be look out  travis no i think 
none	 we should all go they should get a look at us as a whole see who theyre  dealing with just in case theres any shady shit  laura should we look like ourselves or other people  travis what would you like to look like  laura i dont care  travis its at your discretion  laura okay ill decide on the day  travis anybody feel like finding out where this highrichter lives this evening  sam yeah yeah  travis lets do it how do we do that  laughing  laura maybe we can ask 
none	 the owner of here  marisha yeah  travis thats a great idea  marisha start there why not  travis jester  laura yes  travis charm him ask  laura okay im going to go ask claudia  matt it is about 100 130 in the morning though  laura oh its already that late  matt you guys met around midnight so you can go try and wake up claudia if youd like  laura claudias not awake  matt not at the moment  travis what about that big white dragonborn maybe he knows  laura 
tavern	 maybe the barkeep  matt wessek is there wessek is sitting back its a very slow night  laura hey wessek  matt hello little blue girl what can i do for you  laura hows it going with you its really late  matt it is very late and im sort of wondering what youre bothering me with this late im  curious  laura well i just remembered that i was supposed to deliver a personal message to the highrichter  and i cant remember where they live do you know  matt sorry i dont  laura 
town	 do you know what area of town it would be in  matt i couldnt tell you the highrichter is pretty well pretty high up there  laura probably like the trispires or something  matt most likely or at least somewhere where its official its my guess  laura okay that was a fun conversation goodbye  matt goodbye  marisha is the pillow trove still open  laura the pillow trove is an inn of course its open  marisha we can try and ask there huh  taliesin getting in would be a little tricky youd have 
none	 to get by the guards  sam its 100 in the morning  travis yeah perhaps we should rest tonight and plan this little needyfolk charade in the  morning we can always take the sewers into the trispires  marisha i know thats what i was thinking  laura yawning we totally can  liam what did you say  laura i said we totally can do that  travis caleb youve mentioned you tried to get into the trispires and you had a disguise on and  it didnt  liam i did not have aoh yeah there 
none	 is some sort of wards on the gates there its something  ive done 100 times in small towns i tried to disguise myself and there was nothing there they  saw right through it and  they were dicks about it  travis do you think it was just in that passage way or do you think its the entire trispire area  laura i feel like that would be a really big enchantment to put on the the entire thing  liam it is not the entire trispire because  travis the entire trispire  liam no not 
none	 not nott it is not i cased the smut shop i looked for arcane things there and  did not well but i was able to use my abilities  travis thatll be it we use the sewers to get in disguise ourselves avoid detection find out  what we need to know  taliesin i can work with this plan  laura i like it  travis shall we retire for the night  marisha and sam yes  travis ill head up to my room first and ill pull molly up with me because i need to have 
none	 a  word with him molly listen i cant get over the fact that nott was going through my stuff i want  to set a little bit of a trap  taliesin oh you want to set some sort of trap or example for her  travis yeah i just want to see if shes learned her lesson or not  taliesin sure  travis im going to put an object in the middle of the room with our door open and were going to  hide out of sight you game  taliesin this seems a little unfair 
none	  sure  travis great ill use minor illusion to put in the middle of the room a bundle of buttons with a  tall shiny flask covered in jewels right in the middle of the room  taliesin do we want to put down some ball bearings ive got a big bag of them  travis i mean i guess so once shes in were going to shut the door i want to figure out what  the fuck shes sneaking around for  taliesin thatll do  travis okay  matt so both of you guys go and 
none	 hide stealth check from both of you  travis 16  taliesin 11  matt you have a passive perception of  sam 12 or something right where is it  laura probably 13  matt no passive perception i believe for you is  sam ten  laura really  matt as you all go to bed what are you doing  marisha sleeping  matt you guys go to sleep  liam oh wait i knock on jester and beauregards door  laura gasps what is it that you want knocking on our door so late at night

none	 i havent finished it  matt you havent finished it yet but a little over halfway  liam okay im going to read it before bed it will take me about an hour good night  laura cackles i think he was bragging at you good night caleb  marisha ill give it to him its fine he needs a little self confidence a little encouragement  matt okay you go read it nott what are you doing  sam i feel the urge to go sneak into a room  travis its just an open door with a bunch 
dung	 of buttons and a flask in it  sam its not even locked  matt no  sam oh well ill push it open and look inside what do i see  matt its empty its dark except for you see this actually make a let me check one thing  on this just to see how this works in this circumstance  marisha lot of great shirts in the store great shirts  matt make an investigation check  sam i mean what is this what is this roll  laura that is majorly cocked  sam okay good 
none	  sam and laura groan  laura you should have taken the cocked  sam seven  matt there you see a shining bag of glittering coin and buttons spilling out of the top of this  small satchel  sam why would this even be here and a flask on top wow do i see fjords belongings over near  his bed  matt yes you do  sam im going over there  travis as soon as she comes in the door the door slams shut molly get the window  taliesin right  sam i draw my

none	 that i have belong to me  sam will you give me the letter i could change your name on it to his name and then he could use  it to get into the school and he could learn more powerful magic and then he could change me  travis change you  sam he could change this  travis clears throat i understand i know what it feels like to be ashamed or worried about what  you look like i do  sam but youre pretty handsome for a halfmonster thing whispering i think jester likes you 
none	  travis you think so  sam yeah  travis well i didnt always look like this  sam what  travis i wasnt always a handsome halfmonster thing  sam what did you use to be  travis a kid just like anyone else  sam still a monster thing though  travis yeah  sam oh just a less handsome one  travis yeah stumpy short big teeth  sam were you a fat kid  travis little bit just sort of misproportioned listen if we get to the  sam do you have any pictures or  
none	 laughter  travis if my myspace is still up you could see them goes back a tick  sam did you ever have braces or anything  travis nope no i did my own dental work listen if we get to the soltryce academy and that  letter doesnt do me any good i promise you could have it and well make sure caleb has a  shot  sam will you promise to keep caleb alive  travis most definitely  taliesin were going to try and keep both of you alive  sam all right  travis you 
none	 look out for us well look out for you  sam can i ask you one favor  travis you cannot have my stuff  sam all right never mind  taliesin remember nott that next time you try and do this and if that letter goes missing again  i can do this to you again i give her just enough of a knock on the head to break the spell  matt okay  travis okay easy easy open up the door i open the door and i slowly open it up like trying to  funnel a 
none	 rat out of the room here you go remember what we talked about  sam i reach for the flask  fuck  laughter  travis i stick my foot out right when she runs by  matt oh man make an acrobatics check  travis you should be fine  sam acrobatics check 12  matt 12 thats enough as youre darting through you see the foot go out and you leap  tumble roll and make your way into the hallway and escape back to your chambers  travis man that was more than i thought  taliesin 
none	 that was very interesting  travis what do you make of all that  taliesin oh i dont know people are strange anyone who looks like us you collect a few  interesting enemies on the way even at her age  travis are you praying over your swords tonight  taliesin of course every night  travis all right can i join you  taliesin sure  travis great  liam come on im just putting up the thread come to bed come to bed  sam do you trust fjord and molly  liam no no i dont 
none	  sam me neither  liam poof alarm  laura and then oskar falls in love with her and he carries her across a field and they love each  other so much  marisha thats so great  laura its the most beautiful story beau  marisha can we go to sleep now  laura yeah  travis yeah the hard turn  matt you guys all eventually find yourselves to rest for the evening awaking in the early  morning the chilled morning air comes through the sky still mostly gray with patches of blue  that poke 
none	 through no rain its still a little chilled theres a bit of fog burning off by the  time you awaken and look out your rooms window the morning is yours what do you wish to do  liam i go to jester and beauregards room and say  laura sultrily oh youre back again already caleb  liam good morning sleepy heads i leave the book leaning against the door  travis killed it in one night damn  matt all righty the rest of you gather  travis yep downstairs  matt you have your morning breakfast  
none	 marisha did you find anything good in this  liam did i find anything good in it  matt more reinforcing more of what was there because a lot of the information about xhorhasian  society is still largely unknown or uncatalogued you get the sense the more you read and the more  the perspectives of this assassins left across the way youre uncertain as to how accurate any  of it is but it talks of a torturous society of bloodshed and beasts a i got an eyelash in my  eye thats great  travis oh thats 
none	 the worst  matt there we go okay were good talking of this terrible life of endless wastes of  carnivorous and cannibalistic creatures and that the crick nation being this terrible place of  perpetual inner turmoil and vying for the next position of power the assassin that falls into  this relationship falls into it as perspective of being saved of being taken from this terrible  place and brought into the good graces of this general and brought into the comforting realm of  the empire however upon being discovered ends up being captured tried and killed 
none	 the last  part of the book deals with the general going through his own grief and the process but also  understanding it never could be and was probably for the best youre left with a unsatisfied meh  feeling at the end of it all  travis would you call it a blue balls feeling  matt kind of  liam there was a lot more historical fiction in it than actual pornographic content i was  surprised  marisha it doesnt really ultimately matter but i feel like that was like a toxic relationship i  didnt 
none	 really feel like the assassin and theo should have i mean he led to her death that  kind of sucks  liam feels like its weighing on you its amazing what a good book can do it gets its grips  into you  sam are we a book club now  travis morning nott  sam yeah morning  laura whats wrong did you guys get into a fight  taliesin nott is just upset because she was trying to do a little reading last night as well  marisha did you get a book  sam not 
none	 exactly  laura here nott you can read this now  sam which is this one  laura thats the tusk love  sam all right  laughter  travis so we set out our plan sewers make ourselves look like poor folk make our way into  the trispire  laura not poor folk rich folk  sam oh wait no but were seeking help of the richter  laura it doesnt matter we cant be poor folk in the trispire we need to be rich folk that need  help from the richter  sam okay thats fine 
none	  liam yeah because if we come out looking like rats then out we will go  sam upper middle class lower middle class  travis upper middle  laura very high middle if not low upper  travis medium well  sam were a family that is down on our luck because  laura like a warm pink center  sam whats our cover story whats the ruse here we need help from the government because bandits  have taken over our house  laura yes oh yes how about we have a trading company how about some of 
town	 our wares got stolen on  the road on the way to zadash by a group of bandits  sam oh we know things why dont we pose as like trostenwald brewers or something and our brew  shipment im spitballing got stolen by someone and we need help to get it back  travis do we know if the highrichters normally rule on or govern over  liam yeah i was going to ask if the two empire kids know about that position  matt you know that the highrichter is the associate judge to the lawmaster the lawmaster 
none	  oversees very high profile judgments and then anything that falls below anything highprofile  marisha circuit judge  matt circuit judge is what the highrichter is things go through the highrichter first before  they go to the lawmaster they gauge what is important enough for the lawmaster and what  remains in their circle which is why you can see the frustration with anything that they try to  bring forth that may have been incriminating to an ally of the highrichter could be easily caught in  that net and not brought upward  marisha i have 
none	 this inventory sheet that i got from the baumbauchs we could use this as claims  that it got stolen and hope for reimbursement  sam stolen by someone in the government  travis or stolen by the baumbauchs i mean if we do something that a family within the trispire  needed representation the law upheld but the richter turned an eye because a more powerful  family was winning out then that person is shit  marisha this is like an order invoice that i have right  matt the order ledger or you mean the letter  
none	 marisha no the order ledger  travis from the brewery that we took in session zero  matt right youre not talking about the letter from baumbauch from the gentleman right  marisha no but in that i have an order ledger  matt yes there is  marisha so we could claim that he never paid due and we are looking for some sort of representation  to try and get our money from the baumbauchs  taliesin i didnt understand any of that  laura i have a forgery kit you guys  sam what are we forging 
none	  travis i dont know if he would hold sway but if he doesnt pursue justice for someone of the  trispire that should tell us enough the baumbauchs are very influential and powerful  liam yes thats true  laura we could change the name of the baumbauchs to something else  sam we could be the baumbauchs  travis what do you think molly  taliesin i honestly dont understand any of this  marisha does it say on the ledger the company that it came from does it say like from dryer  supply and co  
none	 taliesin what accent was that  lauren dwarven  marisha me me being an asshole  matt the timalt store house  marisha the timalt store house  matt correct  travis doesnt timalt make hardware  marisha so it can be from the timalts  sam the baumbauchs stole our stuff  marisha they never paid due on the order that we sent them  sam do we even know the baumbauchs are here  marisha no theyre in trostenwald  sam why would we be claiming something here we need to be claiming from a family thats here 
none	  marisha timalt is from here right  matt timalts are in zadash  marisha they are in zadash they made a shipment  travis if the highrichter doesnt say youre right this is injustice lets take it to the  lawmaster then that richter sucks  liam she could be a lazy ass  marisha regardless its just a story so we can get a bead on her right  liam sure  laura what if we say were from the timalt company they never paid our invoice and they  stole our puppies  marisha thats not bad 
none	  travis puppy crime  laura thats how we would know that it was a bad guy okay  travis so they stole from our invoice and they took all our saint bernard puppies  laura yes and it is very sad  travis okay  marisha what time is it  matt its midmorning 1000  travis what time exactly of the day  matt 1013 am  liam caleb said  marisha is it early enough to where on my way there i can pick up my custom coat  matt yeah you can do that  marisha 
dung	 okay  taliesin especially since it just rained so the sewer will be really damp  travis oh god  marisha are we trying to go through the sewer  travis yeah we have to  laura to get all of us through  travis well lets pick up your cloak and make our way  taliesin do we still have the writ or is the writ gone  matt the writ was retrieved  taliesin never mind thats fine  marisha we can still find the back sewer entrance have nott pop the lock and we know how to 
none	 go  travis why didnt we try to forge a writ  damn it  laura who all can make disguises for themselves  taliesin oh i can figure it out  marisha with my coat kind ofish  laura you can cover up your face at least  matt mmkay so you guys make your way back to the same sewer entrance where you originally embarked  below there are two crownsguard in the vicinity theyre keeping watch of that intersection just  like they were last time they havent noticed your approach yet but they are keeping an 
none	 eye  marisha were going to have to distract them  travis i could have one of them beat the shit out of the other one  taliesin oh  laura why  travis lets do that i cast crown of madness on one of the guards  taliesin thats not going to go poorly  marisha yes so into this  matt okay  travis hopefully from an area where they dont see me casting it  matt make a stealth check  travis oh no  laura blessing of the trickster advantage  travis 14  matt all 
none	 righty  travis oh i have advantage nah  taliesin 14  matt as you hide off on the side you focus and then concentrate on one of the two crownsguard as  the magic begins to slowly filter around the outside of the face the brief little motes of  shadow begin to be plucked from the space and gather around the outside of its head  unknowingly whats your spell dc thats a ten its higher than ten im pretty sure  travis yes it is 14  matt all of a sudden the guard grunts and you 
none	 watch as these motes fit faintly around the  outside like this floating crown on the top of the head you force him to attack the other  travis kick his ass sea bass  matt the guard grunts grabs his blade runs forward the other guard is like hey what  oh screams pulls his shield up whats going on david what the fuck are you doing  travis nott quick let the lock on the sewer thing lets go  sam oh im doing something  laura no we dont have to its not locked  sam what

none	 the other guard hes screaming get help no its an 11 whats your spell dc  travis 14  laura i try to break the gate i try to pull the gate im trying to pull it open  matt make a strength check roll a d20 add your strength modifier  laura oh 17  matt ping you actually break it with your bare hands leaving an opening  laura go go go  travis everybody in  matt theres a scream starting to happen you guys start running in one after another guard  gets one more saving 
none	 throw 13 whats your  travis 14  matt 14 shit the other guard is now wrestling him to the ground and hes trying to hold him to  the ground what the fuck you hear screams going off around now this ruckus is gathering in  the center as people are starting to yell you can hear in the distance other crownsguard yelling and  starting to gather in the middle of this chaos as you all get down in the sewer and pull it shut  marisha that was awesome  travis yeah i mightve fucked that thing 
none	 up  laura keep going  liam were going to be quiet in the sewers because theres things down here  laura oh yeah avoid all the rat balloons  liam they were everywhere the last time  matt you hear all the ruckus up there echoing down inside and other footsteps coming through and  you hear this guy going i am so sorry i dont know what was happening ow that hurts i dont  know whats and you hear hes being held to the ground now and people are shouting and oh man  marisha ooh that 
none	 guy is definitely arrested  matt that guys going to have a bad day  travis he might get demoted a couple days pay  liam he is going to be about 12 inches shorter  travis no come on  matt go ahead and make a stealth check guys  all of you guys make a stealth check  laura you still have the blessing does anybody else need a blessing  marisha were all rolling stealth  travis ten  taliesin ten  laura seven  sam 22  liam 20  marisha 22  matt okay at 
none	 a mass majority you do slip around the same area where you had the original  confrontation you do see some more of those rats scattered about but you manage to quickly dart  by in a few moments you hear a hiss turn as they notice something but they go in the  direction as you go in to move past some of them shift in where you were but no longer where you  are the blind rats are going by the sound and being misled a bit so you manage to maneuver  around without any immediate 
none	 conflict eventually you make your way back to where those webs were  situated before the phase spiders little domain there at the edge still in tatters untouched from  where you left it you head back to the rung and you can see the entranceway into the trispire district  travis did not think about what to do once we got into this part of the plan  sam we need to disguise ourselves  travis right yeah  sam then we go up there and then find out where the richter lives and then pitch our really  
none	 illthought out plan to them this is going to be great  travis yeah i cast disguise self very long black cloak with gold trim like a nice trim  goatee and slicked back jet black hair piercing blue eyes nice looking human  marisha can i take the brown side of my newly purchased reversible coat take out my brewers  kit that i have and take a few of the bottles and fashion them to my waist a little bit  sam disguise self same exact thing as fjord except longer hair shorter mustache  matt perfect  
none	 travis cloak gold trim  sam yeah everything shorter but female just a little outline for the mustache  matt youre like the pallbearer to the undertaker of fjord  travis great analogy  matt thank you anybody else making any effort or are you just doing your thing  laura im going to cast disguise self and im going to be tan short elven woman in a royal  blue lace dress very similar to the one the lady was wearing with the cut out and soft medium  hair pulled back in waves  taliesin im going to 
none	 put the hood up and stay in the back  matt okay  liam i make myself look like the male version of the elven woman that jester did in a similar high  collared clothing  matt perfect this is great  travis fated to do well  sam were a normal family  matt the moment you climb up the top did you leave it locked did you lock it behind you as  you  sam i dont know you tell me  laura no we didnt i dont think we did  matt i think you 
none	 left it unlocked it wouldnt have been a huge issue youre not in danger  well say you left it unlocked because you intended to possibly use it again in the future  you head back push the two pipes and you all climb back into the alleyway you are now in the  trispire district  marisha awesome okay lets ask around and find where this richter lives  matt walking around the city you see a few crownsguard wandering the streets they  occasionally put a glance to not recognize you wandering but dont pay immediate attention you 
town	  do see one gentleman early 60s or so whos wearing this nice frilled shirt with heavy brass  buttons down the front with this potbelly thats tucked in with a belt breeches that go past the  knee before his boots hit and hes walking in the street strutting a bit looking up hes the  first person you see that crosses your path that looks like they probably know the vicinity  sam want me to go talk to him  travis hello sir excuse me  matt yes can i help you  travis im sorry to 
none	 bother you we have business with the highrichter is there a chance that you  could point us in his direction her direction  matt well that is the highrichters estate i do not know if she is home she may be at the  kings hall  travis i really dont care were just delivering a parcel  matt very well lets see dayanas estate is right around that way he points you see that he  has this thin white john waters mustache across the top that turns into this light goatee right at  the tip of 
none	 the chin as he points over you can see right on the outskirts of the gilded  willows that one he points again  travis wonderful thank you for your time  matt it was my pleasure he continues walking on his way  laura i walk like him  travis nott your mustache is much nicer  sam thank you honey  travis do you know what a mime is you just mime this mission  sam okay theres a fierce wind ive got to oh no im in a box oh no the box is getting  smaller 
town	 dont worry ill climb out  liam nott what fjord is implying is you know how i can make myself look like anything  sam im not an idiot  laughter  liam okay  matt approaching the homestead that was pointed out by that gentleman earlier the homestead is  surrounded by a sevenfoot tall stone and mortar wall that tightly crowds the perimeter this is  only maybe a threefoot space between the wall and the actual home you see that the twostory home  is painted in a forest green color on the outside of the wood 
none	 and stone built structure you can see  that there is a front archway to the door that goes beyond the wall there is a small gate  beyond that there is the front door to the estate where there is a stationed crownsguard  laura this looks really well fortified  sam were just going to walk up and ask for  travis ask for an audience yeah maybe if we say that we were sent by the lawmaster for the  highrichter to make a ruling  sam should we leave anyone out to be ready to help 
none	 if anything goes wrong  travis good instinct what do you think  sam i dont know caleb what do you think  liam well youre always good to have hidden away in case something goes squirrely so definitely  you maybe me as well  sam maybe  liam yeah  travis jester id like you to come  laura i want to come with an accent i want to come  travis nice molly what do you want to do  taliesin i think i am a very reasonable personal assistant to anyone who is trying to make 
none	 a deal  travis indeed what would your name be in this situation  taliesin do we have to have names  travis im just trying to think ahead  taliesin well fine erikson  travis lovely  marisha lawrence is great worked for me before  travis lawrence  marisha actually no lets do something else considering i already used lawrence once  sam its just a fucking name pick anything sorry  laughter  taliesin do you need a drink  sam yes i do i had a terrible night last night  laura how about marge  
none	 marisha francis francis titmalt timalt not titmalt  travis are you staying out here with nott caleb or are you going to come in if we make it in  liam if you make it in no im going to stay with nott i will be backup youre a good  talker we dont need two good talkers  sam what about the cat  liam yeah oh cat  sam how will we know whats going on inside  laura they dont like cats here in the trispire  liam i think that were hidden away in case things 
none	 go bad with the crownsguard after that  then theyre on their own i think  travis thats right wish us luck  marisha lets go  travis i walk up to one of the two crownsguard outside the door  laura i follow behind him  marisha super official  liam be careful twinnie  matt there is actually only one crownsguard at the front door behind the gate as you approach  arms crossed  travis yes please look lively unfortunately weve been sent here from the lawmaster we have  some very urgent business with highrichter prucine 
dung	 please if you wouldnt mind would you  fetch her  matt make a deception check  travis natural 20  matt glad you fixed that the guard goes oh i just a second goes and opens the door  leaning inside highrichter you have guests out front a voice goes tell them to wait a moment  laura i like her already  matt a moment passes the crownsguard steps out of the way and you see emerge from the doorway an  older female halfelf with dark redpurple hair that is short on the sides and brushed to 
none	 one  side almost to a point she has a gaunt angular appearance and is in the process of putting on  ceremonial gold and white armor similar to what you had seen on the herald of the hall but a more  elaborate design and taken from the process of buckling together a brace she walks up and goes  all right now whos here for their time with me  travis oh highrichter its so lovely to see you again i know its been quite a while  matt i have no idea who you are  travis 
none	 brantley we met must have been years ago now you remember the gala  marisha i think it was a fundraiser last time you were up for election  matt make a deception check  travis yeah 14 plus four 18  matt yes of course i recall its been some time what brings you to the front of my homestead  in the middle of the day im on my way to the hall  travis i understand a bit of terrible business actually our family has been unfortunately at the  poor end of some corporate espionage and 
none	 im afraid the baumbauchs isnt that who they are in  trostenwald  laura terrible evil the baumbauchs  marisha especially that demedan  travis just a wretched fellow theyve made off with quite a bit of our product and we have some  evidence against them we tried to take it to the lawmaster of course we didnt want to trouble  you but  marisha she directed us here we thought well dayana is just so sweet she would of course help  us out  travis absolutely  marisha here is the invoice from the amount due 
none	 that they have not paid from the timalt store house  travis im sure justice will be swift but unfortunately much of our familys finances are  wrapped up in this  laura and they took our puppies  matt i would like both of you to make deception checks please  liam caleb is turning the diamond over and over in his hand like a fidget spinner watching all of this  travis at least you have the diamond right  marisha oh my god what should i roll give me something good thats not too bad 15  
none	 laura six  matt she goes puppies im sure well baumbauch is outside of the zadash jurisdiction  that is trostenwald territory im afraid that is not something i would nor could handle if i wanted  to if you wish to bring them to justice either present your evidence to the lawmaster of  trostenwald or bring baumbauch to me otherwise i have no interest  travis im sure you can understand our situation we have already done that exact thing we wouldnt  waste your time with such rudimentary worries but–  matt then why are you wasting 
none	 my time right now  travis well frankly the lawmaster in trostenwald seemed to show you very little respect  when we mentioned your name and being that our family is so influential around here were going  to be tossed to the wayside if justice isnt found surely you understand that  marisha and of course we would happily pay you for any type of additional services you might be  able to help us out with  matt am i– step inside the crownsguard step inside and close the door behind am i to  understand that youve 
none	 come out here in broad daylight to my estate in an attempt to bribe the  highrichter of zadash  travis was that what you said  marisha no i dont think those were my words at all no  travis it was merely a few pennies for your time  laura a favor for a favor  travis yes i mean certainly if you feel like doing justice on its own– i would like to see  people taken care of that take care of us  matt so long as its not a bribe favors we can do 
none	  travis well of course  matt ill see whats possible ill ask around ill take these documents if you dont mind to  see what can be mustered  marisha and of course we are always willing to repay in favors  matt of course there are all sides and types of favors that can be helpful to the crown and those  below  laura also what do you think of puppies  matt i think theyre droll and must be fed to their larger kin so are we done here  travis yes i believe we are 
none	 thank you for your time were most gracious  matt im certain it has been  marisha while he wraps it up can i do a quick glance over her table or over her desk to see if i  see any type of papers  matt well this is on the front doorstep  marisha oh i thought she pulled us inside im sorry  matt no she pulled the crownsguard inside  travis but since were inside of that sevenfoot wall windows doors security measures how many  floors  matt from the immediate front position there is 
none	 the door itself beyond the archway two small  windows to each side of it though it appears that theyre closed and theyre bisected with wooden  beams between  travis shuttered wooden shuttered closed  matt they are shuttered yeah from the inside youd open them from the inside to bring in the  light but theyre currently closed the second floor above you do see one balcony its a bit  receded and theres a balcony that looks out over it all with a second set of doors but that is  currently closed  marisha okay  
none	 taliesin while were bowing on our way out im going to drop my waterskin and spill it  matt okay  laura erikson  taliesin oh im so sorry my lord  laura every time every time  taliesin as im cleaning it up im going to make eye contact just briefly what do i see  i was curious what the reaction to this ridiculous creature is spilling shit all over her front lawn  thats all  matt oh i got you i follow you now  taliesin yeah  matt there is an immediate bit of a 
none	 scowl and i would also ask nicely if youll stop bringing  these demon bloods onto my estate to be ruining  marisha thats what we were looking for this whole time  laura like the puppy thing wasnt enough come on  travis i mean theyre kicking cats in this bitch so its not that far off  taliesin a thousand apologies my lord ill take your sister and make sure she gets her medicine  travis you embarrass me  laura how dare you erickson  travis please make sure shes beaten as you lead her away i 
none	 apologize for his fuddyduddyness  marisha its hard to find good help these days  travis thank you for your time good day  matt she turns around wordlessly and goes inside and slams the door  marisha go guys lets go  taliesin theres easy ways to find out if people are terrible or not  travis yeah that was good well we walk a fair distance away from the crownsguard and we see  caleb and little pallbearer  sam did they oh hi honey  travis like a small morticia addams  laura with a mustache  
none	 liam so weve got it buttoned down  sam did she offer to kill a bunch of innocents or anything  travis well i mean she said that dogs should be fed to the larger ones  laura and she said that tieflings were terrible  sam okay devils advocate here i really dont like dogs either  laura yeah but puppies nott puppies  sam yeah they make great food  laura nott  sam when youre out in the woods and thats all that you have to eat they have very tender meat  and to be fair 
none	 whispering mollymauk is a little bit of i mean i wouldnt trust him either  travis right but imagine if she had gotten her eyes on you i mean dont know what she would  have done  sam well that would make her the same as 95 percent of people in this city  travis but that means shes got to die  sam okay thats true  liam we are not going bring this womans life down in a shambles because she is an asshole i  mean we are assholes ja for different reasons  marisha but 
none	 were assholes without power though  liam okay and  marisha i dont know its less dangerous i dont know  matt as you guys are having this conversation you notice that the streets themselves have long  silken streamers that are affixed from light pole to light pole as part of the decoration along the  streets but you see additional decorations being put up you see bunches of flowers being affixed  to the top of these poles you can see more streamers of multiple colors being placed around a  center courtyard in one of the midareas 
none	 of the silken terrace  taliesin must be some sort of harvest theme that everything is going up  laura yes  marisha its that harvest fest remember theres another tournament and stuff that we can enter into  travis is it just the trispire or is it everywhere  matt right now its just being put around the gilded willows which is a little ways further  away from the estate as youre heading back you can see decorations going up tables being set it  looks to be a small platform being risen theres some sort of event 
none	 coming up fairly soon  taliesin im perfectly content making snap judgements of people ive been doing it all my  life and its very rarely steered me wrong and in another time and another place id be more than  happy to run something  liam okay so let me go over this then we have no form of payment of any kind planned in advance  we dont know if this woman has done anything besides being a snide puppyhater  laura she takes bribes shes a corrupt politician  liam i have personally bribed people i dont 
none	 know that i would listen i do not like the  governmenti say this quietlyi do not like the empire but were really sticking our neck out  with very dangerous people i dont think we have much to go on i dont think we know how were  going to be receiving recompense for this  taliesin there is going to have to be some coin of course  travis certainly your fears are founded if theres not enough pay then obviously its not  worth the risk but i have to say that even after meeting them for 
none	 the second time i feel like  these people theyre good folks i think they just want to see their city bettered honestly  that dolan fellow i think would do better in a seat of power than this current wench  liam well i am willing to discuss our continued involvement once the payment is figured out  travis i think thats fair  marisha i mean look people in power tend to get corrupt they dont start corrupt in my opinion  it doesnt matter whos sitting there as long as we get paid from it who cares 
tavern	  travis and theres still many things to figure out we have to look after this lord sutan but  first we should see to that afternoon meeting about the coin we should address that straight out  laura i guess we have to leave the trispire then  travis yeah i guess we do were meeting them at the song  supper inn  laura what time  travis just after noon  laura just after noon you didnt get an hour  travis i was not specific  sam we dont have watches  taliesin 1201 its just 
tavern	 after noon  travis yeah dont make me say it  liam its on all our minds unspoken  travis im trying not to  taliesin this place is giving me a rash  marisha yeah i guess lets head there meet up with these guys its probably about that time yeah  matt yep so you guys make your way reversing your steps outside of the trispire making your  way towards the western side of the interstead sprawl to the song  supper inn  laura before we leave are there any benches around just sitting  matt 
tavern	 there are a few yeah  laura i want to leave one of the pamphlets for the traveler sitting on a bench  matt okay you sneakily slip it into a small gap so its visible but not liable to be blown away  perfect  laura minus one  matt as you guys make your way to the interior of the inn it is lively it is the loudest  musically tavern youve seen you get the sense both by title and by the interior that this  essentially a perpetual an open mic night for any musicians or 
tavern	 bards who want to come and try out  their craft there are three different bands that are cycling through on the main raised dais to  perform the atmosphere is lively and folks come here for that its a poor tavern comparatively  the interior looks like a lot of the paint is chipped and run or crinkled the smell inside is  not the best but it serves basic food basic drinks and at least an atmosphere of music and  fun some folks sing along and jump into a shanty or two as you come in you 
none	 can see both ulog and  dolan are currently sitting at a table across from each other as they notice you guys approach they  raise a drink and you can see the rest of the table they have ready for you guys to come and sit  liam we have already dropped our disguises if they recognized us  travis it took us 45 minutes to walk here  matt your spells would have run out by now  marisha before we walk into the place i turn my coat inside out back to the blue  laura any 
tavern	 guards in the tavern  matt not in the tavern no there was one outside but patrolling the streets not  everything is super heavily guarded in smaller areas like this  laura does it look like anybody is looking at us anybody else in the tavern  matt make a perception check  sam nice  laura ooh 22  matt i mean no more than anyone looks at you when you enter a room being a blueskinned  tiefling you dont get the sense that anyone is casing you the entire time that youve been there  marisha 
none	 it doesnt look like anyone followed us in  matt you dont notice anybody following you in no  marisha okay  matt you see dolan and ulog are there waiting at the table as you come and join with them does  everybody sit with them  taliesin im going to sit at another table and listen in  marisha fjord and i will go over  travis the rest of you are welcome  sam youve met with them before right  liam yeah  sam so you could go over  liam i could yeah  sam 
none	 lets go join them  taliesin really oh fine  liam well it has to happen eventually  travis molly keep an eye on the room  matt you go with them to the table dolan gives you a look and this is one of your associates  marisha is that a problem  matt no id just like to ask your name  laura tonya fancybottom nice to meet you  matt tonya pleasure im dolan dolan thrym this is ulog he sits there hes like hey  they both take a very long minute and look over you 
none	  marisha hey friend  matt im sorry im just being careful  liam were pretty ragtag but theyre both very good at what they do  laura im blue  matt i can see that  marisha people like her make you uncomfortable  matt no  marisha you sure what about people like him people like him make you uncomfortable  matt i mean only in the sense that theyre fresh faces  marisha all right just checking  taliesin im giving a clear  matt ulog leans in hes like ive watched them a bit theyre all 
none	 friends its fine dolan  goes all right  travis whispers weve got to look for that motherfucker more often  marisha hes fucking everywhere hes been following us a lot you said he was shifty a  little criminal  matt dolan goes all right so weve been looking for an opening weve been trying to find  out we thought it was tonight but theyve pushed it back a day there is a preharvest gala  happening in the trispire tomorrow night we figure this distraction would be enough to do any  of the quiet infiltrations that 
none	 were attempting to accomplish should you still be interested in  coming with us i know there was hesitation and i dont want anyone to be coming into this that  doesnt feel comfortable to be honest i want to be comfortable as well and to know that were  going to bed with the right people are there any concerns any questions worries  travis sure we did some casing of the highrichter ourselves shes not the most savory  type i believe some of my associates have a question of well the unsavory topic of payment  matt 
none	 right i assumed that was probably going to be a thing me and horris pitched in together we  dont have much but this is too important to not me and horris put together about 115 gold between  the two of us he puts a small thing on the table showing it hes not putting it out in the  open because he doesnt want to be like i have all this money on the table hes like we have  some kara put in 53 gold of her own ulog leans in and goes 513 gold 21 silver 
none	 302 copper  its my life savings i want to see these fuckers burn  marisha wait 500 from his personal stash  liam insight check on that statement  matt make an insight check  liam balls total balls  matt total balls hard to read  marisha whispers just under 700  travis thats about the same as the kings hall yeah  sam caleb this job doesnt involve monsters thats pretty good  liam literally no figuratively yes the biggest and the baddest potentially  laura would we be all going to this gala together  matt 
none	 we wouldnt be going to the gala we would be  marisha breaking in  taliesin during the gala  laura oh so no party  taliesin party after  matt party after  travis would anyone of your group like to be joining us kara or ulog yourself  matt ulog still leaning forward goes id like to i have the most at stake here monetarily  ive got skills i think will synergize well with the ones you bring to the table ill be coming  with you  travis i tend to believe him just because we 
none	 havent seen him  laura hes pretty stealthy  matt dolan goes kara her skills are more in the interpersonal level not so much infiltration  and im just me so i dont think id be of much help  laura do you have healing potions  matt actually yes not many we have a few left over horris should have a few more  laura just in case we get hurt or something  matt i hope that isnt the case just in case all right ill have those sent ill send them  along with ulog for you 
none	  laura thank you  matt of course  travis did you happen to draft up any of those knights of requital documents i asked for  symbols  matt oh yes he pulls out a small piece of parchment and discretely hands it to you under the  table you feel it tap your knee as you look inside its a symbol that looks like an r but  part of the r extends beyond to produce a k almost it looks like a sigil or seal that  utilizes the title in it  travis thats actually nice 
none	 work  marisha that is really nice thats good  travis i hate to burn it though  marisha you could do this some graphic design  taliesin did you procure this for us  laura he created them for us  taliesin thats impressive  matt i havent used my art degree  laughter  taliesin wow  travis got dolan drawing it  liam too real  matt i have to ask you because if were all going in on this i have to be absolutely sure  are you coming with us on this you can back 
tavern	 out theres no shame in that but were not going to  go in this without your help as well that would be foolish  travis a moment for us to confer if you dont mind  liam we would like to discuss  matt he stands up for a second and says ulog drink sure they both get up from the table  and walk over to the bar to get another round  laura i watch ulog  taliesin i can probably get one of them the way i did with nott last night if you like make 
none	 sure  were not walking into anything we dont want to be  travis i dont get that impression do you  taliesin no i do not but  travis maybe not just yet  taliesin thats fine  travis i like the offer though  marisha if anything i feel bad feels like theyre investing a lot of money on this play  travis theyll get their return back if hes highrichter afterwards though  marisha if hes highrichter  taliesin and if hes not then they dont have to pay because we obviously failed  travis were just 
none	 being paid to empty the seat not to put him in it  marisha correct it would be super unfortunate to see someone else slide in there other than him  but like you said not our problem  travis nott caleb i know you had reservations  taliesin its a good pay day  liam i want to walk away very fast if this goes wrong my hackles are up it does not feel as sure  a bet as other things that we have done together but okay  sam if calebs in im in  travis well 
none	 see what kind of plan we can come up with we have a day  sam yasha  travis you hear thunder  taliesin i respect this squarely but if you really feel like this is turning then well turn  liam but theres money involved so theres incentive  marisha we have a little bit of time we can still do a little bit of casing maybe go talk to  the gentleman and see what he has to offer in between  travis we have a day right  marisha right a day and a night  matt 
none	 yeah you have the rest of the day the evening and tomorrow night is apparently the  preharvest gala in the trispire  travis when we will strike jester how do you feel  laura i think it sounds fun sure why not  travis oh okay  sam should we order up some puppies to celebrate just kidding  laura ive never eaten a dog i feel like i would feel really weird about it  sam me neither  travis we can call them back over  matt you see dolan and ulog are having their drink at 
tavern	 the bar they walk up and sit down so  can we count on you  liam one hundred percent  taliesin were in  laura the fancybottom name is one you can trust  matt you see ulog and dolan share a look and nod a smile comes across dolans face thank you you  wont regret it i suppose prepare whatever youll need well meet back in the cellar of the  leaky tap tomorrow at sundown and well take it from there you can sense this excited  nervousness to his voice that wasnt there before as 
none	 he smiles  laura do you have a good way to get into the trispire  matt we have a few ideas  laura okay  matt til tomorrow then  travis til tomorrow  matt he gets up and finishes his drink and buttons the top button of his shirt and then  makes his way out ulog sits up goes and takes what swills at the bottom of dolans drink and  finishes it then finishes his drink pops it down til tomorrow he gets up and leaves  taliesin has anyone been watching us  matt perception 
none	 check  liam he is hard to read  taliesin thats an eight  liam level three motherfucker  matt you dont notice anybody paying attention  laura i feel like i wouldve been looking too because i was watching for people at the beginning  of that  matt the only thing you notice is that on the way out dolan  as he heads to the door you see  kara the halfelf was waiting at the door as soon as he heads over she goes so they both  exit into the main thoroughfare  travis i 
none	 actually like what molly said i feel like tomorrow night before we go you should do  your thing on ulog  laura i also have a spell that can make people tell the truth  travis that would work great i think theyd understand too if we did it too early i think  they cause you to cause suspicion after all were only trying to make sure that this isnt a  trap set for us  liam which is possible  travis make you feel better if we had the answer  liam yeah most likely  
tavern	 travis what do we do this evening to prepare  sam get drunk  travis well i was thinking more along the lines of checking out lord sutan  sam okay  marisha we got to go back to the trispire which we can do  laura or no we can just go to the hall of the hall of justice  laughter  liam meanwhile at the soltryce academy  sam and laura the kings hall  marisha is that where lord sutan is  matt you dont know much about lord sutan you havent heard his name referenced 
town	 at all with any  of the  travis they just left and we forgot to ask where the fuck he is twice can we run out after them  marisha and travis wait wait wait  matt make a perception check  travis oh god oh 15  matt 15 you glance through the crowd and you can just make out it the distance the back of  ulog as hes walking down the street about to turn  travis one sec panting  matt as you catch up he glances over his shoulder at the sound of the 
none	 running and he goes  what  travis you dropped this money whispering where do we find lord sutan  matt i dont fucking know his estate hes not that far from where the galas happening  travis just take it and say thank you whispering okay dont worry about it  panting  they dont know  laura but the trispire  travis yeah  matt he knows where he lives thats it  travis they know where he lives  marisha in the trispire  travis in the trispire  liam so its another dance through the sewer 
none	 if we want to do that tonight which we could do  travis yeah maybe that guard got his job back  marisha he respawned  liam yeah i think that ship has sailed fjord  travis im sure hes fine  marisha okay well at dawn we plan  laura yeah  travis well we got to figure out where the lord sutans estate is get a wax seal a writing  forge his hand  laura were going to do all that during the gala  sam yeah  matt thats all supposedly in one night  travis
