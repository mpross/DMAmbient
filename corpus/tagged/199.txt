dung	 matt hello my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor and the dungeon master for critical  role here at geek  sundry and while we may have touched on it in the past todays gming tips is  going more in depth about the idea of customizing your creatures and characters for encounters  music  whether youre running a party sized larger or smaller than the system was actually balanced for  or you want to create your own strange new beasts or have veteran players who have memorized the  entire monster manual and you still 
none	 want to surprise them theres a lot of good fun to be had in  occasionally customizing the creatures you use in your campaign ill be using mostly dungeons and  dragons examples here especially fifth edition but the general ideas and functions work for  pretty much any gaming system out there  so for smaller party sizes of one to three players first off consider the party makeup do  they have a decent healer do they have a lot of damagedealers without a lot of defensive  capabilities you want to make sure you dont create encounters 
none	 or customize creatures or put  creatures in that will wipe them out immediately without some of those usual party dynamic  abilities but you might want to consider adjusting some creatures to have attacks that  inflict conditions over just direct damage perhaps a smuggler throws sand as an attack that  blinds a player until they clear their eyes as an action you could add a trip attack to some  combatants that knocks a target prone maybe a direwolf has a howl that can instill the  frightened condition on a nearby target these are examples of 
none	 attacks that heighten the sense of  danger without directly overwhelming a small party with damage  and if you want to add a powerful enemy for story flavor but it could clean up against them scale  down a number of statistics to bring it a little closer to the party level lowering hp by a  fraction could certainly help but the general defenses across the board can also take a little  hit such as a reduction of saving throws spell dc and armor class gauge which enemies at their  level seem to give them a 
none	 tough fight and adjust your boss foe to be comparable if a bit nastier  because nastiers always fun  now attacks that can affect and lock down the entire smaller party can lead to an unfair tpk if  you arent careful consider adjusting some of these abilities to affect a smaller line or cone  area or perhaps reduce the paralysis status it inflicts to just restrained if most or all can be  hit at once just in case  you can even instill a story reason for the creatures weakened state leaving a fear of the 
none	  healthy version to eventually come evil cackle  for larger party sizes of six sevenplus players adding more hit points can help but it isnt  always the answer just adding more hp to a foe only drags out a lessthandynamic fight if you  dont find other ways to make the battle more interesting for the larger scope of combatants  here are a few ways that you can up the ante without dragging out the battle too much longer  than its intended to be  so for larger party sizes that usually means fewer rounds of 
none	 combat so make sure those rounds  hurt consider a small bump in damage to most creatures if its a solo or small number of  villains perhaps customize existing attacks or adding a new one that can affect multiple pcs a  sweeping cleave that hits all creatures adjacent to them or a slamming tail attack that hits  everything in a 15foot line an arcane ability that summons up crushing vines from the ground in  a 20foot radius grappling and damaging those caught in it stuff like that  this allows your overwhelmed monster to keep up 
none	 with the onslaught of many many combatants around  them and with that many pcs in the field mobility for creatures can also be difficult  consider abilities that can allow it to escape or more quickly move about without a storm of attacks of  opportunity tearing its head off perhaps have an attack ability that also pushes the target back  ten feet now allowing them to move about safely or a move ability that lets them teleport or leap  30 feet without fear of retaliation  heres also some fun general tweaks you could possibly add 
none	 to it as well to liven up the combat  you can implement damage milestones for the creature which means when a foe gets below a  certain threshold of damage they gain new abilities or transform like some crazy video  game boss fight they begin to regenerate or grow a new limb allowing additional attacks or they  enrage and deal even more damage per hit while the combat drags out abilities that can add or change  the terrain of the battlefield are also a lot of fun a salamander who leaves an everburning trail  in 
none	 their path when they walk and anyone who crosses that previously walked path now bursts  into flame and takes damage  you can also implement minor lair actions for nonsolo encounters these are all experimental  ideas and mistakes will be made and youll learn from them to find the real balance for the game  thats part of the fun of running these larger or smaller games i would recommend erring on the  less and then scale higher as you progress that might help prevent an unintentional tpk on your  party when you were in the
