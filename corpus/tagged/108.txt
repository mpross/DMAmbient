janet come on in welcome in  this is probably a good place to hang   to take everything in right and thats it  i wish i could stay in here with you because   this is my favorite room ever  but instead im gonna say time starts now   everyone yelling  matt okay uh  laura what do we do  chris this looks like lauras bathroom  laura i know what do we do  chris i found rabbits foot  /none/  matt my first thoughts walking into that room were  okay this is my bailiwick   this is my realm of expertise   marisha this room is so cool  im hoping they can save the set   i kind of want those wall sconces  chris well the first thing that hits me is  wait a minute what am i supposed to be doing in here   travis i am instantly confused  about where to start   marisha okay you guys  is there something thats gonna happen  travis so /none/ those runes are alphabetical  these are also alphabetical  laura wait theres little things  that means theres probably cards   or something that go in here  marisha okay good call  travis theres a giant wood structure  i see tablets of stone with runes   theres a million different potions  laura i mean the potions alone all the ingredients  a little overwhelming but so freaking cool  marisha can i just live there  i just want to live in the room  heres a deck of cards  laura oh yeah /none/ where  marisha found the tarot cards  marisha theyre tarot cards   matt tarot cards over here as well  laura but i stole them from her  very quickly because apparently i do that  wait im gonna look and see if i can  find special theyre numbered   chris theres roman numerals on this table   travis okay im gonna translate the alphabet  and that message thats on the righthand side  chris travis immediately says im gonna solve this  travis theres three different slabs  that have got little numbers /none/ under them   and then one that im like okay  clearly we have to decipher this thing   so i start looking something to write with  and i find a piece of parchment   and a little quill pen and start  running back and forth trying to decode the message  the first one isnt even here  chris have you finished this  travis no im just looking for  the first stupid symbol  chris im gonna just look at  things on the shelf  the first thing i pick up /none/ is  chris i found a menu for tgi fridays  this menu that has the potions in it  and nothing makes sense  marisha have we looked at this yet  chris okay whats this  travis h thats an h  matt gift of flight these are  different potions possibly  i cannot imagine that all  of these are gonna be useful   marisha gifts of gold frigid fancy  im probably only looking for  like one or two arent i  marisha i said brrr its cold in here  and i /none/ think half of them are  just there to make me look stupid   marisha there must be some toros  in the atmosphere  travis i cant believe you actually  just went to bring it on  laughing  i think the bring it on spell was just to make us look  like really cool   you know i mean if nothing else  then at least weve got that   laura i swear you guys im so lost   everyone agreeing  chris what are we even supposed to be doing here /none/   travis im figuring out that message  and im actually having some luck   laura were trying to gather  were trying to cast a spell  chris do you have a banishment spell somewhere  matt thats what were trying to see here so we have  there are a lot of spells theres a spellbook  theres the little sheets of paper that have spells on them  laura exploding potion   matt for now lets put these out here  chris we can make some of these  laura we can make an /none/ exploding potion lets look  i immediately start thinking i can make  an exploding spell a potion   that will get us out of the room like no problem   so i start looking for ingredients  to make an exploding potion   which is probably the wrong idea  travis the magician  chris one head of garlic   laura theres probably a magician in here  travis the magician is the first part of this thing  marisha the magician okay  chris wow travis youre on top of it  then as /none/ he starts saying the words he says  magician and we realize thats one of the tarot cards  so im going to try and separate those out  that way as soon as we have this riddle done   hopefully we wont be searching  through an entire deck of cards  travis this is going to be the  greatest moment of my life  laura is there head of garlic over there  chris youre just gonna make a random spell huh  laura its an exploding one  itll get us out of here  /none/ chris okay cool  travis there are numbers  marisha head of garlic  matt yeah we got numbers as well  travis what kind of an asshole  puts numbers with runes  o  marisha heres a what is this you guys  this has a little this does that that does that   chris that does that  marisha that looks important right  chris yeah theres another thing  that should do that but you cant pull it out  travis fought maybe is that a fought  marisha is there anything on the bottom /none/ of that chris  laura wait elixir seven   travis sought you piece of  laura elixir seven this ones important   chris i have a feeling what travis is doing here  is probably the most important thing   cause it seems like its the start  marisha while hes got that goin  heres the magician  chris what do you need  we hear the announcement that we only have  25 minutes left   that is when my stomach sinks very heavily  marisha we havent done shit  laura we havent /none/ done anything  that is when i realized we might be in trouble  laura oh no what if we all just die right now  chris guys lets help travis do this  laura what is he doing  chris b  travis whats a k find me a k  chris a k  travis yeah a k symbol  chris k symbol is uh   k symbol is an i whats the next one  travis ive got a u s  this is a i think thats a t  and then marisha finds these /none/ spells that are  you know singing and so we start chanting  marisha and laura boredas stupificus  boredas stupificus boredas stupificus  thats gotta mean im really stupid  in latin that you made us repeat over and over again  marisha and laura boredas stupificus  its gonna live forever on the internet  laura how many times boredas stupificus  continue chanting  thats cool thanks guys thanks  marisha is this just a spell to make us look stupid  laura i think probably  chris what do we have so far  travis is /none/ that a ju i think thats justice  chris okay justice right  travis the magician sought justice  marisha okay so im guessing some of  these potions are just red herrings  travis this quill is not  its magically losing ink  come back to life i got it i got it  travis the magician sought justice  on or in something  marisha jenga restore your wand  to its former might one must  matt hey guys were pushing the 20 minutes   we reached a point where we had been  running /none/ around floundering   we found a lot of pieces to things  that we didnt quite know how they fit together  laura were taking so long  on the very first clue   we need to have the helping hand  matt were floundering a little bit here  do we want to go ahead and try and   at least get a helping hand  to maybe get on the right path  knowing that we could continue to do this  for next 15 minutes if we arent careful   i think we /none/ all began to realize that  its best to just use this helping hand now  all helping hand  janet okay wizard wannabes  heres your rhyming helping hand  marisha oh my god we suck so hard  travis oh w that would make sense  laura okay tower it is tower  travis the magician sought justice in the tower  crosstalk  matt the cards should go in the slots  based on the order they are  travis but but yeah the magician  sought justice in the tower but  hes trying to figure /none/ out the buts  and the thes in between   and i dont care about any of that  i just want the last tarot card  laura whats the last word  whats the last word  travis we got two more words  no no no skip to the last word cause  thats probably what the last tarot card is  matt so d  travis is this one right here  matt yeah  travis d okay and the h one is an “e”  matt correct  travis and then its like a pi /none/ symbol  matt ive drawn these that is a a  travis a  laura whats the last word  chris what is that less than symbol  travis thats a t its death i think  the magician sought justice  in the tower but found only death  death death  i have no idea what that means  marisha the theres another deck  theres another deck hang on   i dont know why theres two decks  matt ill take half of it here  death got it  marisha go go go go  /none/ laura okay oh what do i see  in this amazing crystal ball  chris it just looks like a piece of glass to me  whoa its turning blue  laura oh its doing something  the crystal ball lights up  matt starts reading it  matt oh right here it says  marisha oh shit  i start trying to push his head out of the way  so i can see the words cause apparently i do that  matt eth topnoi fo sncseipua awesome  chris oh that makes lots of sense  its a /none/ cool message and it reads like latin  but within a brief second i realize   that its an anagram and we need to try  and figure out what these letters make up  laura is it backwards  marisha read it backwards  chris the potion of uh  travis you suck  matt aupiescns makes a lot of sense  marisha aup  matt aupiescns  we immediately had to just shout out the letters  and try and figure out   what the actual phrasing was hopefully  chris aupi   marisha are /none/ you sure you guys  matt those are the letters that are there  laura yeah its an anagram  these letters make a spell  marisha wait wait wait  is it this purification  laura but purification isnt  theres no f in this  chris the okay the lets  just rearrange the words its eth so its the  laura thats it the potion of puissance  matt gain might to wrench from stone  we find this list of ingredients to make a potion  matt by mixing dust of funny bone  its supposed /none/ to make us strong so  we can pull the sword out from the stone  laura dust of funny bone  chris what else do we need  matt how about this the sorrow  of a fiery beast and essence of a spiders feast  marisha okay heres dragons breath  chris drops of water  travis sorrow of what  matt lets see drops of water undeads bane  so holy water  im glad that matt is here because  hes really good at interpreting   what a lot of these sentences even mean  /none/ matt flies is what it would be  laura snake fangs   matt see if you can find holy water  laura no wait wait wait  travis theres water  laura theres water  travis yeah can we like bless it  laura what about water  matt deep blackened sea nights stain  chris octopus ink  matt there we go  mind of beast lacking haste   travis were just trying to make sense  of what goes where and in what order and its chaos   travis like a sloth  matt a /none/ slow creature  laura or a slug  its starting to figure out that  this potion is gonna be a huge pain in my ass  laura sloth brain  matt sloth brain perfect  and a touch of something sweet for taste  laura peppermint  matt sugar that should work yeah  acridness to curl the tongue  laura acid  travis leech juice  marisha what does that mean   travis acrid what  acrid what the what does acrid mean  matt acridness to curl the tongue  travis acrid means um  laura /none/ sour  chris castor oil maybe  laura sardines  matt castor oil could work actually  the finishing touch must be sung  wheres the funny bone dust  chris bat wing powder  marisha oh ground humerus  chris want to start mixing em up  matt yeah mix a little bit in each one   chris okay tell me what  marisha wait wait  did we also get the spiders feast  matt funny bone that one there  chris whats next  matt we have the funny bone  the dragons breath just went /none/ in   we have the spiders feast now  which would be the  laura spiders eat flies  marisha or bugs yeah its  gotta be something buggy  laura oh what about this  coagulated blood of flies  all yeah yeah  chris coagulated blood of flies  putting it in there  ingredients pretty nasty  i hope we dont have to drink this  chris looks pretty tasty actually  laura drops of water now water  matt uh ink is next  the deep blackened sea nights stain   so put the /none/ ink in  laura octopuss ink  matt mind of beast lacking haste the sloth brain  marisha this is so foul looking  chris ugh god i feel like  tom cruise in cocktail  laura youre gonna eat this chris  matt touch of something sweet for taste  chris touch of something sweet  laura im putting in the peppermint   matt i dont see anything else that looks sweet  marisha im nervous about the dragons breath  a lot of the ingredients in these potions  can be easily switched out for other ingredients /none/   and thats making me really nervous  i dont want to make this potion 80 times   i really dont  matt its the sorrow of a fiery beast  you dont see like dragons tears or anything  travis dragons tears is over there  laura oh dragons tears  marisha oh yeah yeah yeah thats what we need  laura were putting in dragons tears  marisha dragons tears not dragons breath  chris theres pond slime is that acridness  matt acridness to curl the tongue  laura what is acridness  none of /none/ us have any idea what acrid means  laura what is acrid is it acidy   matt acidy bitter awful to the taste   apparently it means acidic hey brilliant   travis siri whats acridness mean  chris where are we uh  marisha i dont know what else it would be   laura acromantula or sardines or cod liver oil  chris oh i dont know uh  matt hornclump juice and pus yeah  chris i dont know guys  matt yknow what lets go ahead and  add the acromantula whatever it is /none/ to there   just fuck it  travis roll the dice buy the ticket  take the ride  chris okay adding acromancers venom  laura and then we sing  travis which one  matt its supposed to give us strength  laura is there one in there that  says something about strength  matt the finishing touch must be sung  laura grandmas sweat jenga  i know what thats from  laura acromantula or sardines  or cod liver oil  chris oh i dont know uh  matt hornclump juice and pus yeah  /none/ chris i dont know guys  matt yknow what lets go ahead  and add the acromantula whatever it is to there   just fuck it  travis roll the dice  buy the ticket take the ride  chris okay adding acromancers venom  laura and then we sing  travis which one  matt its supposed to give us strength  laura is there one in there that  says something about strength  matt the finishing touch must be sung  laura grandmas sweat jenga  i know what thats from  marisha does it have /none/ a  the finishing touch must be sung  we cannot get too literal but also  we want to make sure were literal enough   to where were not missing clues  marisha maybe its not literal hang on  that made me nervous that makes me really nervous  marisha maybe its another ingredient  matt oh sung we have vocal cords  i saw something here that was  marisha something oh ground vocal cords  laura thats it thats it  matt thank you   laura its going in ground vocal cords   /none/ marisha its in its in now what  chris should be working now   laura whos gonna drink it  chris revolted noise  travis are we drinking it  i wasnt 100 percent sure that  someone was supposed to drink it  marisha do we have to drink it  matt for someone to get the might  if no ones gonna do it im gonna fucking do it   im watching matt drink this and  im like i dont know if youre supposed to drink this  laura gross  ha ha he had /none/ to drink that  wasnt me  matt all right  chris okay you just drank that  for no reason didnt you  matt probably well well see if it works or not  laura pull out the sword from the stone  matt see if itll allow it no  i think the thing that went wrong  with this potion is um i have no idea  marisha which one what are we missing   matt it might be the acridness  i think we used maybe the wrong ingredient  one of the wrong ingredients /none/   maybe it was that acrid thing  marisha our public school educations  are failing us  chris actors are supposed to be  smarter than this  marisha do vinegar  matt adding vinegar to it  laura adding vinegar to the potion  we added vinegar  matt and everybody thats been  working on the potion solve it  chris hes gonna drink it again  he just drank it twice  matt oh thats terrifying  laura try it matt  he drinks it  travis offscreen nothing happens   sounds of frustration /none/  chris oh my gosh  laura is it because we added things  to it that shouldnt be in there  i havent really been helping much at this point  so i start looking around the room   for secret doors and things that i can pull  the candlesticks by the way  dont move but i tried all of them  laura oh this smells so bad now  it was not not good  chris can we find an hourglass something  marisha thats what im looking for  matt offscreen were pretty sure /none/ we have  all the right ingredients and we put them together   and were trying this out  but its still not working   were really frustrated so we began  to have to look at it even closer   and try and see if theres something  were missing in this specific dialogue  laura gain might  matt by mixing dust of funny bone  the sorrow of a fiery beast   the essence of a spiders feast  drops of water undeads bane   deep black and jenga stain  marisha /none/ drops of water undeads bane  theres two separate things  chris whats undeads bane  travis holy water right  matt holy water   laura the finishing touch must be sung  maybe we just have to sing it   ♪ im drinking this potion down ♪  marisha ♪ shes drinking a potion ♪  laura ♪ oh yeah and its disgusting ♪  this potion is foul im pretty sure  we put some wrong ingredients in there   because it made me want to puke  just a little bit  chris uh /none/ gain might to wrench from stone  by mixing dust of funny bone   the sorrow of a fiery beast  laura the sorrow is dragons tears  as were pouring through these various potion elements  i immediately remember that one of the spells   we have on the table immediately relates  to making something holy or blessed  matt oh here we go i got it i got it  for the holy water sorry   its part of the spells for it thats  im so dumb for not seeing that   /none/ to change water into something blessed  is a simple task do not feel pressed   simply raise the bottle to a light and chant  where do we have light   oh there  of course its matt who figures out  that you have to bless the holy water  laura right there right no here  matt benedictus aquaticus  travis speak for yourself brother  i love how exasperated he was in blessing it  hes like ugh i bless this holy water   and its now holy all right  can we /none/ move this along  matt we shall see  i want matt to be my priest all the time  laura okay wait now whats next  chris essence of a spiders feast  laura that was the coagulated blood  matt there you go  going to add a little bit of the ink here as well  marisha go go go  matt sloth brains   chris touch of something sweet for taste  matt thats going to be the peppermint  vinegar  laura now sing it and drink it matt  matt no we have /none/ to put the  ground vocal cords in there  chris doesnt say anything about drinking it  i just want to say that just out loud   travis yeah but he likes it  its his thing   matt all right mix that up   oh that is disgusting  were pretty sure we put all the pieces together  for this potion   weve got the holy water functional for us   matt offscreen but something isnt working still  no matter how hard we try and redo it  its not working /none/   thankfully marisha finds a note  laura in magic its not the song that matters  but the purity of the singing  marisha all right well jeez were fucked  matt ♪ i take responsibility for this failure ♪  i will say that for all the dread  and disappointment i was feeling in myself   through all that puzzle  matt oh thank you for the love of god  being able to finally finish that potion  reach over and pull that sword   from the stone was a moment of vindication /none/  hes so strong that matthew mercer  marisha what does it say  matt it has uh the sword doesnt say anything  i had to start wandering around the room  searching little things that   maybe havent been discovered yet  matt it has two notches on it  sounds of excitement  and i found a little scroll that  was hidden up on one of the shelves  cause hes tall and he can do that  at least i can contribute that way  travis travis is tall  laura travis is tall /none/ travis is tall  chris well this doesnt make any sense  yep its an order its coffee  so i realized theres probably more spell things  like that on the other bookshelf   so i start climbing on the furniture  to try to find it thats okay right  i remember in my tinkering  and searching the walls with my fingertips  travis hey you know theres  a little slit in that gold dragons mouth  a perfect swordsized slot  and so i said put the sword in the mouth  matt ahha /none/  laura ♪ im so short ♪  which he did  and nothing happened  travis can you turn it  can you turn the sword  and then he turned it  travis oh yeah whats up  matt we got a wand and a scroll  okay okay  marisha okay okay  chris and ive got these words  okay maybe these are all parts of a  laura a spell  chris all right weve got these  two fantastic words here  marisha is this the hourglass  chris this one came up from /none/ the top of the shelf  laura what is this  and lo and behold  travis yep scroll  i find the magical hourglass  laura i found it  reading scroll  marisha there it is  laura wait decode it  matt it looks like its upside down  i know were in trouble  we dont have a lot of time  travis i havent seen these  symbols before though  when the hourglass puzzle finally came about  i knew this was a challenge that i had to seek out  chris all right /none/ lets work on the bonus puzzle travis  i start looking in the nooks and crannies  and in one of the baseboards i find a note  matt theres another scroll here  that tells us that we have to  cast a spell with the wand that we found   good times  matt reading scroll  looking around i see that we have the wand  the spellbook we dont have the amulet   and im trying to think  where that could possibly be  matt looking for a magical amulet  marisha look /none/ for a magic amulet  matt yes a magic amulet  chris offscreen bonus puzzle  is just these scrambledup words  and then there are all these  little glyphs that you had to interpret  marisha what has my life become  laura wheres the necklace  matt offscreen i glance over  and start looking through some of the   potion materials on the shelf  and i can see this nice little square   sticking out of the top of one of  the large vasetype structures  matt oh is this the amulet /none/  yes the amulet we got it  laura okay the book of spells  okay now what  so once we have everything finally put together for this  i put it all on have my big harry potter moment  matt invertum illuminates  for each moment of this theres that little pause  and hoping that something happens   and more often than not it doesnt  and you get kind of sad  matt i dont know what that did  and there was that awkward pause  excited cheering  and the moment that /none/ the blacklight hits  and all the lines of arcane energy hit the wall  travis look over here  that is probably one of the coolest moments  that weve got to experience  travis look theres runes over here  lit lines appear on the back wall and  theyre connected to runes on one side and   theyre connected to a shelf with  all of these different items on the right side  and luckily as soon as that one lit up  we all kind of knew what was going on with that one /none/  matt okay so each of these corresponds to one of these runes  i turn around and theres like  disco lights on the wall and so much has happened   matts wearing an amulet and i dont  even have a clue of whats happened   in the last five minutes  marisha ill follow this line  just need to follow the lines  travis ill take the second one  laura i got this one  so we start trying to find  which line connects to which item  travis takes one of /none/ the lines and marisha  takes one of the lines so i take one of the lines   and were all tracing and following each other around  while not colliding with each other  its very strange  marisha number one is the feather  travis okay hold on im gonna  get this sheet and write on it  chris matt yours is going to  this right here this bell  laura the third one down is this cat  we rocked that one pretty hardcore  fuck the potion puzzle  i gotta say everyone /none/ fell into place  very quickly on that i was very excited  fuck the potion puzzle   blacklight puzzle though yeah  yeah all about that  travis so youre the first  marisha yeah   laura im the third   travis one two three  laura maybe we should write the symbols  chris hey guys ive almost got this   laura okay what is it  chris time whats this one  time something something focus balance   what are these   marisha its like a diamond with legs  chris /none/ arcana  laura arcana okay thats an r then  r r order  travis and the block is what  laura okay time arcana order  focus balance  chris philosophy and then theres this  marisha one two three four five six  as im starting to figure out that  each of these items have an individual number  matt so what do those correspond to  marisha right here look look look   im realizing the table across  the way from it also had all these correlating numbers  marisha here they are put /none/ them in order  matt what order should they be in  laura oh the cat is number three  at first i thought they might be related  to the tarot cards glad i didnt go that far  chris y s  laura this is two  marisha yeah   at this point were not sure quite how far along we are  and if this jenga storys going to come to fruition   laura four four is the rock  matt the compass and the w with the line  so its five  matt /none/ offscreen we get all these pieces and  we put them on the table in the proper sections   where the roman numerals on the wall  said that they were supposed to be placed  laura number one is the feather  number two is the matches   number three is the cat four is rock  five is chalice six is the last thing  matt the bell   once again that awkward tense moment hits  and i hear that click  matt did you hear that click  cheering  inside theres a /none/ little scroll  laura of course being the scroll hoarder   yanks it out  im a greedy code clue finder  and i had a habit of grabbing the little  golden blankets they were all placed on   and shaking it out cause you never know  these rooms are tricky bastard sorcerer  marisha guys we can do this   laura to banish evil conjoined be  arranged in banded geometry   once per soul chant the spell  until the evil sounds its death knell  this was probably the final spell /dung/  to finally banish this dark sorcerer   and complete this puzzle i hope  matt once per soul chant the spell  until the evil sounds its death knell   do we have a banishing spell in here   chris okay ive got the spell  solved the puzzle of course  i mean i knew i would  chris chronus additio  boom weve got five more minutes  matt fuck yeah chris  i mean i think i pretty much saved the game  hats off to him man he has proven himself  /none/ to be a very important member of this team   in spite of his own thoughts  laura conjoined be oh good  then you can see which one is the top and the bottom  matt read them all together  laura wait whats the top one  matt its this one here   laura dimisisti inimicum meum in tenebras  we have this spell that weve arranged  geometrically banded together   laura exteriores  and nothing happens the dread sinks deeper   matt okay to banish evil conjoined be  arranged in banded /none/ geometry once per soul   chant the spell we all have to do it in order  so you did it now marisha go  and we all start saying the spell   marisha dimisisti inimicum  we even have our wand out  we dont care if it works  travis meum in tenebras  we say the lines  chris exteriores  matt dimisisti inimicum  meum in tenebras exteriores  and  nothing  chris oh weve got some flickering lights  travis shit do we  i know we have the spell and  /none/ all the right pieces for it   i just dont think were doing it right   im completely confused cause ive spent  so much time trying to solve the additional puzzle  laura were we supposed to be in banded geometry  what does that mean in geometry   i dont honestly know whats happening right now  like it is completely confusing to me  matt okay banded geometry i would  imagine be putting them together but  conjoined be

evil sorcerer the whole time  disappointed groans  marisha did we fail  janet coming in the room was kind of the same feeling  i have when janet comes into the room usually   which is kind of depressing  janet times out  marisha nooo  if it was an option to kick her out of the room  i might have   and maybe held the door closed  hoping for some more time /none/   but apparently thats not a
