off vox machina had found themselves finishing up  dangling loose threads after they had completed the destruction of the chroma conclave and  /none/ essentially brought what seems to be for the time being peace to taldorei you helped keyleth  complete her aramente where she was crowned the voice of the tempest and you all had one wandering  thread of hotis the rakshasa which you have now killed twice and kept returning to the nine hells  to recoup and threaten to come and slay and you and everything you love in the near future so to  cut that off at the head you guys traveled to the second layer of hell the iron city of dis to hunt  down /none/ this rakshasa after signing a contract with a devil getting the proper information in this  regard of where it was within the bastion of flesh in the subterranean prison known as mentiri you  slaughtered a pit fiend named utugash and in response to that as part of the contract you  were given passage into this prison with your equipment you began a madcap rush through the  prison given the directions that you were presented as part of this deal you had made you  turned into a flock of bats rushed in with a new friend /none/ a dwarvish blood hunter a werebear  particularly the order of the lycan  laura hot  matt  named tova who you had discovered in utugashs lair you all as bats flew through  averted a number of blockades managed to just get the attention of a few devils that couldnt catch up  to you in time and basically the entire prison began to converge on you as you reached the  central area where this rakshasa was couple of scuffles in transition to that area you were  attacked by a large construct made of black chains /none/ from this lower area of the hell averting its  actual battle presence you systematically went through the doorways to discover the one that  housed hotis of which he was quickly destroyed while still in his larval reforming form by grog  you all battled through the swath of chains that were binding and pulling you back as you all  reached out to join hands in time for keyleth to pull out her tuned fork to the prime material  plane and cast plane shift and you all vanished into a familiar flash of whitishgreen light and  /none/ that is where we left off so picking up where we left off you all instantaneously feel the surge  of magical energy burst through your body and all the chains that had tightened around were  threatening to crush your limbs and tear your body into a mass of crushed flesh and blood release at  once and you have that familiar sense of floating and darkness once more and you see that single  bead of light ahead that grows larger and larger and larger and that light becomes omnipresent  almost in size a familiar grid of /none/ divine fire and light the divine gate ancient and placed by  the gods to seal both them the betrayer gods and any entities postdivergence away you transition  once more through this lattice impacting the searing warmth just barely cresting the exterior  of your form leaving no damage to your soul spirit or physical body but just enough to shake  you as you pass through one of these small porous holes in the gate itself glancing over your  shoulder you can see small little sparks that represent your friends who are traveling as well  through /none/ this planar tunnel as the lattice of the divine gate shifts and darkens behind you you see  a secondary small blue doorway come rocketing towards you all and suddenly your feet hit the  ground and as your eyes focus and look around you are in the late afternoon standing on the  dirt ground familiar scent of a crisp endofday whitestone afternoonevening you guys  are not at the sun tree you are by the southern portion of it not far from the farmhand who  commissioned your portrait jameson but the city is there before you the /dung/ streets arent cluttered  with people  laura not your portrait  sam i dont know who that is  matt well scanlan sorry were still getting over it  travis you know that guy that played at your fathers whatever  sam yeah  laura yeah  matt so as you all arrive touch down the familiar scent the smiles come over you knowing  that youve managed to successfully return to a comfortable homestead the sky is broken with  clouds but you can still see some of the dark blue behind it starting to turn purples and /none/  oranges as the sun though out of sight is hitting dusk a few people look over and glance  and you hear whispers as people begin to recognize your arrival with a flashy spark of light and that  slight terminatorlike slow rise from a crouch position as you all pull out of the other side of  the portal  travis sings terminator theme  matt yes  marisha yeah thats cool  laura and were all naked  marisha yeah yeah yeah yeah  taliesin where is john connor  liam have you seen this boy  /none/ travis no no no no no no no no  matt no youre fine youre all still clothed  travis fuuuu  laura all right i had this feeling i felt like we were not going to get here i felt like we were  going to show up somewhere else i dont know why  liam this is a sight better than the nine hells  travis could we have done that any closer to the razors edge im just saying  laura keyleth clutch  taliesin i think all things considered that went rather well taryon are you /none/ all right are you  all right  sam yes im fine  taliesin it is very reasonable not to be all right after that i think im going to need a  moment to sit down and have a drink  travis yep  laura i pop trinket out and i heal him  matt okay trinket pops out  laura hey were safe  taliesin i pull out a bottle of something  laura its good  matt and immediately goes from fierce bear to im hurting help me mommy  laura i know im going to do /none/ a spell buddy  matt guard laid down the bear is just rubbing against you  laura ive got a level three im going to do it at level three  matt okay the armor clinks and scrapes against you as the bits of fur which are matted with its  own blood slowly heal as you touch the soft caress your fingers across the bear fur  laura oh my god  laughter  taliesin did you fail a petting a  matt three ones  travis trip ones  matt you finish healing trinket somewhat  laura i /none/ think i wasnt even supposed to get three im only supposed to get two because its  a level three  travis well you still get two ones  laura whatever  matt did you not have a thirdlevel spell left  laura no i do have a 3rdlevel spell so its  matt so its at third level  laura oh yeah yeah okay  matt it works yeah youre fine so you finish healing the wounds close somewhat and trinket  goes questioning growl  laura im sorry i feel a little shaken up from that im sorry /none/ but you have some resting  you know  matt licks the side of your cheek and is like bear sounds there is one 13yearold kid off to  the side thats watching this whole thing go down and just goes is that your bear  laura it is why do you want to pet him  matt no  laura yes you do trinket go show some love  liam slow slow dont scare the boy  laura good happy love  matt the kids trying to back up hes like uh uh  laura i mean ooh  /none/ travis dont run dont run he attacks with his teeth if you run  matt uh  travis yeah freeze nose up let him see your nose hairs  matt you can see this scrawny boy is frozen in place and is partially trying to puff his chest  but also is you can see him fighting the instinct to just run  liam if you hum to him it soothes him  matt tentative humming this little young boy starts humming and its offkey but trinket  walks up  laura no there it is  matt you watch /none/ that moment the eyes just go open wide and white before slurps up the side of the  boys face  laura its good that you hummed it was really good it was good humming  matt and then trinket turns around and shoulder checks him and knocks him onto his ass and walks  back to you  travis good nose action  laura yep  marisha 30 seconds back in taldorei and were tormenting people  laura no no no he liked it it was sweet  marisha thats us thats good  travis yeah  taliesin this /none/ trip has changed us  travis human relations  marisha im not complaining i very much approve feels like old us  laura its nice not to hear screams of torment at all times  liam guys guys we have fuckall to do right now we have nothing to do  what do you want to do  taliesin well weve got a robot to reconstruct  travis what  laura oh tary  sam yes  travis oh  taliesin im going i will help with that ive got a very very large  laura are you all right /none/  sam im fine you know we adventurers lose people in battle all the time right and we have  a its nothing right its totally normal this happens all the time right  liam its actually quite painful and the hurt never goes away  taliesin i pass the last of the green tear whisky for dotty doty  sam no  taliesin for doty  laura laughs dotty dt dotye  sam no thank you im not i dont know i sighs hes i dont feel it would be right to  celebrate right now  taliesin this /none/ is not celebration  travis yeah how long did you have doohty  laura have you ever lost him before  sam no  laura im sorry  marisha have you lost anyone close to you before  sam no i havent  marisha well then you should know that thats not celebration  taliesin this is acknowledgement  liam thats right  sam all right  marisha this is coming to terms with a little bit of help  sam ill take a sip to doty my best friend  taliesin your oldest friend  sam my only friend /none/  taliesin not anymore  marisha to doty  taliesin your oldest friend not your only friend  travis to the thing  taliesin when youre ready well fix one up  sam it wont be the same i know it sounds silly but i created him and hes just mechanical but i  feel like he understood me better than anyone else  taliesin no thats not crazy  laura well he listened probably better than anyone else  sam but i could tell by his eyes that he sort of got it he understood maybe i was just /none/  projecting i dont know  taliesin even if you were its  sam i suppose i could build another it just wont feel the same i sighs  taliesin how else will you chronicle dotys adventures if not with a new chronicler  sam youre right  marisha exactly doty will live on in your stories  taliesin and well fill in everything thats been missed  sam yes youre right youre right yes with some resources and some time and a little help  maybe i can build a new doty  laura only when youre ready dear /none/  taliesin we definitely have resources time and help  liam and also dont need to party or anything but three cheers to you you just survived hell  and back  sam yes i did didnt i  laura was that on your list  sam hell was not but a revenge plot was  travis oh  laura nice  travis yeah  sam and this was a revenge so i think we can tick that off sighs  travis how does it feel being such an accomplished adventurer now  sam well ive been giving that a /none/ lot of thought actually in fact if you will humor me can i  read you all something  liam yes percy pass the bottle  taliesin drag the last of all the bottles out this time  sam if were honoring doty id love to read to you the last thing that he wrote well transcribed  before we went into the hells  laura im really excited to hear it  marisha thatd be beautiful  sam as sort of a memorial to him this was the last page before doty take this down he  always writes /none/ everything as i taryon darrington embark on a mission into the very  depths of hell i do so with no fear or hesitation though this undertaking is fraught  with peril i have a secret weapon that no inferno monster or hellhound can defeat i am  flanked by the ferocious band of mercenaries known as vox machina in the days since meeting this  ragtag company our relationship has blossomed at first i was viewed as a suspicious outsider then  as a gallant and trusted colleague and now having proven my mettle accepted as a lifelong  /dung/ brother and fullfledged teammate no matter what we face in the abyss my comrades would risk their  lives for me kill for me and im 100 sure each would gladly give his or her life to save mine  loyalty like that you cant put a price on it but if i had to id say their friendship is  worth about 210000 gold which even to me is a relatively large amount of money their faith  emboldens me  laughter  liam this is out of character  sam but its more than that ive started to /none/ wonder if i have so easily won the confidence of  these battledhardened titans perhaps i am even more venerable more impressive than i ever knew  perhaps after this mission i should return home newly confident to confront my father once and  for all maybe the time has come to complete my journey here and show my family that i am indeed  worthy to carry the darrington name but first revenge soon we will venture to where nightmares  are born and its going to be fun fun fun thats all for now doty as always correct /none/ my  grammatical errors before you rest and go fetch my sleep mask and nightshirt  and then we went to hell  laura that was beautiful that was  taliesin eloquent very eloquent  sam he was a special special robot and  laura yes  sam  he was there for me in all of my darkest times and lightest times and now that hes not  there anymore i just i should feel very lonely but i dont because i am surrounded by  people who truly respect me for who i am and i know that /none/ in that last night before we went to the  hells i wrote that i was ready finally to go back and confront my father but now in the  absence of doty ive decided to put that aside and stay with you all yes i feel my place is  here with you my rightful place i wont have access to as much money but everything else about  me will stay the same and i know that you are all happy that ive made this decision to stay with  you as a nowpoor adventurer so maybe this /none/ is worth celebrating i dont know should we go have  a drink in a pub or something  liam yes we should  taliesin we should yes  liam yes we should  marisha definitely  travis i have a question what is a sleep mask  sam i dont like seeing lights at night it wakes me out of my dream state so  travis does it go over your whole head  sam just my eyes and nose just the top of the nose  laura just the smallest of questions though the amount that you wrote /none/ down would we be seeing  that before you cut off ties  sam i dont think we should venture up there right now  laura right yeah  sam we have adventuring to do dont we things to help rebuild and  laura i mean we may be here for a while  taliesin we may be taking a bit of a break  liam it was a funny moment in time when you met us taryon  sam yes  liam we had a bit of a list weve had a couple lists and weve checked an awful /none/ lot off of them  and were real tired were thinking of taking it easy for a bit  laura wouldnt it be fun though to just set up shop here and hang out  liam tinker design  marisha you could repair things for small change on the side  laura yeah yeah yeah thats how you could make some money maybe tinker for a living  sam sure i mean i havent tinkered for money before do you get what two three thousand gold  per little  taliesin a year yes  sam per year  laura /none/ yeah thereabouts  taliesin well tinkering to be fair i dont actually know what tinkering pays because ive  never been paid to do it  sam is there anything that pays much much more than that  marisha being a hero and adventuring or being born into privilege  laura a lot of money  taliesin a lot of money  sam but you know what im ready to set aside money for now and just live my life and be my own  man because if i do when i do eventually go home i dont want to /none/ seem like im trying to  prove something to him i just want to be my own man right and have him accept me for that like  you all have  taliesin well i mean yes  travis i know theres a lot of money in being a man whore  sam a man whore  travis yeah sell your body you know put that hair to good use  laura that is true taryon  travis start making some coin  laura you are a pretty boy  liam its true  sam my hair  taliesin you /none/ dont actually have to listen to a man who needed an eye mask  explained to him but  sam who will brush my hair at night  taliesin well thats a conundrum  laura well you know you could make a new doty maybe a smaller doty just to brush hair  sam yes i will will you help me  taliesin yes of course  marisha plus you know if youre wanting to become a more independent and solitary man then  maybe you learn how to brush your own hair  sam as always wise words keyleth /tavern/  marisha thank you  taliesin hell has done something to you  liam also we feel very badly about doty obviously and i hope that you can build a  replacement but in all the years that you were with him did you ever have a sweetheart or an  acquaintance even  sam nothing to speak of  liam i mean if you can push yourself to go to the nine hells you can go out to a tavern with us  and meet people  laura thats right get a little funsy action there  sam are /none/ you talking about intercourse  taliesin well at the very least were talking about advanced flirting at the very least  laura yeah yeah thats good  marisha courtship and vax over here is a great wingman get it because hes  sam i could try that out sure yeah thats a great idea yes  travis try that out  marisha thank you  liam do you this is forward do you go rogue or ranger or taco or hot dog or  sam i do not understand what you are saying  taliesin i suppose if theres liquor /none/ we could find out  sam rogue or ranger  travis you know what were going to find out right lets just roll the dice  and see where they fall  liam weve got to teach you some slang buddy youve got to learn some slang  sam all right all right yes lets go  laura no but seriously though the money situation though like really you are paying  travis its okay its okay  laura no but you know you always said you pay your debts and all that so you have some so i  /none/ just wanted to make sure that thats actually happening  liam maybe we could get to that tomorrow  laura no because i feel really bad for you i feel bad about everything and im pretty happy  for you for being your own man and all of that i just want to make sure that  sam no its fine i could probably figure out how much i currently have its just doty used to  keep track of that for me  laura i can keep track of it for you gladly  liam can i insight him /none/ to see if this is bullshit or legitimate tears  matt sure  liam im outta luck too hold on hold on  taliesin thats so exciting  sam do i have to roll against it  matt just roll just roll  liam oh its terrible  sam this is worse  travis no theres no way  laura doubtful what did you get  sam this is three  liam five  sam what are we rolling  laura wait what did you add what did you add to him  matt persuasion if youre honest deception if /none/ youre not dont tell me which one it is  liam but then tell the number  sam oh five  laura five and five what does that mean  matt five and five it meets the dc so tell him  sam i have 34000 gold pieces  laura i thought you said you had a lot of money  laughter  marisha she said out of accent appalled  laura because im completely out of character  liam wheres my money taryon  marisha shes so incensed she dropped accent  laura okay no no i wasnt vex /none/ then  marisha yeah  matt so vax heres how it works in character vax you get the sense that  liam wait wait wait vex or vax  matt vax because youre the one who read this as all this is happening you get the sense that  maybe hes not currently worth as much as he leads on  liam i was also curious if the tears felt like crocodile tears or  sam oh just at that last moment  liam yeah yeah were you really like  sam i just didnt want to tell her how /tavern/ money i have  liam right so its bullshit  sam  but before im genuinely sad about doty  liam absolutely but in this moment a little bullshitty  matt in this moment a little bullshitty i think  sam yes  laura i didnt read any of that  liam we can talk about this tomorrow lets just go get him drunk hell probably tell you if hes  drunk im sorry youre right in front of me lets go have a drink  marisha are we still in the middle of farmlands or are we walking  /town/ matt you guys are in the street so youre slowly walking through the streets of whitestone  marisha all right okay  matt if youre looking for a pub in particular the one you usually go to is the tipsy quorum if  thats where youre going to get a drink  laura thats my favorite  travis i always forget the name  marisha old faithful  taliesin its the best bars where you always forget the name isnt it  travis yep  laura yeah  matt on the way because this is on the more northern side /town/ northeastern side of whitestone  you do see there is a crowd of people what looks to be a caravan is being packed up there are a  number of carts and horses and things are being loaded up for what looks to be some sort of a  fairly large travel pack of people you do hear the laughter of children coming from the right of  you and then pushing through the crowd you see odessa illya and gren taldorei the children  go running past as theyre being chased by two aasimar boys blue skin running past /none/ them and  theyre giving a joking chase tickle and all of a sudden one of the kids comes around with a stick  and he stops and puts his hands up and they all look over and see you guys and immediately get  sheepish with their hands to the side you see kyor nods and hunin nods the kids go running off  again not really paying attention to you guys  laura well go get em  matt uhhuh they both continue off after the kids just as salda taldorei walks up from between  some of /none/ the pale guard that are currently helping load things onto these carts and she sees you  all and comes forth oh my goodness its so great to see you all safe and sound  taliesin your majesty  marisha hello  matt the last few times youve seen her shes looked a little frazzled but still with what  remains of her formal attire which she had on her after the attack on taldorei right now shes  dressed very simply you wouldnt be able to tell her from most of the regular casual farmfolk and  you would /none/ have no instinct of the noble lifestyle that she comes from and it suits her well she smiles  and greets and gives a respectful bow so were heading back to emon  laura theyll be happy to have you  matt its been a while and now that things have calmed down and from what weve heard that youve  all saved the city i guess were going to bring the children back to their home were going to be  taking the parchwood way to the silvercut roadway and we have guardians we have people weve hired  /none/ or have agreed to come along and keep us safe the children have taken a shine to the boys as if you  havent noticed if its all right were thinking of bringing them with us  laura thats wonderful  marisha its very kind of you  taliesin quite gracious  matt we have the alabaster lyceum once its up and running again of course and i know the  headmaster there we can provide a good education for the boys which upon talking with them i  think theyre both in dire need of  laura do you /none/ need any help with that we feel a bit of responsibility for them  matt really its fine you guys have done enough anyway and to be honest i believe your  sister needs your help here more than we could on the journey there  liam do your kids holding up okay  matt yeah weve done as best as we could to shield them from the brunt of the past few months  but things are cheerier here definitely and i think theyve  taken that upon themselves as well  marisha just be prepared the emon you /none/ left isnt necessarily the emon youll be returning to its  getting better but it takes time  matt i can assure you that my memory of the place at least the moments before we left  couldnt be any more dire than we could return to any semblance of calm at our home is welcome  but and she glances over i think odessa has a crush on hunin i dont want to break her heart  by keeping them too far away so thats  liam cool mom  matt anyway i think were preparing to set out /none/ first thing in the morning and i just want to say  thank you for everything  laura any time sorry we couldnt do more  matt youve done plenty i do hope to see you if you decide to still be a part of the council  satellite or not  laura grayskull is still there  matt well i mean the children shouldnt be too far then anyway i should go catch up to them  its good to see you all  taliesin its good to see you as well  matt she glances over at you /none/ with a curious look  sam good day  matt good day  taliesin hes new but hes proving himself quite well  marisha hes fine  sam i just lost my best friend  marisha hes fine  matt im sorry to hear that thats terrible i understand the difficulty of loss  believe you me  sam does it get better  matt it does with people like this around you people like them around me it does  sam thank you kind stranger  matt you as well kind stranger she continues walking on and catches up /none/ with the kids  sam she seems neat  taliesin yes neat neat would be the word i would she does all right  marisha thats the most awkward postconversation conversation i have ever had  laura yeah yeah thats pretty awkward  taliesin well theres a pub over there  laura lets go get him laid  taliesin do i see a soldier of any kind on this  matt oh yeah theres a number of pale guard that have been assigned to this caravan that are  helping put things onto the various carts  taliesin im just /tavern/ tapping one when youre done please let the palace know that we have returned  matt oh yes of course sir it will be done  taliesin weve returned for good for a while so no immediate threat anymore  travis we went to hell  matt i will do this i will do this immediately  marisha yells well be in the pub  laughter  matt right he finishes putting one of the last bags up and then starts making his way up towards  castle whitestone you guys continue your foot journey over to the tavern  /tavern/ laura i get on my broom and continue the journey  liam had a little too much of percys hooch whats the matter  matt as you guys start making your way towards the tavern you hear a series of heavy metallic  footfalls behind you with accelerated pace quickening quickening and you glance over your  shoulder and rushing from the caravan apparently in the process of helping it being set up and part  of the party that brought or is spearheading the organization of this caravan you see a small  gnomish cleric in plate armor  /none/ cheering  ashley hello  matt come on in  liam shes back baby shes back  ashley ah hello everybody  matt this is in character by the way  marisha how was traffic  ashley oh hi oh just so terrible  marisha with the caravan  ashley hello everybody  laura hi  ashley hi  matt so pike having come along as youve been helping out with the reconstruction effort in emon  and was notified that some of the remaining royals of the family of the sovereign were going to make  their way towards /none/ emon the least you could do was be a part of that so you ushered a number of the  travel carts that were intended for this part of the caravan since whitestone had to maintain most  of their hardware within the city to remain functional and you just arrived in the city a few  days ago and as youve been helping these people prepare and organize the whole endeavor you just  watch vox machina your family walk by and start making their way towards one of the taverns just  as the suns setting and you /none/ rush up to catch up with them  ashley hey hey youre just going to walk by  laura we didnt even see you oh my god  ashley oh hi oh hey hey  travis oh man pike look look who it is  ashley hi hello taryon  sam hello pike  ashley hello  sam hello hello  marisha were so sorry we know you really wanted to go to

feel like maybe it wouldnt have been good  travis like what like you would have gone dark pike or something  laura it probably would have been like you would have gone evilevil  ashley maybe i feel like it /none/ would have affected me in certain ways or you know  i just dont know  marisha it was very hot  travis thats not a risk we want to take  ashley no its probably safe that i didnt  laura

man  laura rejection rejection rejection  matt the /tavern/ best montage ever  taliesin roll for montage  marisha roll for montage  matt as you guys make your way into the tipsy quorum the warm interior is comfortable to you  guys you recall most of it as most of the time youve spent in there has been in various states  of intoxication theres a beautiful hearth on the north end of the complex i say complex because  its a series of rooms theres the main tavern area in which the drinking happens theres a  small eating area thats separate from that so they keep /tavern/ the localized tavern central area on its  own theres a kitchen an open kitchen so all the smoke and the food smell comes just barreling  through its pretty sparse mainly because a lot of the people are in the process of helping with  the tavern or they just havent quite hit that point in the evening dusk is when people start  finishing their work for the day and they usually come in in the next couple hours or so but you do  see a couple of the pale guard are currently just taking a break /tavern/ theres a handful of farmhands  that are just in there finishing a small breakfast and having some drinks theres the  bartender and a few bar handlers a barmaid just waiting for customers to come in and as you  enter immediately she goes from leaning on the back wall oh hah sorry and she comes up and  shows you guys to any table you like  laura what does she look like  matt she looks late 40s probably had a few kids shes not unattractive shes not going to be  blowing anyones mind per se /none/ shes a working woman shes confident it seems and she knows  her job shes a lady  laura youve got a good shot over there with that  travis loudly do you have food and drink in this establishment  laura

the meantime you guys come up to the bartender a few drinks are brought by the woman  comes up again and lays out tankards and glass whatevers available its not a very fine  establishment its whatevers functional so some of them are more claybased mugs some are metal  whats up  liam oh i said its perfect for us  matt yeah it works out great for you guys its a motley of various containers all the drinks are  scattered across the table all right /none/ your turkey legs should be ready in the next oh  whenever theyre ready i guess  travis oh you are too kind and a beauty to boot by the way do you happen to have weve  just come back from a very intense battle do you happen to have a needle and thread  matt why whatever for  travis my darling its because im so ripped  matt she cant

going to hate all of them  taliesin god i hope so  laughter  matt about 15 minutes go by and you guys are having a conversation youre catching pike up  with what you guys have been doing in the city of dis and all the chaos and in the middle of  telling /none/ an incredible story about how you ran into tova right as you get to that point all of a  sudden plates clanging at the table and you can see these beautiful turkey legs fresh out of the  oven theyre still sizzling on the outside she says careful now theyre hot do you need  another drink anyone else  travis yep yep i need another drink dont you  sam clears throat yes  liam you dont even need to ask that again the whole night  sam excuse excuse excuse me  matt good to know  /none/ sam madam if i may hi my name is taryon taryon darrington  matt hi taryon  sam its lovely to meet you im ashamed of something and i wanted to tell you about it my  friend over there the big one pointed you out to me and said look at that beautiful girl across  the room and im ashamed that he had that moment of seeing you before i did for knowing that he  got to experience that beauty for a moment longer than i why its almost enough to make me cry  ive read /none/ many books but your hair could fill a novel with its beauty your eyes are sonnets your  nose and mouth epic poems and almost almost any feature of you could be enough to live a life on  but im afraid its your neck that got me the subtle curve the way it meets your chest just so  its like a wave crashing on a beach at the same time ferocious and peaceful i want to go to that  beach i want to swim in that tide i want to dip my toes in that water and /none/ experience it for  myself  liam this is legit the twins over here  marisha yeah  matt theres definitely a long pause

off join us for a bit  im sure your legs are super tired  matt i have about 30 minutes or so before the rest of this place fills up /none/ with folks far less  interesting than you so unfortunately ive got to be ready for the rush your words are sweet and  flowery but i think i may be a little old for you sonny slides the drink back  laura ooh she got some experience  marisha roll for restraining order  laughter  travis man i can just picture the spot in my bag of holding that that rod is going to go into  sam i dont think thats a clear win  travis yep  taliesin thats not a clear

listen honey if youre /none/  looking to go ahead and find yourself an evening wait here about 30 minutes ill introduce you to  someone and she releases your shoulder and goes back to work  taliesin this is also why you always make friends with women they have friends theres just  networks of them its brilliant  liam that is some of the best advice ive ever heard leave your mouth  taliesin thank

who go to  bed with older men  taliesin do you know why because /none/ those adventurers are busy actually having a good time  liam has anything youve gone through with us been like the books youve read  sam no its much grosser in real life and more terrifying and so badly planned  laughter  sam every book you read is tactical geniuses and strategy for days but we just go in with nothing  nothing at all no backup plan no exit strategy  marisha and why do you think that would be any different than our dating strategy  laura terrible  liam everything youve read about romance well thats /none/ horseshit  laura we should find lawrence we should see if we can find him  sam hes probably dead  laura we should scry on him  marisha do you have a reminder of him any items  sam no  laura nothing can you describe him would it work  sam he was tall he was fairskinned he was strong  liam since were friends now and youre learning about us what does your father do that you  suspect he killed this poor man  sam real estate  laura real estate  liam hes a land /none/ baron  taliesin never trust a man who sells property  sam real estate he buys and sells properties mostly buys and holds leases them back to the  kingdom who sold it to him for a huge markup and charges taxes on people that use the properties  exorbitant taxes and he shakes down people who use his properties its all very shady and murky  but it all involves real estate  laura you dont want to be that  liam do you like your father  sam hes a great man hes made a lot of money /none/ and hes respected and feared by many  taliesin we just killed a dragon that made a lot of money  liam do you like your father  sam i hate him more than anything  marisha then why do you feel like you need to impress him  sam

or slightly wealthy theres worse things than poverty  marisha theres more to respect and honor than just money a lot more in fact generally money  tends to make you  liam miserable  marisha shittier  laura i dont fully agree with that  taliesin i dont fully agree with that either although i spent quite a bit /none/ of time before i met  this group of people dirt poor beggar poor it wasnt the best time of my life but i dont  remember my point it was actually pretty awful  liam i think if were going to bring up how you shat on money when we first met you and talked  about how it was pointless and didnt bring you happiness  taliesin its true i did say it was pointless  laura you did give it away  taliesin and because it comes with an enormous amount of responsibility and complications and  /none/ while its nice to have because im using it to do some good in the world now and because without  it she becomes slightly more questionably evil than she currently is bless  liam shes so evil  taliesin its not the secret to happiness it doesnt actually help if youre not already happy  it can augment existing happiness it just doesnt create it from scratch  marisha i feel like were suddenly talking about your problems  taliesin or baking bread im not sure  marisha still your problems yeah  taliesin im going to drink more /none/  travis tary did you want to get laid tonight  sam no thank

chance for you to go to the big time  /none/ taliesin maybe take some pressure off and practice talking normally to people who are going  to be very gentle with you about the whole process  sam talking  ashley you dont even have to do anything you can just have an hour of their time  sam pike are you encouraging me to go to a brothel right now  ashley listen i do think that going to as you put it a house of flesh is a part of being an  adventurer its a rite of passage  laura do you go to brothels pike  /none/ ashley well where do you think i go when you guys leave all the time  laughter  travis pike is crushing it  taliesin i missed you so much  marisha then why did we get mimosas and go shopping when we had our girls day  ashley say again  marisha why did we get mimosas and just go shopping on our girls day i feel like we got  robbed  ashley well those are so fun too  travis dont go shopping next time i never do  matt vax and vex as you guys are /tavern/ having this conversation you notice that shaunas in the  progress of conversing with a figure at the bar who sat down not too long ago you can only see  from the back but you see a set of armor that is pale guardspecific they have a brief  conversation and the figure turns around and begins to approach the table after glancing over  the shoulder a few times towards where you guys are sitting as you guys are talking from behind  taryon a large figure looms up from behind and smiles as you guys recognize with /none/ the brunette  hair pulled back into a tight bun behind the healing scar on the face you see tricia one of  the pale guard  travis yeah she beat me at arm wrestling  laura trish the dish  marisha totally trish the dish  matt as she walks up and leans and touches the edge of your shoulder pats you and

down on the table in front  taliesin or youll just have a great time  matt pours a really thick amberlike liquid into each of these slams the drink down pulls her bun  out her hair curled up and crimped from being put up falls around the shoulder  sam coughs  travis do not puke do not puke  sam nope nope /none/  laura youre doing great  sam whats your name  matt shauna were taking the bottle

 taliesin im appealing beyond the voice of the tempest to the heart of the storm im asking the  heart of the storm pleading to the heart of the storm far beyond the voice of the tempest theres  nothing to be heard here  marisha lalala the voice is very /tavern/ loud right now sorry the voice cannot hear you the voice  is going to have to take a message  laura you could always try following

the scrying eye  taliesin does it require attunement  matt the scrying /none/ eye does not require attunement no it gives the ability to use the scry spell  once per day  marisha see what you can do  taliesin im going to try and use it  matt just for the sake of this im going to have you roll a d20 and add your intelligence  modifier  marisha if he crits im going to be so pissed  taliesin can i use a resolve for this  matt resolve is for a saving throw right  taliesin no that doesnt work does it thats seven  matt seven you /none/ take a moment and glance into it instead of thinking of the magical orientation of  the ritual your brain immediately goes to the mechanical structure of what this would do how  would you recreate the scrying spell in a mechanical fashion where it wouldnt require  magic youre eventually at the point where i dont understand this  taliesin i dont understand how this works never mind  marisha really are you sure you have to think real hard about buttnaked tary real hard  taliesin one more time just bring the difficulty up i dont care  /none/ matt yeah the dc is definitely higher go ahead and roll again  marisha tan lines where his armor used to be  liam luscious hair  taliesin there we go 24  and im thinking about scanlan  laura gasps oh you sneaky fuck  matt okay  taliesin do you want to say this out loud  matt you know what guys if i could

the second time in a week ive gotten to do this to people  sam oh wow the reverse whisper  matt as you concentrate percival your vision clarifies and you see the moonlight over the tops  of the trees of the /town/ parchwood forest around whitestone the clouds break your vision  transitions and all of a sudden youre thrust forward at a magnificent speed beyond the forest  and now youre not too far but south of the parchwood the trees disperse and youre now  looking at a cluster of buildings maybe a few hundred small structures ranging from homesteads  to hovels you smash cut once more and there you see a campfire you see a campfire set up maybe  about 25 feet between two buildings in this open fire pit area its a central bonfiretype social  /none/ gathering place and there you see a number of wooden logs set up like stools or seats and in  the moonlight and a few nearby torches you see about six or so simple farm folk that are all  sitting around this bonfire except its not six its four farm folk and you see sitting amongst  them kaylie and scanlan theyre both together playing music for these people who are all sitting  and staring into the fire at the end of their work day its a very simple very serene scene  strangely theyre just sitting with /town/ simple folk in a simple town you recognize it now this is  the turst fields youve been through here once before when you were first leaving whitestone and  heading south to find your quarry all that time ago this is definitely a more rural area and  they dont seem to be in any danger and they dont seem to be at any caper but theyre both at  the center of doing what they both do best  which is entertain  taliesin do they look reasonable  matt they look reasonable youve seen them perform before /town/ and there is a performance face  theyre both wide smiles everyone else seems to be enthralled by the music or enthralled by the  flames and the music combination a couple of people saunter up and plop down on the ground  sitting next to them to join in and theyre drawing a small crowd at the end of the day  taliesin i take down as many details in my head as i can  matt okay bring them back in guys get back

ago  taliesin thats fair hes doing very well  liam all right  taliesin very well im very proud  travis so question do we crash here for the night or do we make it back to the hiccup  castle  taliesin

morning we hiccup oh god i got so much burps then in the morning we  can head back out  taliesin head back out where  travis to /tavern/ the hiccup castle  sam those are real hiccups arent they

her have her fun  laura i agree with that sentiment thank you for your generosity and your connections  travis silver tongued huh  laura also im sorry for my friends and for me  laughter  matt at that

points to most of the other /tavern/ tables its fine  laura thank you  matt she gets back to work  laura i dunno i think he might be with her a long time he might be learning a few things it  could

the few lights that are up in the sconces on the  secondary floor as you make your way towards your sisters chambers you come to the door and her  personal guard is there in pale guard armor as soon as you begin to approach the steps gets into  a defensive position and then recognizes you and steps back and leads you in as you come inside  you see cassandra is currently in her regular daytoday clothing one of her many outfits she  /none/ uses for formal meetings her hair is a little frazzled and down in front of her face she has a  stack of sheets stacked up next to her at this small desk table that she has in front of one of her  large red velvet sitting chairs however shes not looking at that right now as shes currently  enthralled with what looks to be a small stack of cakes and a little tea saucer shes holding up as  shes sipping  taliesin theres just layers to that trouble isnt there just layers of paperwork  matt /none/ she turns back and looks at you you see a little bit of the cake curl at the edge of her  mouth percival takes another sip of the tea and sets it down youve returned  taliesin for a while this time  matt how have your travels been  taliesin terrible but all over  matt that sounds par for the course i assume  taliesin im back to help its my turn  matt good as the sophist of native ingenuity you have much responsibility in this time of  recovery and im

ive forgotten we  have not had any purveyor of the grey hunt  taliesin quite a while a long while  matt so vexahlia  taliesin it seemed appropriate even before things became what they are yes  matt before we can officiate that she has to undergo the hunt itself  taliesin yes  matt i dont know how that works  taliesin i  matt keeper yennen might  taliesin he does if i recall  matt keeper yennen

to cassandra your sister and she leans forward and takes your hand and  goes im so very tired ive missed you i need your help please  taliesin were going to make this right were going to the machine

functional as it can be were having to ration ammunition as we have to rely on you for  that and youve been gone  taliesin well were going to fix that as well  /none/ matt perhaps you should helm most of that training since the majority effort has been at the  hip and making things up as they go  taliesin the guards the captain of the guards has been taking care of everything  matt yes yes we lost a few in the last altercations but we have a good long standing  number of individuals who have stepped up and what was his name the one that you brought in  taliesin jarett  matt jarett  taliesin is

responsibilities and the necessity of the hunt  taliesin i will thank you  matt of course she leans back in her chair and sighs i think its time for bed and she /none/ gets  up and she goes and closes off the fireplace in the corner and throws a little bit of water onto  it and puts out the candles in the room  taliesin im going to run by jaretts on the way back to my quarters  laura i ran to jareds  marisha and matt sing it can only be jareds  matt jarett jarett doesnt stay in the castle jarett currently stays down in the barracks within  the city of whitestone proper because hes responsible for training the recruits and helping  build up their skills /none/  taliesin all right real quick im just going to write a little post im just going to write a  little letter which i will

needs more  matt okay hes a smart man hes done different forms of business he can let you know if you need  to restock the coffers if you will so the letters written up assuredly delivered and the  evening comes to a close for you guys at the tavern here at the tipsy quorum we have pike and  /tavern/ grog catching up on crazy business amongst the rest of the jovial atmosphere of the tavern as  people have been drinking heavily into the evening like a city that is still recovering from five  years of perpetual torment does  ashley but its just like shes so pretty with like a feather in her hair  travis i know shes like a bitch but in a furious way  ashley i know and shes really good with money  travis i know and if she gives you the eyebrow and then youre like  ashley i know and /none/

ashley yeah  travis let the river take you where it will  ashley well im tired now i said earlier i wasnt tired but i do get tired  travis yeah i do too i mean its probably because youve been crying

much of it  /tavern/ travis i dont know  laughter  matt as grog passes out at the table next to you you look up and at this point notice that most of  the tavern is now empty and you have no idea what hour it is but it seems pretty late and pretty  empty you glance over and as the tavern is still open it doesnt really close per se but the  night shift you see shaunas finishing shes throwing a shawl over shes getting ready to  leave she looks over and sees you and takes off her shawl /none/ and throws it around grog  ashley thanks  matt and goes take care of him  ashley i will hes fine  matt hes

aw and with that the night comes to a close the next morning the sun rises those who  are staying in the castle you rise to the familiar smell of early breakfast meats eggs  other classic meals being prepared for the various guard of the castle and those who belong to the  chamber of whitestone as it currently stands as you /dung/ all begin to convene down there the two of  you come to consciousness as two giant glasses of water are slammed on the table from a morning  shauna arriving drags the shawl out from under grogs head which is now damp with just a  multitude of drool that has just seeped into it she squeezes it out and  sets it on the side of the bar  travis somebody left that there  ashley i wasnt up yet to fix it  matt its fine its fine  travis its fine  matt as she starts /tavern/ getting ready and a couple of the other bar hands start setting up the tavern  you hear footfalls come rushing down and you watch as trisha comes rushing down putting on her armor  real fast shes going shit shit im late shit shit shit and just rushes out the door  ashley oh shes still she stayed the whole night  travis yeah do you  ashley thats a good thats a good sign right  travis yeah  ashley sorry  travis jerky  ashley chicken pot pie  laughter  matt about five minutes more you /tavern/ see the slow footfalls of taryon derrington make his way down  the stairs into the empty tavern early morning its maybe 8am at this point you can just hear  the birds going on the outside the blearing suns beginning to crest over the mountains  travis we got alcohol sweats  matt yeah nah you guys are pretty hung over at this point  ashley just so thirsty  sam oh you there hello youre still here  ashley we just waited just in case  sam i have a headache oof rough night huh  ashley how /none/ do you it was rough how do you feel  laughter  sam i i feel good different better  ashley you feel different  sam i feel wow that trish is shes a lot of woman howd you guys do  travis oh enough about us  ashley great meal great company  travis yep  ashley great night  sam yeah it was something else i mean theres periods that i dont really remember but she was  aggressive when she needed to be and gentle when she needed to be and ive read a lot about  /none/ that and a lot of things ive read were true i mean the female form is mysterious and strange  and there are curves and  ashley so many curves  sam smells and  travis tary you didnt just give each other massages all night did you  sam oh no  travis oh good  ashley details details laughs do we need mimosas  sam i i have experienced the pleasures of the flesh i have now known a woman it was  outrageous i didnt really know what i was doing but she guided me sometimes by /dung/ force  ashley okay  sam but she was also gentle sometimes and i get it now i see the appeal i understand women are  soft and tender and clears throat  they are not for me  laughter  sam i mean there are so many holes and you dont know which one is the right one  ashley you know it just depends on the day i guess  travis yeah it can be confusing especially in the dark right  sam she was so strong and i was so scared and i really think vomiting noises /none/  laughter  travis oh no  matt make a constitution saving throw grog  travis thats a 16  matt youre okay  ashley okay you know what this is what adventurers do and you did it  sam no i see that i see how people would find that  travis i feel like we need to commemorate this youre not the same man you were when we last saw  you last night  ashley look at that face youve seen things  sam theyre so intricate and soft and i just feel like i think i /none/ know what i like now and that was  a worthy endeavor and thank you pike for encouraging it and grog for setting me up  ashley without a shadow of a doubt now you know  sam i know for sure 100 i am not going to do that ever again with anyone like her or anyone  similar  travis should we go get tattoos or get you a new haircut or something to commemorate this  sam no my body is a temple and i wouldnt sully it like that  travis its a temple  laughter /none/  travis well all right  ashley lets get back did you get to sleep at all do you need sleep  sam when she was finished with me she let me curl into a ball  travis laughs did you cast sanctuary  laughter  sam there was a valley between her pecs her breasts i guess and there was a nice little  resting place right there that i laid my head for the night and she draped her arms over me and  they were like big sweaty blankets and i needed to get up to pee /none/ in the middle of the night but i  couldnt so i just held it  liam mercy  sam it was like being attacked by a bear have you seen the departed  laughter  sam lets go get cleaned up  taliesin and its over  liam not the chapter of the story we were expecting  laughter  matt is it ever ive actually been privy to this exact conversation with a few guys who found out the  same way in high school nope not for me oh my god thats amazing  liam my face /none/ feels like its on fire  marisha yeah i feel really pink  matt as you guys are eating breakfast and cassandra makes her way down joins you all and  begins the meal her personal bodyguard is looking exhausted and frustrated and tapping the toe  eventually you watch as a new guard comes in and im so sorry and they switch out and the new  personal bodyguard of cassandra is trisha who stops and sets up and apologizes to cassandra  then turns and gets into guard duty and sees the rest of you eating breakfast and /none/ goes  travis yo  matt good morning  marisha good morning  matt as you guys now approach and walk in about 20 minutes later after this whole conversation  you guys have cleaned up and made your way she says nothing else and is now like oh boy  ashley oh you were just  marisha oh thats why youre being so quiet oh  matt after you guys have had a meal and you guys have made your way and had this bit of  interaction where shes like shushes cassandra comes over and sits facing you /none/  vexahlia  marisha cassandra shushes  matt all right lady vexahlia me and percival had a conversation last night and its come to my  attention that youve been granted a title here within whitestone  laura yes  matt a title that has been unfulfilled for quite some time and i for one being the figurehead of  the city i wish to welcome you as a member of our chamber as the grand mistress of the grey hunt  do you understand the responsibilities  laura i have no idea of the responsibilities in fact i have /none/ no idea what being a lady really  means except for saying im a lady every once in a while  matt to be perfectly honest it means very little  laura oh  matt i can say that from experience it means people look at you and expect you to have the  answer and you  laura have all the answers  matt she leans in and goes and youre really just making it up best you can but you do your  best but as the grand mistress of the grey hunt upon the completion of the /none/ grey hunt you are  responsible for overseeing local diplomacy and rooting out mundane and supernatural dangers  throughout the surrounding parchwood  laura all right  matt to protect the citizens of whitestone  laura so im like a guard  taliesin oh no more of a what would be the word i would think to use  marisha vanquisher  laura destroyer of worlds  marisha ooh yeah decimator of beasts  matt you will be eventually training and be granted a cadre of people beneath you as part of  the grey hunt who you will train /dung/ and oversee as they ensure that the surrounding parchwood is safe  in the local area around whitestone as you may or may not know there is a very long history of  dangers within the forest this entire valley was the result of a cataclysmic conflict during the  calamity specifically between the dawnfather pelor and a very dark entity as such there are  still scars of the land that give birth to a multitude of creatures that we need someone to  ensure do not wander far and begin to destroy and threaten our people  laura /none/ what kind of creatures are we talking beholder creatures or big wolftype creatures  taliesin odds and ends its less of a guard and more of a champion  matt yes  laura all right  matt your lesser guard keeps watch through patrols and when something arises you find it  learn about it and if its necessary destroy it  laura yeah thats no problem im really tough and strong and stuff so yeah that sounds fine  liam you can do that  matt your skillset actually fits quite well for this which i understand is why /none/ percival  bequeathed this upon you  taliesin youll be stronger than the last one i will say  laura when was the last one  matt that would be  taliesin that would have been right before the unpleasantness  matt yes about three years before the briarwoods arrival i at the time was much  younger and didnt know much but regae the individual who currently held the position was  not as respected as i think you will easily become  taliesin he was under the anders house which is why the anders house is now forfeit /none/  laura oh  matt im so excited however and while im still learning this as i go through our familys  history and the structure of governance here in whitestone there is how do i a ritual  taliesin that would be  matt a ceremony that you must undertake  laura oh  matt just you  laura just me  matt and taliesin just you  laura what about trinket  matt trinket i imagine as your companion could be a part of it however as the one to be  titled this journey is just for /none/ you  taliesin just for you  laura even keyleth got friends no  sam can we watch  marisha yay vex  laura vex  matt the nature of this is a hunt and i do not believe that your skillsets would aid her in the  speed and tracking that is required for this particular endeavor  liam i think you will be fine  laura obviously i mean im going to kick serious butt but what if i dont what happens  then do i lose my title do i just suck forever what  matt if /none/ you do not succeed then you will have to wait until the dawnfather presents the next  opportunity for the hunt  laura right  matt i dont know  laura when that could  matt  when that would be  laura so wait has the opportunity presented itself now  matt well its as soon as you wish to go and find your way to the sun tree and meditate for the  sign i dont know the specifics of this this is just from what the and she starts pulling over  this cluster of books she /none/ had on the side and she starts rummaging through and she pulls it over  and goes its unfortunately very vague and its apparently keeper yennen might know  more  laura okay  matt hes the resident priest of pelor and this is a ritual of his but yes  laura wonderful well im not intimidated by this at all  marisha youll like the sun tree hes very nice  laura great  marisha yeah  laura great  travis yeah man come on  liam yeah this is great  travis its right up your alley tracking /none/ hunting  laura yeah its fine by myself no big deal no big deal  liam the things you have done  laura this is nothing  liam exactly  laura right  taliesin right  laura youre not going to send me out there to die percy  taliesin hopefully not  ashley is that a possibility  sam you got this  laura thanks tary look at you youre so strong and knowledgeable now  sam dont look at me  laughter  taliesin well go down learn a little bit more and begin when youre ready  /none/ laura all right sure yeah great well i shove a bunch of eggs in my mouth and i get up and im  going to find keeper yennen then  taliesin i follow  matt all right easy enough you find the central the same open almost whats the term  im looking for its the halfdomed speaking presentational  marisha like an amphitheatre  matt amphitheatre thank you yes thats the word i was looking for  marisha words  matt the amphitheatre set up which keeper yennen usually keeps for all his various sermons its  early enough /none/ where nobody has gathered it is not any of the chosen weekly holy days of pelor so as  you arrive he looks like hes in the process of going through and sweeping and doing his morning  ritual of upkeep and you walk up and you can see his beard has grown a bit longer now and his grey  has spread a bit since last time you had a true conversation its been a very tense situation  you can see occasionally the accelerated age that recent events has imparted upon individuals of the  city but as /none/ he sweeps and notices you arrive oh yes  laura hi  matt uh  laura vexahlia  matt vexahlia thank you  laura lady vexahlia grand mistress of the grey hunt apparently which im here to talk to you  about  matt oh excuse me and he wanders off and he puts the broom back in this little closet and  clutter falls out oh god just a puts things back up closes the closet hobbles back in  your direction you are you are the grand mistress of the grey hunt  laura apparently  taliesin she /none/ needs to be appropriately consecrated obviously  laura oh i thought that happened last night dear  taliesin shush now  matt he looks lost anyway its been some time well and he starts looking around and pulling up  small scrolls and reading through he goes and rummages through and finds one yes yes here it  is so for the grand purveyor of the grey hunt mistress in this case is to go into a state of  deep meditation at the base of the sun tree and ask for a vision from the great dawnfather  himself /none/ there will be imparted upon her at the moment of the grey hunt her quarry you are then  to find the quarry wherever it may be within the parchwood  laura okay  matt and decide the fate of said quarry  laura okay  matt thats all i have  laura thats it huh  sam super explicit  laura yeah this explains so much  sam yep yep  laura its very clear  sam find the thing decide to do with the thing what you want to do  matt weve had previous individuals come from /none/ the grey hunt bearing trophies of their hunt  bearing various recovered examples of what they felled  laura so im supposed to bring back some sort of trophy then that would be good  matt a sign of your victory yes  laura right right  taliesin a sign of your victory  laura right  taliesin whatever that victory may be ive read a bit i know a bit about whats to come  laura all right well thank you keeper  matt of course if i may be of aid of any kind let me know though /none/ i dont know how much aid i  can be in this endeavor but let me know  laura thank you  matt good luck and as you walk he says dawnfather smile upon you  laura and you and you the dawnfathers pelor right  taliesin yeah youll do fine  laura great  travis yeah  liam heathen  travis so whatd he say  laura so im going to go and sit in front of a tree im going to think real hard im going to  talk to a god and then im going to go /none/ kill something  taliesin maybe  travis shes so cool  ashley shes the coolest  laura potentially  travis right  marisha yeah  sam super cool  laura looking good tary looking good  liam if you feed it though she becomes unbearable just temper that a little bit  ashley its okay i dont mind feeding it  travis when are you going to do this amazing thinkrealhard  laura well fuck it  ashley now  marisha i buried a secret clubhouse under whitestone at the roots of the sun tree and  sometimes i go /none/ there and i talk to him  laura i remember you doing that  marisha i realise this sounds very uncool when i say it out loud  travis yeah pretty uncool  taliesin youre supposed to build the treehouse in the top of the tree  marisha youre so cool but i totally didnt put the treehouse in the top of the tree i totally  put it underneath the city but theres a treehouse theres a clubhouse  laura i like this technically im supposed to be at the base of the tree right  marisha you can /dung/ go there and be alone and its so quiet and peaceful and dark  laura what if pelor cant see underground what if he needs to see me in the sun  liam what if one of the gods cannot see you underground  laura i dont know how gods work  liam i think he can see you underground  laura i dont know  liam yep nope  marisha although sometimes i do climb into the tree and i hug onto one of the branches  laura solid im just going to walk towards the tree  laughter /none/  taliesin im just going to follow in before we send you off into this  matt all right you walk up and i mean the citys starting to slowly spring to life as the  morning hours climb forward people are arriving and putting the last touches on the caravan the  pale guard is finished and theyve assigned the division between those who are going to stay and  those who are to escort the caravan to emon pike are you with the rest of the party  ashley yeah i need to see whats going on  /none/ matt as youre walking one of the pale guards sees you and walks up and goes lady pike are  you to join us on the caravan  ashley that was today  laughter  matt were leaving its i mean i just dont know  ashley what oh what exactly were we doing im sorry ive had a night  matt you escorted the caravan from emon to whitestone and now were returning to emon from  whitestone with the caravan i just wanted to know if you wished to come or stay were leaving right  now  /none/ ashley oh no  travis no  ashley im no  travis no  matt all right great no thats all right  ashley im saying ive just been waiting for them anyway im going to stay  laura shes going to stay  matt behind this tiny plated gnomish form theres this gargantuan goliath with rage in his  eyes and he goes all right no thats fine were were going to go and he just turns and  leaves and runs towards the caravan  ashley bye be safe  laughter  marisha i need to learn from /none/ pike and grog how to say no  laughter  matt so lady vexahlia youve found yourself at the base of the sun tree  laura yes  matt as you look up at it the morning sun at this point the clouds that gathered yesterday  have all subsided and you have this beautiful clear blue sky ahead of you the morning suns  coming down the tree is beautiful as youre watching it slowly blossom now as the months have  passed you start seeing green in the boughs the occasional pod that might eventually flower as the /none/  season allows it but its serene and as occasionally a breeze blows through you hear the  various branches hit and some of the leaves shake its a beautiful sight what do you want to do  laura did you want to say something percy  taliesin i just wanted to let you know that when i sort of sprung this title on you i chose the  grey hunt specifically the third house is easy its just land and title it doesnt mean  anything as a child the grey hunt was fascinating because it was a title /none/ that one  earned and i felt that you should have something like this that no one could do otherwise other  than claim that you earned it this is not something that can be given and youre going to be  fine i have complete faith  laura i give him a big hug and a kiss i love you dear  taliesin i love you too good luck  laura thank you all right get the fuck away from me ive got to meditate  taliesin backing off  matt as you all separate and scatter off into /none/ your own business for the day in whitestone  vexahlia you find a comfortable place at the base of the tree you sit cross your legs look  up and close your eyes and concentrate  laura i feel itchy but im okay im going to stay still  matt what thoughts are on your mind what do you wish to do what is your approach to this  meditation  laura okay he said im supposed to meditate on the tree or on pelor im going to try thinking  about the tree first a lot im thinking about /none/ the leaves swaying and i think about finding a  quarry and you know hunting things then im going to start thinking about what it feels like  to walk through the woods barefoot and hear the leaves crunching underneath my feet and hear twigs  breaking as i hunt creatures and track them  matt okay as you focus on this and you can hear the breeze you extend what best can be described  as your current consciousness or imagination to the breadth of the parchwood that consumes the  valleys of the alabaster sierras surrounding whitestone you /none/ focus and you remember the  journeys you had in the trees when you first arrived the wandering hunt the phantom  individual wandering the trees in the distance that you didnt quite mark and youre curious  about that moment and you start thinking about the people that have lived here their whole life and  think of the toil and then your eyes open and the sun which was just beginning to come over the  hills into the sky is now far past the horizon youre unsure how much time has passed but youve  had no /none/ vision youve had no words no sign and youre now starting to hit into the afternoon  youve probably been here for a number of hours at this point and youre starting to feel the sweat  drip beneath the armor discomforts settling in a little bit and youre beginning to feel that  conscious difficulty with separating what your mind is trying to do and what your body is telling  you its not enjoying  laura okay i shouldve learned speak with plants from keyleth im going to sink down and im going  to take my armor /none/ off and try to feel the bark beneath my back  matt okay so you turn around armor off just wearing your undertunic and you press your back  against the actual tree itself leaning your head against it and you close your eyes again and  begin to concentrate at this point in the day the sun has crested over so the shadow is still  hitting you from the side of the tree so youre not as warm as you were before you focus and you  concentrate again on the expanse of this landscape the strange difference /dung/ between the warm  midday the cold mornings and evenings and the freezing nights that bring mists and low clouds  that shroud whitestone in this somewhat middletonorthern area of taldorei itself into  the mystic dark mythology that has encapsulated it since it was first founded after a while of  concentrating and letting your mind wander your eyes open again and now youre hitting sunset  its growing colder the breeze has picked up a bit and you see some clouds making their way  slowly from the wind of the southwest cresting over the mountains on the /town/ western side the  alabaster sierras no vision no words you can start seeing now people are walking the street  watching you strangely as they pass you hear horse hooves hitting as they pass by with carts  and people stop and stare and awkwardly whisper to each other and keep walking  laura this sucks is anybody around that i know  matt currently no  laura good i feel really stupid right now fuck im going to try going underneath the tree where  keyleth said  where the little treehouse was  matt okay you find /tavern/ your way to the small tunnel that you guys first carved when you arrived in  whitestone from what was previously an abandoned tavern that has been reclaimed as you enter you  can see now the covered windows have been reopened the place while not a fully functional  tavern yet is in the process of being renovated to start a business again soon so as you enter  the front door you see about five different carpenters or various workers that are in the  process of renovating the interior that all turn can i help you  /town/ laura yeah actually dont mind me i just have a treehouse to get to and i walk through and go  under  matt make a persuasion check  laura i dont know man  liam its all right its all right  middle of the road  laura 15  matt 15 okay the guy looks at you and goes  laura i wink at him keep walking  matt i mean i have no idea what that means but  laura but you like it you like it and i keep going  matt were going to send /none/ joseph just to keep an eye joseph and this one guy turns around and he  looks a little touched he turns around and goes okay ill follow her  laura joseph if you could wait at the door that would be really helpful  matt i can do that  laura thank you  matt yeah ill wait by the door right sure whatever man go for it its fine and they go  back to fixing the inside theyre fixing windowsills joe who seems to be a really sweet guy  probably in his midtolate 30s shaved head /none/ thats just starting to come in a little bit  square jaw but its slingbladestyle hung off to one side a little but he seems like hes a fair  worker and intent on the job that is set before him  laura youre doing good work joseph  matt thank you and he follows you in as you enter the tunnel and begins to walk in the tunnel  with you  laura at the door  matt ah right this isnt a door  laura laughs all right keep walking  matt all right  laura as i /none/ go i want to put my hands on the roots and im going to say hey sun tree i know  i cant hear you but i really need your help right now and i hope you can hear me i dont  know how to do this exactly but i need to talk to pelor and theres a lot of people that are  looking at me like i know what im doing but i have no freaking clue so if you could help guide  me that would be great i sit down and i keep my hands /none/ on the roots  matt as you concentrate and keep your hands on the roots time passes what seems like ten 20  30 60 minutes of silence occasionally broken by a voice down the hallway going you okay  laura yes  matt all right you come back to focusing on the task at hand and at times you catch yourself  you swear you feel the roots get warmer and then you conscious of it and you feel along and no  its probably about the same you may have psyched yourself out youre not sure close your /none/ eyes  again and you focus as the boredom instinctively sets in you have a hard time standing still  youre an individual who likes being bombarded with sensory elements youre a person who needs  to know whats going on around you you always have been that sense of selfpreservation  paranoia whatever you want to call it is being conflicted heavily with the idea of being still  quiet and focused for a protracted period of time youre battling that antsiness you are far  too conscious of your physical body and the discomfort youre feeling i want /none/ you to go ahead  and make a wisdom saving throw  laura god damn it ten  matt ten you can feel the pain begin to rise from sitting for so long your pelvic bone  from being in that position for a long period of time is beginning to grow more and more sore you  begin to shift in place and as you do it doesnt help so you shift again that doesnt help and  every single position you try and shift it seems to throb in pain from being stationary for so long  in /none/ a position that youre not used to its distracting to you eventually a voice comes  through down the hallway that goes all right were done and were leaving you good  laura great joseph you know what  matt what  laura thanks for everything have a good night  matt you too  laura okay  matt you okay in there  laura im great you can go you can go  matt looks scary  laura its not but dont come down here thank you  matt all right well have a good night miss  laura /none/ okay  matt you hear the footsteps grow quieter and quieter and then a kch as the hatch that led to  the basement that you carved the tunnel from closes  laura is trinket here with me  matt trinket is in your necklace  laura pop that fucker out  matt very tight space theres now a big bear and youre like rrr on the side  laura hi sorry about that are you okay are you comfy are you all right is this too big  matt backs up into the tunnel partway and is now borderline /none/ winnie the pooh in the tree trinkets  like fitting in there but snugly but is  travis cat trying to squeeze in the shoebox  laura how much can you stay still  matt grunts  laura im going to cast speak with animals  matt okay  liam winnie the pooh voice oh bother  laura trinket  matt i can i can be still  laura can you come over here  matt oh i guess crawls forward back into the space ducking his head under the various tree  roots like grunts  laura im going /none/ to just lay down dear im just going to lean on you i just need you right now  matt he as uncomfortable in the moment as it is he curls up and forms a crescent soft bear  barrier a bearrier if you will  groaning  matt sorry  travis beautiful  liam you did that  matt you lean back into trinket and the warmth is comforting as it is getting colder here  especially beneath the earth in a space that aside from the natural earth insulation the cold  of the night of whitestone does /none/ get pretty biting  laura yeah  matt the warmth is welcome and you think back and you have really no sense of what time it  is you really dont you have no idea how long youve been in there it could have been minutes  hours its hard to tell  laura its days down here trinket were imprisoned forever this fucking title i thought  i wanted it i thought i did  matt trinket goes really  laura yeah i know  matt i dont want to stay here forever  laura well its not going /none/ to be forever eventually well get sick of it dear  matt okay  laura and then well leave  matt and trinket kind of falls asleep  laura i lean back on him and just look up at the roots and say oh pelor you have something to  tell me and i want to hear it and im getting tired of being down here but i swear im fine im  going to keep concentrating because im committed to you and im committed to this hunt and im  committed to this title and this city and your /none/ tree and your leaves and your trunk and these  roots and the dirt around me and all of that and im going to keep thinking  matt okay as youre thinking about this youre leaning back into trinket the warmth is  comforting make another wisdom saving throw  liam girl  laura all right  liam come on girl  marisha come on get it  laura oh i thought that was a 20 but its not  liam not quite  laura 15  matt 15 okay you lean back on trinket and you watch this darkened /none/ space where theres no light  so youre relying on your elvish darkvision your halfelfs darkvision youre still taking in this  space theres no color but you understand the shapes the shapes of the roots and what seems  like days go by and your mind wanders to percival your mind wanders to your recent venture in the  hells to pikes return to wondering what the hell scanlans up to to what does this even mean  is this worth it what are you going to do stay here the whole point of you and your brother was /none/  to go and wander and not be behooven to anything to be free but then what is freedom at that  point is it taking responsibility your mind cyclically continues to fold in itself all these  questions and these answers and then questions and those answers and before you begin to  realize you begin to fall asleep you swear for a moment you begin to see the roots of the sun tree  begin to grow and curl in your direction and you try and move but you find yourself unable to  paralyzed against the back /none/ of trinket you glance over your shoulder just look over it trinket  isnt trinket trinket is more roots that are curled in around you there is a clasp of various  growing subterranean plant life that is just beginning to impose in your space your vision  begins to dull to blackness  you watch as the roots reach out and grab around the sides of your head and your neck and pull you  and lift you up and you start having flashes memories of the interior of the tree in the  feywild of the way those /none/ roots looked everreaching hungry trying to grasp whatever  life and emotion they can find and that fear begins to seek up into your throat but you  withstand it your understanding of the importance of this and knowing that this cant be real you  shrug off this vision in spite of the roots bringing darkness to your vision everything goes  cold and still and then the darkness opens up once more like your eyes the lids just fold to  reveal a beautiful moonlightdappled pristine glasslike pond in the middle of a deep forest  a very /none/ thickly wooded forest with a very very small series of gaps in the canopy that allow  these beams of white moonlight to hit the surface to refract still calm cold quiet a very faint  mist has gathered across the surface of this water  you just observe timeless you dont feel yourself breathing and you feel like i should  be breathing am i dead i should breathe thats what it means to live but you dont sense that  experience and by the time that thought crosses you to the point where you can feel the panic /none/  beginning to brim up in the back of your mind the water breaks and you watch as a shape emerges from  the surface of the water ripples begin to cascade out from the outside of the shape as it steps  one two three times bipedal in movement this large humanoid shape begins to step forth from the  water you see this almost tenfoottall humanoid mass begin to step out from the water you can  see from the glistening liquid that is just coasting off of its back and body unkept by any  fur or /none/ flesh there is a hide a rhinolike thick gray scaled almost hide that seems to cover the  entirety of its form but what you see is its back this massive muscled shoulder shelf and two  tree trunklike arms that just swing and dangle from the sides as it begins to step further and  further out of this pond and at first you see this creature but you still sense it belonging  and then you sense that theres a reason for this emergence and at that point you watch as the  creature which is now maybe /none/ up to its waist pushing onto kneedepth in the water as it  reaches the edge of the surface you dont see its face you just see over its shoulder and its  massive back no head emerging over top it stops and turns back and as the shoulder turns you can  see the head which is actually protruding forward out of the torso this slumped plated armored head  with a jaw that hinges underneath closed with a series of teeth in the bottom and what you see  for just a glimmer are its yellow eyes glowing /none/ all six of them in rows of two across the top as  it glances back in your direction and it just leaps out of the water and begins darting through  trees and vanishing in the distance and you realize the hunt is on your vision comes back to  you theres no vines and trinket is just sleeping behind you and youre there in the cold  darkness beneath the sun tree what do you do  laura laughs it worked it worked you are awesome sun tree youre the best pelor that is  some fucked up /none/ shit okay trinket wake up we have to go hunt a thing that looks really scary  im going to die how about you  matt um hopefully not  laura good call lets go  matt okay  laura oh fuck  liam get it girl  matt so whatre you doing  laura do i just fucking go straight for it  matt what are you doing what are you doing  laura i dont know i dont know how to go find the lake that he came out of  liam youre the best  marisha youre /none/ a fucking ranger  laura do i remember what it smelled like its really fast it was going through the trees do i  remember a specific look do i remember hearing about a lake in the woods  matt you remember seeing it as it leapt you got a very quick glimpse at its shape and its feet  its giant clawed fingers its humanoidlike hands you dont know of a scent per se go ahead and  roll an investigation check to look back over the memory of what you have and pick out details  laura okay /none/ and i definitely put my armor back on  matt mmhm so youre putting on your armor as youre rushing out of the area  laura what am i rolling  matt investigation  laura im rolling really great tonight  liam you are rolling dogshit tonight  laura which is great 11  matt 11 okay best you can tell given the circumstances the brief vision you had the angle  of the moonbeams are coming from the right and left meaning from your perspective theyre  coming at this angle upon the water and as you step out /none/ into the night you can see the moon is  in a certain place in the sky where your vision if that is in  laura if i turn that way itll be coming at me this way  matt depending on if its in a northern direction or not youre trying to think of where the lake  was there are a couple of ponds that youve seen in the forest youre not fully aware percival  might be the person to ask about this  laura okay okay im going to run to percy do i need to /none/ ooh am i allowed to ask him im going  to run to percy  matt okay percival youve kind of been hoping that everything worked out okay you havent heard  anything from vexahlia since the morning shes been gone for a good 13 hours at this point and  its close to midnight  laura at least i got some sleep  matt a little bit  taliesin im in my study working on things  matt youre in the process of going through books and such and all of a sudden theres a rush of  footsteps /none/ and vexahlia comes bursting into your room  laura i had a vision  taliesin excellent excellent  laura yeah it looks really really scary though so thank you  taliesin im so sorry and excited  laura okay i have a question  taliesin yes  laura i saw a lake a glade do you know of any  matt she describes the pond and its a smallish pond  laura glasslike  taliesin i have a map in my study and i just pull it out and just hand it i must have a map  matt you /tavern/ do yeah  laura percy do you know of anything thats big and tall around ten feet has six eyes going  straight down in a row in pairs really thick hide skin legs like trunks  taliesin grog when im drunk  laura well  taliesin do i know anything  matt this is not your specialty you havent dealt with the grey hunt personally and this is not  ringing a bell  laura is it usually different creatures  taliesin its different every time  laura okay hey do you remember when we were coming here and /none/ we were camping out in the woods  outside and there was a woman i think that walked by with a pack of was it wolves  taliesin yes that was a long time ago  laura did that have anything to do with this  taliesin i dont know  laura great just wondering just thought of it okay i might see you later and i go  matt as you dart out trinket lumbering after you you look at the map and based on the  conversation you had as well there are two different locations that have /none/ ponds roughly the  size that your vision revealed to you both of them have a slight break in the canopy thats a  key that you remember from this and being a tracker specifically you know that most of the  forest the parchwood itself is very dense canopy it rarely has breaks enough to allow that  much moonlight to pass through i need you to go ahead and make an intelligence check  laura okay okay okay roll good roll good all right  liam come on laura bailey  laura stop rolling like shit all right /none/  ashley come on come on come on  liam laura  laura oh god i thought that said a one investigation 24  taliesin yeah  marisha hey  travis get it get it  matt this is an intelligence check so you should add your intelligence modifier  laura fuck  marisha aw hey hey hey  laura an intelligence check would be 19  all hey  matt thats still very good  laura okay  matt you ascertain between the two locations on the map the one that would contain both the right  amount of /none/ canopy that would be open and the size of the pond and the location of the moon would  be far far west of whitestone slightly north beginning to just get near to where the alabaster  sierra mountain range hits the bottom of the valley so you know thats probably your best bet  to get there  laura i hop on trinkets back and we take off  matt you leap on to the back of your bear he goes into a full sprint out of the city the few  folks that are kind of drunkenly wandering /none/ through the city or in the process of making their way  home they all step aside as vexahlia lady vexahlia of the grey hunt  laura im a lady  matt  on top of trinket the bear comes tearing through whitestone to the west barreling towards  the gap in the exterior wall of the city and charging into the depth of the parchwood forest  following the map and keeping tabs on direction about 40 minutes or so of travel you eventually  come upon where you think this pond should be go ahead and roll a /none/ survival with advantage  laura oh yeah because this is my favored terrain  matt yes  laura that was the same thing both times  liam oh double 14s  laura so 22  matt 22 you make your way and you find the pond and you recognize it exactly the moment you get  there this is exactly the pond in your vision  laura this is where it was  matt you glance over and start finding your way around the edge and eventually you find the  thick heavy footfalls right beneath the water he leapt /none/ straight out of the water so there were no  tracks directly out of it but you look just beneath the surface  laura i remember him jumping into the trees  matt yes you look up and you can see a few branches are broken and you begin to trace the  direction of where it went  laura i cast pass without a trace on myself and im going to stealth after him  matt okay all right go ahead and roll a stealth check are you still on trinket for this  laura im going to put /none/ him in the locket for the time being  matt trinket goes into the necklace go ahead and roll stealth with your pass without a trace  bonus  laura oh right 33  matt 33 okay very quietly you dart up into the trees and begin leaping from broken branch to  broken branch eventually it leads you into a small opening between a series the trees here  are truly thick but theres certain areas where they begin to separate a bit and you can see  heavy impacts where it leapt down and found some soft ground /none/ and begins running and you can see  the tracks and you take a moment and study these tracks and you can see exactly how these thick  threetoed feet of the creature dig into the dirt and you take a very very close watch on them i need  you to go ahead and make another wisdom survival check to see where those  footfalls will take you  laura so again a 24 oh wait 22  matt 22 okay so you begin darting through and you notice there are points where it leaps into  the trees /dung/ and vanishes the trail stops but you can follow brief bits but this creatures heavy  you can see it doesnt leap into the boughs and hang on a branch it leaps up onto an actual tree  trunk and then leaps off the trunk and where it does the bark splinters and breaks whatever this  is its extremely dense its extremely heavy and to have the power and strength to lift its  form on that thickness means it has some power behind it continuing to keep tabs youre darting  through the dark woods out of the /none/ right of you you hear a sudden noise and you are surprised as  a series of birds come fluttering past you apparently startled from something nearby and you  watch as a forest elk darts past and is a sign of you know naturally in this environment of  relatively recent movement and you get the sense that you might be gaining on this creature  whatever its charging  laura oh my god oh my god oh my god  matt so as youre leaping and running and making the best possible path you can eventually the  /none/ trail begins to grow a little cold and you find a small glade  laura a small poo  matt yeah i know about 30 feet across the trees open and theres this space and its  pristine untouched the trail ends entirely  laura its just gone  travis what does that mean  liam ceiling  laura can i look up  matt make a perception check  marisha youre making me chew my nails  laura its an open glade you said  matt its a clearing in the forest where the canopy opens a bit and /none/ theres thick brush and  you can see some of the roots of the trees pop up in places but as opposed to previously where the  trees are pretty clustered together and you can find your way through the slight gaps this area  is open by about 30 feet  laura thats okay i get advantage because thats my favored terrain thats cocked i can see  thats a four though  travis its cocked its leaning up against the side  liam go again  laura thats worse  liam one and a two  all oh /none/ no  laura but my perception is 13 so thats 15 for perception  liam thats great because youre badass  laura wow really you dicks why are you betraying me in this moment that i need you the  most  matt okay so as you reach this clearing you glance about and it appears to be empty theres  nothing here theres no sign you can attempt to find tracks if youd like  laura but id have to hop down on the ground  matt youre currently up in the tree yes  laura im still stealthed /none/ though  matt you are  laura im going to climb down the tree  matt okay you find your way stepping onto the somewhat soft floor of the forest  laura oh thats actually really good im going to take a minute i dont know what kind of  creature it is though i dont know if i can use my primeval awareness  matt well you can certainly try  laura im going to try my primeval awareness  matt okay and what are you concentrating on  laura maybe  liam turducken  laura ive got aberrations /none/ its not a celestial probably it didnt seem like an elemental so  ive got fiends those are guys that come from  liam thats where we just were  laura yeah the hells the aberrations  liam possible  laura fey  liam and marisha uncertain noises  laura im going to go aberrations do i have to choose one  matt yeah  laura aberrations are what like a beholder  liam grody things  matt things that generally come from some touch of the far realm  laura im going to focus on that  matt okay /none/ as you sit there and focus what level are you using level one  laura yeah so its within a mile of me oh up to six within my favored terrain  matt true all right you sense no nearby aberrations  laura okay can i take another second and think about fiends no fey  matt okay you concentrate on fey nothing  laura gosh darn it is there nothing in my primeval awareness okay  matt what are you doing vexahlia  laura im going to see if i can find any tracks  matt okay make a /none/ survival check with advantage  laura oh but thats cocked its cocked but its a 20 but its cocked okay thats still  good 24  matt 24 okay and also if you could roll stealth again since you are actively doing something  laura i roll twice do i roll twice  matt no just roll  laura 32  matt 32 okay you step out into the shadow using the edges and you do see the very faint  trail not of feet on the ground but of claw marks carefully placed almost like it  monkeywalked along /none/ the sides of this glade the tracks and claw marks stop in this small cluster  of bushes where inside you can just barely see the faintest hidden glow of six tiny yellow dots  laura is it looking at me  matt its hard to tell the direction  laura yeah im going to take out an arrow  matt okay  laura oh god and im going to fire a bramble shot at the eyes and im sharpshooter  matt you are okay sharpshooter so minus five to hit plus ten to damage go for it  laura /none/ i mean i get no  liam she doesnt have to do that she can just ignore cover  laura threequarter  matt oh i see yeah you can do that  sam sniper starring billy zane  taliesin oh shit the tiny trees have come out  laura oh i could if i didnt put my hunters mark on it but im going to hunters mark him  before i do that  matt okay  sam hunters mark  travis oh breaking out the foliage  matt the general circle here  travis sings its a circle of /none/ trees  matt as i do not have the actual mini for the creature this is working for but this will give  the idea  travis oh my god look at that thing  laura oh hes huge maybe this was a mistake i should have talked to him  travis i should have talked no  laura im trying to bramble shot him  liam youve got this  matt okay well put that there  liam sings matt owns tiny trees  laura and wait before i did that i get my broom ready and then im /none/ going to do what i said  matt okay you get your broom ever so carefully ready you hunters mark him  travis like that guy when hes unloading the shotgun in jurassic park  laura yeah clever girl  laughter  laura oh no is that what this is going to be  matt hunters mark and youre taking your bramble shot go for it  laura i got 29  matt 29 that hits whats the saving throw on that  laura dc 17  matt that is a 20 sorry  laura he is not restrained but /none/ he does take an additional 4d8 of damage  matt yes  laura which is right here ten 15 21 bramble shot damage  liam thorns  laura yes ten 11 12 13 14 was this a surprise attack  matt yes  laura so isnt that an automatic crit as an assassin  matt yeah because youre an assassin it is so with all the dice involved there thats 21 times  two thats 42  matt plus your arrow what did you roll for the arrow  laura plus the what  matt whats the actual arrow damage /none/  laura arrow damage was two lightning damage was two  matt okay so thats eight plus whatever your modifier is  laura one for hunters mark and then i get a sneak attack on him too and then four for that  matt nice that is 56 points of damage  laura plus ten additional for the eight and the two for the bracers  matt right never mind thats 66 points of damage as you pull back and carefully aim the  arrow disappears and you watch as theres a flash of green energy the arrow impacting on /none/ this  creature and the vines curl around you hear a roar and the bushes explode as this entity steps  out tearing the vines off its body throwing them to the ground as they shrivel and shake and then  turn to dust and dissipate into the underbrush as the creature steps out and looks directly at you  its six glowing eyes in a three by three pattern staring right at you the arcing of the energy  finishing throughout its body it stands upright for a moment its hunched form goes almost more  humanoid and it /none/ looks at you with an intelligence that you didnt expect it takes a step and  another step and seems to almost give you a nod of respect roll initiative  cheering laughter  liam laura bailey oneonone dungeons and dragons fight  laura oh no only ten oh wait do i get to roll twice because im in my favored terrain  matt all right you call on this favored terrain thing a lot let me see what it actually helps  laughter  matt there are specifics as to what your favored terrain is aided by do i /tavern/ win dungeons and dragons  cause of my favored terrain  taliesin thats funny because dungeons and dragons is my favored terrain  laughter  laura it all makes sense now  travis i should really be rolling better in taverns though  taliesin tavern as favored terrain is genius  marisha that actually is genius  laura you can have urban settings as your favored terrain  marisha yeah you can have urban settings  matt nope it just means that for your intelligence and wisdom checks related to the  terrain your proficiency bonus is doubled so technically /none/ not even advantage but its worked  out fine so no you do not get advantage for that what did you roll  laura ten for initiative  matt total initiative of ten  laura i know okay matthew  liam that is just under average  matt it is now the creatures turn  laura great thats not a good thing  matt five ten 15 20 25 30 35 it comes rushing up to you swings one of its fists towards  you it comes back as a fist and the claws open right as it comes in /none/ your direction first attack  that is a 24 to hit  laura that hits me  matt all righty you suffer from the first claw strike 17 points of slashing damage as soon as  that claw strike comes by it brings its second claw upward in an uppercut arc that is going to  be a natural 20  travis ooh  ashley come on  matt that is 28 points of slashing damage and then its going to attempt to bite you you watch  now this snub crocodilelike jaw unhinges and opens up with these natural /none/ spiked teeth on the  top and bottom sides its going to reach out towards you that is a 15  laura that doesnt hit me  matt it goes to bite towards you and after the first strikes hit you you duck out of the way and  you hear him snatch together over top making a horrible clenching noise but you are not in the  jaws when they close as you look up as you duck down it pulls back and snorts in a what have  you gottype expression what are you doing  laura okay /none/ im going to pop trinket out  matt okay where  laura behind him  matt you watch this tiny arc of black energy arc over and you swear you see two of the eyes even  though there is no visible iris follow the immediate motion as the rest stay focused on you  and then trinket appears behind it roars  laura im going to disengage  matt okay as your bonus  laura and bamf up into the sky on my broom  matt all righty how high up are you going full movement  laura what /none/ is that 30  matt that is 30 yes  laura yeah but i want to get up to a tree thats far away from him i dont want to hang out on the  broom i just want to be high enough that he cant jump up to me right away you know what i mean  matt yep so you are right up there  laura okay and then i want to brace myself in a tree so if i fell off the broom i wouldnt fall  onto the ground  matt so full movement would be /none/ about 20 feet up and ten feet back  laura yeah sure  matt okay so you would be about there and you would be a little bit lower well say for the  purposes of this because that direction does matter all right so youre back over here got  it right up against this tree thats your bonus action thats your movement what else are you  doing  laura yes he can jump really far i know  liam up go up  laura im going to shoot him  matt okay  laura twice but through /none/ my blazing bowstring  matt okay  laura okay 25 for the first  matt that hits  laura

matt no just once per round  laura and the blazing bowstring is another seven  sam 67 total damage  laura thats not fucking bad  matt no thats not bad at all  liam im sure the thing is on the verge of death  matt so that ends your turn youve used all your actions /none/  laura all im going to do is go you know you seem like a nice guy i hate to kill you  laughter  sam i dont speak english  matt the creature glances over at trinket behind looks up at you in the tree and in a creepily  humanoid way wipes the edge of its jaw and then leaps off this tree  laura trinket gets a swipe at him  matt yes he does and then it leaps in your direction in the sky impact roar arms out jaw  open make the attack for trinket /none/  laura i think he likes me yall what is it a bite attack or a claw attack does it matter  matt whichever one you want  laura a bite attack then that is 12 plus nine 21  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage for trinket  laura wheres my d6  travis that yellow one  laura nine  matt nine points of damage for trinket nice it leaps into the air arms out jaw open towards  you its going to make a bite attack towards you that is a 23 to hit  /none/ laura that hits me motherfucker  matt all righty you suffer 19 points of piercing damage and i need you to make an athletics or  acrobatics check  laura thats great that is a 34  matt 34 the jaw attempts to pull you from the broom the strength of its grasp on you is  extremely heavy you sense that this is a grapple rend technique that it has however you manage to  squeeze out of its teeth and elbow it as you push it off with your foot releasing the grasp you  are not grappled /none/ by the creature however on its way down its going to swing out with its claws as  you push it off thats a natural one two natural ones in a row  cheering  laura and he falls to the ground and he hurts himself  ashley and dies  matt he definitely plummets  sam oh god a tree falls  matt well say for the purposes of this sure as he lands under the tree the tree slams down  and as he hits the ground and slams you can see the dirt has been displaced from /none/ impact this  creature is extremely heavy and dense now seeing it right in front of your face to the point where  its tumbling impact pushed a tree over in the middle of the forest thats the end of its turn  youre up  laura okay  travis two ones in a row  matt two ones in a fucking row  travis no dice jail for that one  matt no this is my goto die this is the fangiven die i use this for everything  laura im going to do something this is all fucking /none/ concentration

need you to roll a concentration check by the way for your hunters  mark because you /none/ took damage for each of those hits youve got to remember that  laura oh a 20  matt so just roll a constitution saving throw  laura 12  matt 12 it would have been thats fine for the first one roll again  laura thats not 12  matt whats that one  laura thats lower thats four  matt four yeah so

arrows whoosh theyre sinking into /dung/ the hide the hide is very thick but  you can see the dark trails of blood just slowly dripping from each of these wounds where the  arrows plug the hole but theyre all sticking and theyre all staying in you just see now this  pincushion of a chest as each arrow stays protruding from the front of this creature its  thick gray hide yellow eyes still glaring at you you can see as it looks around its glancing in  the vicinity for what it can do ending your turn  laura i say so i /none/ mean what are you doing out here i mean do you work for pelor is this  like a thing you do all the time  sam whispers ask her name  laughter  laura whats your sign  matt as youre saying this you watch the creature trinkets hassling it from the back it  pushes off looks over grabs the tree that just fell and picks it up and throws it in your  direction which it makes a strength check to do so that is a 21 to hit  marisha oh no  liam oh son /town/ of a gern  laura it hits  matt okay  travis you went up higher  laura i know im going to die im going to fall and die if i get knocked off this fucking broom  marisha youre like those weather fail videos you got hit by a tree  liam sings my sister in the woods  matt okay you take 17 points of bludgeoning damage as the tree strikes you  sam nightmare on elm street  liam youre okay  travis ooh  matt i need you to go ahead and lets see  /none/ laura i should have had a feast or something before i should have talked to you and had you  inspire me yeah i shouldve thought about those things i was really excited about going and  hunting things  matt yeah well now you know so as the tree impacts you its threatening to knock you off the  broom even though itll remain attached to you its a tumble i need you to go ahead and oh  man thisll be an interesting dc make a strength check to hold yourself on the broom  laura strength check /none/  matt yeah this is to see if from the impact you can still hold on to the broom or be knocked from  it or a strength saving throw is what it would be  liam natural 20 roll now do it right now thats not a 20  laura thats not a 20 thats a ten  matt thats a ten you are thrown from the broom from the impact and immediately tumble  laura to the tree  matt  the tree that fell  laura to another tree because it hit me and it kind of /none/ changed the trajectory  matt okay so you hit a series of branches on the way down  laura trinket sees it happening and he runs over and he saves me and everythings fine and i am  still the grand mistress  matt so as you plummet the broom as youre not on it to gun it it goes limp and you just tumble  as its currently dangling from the chain thats attached to you  laura can i grab it as im falling  matt unfortunately no  liam character development  matt you land prone on /none/ the ground and suffer 15 points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin okay okay  liam you gotta potion fucking down a potion man do it  marisha she can heal herself on a good day  sam she better now  matt it takes a step forward trinket does get an attack of opportunity  laura it gets to attack again even though it threw something  matt no it just moves up to you  laura jesus  matt its now looming over you threatening that was its full action was throwing the tree  laura trinket got a /none/ natural 20  cheering  laura oh my god and you know what i

giant shoulders and muscular chest and the six glowing eyes staring down /none/ at you as it looms  grunts your turn  laura i say why are we doing this why are we even fighting is this a thing is this

concentration up anymore because i got fucking  destroyed  matt correct  liam you have destroyed dragons tree men hearts  laura these are all bonus though really i cant do shit i kind of suck  sam fenthras cant fenthras do something  laura fenthras can do bramble shot which i already did 17  matt 17 just barely hits  all ooh  laura misses or hits  matt hits  /none/ laura okay 11 12 12 plus one lightning damage trinket ran up as i was saying that plus two  sneak attack  matt okay  laura trinkets going to run up and take his swipe while im doing this  matt go for it  laura oh wait no i used

bad 14 15 16 /none/ oh that  doesnt count 16 plus two lightning damage  matt so 18 18 points of damage all right you watch as all these arrows whoosh sink into his  body its abdomen its knee one of the knees kind of buckles a little bit its like grunts you  can see now its visibly hurt its bleeding from a lot of places and as it stands back up its knee  shakes from the impact and as its knee locks into place the arrow that you just shot snaps from the  hide clicking together  laura im /none/ just going to put my arms down and stare at him  matt and you stare at it as it just looms towards you and as it gets stepping up to you now your  standing position its a good four feet taller than you trinket gets another attack of  opportunity as it moves towards you not even focusing on your companion  sam double crit  laura 16  matt 16 just misses trinket swipes and hits the back but just skids off the hide leaving these  scratch marks but no real damage  laura fuck  /none/ matt as it looms forward its going to go ahead and take its multiattack on you it just looks at  you and it goes cracks and you hear its knuckles crack these thick cracks as it brings its fists  into giant angry punches and swings the first claw towards you that is a four plus nine 13 misses  you cocked that is an eight plus nine that is 17  laura doesnt hit  taliesin oh god  matt the bite attack that is 27  laura that definitely hits dodge dodge dodge ugh  sam i /none/ cant watch i cant watch  liam you have uncanny dodge yet  laura i dont have uncanny dodge yet thats level five or seven or something  matt 14 points of piercing damage  sam yells oh  laura im alive im alive im alive  sam wait is that true  liam yeah shes alive  matt i need you to make another athletics or acrobatics check as its jaws are now clamping  onto you attempting to grapple you  laura oh its trying to grapple me 18  sam oh okay okay  matt 18 14 /none/ yeah  cheering  matt fucking this guy cannot roll for shit when it counts okay  laura its okay neither can i  matt there you go so the jaws clamp on you and you just muscle and squeeze out you can feel the  teeth tear against your flesh between the bits of your leather armor as you pull away the armor  snaps open on its hinges and you now have your bloodied shoulder exposed in the moonlight right  now in the canopy as its there youre heaving its kind of heaving staring you down what /none/ are  you going to do its your turn  laura im going to have trinket run up and im going to fuckin a have to disengage and run  the fuck away cause thats all i can do im going to disengage and run as far towards that  tree circle as i can  matt as you move with disengage you can go around  laura okay  matt thats where you can get right there  laura yeah so i want trinket in front of me and then im going to take two more shots at him /none/  matt okay go for it  liam this is it this is it do or die  laura i know im going to die if i dont do this okay that hits that hits thats 28  matt okay go ahead and roll damage  laura okay okay 12 13 14 14 15 16 two for lightning damage and then six for the sneak  attack  matt all right nice nice  how do you want to do this  cheering  matt so the creature is wounded its breathing heavy its standing there and as you rush /none/ past  it turns around and stands tall again looking back at you as you have the arrow in your sights  and you release it the arrow is what do you want to do  laura i dont want it to be fatal  matt oh okay so what are you doing with the arrow then  liam hit em with the feather end  laura just the feather end  laughter  taliesin tickle tickle tickle  ashley boop boop him on the nose  laura i want to get him in the shoulder up here  matt /none/ okay so the arrow whizz as you release it it hits right below where a clavicle would be  and it sinks in deep it goes in probably a good five six deeper than any other arrow that  youve hit it with has done and it sinks and you can see it stops with the feathers at the chest  and it gives out a retches and falls back to its one knee that it was on falls onto its second  knee and its arms lean forward barely keeping itself up like a gorilla  its just heavy /none/ breathing  laura trinket is standing right in front of him eyeing him down and i say youre a noble  creature sent here for a reason yes  matt theres very little response its just standing there looking at you you can see the  eyes are focused on you even through the slight glimmers of yellow even though some of them are  lulling and blinking its muscles are tensing and relaxing as its just taking all of its strength  to stay partially standing at this moment but its listening  laura you can leave you can /dung/ go back to where you came from i protect this forest now this is  mine  matt make just a straight charisma roll just adding your charisma modifier  laura im scared of all of my dice right now oh god  sam use liams  laura i know right straight charisma seven  matt seven  laura i know right its not a saving throw its just a check  matt its just a check yeah  laura im going to throw up  matt it stands up it almost falls again on its knee grasps and puts /none/ its arm over where the last  arrow went in it turns around and leaps back into the forest  laura it can leap no it leaves i take the final arrow before it gets away  matt okay go ahead and fire  laura 18  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  laura im going to throw up sorry this is so late guys 15 16 17 plus two lightning  damage  matt as it leaps in the air you barely see the shadow disappearing into the canopy you take your  final arrow and /none/ let loose  how do you want to do this  laura just right between the shoulder blades  matt it hits you think it hit you dont hear anything quiet and then the heaviest  boulderlike impact of its body onto the forest ground skidding into the mud hitting another  tree that tree falls on top and you have to dodge onto the side to make sure that nothing else  falls in the area and then stillness and calm and quiet hits and the cold finally comes in as the  blood is pumping and the adrenalines /none/ hitting you you felt so warm and youre sweating and at that  point as youre breathing in heavily you can feel the biting cold of the air hitting your lungs and  at that point the adrenaline begins to subside and you notice your breath is showing up and it is  a very cold low mist night now emerging within the forest  laura i walk up and i scratch trinket on the head you did real good there bud  matt bear noises  laura were not dead and i cast cure wounds on myself  matt /none/ all right  laura and then i walk over and try to find a fucking trophy on this guy  matt okay you walk over and you find indeed the creature is laid out it is dead it is cold  the arrow sticking out of the back the final blow seems to have hit a very core nerve center  of its back so carve whatever trophy you wish from its body  laura im just going to cut his hand off im going to cut his hand off no biggie  matt okay so you eventually pull out /none/ a small dagger and hack the hand off it takes you a  little while but you do manage to get it the hand alone probably weighs almost as much as you do  laura jeez this was maybe the wrong sort of trophy to grab okay  matt trinket walks over and takes it up in his jaws  laura wow youre really strong did you know that and i guess im going to you dont have to  carry it just yet cause i want to set fire to the body and burn it im going to use /none/ some of the  branches from the trees he fucking knocked over to set a fire around  matt you do notice that because this area is very thickly wooded setting a fire in the middle  of the parchwood forest probably not a good idea  laura well im going to do it in that opening right there look at that i guess i cant  because  matt you try and tug the creature and even with trinkets help this thing weighs two tons  laura i feel like as a hunter i would know how to set /dung/ a fire to something without setting fucking  fire to the trees im good at campfires  matt make a wisdom survival check no advantage on this one you would have disadvantage so its  negated  sam but this is her favored terrain  laura yo this is survival  matt survival  laura 18  matt 18 it takes you the better part of the evening but you manage to set a very localized flame  around this making sure you have very very damp moss and bits of wet mud caked around to make sure  the /none/ flame doesnt spread eventually the body does begin to burn and by the time you finish and you  feel successful you notice the faint glimmer of morning sun beginning to crest over the mountain  laura i bet everyone thinks were dead hey pelor pelor i dont know if im saying your name  wrong thanks for that and ill be here next time you send something my way  matt so bruised beaten you and trinket find your way back to whitestone you stumble up just  as everyones coming everyones coming to consciousness the worrying has kept /none/ you up and  youve been  taliesin ive known the necklace hasnt gone  matt no eventually as you guys are getting breakfast and discussing if anyone had seen you  you watch as vexahlia stumbles in bloodied bruised filthy and trinket stumbles in beneath  and just chucks this giant gray severed hand of a creature thuds onto the ground  sam and shes great with money and oh look shes back  marisha oh you look awesome i mean you look like shit but you look awesome  laura who has a mimosa  ashley we all /none/ here you look great that thing looks so heavy  matt the staff scatters to make you mimosas  laura its so heavy i couldnt pick it up trinket had to carry it  travis what did that belong to  laura it was this big weird rhinoy thing with six eyes i tried to talk to him but he just  didnt want to listen and i swear he almost fucking killed me i didnt want him to know  liam and you handed his ass to him  laura i mean yeah i set fire to him for /none/ you bud  taliesin would i know anything with six eyes big rhino thing with six eyes  matt sure youve read around  taliesin what am i rolling  matt this would be a general intelligence check  taliesin just a general intelligence check 23  matt 23 as soon as she says that youre like this is a gray render  taliesin you killed a gray render  laura wait i asked you i asked you before i left do you know of anything thats gray with six  eyes and you didnt know and now you know /none/  matt seeing the hand triggered it  taliesin theres a surprising number of things with six eyes and thats  laughter  taliesin thats thats interesting  marisha wait  laura he was really really tough to kill you guys if we had been there together no problem  instadeath  matt what you know of grey renders is they are asexual creatures that reproduce only one  asexually per generation they are territorial and very protective of their young and generally  sometimes bind themselves as a protector of a certain territory and given certain  circumstances can /none/ choose either an individual or a space to protect as well but that can depend on  circumstances otherwise they can be a dangerous force of nature  laura wait does that mean it was a good guy did i kill a good thing  taliesin that means it was natural it didnt have a good or bad aspect to it  laura does that mean its got a baby somewhere in the woods and i just didnt know about it  taliesin maybe maybe not that means that you were sent and that you did what you thought was /none/  right this thing could have been a terrible danger  laura well yeah  travis dont secondguess yourself youre alive you did good  laura no yeah yeah  marisha plus its kind of cool that you killed something called a gray render to become lady of  the grey hunt  laura  of the grey hunt totally hey that makes sense  taliesin yes that is a thing  travis and you did it by yourself  laura yeah imma throw up no im okay no im going to throw up no im good im just going /none/ to  drink my mimosa  liam just keep going  laura okay i need sleep its been a while im going to go lay down i love you guys  ashley i love you  laura im so glad youre here pike  ashley me too  sam good night  marisha you did it  liam im going to take my sister to bed  laura thank you  taliesin im very proud of you  sam weve all learned things from single moms today  laughter  taliesin way to bring it all back  travis oh /none/ my god can i have that  laura i feel really can you  taliesin is there a do they do something with this trophy or is that  matt it is the property of whoever succeeds at the grey hunt it is their trophy to mount to  utilize or discard as they please  travis i just want to go over and fold all the fingers back except the middle one  laughter  marisha can grog lift it okay i guess hes probably the only one  matt yeah you can lift it fine you have a /none/ 26 strength youre like  travis a message from beyond  laughter  matt as youre walking downstairs cassandra whos awake and in her nightwear groggily steps  down the stairs and sees you oh um hows it gone  laura it went great no problems at all totally took care of the problem in the woods and you are  safe and so is all of whitestone  matt so its a success  laura yes great grand success by a mile just totally a success  liam a little woozy but she did her thing  matt even /none/ amongst your messy self she leans in and gives you a soft hug and holds you for a  second and pulls away and shes shorter than you for a halfelf youre average size but she is  pretty short for a human especially for the amount of personality she wields but she looks up  at you and says  laura laughs the amount of personality she wields is what you just did  matt emanating emanating from her huge tracts of land thats not what i meant jeez  laughter  matt you guys i swear to god /none/  liam we are children  travis yup  matt she looks up at you and says congratulations welcome to the chamber  laura oh thank you  matt our mistress of the grey hunt  laura glad to be here  matt she pats your cheek anyway im going to get some breakfast and she looks down and  notices the somewhat congealed blood thats now spattered across parts of her  laura whispers sorry about that  matt im going to go put on another dress anyway welcome  laura

wall next to the door where you leaned fenthras against the stone /none/  you watch as elements of the vines and the curves and the designs of fenthras seem to almost grow  and curl even further the bow seems to have established a more prominent visual presentation  liam whispers youre going to have a very good morning good night  matt so as vox machina completes the final legs of their recent
