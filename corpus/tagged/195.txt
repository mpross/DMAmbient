none	 i think were done and  that means its time  taliesin no  laura no no hey look at this cool dice bag i have its got a bear  matt  to start tonights episode of critical role  laura damn it  opening credits  matt hello and welcome back everybody nice one laura well done so bringing us into tonights  episode last we left off vox machina after completing their assault and destruction of the  chroma conclave theyre tying up loose ends various adventure hooks and dangers theyd left  out in the open 
none	 from earlier or during that whole adventure after taking keyleth to vesrah to take  her final trial of the aramente her long manyyear journey to prove her ability to lead her  people the air ashari you returned to zephra met her father expressed that the trial was  complete and the ceremony took place in which keyleth was given the mantle and officially titled  as the voice of the tempest the nowstanding leader of the air ashari which by the way im  supposed to give you this  marisha what was that the thing  matt 
none	 thats the thing  laura you get another thing  marisha i think this is my leadership thing yeah  matt you have your leadership feat  laura thats your mantle  matt its your mantle  marisha i get another thing  matt its nothing crazy but its fun  laura wait is it a cloak dont you already have a cloak on  taliesin its a mantle it only goes to here  marisha i gave that cloak to kerr  liam rothfuss jacked that cloak  marisha  who wore it away  matt laughs rothfuss jacked 
none	 that cloak  taliesin i like to think theres a piece of paper like pinned to his wall right now  matt he has the stats up there as a reminder framed please do that if you havent already  pat please so after the ceremony is completed  marisha what  taliesin sorry were good carry on  travis perfect timing  liam rehearsal paid off  laughter  taliesin dont feed them  matt after the crowning the ceremony coming to a close the evenings celebration kicks off and as  the setting sun begins to darken the 
none	 sky the people of zephra are now bringing out foods and  treats and cakes and theyre putting up ribbons of blue and white and gold on some of the nearby  trees and doorways and the folks of the air ashari tribe now are in the process of enjoying  both the return of their people and the fact that there is now a clear head of leadership and you  guys are now surrounded basking in the afterglow of the event as well as deciding with slowrising  tension what you have as the next step in your 
none	 journey so what would you guys like to do  travis charge headlong into danger with no lessons having been learned  from the previous sessions  marisha like its day one vox machina lets do this  travis naked and running in full steam  liam like right now  travis yeah no vestiges no nothing  liam that would be the best end to that ceremony peace  marisha its our save game plus  laura but can i go talk to keyleth actually i did want to ask you  marisha yeah  laura are you allowed 
none	 to leave how does this work exactly  marisha i mean im the chief i can do whatever i want right i dont know actually  laura should we talk to your dad  marisha i should maybe talk to dad  laura all right  marisha yeah i go talk to dad  laughter  matt okay and wherever you walk now because you have the mantle upon you and you have the  cascading autumncolored leaf cloak that flows behind you it still seems very ceremonial in this  jovial partybased atmosphere and as you move you still 
none	 cant help but notice that all eyes are  on you at any given point in time people seem generally excited that youve returned and that  youve taken up this position eventually you make your way off where you can see there are a handful  of the older the more elder members of the zephra tribe theyre around korren currently who  notices you approach and shushes them all for a moment turns to you ah keyleth my daughter  how can i help you  marisha korren i was wondering if i could have a word with 
none	 you for a minute  matt of course you do realise that you can still call me father i mean i know youre the  leader but  marisha can i is that allowed i dont really know  matt he puts his hand up and puts his arm around your shoulder and guides you off away from the  chaos of the celebration you hear the whistling of music and flutes and thin tanner drums going  off in the distance and as it fades the further off you guys walk in the direction of the tree  where 
none	 the ceremony took place  something falls in the background  matt oh sorry  marisha you should fire that guy  matt i will  marisha shitty servants  matt its very windy up here dont worry about it  marisha yes thats true  matt as you walk further away towards the tree he takes his arm off from around your shoulder and  says now i understand you have many questions and weve prepared you as much as we could leading  up to this journey youve gone on but now youre here  marisha i guess 
none	  matt primarily the people of zephra look to you for guidance when choices are hard difficult  marisha okay  matt you are the acting head of law like ive been all this time if there is conflict if there  is difficulty if there is a challenge that presents itself that requires the wisdom of a  leader to step in  marisha right  matt thats when youre called upon  marisha so sighs im confused was the aramente my training to be a leader you  apparently prepared me as best as you could before i 
none	 left i dont know how well you all did  sarcastic laugh so im just wondering if i need to expect that again is this just me figuring  this out again or do i have guidance  matt the nature of the aramente is fluid i have not taken it as i am not the leader it is  tradition and it is both as far as i understand a series of challenges and lessons tailored to  whatever a person seems to be seeking or what you can draw from that but also to interface with the  
none	 other tribes and establish that connection between all the leaderships  marisha i did that laughs youre right you havent taken it but thats been about 5 of my  journey all of the lessons that ive learned have been in the inbetween  matt that is part of the aramente itself  marisha i know i guess i dont know just trying to figure out how to navigate this like  the leader im expected to be you know dad you didnt tell me a lot about the world and sometimes  i think i get angry at you 
none	 for that  matt youre not wrong to have these thoughts  marisha why didnt you tell me that the world could be so cruel and mean why did you never tell  me that  matt we tried but you can only tell someone so much do you not think we spent days warning you  of the dangers and difficulty we didnt thrust you out in the world with a smile going have fun  we told you it was challenging we warned you of the people you might interface with that  you couldnt trust and for 
none	 the first legs of it we had a few scouts keeping an eye  marisha what  matt just to make sure you were safe  marisha okay it just sounds like it was advice coming from people who didnt really fully know  matt to be fair when every parent has a child come of age you can only coddle them so far  every bird has to be kicked out of the nest for it to learn to fly not because we want to but  because thats how things are  marisha i know and i thank 
none	 you for that i guess im just wondering whats next now what  matt now as leader of these people you go and learn how best we can establish ourselves in this  countryside where once we sighs gwessar or taldorei as the humans call it all of our  civilizations are merging isolation that weve relied upon is becoming less and less viable  marisha i agree  matt and so part of i think what you have already begun is finding a way to bring not just  the ashari but zephra as well necessary friendships and allies 
none	  marisha our people need to be connected to the rest of the world that weve sworn to protect i  understand the need for our isolation but i often wonder if we had a few close allies on alert if  the thordak incident mightve have gone a little bit differently  matt i agree  marisha i still need time with vox machina we still have things we need to complete and then i  promise i will return  matt all right come back do what you need to youre not bound to this mountain just know 
none	 that  your heart is here and well call for you if we need you and when youre not needed beyond it  this is your home  marisha thanks dad  matt im proud of you and his professional exterior falls away and he just steps forward and  gives you a big warm fatherly embrace and just holds you there  marisha okay dad thank okay  matt sorry he rights his posture shoulders back  marisha i do the same adjust my mantle a bit another question do i have to wear this like all  the 
none	 time its a little unwieldy it feels a little froufrouy kind of ceremonial its just a  little feel like im going to trip on it  matt you know do what you like its yours  marisha okay cause going upstairs in it like in the heels its a little unwieldy i mean its  beautiful im going to go get a drink  matt you probably should  marisha okay yeah  matt all right  liam you read lips whatre they talking about  laura ah they were talking all about you actually  liam i dont 
none	 believe you  laura yeah yeah yeah  liam why would they be talking about me  laura its this whole conversation about you  liam you are full of shit  laura no i heard she was saying how much she admired you and he was saying er i dont think  i feel it as much and she was like no really dad you just need a chance to really talk to him  and he was like no just believe me i did talk to him and i dont feel that way  liam yeah yeah im 
none	  laura and then she was like never mind  laughter  liam im so glad i confide in you i have you to lean on you are the rock in my life what would i  do without you  laura they actually said that as well they were talking about how amazing i am  laughter  liam while shes talking i start to walk away quietly as possible  travis im so happy right now  marisha laughs so good  travis ah deception  matt so as the ceremony dies down the evening comes to rest 
none	 the night sky takes over and you  can still hear the gentle whistling of the winds through the various cracks and crevices in the  mountainside you are brought to your respective temporary abodes for the evening to rest and to  plan and plot what you wish to do going forward so what do you want to do  liam well figuratively or literally go to hell i imagine  laura yeah are we doing this tomorrow morning were heading out to hell  liam yeah i mean whatre we going to  travis first things first  
none	 laura first things first what grog  travis right  liam squad leader  laughter  travis how do we get there  laura oh shes got plane shift right  marisha i can get us there  taliesin very easily actually thats the easy part  travis we dont take like a ship  taliesin no sadly we cant  laura no ships  liam no but we dont know exactly where were going to land right  marisha correct  laura well we know the city that we want to go to  marisha i can get us 
none	 somewhere within the city of dis i dont know if  laura dis city  marisha built dis city  liam man this is going to go great  marisha it was too easy  liam i mean when we went to the city of brass we did not shift into the city of brass we dumped  quite a ways away  marisha it was yeah but on the outskirts  liam yeah so we have no control over that so  laura we could pop into it we could pop out of it  liam yeah so whatever 
none	 plan we come up with one branch of the future is complete bullshit  improvisation for if we fall into the shit  travis right  liam so theres no planning for that so if we dont fall into the shit and we land somewhere  relatively safe whatre we going to do howre we going to play this this is hell  taliesin well it is complicated and as hells go there could be worse hells  ive been reading  liam shocking  taliesin thank you ive been looking into this and it seems that where were going 
none	 has a very  very structured hierarchy its very ordered the society makes sense and wherever we find this  creature that we have to slay there will probably already be forces working against him that will be  happy to ally with us to help that happen theyre vicious psychopathic creatures that only function  because they maintain these rules with each other about how theyre supposed to act  laura its very ordered  taliesin i think it would be possible to find people who would be delighted for outsiders to  come in and do their dirty 
none	 work for them  laura however scalebearer big high guy really important guy said not to make a scene he said if  we make a scene that would go poorly  taliesin yes  travis says him psh  liam theres no point for sextuplets we cant do that thats not going to work  taliesin no they can see through things its going to be complicated as well because we have  value as well  travis oh i got it we kidnap the president of hell and we assume his visage  liam whats a president  
none	 taliesin his name is asmodeus and no we are not kidnapping asmodeus of hell  travis why  laura i think hes probably kind of powerful  liam hes really heavy  laura might be hard to lift him up  travis have you seen him  taliesin ive seen sketches  laura you have  taliesin yes well i mean i dont know how correct these are  laura morning morning has come  marisha oh wow  taliesin oh my  marisha these are a power surge in there  liam we talked all night and we squared 
none	 it away and were going to hell  matt you talked all through the night no rest was had  laughter  marisha its very bright  taliesin were going to be offered things there theres going to be deals made  liam so were talking negotiation or bullshitting our way one or the other  taliesin its going to be negotiating probably with someone wholl give us cover if we do some  dirty work  laura i mean is it similar to the city of brass it sounds so similar  taliesin they have a lot in common 
none	 yes its even more structured though theres quite a  complex i alone have identified 13 different caste systems within their function  liam caste systems  taliesin theres imps spine devils barbed devils chain devils bone devils theres all  these different kinds of devil and each devil has to answer to a different devil they answer  specifically to the devils that have fealty over them who in turn are at constant war with the  devils who are in fealty to other devils and archdevils and greater devils who in turn all  owe their fealty to 
none	 asmodeus  laura but we are not devils  taliesin we are not devils  laura therefore weak and liable to be taken as slaves  taliesin we are not even slaves we are consumables  marisha i dont know i feel like weve gotten a bit of a reputation for ourselves im sure that  word has spread were not you know  matt you would know this  taliesin yes  matt percy through your research its not terribly uncommon for mortals to wander through  the city of dis specifically because it is where goods gold and 
none	 largely souls are traded to and  from various structures or entities within the hells and beyond to just consume or eat someone  means nothing the true worth of a soul is in corrupting it and they do so through enticing  through corrupting their morals through driving mortals through bargains and pacts to end up  twisting into entities of order and evil as well and then claim the soul of that contracts are a  big thing  taliesin and then turning that into a lemure yes  matt yeah into a lemure or other forms of 
none	 soulbased energy but contracts are a very very  important part of the whole economy  laura so the person that we made a contract with was a devil that ended up being the one that  killed pike right that was a devil disguised as a demon  matt ah no that was a demon disguised as a devil  marisha yeah that was super confusing  laura okay  matt confusing  marisha that was the one that we wished our way out of the contract  matt correct yes  marisha yeah we dont really have that 
none	 anymore  taliesin i was very proud of that  laura yeah we dont have a wish okay so we make no deals when we go  marisha no deals no contracts  laura no deals no contracts no shaking of hands no signing of anything  taliesin no accepting of gifts  travis feel like im going to forget this  taliesin you are  marisha just dont touch anything  laura oh no dont touch anything  taliesin might have to make you special gloves that dont have any fingers  travis ive got special gloves  taliesin 
none	 even specialer gloves  marisha like a muff  laura that we can wear over those gloves  travis like a what  marisha like a hand muff  laughter  travis youre going to make me a special hand muff  laughter  matt taryon does pipe in hes like  marisha we could put little ears on we can make it like a kitten  matt oh but ive such fine handwriting if we need to sign anything just let me know im happy to  laura no tary no signing anything  marisha nope  matt ive 
none	 signed a lot of contracts in my time my father used  laura no signing of contracts  matt  to do contracts throughout the countryside  laura although im sure youre good at reading contracts as well  matt this is true  laura yes you can read them but dont sign them how about that  matt how about if i read them and i like it  laura no no signing  laughter  laura unless you want to stay in hell  matt agree to disagree  laura and we come back here  taliesin your 
tavern	 current contract with us actually stipulates that you cant have another contract  enacted until you confer with all of us  marisha exclusivity  taliesin yes  matt he goes through his bag and pulls out the contract i stand corrected  taliesin im very thorough  laura i dont even remember he signed a contract  matt doty write this down be more careful about exclusivity in future contracts  laughter  taliesin i dont think you were there this might have been just him and me getting  drunk at one point  travis is there any 
none	 worth to only a few people or one or two going in to get a lay of the land  once we get there instead of just moving in our truffleshuffle normal formation  laura i feel like that could be very dangerous for one person to go in alone  liam yes i agree  travis ill do it  laura grog no  liam no  travis im very stealthy  laura last time you were aloneish you almost killed two guards  travis what is the problem with that  laura in vasselheim  travis we got 
none	 away with it right did we get caught did we get caught tary  matt no we did did we get caught  travis no  matt i dont know i still have i only remember half of what happened  travis tary is very excited about my plan its affecting his memory of what happened  laura right  matt i think i blocked it out but what i remember was interesting  laura you could always look in dotys diary and find out exactly what happened  travis yeah peruse the last 90 pages for the last hour 
none	  matt takes the book and starts thumbing through real fast you look over at doty who still has  chunks and clusters of bits of red hair from the somewhat removed goatee  laura fu manchu  matt yeah his secret goatee  marisha so percy we know a lot of things and people move through the nine hells what does it  say about rakshasas in there where do they fall in the caste  taliesin it doesnt actually say where rakshasas would fall in the caste does it  matt there wasnt a terrible lot of information 
none	 not all the devils are in the same system there  is a promotiondemotion system in which devils advance and are demoted based on their elements  there but there are other fiends that exist in that space that arent part of that system  rakshasas are a little bit outside of that system succubi incubi theyre a little bit outside of  that system there are other fiendish creatures that actually traverse between both the abyss and  the hells based on what their interests are so thats predominantly the structure of the devils  that are  taliesin 
none	 in dis  matt well that are built within the hells as their primary domain  liam percy help me understand since youve read so much about this  taliesin yes whole page  laughter  liam good on you so if the raven queen escorts souls if youre an absolute terrible shit of a  person and the raven queen escorts you over to the other side were going to be wandering amongst the  souls of the damned people who die go to where were going  taliesin if theyre under contract this is where they go  
none	 matt and many who sometimes arent under contract go there as well  laura oh really  matt and you would know this actually the raven queen as part of the laws of the cosmos that hold  the various planes together the raven queen does indeed escort good souls to the positive planes  the upper planes and notsogood souls to the lower ones  laura actually i know that from reading a lot about the raven queen i can answer that for you  travis if you dont use a turn signal if you have a vanity plate 
none	 you go to hell  laughter  liam thank you i know they get escorted to the other side it just seems like an odd idea to be  walking in a city full of the thrownaway im talking to the air right now  taliesin no were absolutely listening  laura im sorry keep going  liam it was the best thing you never heard  laughter  taliesin that changed the game forever  liam i miss scanlan shorthalt so badly  marisha because he listened to you so much more  liam no hes just my buddy 
none	  all aww  taliesin speaking of just our buddy  marisha as we move on  taliesin  pike is another concern i would feel far more comfortable making sure that she is  definitely on board for this  travis really  laura well thats difficult  liam phone a friend what do we do  taliesin i dont know ive been thinking about that the best way to  liam i mean hotis how long has it been dm  matt since  liam since pike wasted his sorry ass  matt its been offhand a couple 
none	 of months  liam a couple months i mean i dont think one more day is going to kill us if we want to go get  her you know  laughter  laura thats difficult  laughter  taliesin i know i do bring it up though that it is one those things that we should talk about  liam i mean if the fates allow  marisha yes i feel like we would have to find someone to send message  laura yeah  marisha there is a message spell maybe in the form of a text  
none	 matt just blackmail the writers of blindspot  laura yeah  marisha yeah laughs  laura ashley is in new york laughs  taliesin this is one of those things where i thought i would just bring it up now before we go  running in there  liam oh i was just trying to guilt matt into playing pike but  taliesin i am okay with that too  laura no its ashleys character though  marisha i mean we kind of did  travis pike tary what else laughs  matt yeah just throw all the npcs at 
none	 me  laughing  liam its not the thordak battle theres not 87 miniatures on the board  laura no but i mean it could be we dont know  liam all right well were all going to die  marisha wed also have to see if ashley would be down with us you know  taliesin i thought i would bring it up  marisha  kaijuing pike once again  taliesin i just thought i would bring it up  matt you guys could jaeger her again  taliesin  cause it is one of those things that 
none	 is pretty clutch down there  liam not prepared but we never are  travis nope so we kidnap the president  laughter  laura definitely im liking it more  marisha so im curious if rakshasas arent necessarily part of the system and this guy tends  to come in and out and just make peoples lives a living hell laughs hell were going puns  travis good slick  marisha then maybe no one would miss him in fact maybe people down there dont like him  you know  taliesin the feeling i get reading the more 
none	 i read about this place is no one likes anybody down  there and so if we can figure out a way to be convenient about it you can disappear anybody  liam also didnt someone tell us that if they get trashed they are treated like shit there  taliesin hes probably not wellrespected  liam weve trashed his ass twice  travis when we went to the city of brass we were owned right thats what let us move  around so freely  taliesin we dont have to do that here  laura are you sure okay 
none	  liam sighs i mean we thought it was getting us around but it clearly wasnt  travis theres nothing that we need to think about like that so that we have  laura so we should just go down act like were evils like our souls have been claimed by another  devil already  taliesin honestly the more we act like us the more people are going to try to  tempt us into things  marisha i could use alter self or try and change into something thats devily  laura cant they see through that  
none	 taliesin theyll probably see through it  marisha i have a question  matt yes  marisha because that is an interesting question because  matt illusions are different than actually physically changing yourself  marisha right its transmutation  matt correct  marisha because shapechange is considered a transmutation spell whereas seeming was an  illusion spell  matt seeming was an illusion illusions and  travis you actually become that thing  matt as far as you know the pit fiend you encountered is the only creature that saw through  an illusion  laura okay  matt 
none	 however illusions and transmutation spells things that actually physically alter your form  thats not considered an illusion you are actually changing your physicality so alter self  would not be something that a creature with truesight could see through  marisha can i alter self to a succubus  matt i mean you could alter yourself to look more  marisha to look like one  matt  like one maybe yeah  marisha or like a tiefling  matt i mean you wouldnt be able to give yourself wings  marisha are tieflings a thing in the city 
none	 of dis  matt you dont know  marisha percy are tieflings a thing in the city of dis  taliesin i dont know  matt ah actually  laughter  taliesin would i know its not on the page you gave me one page  liam if you just think for a second  matt i know i know well before i gave you a basic structure and i am filling  in the gaps as we go  taliesin sure thank you  matt yes they are quite often found there that is specifically a city that a 
none	 lot of the social  construct revolves around the crosssection between the mortal races and devils  marisha i wonder if they have guides i wonder if i can be like a tiefling tour guide for you guys  laura maybe you could be our conduit the person that brings us to  marisha yeah like an ambassador an escort  taliesin already have us under contract  marisha already have you under contract  laura sure  travis yeah  taliesin do you feel up to this level of deception i say with all seriousness  marisha inhales you 
none	 know its not my strongest suit and i recognize this  laura wait wait tary do you have anything like a spell you can make any kind of trinket  laughs that would help keyleth be better at lying  matt oh well i do believe that i can enhance somebodys visage  laura well not that no im talking an actual like ability to tell lies better something that  would up her maybe charisma  marisha does he have enhance ability is that what you are talking about  matt yeah  marisha he can give me enhance 
none	 ability which means i would get advantage on checks  laura thats better  marisha which i can do on myself as well yeah so yeah i can give myself you know i can  matt but i can do it as well and probably a little better  marisha and tary can do it as well ill talk into a mirror for a little bit practice some  things that tieflings might say what are things tieflings say  taliesin oh god im a tiefling what happened why has this happened to me  marisha oh god im a 
none	 tiefling what happened why is this happening to me see  laura thats perfect thats perfect  taliesin its uncanny  travis i dont believe you  liam we are so close to being able to semiretire and take it easy we cannot cock this up were  going to hell weve no plan what if we went and were completely honest and were ourselves and  explained that we were here to remove the shittiest devil in the city  laura seriously seriously  liam i am being serious  travis yeah he does have a slight point  
none	 liam we tried that weve tried that i mean maybe itll work we just run willynilly thats  what we do  travis maybe we do them a favor its not like were saying  taliesin im of the opinion that a bunch of mortals show up in the city of dis looking for a  rakshasa i think theyre going to be able to put two and two together  marisha why yeah theyre going to know i honestly dont think anyones going to have a  problem with us killing this guy its just a matter of do 
none	 we want to be full vox machina  because it might paint a giant target on us or maybe have someone as a silent escort i could try  and not speak a whole lot  liam yeah i mean you could  marisha i could just maybe i could be a mute escort i had my tongue cut out  liam i mean i just feel like our certainly without scanman our chances of fooling anybody  are lower than theyve ever been so maybe having you as a tiefling escort gives a little  credibility to the dummies 
none	 there  laura yeah  liam theres lots of people whore not dummies  though and i feel like we should just quietly  negotiate our way through because i dont think we can bullshit not without scanlan  taliesin i think thats very fair  marisha yeah  laura all right  marisha i agree okay  travis i got lost but i agree  laura did you ever get a response from sam on his potions so i didnt want to tell  liam six regular three medium one superstar if you need gold ive got loads

none	 here for that  laura okay ill take a greater as well  marisha all right  travis are you sure you dont want to give me one because i usually end up pouring it into one  of you sloppy saps  laura good call greater for grog  liam thats a good idea  laura so thats all three greaters taken  taliesin ill take two regular if youve got them  laura two regulars for percy two regulars for keyleth  marisha sure  laura and thats well thats two regulars left  liam thats like strapping 
none	 a turkey baster to a tank thats what that is  travis yeah yeah  marisha i would maybe just keep those or give them to grog maybe once again  travis get up laughs  laura okay so grog  travis what  laura you have two regulars and one greater  travis yarr  laura all right  liam fred freddie do we know what languages are likely to be spoken there  travis oh good question  liam does that say in your books  marisha did you just call percy freddie i like it  laura 
none	 he keeps calling him that  matt infernal  liam its his name isnt it  travis frederick  taliesin infernal they speak infernal technically it would be a middle name  liam do you speak infernal well it is  taliesin i do not speak infernal  liam  your name is it not you have 37 of them am i allowed to use any of ones between the  first and the last  taliesin i am struggling to find a reason why not which is somewhat irritating  liam you know were years into being friends what 
none	 do you prefer  taliesin percy is just perfectly reasonable  travis what about droll  laura what about von  marisha drolls pretty good  liam droll  laura what about musel  liam oh jeez i was just about to agree on it but  taliesin my god youve found the line and ive drawn it  liam i dont know drolls pretty good man drolls great  taliesin droll is actually pretty slick  liam im suddenly extremely jealous of grog for coming up with that name oh man yeah thats  going to haunt you my 
none	 friend  taliesin youre just going to end up wings someday thats all im saying  liam yall wanna stop and get a wing  laura infernal but they speak common im assuming as well  matt you dont know you really dont know  laura ah shit we dont know anybody who speaks infernal do we  marisha hey tary  liam what about zahra  marisha do you have any spells that help you be able to speak languages isnt there a spell  called languages  matt not at the moment however if we have enough time 
none	 im sure we could go and find a local  class that teaches maybe go to the lyceum and we could learn the basics few weeks  travis tary do you want me to punch you in the face  matt no i do not please dont do that which by the way if we need any sort of healing and  he rummages through his pouch here and says i can muster a couple of shortterm potions if it  gets too bad  laura why did you take one of the greaters if you can make healing potions 
none	 on your own  matt well i can only really use one for myself and i wanted a backup  laura right  taliesin so infernal is going to be a problem  liam and were taking doty with us is that the plan  matt i dont see why we wouldnt why would we not want to bring him with us  liam im sure theres lots of robits in hell  taliesin does doty speak infernal  matt doty doesnt speak  taliesin can he write in infernal  liam is he a protocol droid  matt this 
none	 is where it would be useful for sam to send me his character sheet so i would know what  languages he chose but because sams not here no doty does not know or speak infernal  liam somewhere an aerators going raspberry  travis sams stuff is right there isnt it  laura oh yeah  taliesin no thats my stuff im spreading because hes not here  laura understandable  marisha not really  laura manspreading  travis can we tear off your sleeve and then you understand infernal  matt no you dont need to do that 
none	  travis we could try  matt i would not recommend it  taliesin i speak disco but not infernal  laura no  taliesin so sorry  marisha sings disco inferno  taliesin im not really that sorry  travis you cant just offthecuff that youve gotta save that for something  taliesin that was for the aladdin earlier i had to do something in retaliation were looking to  see if anything  laura i speak abyssal but thats the other ones  liam thats the other guys  marisha i mean if i wanted to use shapechange 
none	 to actually turn myself into  laura a succubus  marisha  a succubus or a rakshasa then i would speak infernal because i do get that with we  didnt really fully decide it never specifies  matt i would say yeah  marisha because you get everything but you just keep your intellect wisdom and  travis yeah do that  liam you get a whole other language  laura tight then make yourself a succubus  matt well no you keep your intellect its not like you learn what the creature would know so  probably not 
none	  marisha but you learn their spells and abilities you automatically get those  liam are the spells in the brain though or in the body  marisha it doesnt specify in the spell its kind of what you decide  taliesin it depends on what kind of spell like elemental spells  laura i really want to see what you look like as a succubus personally  taliesin i do too this picture they have in the book is quite exciting  marisha yeah shes got a whip  taliesin yes she does  matt any average example of 
none	 that creature one without any class levels or the spellcasting  trait so you dont get any spells if you turn into something that has spellcasting you dont  get their spells you maintain your intellect  marisha but i get their abilities  matt you get their abilities their physical abilities and things they can do  laura oh but thats different than knowing their language  matt yeah so i dont think youd pick up a language  travis yeah you get to suck  marisha all right  matt sorry  taliesin well we may have to 
none	 actually hire a guide once were in there then  laura no we cant hire anyone why cant we just a hire a tiefling dont you have any other  tieflings in your tribe  marisha maybe but i imagine they would be superrare  liam youve been gone a while  marisha do we have any  liam maybe ask dear old dad  matt well say for the purposes of thank you for the text so he checked on the languages that  doty knew  laura aw thats great  matt and infernal was not one of 
none	 them im sorry so there are two tieflings that exist in this  society theyre pretty rare when it comes to ashari just because a lot of tieflings tend to  not feel comfortable in some natural elements sometimes  marisha sure  matt one of them is about six years old and the other predominantly works as  a gardener in the vicinity  marisha so its not a guarantee that they know infernal necessarily  matt its not a guarantee i dont think  taliesin we could go ask  laura i think we go  marisha i 
none	 could go ask i mean i could go and get a few buzzwords you know  liam lets find that sixyearold  marisha  hello goodbye please thank you left right  taliesin no thank you  matt actually most tieflings do learn infernal as a language  marisha what time is it  matt you guys have been talking late into the evening its maybe one or two in the morning  laura so go in the morning find out if not well just go there and hope that  someone speaks common  taliesin it is called common 
none	 for a reason  marisha yeah common i feel like well be okay  liam well we cant sit here and wait for him to come back weve just gotta fucking do it right  laura yeah  marisha unless i could try and talk to dad too and see if he has anything that might help with  languages but i dont know i think well be okay well be all right right  laura its just hell  marisha its just hell its fine  laura no big deal fine  marisha okay so do we have a 
none	 vague plan should we sleep  taliesin sleep talk to the gardener  liam but if we do this were done we can take it easy  laura ish  taliesin for a bit  liam to do what what is left the dragons are dead all thats left is hotis what is left  laura the fucking deal that i made with your fucking goddess who knows if shell call us out  on it but  liam yeah  laura theres that  liam well im not going to run right back to the temple are you

none	 part of the ritual is also  marisha oh my god tell us something  taliesin you are going to have to go into the woods and meet something  liam hes making this up as he goes  taliesin no im really not  laura meet something  taliesin you go into the woods there are creatures that live in the woods that have been  affected by the land that have gained some  travis youre going to shroom your tits off  laura do i get really high is this the whole point of the grey hunt

none	 that is asked for  laura oh wow  taliesin but part of that then gives you a practically divine right to manage and look after  the creatures of the woods and our hunting and what is reasonable to be killed and otherwise i  think im covering most of it  marisha how do you mean divine like she can see things if she kills the radioactive beast does  that mean she gets radioactive powers  taliesin divine more in the sense of what reasonable people do to tell commoners that were  allowed to talk to 
none	 them  marisha oh thats not as fun  taliesin less exciting  laura do i go alone or do i get help  taliesin you do go alone no you do not get help  laura oh shit  marisha thats so cool  liam youre so fucking transparent sometimes  laura sounds fun  taliesin i think youre going to do very well  marisha oh youll be fine  laura i look forward to it  marisha shes killed tree beasts and dragons shes fine  liam everything under the sun  travis tree beasts or three

none	 marisha can you help me build some sort of maybe like alarm system  taliesin that sounds very expensive im not sure that thats possible yes of course i can help  you with something like that  marisha okay but with taxpayers money also something else you taught me  taliesin it will be a string on a bell youre learning so well  marisha yeah just two cups on a string  laura can we go to bed  marisha yeah lets do that  laughter  taliesin are we all sleeping in this hut or do we

dung	 are  matt right its easy enough to find in this city in particular a tiefling sticks out like a  sore thumb you see a woman probably in her its hard to tell with a tiefling demon dont  crack but shes a little older shes in her 40s probably dark purple skin the horns curl  backward and come to almost a singular point behind  laura oh cool  matt and the dark hair shifts in streaks of gray but shes in the middle of what looks to be  gloves on in the process of checking

none	 space between  laura oh god  matt before you a glow begins as you rocket towards an unexpected and incredible sight an  endless permeable tapestry a tangled lattice of burning divine fire appears before you writhing  and growing as you shoot towards it with incredible speed you instinctively wince and  curl a promise of impact triggering your need to defend yourself the dread as the air begins to  heat around you then whoom you impact and pass through harmlessly the heat fading you  glance over your shoulder to see it gone you just passed 
dung	 through the divine gate  travis the divine gate  matt you glance over your shoulder to see it vanish but then another flash of red magical  power consumes your vision as your feet suddenly find hard ground as the rush of powerful energies  subside the swirl of color and sudden thrust of movement coming to an abrupt halt you find  yourself standing within an extremely dark alleyway of some kind framed by the exterior of  dark stone buildings climbing up above you for many many stories the cracked thick  cobblestones that mark the floor 
none	 are littered with filth slivers of cracked skulls and bones as  well as discarded refuse of some indeterminate origin the air here is extremely hot the walls  and floors themselves around you seemingly the source as you look you glance out past both sides  of this alleyway youve somehow arrived in and the air distorts with intense heat as smoke rises from  the streets themselves around you the occasional ash or ember drifting through the air in front  now the dense city that surrounds you is incredibly massive the walls the structures that  clutter 
none	 the immense black metropolis surrounding you glow at the edges like heated glass as you  peek past and look further out you can see the city is a broken maze of metal ramparts built into  miles of steep hillsides and shattered towers framing an endless labyrinth of twisting  alleyways within these streets your eyes dart around to see dozens of molten slithering masses  of flesh shifting past the mouth of the alleyway roiling stepping with sick slapping sound their  faces twisted into a grotesque look of everretching horror the sound escaping like a  gasps 
none	 in pain wince with an underlying screech and scream you see behind them cracking lashes  over these masses of flesh two large humanoid devils with spinelike protrusions that come  jutting out of the sides of ashwhite skin pulled tight against a massive skeletal form the backs  of their bodies forming these gargantuan scorpionlike tails that dangle looming  dangerously in front of them as they step forward whip sounds two more lashes go you see these  fleshy masses gasps begin to clutter up again and move further past the exit to the alley as  these 
none	 bone devillike creatures slowly crawl past one of them stops for a second and continues  walking as you all hold your breath a sudden horrid stench of decay fills the air as they pass  you hear them crackling in the distance as they shove along their tortured charges as you glance  up past them you see the sky now dozens of winged shadows glide through the air across a  greenish cloudy barely lit sky that flashes with far distant cracks of lightning occasionally  brightening darker shapes larger looming in the distance but one that draws 
dung	 your eye like a  terrible dream unable to look away upon noticing it is an impossibly colossal tower of black iron  and lead stretching for hundreds of miles into the sky before vanishing into the dark clouded  expanse above you you blink and turn around to look at the other side of the horizon but there  stands the exact same tower you shift around no matter your view of that horrid horizon there  stands the iron tower the throne of the archdevil dispater standing evervigilant over  his iron city of dis and thats where 
none	 were going to take a break  marisha good i have to pee so bad  laura wait i have a question we did a heroes feast last night right  matt nope  marisha nope we didnt  laura i thought we said we were going to do it i thought we were going to do it  matt you gotta say youre going to do it nobody said it  laura didnt we say we were going to do it  liam might have said it last game but i dont remember it this game  travis we

none	  liam ill do the same  laura 30  liam thats better than me 24  matt okay as you come up to the edge and lean against the wall looking over the side first a  moment passes and as your shoulder hits the wall you smell something burning as you glance back  suddenly your shoulder you can see the heat of the actual wall with just a brief contact to your  body has begun to burn  travis what  matt  and singe the outside of your cloak  laura oh crap  liam 
none	 pat your hair pat your hair pat your hair pat your hair  laura ow ow ow ow  marisha wait from just peeking around the corner  matt from just leaning and touching the wall  travis groans ugh its tucson  matt you immediately notice that the bottom elements of your shoes are melting a little bit on  the bottom with your steps  laura oh my gosh good thing rubber doesnt exist here  matt the city itself is just this emanating source of perpetual heat youre already sweating  in the presence here and as 
town	 you glance around the corner and look at these buildings that rise up  you can see the architecture is hooked to the corner as the monolithic deep reds and blacks and  grays that everythings built from nothing belies an exterior that would seem to be welcoming to a  traveling pack of people at least not from your current standpoint  liam and remind us its dim or its not super bright here is it dark  matt no its not super dark either imagine a very very very very cloudy day around sunset  laura well i 
none	 dont know what to do other than to does it look like theres anybody around us  that can see us anybody watching  matt laughs are you trying to be stealthy  laura i mean im glancing subtly trying to look like a badass but also stealthy  matt make a stealth check  laura 18  matt okay as you glance out to the side you watch as two what look to be humanoid  normalsized humans but deep red skin black hair horns curled at the front of the forehead  and folded leathery wings at their 
town	 sides begin stepping off from one of the nearby roads that  seems to go further into the city and they walk past and one of them glances over and sees you  and they both just keep walking seemingly not affected or alerted by your presence  laura okay  matt looking about each side of the road as you go there is a lot of movement through these  streets there are a lot of creatures all sorts of weird shapes you see a lot of that weird  fleshy mass that you saw stepping forward theres clusters 
none	 of them all over many of them seem to be  herded or pushed some seem to be almost chained together in places and being dragged around  laura is it like that thing we ran into in was it kraghammer where were we where that thing was  like a mash of bones and stuff  liam oh in the field of bone shards  matt oh right right  laura is it like that  matt no imagine a very very rotund person that is perpetually melting out of clay and let me  just show you a 
none	 picture actually  travis is it like a fondue pot of nine people in one  matt theres a single face  laura okay  liam its like a walking shit sack yeah  matt kind of  taliesin pizza the hutt  liam yeah  matt that right there  laura ew you cant even see legs  matt its just these like a liquified person that is just a somewhatshifting burbling forth  fleshy sack that occasionally you can see like the mouth and what looks almost like a face that  is everscreaming and writhing in pain 
none	  laura that seems awful  travis this guy needs some calcium  laura wait imma put my glasses on so i can see it again oh you already closed it  matt i can bring it back up again its all right  travis right next to that beautiful picture of a  matt oh yeah well youve already seen the other creatures before  laura oh my gosh  matt but thats your fun one there  laura that is so creepy okay  matt but theyre being herded around you see smaller creatures you see imps which 
dung	 youve  encountered before tiny winged leathery humanoid creatures that flutter around and seem to be more  keeping a peripheral view an overhead view of the goingson of each one of these clusters of  entities being pulled through the city you see a handful attending each of these that move along  these humanoid devils that have long polearms and from their dark almost like bluishpurple skin  what looks to be almost like a series of jagged pointed tendrils that jut from the bottom of their  chin and almost like writhe and curl as they push 
town	 forward occasionally shoving their weapon into  the side of these things and just getting them back on track as they wander off  laura do i see anything that looks like normal exandrians people that are just like  matt at the very at this moment no and you get the sense that at least theyre not super  common laughs almost everyone that is currently walking through the street in this particular  intersection seems to be of some sort of devilish heritage  laura right i go back to our group and say well i was spotted 
none	 for sure nobody seemed to pay  me very much mind but theres nobody here that looks like us i dont know if weve happened to  pop into a particular area of the city that is inhabited mostly by devils  but thats where we are  travis do we know what layer were in  taliesin dis would be  marisha what layer of hell its like the third fourth second  liam dis is two  travis oh we gotta find the  liam what level dis  travis open market right  laura yes the market 
tavern	  travis yep  laura oh right  marisha what  taliesin if we find the market well find an inn find an inn well find a place to drink and  get a room  travis please dont make me be the one that remembered all the shit about dis i mean i am  the grand poobah de doink of all of dis and that so  laura oh thats true you would know  travis yall motherfuckers is coming with me  taliesin oh no i can already see that going poorly  laura i feel like 
none	 we should put our hoods up and just generally act like we belong here  liam just walk with purpose  marisha do you think if i do an alter self here that people will notice  laura can you do it quickly i mean  marisha yeah i can do it at will  laura were in an alleyway  taliesin all right lets all make the changing circle  marisha yeah just shield me like were changing at the beach  laura can you just lean in front of keyleth  marisha look casual dont touch the wall 
none	 youll burn  travis ahh  matt which actually you do immediately take four points of fire damage as you do so  liam aww poor baby  marisha aww buddy  laura put some mayonnaise on it youll feel better  marisha yeah its true  travis mayonnaise squelching noise  matt so are you changing your appearance  marisha yeah im going to  laura can you imagine how sour grog must smell all the time he just has mayonnaise on him  liam curdled dairy at all times  travis or how much i love it sam 
none	 said he can cast alter self on himself plus three others  matt yes im working on that  travis okay  marisha oh he can do it on others  matt yeah people who can actually cast the spell they can cast on other people but you as a  druid ability you can only do it right on yourself  marisha oh copy cool im going to look like kind of a vague cross between whitney and zahra  matt okay and as you do that taryon immediately goes oh great idea and he turns himself  into 
none	 he pulls out a small object and clicks it for a second as it does his form shifts into an  almost identicallooking  travis female  matt laughs no a male tiefling and then goes who else who else who else would like my blessing  marisha you know hold off on that im not saying its not a good idea but maybe we should  workshop it what  laura i want to be one  matt i knew you would and he comes forward and pulls another one out and as he breaks this small  capsule 
none	 in your direction this burst of arcane energy hits you and all of a sudden your form  shifts into an almost identicallooking tiefling same colors  laura no change it up stop taryon  matt i wh okay ah and he tries to finagle with it for the last second as the spell just  about takes hold of your shape goes slightly more and he goes uh blue and youre a little more  blue its the tailend like the eh  marisha hang on hang on we dont want to be  liam no im talking it 
none	 out you can do that to how many more of us  laura two more people  matt two more  laura laughs kidding he knew  taliesin ill take one why not  laura yeah grog can look like grog  liam i feel like a handful of tieflings and grog is better than us as we are  taliesin i would agree  matt he goes ahead and takes one  laura but make him more red pink  marisha hang on hang on how long does alter self last when its just a spell because if we 
town	  were going to try and eat some food and take a break then maybe we should do that first are we  still doing that or are we just going headon into this feel like  our plans already dissolving  laura no no we need to get a we need to eat  liam yeah were in a back alley  travis heroes feast  liam we gotta walk through this town  marisha i can find it too matt  matt im looking it up hold on  marisha alter self lasts for one hour  matt 
none	 correct concentration though right  laura okay well thatd concentration  matt yeah and so  taliesin if we go into a fight it doesnt matter ill take grey  matt well by all means and he hands you the small capsule its almost like he enchants the  coins youre actually casting the spells on yourself so you are concentrating on the spell  marisha okay so i guess we will get through this city and eat a heroes feast when we get to our  destination  laura yeah and then well just alter self again  liam 
none	 so i can do this on my own then  matt yeah by all means  liam fuck it all white  laura white  matt you become an albino  travis whoa  matt  tiefling of your own intrinsic design  laura way to totally blend in  travis cool  marisha very very unique  laura good job rogue  liam do you think everybody here dresses like the raven queens butler i mean  matt you have encountered an albino tiefling before  taliesin we have  marisha have we  liam smartypants  taliesin lillith 
tavern	  laura lillith was an albino  marisha lillith  laura thats why she was so pale  marisha she was so cute  liam you can say youre sorry  laura im not  liam youre not you should be  laura im not  liam youre wrong though  taliesin right lets find ourselves a marketplace and an inn  marisha and a rakshasa  taliesin lets go i am going to step out into the street  laura act like you belong here act tough and cool  taliesin with pomp and circumstance and purpose  marisha 
none	 i join percy  taliesin please dont write things down while i do that  laura oh no  taliesin thats not nice  laura act like you belong  matt why whatever do you mean  laura people will buy it we just walk looking straight ahead dont look around too much  marisha yep yep  liam 10 what you say 90 how you say it  taliesin i act like me i think im going to be fine  liam i act like percy  taliesin hes also going to be fine  matt as you guys 
town	 step out into the main road you can see the cracked stones that make up the  walkway here even just walking through here though you feel confident in your placement the  presence here youre still getting used to and its something about the air or you feel just a  little dizzy as youre still adjusting to the heat to the placement to the strange  eversofaintly noneuclidian structure to the landscape around you its forcing you to  consciously right your posture and pay more attention to your surroundings than you normally  would theres just something 
none	 about the presence here thats unwelcoming you can see there are a  number of other streets that head in any direction its hard to tell which way is further  into the city and which is further out its so vast even the city of brass or ankharel in their  size none of them seem to really scrape the surface of the sheer immensity of the city of dis  by comparison  liam this should be easy  taliesin i wouldnt know from reading anything i wouldnt have a vague idea of where to go i have 
none	  a theory at the moment but its pretty light  matt from what you read it was mostly about the structure of the society there was no  wellwritten cartographers experience  taliesin hitchhikers guide to the city of dis i say we head to the tower  laura the towers in every direction  taliesin so whichever direction it is thats the way well head  travis wow thats true  liam so its that way  marisha and also that way  liam some people go both ways  taliesin i feel like if i were going 
none	 to build a giant tower that couldnt be ignored i would have  that be the center of anything and every place it may not even matter  liam lets take a stroll and see a lay of the land  marisha as we start taking a stroll can i do a nature check to see if i can spot any native  beasts insects etc native animals birds  matt make a nature check  marisha critters and the usual  matt sure this would be more perception actually because youre trying to pick up details  in the 
none	 scenery  marisha perception check  matt nature to understand if you knew what they were  marisha thats a shithole roll 14  matt 14  marisha total  matt you do occasionally catch what looks to be some element of small flying buzzing pests but  theyre different than what youre used to the brief glances you get of one that comes nearby it  seems to have eight sets of wings and some horridlooking pincers on the front and looks like  a nasty denizen of the scenery and immediately youre like ugh  travis i lean 
none	 over to vex and i say oi in an effort to blend in should we just  kill a random person  laura i feel like only if its called for yeah  travis i just thought of it so does that mean its called for is that what you do here  laura no probably not just yet  travis they might really like it here  laura i know they could but they also thrive on order  travis oh  laura and i feel like thats a little out of order  travis right im glad i 
none	 asked you  laura me too  travis okay  laura keep doing that  travis asking you  laura yeah  liam why is our life so much like vaudeville  marisha you do like the theater  liam thats true  marisha do you think a pass without a trace spell would be beneficial here  laura its concentration  taliesin why try to be complicated  liam lets just own this  taliesin lets own it  liam take a walk percival  taliesin no fear  liam strut  taliesin i strut  laura gasps maybe 
none	 we can drop a little bit of dust of tracelessness behind us though so  were no  taliesin no lets not make a scene im going to look for signs to look for the sorts of people who  are walking around if there seems to be a flow of traffic if people seem to be going in a  direction coming from a direction  matt okay  taliesin getting a sense of the city  matt while heading towards the tower  taliesin while heading towards the tower to make sure that i am trying to get 
town	 a lay of the land so  maybe i can see if we should veer off in a direction im also looking for humans someone  who might speak common  liam and are there stores are there businesses are these all nondescript buildings or does it  all just look like the same shit or is it  matt they are varying but theres nothing here that looks like a welcoming shopfront the  structures are varied but any of the signs or any of the scrollings that you see chiseled into the  stonework and metal is not 
none	 a language  liam so its like a hellish financial district theres just nothing there  matt loosely yeah it looks like detroit on halloween  liam purge  travis love you detroit  taliesin its been a while  matt yeah man devils night its great  liam hell  matt so you follow as dotys stomping behind tary staying as close to the middle of all of you  guys and shielding himself between your various bodies you continue to follow percival as you  step through paying attention go ahead and make an investigation check  laura 
none	 im going to keep an eye out for anybody that looks like theyre noticing  us too much anything  liam yeah same  laura of course  travis natural snitch  taliesin yes of course  marisha natural snitch  matt you are  taliesin  a problem  matt you are a problem  taliesin i may have to im aware that theres a lifespan on this die that i may eventually need  to put it away  liam we are in hell if its going to come out anywhere  travis if you roll one more 
none	 natural 20 its just going to dissolve into gold dust and float away  taliesin heads  matt its okay one of these days your contract will come to me  taliesin im well aware  liam if you lift up taliesins mohawk you can see the little tiny little points little horns  marisha yep  matt or the maze you walk for the next ten or so minutes two things you notice looking for  patterns and elements of the city around there does seem to be a general direction of not  individuals as such but a 
none	 lot of these fleshy masses which youve read about in the book  theyre referred to as lemures they are fallen damned souls that have been tortured into this  specific form that are the lowest base level of devil that exists here  marisha just a fleshy mass liam  liam i want to go to bed  matt but a lot of them seem to be going in this certain direction its difficult to maintain  focus on the direction of the tower if you have to avert your eyes however if youre looking in a  particular 
none	 direction it doesnt follow your vision when you move its whenever you  have to look away and change your perspective on the horizon thats when it appears elsewhere so  you assert yourself in a direction and maintain that way after about ten 15 minutes theres no  discernable gaining of distance on the tower  liam oh for fucks sake  taliesin in that case im going to find a lemure and inquire sternly of directions  matt okay  marisha sternly  matt as youre walking you see there are three of them currently that are chained 
none	 together with  two of these weird black jagged spiked collar and midsection bands that are jammed into their sides  and theyre all joined and the hooks and the chains are screwed into the side of this building  they do not appear to be currently attended at the moment and as you approach one is there like  gurgling  taliesin kuthok  matt pained gurgling  taliesin marketplace  matt pained gurgling  taliesin point  liam that is fucking disgusting  matt there is no language it looks like it cant really communicate  laura oh 
none	 god  marisha wow  laura thats really sad  marisha it kind of is  taliesin well thats depressing all right what building are they currently chained to  matt its about a threestory tall long tower its long on one side and then half the size on  the other and it juts up like a monolith that comes from these two hooks at the top theres no  signs or particular language on its exterior but there does appear to be a doorway a big black  metal iron doorway that is closed maybe a foot to 
none	 the left of them youre  laura does it look like people are coming in and out of that building  matt if you wait a moment you can find out  laura maybe we can post up and see or just walk on in  taliesin i wouldnt recommend walking on in  liam were walking and nothings changing do we want to stay put for a while and see what  happens  laura well our surroundings are changing were just not  matt crashing noise at this point the door shifts open with a slam theres a 
none	 burst of  phosphoroustype clouded fume that drifts out from the interior as curling down looming from the  inside another one of those large lanky skeletallooking devils with the giant scorpion  tail lurches out and sees all of you clustered over and begins to rush up quickly and grabs the  side of where the hook is jammed into the wall and just breaks it out with its bare strength and  yanks the lemures closer speaks infernal you see its jaw almost seems to disconnect and unhinge  for a moment as it gets impossibly long and 
town	 its tongue slurping noise and begins to just walk  away from you guys down the road dragging these lemures behind it from the chains  laura as soon as he opened the door i wanted to get a look inside of where he came out  matt perception check  laura it was almost a 20 but it was a 25  matt 25 you get a very brief glance on the inside very dark red light seems to slightly  light the interior it looks almost like a shelf of some kind thats as much of a view 
town	 as you got  it was just some sort of a shelf bit of furniture in the side there  laura fuck  liam hotis where the fuck are you  laura wheres a fucking place we can have a stupid feast  marisha if we can get to a safe quiet place i can do a locate creature spell and see if i can find  him i can also scry on him but i need to  laura you need something  marisha something not in this back alley of a street  liam did that devil who 
none	 just left leave the door wide open or did it shut it  matt no the door slammed open and as it walked towards you guys slammed it shut behind it  taliesin which way did the creature go  matt loosely the same direction as where you were walking for the tower  laura and taliesin keep walking in that direction  taliesin see if we can gently catch up just to the vague periphery so if i can see them then  great and if not oh well  matt are you following this group is that whats 
none	 going on  taliesin indecisive noise from a gentle long distance and not with great intent  marisha was he talking to the lemures or to us  matt talking to you guys  marisha to back the fuck off okay  matt you were clustered around apparently his charge or  marisha his yeah his people back the fuck off from my people yeah  taliesin that was a chain devil  matt no this was a bone devil  taliesin that was a bone devil all right  matt i can show you what that looks like  
town	 travis yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  marisha this means i could theoretically turn into him now that ive met them right  matt technically yeah  taliesin that wont go poorly  marisha nope  travis get the fuck out of my nightmares  taliesin minnesotan accent hello were from outta town yknow  laura marisha and taliesin minnesotan accent oh dont ya know  marisha minnesotan accent yo i got my polaroid with me  matt oh hello  all oh hello  travis and we all fall out  taliesin and we all die too 
none	 much fargo lately  matt as you tail this from a distance go ahead and make a stealth check percival  taliesin well thats 15  matt okay  taliesin im not indecisive noise keeping my distance  marisha hes drollin  laura they see me no  marisha i love laura bailing so fast  matt as you guys are following percivals lead along the roads here the heat is starting to  really crawl under your armor those of you who are wearing it youre fine grog you watch as  the lemures are dragged off into an 
town	 alley to the right  taliesin if they go to an alley then im not going to go down an alley im going to walk by  and maybe look down the alley from across the street but im not  im trying to stay on main roads  matt you make a large arc around and glance over you can see them being pulled down the alleyway  and then to the left around the corner  taliesin no that feels like a trap to me that feels like the sort of thing i would do if i  
town	 wanted to shank someone in an alley  liam ive done that actually thats true  taliesin i knew you had  laura do i see any buildings that look like people are coming in and out raucously  matt not yet no  liam what if we walked for a while and looked back lets give it ten minutes and then well  figure something out  taliesin well take a left at the next main thoroughfare  matt okay  laura hes going to keep an eye out for anybody watching us  matt perception check  laura 
town	 while im looking for buildings  liam 27  matt okay you do hear the occasional screech in the air as you see these winged entities in the  distance just screeching as they just dive through and around the top of the city  marisha do we recognise what they are are they wyverns what are they  matt no theres a humanoid aspect to their bodies but theyre just beyond the general red  glow of the city to make out their details  marisha im going to try and start focusing on that for the next walk 
none	 when one gets down close  i want to see if i can see what it is  matt okay some of them look to be imps armored imps these tiny little things that dive through  some appear to be larger some have long tails that draw behind them their giant leathery wings  and they just glide through you get a glance at one that seems to have a human torso and legs that  are hanging at its sides as it swoops through like a sentinel just watching over the city a lot  seem to be 
none	 doing arcs to and from the tower as you watch these patterns  laura i could fly up in the air and see if i can spot a market  marisha i could beast shape into something thats natural  liam thats better  taliesin is it  liam better well i dont like anybody going up  matt ten minutes travel percival by the way still not anywhere near closer to the tower  marisha weird thought what if we try to walk away from the tower  taliesin there is no walking away from the tower  liam 
town	 this is stupid what if i think about being in front of the tower  matt do you just think about it  liam yeah thats it  matt okay so you walk towards the tower but thinking about being there so you guys keep  walking for a bit you get about two blocks before you see the next major road turns to the right  and there you can see this road youve been on which seemed sparse as far as the denizens of the  city of dis as soon as this big roadway opens to the 
town	 right of you the buildings seem to grow  larger and taller and they seem to almost twist and collide the higher they get theyre all  constructed from metal and iron but theres almost an organic natural curvature at times that  seems warped causing a few to almost seem to collide and jut into each other at their peak  many of them have these big black metal chains that dangle from the outside and giant  evillooking hooks mounted onto the front of the buildings some of which currently hold lemures  that sit there and writhe 
town	 on it like a punishment for something they did in the roads themselves a  lot of them have pikes jutting up and it looks like sections of the road cracked open and there  are natural rock spikes and formations that have protruded out from the ancient construct of the  city but people just walk around them as they go and you do see more people down this way you see  more of those devillike creatures you see a few tieflings in the distance you see a few humans  you see a few fairskinned folk wandering 
none	 through you see that same bone devil that earlier you saw  emerge from the side alleyway about two blocks up still clutching those three other lemures behind  it by chain it walks up to another bone devil that seems to be sitting off to the side and is  in the process of scratching the side of its horrible bony chin and jaw it comes up to it  and they both speak and snarl you cannot read their lips because they dont really have lips  and you dont know infernal but they both almost become a 
town	 unit and walking sidebyside head  further down that path with the three chained lemures behind them glancing over you do see as  youve been focusing on the ground and around you look up and the tower has shifted position down  to the end of that roadway you thinking of it  laura was that what did it  matt no its still the same distance it ever has been in the process of losing its sight from your  peripheral due to other buildings closing off your vision as soon as you lose sight of it  
none	 entirely and reassess where your vision is on the horizon there the tower is once more  liam does it always feel like its dead ahead of us all the time  laura no its always off to the side right  matt it changes as soon as you become aware of the horizon it becomes oriented wherever that  awareness is  laura how about i watch any of the people the humanoids or anything like that that are  together can i see them talking does it look like any of them are speaking common if im  
none	 trying to read their lips  matt theyre quite a ways away from you youre not able to make out any detail  laura ill walk in the direction just get in the area that theyre in so that i can try to read  their lips  marisha once again i want to keep an eye out because i had a shitty perception check for any  birds bats beasts that i see flying  matt no birds no bats no beasts there isnt a whole lot of indigenous wildlife within the hells  it seems or at least 
none	 nothing that would be considered a beast  marisha insects  matt even the insect you saw earlier or the insectlike creature it had twisted fiendish  qualities to it on a very micro scale  liam that was an ambassador  marisha it probably was thats the thing it probably was  liam im going to trail my sister by like ten feet and watch her back  matt youre moving closer to get a view of lipreading whats everyone else doing  travis is the ground as hot as the walls are  matt it is even as 
none	 youre walking youve grown somewhat accustomed to the uncomfortable heat that  your boots are currently mustering thankfully you guys are wearing footwear designed to endure  environmental hazards or magical footwear for some of you but you imagine if you were to stand  still for too long in one place it would probably end up damaging any sort of  regular footwear worn  travis jesus its like a parking lot in texas  taliesin venice in august beach not  travis is there anything about the humans in particular are they wearing anything unusual or  do 
none	 they have any company with them that might denote why theyre allowed to roam about  matt the two that you see ahead of you a man and a woman the man has stark white hair that is  almost wet and brushed very tight to the back of the skull with a series of black and red markings  or tattoos or some sort of scar that goes across one side of his face a very very thick nose  piercing that connects to a chain that links to the back of his ear and is wearing layered black 
none	  leather armor the woman who is currently conversing with him on the other side has long  black hair with a shock of white that curls to the front her skin is a deep reddish brown tan  color and her armor is a dull gray like a clothpatterned armor but she seems to have at  her side a very wickedlooking scimitar that is hanging at her belt and she rests her arm on it  casually you look just past them and you can see they have two sacks resting on the ground as  theyre having 
none	 this conversation and a cage  travis empty  matt the cage is not empty there is something inside but youre not quite close enough to make  out any details you can just see there is a cage and some shape inside  you make a perception check  laura thats cocked deep voice 27  matt i will say make a stealth check as well this is to both get close enough to witness their  conversation but not be noticed as overtly trying to  laura 17  matt okay  laura that was bad  matt 
none	 you saddle up and instinctually go to lean on the wall and go winces this is not  conducive to your usual casual tactics but you pay attention and you catch bits and pieces of  their conversation theyre arguing about price they are both talking about how much its worth  is it even worth bringing it here weve come this far we already have the offer might as well go  through with it one of them talks about how they hate the fetters  laura the fetters  matt the fetters  travis whispers i bet its 
none	 one of those little dudes we had  matt then one of them goes lets get going this place makes me feel uncomfortable  laura i still cant see what they have in the cage  matt you can glance just barely past and you can see what looks to be some sort of a humanoid  naked you cant make out much more detail you cant tell if its male or female it appears to  be medium to lightskinned you cant get much detail beyond that  from this distance unfortunately  marisha how big is this cage 
none	  matt its maybe four foot by three foot a little smaller actually it would be more like three  foot by two foot because it looks pretty cramped  laura im going to walk up to them before they walk away  matt as they both start turning to walk one of them  laura im going to be casual as i do it i just walk up  matt you can see there is a couple of chains fixed to the front of this cage and there is a  handle of some kind that the guy lifts 
none	 there are small wheels you can now see that are fixed onto  the cage that you can now see as it rolls  laura i dont even look at the cage at all like i dont give a shit about it  and i walk up and i say  matt the woman immediately turns and sees you and her hand moves from resting on the pommel of  the blade to grasping the handle  liam same  laura oh are you with me  liam ten feet behind you  laura i signal at you to come 
none	 over i dont want to look like im talking to the people yet im  just walking in their direction and i lean over to my brother and say god i hate this place  dont you  liam yep pretty much  laura exhales its so hot i wish we were back home  liam everything fucking looks the same  laura right  liam nondescript bullshit  laura i make eye contact with the woman as i say it  matt make a subtle deception check they are intensely paranoid it seems  laura 30 no 20 21 
dung	  matt she stands there and keeps watching you the guy who was pulling the cage stops turns  around and looks you can see the chain swing and dangle for a second before coming to a stop as he  glances back his eyes irisless just dark pupils with white around them and he just not a snarl  but a very intense stare he doesnt seem to be put at ease but hes  definitely paying attention  cell phone rings  laura can i help you  matt as he silences his cell phone  im sorry 
tavern	 what  laura you were staring at me darling  matt you unless im mistaken approached our space  laura oh you had claimed it sorry everything heres claimed  matt she turns around and gives him the expression of fucking shove off and he takes the  chain and begins to tug it and they both walk away  laura that didnt go as well as i planned laughs i just want to find a fucking tavern  matt you just let them walk away  laura yeah but as they walk away i want to look at the 
none	 fucking cage and really get a good look at  what they had  matt glancing inside youre not sure how old or how young but there is a definitely beaten  wounded young man between the streaks of blood and visible gashes and lash marks the skin seems  pretty vibrant and clean this is a creature that was taken here this person was taken here against  their interest and is being dragged in a direction  laura all right before they walk off i go oi you made a deal for that one yet  matt they 
town	 turn back and look at you yeah  laura where do you go i have something id like to sell as well  matt we dont share our clients and they both just keep walking back in the  direction they were going  laura its not working im trying so hard  marisha youre doing great it was amazing  liam hey man  laura whispers oh god  liam what about i want to get off the street im tired of walking weve been walking all  matt hes about 20 feet from you  liam weve been 
tavern	 walking all day  matt hes not even turning around they are just walking away  liam are you whispering that to me  laura yes i am whispering to you it didnt work we find other people  travis i am currently spitting on the ground and watching it evaporate  matt and it does its like psh  travis ooh  laura i mean do i see a tavern around here it seems like a busy sort of street  matt laughs you can keep walking and looking for some sort of a tavern  taliesin are there 
town	 any other people around im going to give a roll  matt sure i mean there are people those are the only two humans that you had seen in the  vicinity again you saw  taliesin tieflings  matt  you saw a handful of tieflings a little even further down the road and you see a few  humanoidlike devils that are just covered in barbs and spines that seem to walk in spurts like  theyll step step and then dash a few steps and then stop and then glance around nervously and  then continue forward 
none	 roughly humansized maybe a little smaller  marisha is everyone here afraid that theyre going to be murdered at any corner  taliesin no obviously just us lets try this proper im going to start walking and  see if i can make eye contact with anything  marisha youre going to try to make eye contact with these people  matt are you guys following them or are you staying back with your party  taliesin well i am walking in their direction anyway  matt you guys have caught up to them now and percival is apparently walking 
none	 forward so  laura percy where are you going  taliesin just trying to  marisha did you notice no one here makes eye contact with you its really weird  taliesin well they did  laura i follow in the general direction of those people that walked off  taliesin yeah im going to head toward the tieflings as well which i think is the same  direction anyway so  matt yeah as you are following from a distance these two humans the two tieflings that were  conversing split off one walks across the way and vanishes 
none	 into an alley the other one joins not  the humans but seems to be walking in the same direction if maybe about 20 or so  feet ahead of them  marisha as we walk a little bit i just want to covertly heat up my hands light them up a little  bit and then touch the wall to see if it burns me as well a little bit just graze my fingers along it  matt the flames that you create from your hand are magically produced and insulated from your  body because you are the 
none	 source of their magic by the blessing of the emberstone that you struck it  does not unfortunately protect you from the searing heat from the building as you reach out  sizzle you immediately take four points of fire damage  marisha even though my mantle of the tempest i ignore extreme heat  matt you do ignore extreme heat from a general air like being on a desert it doesnt prevent  you from touching a fire and burning your hands  marisha its what i was curious about  liam stove stove stove stove ahh  marisha 
none	 sgood sgood it feels good it feels good stove cat  taliesin stove cat  matt some of the rolling clouds you hear a distant clap of thunder roll through the vicinity  as the occasional flashes of bluishwhite and green ash clouds on top of you  liam those humans are both gone out of sight  matt no theyre still in sight you guys are slowly following from a distance  laura you said they split off they split away from each other  matt the humans kept going the tieflings that he was following there were two 
tavern	 of them that were  loosely stepping in they split off one vanished into an alley the other began walking  in the same direction  liam do we talk to this guy because im about to were fucking dicking around here  taliesin im just going to ask somebody where to find a pub or an inn not trying to be coy not  trying to be interesting  liam we cant pretend shit here lets just go talk to them  marisha wait are we interesting  taliesin yes we are interesting  marisha oh  matt you 
town	 watch as three different flying implike creatures suddenly dart off the nearby buildings  and dart past you and you watch as the two humans stop and drag themselves off to the side the  tiefling that was walking not far ahead of them takes a few steps back and waits patiently as you  watch stepping through one of the adjacent roadways about three or four small devils that  have these barbed spines that stick out of their body in all directions come walking through  carrying these little spears  laura we step off to the side 
town	  taliesin i push everybody to the side and down  matt as a procession behind them you see a familiar creature you see a massive rippling  redmuscled pit fiend come stepping through  marisha oh no  laura not the one not that one  marisha its not the same one  travis he said a familiar creature  matt and the creature is familiar youre not  laura it doesnt mean its the pit fiend  matt but you see it begins lurching through the street strolling like its walking with purpose  to whatever business destination 
town	 it has but it has an entourage around it of lesser demons that  are all clearing the street as it walks you see the respect that a creature of this strength has  even within the center of this sphere of hell behind it you see a very large orb about ten  feet in diameter its a glistening golden glass and on the inside it seems to have what look to  be almost a hundred different screaming faces pressed against it from the inside that are  merging and swirling as its being pulled by these lesser 
town	 demons behind it the pit fiends  just walking like its the middle of its work day as it crosses the path the demons and the cart  continue past out of view and eventually the various entities walking the street before pick up  their pace and continue on like nothing happened  taliesin i kind of like it here  marisha i subtly as he goes by study and examine what he looks like the pit fiend  matt its very similar in size and shape design musculature as the one you battled in the city of  
dung	 brass there are a couple of pretty quicktopickout marks and changes in the bony  crest and horns on its head and the coloration on its wings go to a dark deep purple as opposed to  the bright vibrant red of the last one so it is a different entity than the one you battled you  continue walking and youre starting to notice as you follow these people forward that the further  you walk in this path and already the sides of the alleys and street corners and such were pretty  littered with broken refuse pushed 
none	 into the corners but the further you step into this the  more and more destitute and filthy the city seems to become you begin to see more and more lesser  demons just sitting off to the side just lazily looking around for some sort of impulse to kick  in and grab something thats dangling from the bottom of whatever food chain exists here you see  more lemures that are in the process of being grabbed and fought over that have just dwindled  over time like their fleshy tortured soul mass has been abused and slowly 
town	 disintegrated and has  been left to be fought over by whatever exists in this area the buildings themselves begin becoming  less these large monolithic towers of black iron and more resembling sagging stonelike swamp  structures that have a blackishpurple moss that seems to seep from the side the air almost  becomes more humid with the heat as you pass through the streets are becoming far more dense  you are seeing more humanoids of different races youre seeing more of the lesser devils coalescing  in these center spaces and you do see what appears to 
tavern	 be some semblance of what you would  call a devilish tavern there is no music there is no lively chatter but you do see what looks to  be chairs you look to see what seems to be a common area where some entities are sitting and  partaking in food of some kind  marisha as we move through the streets i just want to trail behind vax and take a look at if  anyones reacting to him unusually or taking notice of him  matt okay make a perception check  marisha dont fuck me gil 
none	 okay yeah 24  matt okay  marisha its all right its all right  matt as youre keeping an eye out the gleaming bright albino tiefling does seem to at least  have caught the eye of a handful of humanoid it looks like humans you see theyre trailing behind  you by a good hundred or so feet  marisha they are following us  matt  but they appear to be following you one appears to be a it looks dwarvish in how stout  it is but its hard to tell at this distance and the 
dung	 humanoid creature to the right of it is  humansized but it is wrapped in a wreath of dark chains that seem to cover most features the face  and the torso you can see bits of skin and muscle peeking through but its just an entire robe of  very tightlywound chains just massed around its torso and legs and arms  laura ugh this is like hellraiser  taliesin i was having a hellraiser moment  liam perfectly healthy perfectly normal  marisha does he seem to be following slightly behind in step of the  dwarvishmaybecreature  
tavern	 matt theyre staying in step with each other but you  laura oh its a buddy movie  marisha yeah buddy cop  liam its like fox and the hound  matt but theyre both very directly fixed and have been for a little while on the white  tiefling that has just walked by  liam how far is this tavern from us  matt when you notice it at this point as youre walking actually forward its about 30 feet off  marisha i come over the comms and i say hey vaxypoo i think were being followed 
tavern	 i kind of  feel like they can smell you  liam me specifically  laura well you are quite lovely brother into the tavern its up ahead  taliesin into the tavern  marisha keep an eye out its like a kind of stout maybe dwarvish man and a humanoid creature  covered in chains  laura i glance back and see them  liam thank you for the headsup im going to go in  laura yeah i stand outside the tavern with grog and wait for everybody to get inside  matt okay  taliesin i go 
tavern	 stepping inside the tavern  marisha i slip inside as well  matt okay as you guys and taryon follows suit ah doty do whatever he does he points to  grog doty steps next to you  liam what a setup  laughter  matt as you guys enter the lowburning orangishred glow of the interior shows you a slab  slate floor across you see tables that are carved from similar deep obsidian bedrocktype material  the edges of them almost hook upward and within the inside you can see a handful of these similar  spined devils 
none	 that youve seen as part of that procession earlier with the pit fiend are sitting  and ravenously feasting on some nondescript purplishred meat you can see the tables  actually are almost like troughs and the center of it seems to be almost a funnel where all the  blood and gore that is  laura ohh shuddering noise  matt  sent out from the viscera that slurps past their toothy maw is gathered and then  siphoned down below  liam out of curiosity these spined devils look like the thing we fought under kriegs house was 
tavern	  that kriegs house it was wasnt it  laura oh yeah yeah yeah  liam with the succubus  laura should we i just walk up im just going to ask for a room and just go up  matt i can show pictures of all these creatures its great  taliesin im going to stay downstairs to see if they try and come in  liam is there a bar here  travis were still outside  matt there is the ones that are currently feasting at the one table there  laura oh my god  liam 
tavern	 is there the hellish equivalent of a bar here  matt you glance thats one table there theres another table where you can see what looks to be a  deepredskinned very handsomelooking man who has black hair that fades to a very faint grey at  the tips its long and goes past the shoulders he has horns that protrude up the front hes  the rest of his body is swathed in dark black and grey cloak and you can see wings folded against  his back and he just sits there clutching a goblet at the table 
none	 usually staring into it as he  occasionally sips lost in his own thought beyond that in the corner you do see sitting  marisha me at 1 am  matt a rather rotund hes a greasy obeselooking fella whos been he has a big and  matted brown beard his hair has this curl and he has a whole series of scratch marks across his  face that just long deepset scars that leave this very marred visage and he grins this toothy  grin as you enter you can see hes just his chest hair thats exposed under 
none	 his white tunic  and his leather apron that he has over the front of that its just a very very disturbing grin  when he smiles at you as you enter and he sits up from his stool and walks over and puts his hands  down and as it puts its hands down you can see them begin to burn his skin but you can now see  these calloused fingers you can see hes been here for quite some time and has had his own way  of adjusting to the atmosphere and just leans in speaks 
none	 infernal  laura kuthok  matt kuthok  taliesin common  laura rooms  matt ah you arent from around here laughs  taliesin certainly not  marisha ermahgerd ermahgerd  taliesin ermahgod  marisha ermahgerd  matt as you say that the devilish entity that was sitting at the table slowly turns its head  over towards her  laughter  matt  and has now taken an interest in this group that has entered  travis slick  matt  sipping his wine  marisha i look back at him and i light up my fingers and i 
none	 give him the flaming finger guns  super douchey  matt he gives a nod  marisha overexaggerated nod  travis hes literally eating raw meat and blood  laura no more keyleth no more eye contact  matt well he just has a goblet but you dont know whats in it  laura do you have rooms available  matt we can provide space yes  taliesin were here on a few days business and we were hoping to find a friendly place to rest  our heads on occasion maybe take in a meal of something not necessarily 
none	  laura organ  taliesin too conscious  marisha too conscious laughs  matt he leans in and goes i can provide that dont worry howre you paying  taliesin will coin suffice  matt i suppose  taliesin if we get anything more exciting well be sure to let you know we just got here  matt one room and he puts up a thick meaty finger that you can see has its been broken in  two places and not healed right  taliesin oh god stop it matt ugh  matt three rooms and a special meal 
dung	 for the lot 250 gold  marisha wow wow vacation destination right here  taliesin im totally okay with that  liam yeah its airport prices  travis lets be honest it doesnt really matter what we think about that price  taliesin you sir is that 250 a night or 250 total for our stay  matt he gives you all a really dark look well say for the stay a few days you said right  taliesin for that 350 i think i feel that i want you to know just how grateful we are ill  put 
none	 the extra 100 out of my personal bin  matt you can see hes looking at you as youre saying this and hes contemplating you can see  theres that urge to jack it up but he keeps glancing past you occasionally and just nods and  accepts it  marisha do i notice this  laura as hes talking i turn around and lean against the table that hes talking over and see  who hes looking at  matt okay  travis does that burn you  matt you take five points of fire damage  laura well 
dung	 yeah but im going to act totally calm about it  matt you glance watching his eyeline and you can see that same dark redskinned devilishlooking  man who was paying attention to you all is currently meeting his gaze directly and gives him  a nod  marisha oh no no no this aint no hostel situation aw hell no  laura i think he might be the owner  marisha that makes sense but still still no no were not going to go in here to be sold in  the middle of the night  taliesin were 
none	 good were good  marisha are we cool  taliesin i think were cool just let it play out  laura can we insight check the guy were talking to  matt sure go for it  laura okay sure why not here we go yeah yeah thats good 17  matt 17 i mean hes hard to read but he seems to be a pretty fucking creepy guy whos giving you  rooms to stay in and seems to be making eye contact and his reactions based on some sort of  unspoken conversation with this other entity in 
none	 the room with you but he reaches down without  breaking eye contact with the rest of you as well and puts a set of three keys onto the table  theyre all these raggedlooking black iron constructs that are identical in some ways but  their handcrafted visual style shows that they have different slight changes to their designs  kind of shoves them forward towards you premium and he reaches down you hear the  clanking of some sort of glasslike instruments and he pulls up these small almost dull  graylooking spongelike stones that are about that 
none	 large kind of puts one out in front of each  of you takes the coins sighs goes and walks back  laura wait before he walks away how long have you owned this space  matt oh i dont own it i just work here  laura who runs it then  matt why you asking so many questions girl  laura im curious big man thats all  matt make a persuasion check  laura squeaking noises 18  liam she said with confidence  matt thats on a needtoknow basis sweetheart enjoy your meal he goes and 
none	 like sweatily  waddles over to his chair in the corner and sits down  marisha is this rock tartare oh my god we used to serve this all the time in the air ashari it  was a delicacy in the earth ashari  matt as you lift it and bring it towards you it seems to have this very very  faint energy around it  marisha oh i dont know if this is rock crudite  laura lets get up to the rooms i want tary to identify it once we get up to the rooms  
none	 marisha i kind of do like a  laura dont dont not yet keyleth  matt keyleth as you tap it and bring it towards your mouth you guys watch as it glows with a  faint pale yellowgreen color and keyleth you hear this faint soft wailing sound as this slight  drift of soul energy drifts off of the stone and is inhaled by keyleth  marisha oh  travis oh laughs  matt keyleth you feel a sudden rush  travis of course  matt an unexpected rush of energy your vision clarifies  liam give it 
none	 to keyleth shell try anything  laughter  laura you ate a soul keyleth  taliesin that had a name that had a life that had a mortgage  laura oh my god  taliesin he made some bad decisions and now youre eating it  matt a sudden rush of energy  marisha its so keyleth yeah oh shit  taliesin im so proud of you  matt you feel very awake your senses clarify and like a boundless surge of energy in your body  like you could do anything  marisha exhales do we are we resting

none	 next to each other theyre a little scattered as far as  the rooms only maybe ten or so rooms in the whole establishment but each room has a very  wellcrafted bed there appear to be some wellmade chairs of a similar stone material of  the downstairs setup there all having this weird jagged stylings to their construct the chambers  still hot as fuck and it is an uncomfortable interior but the bed itself does not appear to be  bursting into flames the material here is seemingly resistant to the heat in which its in  
none	 the proximity of  liam no its just a bed in new york city in july  laura i open up the bag of colding and just like put my face next to it  taliesin dont fall in  laura no i just want to breathe in the cold  taliesin dont lick it either  laura wait should we all go to one room then  liam yeah  laura and i want to look all around the room and see if anybodys watching if theres any kind of  holes in the wall  liam yeah is

none	 get her to just fall onto the bed  and stop hopping  matt falling and slamming noise percy just knocks you onto your ass  laura okay keyleth okay  matt by the way the buzz if you will the rush slowly begins to fade over the next minute or so  taryon finishes his identification and goes huh apparently these are receptacles to contain a  fragment of refined soul  marisha what  matt yeah these were once living people im going to be sick  liam i start giving keyleth  laura laughs you just ate 
none	 a person you just ate people  matt i know i kn nervous noises  marisha i go with taryon to puke  liam ooh never mind i was going to give her a scalp massage but ugh  taliesin so does the identification spell actually tell you the name of the person that you  were consuming  matt nope and im glad i dont want to i didnt i dont im sure they were a terrible  person if theyre here theyre probably a terrible person theyre probably  terrible people right  travis how many souls did

town	 the coloration of the edges of the buildings  laura oh shit thats kind of cool  marisha thats pretty cool yeah  laura dont touch doty  matt its my favourite board game  all dont touch doty  matt waiting for it  liam seems like a catholic school game  laughter  matt all right so what are you doing  travis oh my god  laura oh no were going to scry on hotis  marisha were going to scry on hotis im going to scry using my 5thlevel spell not the scrying  eye because

none	 laura im sorry im sorry im sorry im kidding kidding im totally kidding  liam here im sure it was somebody who murdered children you know  it was probably a major arsehole  laura yeah it was probably a really bad person and now theyre inside of you  marisha you know not something else id want right now no none of these things  matt what level spell is the scry  marisha fifth  matt fifth as soon as you cast the spell and center your vision on the idea of hotis the spell  immediately fizzles 
none	 and dissipates  liam son of a  marisha son of a god  matt and you begin to remember through your research of the rakshasa up to a certain level of  spells 6thlevel spells theyre immune to it  marisha damn it to the nine or second layer of hell all right  laura so cast it at a higher level  marisha so im going to try again  laura at what level  marisha im going to were in for the night yeah  laura we can be  liam thats the plan thats the intention 
none	  marisha were going to eat a heroes feast  liam all topped off at the moment so whatever you do well make up  laura do we know if the nine hells have day and night the same way  travis im not topped off i need four hit points  liam i touch grogs shoulder and i give him four hit points  matt and just like that  travis thank you  liam ticklish  matt yeah a little bit  laura does this place have day and night the same way  marisha well be eating 
none	 a heroes feast correct  laura yeah but are we going to scry first  marisha yeah  laura yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  marisha yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah im going to do an 8thlevel scry  matt an 8thlevel scrying  marisha on hotis  laura shit  matt okay  liam boom  laura eat it hotis  marisha and taliesin show me what you got  liam hodis  laura eat that scry  travis hes rolling  laura oh god he is  matt this time you grit your teeth the space is already 
none	 prepared for  the first ritual you did  marisha i also give it a good ten minutes let him get distracted and forget that he maybe just  got scryed on  matt okay you close your eyes and this time remembering both the original conflicts with him  in the quad roads the battle which you recall was at the base of a statue of dispater the  archdevil of this sphere of hell  marisha oh fuck no  matt way back when you remember him falling off the top of the balcony with vax  liam 
dung	 good times  laura and then being stabbed by scanlan  matt  and using these memories you focus on the essence of hotis your vision suddenly pulls  out of the top of this chamber that youre in to a brief glance just a flash over the horizon of  the city and there you see the ominous dark tower for but a moment then theres a flash as  your vision is pulled further into this cityscape of darkened withering alleys and the whole  atmosphere as the core of this space that you guys are heading towards 
dung	 seems to be disheveled  ruined destitute and filthy your vision is dragged in that direction to ground level then  below and is brought suddenly thrust into chambers dark bars iron doors a prison a  prison beneath the streets of the city theres another flash you see devils dozens of them  walking guards some larger than others you see a flash of large red leathery wings you see  something horned and dark grinning beyond a metal door and then beyond that door theres another  flash and on the inside you see tendrils of red flesh 
none	 extending from the ceilings and the walls  all merging to a center small core there you see this fleshy egglike structure about this large  that is suspended by these strands of muscley sinew and there you see writhing and twisting  within the membrane of this a small misshapen humanoid catlike creature that is currently  writhing on the inside you can hear the faint squealing and screaming  laura highpitched rakshasa  matt  in pain as hotis not yet fully formed slowly torturing its way back to its full physical  form is just screaming with 
none	 hatred awaiting the moments of vengeance once the torturous pain  that currently consumes its existence fades and it can once more plot its return to the prime  material plane  marisha but it was in a prison underground under the tower  liam in a faberge egg  matt underneath this portion of the city or a little ways ahead  taliesin suspended by octopi  marisha holy fuck  taliesin this is going to go great  marisha holy shit  laura anything else anything else anything else did you see anything else  matt thats all 
none	 you see you just saw flashes just leading into this you have no idea exactly  where it is all you saw were flashes of a prison under the city and hotis  still incubating in this chamber  travis weve got to get arrested  laura or become police officers  liam yeah police academy thats the thing the do  travis keyleth will get arrested no problem  marisha yeah thats true just tell me to go do something in public thats all you need all  right so im remembering it seems like hotis might serve the 
none	 devil of this realm the leader  the president as you have said a few times grog  travis dispator  marisha mmhm dispator seems like he serves him and is in a prison you know whats fun i  feel like a lot of the things we were looking for this whole time are all underground its like an  underground city man this is terrifying  taliesin what if that means its just as hot underground  marisha exhales well the good news is once we find hotis itll be super easy the bad news is  finding 
none	 hotis super hard  liam gotta find out i assume shes youve filled us all in on what you saw  marisha yeah im assuming i translated  taliesin so all we have to do is teleport through that tree thats underground we can send him a  small bonsai tree as a gift  marisha gasps oh my god oh my god  laura yeah yeah yeah then as soon as he wakes up  liam we have to find the prison  taliesin we have to find the prison find out what it is who runs it  
none	 liam and then get in get arrested get  taliesin infiltrate perhaps call a favor  marisha i have a weird feeling that this prison is run by dis lord dispater himself  liam james spader  marisha james spader  travis wait you said it wasnt fully formed right its still like in its goo phase  marisha it is  travis am i the only one that feels like this is an awful lot of trouble for something thats not a  problem yet  taliesin the trouble is once it becomes a problem it continues to be 
tavern	 a problem until you  cut it off at the root  laura he only stops when you kill him down here  liam right grog its two different sets of problems here hes a wee wee bab in a chocolate  egg but getting to him is difficult if we wait then he gets the jump on us when were sleeping in  our beds  travis not in a chocolate egg  liam not in a chocolate egg then he looks like a guy in a mascot suit at a winters crest fair  laura or like gilmore 
none	  marisha or like keyleth  taliesin or like pike  laura oh i cant even imagine hotis disguised as pike  marisha i know what a dick move that would be  liam so its now or later its just a different set of problems and now we know what were doing  at least  travis okay  marisha so  taliesin i may well im tempted to head downstairs to have a drink start scoping out and  see who might know whats what about that prison  liam i mean we know fucking nobody in this 
none	 city  taliesin no  liam and they all look like garbage so why dont we just start with the garbage downstairs  travis small question we checked in as you checked in as tieflings  laura yeah we have to realter ourselves before we go downstairs  travis for bursts of an hour each time  taliesin or we could just not talk about it and see if anyone actually notices just see if  anyones going to be rude about it  travis theres only a few rooms in this place right  marisha they keep a fairly 
none	 close eye on their patrons  travis i would think so ol broken sausage finger may be sharper than we think  marisha hmm i have a feeling there are more eyes on us here than we even realise  laura oh im sure  travis hey im really hungry can we have that fucking feast now  laura yeah  marisha yeah and i make a heroes feast  matt all righty you guys go ahead and muster the heroes feast  laura i mark off 1000 gold  liam extra hit points no fear  marisha yep  
none	 liam lustrous hair  taliesin shiny fingernails  liam shiny fingernails feel like you ate a soul  laura does that mean all of our heal our points are healed or are we just  matt well if you guys take a full rest you will  laura oh oh thats the question i wanted to ask you did we know if here  night and day is the same  matt you dont know that  laura no that wasnt in any of his books  matt make an intelligence check actually  taliesin thats 12  matt you 
tavern	 really have no idea i mean there are beds there are places to stay and from what you  can tell there are there is traffic from creatures that travel from different planes  probably require sleep so whether or not there is a daynight cycle based on any sort of  improbable sun there probably are expected daysleep cycles for creatures  that need to sleep  travis they pump oxygen in you can stay up as late as you want  matt yeah its fine  marisha no windows  matt so keyleth roll 2d10  marisha all 
none	 right  taliesin im so excited  travis come on now  marisha big money no whammies thats an eight for one and the other not as good ten total  matt okay so everyone gets a bonus of ten thats an average i guess close to average so  ten maximum hit point increase to everybody for the next 24 hours  marisha i also at the end of dinner say i would like to raise a toast to vox machina for going  and being together all the way into hell and back  laura well fingers crossed 
none	  liam well lets not get ahead of ourselves  travis we might not come back  marisha well all the way to hell and  taliesin to hell  travis here  matt thanks to the wonderful guidance of the voice of the tempest  laura okay  travis sighs oh tary  marisha oh jeez  matt keyleth of the air ashari and keep writing this down and to the majesty and the  heroic and adventurous drive  marisha yes  matt of taryon darrington  marisha of tary everybody to taryon darrington  matt to me 
dung	  marisha and with that i do inspiring leader my newest feat since im a leader  laughter  taliesin what voice is this  marisha mine  taliesin this is your leader voice  marisha this is why im a voice actor and  matt so you cheer and talk for about ten minutes  marisha yes cheers to taryon darrington and his glistening armor and his flowing locks of golden  hair and i continue for ten minutes about taryon darrington  laura wow  marisha and his glistening boots of shining upkeep and his  travis hes 
none	 losing hit points from this  laura i want to throw up  matt and the whole time dotys  marisha writing it all down and then i give temporary hit points equal to my level which is  17 plus my charisma modifier which is nothing so you get an extra 17 on that ten  matt thats temporary though  marisha temporary  laura why are we inspired by hearing you talk all that shit about tary  liam because its in the spellbook  laura i dont feel inspired  marisha well because i would hope that 
none	 with my you know tarys golden locks of flowing hair and  with my very impressive cape that i got you know for touring the world  like a frequent flyer card  matt well say for the purposes of this taryon got 17 temporary hit points  laughter  marisha what no you know what vex im still im still practicing  laura you know what its getting there next time share the compliments  make all of us feel cool  liam and all this while vax has been staring at taryon and imagining him  with exactly 
none	 half a beard  laughter  matt while taryon notices you staring intently and shes giving this inspiring speech about how  amazing he is taryon looks over at you and goes shes hitting on me  laughter  marisha with his belt that is bejeweled and his very bedazzled pauldrons and his  laura so over this part  marisha very very manicured cuticles and i dont know what else to say for  ten minutes about tary  travis are we staying in for the for a bit  taliesin on the plus side were all very tired 
none	 now  liam what else is there to say about taryon darrington  marisha dont ask me please dont ask me  matt what are you guys doing are you resting  laura i dont know should we rest i dont even know what time it is here  matt you dont  laura it could be like early morning and we could rest and then wake up in the middle of the night  travis weve only been traveling for like a few hours right  laura but it could be a completely different time here  matt yeah 
none	 but its more about your internal clock whatever you want to do  taliesin it took us quite a while to find this place  marisha ive also expended my 6th 7th and 8thlevel spells  matt it took an hour a little over an hour since your arrival since you guys did your  transformations  liam yeah we went to bed got up and then what was that  laura oh that was a burp i forgot we were filming laughs  matt yeah youve had maybe three hours four hours since waking up in the morning  
none	 liam its like noon in our internal clock probably  laura i feel like we should just fucking try to do something  travis yeah so if weve got to find our way to some sort of prison two options get arrested or  ask people where people go who get arrested which seems really fishy and stupid  marisha it seemed like it was underground almost spanning this entire city we could possibly try  and find a back entrance i dont know  liam we need to talk to somebody just talk to somebody we can walk around 
none	 for another two hours  and wait until somebody gets the heebiejeebies from us and fucks us up or we can talk to  somebody im going to talk to somebody  laughter  laura well theres the owner downstairs the creepy guy  liam ive already left the room  laura oh jesus  taliesin i follow him  laura i follow wait were not altered  marisha no youre not  taliesin no he already went down  marisha you want to come back vax vax vax vax  liam yeah  marisha youre not altered youre not 
none	 altered hey hey  liam i do a quick uturn  taliesin all right we grab him drag him back in  laura oh god  matt at which as tary goes all right doty let him through as you leave doty kind of moves  away from the door and lets you by as he bends forward with kind of the taut gesture of bowing as  you pass by you see his entire back is glowing bright red  laughter  laura tary can he heat up to the point that he doesnt work any more  matt 
none	 i hope not probably not im going to say not  laura you made him after all you would know  matt right its fine he looks over to percival right hes going to be fine  taliesin maybe flip flip sides just keep flipping the sides  matt right all right doty chest against the wall and doty just kind of pancakes against the  door a second time  travis i wish i had some bacon right now  laura tary  matt mmhm  laura can you alter self again on us  matt lets see im 
none	 going to check the character sheet that i got sent  liam youre god you can do anything  laura if were screwed we might have to be us  taliesin we might have to  matt well he can cast alter self he goes i can technically do it one more time  laura but youll be out of other things you can do  matt i will be out of all my things of the big things i mean i still can he kind of jostles  a satchel he has on the side you hear a bunch 
none	 of glass and things clinking he says i still have  my accoutrements but as far my devices to help you guys out im kind of spent at that point but  travis you know i still look the way i did when i checked in looking like me going to go and do  all the recon  marisha i can do alter self at will im just not the best person to talk to people  matt why dont we let the two of them go  taliesin inhales nervously  laura oh god  marisha are you 
none	 is that grog and keyleth  laura yes  marisha grog and keyleth havent done it for a while grog and minxie laughs nervously  travis what you and i me and the tiger  marisha yeah im not saying id be a tiger im just hearkening back to our teamup  travis but you said minxie  liam yeah but i mean i havent stepped in lava in a while doesnt mean thats something i should  right now  marisha well you know its what we call a callback you know dont worry about it  taliesin its 
none	 you know whats no i dont want to say whats the worst that could happen  whats the best could happen whats the best outcome here  liam i feel like with scanlan gone our best talker is this one  taliesin yes probably the two of us possibly  travis where are you pointing over here i cant see  taliesin yes grog  travis ive got a head of hair in the way whered you point  marisha you know grog and i can be very intimidating right grog  travis yeah but its more angry  laura 
none	 you know he might do great here i havent been doing so hot  liam yeah but you know i feel like in so many situations we go what happens if i push this  button lets just see what happens  laura lets just send grog down  liam but thats not what im saying im actually arguing the opposite of that im saying for once  maybe i mean youre a very good talker why dont we send the person whos good at talking  down instead of on a lark sending down you know the brute to 
none	 talk  laura yeah but everything ive tried hasnt worked so far maybe theyre immune to persuasion  down here and maybe all they need is a little grunts a little jostle  liam maybe you havent been lucky maybe you need to give it another shot i mean your average is a  little bit better than the big mans  marisha yeah we could go back to oldschool days and i could always go minxie  little intimidation check  travis theyre going to want to steal you and put you in a cage  taliesin im perfectly 
none	 content to just go down there and if anyone asks weve just changed into  something more comfortable  laura lets just fucking go  taliesin lets go  liam both of you youre both he can only do one person  marisha yeah are going to change into something or are you just going to be totally oblivious that  youre definitely not the people who walked in upstairs  taliesin im going to be totally okay  matt i have one capsule  laura were going to be okay he says hes got enough for everyone still  
none	 liam hes only got enough for one  laura no he can do it again to all of us  matt i can do it to one person  liam one person  travis yeah and i go down as just backup  laura its up to you percy dear  marisha and i can do it at will  liam you go you go  taliesin i dont think i do you think with the capsule or without i dont want to  laura with  taliesin fine with  marisha oh jeez someone pick who goes down and 
none	 talks i feel like grog  liam i just did percival youre going its hell this is your game now  laura with grog youre going with grog  liam sure as backup yes  matt be my guest  marisha percy and grog go go go go  matt all right so as you take the coin and you kind of focus on it fwoosh and your form shifts  back into the previous tiefling appearance  taliesin i grab a soul shard i suck it down sniffs  laura have fun storming the castle  taliesin oh lets 
none	 do this  travis oh you did a rail of soul huh okay sweet  liam he just mimics snorting cocaine  taliesin and we head down  laura did he really did you take soul  travis he did hes so causal he was like inhales then roars  laughter  taliesin inhales lets do this sucked it down like an oyster  matt and as the rush hits you you take a step and pause for a moment because the rush is strong  and familiar its similar to the sensation and the rush you had when you 
none	 took a life with the  pepperbox when orthax was still holding sway  taliesin huh  travis oh no  matt that same passage of some sort of a soul energy and as the rush hits that familiarity  itches you on the inside and youre a little caught offguard and made uncomfortable by it  liam steady as she goes percival  marisha too much  taliesin too much  marisha little much  taliesin little much  marisha little overwhelming  taliesin yes little bit  marisha okay  taliesin im going to be meditating upon that 
none	 a little bit later lets head downstairs  laura come back please  liam i place my hands on grogs shoulder and percivals shoulder and cast bless as they walk  out the door  matt okay you guys head out into the hallway  laura i smack both their asses  matt smack noise  liam you dive in front of me to do that  laura yeah  matt laughs and taryon goes inhales deeply laughs he gets weirdly uncomfortable all right  so you guys head back downstairs the two devils that were there feasting earlier appear 
none	 to have  left and the room is mostly quiet and empty now except for the same roughlooking bartender in the  corner and there at the same table is the redskinned devilish handsome gentleman as you  walk down you see what appears to be a small impish creature thats on his shoulder and hes  currently conversing with it quietly and then as you guys step down he waving noise to it and  it flies up and skitters off into the distance outside of the door turns to you reaches over  and takes a bottle off 
none	 the table and fills the goblet  travis what comes out of the bottle  matt it appears to be some deep red liquid  laura ugh  liam its merlot  laura oh yum  matt hes watching you but hes not expecting any interface  taliesin i walk over clears throat could i possibly entertain you with some company  matt it would it would be a change of pace that is quite welcome take a seat both of you  travis okay  matt the seats as they theyre heavy and theyre not quite as theyre heated 
none	 at the base  theyre warm to the touch but theyre not burning you you both pull them up and they grind against  the slate stone floor of the interior as you plop down and sit shall i also fetch you a drink  taliesin that sounds lovely what is actually available at this hour at this establishment  matt available at the establishment not this kind of drink my personal reserve  that i can offer  taliesin i would be curious i would hate to be indebted to you at this point but i would be very 
tavern	  curious to try whatever it is that you consider to be your personal stash  matt i would prefer you indebted to me  marisha jesus  matt and he lifts a finger and the gentleman at the far edge of the bar stirs grunts oh right  and chris farleys his pants a bit  laughter  matt comes over with two similar goblets and places them on the table and steps back to the  corner the gentleman takes the bottle and fills them both kind of finishing the last bit he had  in grogs chalice 
none	 and sets it to the side  taliesin what may i call you  matt you may call me ipkesh what may i call you  taliesin ah freddie will do for now  matt freddie  travis greg  matt freddie and greg  laughs god damn it  taliesin broke the dm ten points boom  laughter  taliesin fuck souls thats a rush  liam two points for gryffindor  marisha oh man buddy cop go  matt so what brings you to my fine establishment  travis what does the chalice smell like  matt smells 
town	 like a strong alcoholic wine of some kind  travis i take a big old sip  matt its good its very good youre not a big fan of wine generally because youre more of a  liquor and ale person but as far as the wines youve had its pretty good  liam your pancreas melts  travis this im sure you know is really good  matt it better be so what is your business  taliesin honestly cards on the table were in town because a friend of ours got in badly with a  rakshasa  
none	 matt chuckles this is not an unfamiliar tale  taliesin we figured not and were definitely out of place a bit out of sorts and definitely out  of our depths but thank you for the rooms i assume this is your establishment is it not  matt i run it at the how do i say a partnership with my betters  taliesin i think i understand take another sip ah well regardless of betters or otherwise im  grateful for the sanctuary all of us are so we i assume are not the first people youve met  
town	 coming into town looking for a rakshasa  matt i have not met them but stories do swirl and find my ears it does all of us well here to  know whats going on  taliesin well i will admit we have some questions  matt well perhaps i have some answers  taliesin weve heard of a would you call it a prison an underground series of cells beneath  the tower beneath the tower beneath the city thats where we think we might find our boy  matt there is a prison here yes i know it 
none	 well  taliesin you know it well i would hope not from personal experience  matt oh no no it imprisons many things but i would be blunt with you as well we live here  under the interest of business yes  taliesin i understand  matt information is a resource  taliesin a very very great one there is a prison underground people go there perhaps this  is an easy question to ask that will flow freewy freely what is this  why do people get sent to that prison  matt what do you have to 
none	 offer for my information  taliesin what are you in the market for i have dull things but i get the distinct impression  youre not necessarily somebody whos going to be interested in coin  matt i prefer not to dole out small tidbits i prefer to bundle in larger packages  taliesin i understand how do i know that what you have to offer is worthwhile  matt i can  taliesin i have a proposal  matt hm tempt me  taliesin obviously were interested in the prison were interested in somehow getting into  the prison 
none	 or possibly getting our problem out of the prison im not saying that were looking for  some sort of grand mastermind or otherwise but if you feel that youre the sort of person that would  have enough information in this direction of how one might get access to the prison or otherwise  and get out with their skin intact at least most of it or the sorts of people who would be  interested in helping such an adventure go forward that would be  worth our while and interesting  matt brings up a hand and 
dung	 snaps his finger as it does the entire room around both of you goes  dark jet black you still see the table before you the drinks in your hand the gentleman across  the way but everything else around you just goes complete lightless umbra expanse  travis i had too much of this wine  taliesin i dont think ive had enough  matt if were to speak freely its best that we speak in a place that is safe to speak  marisha oh my god he fucking teleported you guys away somewhere  matt my cost 
none	 for my information is high but i can both give you what you seek and the means of  achieving what you want but i want a favor in trade  taliesin and i hope if youre willing that if we decline your offer i hope you will take no  offense  matt i will take no offense but those that listen might  taliesin thats fair  matt what im trying to say is it behooves you to make this contract so what you seek is the  mentiri the mentiri is the prison beneath the city i 
none	 can tell you more i can get you there i  can probably even find out who there knows of or is involved with this rakshasa and this favor i  ask will lead you to this path he leans forward after taking a big sip of his wine finishing the  last of it setting it aside with a heavy poof on the table i work for utugash one of the  prominent owners and taskmasters involved in moving souls and soul goods throughout this area  of dis he is slovenly he is lazy he is powerful and 
none	 he needs to fall  taliesin is he a pit fiend  matt at one time maybe at this time his laziness has left him a useless sack of demon  shit and i have bent under his fist and brow for far too long i have friends now in other places  and if his business were to crumble that void left behind could elevate me and my compatriots  taliesin of course  matt now i have friends in this prison and the offense of travelers tearing down someone of  prominence and yourselves being still within your 
none	 very mortal coils why thats what this prison is  designed for for those that break the laws of the land but havent yet passed to be ripened to be  kept until they do once the corruption has set them for the rest of our factory so you slay  this creature i can see that you are safely arrested and placed with allies on the inside that  could move you around and bring you fairly close to this rakshasa you seek that is my offer  taliesin this is a fair offer i will quietly without naming 
none	 names of any kind confer with my  compatriots and we will give you a yes or no without naming names of any kind  matt very well  taliesin before we leave and just as a personal favor ive been touched by a demon before by a  creature does it show here can you see  matt he gives you a strong look  taliesin im going to pull hex up on myself  matt at which point you see his expression change and he rears back and goes it doesnt  show but the blood ward leaves 
dung	 its scar on many who exist here your essence is not of the abyss  i would not worry but do be careful in flashing such power  taliesin im thankful my last question this taskmaster of yours the name you gave me is it  his true name  matt no true names now that is an expensive trade  taliesin one would hope would have made our job much easier  matt and mine long ago  taliesin fair we will meditate upon it  matt i will say beware the whisperers the goldenarmored fliers the watchers of 
tavern	 the  archdevil himself his paranoia seeks to know everything that goes on and should such treachery  that we talk of be revealed well that would a very unfitting end to me my compatriots and  every one of your friends  taliesin i will not speak your name in public i will not speak your name in private to be honest  youll just be our friend downstairs for now  matt avoid the whisperers he snaps again and the sphere of darkness fades and youre back in the  tavern unmoved  travis anybody looking at us 
none	 strange  matt no the one person in the room there the rather bulky fellow in the corner seems to be  halfasleep almost like sleepy lip smacking  taliesin we finish our drinks keep an eye on the door see if that strange dwarflike creature  shows up  matt you finish your drinks over the next couple of minutes or so it wasnt a heavy pour ipkesh  just intensely with a slight smile looks you both over as you all quietly assess your positions in  the discussion no sign of that individual you saw earlier  
none	 taliesin all right  travis ive made up my mind  taliesin well the rest have to do the  travis no no its you and me down here  taliesin no were going up  travis if you want your glasses back we decide here and now  taliesin thats fair lets head upstairs  laughter  travis damn it  taliesin we head up  laura howd it go  taliesin well our friend downstairs says be careful of what you talk about out loud its  pretty standard  travis apparently people are listening to everything  
none	 laura like in here  taliesin probably in here  laura oh  travis so no names no specifics  laura god its good to be so cool  taliesin well its pretty typical  matt doty is writing that tary goes dont dont write that down  travis how many empty soul stones did she have while we were gone  laura ive had none this place is just so hot  liam so we switch back to little elf boy little elf girl antlers greg  taliesin i definitely would recommend everybody not use their real names thats 
none	 something i  shouldve pointed out earlier nothing here is using its real name  laura did you ask him if you dont look like a tiefling if people are going to notice  taliesin i didnt but i asked him some other things  travis i dont think it matters though  taliesin i dont think it matters either  liam what did you find out  taliesin well theres a prison underneath the city  marisha yes knew that  taliesin our friend says he can probably very likely get us in there and get us close enough 
none	 to  deal with our problem  laura all right  taliesin i believe him  marisha whats the catch  travis we gotta kill someone  taliesin its the typical catch we have to do him a favor  travis and then get arrested for it  taliesin or hell arrange for us to be arrested  travis i understood that we kill him then when we go to the prison he knows people in the prison  who would make sure that we find our way to the right places but thats the shady part  liam who 
none	 do we kill the person you just spoke to  taliesin no  liam someone else  taliesin someone else whose name i will not say out loud for now  liam okay but you know it  taliesin yes  liam all right  laura all right how would we do that  taliesin well how do we ever do anything laughs  marisha and why does he want this certain someone killed im sure its out of politics  taliesin sure  marisha all right  travis business  marisha business  liam its just evil versus evil 
none	 here  taliesin yeah its really actually quite convenient that theres no such thing as the right  thing to do it just sort of takes so many things off the table here  liam mm youre not going to throw a rock and hit an innocent person in this city  taliesin no the rock is probably the most innocent person that youre going to throw  laura what if somebody threw a rock and hit us were quite innocent  liam right right  taliesin it would be a contract we would be  laura well tary is 
none	  marisha a contract  taliesin everything here is a contract  marisha but tarys exclusive he cant sign any more contracts  matt thats true you told me that  taliesin he would not be signing the contract  laura whispers dont say his name  marisha i mean barry barrys exclusive  taliesin barry barrington  marisha laughs barry barrington  matt i dont like this at all  taliesin chin up barry laughs  marisha barry barrington laughs  taliesin chuckles its better than  matt dont write that either  taliesin  perry paddington  liam 
none	 berenstain bear  taliesin barry paddington is actually has got a nice ring to it  travis well if weve got your code name whatll we call you  taliesin and laura freddie  travis freddie right  laura i wouldnt know that  taliesin and greg  liam is that i mean that kind of is your name is that all right  taliesin its not really its a bit of it its off  travis i still like droll but whatever  liam drolls good  taliesin drolls fine just dont use any real first or last names 
none	 nothing you would sign to a  piece of parchment  travis freddie how do you feel about this plan  taliesin i feel good about it i feel like its a terrible idea  travis right but do you have any amendments to it would you change it somehow  taliesin i would just confirm with someone of reason that were to do this and get arrested for  it or were to do this and otherwise  laura oh my god how wonderful would it be if scanlan could just dimension door oh i  shouldnt have said 
none	 his name could just dimension door down to that thing to the room and just  slice up the little egg and then  travis whos to say where hes going  laura  bamf out  taliesin well we cant can we  laura probably not  liam also im not trying to prevent us from following this plan but we were warned not to  make any deals with any creature  marisha we definitely made a deal between ourselves before we came down here no contracts  no deals  travis right  taliesin i didnt agree 
none	 to that  liam so the first thing we do is  marisha make a contract  taliesin well look at where we are to be fair i sort of knew we would have to  marisha but do we need help getting arrested im kind of with grog all i have to do is walk out  into the square and open my mouth and then ill get arrested  taliesin do we just want to get arrested or do we want to actually end up where we need to be  travis so my thought right is that 
none	 i think we have to be arrested breaking into a prison seems  real tough at least with this guys plan if hes lying the worst we get is just straightup  arrested which i would assume means all our toys get confiscated right  laura probably  travis so not all of us go on the killing  marisha a couple of us go and get arrested  travis yeah and if hes a man of his word then those people that are in get led along to this  magic place where you can go and smash chicken 
none	 little  marisha and the rest of us can follow along  travis but if hes a lying piece of shit like im sure everyone else is were going to need  someone on the outside  taliesin i get the distinct impression that most people here are painstakingly honest which is the  horrifying thing about a place like this  travis really  taliesin i think that they that theres a lot of lying by omission  liam i have a thing might be helpful while were here  laura what is it  liam its a little 
none	 vial of oil of etherealness the oil can cover someone of my size maybe  scanlans size and it lets you  laura no scanlan laughs well hes not here  liam lets you walk through the ethereal plane for an hour so you can sort of bypass where you are  marisha whispers its like wearing the ring the one ring  liam little bit yeah  laura like you walk through walls  liam yeah i mean youre walking on a whole parallel  marisha dimension  liam the way it was explained to me on this piece 
none	 of paper is that you are parallel to where  you are  marisha i will say having  liam cant pick anything up i dont think cant  marisha  having truesight if anything has truesight like the archdevils  liam yeah  marisha im pretty sure they can see into the ethereal plane with truesight but thats only  the archdevils who might have it but it is illusory magic im pretty sure  matt how does it say it on the item  liam well its the effect of the etherealness spell for one hour  matt 
none	 oh right and so for that the specifics on that  liam i was trying to sprinkle fairy dust on it but lets just go to the rules shall we  matt lets see here 4th 8thlevel  marisha cause i think anything with truesight can see into the ethereal plane i think  liam this is like nazgűl ky  matt kind of it says you remain in the border ethereal for the duration or until you use your  action to dismiss the spell during this time you can move in any direction you can see and hear 
none	  the plane you originated from but everything there looks gray so yeah its like the one ring  but you can shift in any direction you can only  marisha is it considered illusory magic  matt no transmutation  marisha it is transmutation  matt while on the ethereal plane you can only affect and be affected by other creatures in that  plane creatures that arent in the ethereal plane cant perceive you cant interact with you  unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so you ignore all objects and 
none	  effects that arent on the ethereal plane allowing you to move through objects you perceive  on the plane you originated from  laura god i really wish we had the stones with us now  liam yeah but its a this is a slowmoving oneway ticket  matt yes  liam its an hour  laura yeah but  liam so i could use it  laura i mean you could find your way down there  liam right or if we get trapped one of us could lather up and get out i mean i dont know 
none	 what  we dont really know what were dealing with yet but its just good to know that we have it in our  back pocket  taliesin well  marisha i mean with shapechange i can change down to one of these little weird eightwinged  insects weve seen flying around  taliesin imps imps  travis and do what  marisha get in  liam then change into something bigger and squish the egg  marisha yeah  taliesin you cant think they wont notice that youre an imp that doesnt belong to anybody  laura no not 
none	 an imp its an insect  marisha the little insects that have weve been seeing flying around that might be little tiny  very tiny imps i dont know  liam i mean its not a bad idea lot of variables but its a pretty good idea  matt do keep in mind when you shapechange you maintain the hit points of whatever  marisha of whatever i change into so if i get down there and i get caught  laura youll bamf into yourself  marisha ill bamf into myself so the way shapechange works is whatever i 
none	 assume first we  need to clarify this later not now cause its like whatever you had before is what you have so  do you just have 1 hp the whole time based on whatever you changed into first  matt yes so if you turn into a dragon with 300 hit points thats great the next thing you turn  into cannot have more than 300 hit points  marisha right but if it goes down  matt if it gets damaged down to say ten hit points and then you turn into a different kind of  
none	 dragon that dragon will still have ten hit points  marisha sure  matt or if you turn into a fly that has one hit point max and then back into a dragon itll be a  dragon with  marisha and matt  one hit point  matt you cannot regain hit points by changing forms with the spell  laura oh wow  marisha but its whatever i had before so i cant change into something awesome then change  into something less awesome  taliesin crappy and then back into something awesome  marisha  and still 
none	 have its hit points  matt you can do it but youll whenever you squeeze through to the tiny hit points those  carry over into the big creature  liam so youre saying you dont bring your 300 dragon hit points down into the fly body you  switch to you switch to fly hit points  matt unless its the last resort or you have a way out yeah  travis i think we go perform the hit and then we leave tary i mean barry to get arrested right  matt just well no were going to 
none	 do that all of us right  travis like supersecret spy no this is a very privileged role  matt really  travis yep bigtime machoman stuff  matt are you going to get me out of the prison  travis yeah  marisha prison breakstyle itd be so dramatic  laura i just dont think we should do that to barry  travis hes ready for more responsibility right  laura i really dont feel like he is  matt i think she might be right in this instance but if were going together and you  guys stay 
none	 around me were a team right thats what teams do we do things as a team vox  machina  laura dont say our name dont whisper  matt grox dockinda stop writing it down doty  marisha box cockina  travis really  liam whompwhomp  taliesin so do we say yes to this  laura oh dear lord  liam to doing the hit and then going to prison  taliesin well what else are we going to do  liam right no im not arguing  travis sings dont say no to this  taliesin i say 
none	 yes  travis yeah me too  marisha we can also always yeah all right wait what did we just agree to  laura to killing an archdevil  travis and taliesin no  marisha were taking this contract  matt not an archdevil  liam wait a second wait a second when you peeked into hotis  matt killing a greater devil theres a big difference  travis archdevil is the pope of this area  liam when she peeked im asking keyleth but you might need to come in here with detail when  you peeked in at 
none	 hotis what like how much security was around him what was around him  matt didnt really see  liam didnt see just saw a cadbury egg  matt flashes of interior  marisha it comes in pulses  matt  and like bff and then all of a sudden  travis definitely something big with big red flashing wings though  marisha yeah yeahyeahyeahyeah yeah  archdevil or no hard to say  laura could be like a pit fiend or something  marisha im getting the idea that maybe hotis serves dispater dis  liam dispater yeah  
none	 marisha yeah dispater yeah kind of think he serves him so were kind of maybe going in to  kill one of his literal secret spies think its kind of whats going on  liam yeah thats what were doing  so kill the thing get arrested possible bug keyleth possible ethereal keyleth as ways to  get in and out possibly  marisha i mean i can always beast shape there then have shapechange later you know i can do  the whole be a flying squirrel in someones pocket like weve done before type of thing  liam 
none	 yeah i mean once we kill this thing which we will were diving into the unknown  travis do we all want to kill the thing  taliesin once we kill this thing we plane shift out of here faster than you can say oh oh were  liam not hotis the contract to get to hotis thats the owners  taliesin that well confirm with our friend that well confirm with our person and seem  like i dont want to use that term too loosely well see what would be most advantageous for  getting what we want 
none	 out of this situation  liam all right so he gets what he wants and then we see if we get what we want  marisha how easy is it going to be to kill this  laura it wont be easy lets be honest  marisha  mysterious person  laura this is going to suck  liam yeah i mean we had a fucking nanny who used to tell us nightmare stories about this its  way worse than she described it  taliesin pit fiendish  marisha so wait were expecting two of you to kill something 
none	 pit fiendish level  taliesin no all of us  marisha i what what is happening  taliesin all of us were going to kill this thing  marisha so we all kill the thing and then two of you get arrested and then the rest of us follow you  taliesin and liam all of us get arrested  marisha were all getting arrested now  liam yeah mmhm  matt thats much better  marisha what happened to like two of us getting arrested  matt thats much better i like that plan  travis explain to me 
none	 about the contract so in the contract if he doesnt hold up his end of the  bargain like he explodes or something right its a magic contract  taliesin it will quite possibly be a magic contract  laura youre not going to have to sign anything yeah  travis because if we get arrested and they take all our goodies and were in a cell im going to  kill all of you with my bare hands  taliesin were going to ask him this downstairs i just want to take it to you and see if everyone 
none	  thinks that were going this direction well make the most comfortable deal we can but honestly  im very curious if anybody has any better ideas  matt weve already gone to hell lets also go to prison  marisha we could try and just straightup espionage  travis prison assault  marisha  stealth this prison assault and i could do a locate creature and we could just  figure out where hotis is and try and completely yeah prison break this  without signing any contracts  taliesin fullfrontal assault on a demon prison in the basement 
none	 of  marisha im not saying fullfrontal im saying  liam well walk us through it again walk me through it again one more time  marisha were stealthy motherfuckers right  travis we dont know where the prison is  matt tary raises his hand slowly doty put your hand up  laura these are the least stealthy people i think ive ever seen and we know pike  matt i mean no offense big guy but  travis what  matt nothing  laura hes quiet  matt nothing  laura hes really quiet  matt su nothing 
none	 at all  laura his boots are made of fur  matt i know theyre beautiful did you make those  laura theyre very quiet  travis no  liam but you two kerry are very loud is what youre saying  laura yeah  matt squeaky voice i get nervous  marisha barry is there any way that you can like sighs condense doty put him in your po no  liam i mean reality is two of us are stealthy everybody else is mediocre or worse  marisha im really good okay really good i know youre talking 
none	 about you and your sister but  im really good too just want to point that out  liam okay  taliesin lava  marisha fuck off percy fuck off  liam wow  marisha that had nothing to do with stealth that had straight only to do with dexterity which is  not my strong suit  travis hey beekus you just said his real name  marisha sighs freddie fuck  travis so hey freddie like how long do you think guy downstairs will give us to decide  taliesin i figure well if were going to do 
none	 this i think we should do it quickly  laura oh my god  liam probably listening to us  marisha no theyre not im getting  travis not supposed to make any deals we could just try and do it on our own the deal might put  us in a position where were totally fucked  taliesin it might  travis we dont even know where the prison is  marisha whispers but we could find out  travis you think  laura can you cast locate creature right now  marisha yes yes i can  laura 
none	 just cast it and see  marisha i 100 can  liam and laura lets do it  marisha i fucking cast locate creature  matt okay  liam see part of our problem is sometimes always we grab the first opportunity in front of  our fucking faces so  travis isnt that the way life is  liam lets explore this opportunity  taliesin what level are you casting locate creature at  liam 27  marisha level its a level two a level four spell  matt yep  taliesin will that work on him  matt 
none	 you cannot cast it at a higher level well you can cast it at a higher level but theres no effect  marisha it doesnt do anything  taliesin okay i was curious if he has a blind spot or not  matt all right so you take a moment you finish casting locate creature you concentrate once  again on hotis keeping a very clear image of what you saw in the scry spell as you complete the spell  liam hodis  matt  nothing  marisha what  laura because its a level fucking four  taliesin 
none	 its all right  matt well the creature has to be within 1000 feet  laura oh  marisha and it has to be within but it lasts for an hour its a concentration spell  matt it is  travis just take off running around the city man boom marathon woman go get it  marisha i can fly i can look and fly  taliesin turn into an imp  travis sings shes a maniac man oh hes down there  marisha i could go right now and fly around while it lasts for an hour do a 
none	 quick scout  travis how do you fly  marisha with fucking beast shape by being like a beasty thing  travis can you do that and concentrate at the same time  marisha yeah thats atwill  travis yeah sure off go on fly off by yourself nobody cares  liam ill go with her  travis how do you go  laura youre not a well it doesnt matter  liam im not what what am i not  laura a tiefling anymore  marisha yeah  liam i know but shes a big fucking bird i mean

none	 imps  laura those are the golden armored things  marisha the gold armor imps  matt there are impish creatures with golden armor that you saw at a distance in the sky above  laura was there anything else flying other than them  matt there were other creatures flying but they were too far away to really make up any decent  and some of them of them were just imps just the tiny little devils that fly around and there were  some that seemed a little larger with humanoid bodies and giant leathery wings that were 
none	 just  coasting through  liam and you said this is like the biggest city weve ever seen  matt yeah  marisha there are things that fly here  matt there are many things that fly the first thing you saw when you looked up in the sky was at  least a dozen or so winged creatures all up in the clouds  laura oh god  marisha i can go going to the window anyone stopping me  laura theres no window its just wall  marisha theres no windows anyone stopping me as i alter self 
none	 and  travis this is your game go for it  marisha  head towards the door no  travis do it  marisha no one all right im going to go do a quick pass laughs  liam oh gosh be careful  travis have that backup character ready  laughter  laura she becomes leader of the ashari and dies as soon as she gets to hell  taliesin one day  travis go get it keep going momentum  marisha all right all right all right all right all right im going to shapechange  matt youre

none	 zone  marisha just a straight oh thats good thats good 20 total no no 21 total  matt okay  marisha i forgot my proficiency bonus went up  matt as you exit the building and turn right and into the alleyway being careful not to be seen in  your tiefling form begin to cast the spell as you see two shadows step into the  entranceway of the alleyway  marisha nope i stop it  matt okay so you stop it  marisha yep and i just kind of keep walking  matt you just keep 
none	 walking okay you dont even look back you just keep walking  marisha yes  matt okay keep walking and you hear footsteps behind you  marisha i start blocking around  matt okay as you go blocking around the footsteps seem to be keeping pace with you  theres two sets of them  marisha peek over my shoulder do i get a glimpse on who they are  matt you see what appears to be a squat kind of tanskinned dwarflike figure  marisha its the dwarf again  matt the features like you expect to see a 
none	 dwarf appears to be a female dwarf of some kind  but theres some sort of physical alterations taken place they look like theyve been either  very injured and healed wrong or some sort of corruption has taken place but its walking  forward with this hobbling gait and to the left you see the other entity that is just wrapped in  chains and theyre about 30 feet behind you  marisha 30 feet behind me  matt about 30 feet behind you yeah  marisha are we alone  matt its just you and the two of 
tavern	 them right now just in this small alleyway off in the building  thats immediately adjacent to the structure where youre staying  marisha im still i imagine within range of the tavern  matt yeah  marisha just gonna say im being followed so be on alert same dwarven chainy figure  laura should we come out  liam do you need us out there  marisha no just wait a second ill say jenga if need be  taliesin stretching  marisha i stop aboutface and light up my hands and keep the hood up and just say 
none	 i know youre  there what do you want and who are you keep the hood up  matt heads down the footsteps slow when they get about 20 feet from you and they stop you  keep your head down the dwarf figure brings one weird swollen twisted arm in front of the other  crosses it the chained figure you hear all the jangling shifting and as you get a better glance  over your shoulder towards it you can see the chains that dangle dont just dangle theyre all  kind of slowly shifting and spinning around 
none	 like hundreds of small snakes that are just readjusting  and moving across the body you can see its eyes part of its nose through as the chains pull across  and hide most of its features the skin itself a deep deep pinkishred like a normal body thats  been constricted so much that all the blood has rushed to the surface  marisha offthecuff do they seem familiar any idea on who they might be  matt no but there is a heavy breathing from the female dwarf figure that just they glance at  each other  
none	 marisha i say do you want to tell me you want to tell me who you are cause i dont have a lot  of time to deal with this  matt the chained one says you seem to walk with a white one  marisha whos asking  matt i am asking  marisha i could be referred to many people including myself so i am asking  matt silence you will bring us the white one or you will be tribute yourself  marisha what do you want with him  matt theres no response  marisha i 
none	 dont think youd want me as tribute so youd best bet tell me what you want with him  because maybe we could strike a deal  matt the white one caught the attention of a creature that i wish to see pleased  marisha well is this creature willing to make a deal because the white one belongs to me  matt you have ownership of the white one  marisha of course  matt make a deception check  liam its not really lying  marisha laughs its not really a not great six total  laughter  
none	 marisha its not entirely wrong though  matt hm you hear the chains intensify with the rattling and clanking perhaps you should walk  with us  marisha where are we going  matt to the one who wishes to now know of your ownership  marisha and if i decline  matt then you will no longer be able to stop us  marisha im sorry i still didnt catch your name  matt you do not need our name  and thats where were going to leave tonights episode  all groan  marisha oh what  taliesin

none	 game every week  laughter  matt just in case  travis multiple bags  taliesin we can leave them here now  matt im doing that  marisha i didnt burn the spell right i stopped it i didnt burn the spell i stopped it right  because i was like cancel cancel cancel come on man  taliesin my vibe is it didnt burn  marisha i thought it didnt burn either  matt i will say just for the sake of this for the sake of this roll will determine this  roll whats your passive perception 
none	 actually  marisha my passive perception  matt yes  marisha pretty good  taliesin youve got to do something about that thats becoming a problem  marisha shut up  laura shut up laughs  marisha 21  matt 21 ill say you cancelled it you did manage to just catch their movement out of the  corner of your eye just as you entered the alleyway and you just as you were about to  begin the spell they arrived  marisha all right  matt thats only because they didnt roll very high stealth themselves well cool
