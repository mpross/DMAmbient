matt then lets go ahead and dive into tonights episode of critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back last we left off our group of adventurers had found their various individual  fates come together here in the city of trostenwald where they had attended a carnival  that had blown into town had watched a horrible occurrence happen where one of the older attendees  transformed into this terrifying zombie creature upon defeating it you were all put under  investigation as possible culprits for the reason that it occurred in /none/ trying to wander the city to  investigate and try and clear your name you eventually found that there was a fiend hiding  amongst these carnival workers this large devillike toad creature which through some  research you had found to actually be called a nergaliid had killed two more of the guards  leaving you to fend with their transformed forms and then fled deep into the center of the ustaloch lake  clattering offcamera  matt thank you for the punctuation upon gathering your supplies after a nights rest you  managed to through the trade of /none/ a bottle of wine get passage across the lake onto the central island  which at one time housed the abode of a witch that had long collapsed waiting for nightfall you  approached the center of the grove that existed there on the island and found near this ruin this same fiendish  nergaliid as well as toya the 12yearold dwarf girl who had been affixed to him for the  performances in the carnival you did battle with this large fiendish entity who summoned a cluster  of imps and managed to knock a few of you pretty /none/ heavily to the ground before you finished it off  we left off as you all were finishing licking your wounds catching your breath and now as the  moonlit night gets its darkest in the sky you figure out what the next step is in gathering means  of absolving yourselves of suspicion as youve all now taken a moment to yourselves you can hear  the sound of the nearby crickets getting more and more deafening as the silence crawls over the  center of the lake toya the young girl still lies unconscious the remains of the /none/ devil toad  still partially burnt from the final blow delivered by fjord are mostly intact above its  shoulders head and its legs what would you like to do  travis ow were all fucked up  laura does anybody need any healing  sam oh are you alive right now  travis were up just barely  laura you need some  liam im really shabby at the moment  laura oh thats too bad because i dont have any spells left  liam thats good lets go back and talk to the cops  laura should we /none/ do something with this body  taliesin i think we need to bring it i think were going to need a trophy  liam what about just its head  taliesin thatll do  travis its a big head it might be all we can take  laura i dont know if itll fit on the boat would it fit on the boat that we came out on  matt how much of the body  laura the whole body  matt the whole body with all of you could probably fit it doesnt have the usual you  could /none/ probably fit it  sam how about just the head  matt the head it would probably do but the full body id have to make a few rolls  taliesin im going to give the body a quick search to see if theres anything  matt you already did  laura yeah i got a bunch of rings see  taliesin do i recognize any of these rings  matt no you do not  taliesin all right thats disturbing  sam i got one too  travis has the head been damaged at all or is it mostly /none/ intact  matt its mostly intact there are a few gashes on it from the general fray but for the most part  its still a solid head  travis molly youve got them impressive swords you want to do some hacking  taliesin suppose i should  marisha id say you have a pretty impressive sword too  taliesin im going to try and carve off the head  matt okay its a tough form not only is the exterior of its flesh blubbery and a heavy  rubberlike substance that is glistening with whatever mucuslike liquid it naturally /none/ produces  but then beneath it the muscle sinew is extremely tough it takes you the better part of 20 minutes  to finally get the head entirely off the rest of the torso it weighs enough to the point where  youre going to need one or two other hands to get it anywhere  travis thats an artiste at work right there  taliesin this is as far as i go one this one thats way too heavy for me  liam its all you blue  marisha ill help you out  taliesin im going to grab /none/ toya  laura and marisha groaning  laura is toya waking up at all  matt toya is passed out youd have to try and rouse her  laura its probably best not to wake her up while were carrying this head around  taliesin i think thats a very good idea  marisha yeah this is frightening  liam the imps burned away  matt yes they turned to ash  laura does he have hair what are we carrying him by  marisha yeah what are we carrying him by  matt along the brow line there are /none/ these small holes that could be breathing holes youd have to  carry it from there under the socket or under the jaw  liam because thats what you want to stick your finger in  travis yeah totally the mucus hole  marisha i grab the jaw and i say hey jester  taliesin i did share meals with this person for two straight years never mind im walking away  travis we are fucking with his old coworker  taliesin im already walking away i took the kid and am walking to the boat  laura marisha and /none/ travis sorry  liam caleb just retched into the grass from watching that  laura all right lets carry him  taliesin youre the worst youre all the worst  laura fjord i gave you the bag of skin dont forget you have that  travis i have it  laura you have the bag of slimy skin  travis im going to salt it and hang it out to dry  liam if it will help tomorrow or today what time is it its the middle of the night isnt it  matt you approached just after dusk so /none/ between the slow moving in there the combat and the rest  afterward its probably close to 1000pm  liam i know exactly what time it is dont i yeah  travis you know exactly what time it is  liam its something ive always been able to why is everybody looking at me like vomiting sound  laura wheres frumpkin  liam fwoosh  laura oh good  matt at this point molly as youre ahead of the group and youre making your way through the  trees toya begins to stir in your grasp her eyes open a /none/ bit as youre holding her and she looks up  at you confused eyes lolling around in the sockets for a moment before they see you and  clarify molly  taliesin i know dear youve been through a bit theres been some bad business  matt what happened  taliesin sighs a friend turned on us but its going to be all right im going to get you home  all right  matt wait wheres kylre she starts trying to fight your grasp  taliesin ill explain it later  matt shes going to try and break free /none/ of your grasp are you going to attempt to hold onto her  taliesin oh yeah  liam how far away are they from the rest of us  matt while you guys have been doing all this hes gone on ahead hes probably a good 40 to 50  feet ahead go ahead and roll an athletics check  taliesin youre a monster  laura oh no  travis tell me you did it  taliesin no its not that bad  laura oh it looked like a one from this angle still pretty terrible  travis and marisha /none/ chanting level two  laura you were rolling bad on this the last game you need to stop rolling that one  matt yeah that dice needs to go away  taliesin ive got some new stuff coming in  laura all right  marisha its coming across the border its real good  taliesin coming in from the feywild  matt you can choose athletics or acrobatics  taliesin oh can i reroll  matt no  taliesin then thats nine  matt that still beats her she rolled a five all right wanted to doublecheck shes scrambling  /none/ and as you pull her back she tries to fight for a second and then goes limp in your grasp and goes  im scared  taliesin i know its going to be a bit rough but it was for the best im so sorry some people  just turn im so sorry  matt what happened  taliesin he got sick there was something inside him there was something that made him  do some bad things but it had to be taken care of youre going to be all right  matt she gets really quiet for a /none/ second you get to the boat and the gentleman earlier that you had  passed the wine off to is sitting there waiting he has a small pouch thats opened with some dried  meat that hes chewing on as hes waiting as you guys walk up he says oh i see youve finished  laura and marisha groaning  matt shouting what in the hell is that  marisha move  laura we told you we were having a party man  liam i was just about to suggest covering that up but you know all cards on the /none/ table  matt he grabs his bag of dried meat pulls it up and backs up i didnt know what is that what  did you do what is that  marisha i said we were going to be doing some frog digging  taliesin biggest frog youve ever seen  matt theres a pause before this tiny screeching sound begins to emit from toya this high pitched  and barely audible squeak as toya begins to scream  laura i take off my cloak and i cover the head with it  taliesin i was trying to keep her /none/ away from that  matt its hard to keep her away from that  travis we literally cut the head off barney and shoved it in her face singsong i love you  taliesin the barney that been raising her yes really take that in off to a great start  matt after jester throws her cloak over toya  laura no not toya over the head  taliesin im trying to keep her quiet  matt shes sobbing into your arms at this point you feel her body shaking against your grasp  laura i feel so bad  /none/ taliesin you should  sam poor girl  taliesin im going to take her to the front of the boat and keep her far away from all that  liam i pull fjord away for a moment about ten or 15 feet away this man in the boat has seen all of  you who are supposed to be under house arrest we cannot have him talking to the authorities  sam should we kill him  liam jeez come here  travis i have a good feeling that this guy is a man of upstanding nature im sure hell /none/ keep it  to himself  liam oh thats very trusting  travis yeah of course  sam we gave him one bottle of wine thats not very much  travis we have another bottle dont we  marisha yes  liam oh youre here too now great its a party  marisha we could also toss him a bit of gold if we think it would make him forget the night  travis after all we came to him right i would prefer not to use any violence  liam im not suggesting that but its either violence or /town/ giving him a little something  marisha what makes you think hes going to go talk to the authorities  liam you want to leave it to chance  marisha who cares  sam this is a small town beau everyone talks to everyone you taught us that  marisha i did but everyone also hated the circus  liam molly do you want to join this conversation  taliesin ive been listening i pull out a gold coin give him this  laura maybe one more or two more  marisha i pull two out as well  laura /none/ ill pull three out  matt hes recessed to the very back of his boat wideeyed as you approach  travis youre right coin is a good idea  laura go charm him fjord youre very charming  marisha youve got fisherman vibes  travis oh shit wait a minute how long did that fight take  matt youve returned to your normal halforc form  travis oh cool okay there was an old man who was with us before  taliesin and now theres a little girl its all coming full circle  travis maybe we give him the /town/ extra bottle of wine and you go talk to him  liam walking up to the boat  marisha here clink  liam collecting it as i go the thing of it is weve just done trostenwald what was that  never mind a great service there was an unsavory element did you know the circus was in town  doesnt matter there was a bad fellow thats his head with them its no fault of theirs you pick weird folk up on the  road in the circus isnt that right mollymauk  taliesin ill let that go  /town/ matt he reaches over grabs the oar from the side and lifts the cloak off the face  liam thats going to rile you up thats a bad idea  matt it doesnt look like a savory creature  laura it wasnt trust us  taliesin took a lot out of us  liam but the situation in town is a little political were going to take this thing out of  here and im going to report it to the authorities we dont really want to create a stir  and frighten people here i hope you will take /none/  laura we like to be unsung heroes you know like superheroes with secret identities  marisha yeah were an underground anonymous activist group  laura yeah that helps people but if everyone knows who we are itll be much harder to fight  all the crime  liam try to focus on the gold  matt he slowly reaches out and takes it from your hand all right i trust it was a bad thing so  im going to take you back and then you promise ill never see you again  laura well try really hard to /tavern/ not let you see us  taliesin if you see us we wont make eye contact  laura well pretend we dont know you  matt that includes the goblin  sam i was never here we never had this conversation  laura shes a halfling  matt he glances over and takes a closer look  sam im very ugly for a halfling  matt lets just get back to shore he grabs the oar takes the bottle of wine that he had mostly  drunk by himself before and polishes it off in one series of gulps  /tavern/ laura dont boat drunk  matt as you all gather up onto the ship he begins to paddle you back towards the western  shore of the ustaloch to the outskirts of trostenwald  marisha when we get to the shore we should probably split up  laura how are we going to get this giant head to the authorities  marisha thats a good question  laura oh i got an idea why dont you go get a wagon as soon as we get to shore and well help  you load it onto the wagon and then you /town/ just take it on in yourself  taliesin its a shame we didnt just get rid of a wagon not more than one night ago  sam why do we need to take it with us us traipsing through town with a giant head seems  like it would draw focus why dont we just put it somewhere and send the authorities out here to  find it later  taliesin someone else may get to it or something might happen  sam what are they going to do with it its a big head  marisha we could leave /none/ someone with it and we can just  travis i could stand guard as a crownsguard next to it  taliesin what could people do with the head of a creature like this  matt what could people do with the head of a creature like this who knows  taliesin would i know  laura they could make a lot of soup  matt they could turn it in for theres a lot of poor folk here if they had a large looking odd  creature thats worth some gold  sam we can hide it maybe some of /tavern/ us have skills to hide things  liam i think fjord had a good idea which is if you can disguise yourself as a crownsguard again  you wait with it you guys get back to the tavern yeah  marisha you can go and alert the authorities  liam now heres the thing i may be speaking out of turn i know i dont know you very well but  it feels like the thing that we all share in common here is that we dont wish to make maybe  not you make a big splash here  /none/ travis agreed the less attention the better  laura well you know whatever  travis the less attention the better  taliesin for the moment  liam okay so maybe im 70 to 80 percent correct but were all in this together  marisha and gold i like getting paid  taliesin we need to get this one back to the circus too you might be helpful for that  liam i dont want to make a big thing im going to go the authorities to my keen mind tells me  that womans name was  matt oh the /none/ sorry  liam yeah the one who wanted to go eat  matt yes youre talking about  travis norda  matt yes lawmaster norda  liam norda i want to go to her and citizens arrest kind of thing keep it quiet dont need  big accolades will take gold and then ill bring that back and we can divvy that up thats no problem  travis i like it as soon as other crownsguard arrive with norda and the rest of whoever you  bring to the scene maybe i can go with you and help return toya /town/  laura you disappear quickly because if you get drawn into that investigation it would be bad  liam right and if nobody recognizes you do you remember any of the guards that were in town that  you could make yourself look like specifically  laura oh  marisha what was that guys name  laura what were the two guards that keep coming to the tavern  marisha oh wait  laura we wrote their names down  marisha jonas and lucas  laura thats right  sam and marisha the jonas brothers  matt theyre not related /none/ at all  liam dm question the two zombified back at the circus tents were they burnt to a crisp beyond  recognition  matt one of them was and they have been discovered  liam yeah but was he recognizable did we leave him looking like that dude at the end of the last  crusade after he drank from the wrong cup  matt with some time he could be identified  liam okay well the jonas brothers it is friends  sam just to game this out you caleb someone who is not suspected of a crime /none/ is going to bring  the severed head of a member of the circus to the police  laura no hes going to go to the police and bring them to the head  sam either way you caleb someone who is not suspected of a crime is going to point the police  to the severed head of a member of the circus with no evidence showing what that thing was or that it  was evil and that will somehow not implicate other people who were not with us at the time how  is this going to /none/ prove their innocence just showing a head  liam they already believe that the circus is terrible i think they were just going to confirm  their own suspicions  marisha also toya if she would speak honestly she would absolve all of us  travis i think beau makes a very good point without toyas testimony were in trouble  taliesin im hoping toya will  liam well thats a sticky situation because what if she talks about my friends who were there  with me  taliesin she knows what to say when guards are asking questions  /none/ liam it looks like she knows how to go off like a siren  taliesin shes had a bad night  liam im at one hit point i understand  taliesin well have a talk well get her to some people who can calm her down and make sure she  remembers how we take care of each other  matt if theres something you want to ask me im right here youre all in this boat as it  makes its way across the ustaloch  taliesin sorry dear i was hoping that we didnt have to have this /none/ conversation in front of strangers  matt can someone please explain to me whats going on  liam can you explain to us maybe your relationship with kylre if that was his name  matt i mean thats the name ive ever known  liam lets talk about the killing part though  matt i dont know anything about that when we did the show the other night the horrible man  taliesin it turns out that that was kylre did that  matt why  taliesin i dont know why something snapped hes hurt and killed a lot of /none/ people we think  that maybe hes been making you sick too  laura have you ever heard him say nergaliid  matt no wheres gustav  taliesin gustav is having trouble with the authorities were going to need to all work  together to save him  travis unfortunately the authorities think that gustav and the circus are responsible for what  happened actually its just kylre he wasnt what you thought he was im afraid  taliesin the twins are being the twins ornnas being ornna but i think we can save everybody we  just need to /none/ take care of each other  matt he was my friend though  liam child how did you grow so close to him  matt gustav put us together for our act and he protected me i felt safe around him he didnt  let anybody get too close i didnt want to  liam did he communicate with you in some way  matt he talked  liam what did you talk about  matt well we talked about everybody else in the family we talked about how i missed not having a  family he didnt talk about /none/ himself much but it was mainly just little games  laura did he teach you how to sing to affect peoples minds  matt no that was how i got by before i met these guys  liam i am sure this is painful for you you are young sometimes people we feel we know can be  someone else regrettably this is one of those instances he was a dangerous thing it is very  important that this is buried here you want to travel on with the circus and with mollymauk and  your friends that thing tried /none/ to kill us it did kill things in trostenwald who knows what it  would have done to you child  matt make a persuasion check  liam oof  sam its good  liam no its not good  taliesin i felt it  travis its sam good  liam it is only a six rolled very low  matt as youre talking to her her eyes keep flickering off of your face and over towards beau  you watch her curl back into herself and get quiet  travis it might do for you to apologize  marisha /none/ sorry  laura sorry for what beau  marisha really jester  laura really  taliesin no i want to hear this too  marisha sorry for choking you with my stick  taliesin somehow that was better than what i was hoping for  liam rated t for teen  sam and ill never do it again  laughter  marisha and ill never do it again as long as you dont try that again of course i guess  laura it was only because kylre was trying to kill us and she was afraid that you were helping /none/ him  marisha yeah i wasnt trying to hurt you i was just trying to get you to stop singing but it was  so abrasive  taliesin you know how people outside can be the mean girl was just afraid of you and were going  to let her go on this one  matt im tired  taliesin yeah i know lets get you home okay  matt she leans into you molly after a few minutes she falls asleep against you  laura that went well i think  taliesin choked you with my stick  marisha /none/ i did  laura she apologized for exactly what she did  taliesin that was certainly memorable  matt all right were here the boat hits the edge of the dock he hops off and pulls the rope  up slowly manages the boat over to the side of the dock ties it up  laura how many people are around the dock right now  matt theres no boats at the dock that are being manned currently there are a few boats out on the  water that you saw in the distance there are some night fishermen theres /none/ nobody immediately in the  vicinity  travis okay im going to hop off the boat and break eye contact with the captain of the boat so  that i can disguise self into a crownsguard  liam i talk to him while you do that you have your wine you have your gold thank you very  much it is much appreciated it was a lovely trip  matt yes thats fine just please get out of my boat  travis english accent who goes there what is this what have you brought  liam oh i have felled /none/ a beast  matt they got in my boat i they  travis are you responsible for this  matt no they took over my boat and forced me to take them to the middle island there  liam you will not take credit for my kill i have killed this thing and i want it to be watched i  am going to the authorities we will bring them back and get this sorted  travis its a horrifyinglooking creature you are to be commended for your bravery lawmaster  norda will want to know about this immediately  /none/ laura you werent here  matt make a deception check with advantage  taliesin this is so weird  laura im just holding a bowling ball  travis 21 no 20  matt he goes i want nothing to do with this good night he helps each of you quickly get off  the boat ties and locks it up and makes a beeline  sam shouting well come to your house with your share of the reward  laughter  travis all right we cant waste any time  laura can i lob the head up over the side /none/ of the boat  matt make a strength check  liam monster calves  laura oh no  sam youre strong though  taliesin are you  liam yeah but at level two you need to roll higher than a three  laura eight  matt you get it partway up and it begins sliding back into the boat and plops into the boat and  goes bouncing and you have to catch yourself  travis tongue and mouth just lolling  matt its terrifying  laura all right i need help its still covered dont worry she cant see /none/ what were doing its  covered with my cloak  sam ill help you  laura by the way its a little tiny cloak its like a half cape so its like  taliesin its like a napkin on a buffalo  matt a doily on a couch  sam ill help you  laura its going to squish you  sam thats all right im strong one two three  matt eventually you guys get it up onto the dock  laura oh thats good  travis molly do you intend to keep toya here or do you need /town/ to take her back  taliesin take her right back no one can know that shes been anywhere  liam that is correct take her and sequester her with the family so not a peep gets out  taliesin well explain to her what needs to be done  marisha how do we trust you all wont skip town in the middle of the night  taliesin we still have people in the lockup  laura gustavs in jail still  marisha so  laura some people are loyal  taliesin ill be back and i have to show back /none/ up with you people anyway im

getting used to  laura i /none/ dont think she makes any noise  marisha can she tap  laura but if she can cast through her then i can imagine she can make contact because she casts on touch  matt you create an illusory duplicate of yourself it is an illusion it cannot make  actually physical contact with anything  laura well if shes behind one of the guards then two of the other guards can see her  matt sure  sam we took a short rest on the thing  matt ill say on the boat across the river sure  sam /none/ if you want to hit dice it up  travis you can roll one hit die hes rolling commando he

building  matt okay  sam we have to kill these fucking guards dont we  marisha no  matt the guard sees something quickly dart into the shadows and continues walking towards you  laura oh come on  /tavern/ marisha just go with it go with it  laura did you see that behind you  matt the guard approaches and goes it seems that you have been out and about when you were  supposed to be within the inn  marisha found it the ring  laura thats my ring i dropped it out the window  sam she calls it a shoe its a shoe ring  laura i like to wear them on my toes  matt three more guards have now approached from the front of the building and they approach and  begin /none/ pulling out manacles and chains and say were going to have to take you to the stockade  laura oh please dont really we

make a stealth check with  advantage  taliesin 13  matt you guys slowly make your way through the low grass over towards where the outside of the  carnival is as you approach you can see theres about five crownsguard that are making rounds  around the outside it looks like where previously they had been keeping watch over the people that /none/  were there since the murder of two of their own it has heightened the intensity of the watch it  looks like its fairly well watched you get the sense at a distance that you would have a hard  time getting in there you can try and sneak her in and sneak out but it seems dangerous  taliesin oh shite not even a good push to get her underneath just back into one of the tents  or no  matt you can try  taliesin yeah i dont know theyre caught do i  matt no /town/ you have no idea  marisha lets all get caught  taliesin im going to try and wait for an advantageous moment  matt which im going to allow you to do you stay outside of the outskirts of the torchlight at the  very front of the tent and the back of the tent the fire of the actual encampment has gone out  because you dont see any other carnival members the sisters ran they fled you dont see any sign  of desmond or ornna make one more stealth check for the two of you with advantage /none/ because you still  have the ability youre at the cusp end of it though  taliesin ooh 22  matt you manage to pace yourself just carefully wait for the right moment dart out of the grass  having her under your arm and shes like what why what is going on  taliesin you remember nothing happened find ornna you didnt see me you just hid and waited  and you didnt know that anything was wrong if people ask unless you hear from me you dont  know anything  matt okay you slip her into the /town/ tent and back out none the wiser  taliesin im going to start heading back to the inn  matt okay you go back to the inn you two youre just waiting  liam no im not waiting im going to see norda so ill see you shortly be ready  travis you will  matt okay you make your way to the stockade as you approach and make your way into the interior  the two crownsguard at the front say hold whats your business  liam excuse me and i lurch and prop myself up against a wall /town/ and push back excuse me i just  had a very harrowing night  matt have you been drinking  liam you get me norda this very minute and i will tell you what has happened with this circus and in  this town and dont keep me waiting another minute im bleeding out here arschloch  matt make an intimidation check  taliesin nice  liam oh come on  matt just keep it in the  liam i wish i had gone with that because it was great there but its not great here that is a nine /tavern/  matt it is indeed he sits there and glares down at you for a second your posturing this  filthy scruffy man in a coat that wandered up out of nowhere covered in a little bit of his own  blood he just looks down at you for a second sorry shes done for the night  sam they keep regular hours here  liam excuse me there are very good people being held under house arrest in a tavern right now  they are innocent i have evidence that i can show her this whole thing can be /none/ solved now  matt this whole thing can be solved first thing in the morning ill let you sleep it off have  some water come back when youre feeling a little more yourself  sam kill them all  travis i draw back and flames burst forth  liam okay i look him in the eye i will go away get the message to her that the head of the circus  frog is at the docks waiting for her inspection  matt at this point you hear a voice on the inside just like good night good night /tavern/ and a  cloaked figure exits the front doorway roughly about four and a half foot tall  liam i remember the height  matt norda is off the clock and is currently leaving for the evening to return to her home  liam shouting there is a circus toads remains at the docks i would like to put this towns  fears to rest i am looking for whats her name yorda  all norda  liam norda yordas at the inn right  matt theres norda and then yorda because i like to make it as confusing as /none/ possible  liam liams memory is really spotty but calebs is rocksolid  matt its funny when you spell things on paper they seem so much different and when you say them  out loud theyre like ah theyre very similar the figure stops and turns and you hear this  audible heavy sigh the figure waddles over towards you and pulls the hood back and its  norda all right whats this about a frog head  liam thank goodness thank you gentlemen forgive me i can see that youre trying to get  yourself home to bed  /none/ matt that would be preferable aye you see bags under her eyes shes had a long day her  hairs a bit frazzled and she looks like shes waiting for you to finish  liam you are very aware that there are people at the nestled nook under house arrest by your order  they are innocent and i can prove it and i would like to end things as quickly as possible i have  killed one of the circus folk this evening  matt now thisll be real interesting she looks past you and you follow her eyeline /none/ and there  you hear the sound of chains as a handful of crownsguard with jester beau and nott in  manacles approach from behind these ones youre talking about right  marisha help help help  laughter  liam funny story yes these are the people i was talking about nothing has changed however and i  am only asking to take another ten minutes of your time to walk to the dock one of the performers  has been killed this evening and i have done it i staked out the circus because my friends were in  /none/ trouble and wrongly accused and i knew this so i staked out the circus this evening and watched  as this toad thing left the grounds there it did this to me and i in a rage followed it and  destroyed it and i will show you the remains of my work well put it to bed im either a clown  or im a toadkiller lets see what it is  matt make a persuasion check  liam come on you fucker  laura oh goddamn  liam 11  matt she goes sighs hold onto them for /none/ just a moment she walks back inside a moment passes  and she returns with four other guards  laura i keep doing this so i can make a jingling sound with my chains  liam you know thats probably agitating the issue lets go to the docks  matt she comes up all right drag them along with us show us what this thing is and if what  you say is not true youll join them hows that sound  liam im good with these terms follow me please  matt all right  laura you know the /tavern/ only reason we were out of the inn is because we were looking for you caleb  we didnt know where you went  liam i am not going to answer her im just walking very firmly with purpose to the docks  matt it has been close to an hour at this point  travis if i can clock that i would like to leave the head move off into the shadows and assume my  older man form  matt using your second slot  travis no i can just drop  matt oh no you can do /none/ this whenever thats right  travis ill drop the crownsguard and make the old man and sit so i can keep an eye on it but  away from it  matt eventually you guys are led up to the docks where you guide them  liam moment of confusion here it is right here where i left it nobody has tampered with  it i turn around and i pull back my clothing and show a huge slash across my body and say you see  this it was done by this thing whoosh  matt as soon as /none/ you pull back and reveal the face its jaw is relaxed now its muscles have sat  now that its been left in the dock and its pooled at its base this old pumpkin look its  tongues lolling out and unraveled on the ground what remained within its salivary glands has  soaked the remaining wood around its base one of the eyes has rolled back but its a horrible  display the guards take a step back immediately at the reveal and norda immediately gets  interested gets close takes a look at it and begins prodding a /none/ bit with her finger  liam it is as bad as it looks and if you have any holy people in this city they will confirm  that this thing is fiendish  matt sighs you say its a fiend because what this looks like is you just murdered one of our  possible witnesses andor other members of this investigation so im hoping this is a fiend i  dont know fiends  liam i hope you dont believe that i slashed open my own body and then went to the police  matt honey ive been doing this /town/ for a long time ive seen stranger hold on just a second  she calls one of the guards over whispers to him for a second he rushes off just so happens we have  someone in town who might be able to confirm this for us might help your case  laura who is it  matt oh they will be here shortly  liam i sit down on a crate and i stop talking  matt okay and this awkward period of time with the guards all just standing there holding you  as you wait patiently some /town/ of them are tapping their fingers you start rattling your chains and  two guards pull the chains taut so you cant do it anymore mollymauk as you begin to make your way  back into town because youre making your way through the dock district along the lakeside and  you look up ahead and you can see theres a couple of torches being held by crownsguard right  where the head was left and you can see caleb and then three of your allies in chains  taliesin hmm sighs  laura oh no what are you going /none/ to do  taliesin im going to get a little closer  matt all right make a stealth check please you do not have advantage anymore that has passed  its been more than a hour  taliesin just to take a look at what is actually going on  laura not to get too close  taliesin not too close  matt yeah its not a high dc  taliesin 19  matt you get a little closer you are still maybe a good 100 feet or so away from them keeping to  the shadows along a building /none/ keeping low thankfully its nighttime its pushing midnight  at this point because youre ostentatiously dressed but there isnt a lot of light in your  colors as far as you know right now no one can see you youre too far away to hear much but you  can keep an eye on them  taliesin oh whats the play whats the play  ah im going to yeah fuck it im going to walk up  matt all right  taliesin with briskly there i find you ive been looking everywhere  youre not supposed to leave  /tavern/ the bloody inn you oh  sighs theyre already in trouble apparently  matt i love when they do this chain him up you are shackled as well  taliesin all right less questions to answer  matt at this point norda is starting to smile a bit shes like man if we could have more  criminals like you lot my job would be far easier i would get home a lot earlier  sam were not criminals were not me and caleb were just travelling ever since we broke out of that  nothing  taliesin dance number /none/  liam no its good that you try so hard to protect the rights of giant frog creatures im  very impressed  laura fiend creatures specifically  matt at this point the guard that had left earlier who has been gone for about 15 to 20  minutes or so comes back with a brisk jog theres another figure walking up behind him also  jogging you can see light gray hood and cloak around and as the figure approaches into the torch  light pulls back the hood and you see this long shoulder length curled blond hair /town/ a very very  delicate looking elven male who approaches i believe ive been summoned norda yes sorry  this is archivist zeenoth hes been in town for a few days and he comes from the library that knows  a lot about a lot of things i hope that he can help us in this zeenoth theyre calling this  thing a fiend what do you know about this he steps closer kneels down next to the head  taliesin xhorhas  matt hmm  taliesin i just whisper xhorhas  matt yes these creatures do frequent xhorhas he /none/ gives some look over pulls a small book out of  his side pouch begins to thumb through it compares a few things im not a specialist  unfortunately this creature is very much a very dangerous entity from the far east im surprised  it made it this far into civilization before being destroyed its a good thing it has been he now  gets to look at everyone over the crew and goes are you the ones who slew it  laura oh well technically it was caleb technically  liam just me  matt as the figure /town/ looks over and stops on beau and kind of smiles  sam whats going on over there  marisha oh sorry i just have back issues im just stretching  liam yes it was difficult but i prevailed in the end the city is safe what library was that that  you mentioned  matt oh im an archivist im the archivist of the cobalt soul  liam here in town  matt no im from zadash im a bit out of my depth at the moment  laura what brings you this far  matt well i have business /none/ at this point norda goes all right you know what this is some  serious bullshite were all just chilling here at the docks we have confirmed thats a fiend  laura the nergaliid  matt a nergaliid bring them back to the stockade lets have a trial they begin to pull  you guys back to the stockade two of the guards grab the nergaliid head and they begin dragging it  along and you guys are all being pulled  liam oh sorry one last thing watchmaster i pull out the book that i read about the nergaliid /none/  here this is a gift for you this is folklore you will find i have marked a page in there it  will describe this thing  matt as you guys are walking she thumbs through and finds the page begins to read passes it to  the archivist he begins to read it he passes it back you guys all make your way into the  stockade youre not brought to her chambers youre brought to a much larger room this room  has much more of a stark barren stone interior there are benches built there is /tavern/ a central kind  of a pit theres about four or five steps down into this pit then above that is a desk where  norda takes as the law master as you step in you realize oh this is a room of judgement what are  you doing  travis i would like to try once they start making their way back to that facility to quickly  make my way to the inn if i can as the old man enter make my way into the restroom drop my  disguise come back out as fjord oh the /none/ water closet what have you  matt there is a shared water closet  liam its just a pot  travis yeah the room with the pot in it then make my way back to the front door stick my head  out where the guards are  matt yeah theres two guards still posted there most of them have already left because theyre  carting off the rest of your friends  travis please i cant seem to find any of my comrades have you seen where they have gone  matt they look at each other yeah theyve /none/ been arrested  travis i was afraid as much could i make my way down to where they are being held i would like to  be present if it would be prudent  matt you leave our watch we cut you they both flank you side to side and push you ahead a little  bit they are glued to your right and left  travis very kind of you  matt they lead you to the stockade as you guys are brought into this chamber norda sets up  sam who is going to go get the little /none/ girl  liam youre the little girl here youre confused its been a night  matt norda up there at the top takes her cloak off puts on her ceremonial armor bits theres a  whole element to the presentation of this you can see her tiredly putting them on sets her hands on  the top i would like you to present what evidence you have to absolve you of these charges  against you and then based on what you present ill decide whether or not youre innocent or  guilty or require further investigation who would like /none/ to present evidence first you you brought  the head of a creature youre not in chains well start with you they drag the creatures  head forward she takes the book from the archivist and speaking with zeenoth here it  appears what you said is true this creature is a dangerous terrible fiend and looking at its  apparent ability to feast on the essence of creatures this explains both the transformation  of the old man this also explains destruction of our two guards who were recently discovered rest  their soul so that explains that convince /dung/ me as to why you were not working with this entity  especially those of the carnival she snaps her finger again and you watch as gustav and bosun are  brought into the chamber as well as a third figure who you see step out of the shadows her  hair dark and fading to white last seen fleeing into the distant fields you see in chains as  well yasha being pulled into the courtroom  cheering  travis showing up just to get arrested  marisha welcome to the club  liam singing breaking the law breaking /none/ the law  taliesin lot of help you were  marisha welcome to the chain gang  ashley hey yeah  matt that one was caught fleeing from the scene  ashley no thats completely a misunderstanding of things thats not what happened  matt im certain you have a trustworthy face whats the next bit of evidence you want to  present please anyone  liam well first a question are you familiar with occams razor  matt what  liam i figured okay that one works for the circus do i look like i work for the circus /none/  matt

reveal your hand fjord enters  through the door like it /none/ was a planned arrival  sam weirdly hes dripping wet  travis baby oil  liam the sardonic one right with the shiteating grin does she look like she works for  the circus  matt i dont know what she works for but i dont trust her  marisha thats smart  liam i am injured within a centimeter of my life this one is a nincompoop  laura wait which one were you pointing at  liam thats you i pull the mask away this is my good friend shes a goblin  sam a little halfling girl /none/  matt at this point you watch her pull back  liam i step in front of her she is my friend and colleague and you will not lay a hand on her while  i am standing here  matt make a persuasion check  liam fucking right i will  that is an 11 chanting level two  marisha chanting shitty dice  matt her eyes are chained onto this goblin  liam shes looking into my chest because nott is behind me im sorry im confused why youre  going to such lengths to defend the rights /none/ of this large oversized frog skull  matt i defend no rights of this creature ive been in this office long enough to know that there  arent usually solo workers on something like this i know these folk they all protect each  other whos to say this wasnt their whole reasoning for coming anyway and something went  wrong and theyre letting him take the fall  liam theres a big conspiracy to make undead crownsguard here in the city  matt i dont fucking know dont tell me how i do my business sit the fuck down /none/ whos next  taliesin youre right we do protect our own thats absolutely true  matt let him up they loosen the chains and you get to stand and approach a bit  taliesin its a common tactic its a good way to make your way through this world normally it  works we assumed the circus anyway that we were being framed we were protecting our own is  the head in here  laura yes  taliesin this one showed his true colors and then we took care of it im going to throw one of  my /none/ swords down on the ground that is filthy with its blood  matt all right why did this one run  ashley well  sam highpitched i mean  ashley i feel like i didnt need to be in there anymore you know i dont ugh  matt i would like you both to make persuasion checks  ashley i feel like  taliesin oh shit 12  ashley 11  taliesin we needed someone on the outside we knew we were innocent we knew you didnt think  so we just assumed you were going to have us all /none/ executed and we didnt do anything what would you  have done  matt is that goblin pissing in my court  laughter  sam im sorry im really nervous  taliesin in his defense its a wonderful vintage her defense  sam im very nervous im sorry its just your guards shackled both my wrists and my ankles and i  cant move to get into a good position  liam you know when shes nervous she aerates her bladder all right  sam look i have some evidence to submit look at my hands and also the hands /none/ of jester were  covered in the things

kin convince me why i shouldnt hang you tomorrow  sam im sorry for your loss where are your people from  matt grimgolir  sam thats not where my clans from i had nothing to do with it my clan operates

sam you can feel free ill even tell you where they are im no longer associated with them and i  can help you hunt them down if youd like  matt make a persuasion check  marisha wow  laura what is it  sam one  laura no but you didnt roll a one he rolled a four  sam its not a natural /none/ one  laura and taliesin not a natural one  liam still sucks  matt sigh  laura god why are we rolling so bad  matt she leans back i want to sleep i think youre telling the truth most of you archivist  does this resonate with you as well does this check out lorewise i dont know what the fuck  you do the archivist is like i believe based on what theyve stated at least its consistent  though im a bit confused as to the demeanor of the goblin its not unheard of to have /none/ goblin kin  turn against their own there have been a number of historic individuals of various monstrous races  who have been beneficial members of society  liam i invite nott up to my piggyback position on my shoulders  laura you cant shes chained up  liam i scoop her up  sam this is even more awkward just put me back down put me back down  liam just let it happen  sam no the chains are pulling me one way and youre pulling me the other way just come down to  my level come /none/ down here  matt bring the two others forward they bring forward gustav and bosun this is your circus  right he goes it is my circus and i take full responsibility for whats happened sincerely  they have done nothing wrong they are completely innocent i brought this creature into our fold  and that is on me whatever judgement you have bring onto my head not theirs please i implore  you fine ill consider the investigation closed youre all freed of charges against you  including the goblin  sam oh thank you i would kiss you /none/ if i could  matt i would not recommend trying okay gustav whats i cant read your last name youve been  given quite a debt for trostenwald so you shall remain here until youve worked off the debt to  the city to the number of 2645 gold pieces to make up for the deaths of our two crownsguard of  the two civilians who have died and the general cost of this entire investigation well consider  what your work is to the city tomorrow however the rest of you youre free to go im going to  /none/ go get myself some sleep  liam can i have my book back please  matt takes her armor off sigh all right im going to get a drink she puts her cloak on and  then hops off with the imposing sight of her on top of a large pedestal and desk she hops down to  her natural dwarven height and its almost adorable to watch her just skitter the hell out of  there shes done  laura where are you getting a drink at  matt theres no response  laura do you want company  /dung/ travis i just turn to the nearest crownsguard and  matt the chains are removed they free everybody including gustav but two guards are assigned to  him to keep an eye over him  marisha as soon as beau gets out of her chains i grab my stuff and i leave  matt okay as you are exiting the stockade in the archway of the doors right outside you see  another figure standing hood up like a short hood with a mantle that stops about midway bare  arms and dark skin baggy gray pants and is there /none/ waiting  marisha whats the mantle  matt you dont recognize any details about it you see a cloaked figure there waiting looking  right at you  marisha is he blocking the doorway  matt is just beyond the doorway its not blocked  marisha is there another way out  matt i mean you can exit theyre just on the other side of the door every other way in you  dont know the stockade well and all of it just leads further into the stockade there are other  crownsguard inside  marisha okay im just going /none/ to try and just bolt through  matt youre just going to bolt full run  marisha not run just you know irish goodbye  matt okay all right as you briskly exit and turn to the left the figure intervenes and side  steps right in front of you  marisha do i recognize him  matt no you dont see much of the face the hood is up and a little bit of the moonlight is coming  you can see the edge of features the body is muscular but thin looks not terribly masculine  or feminine /town/ but it looks able and it moved at a very quick speed to intercept your positioning  marisha i just go oh fuck turn around and walk back in  matt okay  marisha ill join everyone else i flick off the guy on my way back in  matt okay as you guys are being escorted out of the stockade beau comes back in and joins you  laura i thought you left  marisha

guys too  sam where did you go were you on the lam for a long time  ashley i have a little bit of a problem with authority and i didnt want to be caught in a  small and confined space and then that ended up happening  laura how long have you been in there  ashley immediately after i ran away they sent out horses im not that fast but i did fuck up a  /none/ few of the guards by accident   matt as you say that you hear a couple clears throat and two of the crownsguard visibly bruised  that are escorting you guys out into the night air before they eventually leave you to your own devices  travis molly what do you think this means for the carnival  taliesin i dont know that is a question  laura i mean if gustav has to stay here then whos going to run it  marisha thats a lot of gold thats like a life sentence worth of gold  laura /none/ well i mean  taliesin gold comes gold goes  liam how much do you think the circus has  taliesin i dont know how much the circus has and honestly i think ornna would lie about it if we asked  matt the crownsguard have pulled away and now its just you guys and bosun and gustav now out  in the air and gustav is rubbing his wrists well thank you everyone for helping that could  have been a lot worse and you know its fine i know its a lot of money but shouldnt take me /town/  more than a few years its a nice town trostenwald is a nice town  travis its not that nice  matt no its not but you know its better than prison  laura theres a lot of beer here  matt that there is i may have to start a small fund for that on its own  liam what happens to the circus because you know you cant do the same show for the same people for  a year  matt wheres ornna wheres the twins wheres  taliesin well the twins buggered ornna god only /none/ knows  ashley wheres toya  taliesin toya is back at the circus but shaken very shaken  matt at which point gustav just begins making a beeline for the circus bosun goes oh sighs  taliesin how hard can it be to make 2000 gold  matt i dont know how much he saved nowhere near that much probably  taliesin how hard can it be to steal 2000 gold  laura i dont know how many people around here have that much although the breweries might  taliesin maybe be best to find that gold elsewhere  ashley /none/ wait so who killed him  matt gustav has spun around and comes back and is like sincerely i appreciate the aid but dont  this is on me ill take care of it this is not your responsibility its not your responsibility  you guys have already done so much its fine ill take care of it  taliesin suppose we should take a look at whats left of the circus  marisha can i go take a look around do i see zeenoth anywhere  matt make a perception check  marisha oh god damn it it was /none/ almost better it was almost good ten

rest of the  family around her that still remain at least desmonds come and joined as well as youre all  sitting together for a bit theres a moment of quiet as youre all sipping and just tiredly  thinking over the events /none/ of the evening toya breaks the silence is the family going away am  i going to be alone again ornna looks over at her and goes not if i can help it its you and  me kid against the world bosun pats ornna on the shoulder and says well if youd have me  you can probably use a strong arm ornna looks back at him ornna and him have had this  rivalry tension for a while she

caused you little one  travis we had quite the adventure actually i know people were hurt but that was really  something  marisha and apparently nobody really cared about enon so thats you know good

mainly caleb we had to get out i mean it was a bad place  laura were they going to kill you  sam we would have died for /none/ sure  ashley but you guys were there together because you knew each other before  liam well first of all shes being modest it was not just me at all i could not have gotten  out of there without you i dont think you could have gotten out of there without me either but you

warehouse  doors where you had previously worked when you first arrived at trostenwald and archivist  zeenoth gestures for you to enter please if you dont mind my dear  marisha really is this what got me caught working for these fucking assholes ugh i walk in  matt there is a single glowing lantern that is currently hanging from a rope that is strewn  across /none/ the ceiling of the warehouse that gives a central source of light to the room it causes the  shadows to stretch out very long across the sides  marisha what is this  matt as you walk in and turn around the door is closed the two figures approach the female elf  goes and takes a chair and sets it in the center beneath the lantern please have a seat  marisha id prefer to stand  matt she just sits back about 20 or so feet and leans against one of the large stacks of crates as /none/  zeenoth approaches you now beauregard you have been what the archive would call a problematic  student  marisha laughter  matt ive had to pull in quite a bit of a favor  marisha sorry laughter keep going im listening  matt since i have been assigned to your tutelage overseeing your progress and training  youve shown great promise in many ways youre a seeker of truth and you have a keen sense for  manipulations and falsehoods correct  marisha thanks  matt when the archive took you in at the behest of your family you /none/ agreed to undergo our  discipline our lifestyle  marisha no i didnt agree to shit you took me in because im assuming my father paid you a  pretty nice sum of coin to make sure that you took me in im assuming that coin is no longer coming  to the reserve so why do you care  matt believe it or not not everyone does what they do in this world for coin we see possibility  in you we wish to prevent you from blowing out your own flame your tendencies clash with our  teachings /none/ your dislike for authority  marisha yeah i thought you guys hated me thought i was doing you a favor by leaving  matt at which point the woman from behind says your dislike for authority is not a bad thing it  can keep you alive authority should always be questioned those with more power than you should  be held to a higher standard  marisha thank you authoritative figure who i am unaware of your name  matt at which point zeenoth picks up again says but the way of the knowing mistress has an  order /none/ of learning your patience is essential to adhering to this path i know it may not be  stimulating at times but we must prepare your mind if we are ever to prepare your soul  marisha yeah id say that sorting books and punching brick walls repeatedly can definitely not  be stimulating at all times  matt look i just wish to at which point the elven woman goes enough ive heard enough  zeenoth you are removed of your responsibility to oversee beauregard zeenoths eyes go wide this  is not a student you can help return /none/ to zadash zeenoth goes expositor i do not think that i  have been given a fair shot please i know this girl because i see much of myself in her  you cannot reach her go zeenoth looks hurt i apologize that i failed you he turns around and  heads back towards the warehouse doors which shift open and close  marisha the fuck was that  matt the woman now steps forward  marisha i feel like he made me look like an asshole feel like an asshole fuck maybe im an  asshole  matt maybe /none/ youre an asshole you probably are an asshole thats all right because so am i  because sometimes you need someone to be an asshole to get shit done  marisha being nice never did what are we talking stranger  matt i am expositor dairon of the cobalt soul  marisha dairon  matt dairon i take it you have heard of our station through whispers  marisha some people like to call you boogie men i figured it was always real in my opinion the  best way to hide in a secret organization is by having a /none/ boogie man  matt we are the hidden strength of the library you are not wrong we wade in the filth of  society we weed out the corrupt we pursue the secret evils of the world and expose them to the  light  marisha wow  matt we twist the arm of the unjust until they spill their mysteries we are the spies we are  the hunters we are the watchmen to those who rule we are not kind we are forthright we are  truth do you beauregard want to see the truths of the world /none/  marisha oh god im sorry i have this burn in my butt from all the smoke you just blew up my ass  its just oh god is that a magical talent  matt whats your armor class  marisha 17  matt you suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage as out of nowhere her fist hits you right across  the side of your face  marisha it takes me to the ground that takes me to the ground  matt youre unconscious  marisha no

go for it roll for an attack  marisha just a straight unarmed right  matt yep  marisha 12 total not /none/ good  matt she dodges out of the way and as you move past plucks you in the back of the head with a  knuckle that hits you take one point of bludgeoning damage its a very light tap  marisha ow what the fuck my dad used to do that type of shit  matt with that she rushes around with a rapid pace to the front of you feints with an upper  cut and then goes to elbow you in the side of the head that is a 16 whats your armor class  marisha that /none/ misses 17  matt misses you manage to duck out of the way of it she goes good good  marisha i got to add some points here  matt okay shes going to go ahead and use her bonus action to go into a defensive stance  come on  marisha yells im going to spend a ki point and go into flurry of blows and do a blind  haymaker a second blind haymaker and then try and backhand with the third wildly recklessly  okay first one natural 20  matt oh shit  marisha second one /none/ natural 20  matt two natural 20s in a row  marisha i dont have anyone sitting next to me to confirm this but i swear its a natural 20  matt no i can see it  marisha ill take a picture if i have to a natural 17  matt roll damage on those first two  marisha okay you double the dice right  matt yeah roll the dice double it  marisha okay that was a three a two so five ten plus eight 18  matt 18 points of damage then the third strike that /none/ hit  marisha one so another five points god fucking thinking of my dad after she just went  boop something just popping the back of my head  matt you watch as her defensive stance shes prepared for it and as you go to swing she lets  it down at the last second and lets you get some hits in wham wham but much stronger than she  expected the first one clocks her across the chin the other one hits her across the temple  the last one  marisha just a wild backhand  matt just /none/ hits her in the back of the head she stumbles for a second then spins around you can  see a bit of blood trickling out of the corner of her mouth and theres a little bit of a scrape of  dirt on the side her head where you hit she turns around very good you have learned some things  in your time she quickly advances on you hits 18 hits okay you take three points of  bludgeoning damage one per hit pop pop pop she is basically going full in with the strike and is  /none/ just prodding you with these gentle little hits showing control showing that shes entirely able  to overwhelm you and shes hitting different places on your body strategically because with  each hit you feel this burst of numbness in those vicinities i need you to make a constitution  saving throw  marisha not great thats a natural seven so ten total  matt okay after each hit you gather yourself for a second she stops and goes you are quick  and there is intelligence lying in there you are also quite nimble at dodging blows do you /none/ see  with but a few simple strikes im able to extract from you everything i need to know about you  marisha what the fuck why cant i feel my hand what did you do  matt you see brute force has its place but precision and intent that can take down the  greatest of mountains by poking the weakest point now i know where your weak points are  marisha you dont know shit about me bitch im going to take another attack  matt go for it  marisha thats a three thats a nine  /none/ matt nope with each miss or the first miss shes going to use a reaction to attack you  thats going to be she can do that ducks out of the way and immediately uses a reaction to smack  you in the head for one point of damage another bludgeoning point shes going to spend another ki  point to do another reaction she can also do that  marisha roll i rolled a 15 to attack second attack these are two attacks right  matt for your second one yeah  marisha 15 so 21  matt yeah /none/ the second one does hit she does not get the second attack roll damage on that second  strike  marisha okay attacking her with the first one and then im just going to duck down a little and  jab her right in the ribs  matt all right what was the damage on that  marisha eight  matt eight damage nice you crack her in the ribs and the impact actually does catch her off  guard she ends up tumbling five feet backward across the ground catching herself in a  threepoint landing  marisha i /none/ back up im going to spend another ki point to do my defensive stance patient defense  matt okay patient defense you go into that stance that she was in earlier but holding it for  the entirety of this her eyes narrow for a second you see her looking at all the different  points that she struck on you earlier like shes reading some sort of a docket on what your  physicality is with that she doesnt run at you she runs around you in a circle and begins to jump  off the sides of the /none/ boxes some of the crates that are stacked up nearby you watch them wiggle  as she puts her weight up against them leaps off  marisha instead of getting distracted by her i just listen to her and look at her out of my  periphery  matt okay eventually she uses her momentum to climb to the top with her feet and leap off then  come downward with the knee towards you  marisha right as she comes down and im going to use oh wait dodge go first  matt youre already in your defensive stance /none/ so her attacks at disadvantage against you the  first strike 19 20 to hit  marisha miss it says patient defense spend one ki point to take the dodge action as a bonus  action on my turn  matt correct what the dodge action does is it means any attacks against you have disadvantage  marisha oh cool  matt the first one did hit second one does not the third one does two hits still get you both  one point of bludgeoning damage the knee comes down and right as it cracks into your head she /none/  shifts to the side and glides off and as soon as her body glides off her back is to yours and her  spinning elbow goes and cracks you in the side of the head but it stops short just barely hitting  you shes toying with you at this point  marisha you said two more points  matt yes two more points of bludgeoning damage make another constitution saving throw please  marisha 11 no sorry 12  matt this time opposed to the pressure points being hit there is the one smack on the side of /none/  your head  marisha yeah  matt this pain surges through the side of your temple and travels through your spine to all the  points she had hit earlier and your whole body tenses and seizes for a second your vision blurs  and your mouth stammers and youre stunned for the next round as she lands behind you and walks  around to the front of you youre unable to you cant move you cant speak i can start you on  this path you can return to your wanderlust your allies our kind learns more in /none/ the world than in  a library agree to my instruction to use the skills i teach you as you return throughout your  journeys one day you too can become an expositor you begin to regain control of your  senses and your speech begins to slowly return to you  marisha okay i got to hand it to you that was awesome and i want to know how to do that you  beat me  matt very well your first lesson begins now  marisha okay groan  matt she snaps her fingers and you watch as /none/ zeenoth steps back in sheepishly is it over my  dear is it done i need you to stand here for a second zeenoth i need a body let me show you  the proper pressure points zeenoths eyes go wide for a second i dont believe you owe me  a favor i found her for you did i not zeenoth sighs sags his head and takes his cloak off  marisha i grab that stool and i drag it over  matt now depending on what you wish to learn there are different places where you can pull /none/ the  information from the body over the next few hours working with you and over time  marisha does she beat the shit out of zeenoth  matt you both do  marisha sorry zeenoth sorry god were such assholes  matt assholes that the world needs from time to time  marisha yeah the world does need an asshole well work on that one together well work on  that thats good thats good  matt ill return to zadash in the morning take what i have taught you when you feel its time  for more tutelage /none/ return to me do not worry i have an eye on you  marisha what do i do until then do i just continue  matt do what you must travel the world use what ive taught you learn about injustice those  you dont trust follow them bend them make them tell the truth and admit their guilt find where  ever corruption is root it out and let the system do its job if the system isnt doing its job  destroy the system  marisha why are you doing this why me  matt because a long /none/ time ago i was a wayward girl with no direction was angry and fighting at  the world and someone did this for me  marisha i dont really believe in systems or being a part of them let alone a system that  takes down other systems seems almost hypocritical  matt perhaps who knows maybe one day youll find the corruption inside our own  marisha touche  matt go get some rest clean up a bit i think you could use it  marisha you might have broke my wrist  matt itll heal zeenoth she slaps /tavern/ him awake his unconscious body on the ground  marisha bye zeenoth zeenoth

get you a healing  potion there is no promise that you will still be alive tomorrow i think we should go to natural  remedies you distract the owner while i go in the back and i steal a healing potion its the only  way to guarantee your safety  liam maybe thats the third place that we go i will point out your point which was that these  crazy bastards are very distracting and strange yeah  sam yes  liam so they could be my healing potion /none/ you know well talk about it third place so drag  her off to the burnished bibelots boom in the door  matt you head inside it looks as chaotic as you left

that  just arent quite worth what youd be looking for you do find one art piece that looks like its a  pretty good art piece with a decent frame might be worth a little bit but thats the best you can  find everything else here looks like its the dingy side of the salvation army  sam anything small ooh can i find my old flask that i left here  matt yes ill /none/ let you do that it has not moved from where you placed it  sam im going to steal back my old flask  matt make a sleight of hand check please  liam what is that little dancer toy between the three red mushrooms on the shelf behind you

that fancy bathhouse  that was described to /town/ me last night at the nestled nook  matt you guys make your way southward go ahead and make a general charisma check  liam charisma check well something i wanted to do before we got there was going to do it maybe  in an alley but you tell me is i would like to cast disguise self on myself presumably gone into  an alleyway so no one sees me doing this in the middle of the road i take the form of a man in  very fancy green robes beautiful blond hair very handsome man with /none/ a vomit stain down the front of  my clothes  matt okay

warm dew bathhouse warm dew  laura warm /none/ doo doo  matt dew  liam dew dew theres a liquid u in that  travis warm doo thank you  matt itll be one before you bathe there and the other when you leave  laughter  liam all right lets enter this establishment  matt for as far south as this is its pretty decent compared to the other areas most of the  hillsward you get the sense that a lot of the rural farming community that fills out most of  trostenwald a lot of the money that gets made goes directly to the central /none/ portion of this ward  where this bathhouse is its small but its really well put together as you walk inside you  can see there are marble busts set on the sides of the entrance way each side you can see nice  tapestries that are pulled back over the windows and as both of you walk in you see this young  man maybe his midtwenties or so human but he looks very thin and sickly like he had a rough  upbringing and his general constitution has suffered for it he has a warm smile and hes /none/  wearing these long white robes with what looks to be a yellowish scarf thats wrapped around as he  approaches hello and good morning can i help you  liam yes one moment quietly stay close to me and let me do the talking louder hello please  dont focus my daughter is shy  matt im very sorry  liam ive had a terrible day some disgusting derelict has vomited all over me i smell like  filth and i would like to spend a couple of hours in your finest bath maybe not your finest a good /none/  bath for a couple of hours my daughter and i i will need adjoining baths if you have that for  modestys sake my daughter and i  matt that can be done of course make a persuasion check  liam humming theres a 12  matt for two hours that will run for two baths adjoining well put it at eight silver pieces  liam thats fine i definitely have that i take out the eight silver i slap it down  matt wonderful well show you to your bathroom  liam okay come along dear  sam /none/ yes vater  matt you guys are escorted to what its really offputting for the two of you not only is the  smell clean inside here but theres the scent of lavender in the hallway and you hear soft music  in the distance as you walk past you do see that there is a resident violinist that plays and you  guys are led to these two  sam this is really nice  liam yes it is  sam they got a violinist over there im sorry zey got a violinist over zere vater  liam thats /none/ meine liebchen im hoping for a hot bath for the both of us it has been a long bit of travel  matt right this way leads you into the chambers there is a glass fogged window so the  sunlight comes through but no one can see through there are some linens set out a towel  and two basins that are freshly filled with steaming water you are left into the chamber  liam are they separate though  matt theyre separated by a small wall thats eye length but you can still talk to each other over /none/ it  liam excellent this is called a bath  sam ive heard of them  liam a hot bath we have been pretty dinged up for the past several months and we might not get  back into something like this for a while so i want you to enjoy it go over to your side and i  will be here nott im going to do a bit of reading  sam while you bathe  liam yes  sam youll still be the same caleb when youre done right  liam yes i will be the same /none/ caleb  sam ive just gotten used to you and now youre going to change a bit  liam trust me i will not  sam all right  liam once she is clear of the wall im going to start actually disrobing although i guess the  illusion stays  matt the illusion stays strangely clothes start apparating out of you slurping  marisha its like a bad video game glitch bad texture glitch  liam nott im probably going to go quiet for a little while  sam no problem ill just be over here you know bathing /none/  liam enjoy it i find the second book and examine it am i able to read this  matt you are actually there is one incomplete arcane inscription in there unfortunately its  been too burned beyond recognition you can see this was a spellbook mostly destroyed but there  are two complete spells in there that if you wish to you could transcribe over into your book  those would be arcane lock and unseen servant  all ooh  liam so all my actual clothes are off im going to take the book and set it on /none/ the edge of the basin  matt because you paid for it there is a hinged small desk piece where food can be eaten or  drinks could be served while people are taking a bath  liam i set it down i sit with just my legs in the bath for a moment and i look at the book  exhales  sam im going to find the pitcher of cucumber water dump it on the floor and eat all the cucumbers  laughter  matt as you hear over the wall gobbling  sam look around for anything /none/ in the room that can be stolen  matt plenty of things actually no ones watching theres a vase thats really nice the  doorknob itself is a brass goldlike material  sam ill start working on that  matt using your thieves tools you can get that free if you want  sam after a while i put a toe into the water feel it and im like nah ill use my empty  flask and fill it up with water  matt okay you get a water flask  sam then work on the doorknob  matt okay /none/ go ahead and make a thieves tools check adding your dexterity  sam 12  matt add the dexterity and your proficiency  sam oh 14  matt there you go with very little sound the doorknob comes off and you have now a solid brass  doorknob there is the vase  sam is it a big vase  matt its like that big its more of a decorative flower holder over by the window  sam sure ill try to get that too  matt easy you get it theres nobody watching you  sam ill also save /none/ the flowers in a separate pouch  matt okay there you go  sam any towels ooh you know what  matt yeah the linens can be taken  sam im going to take one towel and tear it into shreds and use it to replace any of my bandages  that have worn or fallen off  matt easy enough theres some nice clean bandages good  sam im good  liam on my side while all of that is happening two things one is that when i finally get into  the tub i dip my whole body /none/ almost entirely in but not my head or hair letting the bruises soak  in the hot water which feels wonderful the second thing is while flipping the pages of this  book very still i can hear all of this and it is extremely endearing but i go completely still  completely quiet and read in peace  matt while you guys are taking a bath the rest of you are going off on a shopping trip except  for you youre going to  taliesin no im going map hunting  matt thats right youre going whos all /town/ going together  laura all of us  matt where are you going  laura okay im going to ask yorda if theres a map maker in town  taliesin or if she can draw us a map of how to get there  matt theres not much of a specific cartographer in place most of the cartography guilds are up  north in either zadash or rexxentrum there might be one in alfield were a bit small over here  you could ask the general store or you could maybe go to the stockade they have maps there but /none/  they use those you might be able to pay enough for them  laura i dont want to go back to the stockade  matt then maybe check the general store or any of the strange book places might have something  old and lying in the back  laura ooh what strange book places  matt well lets see theres the hillsbrook parchment and binding theres the burnished  bibelots that i think one of your friends has already been to those are the two strange book  places im not much of a reader myself so i /none/ couldnt tell you  laura can you draw me a map of how to get to those places  marisha weve already been to the general store  laura yes youre right i guess we can try that place  marisha you can still make her draw a map i dont want to rain on your parade im sorry  travis you

the general store its the large almost wooden  barn exterior the front door opens two ways and the inside is walltowall lined with tools for  farming and farming /none/ equipment for building theres lumber theres all sorts of iron nails  its by all accounts a rural general store  you see on far end is harper the older woman there standing and looking out at the rest  of you hi can i help you what

begin to  play in the back /none/ of your head as she rummages back and forth throughout the interior of the chamber  turning things around and sticking them in the ground it has been completely rearranged  liam old man voice why  is this crowbar seven gold  matt eventually you hear some rummaging from the back room and some footsteps coming nearby and you  quickly stop and return to your original point there and harper mince returns from the back room  she has a few papers in her arms she goes im sorry we dont have any maps of the local area /none/  for detail i have a map of the dwendalian empire as a whole i hope thats enough  laura i mean that could work i suppose its not what we need but if thats what you have  thats what we can buy from you  matt all right let me look at

who said that you wanted to do something right  sam i wanted to go to herbal remedies and /none/ see if we could get you a healing potion  liam lets do that then you lead the way well wait you lead the way outside lets keep our  little schtick going here and then off we go  matt all right as you guys exit  sam auf wiedersehen  matt i trust you enjoyed your time at the bath thank you  liam yes but we have to go sorry im late for a very important appointment i drag nott right  out of here because i saw no doorknob on the door  matt yeah amongst /town/ other things you guys make your way out and beeline it towards the lochward  to where you would find natural remedies the rest of you guys as you approach the exterior amongst the  rest of the buildings in the central city natural remedies is for lack of a better term humble  its a small shack but as soon as you approach it has very strong pungent smells of funguses  travis instant headache  matt yep on the outside you can see right where the doorway is open there are strings of herbs  that are tied /none/ up and left to dry out on the inside you can already see that there are shelves  of various flora and fauna that are being cultivated for various remedies and means of  selling to anybody who wants to come by and procure herbal medicines lets see whos  handling this one because you guys have not been here yet as you enter the main chamber  liam sorry i will say that on the way there that i dropped the disguise somewhere  matt okay easily enough so you guys havent arrived yet you guys have arrived as /none/ you enter the interior  its a very musty smell on the inside too theres a lot of fungus being grown on the inside  here and you can see that elements of it may have expanded into the corners of the actual room and  its not necessarily the nicest space to be wandering in it seems natural across the way  you see a gentleman of relatively tanned skin with darker hair thats ratty and clustered hes  in his late twenties or so looks to be upon closer inspection partial elven blood partial  human blood and /none/ hes in the process of carefully carving a large stalk of what looks like a fungus  off of a small pot that he pulled off one of the shelves as you enter he doesnt even make eye  contact he goes hello please just wait a moment there we are hi can i help you  laura yeah my friends keep dying do you have any health potions  matt we have a handful that is correct how many are you looking to purchase  laura how many do you have  matt four  laura ooh that will /none/ last us probably like a day  matt what do you do for a living  laura were superheroes  taliesin sword jugglers  matt why would fine who am i to ask  marisha look at this bruise  matt i cut fungus for a living  marisha look its in the shape of a dick  matt im not going to ask four did you want them  laura sure yes how much for four healing potions  matt for four healing potions and he pulls them out and plops them on the table 240 gold pieces  /none/ taliesin level two  laura okay hold on i open up my pack and i pour out all my money i start counting it  ashley do you have a deal you know if we got all of them that seems pretty high right that  seems pretty high for a healing potion  matt make a persuasion check with disadvantage yasha the wheeler and dealer  ashley three  matt no actually i think its rather standard in these parts but i can put them back  taliesin healing potions aside you are doing something really interesting and exciting /none/ here  youre not a healing potion dealer what are you doing here like this is fascinating  matt oh i create all sorts of means of tending to wounds and loss of stamina to be honest a lot  of people come around here for performanceenhancing fungus  taliesin i dont know i feel like you can excite me i feel like theres something that you have to  show thats really exciting im not entirely sure its all about stamina i think youve got  something you did that on purpose talk to me like im a child /town/ show me something ive never  seen before  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin not with advantage because i dont have it but i was so excited  matt nope  taliesin persuasion check 19 im fishing for drugs im not going to lie ive been on the road  a long time i dont remember how to do this  matt he leans in close to you mind closing the door  taliesin i skip over to the door and gingerly close it  matt keep curious company thats true  taliesin yes i do and were /town/ leaving town today  matt those are magical words for a man of my business are you a fan of skein  taliesin i dont actually know what that is  matt well and he goes back into the back chamber comes back with a small satchel theres  a finely dried dusted material on the inside it has a grayishblue color to it he goes this is  a dried and ground fungus called skein its called skein because when you eat it you can see  the weave of time  marisha is that what skein means  /none/ matt its a woven skein its a joke on fate never mind  taliesin i thought it was very clever  matt thank you very much its effective its popular on the outskirts where its not so heavily  controlled and carries a huge jailtime if caught how much are you looking to purchase  taliesin ive got to be honest im not made of money but im always curious for a new experience  marisha can i do an insight check on this guy  matt sure go for it  marisha see if hes trying to scam us /none/  matt go for it  marisha can i use my criminal background  matt sure  liam all right marisha said that not beauregard  marisha to know if hes actually giving what hes giving  matt you know what make your insight check  marisha just straight insight  matt straight insight  marisha its not as good as i wouldve hoped 18  matt not as good as i hoped 18  liam thats a slam dunk at level two  matt seems on the level seems excited that somebodys asking about it you get the sense /town/  that maybe he makes a lot of this either for himself or in hopes that somebody asks about it  and is seemingly excited that somebody in this bumfuck town in his opinion would even have  interest you have once encountered this substance before and it does seem legit  marisha okay  ashley how do we know if its good quality though can i give it a sample  taliesin well this might be complicated i think that just what would  travis how about a few experiences  taliesin a few experiences worth what would that /none/ run me  matt hey guys were dealing dd drugs  taliesin im so sorry im so sorry for dragging the entire audience into this hopefully your  children are already asleep i do apologize  sam dd beyond everybody our sponsor for the evening  taliesin thank you for really bringing that to earth for me you started this  matt ill put you in at a gold an experience how about that  taliesin all right yeah put me in for one ill try anything once  matt he takes a small little batch of this dried powdered /none/ fungus and puts it into a small glass  vial corks it and hands it over  ashley well you might as well make another one im not going to let my friend experience it alone  taliesin whats it called skein  matt skein skein i believe thats how its spelled  laura yasha you should take it with them right now itll be fun  taliesin no this is not how this works this is not how this works we bank our moments for those  moments when life is disappointing  travis i know a unique substance /none/ when i see it ill take one as well  taliesin oh my god  marisha one for me too  taliesin this can come in handy in all sorts of ways  matt god damn it guys  taliesin the fact that you had this ready means that there is no shame here you were ready for this  matt youre right i am not making any of this up on the spot at all  taliesin i know i can tell  liam this guy went from the simpsons safeway clerk to the shadiest motherfucker in a snap /none/ of  time because of your question  taliesin a big purple pierced demon walked into the room and was like hello  liam yes can i help you good sir yes i can help you  travis ill tell you what because you are such a purveyor of such interesting items i will take  one of those health potions but for 50 gold thats the running price ive seen in neighboring  towns and i dont mean to be swindled  marisha i assume youd want to go ahead and give it to us for that so that /none/ we keep this a secret  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  travis 21  matt 50 gold and he pulls his hair back a bit seems fair takes a potion and hands it over he  scoops a little vial and says and for fun he throws it over  liam you fucking badass  sam cut to an hour later and someones jamming an adrenaline needle  matt tpk by misuse  taliesin somewhere around level eight this is going to be hilarious somewhere around level  eight somebodys going to go shopping and the rest /none/ of us are going to be like this is now this is  happening now  matt this has become the longest afterschool special i think weve ever experienced  taliesin years in the making  matt he immediately gets nervous at her mention of  taliesin shes fine shes just awful youre a gentleman i hope to see you again im looking  forward to this  matt ill be here  taliesin of course we never met you you never met us  matt of course not i dont know who you are  taliesin i am already /none/ out the door with a flourish  matt at which point you run outside just as caleb and nott are approaching  marisha before i go out i say nice to meet you mister  matt davies  travis the decision was still happening by the time you got to the last letter  marisha i go okay davies  laura i guess ill scoop my money back into my pouch and leave  marisha do you want anything  laura no  matt you bump into caleb and nott on the way out  liam whats the matter do /none/ you have a cold  laura you dont smell bad what did you do  matt actually ironically his clothes do still smell pretty bad and he still looks awful  laura you dont smell as bad  matt thats true on a gradient scale he does smell a little better  liam i will take that as a compliment thank you what are you guys doing here are you shopping  what do they have in there  laura they bought drugs  travis that is an overexaggeration  taliesin that is an extreme overexaggeration we got a health /none/ potion  sam all of you  marisha well it was kind of a ploy to get a cheaper health potion  taliesin it worked  marisha and we got drugs on top of it it was a winwin am i right  laura if you guys go in there and you buy a health potion dont spend as much as he says  because apparently he was lying  liam how much do they run for  travis health potions were quoted at 70 but he was kind enough to understand that 50 was enough  liam 70  /none/ travis gold pieces  sam north we go  taliesin north to the horses  liam we have a plan for the day  laura yes and i show them the map that we just got were heading that way can i take the ribbon  that was wrapped around the map and tie it around one of my horns  matt easily enough  marisha thats cute  laura thank you  sam we could rob the store  liam do you have a strategy for that  sam i mean we could use one of our preplanned strategies /none/  liam which one would that be because i was thinking about it on the walk here and i cant  think which one applies  taliesin i was going to say robbing shady people is usually a bad idea  marisha do we hear them doing these plans do we hear you guys making this plan  liam no i wouldnt be saying this out loud if youre close  sam we could just do the simplest the prince and the pauper  liam heres the thing i have died almost twice in two days we have our friends /town/ and i think  thats a good way to start  sam all right  liam i mean you know we almost all got pinched yesterday  sam youre right we should leave town with our wits about us and full of health lets just go  while were ahead besides i got plenty of stuff today  liam you and me  sam yeah lets go  liam all right okay where are we going first  laura were heading north to  liam is it this big  matt thats the size of the map  laura i /town/ mean we can stop through alfield first and see if theres anything cool there or what  city was it that the academy was in  marisha solstryce  matt and travis soltryce  marisha is that the name of the town  taliesin no i dont think its the name of the town  laura i mean the ultimate goal you guys is to get to hupperdook but  taliesin what about yogurt  laura thats an afterthought  taliesin it usually is  liam how far off does hupperdook look  laura well we have to pass through /none/ felderwin and the felderwin village first  sam lets skip that one please  laura oh is that the one you dont like okay then well go up through alfield and then zadash  and then well cut across and go to hupperdook  marisha is that where your clan is from  sam they roam about  ashley you dont want to go to zadash is that right  marisha nah its cool we can go back  travis its cool now  marisha yeah i mean theres a few places that i didnt get to see in my /town/ sightseeing roundabout  didnt get to hit everything now that ive slept on it ive had a change of heart its a nice town  laura how long of a travel would it be to get to zadash from where we are now  matt following the road is longer but its safest thatll probably be close to 200 miles to zadash  sam jesus were on foot  taliesin no weve got a cart  sam a cart  matt you do have a cart a single cart  laura a horse lets go back to the inn and /none/ ask yorda if she knows if alfield is a big city  liam do i have any knowledge of alfield  taliesin i came though alfield didnt i  matt no you guys traveled around you went from felderwin and curved around to the ustaloch  taliesin thats right  matt alfield is actually slightly smaller than trostenwald its a stop on the way to zadash  zadash is the secondlargest city in the kingdom  marisha what do i know about zadash that i could tell them can i tell them anything  matt it was the last conquered /none/ bastion of the previous government before the empire entirely  took the valley  marisha thats right zadash is on the edge of the empire too right  matt it was but now its more central it expanded past and took over trostenwald alfield  it expanded all the way into the valley  liam will you share your map with me for just one minute  laura of course  sam this is a good trick he does he can look at it once and it will stay with him forever  laura really  sam yes its amazing /none/ you can quiz him on it later while hes memorizing it yasha is that your name again  ashley yasha  sam its like ash with an ay  ashley not really but close enough  sam i got you these flowers  ashley oh  sam thought that they might gussy you up a bit its a lot of drab colors also maybe you wont  kill me now  ashley im not going to kill you  sam i know i gave you the flowers  ashley

flowers and ill put them in between the other pages and ill put it away  sam you see  laughter  /none/ sam it doesnt hurt to be nice sometimes  marisha i mean it can though  sam well it hurts you  liam it looks like somebody was very nice to you the night before over and over again  marisha oh she was  laura you guys we are going to zadash is that what were saying were going to go to zadash  liam sure lets do that whats our goal in zadash  laura i dont know i just need to know where were going okay  marisha thats on the way to the solstryce academy  /none/ matt the soltryce solstice i can see you mixing it up the soltryce is technically in rexxentrum  which is the capital of the empire  laura which is a lot farther  matt which is a lot farther zadash does have the only other subsidiary of the academy there but  the main soltryce academy is in rexxentrum the capital but zadash has some connection to it  travis ill take it  liam unless youre a foreigner everyone knows about rexxentrum  matt yes its huge for player comparison its twice the size of emon its a massive /town/ city  laura zadash  matt no not zadash rexxentrum  liam zadash is medium or smaller  laura okay yeah  liam how far did that map say when i looked at it 200 miles you said to zadash  matt to zadash roughly 200 miles or so if youre taking the road quicker if you take a  straight line but youre not as safe  liam well i think its good  sam are we going to walk there should we get horses  taliesin we have a horse  liam how many horses  taliesin we /none/ have a horse  marisha a horse and a carriage im assuming it cant fit all of us  travis yeah like a wagon  taliesin we have a wagon  matt itll be about the same pace as on foot at a fast pace on foot you guys can traverse about  30 miles a day that also means youre moving at a fast pace so youre not being completely aware of  your surroundings you have a penalty to passively seeing things around you but you get there quicker  travis i like it  taliesin why be /town/ fast what are we in a rush for  laura we can sightsee  taliesin i find careful is always best  liam a couple of weeks on the road to a city bigger than this one  marisha are we all going to get along for a couple of weeks  sam well find out i suppose  laura i get along with everyone beau  marisha thats true thats true  taliesin i dont get along with anybody  marisha thats

ashley i think i need to stay here just a little bit longer but i will meet you guys there at some point  sam why whatre you doing  liam you have something else to do  ashley i just dont think i can

goblin  matt the sound that comes out is less of a yeehaw and more of a screech sound the horse  immediately /town/ rises up and goes into a very heavy gallop and the cart takes off ahead of you and  you all struggle to catch up for a bit with that you guys quickly try and saunter up heading  northward along the road towards the direction of alfield and eventually zadash as you head  further into
