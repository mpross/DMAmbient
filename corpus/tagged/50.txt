us dive into the insanity of the feywild in  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music /town/  matt welcome back everybody so getting us into the story for this evening the backstory of the  current episode vox machina in attempting to find ways to topple and destroy the chroma  conclave have found their way around the world seeking items called the vestiges of divergence  artifacts of great power that should aid them in their attempt to take down thordak the cinder  king the red dragon who now sits lording over the central town of emon at the center of taldorei  their recent journey has brought them into the feywild a pseudoparallel /none/ plane of fey magic  chaos and all sorts of goodness in between theyve wandered through met an old friend in  nala the nymph of the lake discovered a fantastically artistically talented satyr by the  name of garmelie and had a trip to the city of syngorn the elven city from taldorei which had  phased into this realm for safety when the dragons of the conclave attacked after a fateful  remeeting with the parents of vex and vax discussions were had hats were attempted to be  stolen by the leader of the city and successfully /none/ done so the other half of agreements were  pseudoachieved  taliesin read your contract  matt and they made their way northward through the evershifting grasses to the outskirts of the  moonbrush a heavy heavy forested wood that will lead them to their destination after that which  is the gilded run a series of rivers that wrap around their final destination the shademirk bog  where apparently this vestige exists  so diving in where we were the last time you guys had managed to wander a few hours into the  southern portion of the forest /dung/ of the moonbrush coming through you realize that as opposed to  the rest of the feywild youve encountered so far which exists in a perpetual dusk there is an  actual starry sky and moonlight poking through of a full moon at portions of the canopy of this  forest cruising ever forward you stumbled upon what looked like some sort of a cave or cavern  with a series of small stone and wooden trinkets and gifts that were left outside as well as  carved bones and rotting fruits and you came to realize that these were /none/ probably left for the  spiritual entity that lived and existed within this cavern  upon some of these gifts being disturbed the bear attacked and vexahlia summoned forth trinket  her faithful companion bear a battle took place putting trinket in a difficult position but upon  a brief discussion with this spirit bear had proven himself a worthy entity and was bestowed a  boon further solidifying the bond between vexahlia and her faithful companion trinket  and that was where we left off  sam didnt you just get some card or something right at the end /none/ of  laura yeah i did  sam did we know what it was  laura yeah i did  taliesin it was a free 50 coupon for lyft  laura what im really excited about is that card was at the live show and it is not in my stuff  right now but i did  matt she reaches for the necklace around her neck which is suddenly not there  laura no i do however still have my title  travis you guys are still by yourselves right you two  marisha are vex and i still /none/ separated  matt no the trees have relaxed the canopy has reopened above the small clearing and the rest of  the party you can now see vex on her back on the ground trinket standing over her towards the  cavern and keyleth pulled back looking a bit shocked and confused  marisha and is oralan still there is that his name  matt the bear spirit the bear spirit upon passing through vex and trinket then dissipated  into a spark of naturalized druidic magic and vanished  marisha so were alone  matt you are now alone /none/ in the center of that clearing  sam oh my gods what just happened  laughter  laura everythings under control were alive  sam i heard growling did the bear try to kill you i mean trinket  laura no yeah trinket tried to kill me but dont worry everythings fine  marisha really glad you learned how to speak with animals  laura me too keyleth can you open up the trees so our friends can get in  marisha who our what who  laura arent we blocked off  matt the trees have laxed and reopened /dung/  laura i was busy looking for my card and i found it hi guys my name is vexahlia cool yes  were good can i search for that tea set that i tried to give him  sam tea set what just happened  matt make an investigation check  laura cool balls off to a good start  taliesin id like to take a look in the cave as well a little bit  matt okay  laura ten  matt okay yeah it takes you a little bit about ten minutes or so parts of it got /dung/ scattered and  lost amongst the rest of the objects left around but you manage to reassemble your collection of  tea accessories  laura yeah cool it was a golden cursed tea set  travis nobody else is concerned about the commotion that happened behind the trees and  were all just like hi what happened  laura there was a big fucking bear you might actually not want to look in that cave because it  came out of there and it was rather angry when it did  liam what it what came out  laura a /none/ guardian spirit of the forest  taliesin just observing the entrance to see if theres anything written any type of language on  any of the entrances or otherwise  matt make an investigation check  marisha as a druid would i know about guardian animal spirits  laura yeah would we have heard anything about this in our studies  matt in your studies no you make a history check  marisha thats not my strong suit man  matt well go with nature  marisha oh thats better okay 23  taliesin 21  matt there are no /none/ markings that currently are visible around the entrance or exit of the cavern  itself it is carved however meaning that this cavern whether it be natural or not this  entrance has been touched by humanoid hands and has been refined you keyleth do know that  occasionally on the material plane there are entities spiritual energies that gather based on  worshipping specific fey spirits and these creatures over time these spiritual energies  begin to take the form that their worshipers give them it takes a long time for this transition to  happen and essentially these /dung/ guardian spirits usually guarding some sort of a powerful fane or  a magical core or center they become protector spirits of that region  marisha so because people just manifested the god as a bear it slowly turned into a bear  matt it turned into a bear and theyre not gods per se but theyre powerful entities that guard  that element  marisha spirit guardians okay  travis whats in the cave  laura whats in the cave keyleth  marisha nothing now i dont think  laura there was a spirit bear in there  liam /none/ it was a bear  laura it was a big fucking bear yeah  marisha it was made out of stars and space stuff  travis are you sure you havent been eating mushrooms or something  laura trinket popped out and he saved us trinket fucking saved us scanlan  sam pics or it didnt happen  laughter  travis thats exactly what i was thinking  liam i go over to trinket and i surreptitiously start feeding him biscuits you dont know  biscuits that i took from my fathers house good boy thats a good boy good /dung/ job  matt theyre gone in a matter of moments licks the side of your face leaving some saliva and crumbs  liam i will always give you that shit dont forget  marisha percy did you find anything in the cave  taliesin nothing of consequence  travis how far in did you go  taliesin no that looks dark and there was a giant cosmic bear in there  marisha would i know if after the spirit guardian has passed would he just go back in his cave  matt you dont know that much about the entity /dung/ youve never really encountered one before youve  only heard about them  laura what about garmelie would he know  matt youre welcome to ask him if you want to  laura hey garmelie what do you know about this fucking bear  matt hes in the very back just watching you guys i know what you know its apparently here  and people leave him little presents and seemed pretty scary from the way you describe him so  travis did you know he was going to be here at this cave  matt no i would have /dung/ avoided this  travis somebody insight check that little bastard  laura yeah ill insight check that little bastard  matt roll insight  travis i would do it but eh  laura 18  matt 18 he seems like hes telling the truth hes hard to read in general because hes such a  strange individual but yeah  laura i feel like he wouldve told us to avoid it  marisha and bears are fairly territorial i dont know it might be wise to stay out of the cave  taliesin i think in general its probably best /dung/ to respect anythings home on this plane of  existence  travis boring scanlan you want to go in  sam if you do  liam were not here to go spelunking why are we going to go in this cave  travis oh my god were in the feywild were about to pull a bow out of a tree and you dont  want to see whats in the creepy cave  laura maybe we should save our strength for the fucking bow in the tree  liam plus do you know theres a theater here  matt were /none/ not going to the theater  liam i understand but just so we dont accidentally go there where is it in relation to  this tree is it on the way  matt i couldnt tell you certain things move shift change location  sam its a touring production  liam i dont trust anyone who doesnt like the theater what exactly is your issue with it  matt dont worry about it anyway shall we and he begins marching back  laura i really dont think we should mess with this thing  marisha look grog i touched a /none/ flower and the whole realm almost collapsed okay i dont know  travis i know im looking at the scandalous one over there thats always trying to get little  goodies for himself  taliesin im not feeling this one i dont know what can i tell you i normally like to gamble and  im not feeling a gamble on this one  travis all right you went boop im just saying  taliesin its just not pretty enough its really not pretty enough weve already won something here  travis all right fine im happy  sam im /dung/ one hundred percent behind any decision you made or make by the way you say go we go  you say stay we stay  travis what if we run touch the back of the cave run back we dont even have to pick up  anything just to say we did it  marisha last time i touched something i didnt hear the end of it and now were just going to  let this happen  taliesin well yes because we dont care if they die  travis what all the bad shit already came out of it /none/ what do you say  sam by that logic mathematically theres no more bad shit in there  taliesin is there anybody here of reasonable intelligence who wants to stop this from  happening just checking  liam i dont think that we should do anything it does seem like a bit of a double standard that  everybody threw poo at keyleth for picking a flower  taliesin deadpan please whatever you do dont do it my god please  travis i know hes got the raised eyebrows im not sure if we should do it or not  /dung/ matt im just enjoying the conversation make your choices  marisha you do you man you do you guys  taliesin if youre going to do it have a light source  travis what ten or higher we go  sam ten or higher we go  travis natural 20  sam laughing were so going  travis i put scanlan on my back and we run straight into the cave  taliesin i hand a torch  travis i dont want any torch ive got darkvision  matt they go darting into the cave vanishing into the shadows and /none/ out of sight the two of you  continue for about 30 40 50 60 feet thankfully both of you have darkvision so you  can see pretty well in this area you can see what are a number of alcoves that are carved into the  sides of the rock here that contain extinguished candles sometimes clusters of them that are left  in here in some sort of ceremonial way but have just burned out or not been lit in a long time it  goes straight back theres no curvature or natural change in the path of /none/ this cavern  you get about 100 feet into the foot of this spirelike mountain one of many that protrude  from the center of the moonbrush and the chamber widens and comes to an end a circular pocket at  the end about maybe 40 feet across on each side the floor of this room is entirely covered in  unlit candles except for in the center there is a raised stone platform that contains a singular  skull made of some sort of a bluish or aquamarine crystal  sam thats not what i was expecting  travis /none/ jackpot  sam jackpot  travis we are the greatest ones in the group are the candles standing up or are they laying over  matt theyre standing up  sam we cant take the skull  matt its a large skull its like this big and its elongated snout  sam oh its an animal skull  matt its a beastlike skull  taliesin is it a bear skull  travis we have not said anything to the rest of the group  taliesin oh i thought they were saying this out loud  sam can i discern what /none/ kind of animal skull it is  matt make a nature check  travis can i do one as well  matt sure yeah you would yeah as a traveling herd member you would know cleaning creatures and stuff  sam eight  matt you have no idea what creature this is it does look bestial in nature  liam are you dead yet  sam still alive everythings okay its all gold and silver  travis yeah theres nothing that moves in here  marisha keyleth talks to the rest who stayed out okay percy do you have an /none/ hourglass thing  taliesin no but i can keep very good count though  marisha we should play that gambling game  taliesin all right  marisha okay i bet how much gold do i have  laura how much gold do you have  marisha three gold  laura thats it  taliesin we keep taking it from her  marisha thats true that we have to run in after and save them  liam i dont want to take that bet  marisha youre going to take that bet  liam no i dont want to take that /dung/ bet because i agree with you  taliesin ill take that bet ill take a threegold bet  marisha okay that they come out safe and sound  taliesin 200 seconds  marisha 200 seconds all right  matt meanwhile inside the cave the two of you now stand at the edge of this room filled with  small wax structures and wicks that are currently cold in the darkness and the central platform  holding the crystalline skull in the center  travis in that circular area is there anything on the back wall more candle sconces  matt /none/ you cant make out any details it looks like somewhat rough cavern walls but not very  smoothly carved or anything  travis and the skull is big like the size of my chest  matt its probably a little bit smaller than that  sam made of gems or stone or bone  matt it looks almost like it was carved and hollowed from a singular giant solid piece of opal  or aquamarine like its a gemmed skull in the sense that its made from gem material  travis does it look like it could have been a /none/ bear skull  matt you dont know mister naturerollof12  sam oh god  travis well  sam listen grog i dont think its very valuable  travis no but look at it  sam its pretty amazing  travis were in a secret chamber  sam this is cool but what would we do with it we cant trade it  travis i bet they worshiped it  sam i bet something still worships it and that thing could come back and be mad if we take it  travis are there a crapload of footprints on the ground /none/ around us  matt make a perception check  travis 13  matt its hard to tell youve arrived both paced in your space there so there are plenty of  footprints that you guys have left its hard to see if there are any more recent ones are from  other creatures  travis want to take a candle as a souvenir  sam i wouldnt mind getting a closer look at that skull  travis yeah well lets do that then  liam 100 seconds have gone by  sam we cant walk over there without disturbing candles /none/ right  matt probably not unless youre balletstyle en pointe  travis i can throw you taking it back to the old school thats a little careless  sam i can grab it i do have a big hand  travis thats like getting your hand on it right away its pushing the button  sam what do we do do we just leave and come up with a good story  travis ooh yeah  sam okay here how about this let me cut your face  travis okay  sam when we run out youll be bleeding and /none/ crying and itll be horrible and well just make  something up  travis okay laughing perfect are you ready to go  sam yeah yeah sure  travis we take off wait youve got to cut me wait where are you going to cut me  sam right above the eyebrow so theres lots of blood yeah  travis yeah right in the middle like the bruce willis cut okay  matt ah sir bruce willis of emon dangerous life he led in history  travis but not too deep right i want to be able to still make /none/ the ladies swoon  sam okay cool ill take out my not mythcarver  travis why not you were going to cut me with a vestige  liam youre going to roll a 20 and decapitate him  sam i take out my other longsword my aberration bane longsword  matt laughing are you an aberration  sam ill slice him right over one of the eyebrows  matt okay you take one point of damage and the goliath blood doth flow aplenty  travis grunting are you ready lets sell this shit and i put him on my back /none/ and we take off  running yelling oh its horrible  sam yelling there are bears everywhere bears little bears big bears  travis we burst out into the sunlight and i intentionally trip and eat shit scanlan goes  flying boom  sam there was a bear right on grog  travis oh my god it was so vicious  sam it was horrible  laura you didnt fight them at all  travis no there were bodies everywhere children women they were stapled to the ceiling  and then there were just horrible  marisha so did the /none/ bear only have one claw  matt make a deception check  liam this guy wants to go to the theater  travis 15  matt ill have the rest of you roll an insight check  marisha this is the lucky one  liam oh man that sounds scary  laura 23  marisha 27  taliesin nine  sam i was in the mouth of a bear and grog cut the thing from asshole to lips to get me out of  there it was crazy  laura thats disgusting so there was really nothing there  marisha /none/ i think that means you owe me three gold percy  taliesin sighing oh bloody hell  sam did you bet to see whether we would live or die  taliesin no not at all  laura what did you really find in there  sam some candles  laura yeah  travis and a big skull  sam big skull a gemmed skull not gemmed a gemlike skull not diamonds not rubies opal  something  travis we reached out to touch it and it cut my face  laura that sounds terrible i wish pike was here she /none/ would really enjoy this story  sam it was a worthless endeavor were sorry we went  liam hey how about that chroma conclave eh  taliesin wait so the candles and skulls were there or they werent there  travis yeah there were a ton of candles and a skull  sam seems like a place of worship or devotion and we didnt want to mess with it  marisha well a lot of these spirit guardians tend to have worshipers and a lot of times theyll  bring them gifts so that makes sense yeah i probably should /none/ have told you guys that before you  went in sorry  travis theres only one show in a day we dont want to miss it  laura i like how all of us sound like weve lost our voice  marisha yeah it sounds like weve all been through hell okay  travis well since i touched the skull and i cut myself could you do me a little clicks tongue  laura you want me to lick it  travis no dont you have a thing  laura like healing like you want me to use a whole /none/ spell on this teensyass wuss cut  travis if you care about me  laura i cast cure wounds on his little teenyweeny cut  travis oh that feels so much better  sam vex what do you think is a semiprecious gemstone skull worth going in and getting  laura i think we should remember this place is well its probably going to disappear after we  walk away these things tend to move dont they  liam we should move toward our destination  laura we need to focus on the bow and its really hard to say /none/ that but i really  taliesin the whole theory of a path is youre supposed to somewhat stay on it i imagine  laura so stay on it  liam no more stops unless its for the theater were not stopping again  sam what time is it  matt from what you can tell it looks like its in the evening with the moon up  sam and weve been awake for a while  matt full journey here since you rested make an intelligence check  sam natural 20 except disadvantage because im exhausted 16 plus two  /none/ matt okay after resting just outside of the moonbrush its probably been three hours since  you woke  sam oh  travis were good  laura oh we rested  matt did you guys push on when you got there  liam i was wondering the same thing  marisha i thought we camped on the outskirts  taliesin whatever we decide right now is exactly what happened  marisha right so we camped and we got up right  taliesin yes what yes of course  travis i agree  matt i feel like there would have camping /none/ before going straight into the moonbrush and i think you  may have been pressed for time at the event last time to try and do that  sam all i know is my mansion spell has been ticked off so i used it at least once in the last  47 hours  marisha yeah i feel like we camped out right before we went into the moonbrush  taliesin we camped out right before that  matt right so its been a few hours since you regained consciousness it wouldnt have made a  huge difference per se /none/ but you were still reading the book youre close now at this point  sam yeah im close  matt a handful of hours away from completing it  laura so i can take off this negative seven hit points that i dont even remember how i got  probably  matt actually that you would have gotten from the large bear so no  laura youre right  matt nice try all right so as you guys gather here garmelie goes all right so duskward is  that way whos leading  taliesin you are  matt oh im /none/ not leading im guiding you  laura you guide in the front  matt im guiding you duskward ive never been inside the moonbrush i know of things around it  laura how were you planning to guide us through it if you dont even know how to do it  sam he was just going to get us to the outskirts that was always the plan  matt im getting you to your destination by helping guide you there  marisha but if you cant guide us through the moonbrush  matt i am guiding you through the moonbrush /none/ i just think somebody should take the lead  marisha but you said youve never been here  taliesin he wants something big in the front  marisha yeah im just wondering what his use will be from here on out  laura how about you and i we can be in the front  liam shes duchess of the grape hunt so shes very good to lead  matt great wondrous thatll work fine  laura duchess of the grape hunt what a wonderful title  marisha hang on a second garmelie huddle real quick why dont we send /none/ him home he could die  taliesin im all right with that  marisha hes not going to be any use from here on out hes never been here  sam he knows things about the feywild that we dont know  laura the only thing i worry about is we made a deal with him  taliesin hes under contract which means that there are places and things he might be able to  help us with  laura he shook our hand  travis yeah it couldnt hurt  taliesin its worth having him  sam also if /none/ it turns out hes not who he says he is  marisha which im starting to get a very strong feeling of  sam well find out who he really is later  liam hes a bit of a sneak too the only reason we have him is because you spotted him  because youre awesome  travis and he wanted a hat how bad could he honestly be  laura right it looks very good on him  taliesin i feel like hats are almost a traditional sign of something a little iffy  present company included of course /none/  marisha we got betrayed by clarota at the 11th hour so  liam were so much cooler now  sam all right lets just put vex and vax  laura hold my hand dear  matt all right he takes your hand roll a survival check  liam he eats her hand  laura 17  matt 17 okay holding your hand you guys quietly begin to make your way through the  moonbrush  laura eyes out for any things  matt youre in your natural element also its a forest  sam grog can i ride on /none/ you  travis girl you can always ride  sam yeah i just need to be reading  matt much like a kid in the backseat of a car on a cell phone scanlan is just reading through the  book on the back of grog  marisha station wagon facing backwards  laura you can always ride on trinket too scanlan  sam no grog weirdly smells better than trinket today  matt about another two hours of travel duskward and hes keeping a finger pointed in the  direction which is difficult for you because the moon placement /none/ in the sky has not changed the  correlation as to what you normally use in the prime material plane to gauge direction has no use  here whatsoever so the best that you can do is try to keep yourself facing forward and using his  occasional guidance to steer back on track  laura im going to try to learn from him how hes gauging his surroundings and stuff  matt make an insight check  laura 21  matt 21 he seems to every single time he checks for the direction lick his finger and then point /none/  theres nothing more to it than that hell take a moment to think and look around lick his finger  point in a direction  marisha can i do a nature check to see if i feel a breeze at all or is he bullshitting  liam are they way ahead of us or are they just up ahead  marisha 16  matt there is no breeze there is no sound in the forest here there is no sound of leaves  clattering hes just doing that  marisha because it makes him seem smart  laura what /none/ does the licking do  matt licking is how i initiate the specialization of my arcane understanding of the  flow and ebb of the fey  laura youre bullshitting  matt no this is a technique and its leading us to your destination have a little faith you  hired me for a reason  laura so much faith in you  liam is he taking us to the theater right now  laura definitely the theater  matt not the theater pressing on i want you to make another survival check  laura natural 20 and i dont /none/ even need to roll again  matt all right  marisha as we go i just want to druidcraft little green pebbles no lets do brighter red  pebbles to start leaving behind hansel and gretel style  travis lead something right to us  marisha little pebbles tiny pebbles that i can recognize  matt okay so youre creating small stones that trail behind you as you go  marisha every hundred feet or so  matt as you guys progress forward you start finding patches where the ground itself gets a  little mushier like either theres a /none/ nearby river or the ground itself has retained liquid more than  other areas of the forest you begin to see the faint appearance of familiar green sprouts that  come through these are mandrakes and you manage to catch them before the rest of the party gets  there you and garmelie especially with your sight and knowledge of this area you manage to  guide the party around that whole field of waiting mandrake  laura what do they do do they just scream a lot  matt you dont know you may find out yet progressing forward /none/ into the next section i need  you to make another survival check  laura oh no 12 oh doubledouble thats better 25  matt 25 shit girl eventually you come to what appears to be a river thats cutting through this  portion of the moonbrush just on the other side of that river you hear a faint sound of music  marisha the theater  laura whispering what is that  matt what is what i dont  laura the music do you hear it  matt no  travis hold on are you saying you dont hear /none/ anything right now  matt actually right now nobody hears it except for you  laura what does it sound like  matt it sounds like a soft violin with a hint of flute and a drum beat its very simple its  very basic  laura does it sound pleasant  matt it does sound pleasant it sounds folksy and whimsical its very very faint  laura there must be people further in  sam you hear music  laura yes  taliesin could be dangerous  sam can i listen  matt the rest of you guys as /none/ you gather up you begin to hear the sound and so does garmelie  garmelies like we really dont need to go in that direction  laura do you know anything about music playing randomly in the woods  matt music can be good it can be bad who knows dangerous music is very often a thing in  places you dont understand i would not recommend wandering into places of phantom music  travis we should check it out  sam i want to hear some music  laura what direction is it coming from  matt you take /none/ a few steps there is still a river which is about 15 feet across its a soggy  bank that leads into a lazily running river so you have to cross that first it looks to be a  little ways duskward and to your right  travis have to cross the river  liam we dont need to stick a stick into every beehive we come across  sam but this is the theater  liam is it the theater  taliesin we dont know actually know it could be anything  laura it could also be a camp /tavern/  taliesin it could be many things  sam do i recognize the music  matt you dont actually its not a classic ditty the structures are familiar you can see  where the basis of a lot of bar shanties come from a similar bouncing beat to it but nothing  that catches you as really familiar  laura whispered ugh i want to see what it is thats doing it though  travis right but we got to cross this river to get to it  laura we have to do it regardless yes  marisha how big /none/ is the river  matt 15 feet across  sam its a stream its nothing  travis he said its lazy right its just going along but i call bullshit cause were in the  feywild  taliesin youre very clever about that  liam you said we have to get across regardless garmelie  matt well yes if were heading toward your destination we have to cross  marisha we have to get across the river regardless  sam can you make us a bridge keyleth  marisha i can control water and part the river for a second /none/  sam well thats even better  laura for a hot second  marisha for a hot second yeah i was trying to stop myself i cast control water and make us a  little bubble as we walk  matt okay so you watch as the stream begins to separate  marisha i dont want to moses this i want to give us a little bubble that we stealthily walk  under the river with the little bubble  matt you guys find your way walking down onto the bank of the river your boots sinking into the  /none/ very soft soggy bottom of the river you walk across make your way to the other side the river  splashes as the bubble is no longer required you traverse it no issue its a river the music is  a little louder on this side of the bank and is off to the right side  sam should we send vax ahead  liam i dont think its a good idea but if were going to check it out you and i should go ahead  yeah lets go  laura garmelie do you want to come with us /none/ go invisible  matt um okay  laura i will hold your hand dont worry dear  matt all right so he vanishes from sight the two of you guys make your stealth checks  laura oh can i cast pass without a trace on us  matt if you want to  laura im going to do that  liam all right  matt all right so adding plus ten to your stealth rolls  liam 39  laura whoa 28  matt all right the rest of you are staying behind  marisha yeah  matt so you /none/ two and garmelie make your way upwards pushing past bushes and the trees here  in the moonbrush which are getting thicker and thicker the further north you go you hear the  music getting louder and louder and its funny you find yourself tapping the side of your leg to  it its a nice beat you begin to hear laughter sounds like jovial laughter like people having a  good time just a few voices you hear two different voices going back and forth laughing  liam our mother read us stories about shit like this  laura /none/ did she  liam yes she did  laura i dont remember  liam fairies grumpkins i dont know its probably going to end badly do you want to go  have a look  laura i just wanted to see but if youre worried about it we dont have to  sam oi you lot i just had a thought  liam why start now  sam if theres music there could be some sort of charm effect  laura oh  sam would you like me to come with and maybe counter that charm effect  marisha the /none/ bard is just now figuring this out  laura get on up here you stealthy fuck  sam all right i put down my book and hop off of grog and go up there  marisha i sit down with percy  laura add ten to it because of pass without a trace  sam i dont think you cast it on me did you  laura i cast it on everybody thats within 30 feet of me  sam am i there yet im exhausted  matt yeah its at disadvantage  sam same what is it  taliesin /none/ stealth plus ten  sam oh hey thats 18 thats not bad  laura would have been eight jesus  marisha i sit down with percy and i say six gold that after 200 seconds they run out screaming  again  sam can i be doing countercharm can i hum a little tune is that how it works i dont know  how it works  matt well its time for you to learn how one of your abilities works here sam for countercharm  as an action you set up a performance that lasts until the end of /none/ your next turn during that time  you and any friendly creature  sam it lasts six seconds  matt hold on you can keep doing it every round if you want to it doesnt say theres a limit to it  sam all right ill keep humming  matt they have to hear you to be affected by it it has to be loud enough for them to hear you  sam sure ill hum loudly  liam you want to break our stealth  matt its going to happen  sam shit  matt yeah one way or /none/ the other youve got countercharm or keeping stealthed  laura aw fuck  sam well stealth and if it starts to feel icky then ill do it  laura okay all right  i basically just want to see what the fuck is laughing i want to see what it is  liam if i do not see a mummers show from this there will be hell to pay now lets go  matt so the three of you and garmelie whos invisible at this point in time you approach what  looks to be a clearing ahead of you /none/ now the trees actually disperse a bit you can see what appears  to be a small campfire thats crackling in the center of this clearing and the music is actually  quite loud now you see figures jaunting around this fire and holding hands and swirling for a  second and then separating then dancing a little ways around it again  laura what kind of figures  matt you have to get closer  laura fuck fuck this fuck it im not doing it  liam i will go closer  laura no dont fucking go closer i /none/ get a really bad feeling all of a sudden i get a really bad  feeling about this  liam 39 stealth  laura im behind a tree  matt youre behind a tree garmelie is staying with you what are you doing  sam can i sing to him through the earring no we talked about that before  matt no the effect has to be within hearing so either you go up with him or you stay behind  sam im going to stay behind  matt okay so vax you come up to the very edge of /none/ the clearing you vanish you come to the very  edge of the clearing you see before you where the laughters coming from there is an elf in full  verdant guard armor of syngorn who is skipping and laughing around the fire dancing alongside  what appears to be a bipedal humanoid creature covered in fur with claws a longer snout and  they are both smiling and holding each others hands and spinning and twirling each other and  dancing around  laura theyre totally charmed  matt you see the music is actually coming from a floating /none/ spectral violin flute and drum unmanned  by any creature just slowly drifting around the clearing around the entities that are dancing i  also need you to make a wisdom saving throw  marisha ah there it is  laura oh jeez is it a charm effect  liam yeah is it because i have advantage if its a charm effect  matt you do  liam and ill use one luck for the day first luck all right 17  matt 17 okay looking forward you find a tapping on the side of your hip as the beat /none/ finds  you and you begin to drift out of the shadows into the center of this clearing you look over  and see as the guard extends his hand and takes yours the beat kicks into you a smile creeps  across your face  laura i take my broom out and i start flying up and i grab scanlans hand and take him on the  broom with me  sam where we going  laura were going to fucking get vax out of there  sam i start singing  matt okay  sam countercharm jazzy saxophone /none/ riff  matt the gentle sounds of careless whisper keeping any possible invasion of your mind at bay  hopefully you just hear garmelie behind you going no what are you doing echoing through the  trees as you guys dart in towards the center of this camp you  liam im on man im lit  matt you are totally on this is an amazing experience you feel the color and the music  surging through you and all through this endless surge of energy inside as you begin to now join  into this other dancing trio  /none/ liam fucking werewolf guy look good  matt yeah you guys dart into the center of this hearing the music hearing the laughter watching  your brother with a jokerlike smile on his face the sheer joy pulling his expression into one of a  very disturbing joy i need both of you guys to make wisdom saving throws with advantage  liam oh dear  taliesin advantage versus magic  sam yeah i already had advantage  taliesin well there you go  sam 13  laura 23  matt 23 all right you sweep in at this point /none/ and find that scanlan jumps off the broom  laura no dont jump off the broom  matt you tumble down make an athletics check acrobatics  sam save check ten check or save  matt check  sam ten  matt okay you catch yourself it wasnt a large fall you land on your feet down on the ground  with a crunch a number of things crunch and break beneath your feet as you stand up and you look up  and see as vax this elvish warrior knight and a straightup wolfman all lead you into the /none/ dance  and the four of you now begin to take each others hands and laugh and skip around in a circle  laura im going to try to pok√©ball vax into my necklace  matt okay  laura okay im going to try to do that  taliesin im hearing this cacophony and im slowly getting up with a sigh and moving in the  direction of the campsite  marisha you might have won this bet this time percy  laura not yet  taliesin slow walk youve got time  marisha im holding onto my six gold /none/  laura you have to make a wisdom saving throw against me  liam okay  laura whyd you roll twice  liam because i have advantage against charm  laura its not charm it was just wisdom  liam oh then i rolled shit its just a five  laura then he goes in the pok√©ball  matt you are pulled into the necklace im really going to push to refer to it as a necklace  laura sorry necklace the ravens slumber necklace  matt im going to really push to have it be called a necklace vax /none/ all of a sudden youre  pulled out of this dance and your head is clouded for a second as you find yourself in a singular  darkened stone room four walls a single stone throne in the center of it facing out towards a  glass window the size of the other walls it shows an image of the perspective of the necklace  liam first conscious person to go in here  matt second technically  marisha second to grog  liam grog was unconscious  travis no i wasnt  sam he was very close to death /none/  laura can i grab scanlan  matt you can  sam im doing the russian bottle dance from fiddler on the roof right now  matt its fantastic  laura i want to fly down and get him around the waist and pull him out  matt make an athletics check i need you to make an acrobatics check  sam check  matt yes so roll and add your acrobatics with disadvantage  sam 11  laura athletics  matt yes  laura oh thats strength isnt it oh sorry 17  matt 17 you manage to grab /none/ scanlan pull him onto the broom with you the two other dancers  immediately reach up and grab him and try to pull him back down into it at this point you look  into their faces and you can see while they have smiles on them their eyes are fearful and  desperate their bodies are emaciated and exhausted they both look like their physical  bodies are on the edge of collapse from nonstop dancing for god knows how long you glance down at  the ground around you and you can see numerous piles of broken bones /none/ and discarded armor all  order of other creatures that have befallen this spot amongst the forest and never left theyre  pulling against you were making opposed strength checks go ahead and roll  marisha come on vex  laura fuck im so weak you guys  matt so are they right now though theyre heavily emaciated  laura just a regular strength check its not a saving throw  matt nope  laura 11  matt 11 you feel as scanlan who was shoving off of you instinctually and both of these bodies  grabbing his legs and /none/ pulling him down off the broom he is pulled from your grasp hits the  ground and the three of them continue their dance completely nonchalant not even paying  attention to your presence at this point  laura i fly away minor problem it was really a very bad idea to go towards the music however  scanlans enchanted and we should probably save him because it looks like a lot of people have  also been enchanted and are stuck there forever if youre going to come and try to save him plug  your fucking ears because /none/ i have a feeling this music is cursed and i start shoving shit in my ears  taliesin keyleth can you druidcraft some cotton  marisha sure you owe me six gold  taliesin no were going to save them you owe me six gold  marisha but shes running back out screaming three and three we split the gold threethree it  was a draw  taliesin vex could you go fetch a pail of water  marisha wait hang on how about this you guys i believe as an elemental im immune to  charm effects  laura /none/ well then fucking get in there and help him  sam you should do more than believe that you should probably know that  laura maybe be an elemental and shove some shit in your ears  travis if i got into a rage i cant be charmed  marisha thats true  taliesin theres nothing to be done about that its a campsite correct im going to start  wandering until at least i have a sense of the size of it  marisha youre right i druidcraft the cotton  matt all right cool you guys all make /none/ your way back towards the direction of this little opening  this gap in this grove  laura im going to let him out of the pok√©ball before we get him out  sam there seems to be some distortion going on im doing that thing with the wolfman where im  miming a lasso and pulling him closer to me to dance closer  matt sure and theyre into it it is unlike a song youve ever heard and everything else fades  away memory of your friends all drift out of your mind all that matters is this /none/ moment this dance  these people and the music any semblance of the personality of scanlan that existed before is not  there all you feel is the muscles tensing and relaxing from the everpresent dance the rest of  you slowly begin to approach the outside of this opening  liam she just dumped me out its not my call  matt are you dumping him out or not  laura im afraid because of the musics still playing what if youre still charmed im not  going to dump him out  matt she keeps him in the /none/ necklace  taliesin just the basic features of the area  matt perception check  taliesin come on  liam im in the necklace krumping right now  taliesin that would be ten  matt its hard to tell at this distance theres a lot of the tree line at the edge of it that are  blocking the shape  taliesin vex what did it look like  laura what did what look like  taliesin the area where they are  laura it was a camp with bones all over the ground and floating music things dancing  /none/ taliesin were there tents  laura there werent tents  matt no  taliesin just dirt  laura just bones  taliesin was there a fire pit  laura yes was there a fire pit there was a single fire pit there was a floating violin and a  floating set of drums  taliesin single fire pit lit set of drums violin  travis hey ive got an idea how about you race in grab scanlan ill kill the other two  laura no dont they actually looked really distraught i think they were under a spell as well /none/  travis have you no mercy  taliesin if we can save one we can everybody possibly i havent seen it yet im going  to try and get a little closer to it gently  laura im going to nock an arrow and point it towards the violin and hold it there  matt okay percy you creep closer as you get closer the music gets louder  laura but you have stuff in your ears  taliesin i have packed my ears  matt you have and as you approach it doesnt seem to have an effect on /none/ the volume of the  music  taliesin im backing up  matt all right make an intelligence check add your intelligence modifier  laura please roll good  taliesin natural 20  matt you begin to notice the increasing volume despite the blockage in the ear pretty early on  and stop your advancement before you get too close  taliesin i sit i pull out bad news and i start to get a good look  sam oh god youre going to kill me  taliesin no im just going to cripple you calm down  laura i /none/ feel like we should aim for the instruments  taliesin the instruments are noncorporeal i believe  laura are they  matt theyre just elevated you didnt get a good look at them  taliesin one way to find out im going to take a shot at the violin  matt roll an attack  taliesin i havent done this in so long 17 to hit  matt 17 to hit that hits roll damage  laura what did you aim at  taliesin the violin  laura can i aim at one of the other ones  matt yeah /none/ you want to fire at the same time  laura yeah since he shot i want to shoot  matt which one are you shooting at the drums  laura what else was there  matt there was the drums the flute and the violin  laura drums  matt roll an attack for the drums  liam the woods are full of irishmen  taliesin 12 points of damage  marisha oh shit flogging mollys playing the feywild yo  laura i rolled 16  matt 16 hits so damage  taliesin 12  matt 12 and roll damage /none/  laura 15  matt 15 okay scanlan i need you to roll a wisdom saving throw  sam saving throw not at disadvantage natural 20  matt you guys with your natural 20s okay roll it again  sam natural 20  travis backtoback  laura what the what  matt thats absurd youve been storing this shit after a week weve been gone  marisha i dont think thats happened since we played at home  laura no it happened when i was saving him against the briarwoods two natural 20s  marisha thats right  liam that /none/ was 35 episodes ago  sam wow  matt all right you take 24 points of psychic damage scanlan as both of you guys fire both of  the instruments scatter for a second and there is an echo of psychic energy that resonates  throughout the entirety of that grove the fire shakes and dissipates almost going out scanlan  you can see reach up and grab the sides of his head in pain the guard and the wolf that were  dancing do the same except they both collapse immediately on the ground a moment passes the  /none/ instruments reform the music continues and scanlan goes right back into the dance  sam i throw my white mans overbite back on  laura maybe its time for grog to go in  taliesin no round two  laura round two grog runs in and grabs scanlan and we run out he cant be charmed  travis before you let me off the chain there are trees right whos benefitting from this charm  taliesin the instruments and the campsite  travis theres not somebody in a tree hiding out  taliesin i think the campsite just might be /none/ a campsite i want to try and douse the fire  marisha if you want to rage and go in i can be there on standby  travis youre going to let me go  laura i feel like we should let grog go  marisha i use alter self to shape my fist into a giant rock fist and i deck grog to throw him into  a rage  matt the jaw is momentarily displaced as you pop it back into place  marisha grog go get our bard  travis i would like to rage  matt /none/ you take one damage from the punch impact and you go into a rage running forward at your 50  feet you make it into the center of the camp currently the music is all around you but you  dont hear it because all you see is red and scanlans fucking horrible white mans overbite  dancing by himself at the campsite with no allies  travis i dont know if ive killed an elf in quite a while so im going to aim my axe at the  throat of the elf thats dancing  matt the elf /none/ isnt dancing both he and the werewolf are on the ground unmoving  travis they didnt get back up  matt no theyre fucking down  sam its just me and some instruments now you have to come get me  travis sweet im just grabbing scanlan and running straight through  matt i need you guys to make opposed athletics checks no this would be strength  sam strength or athletics  matt for this one i initially said athletics thats fine theyre almost equatable  sam saving or check  matt check  sam ten  travis 25 /none/  matt 25 you grab scanlan you begin to make your way out of the camp it was 40 or 50 feet to get  in and grab him  taliesin is he starting to make his way out of the camp  matt hes grabbed scanlan and pulled scanlan off his feet  taliesin im going to shoot him in the shoulder with my retort gun  matt okay roll an attack  marisha keep the rage going nice  taliesin ooh just barely 16  matt total of 16 whats your armor class grog  travis 20  /none/ taliesin taking another shot rolling like shit thats better 20  matt whats your armor class  travis 20  matt roll damage  taliesin thank god its been so long where are all my dice just a nick 16 points of damage  matt you take 16 points of piercing damage halved so you take eight you feel the music  begin to creep into your ears as the blood pumping in your skull begins to subside and then  gunshot your shoulder gets blown back you look over and you can see the bullet wound and the  /none/ blood beginning to pour out of the small piercing wound youve suffered in your shoulder the red  takes over once again  travis vax  laughter  matt clutching scanlan at your side you go running out of the field because this is the  secondary round now make one more athletics check versus his athletics check  travis 22  matt yeah scanlans pushing away as hard as he can against your body but you have him footballed  under your arm and go charging out of the center there as you pull out of the center of /none/ the camp  the flames reclaimed its general spiraling height the music keeps playing and then as you  guys rejoin the rest of the party the music begins to fade as the instruments slowly drift  down and lay still  laura good it stopped we can go back out  taliesin cackles really  sam am i okay  matt youre all right now your brain comes to you your legs are a little sore and you were  already exhausted to begin with  sam i instinctually start freaking grog dry hump dancing  travis like a /none/ little dog on my calf  laura okay so youre all right scanlan  sam oh what i was dancing it was amazing there were lights  laura i release my brother hes out of ravens slumber  liam did we see a play yet  laura it was the worst play ive ever seen  taliesin its more of an intermission  laura garmelie why didnt you warn us that could happen  matt garmelie whos there by the side comes out of his invisibility and says i tried i really  tried but you guys continually insist to /none/ go facefirst in whatever i warn you about because  you dont trust me apparently when you hired me to be your guide  laura we trust you dear  matt hopefully youve learned a lesson god sighs  sam wow that was amazing  travis so the fires out instruments are gone should we loot the campfire  laura we should not go back out there  sam can we get those weapons somehow  marisha which weapons  sam the musical weapons  marisha you want the magical enchanted instruments  sam i guess we cant get them /none/ can we  laura best to avoid them  taliesin its a trap its not actually musical instruments  sam well flip a coin right grog  travis yeah thats it roll a d20  sam disadvantage one  laura lets avoid it  marisha were good  matt so what are you guys doing  laura we move towards the dusk  travis were moving towards the gilded run  matt all right as you guys begin moving away garmelie scoots up a little bit and gets a look in  the edge and goes well you certainly found /none/ the happy campsite so good job  travis oh you told us about that earlier  matt yes yes i did  marisha oh thats the happy campsite  taliesin have you not figured that out yet  marisha i thought he was being metaphorical i didnt know it was literal  matt sighs  taliesin this is quite literally the land of literalism at this point  travis we make people sigh a lot  matt all right i need you to roll a survival check with advantage leading the group forward  laura 25  matt 25 all /none/ right you guys continue pushing duskward between you and garmelie leading the  way the forest gets ever thicker the trees get even closer together and you feel that some areas  have no more than maybe three or four feet between the tree trunks themselves the rest is really  angry tangled roots as well as the highgrowing underbrush of the entire forest moon still  unmoving in the sky  travis are we trampling anything as were walking  marisha yeah were not stepping on mandrakes right  matt no in fact its her high rolls that are /none/ keeping you guys from stepping into any of the  local dangerous possibly screaming fauna  sam matt did my countercharm help at all  matt it did  laura it gave us advantage  sam but did you need it  laura no i did yeah  sam hey i did it right  liam halfelves have advantage on charm  laura oh  sam it didnt help  laura it didnt help  matt with anybody else though it wouldve helped it actually helped you  sam i still was charmed  matt you still were charmed  /none/ liam is the footing here precarious i know shes leading us through but is it all viney and  shitty  matt its not great it would slow your pace if you didnt have her leading you through its  still not the fastest pace in the world but youre able to keep going at a decent rate  travis can i jog up to garmelie and vex real fast you said that there were lycans at some  point and you said they move through the trees right  matt yes from what ive heard  travis would that /none/ be these trees  matt possibly  travis right have you seen a lycan  matt i havent  travis great we should be keeping an eye on the trees  laura i was trying to  matt all right make a perception check  laura 36  matt as you guys are having this conversation you glance up right into two yellowish eyes that  are piercing from just past the leaf line of the canopy above you as soon as you look up and see  them they immediately disappear in the darkness and you hear a low /none/ growl and some shifting in the  leaves above you  laura i think theyre here  matt at this point you guys begin to hear surrounding you in the distance growling sounds  of shifting and movement in the trees just beyond you hear in the distance one singular howl and  barks echoing around you in the center of the forest shadows begin to dart between the trees  and a quiet moan of wind begins to break what was once silence in this forest as you guys glance  around you in the darkness many of you /none/ having darkvision even this low moonlight percy you  can still make out the shapes that are shifting you look in your vicinity at what appear to be  about six different medium to larger sized manlike humanoid creatures that step out of the  trees revealing themselves most of which contain a wolflike appearance elongated snout darker  gray and brown furs large pointy ears and gleaming angry eyes the lips curled back  revealing white teeth you see one large tigerlike man which sends you immediately into a  recoiling moment though larger than the rakshasa that youve /none/ experienced and not with the  signature back hands they are unclothed and you see barreling behind you guys heavy footfalls as  you see what looks to be a giant bipedal bear clutching a greataxe comes smash through one of  the tree clearings and roars theyre not attacking theyre not advancing theyve just  surrounded you  sam thats not good  travis well theyre here  liam i give scanlan a little boot in the butt forward a couple of steps  sam hello we come in peace we mean you no harm if weve tread into /none/ your territory we will exit  immediately and we apologize for offending you or your gods  matt some of the wolfmen creatures look at each other the tiger individual steps further out of  the shadows and appears to have two ironlike bracers on a longbow strapped across his back  and steps forward to meet you from beyond the tree that he was partially obscured from intruders  your terrible fate brings you within our domain for what purpose  sam we seek passage through this marshland to what lies beyond it we are searching for  marisha /none/ the shademirk bog  sam the shademirk bog  laura we hope to rid the land of a cancerous tree that has been a blight for a very long time  matt i know not of this tree  sam its a source of great evil thats been corrupting this plane and ours  matt there are many evils that corrupt this plane small tasty thing  sam im not tasty  laura hes not many diseases  taliesin dozens  matt the tiger looks about at the other werewolves who are now stepping in and the bear  whos /none/ put the greataxe over its back now at this point begins to step closer in the tiger whose  eyes are now bent on you takes another step forward so  buzzing  matt the audio on my ipad needs some help apparently time to get new music oh thats an  expenditure i dont need  sam a new ipad for no reason  laura something else its our computer  crew were going to switch out the one that we usually use  sam this is so exciting  matt isnt it though especially at that climactic moment /none/ my audio goes down  crew sorry  matt its all good  laura we should probably kill it i feel bad for everybody listening  matt im going to kill the music then okay bringing us back in now sorry about that  laura maybe just make it come out of your ipad  matt its something sure well go with that  liam works for us  laura thats how we did it at home man  taliesin this is the best simulation of our old home game that ive had  matt thats enough to give you /none/ the feel the tiger takes that step forward leans in to you  and goes to parley or continue our hunt looks at the other wolves call ukurat and roars out  to the air the other wolves all together begin to howl in unison howls loudly into the sky  howls  laura whats trinket doing  matt trinkets backed up with you guys growling and facing off with the bearlike entity thats  keeping eyes on trinket but is still growling up into the air of the forest  travis shit  laura oh ukurat isnt that the /none/ big ghost bear  marisha no that was oralan ukurats the lycan leader  matt a few moments pass as the howling subsides and they all stare intently keeping a bestial  cage around you in the center of this forest its at that point you begin to hear footfalls what  sounds like a series of heavy footfalls at a speed and the sound of trees thrashed as various  hanging vines and branches are snapped or passed at such a speed there is a mass of black shadow  that comes emerging from the brush slamming into the /none/ side of one of the trees near you with a  clattering crash you see it pressed up against the side before leaping off rebounding landing  right beside you guys separating your group giving scanlan vex trinket and garmelie pushed  to one side and the rest of you to the other  you now see this giant feral beast humanoid in shape once it begins to stand but larger than  anything youve seen before as the large wolfman creature stands at full height about 12 13 feet  tall its shoulders wider than yours grog a series /none/ of various jeweled necklaces adorn its  throat and you can see what appears to be a makeshift leather belt and armored leg piece that  sit upon it rings glimmer around its fingers and you can see a series of scars drawn across one  side of its cheek that go down to its throat it looks about at the rest of you separated  glancing at each side so you seek passage yes  sam yes thats right  matt there is a toll to pay a favor to the fendir is granted a favor in kind  /none/ sam a favor to you  marisha the fendir is that what you said  matt we are the fendir  sam well we would be happy to help if we can we are here to do good anyway weve already done  some we conquered the devastating campsite of soradun the happy and were up to doing more  tasks like that if it would help  matt the wolf creature that you expect at this point is the lord ukurat that you heard mentioned  before by both garmelie and the wolf and beast kin leans down towards /none/ you making you  uncomfortable as his head is larger than your entire body scanlan the lips curl back and you  can see the glistening white teeth and drool slowly dripping off the edge of its curled  purpleblack lips sniffs we will not eat this day if you agree to do us this favor  laura name it  matt the pixie wishers carry a madness one that pits them against all who wander these woods they  prey upon us fendir take our forms to desecrate their twisted garden and decorate their lives we  lose family /none/ we the fendir and i lord of this brood ask you to take into this home find these  wishers destroy a relic of their people in particular a circle of crystal stones they keep  it sits among their homes tended by their mystic iotha she wields the power to subjugate us all  do you agree to these terms or does our hunt continue  laura they sound really powerful these pixies  sam if you are not powerful enough to conquer them how would we have a chance  matt if you do not think you have /none/ a chance perhaps youre best suited as our meal for the night  laura no we have a very good chance of defeating them we are quite powerful just wondering why  you havent done it before  matt we have fallen to their magic we are not tested and tempered against such trickster cunning  creatures but if you speak like youve passed the campsite unscathed perhaps you have skills we lack  sam that is true we probably do we made quick work of the camp it was a proud moment for us  one that will be /none/ storied for generations  marisha this mystic iotha you said she has the power to subjugate your kind  matt yes  marisha does she have the power to create more lycans  matt she sees our kind to be exterminated  sam where can we find this site  matt follow the lights  sam the lights  matt the small glittering fey lights that youve seen throughout many of the darker forested areas  of the feywild since you arrived now taking a look they all slowly gently drift in a singular  direction before touching the ground /none/ and dissipating even though the wind that blew  through with their arrival has faded they all still drift in a direction as if theyre being  called a specific way  laura cool hey question should we help you with this terrible problem youve been facing do  you think theres any way you would want to help us when we try to take out this cancerous tree it  needs to be taken care of teamwork  matt cancerous tree  laura its really bad whole other area for you to dominate its quite wonderful  marisha the /none/ shademirk bog  matt make a persuasion check  laura goddamn it wait its my favored terrain  matt doesnt work for every single thing you do the forest isnt going to help you with your  persuasion check sorry  laura natural one  matt the wolf leans forward and the mouth comes right up to you for a second the nose almost  nudges you and you instinctually stand back as it snorts this is not part of our parley we  grant you passage and to take what you wish off their pixie corpses that is the /none/ deal take it or  we hunt  sam i think well take the deal happy to enter into this contract with you no problem  marisha were just stacking contracts  sam is there a timetable to this do we have to do this now can we do this on the way out of the  feywild  matt there is no out until this agreement is completed  sam do we have your word that we have completely safe passage we dont have to worry about any  other sort of monsters getting us in our sleep on /none/ the way there  matt they and us rule this brush against each other nothing will take your path away we can  guide you if need be  marisha if we take out the pixies what is the future of your tribe  matt the brush will be ours we will no longer be taken our people left there to wither and  waste away to the elements  marisha just a question do you guys hunt the pixies because im getting the sense that this is  a weird turf war and i just want to know the /none/ full story before we enter into this contract  matt the bear whos closer to you takes a step forward and you feel the ground shake behind you  travis i match his step  matt match his step okay grog steps forward the other of the wolves nearby see you and they  all snarl crouch down snarling in your direction lord ukurat puts his hands out calm  my brethren we wish to live in peace amongst the woods away from those who would hunt us outside  and in  marisha why dont you guys just agree /none/ you guys take this half of the forest and theyll take the  other i can even help you guys build a big wall if you want not to get oddly political maybe  death is not the answer here  matt one of the wolves nearby speaks up she speaks like she knows this place and you hear  some laughter the wolfs head which is turned to you lord ukurat turns to you  marisha they think im funny  sam how many total are there  matt there were seven including the 12foottall one  sam we /none/ can probably take them  marisha im not trying to take sides here just from a third party looking in trying to  understand both perspectives maybe  matt you have only heard one perspective  marisha exactly  matt then go speak with them if youd like learn what we have learned perhaps that will help  guide your choice  marisha not a bad idea  taliesin i find that very reasonable  laura that is very agreeable  matt we will be watching at this point lord ukurat crouches down leaps up into the canopy of  /none/ the forest and you hear impacts as he leaps off in the distance the other wolves howl follow  suit and dart off in separate directions and you hear as the bear backs away trinket growls back  at him  laura be nice to him trinket  matt bear growl the bear goes grunt trinket goes grunt broseph bear snarls you guys are  left to the quiet of the forest now  sam we could probably kill them all im just throwing that out there  travis im super restless  liam i dont really want to fight /none/ a group of werebeasts but we have much better chances if  were going to pick a side against them with their brute strength than against fucking pixies  i am charmed at the drop of a hat  travis have you fought a werewolf before have you fought a lycan is it just brute strength  liam well they are cursed they seem very unhappy they have to sit in rolling chairs at all times  taliesin we literally have no idea what were up against in any direction  liam there are scary fairy stories though growing up /none/  matt youve heard about people that transform but any specifics about their capabilities  marisha i have a few spells that are good against people who can transform but were also in the  feywild so i dont know  taliesin cute and dainty also means scary and dangerous  liam we really bollocksed up the musical instruments scenario and i dont feel like the  pixies are going to be much better than that  taliesin i feel like that went rather well  laura all things considered  taliesin took less than three tries to figure that /none/ out  liam yeah we ran in for 30 seconds shit the bed and then got the hell out we didnt try to  end them we didnt finish anything  travis it also bears remarking that garmelie said were not supposed to side with either right  laura right garmelie  matt its really up to you guys i dont know if you have much of a choice right now  liam cant we just thread the needle and play them both  marisha until we get out of here were talking about exterminating the group of fairies  /none/ travis no were destroying one of their relics  taliesin just have to desecrate a relic  marisha you dont think theyre going to put up a massive fight if we go in and start kicking their relics  taliesin i feel like weve desecrated relics before  laura scanlan is really charming  sam i could probably convince them to destroy it themselves  taliesin hows that book going  marisha you genuinely think we can destroy the relics without harming anyone  laura no but id like to try  taliesin but i also will admit i kind /none/ of want to see the pixies  marisha i want to see the pixies too  liam you also wanted to hear the music that didnt go well weve got a bow to get you  travis lets just go over there do a little recon and then well make up our minds  liam we are idiots  taliesin yes we are  sam im more inclined to turn around and fight these lions and tigers and bears oh my because  pixies who knows  laura honestly they didnt seem that bad i feel terrible killing them for /none/ no reason  marisha maybe we can talk to the pixies about  taliesin i think you would look fetching in a new lined winter jacket  marisha maybe they can work with us  sam im okay with at least going to do some recon  travis go see the pixies we send in garmelie if he dies then we make a choice do you have a  revision to that plan  matt i would think that would be the last portion of the plan everything else goes forward  and then all else fails perhaps garmelie would /none/ have a hard time  marisha garmelie go percy  taliesin youre our guide guide us were supposed to go where were going so youre  supposed to get us there how do we get there  laura follow the lights  matt you know exactly how to go there follow the lights  travis wow youre so brave  marisha we brought you here  taliesin garmelie im so curious as to what happens if youre going to renege on our  contract  laura would you want to draw some of the pixies if we see them  /none/ matt if they let me  laura you can hide behind grog and you draw the pixies  matt i can maybe do that  travis theyre going to be pixies with giant dickbutts everywhere  marisha garmelie is there anything in particular about pixies we desperately need to be aware of  matt theyre tiny theyre frail mostly mischievous  travis how tiny  matt he makes a motion with his hands about like that  laura theyre really that small are they super strong  matt no theyre quite the opposite actually  sam but there are lots /none/ of them and theyre fast and invisible  matt they are fairly magical entities depending on which type of pixie they are their  dispositions can shift dramatically the feywild entities that live and exist in certain areas tend  to adapt to those areas there are creatures of all emotional and moral backgrounds and interests  its hard to say  taliesin ill also say if we are going to attack the werecreatures it would be nice to have a  little help maybe  sam help from whom  taliesin from the pixies if we explain our situation /none/ we can make a decision and either help  the werecreatures or  laura maybe the pixies can help us take out the cancerous tree and all the things around it  travis well lets go get eyes on them shall we  marisha lets go  matt all right make a survival check with advantage because youre in a forest  laura im in a forest  sam oh just her  matt just her yeah  laura thats better 22  matt 22 you guys begin to move slowly forward as you ascertain a direction from the occasional /none/  small flutter of fey light that drifts at a slight curvature in its descent making your way in the  direction where supposedly the nexus of this pixie tribe should exist  were going to go ahead and take a break we will see you guys back here in a few minutes to pick up  where we left off wandering towards the pixie home well see you guys in a minute  break  matt welcome back as we come into the event vox machina is slowly crawling through the moonbrush  towards wherever these gentle fey lights /none/ drift leading them hopefully to some sort of home  space or residence of the local wishers pixie population you guys pushing on for about another  two and half three hours following the lights  sam reading  laura how many hours do you have left of reading  sam after two and half more i have about four and a half  matt so close youre on the cusp of your week end too you guys make your way hoping that the  music now is fixed we shall see its a cable issue not an ipad issue /none/ it looks like as you  guys push on you eventually see a cluster of small glowing lights in the distance vex  garmelie immediately goes im going to hide now and he goes invisible  laura garmelie wont they see you  matt thats possible should i just stay back  laura you should probably just hold onto grog if he runs in just trail behind him  matt okay and you feel the little hand grab the back of your belt again a similar situation  you hear groans  you guys now see what appears to be /none/ a thicket in the center of this portion of the forest maybe 20  or so naturallooking homes forming a small glowing community almost like they were grown out  of the ground of the local trees the bark itself protrudes from the side of a tree and creates a  domelike abode that has carved little windows in it and a glowing interior its a very pretty  fairy community out there right in there in the center all of the fey lights in the forest are  slowly drifting in towards the center of this community at a /none/ hundredfoot distance you can  just make out the faintest details  laura theyre teeny though its teeny little houses  matt yes  sam like doghouse size  matt each home or abode is about the size of a basketball  sam are they made out of toadstools  matt its hard to see from this distance you can just see the general size of the homes  marisha this is so cute  liam and vex is the only one that can see it  matt shes the furthest ahead yes  travis i feel like cute is /none/ the last word we should use for this  taliesin it will be the last word you ever say  laura definitely pixie city is up ahead  travis should we look for perimeter alarms or traps  laura yes i look for that good idea grog good thinking  liam im going to go stealth just because  laura me too  matt all right make a stealth check guys  travis all right pass without a trace  laura thats not still active anymore  travis that was awful  sam were doing stealth checks  matt of /none/ those who wish to move forward towards the village  marisha oh all of us sure  travis 15  taliesin natural 20  travis what  liam 25  sam are we adding plus ten  laura 27  sam five  marisha 17  matt and as you guys creep forward still humming the essence of the tune you guys managed to escape  earlier scanlans enjoying the echoes of his countercharm that he so well presented earlier  you shush him as you slowly creep closer to the outskirts of this pixie community as you get  /none/ closer when you envision a city or a cluster of abodes like this its a large section but for  the scale of this its no more than maybe 25 feet across and there are maybe two dozen homes  throughout the entirety of this space you can see just on the edge looking inside what appears to  be a circle of about ten slightly glowing quartzlike stones arranged in a perfect circle  in the center of the community and most of the fey lights are drawn towards it and cluster and  rest at the base of /none/ the stones before fading away  you can also see throughout this community arranged like decorative statues three stone  humansized wolfmen type creatures that are locked in place their claws up like this some  look like theyre fleeing over a shoulder theyre all locked in a stone position and  currently now have draped over them small vines and flowers and they now rest amongst the  community as some sort of a landmark  liam all right that is kind of fucked up  sam yeah  matt you can see at this distance now a few /none/ moving slightly brighter points of glowing light  fluttering by and going from one little home to another one over and into the circle flutters  back you guys are still at a good 40 50 feet from the outside of this clearing  laura and we cant spot any pixies near us at all  matt not directly near you no  travis i hate spiders  sam i dont want to go near this place we should either talk to them or run away right now  travis i like the latter of those two  liam what /none/ was the goal here to grab part of the circle  sam to break a piece of the circle  marisha to kick over their rocks  travis did they say to bring one back or to break it the relic  matt they said desecrate  marisha they said it was the source of their power right  liam desecrate it  travis you ever stepped on an anthill right it gets real nasty real fast  liam is it an open area over the village  matt it is a clearing of trees about 25 30 feet across /none/ and along the interior of the trees are  where a lot of the homes are grown out of or out of the ground almost like strange tree trunk roots  up into a domelike natural home and even theyre arranged in a smaller circle around the  central stone circle that is the middle  travis like forest wasps  liam it all depends on the definition of desecrate i could fly you 500 feet in the air  and you could shit upon that circle it just depends if that is desecration in the eyes of the fey /none/  taliesin i will say that from what i gather of this realm it probably isnt enough  travis what if we asteroiddropped keyleth from 500 feet  marisha that was very fun  laura that would take out the lot of them  marisha but it would take out the lot of them right  laura it seems so drastic  liam the fairies or the fairy circle wouldnt it just destroy the circle  marisha how wide is the entire  matt about 25 30 feet for the entirety of the community the circle itself is five to /none/ ten feet  wide its not a very large circle at all  travis youd be in your stone elemental form itd be no problem for you  marisha itd be no problem for me  sam i dont think she would ever get close to it they have some sort of shield up  taliesin itd be kicking the hornets nest certainly  sam tell me this vex vax people with high perception  laura hes vex im vax  sam where are the animal men are they watching us right now  matt perception check  laura thats /none/ double because of favored terrain what is that 20 no 33  matt 33 doing a pretty intense scan of the vicinity of the forest around you you see no sign  of any of the previous pack that you encountered  sam i think theyre out there somewhere  taliesin i think theyre probably hanging back a bit i dont know if theyd want to get this close  marisha im sure they have other means of spying on us  travis i vote we dont fuck with the pixies never thought id say that  marisha heres what /none/ i have at my disposal a i can shapeshift into a little tiny spider and go in there  laura can you shapeshift into a pixie  marisha no unfortunately beasts particular  sam cant you go underground and pop up  marisha yeah once again probably destroying their entire village but yeah  taliesin the two of us could snipe something out  marisha but i could go in like a spider and be a spider i also happened to bring hallucinatory  terrain today so depending on how smart we think the lycans are maybe i can make /none/ it look like we  destroyed it  liam how long does that last  marisha 24 hours let me double check before i make promises  laura i like this  liam just to give us a days head start  sam what we could do grog and i could run back i could cut him over the eye and say it was  horrible it was quite a fight but we won  laura do we need to let the pixies know that were going to do this  marisha maybe scanlan do you have something that could /none/ i dont want to waste a spell and then  find out that they have some sort of magical barrier enchantment that it cant stay up there  travis what youd waste hallucinatory terrain  marisha yeah  travis when else are you going to use that  marisha well im burning a spell slot  sam if they block it with their magical little crystals all over the place then theyll also  know were here and they will attack us  marisha yes 24 hours for a 150foot cube i make a terrain look sound and smell like /none/ some sort of  other terrain  laura im just worried that if you do it then the lycans are going to bust it and then they just go  to battle amongst themselves  taliesin isnt that brilliant  laura this is actually really smart  sam wait can you still treebamf us out of harms way if we needed to  laura youve got the mansion  sam i dont have the mansion  taliesin hes already burned the mansion  sam i havent slept in days  marisha the only thing i have that can get us /none/ out fast is plane shift which will get us out of the  feywild but i brought that just in case  travis third option we say fuck the lycans fuck the pixies and we just keep going  laura what if you do the hallucinatory terrain and we just leave  marisha yeah we could do the hallucinatory terrain and if it fails then i guess we wont be  in any worse situation  taliesin im a big fan of hallucinatory terrain  sam if we do hallucinatory terrain and it fails the pixies will straightup attack us /none/  laura how do you know  marisha well it wont hurt them it just makes it look different  sam everything here has attacked us  travis all in favor of hallucinatory terrain raise your hand  sam we have to get the animal men here to see it or else it isnt worth it  laura we cast it and we create a ruckus  sam i will buy into this idea if we have a plan for when the pixies are about to literally attack  us five minutes from now  marisha well we can do /none/ hallucinatory terrain and if we run into the lycans all we have to do  is say we did it  laura do hallucinatory terrain garmelie which direction should we run if were running towards  where were supposed to be going  matt garmelie has watched this thing with eyes wide and hes like that way  laura all right  travis werent you dropping little green rocks  marisha i was dropping little green rocks  travis so we can find our way back to the lycans right  marisha yeah  taliesin thats of course assuming that /none/ the little green rocks work here  marisha they were red they were red rocks  taliesin theres an awful lot of reasons why the little red rocks wouldnt work  travis okay lets do it  laura we take off running  sam wait where are we running  laura towards the bog  sam towards the what  liam we think towards the bog  sam were leaving kiki and just running  marisha no i can do this at a range of 300 feet so lets back up 300 feet  laura you do it we act /none/ like we did something we start running  marisha hallucinatory terrain are we doing this are we ready are we doing this i did it bamf  matt so you stand back a bit at the outskirts what kind of hallucinatory terrain are you  creating  marisha i want it to look like the fairy terrain but their little huts are on fire like theyve  been raided and i want the circle of rocks to be obliterated and all their statues to be knocked  over and it smells like fire and shit and pixie blood like grog /none/ said  matt grasping at what you imagine pixie blood would smell like  marisha yeah im sure it smells delightful herbal  matt so as keyleth you finish concentrating you guys watch as theres a shimmer of magical energy  and now you see where once the beautiful glowing fairy light of the pixie abodes now look burnt to  a cinder you can see embers slowly rising off of them as the stone structures are now broken across  the ground  liam the horror the horror  sam the pixies see it too though  marisha they /none/ can see it but they can also be like oh this isnt real  liam i grab keyleth by the wrist and start running away from the village  travis are we running back to the lycans or to the shademirk  laura towards the shademirk  travis ive got garmelie  liam go run faun run  laura but keep on the lookout for mandrakes  marisha and werewolves  matt okay so i want everyone to make a perception check  sam strong eight  taliesin natural one  liam natural one  taliesin no  marisha 22 /none/  laura no 31  travis natural 19  matt what are you looking out for which direction are you looking  laura im looking towards where were going  matt okay so youre going with garmelie heading in the direction duskward where are you looking  keyleth  marisha im looking out for werewolves for lycans  matt okay where are you looking  travis im looking for lycans too im just being honest  matt all right so you guys continue pushing forward  liam im shouting the way is clear  matt all right you guys run /none/ and run and run and youre pushing through brush and pushing over  elements and heavy hard portions of the floor i need everyone to roll this is going to be an  athletics check for the keeping up the endurance and the speed this is not easy terrain you  continue to push through  marisha athletics  laura ive got land stride so i dont get slowed by any hard terrain  matt youre fine you dont need to roll  travis 24  marisha 24  taliesin 11  sam i rolled twice because of disadvantage both /none/ were ones  matt youve hit the spectrum today  liam well i rolled a one but then i used luck and i rolled a 20  matt you guys calm down on the extremes there are other numbers between those two you realize  on the dice  sam im tired from reading  matt youre not reading during this run but as you guys are charging forward scanlan goes  facefirst over a heavy root into the ground you guys have to double back grab him keep going  you push on and you push on and you /none/ push on for what seems like another 30 minutes to an hour  your pace starts to slow due to general exhaustion and youre unable to keep that speed and that  level of physical exertion for that long most of you cant grog is happy to go forever  constitution of 20 hes good to go  liam hes basically good against anything except one of the ancient dragons  matt theres a few things hes not good against tiny brain with arms and legs not so good  travis fuck that little bastard  matt that was fun /none/ eventually you begin to see a thinning of the trees like the forest is coming  to an end youre beginning to hit the edge of the duskward side of the moonbrush  laura are we going the right direction garmelie  matt as far as i know yes were going the right way  marisha youre taking us through the bog  matt through the moonbrush thats what were going through  marisha still to the bog  matt of course where else would i want to go hes holding his hat and rushing along  liam you want /none/ to go to the theater  matt no theater  liam whats your problem with the arts man  matt you guys at this point in time come to the final tree line vex and vax and garmelie helming  at the front of the pace before all three of you slam into something extremely hard  marisha oh fuck  laura what is it  liam did it feel like a theater  matt no it felt like a wall  liam the wall of a theater  laura seriously a wall  matt you stand back up and /none/ you guys catch up and same thing you come up to the edge between where  the trees that hit the perimeter of the forest are and theres a barrier an invisible barrier  right there thats preventing you from crossing  liam what is this thing garmelie  matt i dont know i havent encountered this  liam never ever  matt i dont walk into the middle of dangerous forests for fun  taliesin i dont think we can leave until we take care of this  travis wait you can go invisible is it magic can you /none/ tell  matt i can have a look at it  travis yeah have a look  matt he comes up and looks over it for a bit to be honest this is a largescale enchantment this  is some sort of this is very powerful very old magic  marisha fucking old magic  matt he turns around looking at you guys hi  laura hi  matt looking past you  laura oh shit  matt as you guys turn around and see behind you what looks to be shoulder to shoulder a mass of  furred standing /none/ snarling beastlike humanoids behind them landing and standing up to his full  height his snout having to dip beneath the brush under the nearest trees  liam see what we did to those pixies wrecked  laura fucking destroyed  travis cut me real quick  matt at this point you now see as lord ukurat steps from them and they all begin to form a  semicircle around you he goes were you trying to flee  taliesin we were running from the pixies  laura we destroyed their home and then we took off running thats what /none/ you wanted right  marisha theyre so scary  matt if you had done what we asked you would have been able to leave this forest  taliesin so we have to try harder it didnt work  laura apparently our methods were not complete we will go back and we will do it better this next time  marisha to be fair i dont remember entering a formal contract  liam you took off before we shook hands or anything  marisha you told us to go take a look at the pixies first and to get a second /none/ opinion and we  have made it to the edge of the bog safely without your need of safe passage  matt hes already turned around and walking away he says do what you will i have no interest in  you liars deceivers you talk too much your meat would taste like ash in my mouth well good  luck enjoy your time locked in this prison like the rest of us the wolves turn around and walk away  laura wait youre locked in here because of the pixies  taliesin i feel like theyre terrible communicators  /none/ marisha yeah they shouldve told us that i dont think they wanted to tell us that  liam wouldve been a good incentive for us to destroy the pixies we cant proceed without  destroying the pixies  laura a little communication is all we need  travis can i take out my bloodaxe and go up to the magic barrier and hit it as hard as i can  matt go for it roll an attack  taliesin this is going to be appalling dont  travis 22  matt okay roll damage  travis how do i do /none/ that i forget im kidding  matt its been a few episodes  travis 16  matt okay i need you to also make a wisdom saving throw  travis sweet natural one  marisha oh my god  liam got to love it when the crew laughs at your final death crack  matt as you pull back with the bloodaxe you slam with all your might into the barrier as it  hits theres a streak a flash of vibrant bluishwhite light and what sounds like the  highest shriek youve ever heard in the entirety of your /none/ time on exandria at which point you watch  grog get flung backwards at incredible speed through the air the actual blast sending you  almost into your allies and party slamming into one of the nearby tree trunks the bloodaxe goes  plopping to the ground as you feel a number of bones in your back crack from the impact you  suffer 28 points of psychic damage and 14 points of bludgeoning damage from hitting the tree  taliesin i feel like we all learned a very valuable lesson right now  marisha whats a good burrowing creature /none/ a badger  travis ow  laura i feel like we need to rest you guys we really need to rest  taliesin lets sit down and camp and in the morning well go and kill some pixies  sam wait are we trapped in here because we were deceitful to these wolfmen or because the pixies  are trapping everybody  liam the pixies are bitter little assholes  matt garmelie goes that doesnt make sense people enter and exit the forest without an issue  sam we entered  marisha yeah we entered  sam so why are /none/ we trapped here because we lied  matt i dont know  travis i just dont think we can go this way belches  taliesin im going to attempt to cast minor illusion on the other side of the wall just an  image of myself  matt okay as you attempt to cast the spell the arcane energy dissipates upon impact with the  barrier  laura garmelie who do you know thats left these woods  matt that would be my uncle jameson whos the person i learned most of this information about  the moonbrush from  /none/ laura your uncle jameson and he was definitely telling the truth that he went in the woods  matt he was probably a little intoxicated when he was spinning these tales but  taliesin is jameson his real name or a nickname  matt as far as i know its his real name  laura so he knew about the happy camp  matt these were the things i was warned of yes  liam do we want to waste any time trying to take your broom up and see how high this barrier goes  marisha i can dig /none/ and see if we can go under just in case  taliesin that doesnt jive  travis oh thats true it didnt hurt us when we just ran into it  liam no when we ran into it it felt like a brick wall  laura i guess i fly up can i fly up and see how high up it goes  matt sure you get on the broom you go past the canopy and eventually the front of the broom  clips and scrapes against and you can see a little bit of a shimmer of the barrier /none/ that domes up  laura its a bubble were in a bubble i go back down  travis i have a proposal  laura yes grog  travis why dont we make our way back to the pixie dome and say oh we were chased by these  horrible lycans we wanted to kill them but we got stuck when we hit this invisible wall could  you do anything to help us get rid of the lycans and then we play both sides of the coin  sam that is way better than our first idea and yet still /none/ terrible  taliesin i think we have to pick a terrible idea and stick with it until it becomes far too much  for us to deal with  marisha can i take a look around and do a perception check to see if anyone else might be  watching us  matt make a perception check  marisha thats not bad 25  matt 25 you take a moment and glance about the tree line the floor  marisha are there rustles in the bushes from someone who might be invisible  matt no movement any further once the /none/ rest of lord ukurat and his crew had vanished into the  nightward direction youve seen no movement since  laura i feel like they werent that bad of guys they couldve attacked us and they didnt they  just want out  liam theyre certainly no meaner than grog is theyre just scarier  taliesin i propose we take a nap go back and deal with the pixies one way or another  liam i agree with percival i think all our options are shit we pick the least shitty and see  what happens  laura scanlan can /none/ you sleep  sam if i read for a few more hours first sure  taliesin youll take first watch  marisha how long have we been up  matt at this point in time id say close to eight nine hours  marisha so it hasnt been a full day lets call it an early night  laura read your book well sleep  travis all right you take first watch were going to zonk out  sam okay  laura ill stay up as well  matt so youre taking a short rest or a long rest  /none/ laura well take a short rest into a long rest so he can finish reading and then we can sleep  matt all right sure so youre taking first watch  laura and im up with him  matt okay  marisha can i  matt can you  marisha i want to go minxie and do a little perimeter walk in the forest a little bit  matt okay the rest of you guys are resting and finding camp here in a small section of the trees  youre on that weird cusp where looking out towards the barrier /dung/ you can see the dusk light  the usual sky of the feywild and as you guys back up to find your camp a little deeper in the  forest where it feels safer and less exposed looking up you can still see the dark starry sky  and the moon both visible from your position past the trees above and past the barrier in front  as the rest of you are resting youre finishing up your reading you go minxie form and you go  wandering the perimeter make a perception check  marisha natural one  sam /none/ looks like a seven nope thats a one  matt as youre stalking through looking about you catch a scent a new scent one youre  unfamiliar with it smells sweet like a freshly fallen and opened fruit you immediately  instinctively look down and sniff across the ground out of the corner of your eye you see a  glow as you see two small humanoid entities with pairs of wings flutter in in front of you and  stop what languages do you know  marisha elven sylvan primordial  matt okay you do understand what theyre saying /none/ as they are both talking to each other in sylvan  one says im not familiar with this one i dont think ive seen this creature in here before  the other one glances over and goes you dont think she couldve done it  marisha what was that last bit sorry  matt you dont think that she couldve done it its just a cat  is it though they both get closer and inspect you theyre both rotating around your face and  fluttering one starts pulling on your ear a little bit tugging on it  marisha /none/ i start purring  matt its okay they move underneath under your neck and scratch just a little bit  the other one backs up and goes we have to keep looking something did this  marisha i wait for a second and then start stalking them  matt you follow them  marisha yeah  matt okay the rest of you guys are taking a rest you continue reading  laura im awake im keeping guard  matt they stop and move stop and move theyre doing a full perimeter apparently they are some  sort of a search /none/ party occasionally you can hear bits and pieces of conversation at a distance  thanks to your better hearing as minxie but not incredible bits theyre discussing a scare  theyre discussing the enchantment that was placed theyre discussing new intrusion thats  about the most you can make out of the conversation you continue to follow them youre  going into the second or third hour of following them and theyre  still doing a wide perimeter in the forest  they meet up with a third  one and they have a quick little discussion and then branch /none/ off  marisha can i hear the little discussion anything  matt if you want to get closer  marisha yeah  matt okay make a stealth check  marisha i have stealth as minxie i get benefits right as a tiger oh yeah i do oh not good ten  matt all right as you creep forward in the middle of their discussion the three of them all  whip around at you one of them pulls a wand out and puts it out in front and the other two back up  marisha i just start eating grass /none/  laura thats totally tigerlike  matt the two that saw you before are like shes been following us  why  marisha i roll over and show my belly  matt the one that has the wand out goes i dont want to take chances puts the wand out how many  hit points do you have in minxie form  liam shuffle shuffle flip page flip page flip page  marisha sorry 52 theyre going to finger of death me arent they theyre going to do  something bad  matt okay raises the wand theres a slight /none/ tingling sensation and then nothing happens and  looks at the wand strange they all convene and start whispering to each other very close  marisha i look distracted with other stuff i sniff and wander off  matt they separate a bit  marisha just doing catlike things  liam just start pissing  marisha i mark my territory i spray a little bit  laura gross thats foul keyleth  matt you hear one of them say we can always correct it later but best to be safe than sorry  as youre peeing i need you to /none/ make a  laura if she gets petrified while shes pissing its going to be  matt i need you to make a constitution saving throw  sam its either a one or a 20  marisha ill just start a new one dont worry about it fuck why  travis

youre peeing you feel another warm tingle over one shoulder and you  feel your muscles tense a little bit and then relax as the effect passes over you to no effect  the three pixies go we have to tell her i dont trust it and they all flutter off  marisha okay i head back to camp  matt a few /none/ hours pass keyleth hasnt returned youre still reading  laura keyleth keyleth dear shit  marisha

home  liam i take off flying  laura fucking a  marisha oh jesus oh man im a big girl come on  laura that is not what i meant for you to do  matt this /none/ is your first time really trying out your wings youre also in a very dense forest so  theres no space as you heroically take off you impact your wing hits a branch and you go  spinning out of the way  liam can i spiderman from tree to tree like the werewolves did using the wings a little bit  matt youre trying to make an acrobatics check with disadvantage  travis its like a plinko machine  liam 28  matt with disadvantage you manage to not fall on your face but it is a very clumsylooking /none/ ascent  you make it but a wingspan of that size amongst treetops is going to do very little other than  what your general leaping would do you get a little bit of gliding space from point to point  liam im still fucking asleep is the problem  matt yeah but you dont fall all right so well say for the next couple hours you guys  dosido in the forest until eventually you do convene your wings wear off and you find  yourself back at the camp minxie safely arriving just as you finish your final /none/ page of your book  sam and it was all a dream what a shitty ending who knew it was terribly hacky and derivative  and it read like fifty shades of grey  laura scanlan you  sam what something different about me  laura i dont know did you do your hair differently today  liam are you shorter  sam i feel so interesting  liam thats impossible  sam it could be  matt and scanlan goes right into the deepest slumber hes ever experienced  laura good you guys are back everybodys safe everythings good /none/  marisha so i stalked a couple of fairies for several hours  liam i know all this she told me two hours ago  marisha yes i caught him up a little bit as we were walking back pretty sure it is the fairies  who are creating the magical barrier and im pretty sure its because we mightve scared the  living shit out of them so it mightve all been still our fault all along like most things are  so well talk to the fairies tomorrow  laura if they dont find us  marisha they /none/ are actively looking for us  travis they saw you  marisha they saw me as a cat  travis what did they do to you  marisha i think they tried to cast several spells on me and by some luck of the draw i managed to  feline my way out of them i think they are looking for me and us and i wont be a tiger  anymore  laura can i use my ranger abilities and try to disguise where were camping  marisha can i help hide ill help her a little bit  /none/ matt you guys find a little alcove by one of the bigger trees nearby that has some of the roots  recess inward and you build a small camp there thats covered with thatch and branches  liam do we have any concept of what time it is in this perpetual night  matt you really have none  laura im going to get a little sleep though so i can get my spells back anybody else taking  watch  liam yeah stay up with me  marisha okay  taliesin she needs to rest  travis ill stay /none/ up  matt shes already been up for four hours  liam stay up with me  travis you can cuddle with me  liam dont offer that  travis i know  marisha okay i will sleep then i guess  matt go ahead and nap you guys are staying up  marisha i pick a space near vax  matt you guys make perception checks both of you  travis ten  liam 27  matt okay partway into your watch you do see whereas there was the very faint everpresent  falling of the fey lights you /none/ do see what looks to be two brighter lights that are traveling  together shifting about a little ways past your sight  liam do you see that  travis yeah fireflies  liam no well sort of lets watch them i dont think we should go out i think we should let the  group rest  travis what the little lights  liam no your friends well let them sleep unless those things come closer  travis oh  liam are they coming closer or are they keeping their distance  matt theyre keeping a distance they dont /none/ seem to notice you  laura they mightve heard you  matt all right they come pretty close actually they start heading in your direction do you guys  do anything are you going to stay quiet what do you do  liam dont move i go stealth  travis i freeze in an exotic pose  matt make a stealth check with advantage because of the camouflage that she put  liam do i have that camouflage  matt you already have your crazy bonuses but yeah take advantage on that  liam 25  travis eight  matt /none/ total of eight with advantage  travis a six and a two  liam come on grog come on  matt all right as they drift past you hear a fart which isnt what catches their attention  its the pause after and grog uncontrollably laughing at it partially because the intent of  keyleth staying close to vax while you guys were resting and it went in her direction  marisha i shuffle uncomfortably in my sleep i dont know why i just had a nightmare  matt you watch as two of these fluttering points of light about /none/ ten feet out  liam im staying still  matt stay there for a second and then go darting off into the distance  travis one look and they ran  liam we have to talk about your diet  travis what  liam your diet do you eat any greens at all  travis yeah pickled herring and ive been grabbing stuff as we walk through  marisha that just happened he wants to talk about your ibs and there are lycans  liam i crawl over to my sister and shake her and say wake up  laura /none/ what  liam dont fly away like i did oh wait your brooms over there all right they are watching  us they came in close and then they left so i dont think were safe anymore  laura so we fucking should get out of here  liam maybe yeah  laura wake everybody up  travis no look weve got to talk to them anyway right were not going to run  laura at least we can prepare ourselves  travis how  taliesin sleeping  travis yeah just keep sleeping  laura i wake percival up  /none/ travis no  laura percy  taliesin what yes  laura hi grumpy  taliesin what  laura weve been discovered by fairies  taliesin thats nice  laura get ready to use your charming wiles  taliesin all right  laura im going to let scanlan sleep a little bit more because he looks fucking exhausted  liam thats it you put him back to sleep you go back to bed then  laura all right fine can we make things look fancy around here so when they all come back we  look like were ready to talk /none/ to them  taliesin i slowly crawl out i pull out a piece of parchment and i write hello fairies were  napping and i put it on the tree above us and go back to sleep  liam youre letting whitey go back to sleep then  laura whitey are you calling him whitey as a nickname  liam yeah i think its apt fuck it i go back to bed i spoon keyleth and fall asleep  marisha ill allow it  travis i actually go back to sleep too  laura what in the fuck is going /none/ on here how is this happening  matt vex youre the only one awake  taliesin all right fine my watch ill get up  laura im going to sit up  taliesin i sit up and take the watch  laura oh you know what im going to put out the little gold tea set and im going to act like  were welcoming them to tea whenever they show up  taliesin i will take the watch and i will make some tea with the tea set  travis the cups are bigger than they are oh you /none/ made drowning pots for us all how lovely its  going to be a threat  laura i never did actually find out what this tea set does  taliesin were about to find out then arent we  laura oh you know what and i take out my old wooden music box that i discovered  liam yes pull out all of your cursed items  laura and i wind it up and make some pretty music  sam like a crazy grandma in the woods  taliesin i am joining you for this ridiculous tea party  laura /none/ i like it thank you dont drink out of the teacups because i really think they might be  cursed seriously percy i know its appealing to you but dont get cursed again all right  matt all right so you guys prepare your tea you set up your music box a couple more hours  pass the rest of you coming to a semblance of a restful sleep the only ones who didnt get a  restful sleep on this would be vex and percy  taliesin i specifically did not join those conversations  matt you barely got /none/ in there you do not get your spells back unfortunately scanlan you reduce  your exhaustion by one point  sam oh i got sleep  matt you did yes so youre down to only one point which means your speed is no longer  halved  sam oh i had two points of exhaustion i thought it was just one  matt you wanted to keep reading  liam hair is shiny eyes are bright  taliesin your charismas up by two which means  sam no i already did it  matt at this point towards the end /none/ of this watch here you see as a cluster of seven lights now  start swarming in your direction  laura oh good  marisha are we awake  matt youre starting to come to as vex begins to nudge you guys to consciousness  sam do i get spells back  matt you do  laura oi scanlan sing a happy tune about how much we love fairies  sam oh sure i love singing happy tunes about fairies  laura yeah like how pretty they are  sam how about i just sing a happy tune  laura /none/ sounds good too  sam ill sing a song about myself the best kind of songs singing cube glorious cube you  really should try it if youre in the mood i wont even hide it ill pull down my trousers for  any gal or dude o cube glorious cube wonderful cube magical cube  matt the sounds of your voice accompanied by the music box playing through the air as the wisher  pixies arrive at least this troupe of them come rushing up you see they are all behind one that  appears to have while all /none/ of them have a slight white with a hint of pinkish glow there is one  that has a deeper purple halo around it as they all approach they stop and the purple one goes  up to the paper that was left on the tree so enjoy your nap  laura i wasnt quite rested but it was lovely here  taliesin there is tea would you like some tea  sam we might have straws  taliesin i am tempted to fashion the thing that i use to pour my molds into little sippy cups that  can /none/ be shared  laura weve been trying to prepare for your coming unfortunately we dont have very much to  make it appropriate  taliesin we are aware we need to have a conversation good morning  matt yes we do and the other pixies flutter down to the ground she flutters down as well  and they approach the tea set  marisha i say good morning to them in sylvan  matt they all look over and they give a slight curtsey bow you now have a closer look at them  theyre all various lithe young men /none/ and women with little leafbased or vinebased bits of attire  the one that has the purplish halo is an older one with whiter hair thats a little wild around the  face you can see the wings themselves look a little more tattered and worn shes probably the  respected elder of the troupe thats there as they all step forward she inspects the tea set and  looks up so  laura im afraid theres been a misunderstanding you see we were trying to pass through these  woods and we ran into a band of very big /none/ very meanlooking wolves  matt all the pixies at once go gasps and they pull back the purple one says you ran into them  sam not only did we run into them but they forced us against our will to attempt to do you  harm  laura which of course we didnt want to do  taliesin so we thought we would just trick them  matt the pixies at this point are darting around to each of you you each have a pixie hovering  right in front of you quickly inspecting your bodies you can see /none/ now the central one the  glowing purple is in the air backing up  marisha they didnt bite any of us or get any of us were not infected  matt they all look around you see the pixies all turn back looking okay one of them by grog  turns and goes hes been wounded pointing at his head  laura his cut  taliesin oh that was him  sam i cut his eyebrow and then he fucked himself by trying to smash through the barrier that i  assume you created  travis yeah dont go /none/ through that wall but bidet  taliesin were on a mission though  laura a great mission  matt if we are to continue this conversation we need comfort he is disquieting allow us  laura what are you going to  travis no its cool please do as you will  liam what are we talking about  travis let them feel at ease go ahead  matt the older one glances over at you make a constitution saving throw  travis natural one laughs  matt as you grin you watch as his flesh goes an even duller /none/ gray color as his entire body turns to  solid stone  liam is that temporary is that going to last  matt now let us have a conversation  laura okay  matt so youve encountered these beasts  laura yes  marisha and they instructed us to kill you  taliesin no not to kill  laura they wanted us to hurt you to destroy your circle of stones  matt they sent you to come and kill us and destroy our home  liam we misspoke to destroy this circle  matt you speak in many words /none/ that do not meet as one thought or theory  taliesin well youre a bit intimidating  matt as the very tiny pixies all look at each other and look at you large folk theres a little  chuckle under their breath  taliesin we are wise enough to not judge a man or woman by their size good sir  marisha we didnt want to harm you so we thought if we just made it look to those silly dumb  lycans like we hurt you by throwing paper balls if you will  taliesin stop antagonizing the grog /none/ statue  marisha i did just a simple visual spell and we tried to move on as to not get involved  sam we did everything in our power to protect you and to not harm you if our druids  spellcasting frightened you we apologize but we didnt know what else to do  taliesin and we have a bog to destroy  laura yes were on a very important mission and we thought it might be the quickest way to  complete  taliesin theres a cancerous tree that we have been sent to destroy  liam honestly /none/ were scared of both you and the lycan and we just want to pass through we want  no harm for you and unfortunately them either we just want to walk on out of here  marisha this is not our fight you see  matt the older one is glancing about and a couple of the pixies drop next to her and whisper  into her ear and her eyes are still darting amongst you  marisha can i understand what theyre saying  matt no theyre very small and theyre very distant  laura thats really really offputting /none/  matt its impressive the two pixies separate the elder one crosses her fingers few are those  who would deal with such miscreants and foul entities as those wolf kin so much as to give our  little hearts a possible scare of death to our homes in an attempt to escape without but a  conversation this puts us at unease we do not like being at unease  laura understandable but we werent trying to deal with them in fact we made no deal with  them we told them we wouldnt make a deal until we /none/ spoke with you but we were scared we were too  scared  marisha they were trying to exploit our abilities we were being held against our will we  were threatened with life or death there was nothing personal  liam their leader is massive we were scared this one wet his leg and hes gigantic we just  didnt know what to do  matt she puts her hands up very well mistakes are made and punishments are doled out so we  shall return to our village we shall lower the barrier to you and all shall /none/ be fine  sam and our gray stone friend  matt he is your punishment for your infraction but weve learned our lessons and you may go  about your way  sam how can we buy his freedom  liam weve got a tea set  laura how can we buy his freedom  matt there is no freedom to be bought in these worlds words and actions speak volumes and  youve crossed our people right now we could take you all as new entries to our garden we took  but one be thankful you got off /none/ quite as easy the wishers set you free  laura thanks wisher  marisha its okay i can fix it  sam what what do you mean  marisha i have greater restoration she left right that wasnt in front of her i didnt say  that to her  matt okay she says very well good luck on your endeavor the rest of the pixies gather up  around grogs body and you watch as they all glow and his stone form as heavy as it should be  suddenly becomes weightless  sam wait  taliesin wait no /none/ we need that  marisha oh theyre taking him oh i cast earthbind on grog  sam earthbind  marisha yeah it should ground him  matt it does he slams into the ground with all the weight of a falling stone goliath into the  dirt at which point the pixies immediately go off and turn around you would cast incantations  towards us  marisha no i cast it to my friend who is about 12 foot tall and a giant target come on dont  make stories up where there arent any  matt stories nothing  /none/ marisha what you fairies are manifesting these ideas okay you are creating a dichotomy that  does not exist  matt they all gather and begin to whisper to each other their heads darting around  marisha oh see look theyre doing it right now  matt at this point this display is enough your words and your actions speak in difference in  entirely opposing directions if you are to continue to throw these words these deceptions  these lies in our direction then perhaps well take you all for our garden  taliesin i wouldnt advise that  /none/ matt then let us take him and you move on with your lesson and they go and pick him up once  more  laura wouldnt you rather have a song wouldnt you rather have how often do you get a  performance  taliesin i cast hex on the main pixie  matt you do  taliesin i do  sam thats it its on i call out to the main pixie wait whats your name  matt at this point you guys watch as a shadow all of a sudden darts up from the ground and  clings /none/ around the pixie she whips around at which point you now hear another impact as the  stone grog slams into the ground all the pixies scattering around  marisha see that is what it looks like when an incantation is targeted at you  taliesin its not very nice is it  matt you now watch as all of the various very gently falling fairy lights begin to flitting and be  absorbed by the pixies of the forest as their glows intensify the purple halo growing you see  the central elder figure of the wisher pixies say /none/ at least our allegiances now lie bare i need  you all to roll initiative  laura can you quickly  marisha its one action its one fucking action i just looked it up for that reason thats not  good thats not a good initiative at all  laura natural 20 on an initiative i dont know what i can do to them  taliesin 27  marisha i notoriously roll terrible on my initiative  sam how many are there  taliesin a lot but they die quick  marisha are they going to form a  laura /none/ a voltron  marisha thats exactly what i was thinking yeah  laura i feel like it would be easier to hit if it was a giant voltron  liam oh that angle is not going to be kind to those trees  taliesin whats the best check to give him i can give him disadvantage on an ability check so  wisdom or intelligence  liam the werewolves were honorable these guys are assholes  laura yeah i know  taliesin i feel better about killing them  laura me too theyre dicks they were going to take grog /none/  marisha they were trying to take grog fucking assholes i feel like we were very reasonable  considering how unreasonable we normally are  sam we were put between a rock and hard place  marisha and a hard grog  sam and we had no choice really it was a bad situation  laura grog is on the ground oh he is on the ground  matt yes he is  travis im stoned  sam if grog is permanently corrupted we know that we can download a fresh one from  backblazecom  laughter  travis beautiful /none/ that was too good  taliesin just couldnt let it go im so sorry i just couldnt let it go  marisha was that my fault this time it was a mild combination i might have contributed  sam we shouldve fought the fucking werewolves  laura yeah we shouldve but we didnt because were idiots  matt all right initiative order we have 25 to 20  taliesin 27  laura 27 as well with a natural 20  sam 21 for me  taliesin we are some fast motherfuckers  sam i got sleep  matt all right /none/ 20 to 15  laura those fairies are so spread out i thought they would all be together  matt as soon as they dropped they fanned out  taliesin we were trying really hard not to shoot first  matt 15 to ten  liam 13  matt ten to five and grog is stone sorry buddy  marisha you first bud coming for you first  matt all righty top of the round percy and vex youre up first  taliesin wheres the one that i hexed  matt the one that you hexed which i will mark /none/ here looking overhead you can see is the one with  the brighter vibrant glow right there that is currently the one so im marking that as the hex  right there there you go  taliesin do you think theyre really hard to hit because theyre small  laura probably im going to move over to my left  matt okay here  laura yeah a little bit more i want to line them up in a cone so if i can get as many in a  cone as i can  matt okay do we have the /none/ cone templates because theyre not by me right now  laura its a 60foot cone there that i have its a big cone  matt its a very big cone  liam what about just a comb  laura i want to cast hunters mark on the shiny one that he hexed as well  matt hunters mark on that one as well  laura double theyre weak you guys milk jug rings take them out  matt thank you zack i appreciate that so 60foot cone you can get four of them into it  laura that gets the /none/ mamba jamba okay good thats what i want  marisha what we dont want to do is spread out too much and get fucked  laura conjure barrage  matt conjure barrage all right dexterity saving throw all right  laura its a 15 for me  matt thats a success success success 18 19 19 and 16 all succeed  laura so they take half 3d8 halved  matt so roll damage halved grogs stone form takes full damage  laura oh sorry 15 halved plus hunters mark damage on the  matt on the one so roll for /none/ that one  laura i got three on that  taliesin dont forget to trinket  laura thats one action isnt it  taliesin is it an action  matt its an action to cast yeah  laura so i cant use trinket yet because i already did something  matt all righty so as everyone gathers up immediately as the fight begins you can see as vex  puts a hunters mark on the purple glowing pixie and then pulls out an arrow releases it and then  it scatters into a blast of various shards of sharpened wood /none/ metal and stone that goes  shooting into the nearby trees you can see the bark of the nearby tree trunks being covered with  various bits of ranger shrapnel as most of the pixies try and avoid but most getting blasted  with some semblance of impact  thats going to end your turn unless you want to move some more  laura i want to duck behind that tree like its going to do anything  travis how many points of damage was that  matt to you to your stone form that was 15  travis 15 /none/  matt from the blast of the impact you can see parts of the stone get rough a little bit at  certain points  travis i can break  laura you can break  matt statues can break and thats bad  laura thats super bad  travis somebody lost an arm that way  matt do you want trinket to move at all  laura trinket runs and stands next to keyleth  matt all right got it that brings us to percy same turn  taliesin taking a shot with retort with the little pistol at the /none/ fucker ive marked dear god  almighty 16 to hit  matt 16 does not hit as you try to shoot this tiny little glowing thing darts out of the way and  the bullet goes wide  taliesin shoot again thats better 25  matt that does hit  taliesin okay it has been way too long since ive done this its making me a little nervous  there we are thats 11 points of piercing damage thats with three points of necro in there  matt all right so thats your second attack this time you do see /none/ as it moves out of the way  you compensate for it and fire this time you see the purple glow flicker as it takes an impact and  recaptures itself into its original position  taliesin and im going to take one more shot at it with remind me if i can do this deadeye  with sharpshooter  matt deadeye sharpshooter you can do that  taliesin all right deadeye sharpshooter thank god this is just sucking oh my fucking god i miss  matt okay you dont misfire all right so after the second shot hits you /none/ fire trying to  compensate a third time but the pixie actually stays in position and your fire goes wide once more  taliesin all right now im diving behind that tree bottom right heading that way yeah  matt cool that ends your turn the purple pixie leader the mystic you mentioned before now  angrily comes fluttering forward as you both have vanished seeing this little circumstance is  going to from this position look towards you at the very front vax  liam shit  matt it begins reciting under its breath  sam ill do counterspell /none/ at level six  marisha oh snapricot  taliesin did you just say snapricot  marisha im a fucking hipster  taliesin this is going so poorly  liam gollum voice nasty  matt as you cast your counterspell mark off your 6thlevel spell it finishes the incantation as  it does a bit of arcane energy sprays forth from its fingertips and dissipates around it  liam aw thats sad  matt darts backwards  laura out of camera view  matt all right scanlan youre up  sam theyre so far and i dont know what they can /none/ do probably a lot ill step towards that  tree in front of me in front of the bear and the girl  matt thats far as you can get  sam that cluster of the pixies over there ill see if i can get three of them in a fireball  matt okay  sam if i can the leader and the ones closest to the leader but i dont know if im within range  matt okay you just using a single charge for it  sam oh yeah i have lots of charges dont i  matt /none/ how many came back you have to roll for the last couple of times youve gotten a full rest  sam i havent used them in a long time  matt yeah thats true actually  sam ill use two a 4thlevel spell right  matt 4thlevel fireball  sam so its 9d6  matt okay  sam range is 150 feet radius is 20 feet  matt all right as you pull out the wand and release it one of the nearby pixies it has no  effect  taliesin assholes  sam wait they can do that too /dung/  matt oh my god other people can counter  liam passiveaggressive dungeon master oh thats so sad oh  matt so the wand once again sputters out as well  sam its dead or it still might work after that  matt well it might still work after that  sam that one use okay can i move any more or am i all moved out  matt thats the end of your movement  sam ill inspire keyleth ill turn to her and say singing its been a hard feys night and  youve got to unfreeze grog /none/ its been a hard feys night because weve been fighting like a dog  marisha okay i can do that  matt that the end of scanlans turn all right its now the pixies turn  liam damn it bobby  laura theyre all super magic superduper magic  matt actually its going to stay here and before it moves that will be in range if i could  have keyleth make a wisdom saving throw  marisha this is my bailiwick yo  taliesin you also have an inspiration die  marisha i have an inspiration die ooh i /none/ dont think ill need it though 28  matt 28 yeah no effect on you whatsoever  marisha you even lift bro come at me bro got the john cena going on  matt this one over here as it flutters by after seeing you attempt to cast the spell scanlan i  need you to go ahead and make a  wisdom saving throw  sam oh boy advantage against magic  matt thats magic in general  taliesin yeah im looking at it yeah advantage versus magic on his saving throw  matt from what though  sam /none/ i dont know bard shit  marisha is it because war caster  matt no war caster is advantage on concentration checks to maintain  sam no its not war caster its something else  taliesin its on his sheet which means he found it somewhere  marisha and its typed its typed up its not written in  sam i probably didnt get it anyway actually both rolls were shitty and i only rolled a total  of five on the better one  matt so as the pixie darts to the side it mutters something underneath it and /none/ raises its  hands up scanlan all of a sudden your body shimmers for a second and you guys watch as the  already small gnome becomes even smaller  laura were going to die  matt he is now a badger  sam im a what im a badger  matt it then continues its movement over here by the side of the tree  sam gnome cunning matt  travis i tried to be diplomatic  taliesin a lot of good it did you  laura whyd you do that  liam thats scanlans bag man  travis /none/ yeah but i thought we were all never mind  taliesin we would be getting our asses kicked by a group of werewolves right now  travis people were preparing tea you were being cordial i was trying to be disarming next time  everything dies  sam this is our punishment for  taliesin trying to settle this amicably  matt for intelligence wisdom or charisma  sam yeah that was a wisdom  matt yeah so youre fine universal so strength saves it doesnt help for any of those  sam its just saves against magic for those /none/ three things  matt this other one here glancing over and seeing you there is going to look towards you i  need you to make a wisdom saving throw  liam ive got advantage good i got a 19  matt 19 you have advantage from  liam being a halfelf oh its not charm is it then the first one was shitty ten or 11  somewhere around there  matt you are a kitty cat  liam can i use luck to take my second roll i have luck left  matt you have one luck left /none/  liam i have two luck left after sleeping  matt yeah technically  liam okay so the second was a 17 plus two wouldve been a 19  laura so youre not a kitty cat  liam no i really would like to be a kitty cat  sam what happened  liam i asked if i could use one of my lucks instead  sam so wait hes not a kitty cat  liam in my heart i am a kitty cat  laura grog is stone  liam theres worse things than being a kitten right  /none/ matt this one over here leans towards you keyleth i need you to make another wisdom saving  throw  marisha already come on come at me bro  liam we should have all been pixies from the beginning  marisha okay 27  matt 27 you never roll low on those wisdom saving throws its really frustrating  marisha wise as fuck  matt all righty now comes to vax  liam click go the boots im going to run 12 squares and squat down just north of grog im not  going to shit on you i think /none/ i can make it all the way around to the other side of grog and im  going to dagger dagger dagger at queen of the pixies there  matt right there okay go for it  liam okay first is shit second is a natural 20 third is an 18  matt okay second two hit  liam all right yeah but its not anything fancy thats the weakness of the rogue wheres  my pyramid there it is so the first one which was the critical is big 11 for the first one on a  critical and /dung/ the second one ill put poison on it as well seven for the damage and its a dc  of 15 for poison  matt for poison it does not succeed it is poisoned  liam thats 2d10 14 with poison  matt nice all right so now the mystic the central pixie is fluttering but its not looking  amazing all right so that ends your turn all righty that brings us to keyleth  sam shouldnt have gone in that cave man  marisha can i dash and go a little bit further and still do an action /none/ and lose a bonus action  no its either like run or nothing  matt a dash is an action meaning you move and then your dash to move more is your action  marisha okay heres what im going to do im going to try and start making my way towards grog  im going to do the 30 feet towards him  matt okay  marisha do i see the fairy leader  matt you see her with a little bit of cover  marisha im going to blow my 6thlevel spell im going to cast sunbeam and /none/ sunbeam her in the face  taliesin does that go through her theres one on the other side of her  marisha oh does it go through to the one on the other side behind her  matt no it would go in this direction shes right here  marisha i was looking at the red one closer to me i dont have the fucking pointer  sam thats grog the red thing near you is grog  marisha no not that fucking red this one yes that one jesus and the one behind it  matt all right so /none/ as you muster your sunbeam the leader who has not used her reaction yet is  going to attempt to counter that  marisha no  matt 6thlevel though so it isnt an autocounter she has to roll for it  sam its a contested thing  marisha fucking bitch i said bitch i was trying to be nice to you fairies  matt counterspell so that dc is 16 that is a 19  marisha no its not  matt it is 19 unfortunately  marisha goddamn it that was a 6thlevel spell  matt i know  liam /none/ the grace and poise of the ashari  matt as you muster your sunbeam the currently wounded poisoned let me check one thing real  fast on attack rolls and ability checks because shes poisoned she has disadvantage and has to  roll again  marisha thats right she does  matt a natural 20  travis no way  matt yeah so it still counters it so you go to put your sunbeam the light begins to build up  into the middle of your grasp as youre about to unleash it and she darts up from behind the /none/ side  of the tree and unleashes a torrent of arcane energy that feels like a gust of warm wind hits  and scatters the sunbeam from your grasp the spell lost  liam umbrasyl in the can fairies dead as shit  marisha you guys are supposed to have good parades  matt all right thats the end of your turn keyleth all right garmelie turns invisible  laura of course he does  sam dont they want to counterspell that  laura oh no and he took out a tree while he was at it  matt got /none/ to find a way to fix the glare on the mat without the angle falling forward all right  top of the round percy and vex you guys are up  laura you go  taliesin okay from my vantage point im going to sit down take out bad news take another deadeye  sharpshooter with bad news at the big fat fucker by the tree  matt as of right now technically you have no sight on her  taliesin i dont  matt you are way back there and she is completely behind the tree  taliesin can /none/ i take a step out to the left as long as she has less than threequarters cover  im okay  matt right so you would have to move shes very tiny and the tree thats probably five foot  or more thick so based on her size as part of her advantage in using these trees is youd have  to get over here before you can see her  taliesin okay so ill move to my right a little bit then and i will shoot that fucker thats  right in front of me  matt all right /none/ this one  taliesin yep sharpshooter and with deadeye  matt go for it  taliesin thats a natural 20 that makes the grit go away anyway so nice  travis fucking golden snitch  taliesin that actually wasnt the golden snitch i was just feeling like they had something on me  okay so this is double the dice  matt yeah you roll the dice and then double that  taliesin roll the dice double it and then i add everything lordy this is going to be  disintegration six 12 22 28 points of damage  matt /none/ 28 points of piercing damage  taliesin yep  matt to that one all righty thats adding the sharpshooter  taliesin yeah i rolled really low  matt okay gotcha okay so you take the shot the blast echoing throughout the trees and the  treeline you watch as the pixie takes the slug and actually gets thrown to the ground and then  flutters back up barely  taliesin flutters back up barely  matt yeah it was undamaged before  taliesin nothing fancy just hitting it again  matt all right  taliesin thats a 23  matt /none/ thatll hit roll damage  taliesin thats better 24 points of damage  matt 24 points of damage you hear this horrible high pitched yelps as the light is scattered by  a burst of what looks like a tiny blood spray and dust and smoke  taliesin i call out one and back up behind the tree  marisha out of how many  matt all right vex  laura okay if i step out from behind the tree do i have a sight on the big one  matt you do have a sight on the big one /none/ yes itll get cover bonuses youd have to get over here  to see it  laura can i walk over there then okay i walk to there i want to use my longbow of the sky  sentinel and attack it  matt you initiate the bow pull back the arrow and release as it splits into three different  arrows  laura natural 20  travis im looking at it  matt jesus christ okay  sam defying statistics one roll at a time  laura 12 plus 12 24  matt okay 24 wait 12 plus 12 /none/ 24 all right so the second one hits  laura and then 22 on the third  matt all three hit even with threequarters cover the last one just barely hits roll damage  on all three  taliesin kill them all  laura 20 on the first hit no oh shit you double the dice six thats 12  liam so add six to what you were saying originally you said 20 so itd be 26 if youre  doubling that die  laura 26 plus another five so 31 on the first hit  matt 31 on the /none/ first hit okay  laura 17 on the second  matt all right  laura 17 plus five is 22 on the third  matt you watch as the purple light gets stapled to a tree in the back you watch as the arrow hits  her and carries her and she tries to pull herself off of the arrow as its holding her against the  distant tree and then it goes limp against it and the light slowly fades  laura oh so i shout out two your leaders dead you want to still fight us  matt /none/ youve got two more squares of movement if you want to use them  laura i move towards the tree  matt this way or this way  laura that way  matt this way all righty that ends your turn it would

destination  and do greater restoration and unpetrify him  matt okay what level is that spell  marisha fucking 5th  matt 5thlevel only one of them has counterspell left and /none/ its going to attempt

fantastic now that ive burnt through two of my toplevel /none/ ones  matt you reach forward and grab grog you see the pulse of energy and it dissipates you look over  at the edge of the tree you see one of the pixies darting behind and disappears behind the trunk  that ends your turn back to the top percy and vex  taliesin ill go do you want to go first ill go first  marisha wait i wanted to do a bonus action i did want to do something on a bonus action  matt what do you want to do  marisha can i alter self /none/ my throat and howls give a wolf howl  matt sure make a performance check  sam

around and take a shot at that jerk right there with the retort pistol  not the bad news standard shot thats a 31 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin and thats 14 points of damage  matt that one /none/ is spattered by the impact you see the chunks of it hit the tree behind and you see  a wing right in front of you scanlan  taliesin i reload i flip around the other side of the tree  matt over to this side here  taliesin over to this side so i can get a good vantage point on that one that thinks its hiding  right over there i use my bonus action to cast hex on him  matt to carry it over  taliesin yep to carry it over and i take a shot /none/ at him thats 22 to hit  matt 22 hits  taliesin ten points of damage three necrotic  matt it gets shot the impact hits the tree next to it but it splinters and hits it takes some  damage but not a whole lot  taliesin im going to burn an action surge and take three more shots at it  matt you can do that youre ignoring the cover because of your sharpshooter feat so go for it  taliesin im going to roll a sharpshooter for that one as well which is great because i rolled /none/  a two and a natural 20 thats natural 20 with sharpshooter that also means that i lose that  grit this is going to be great thats great ten 20 30 36 points of damage  laura how many fairies are left  matt you have currently two fairies left  laura i dont see them on the board from where i am  matt no you dont see them theyre hidden  taliesin im taking two more steps and im getting that next fairy that thinks he can fucking  hide from me  matt there are two

over this way  laura can trinket reach it  matt trinket can try trinkets not going to be able to get there though  laura then im going to attack it can i attack it from where i am  matt you currently have no way of seeing it right now unless you move far enough in that direction  you may  laura im going to try to get into sight  matt thats as far as you can get i would say it has threequarters cover so you can attack it /none/  but it gets plus five to its ac  laura okay im going to attack it 23  matt 23 hits  laura then im going to attack it again with my blazing bowstring 26  matt that hits  laura can i move my hunters mark over  liam eye squint says no  matt sure because its a bonus action you wouldve done it  laura thanks man okay seven plus seven 22 on the first hit 24 on the second hit  matt arrows loosed off to the side one arrow actually grabs it by the /none/ shoulder and hits it  against the tree there and as it tries to pull the arrow out which is this giant shaft thats  shattered its shoulder entirely it looks back at you as you take its head off its shoulders  laura teeny tiny little piece of shit  travis the cutest swear ever  laura i cant move anymore  matt no thats as far as you can move does that end your turn scanlan youre up  sam do i see any of them  matt you do not  sam shit im going to run /none/ as far as i can into the open and see if i can see

and that cluster  sam do i have a clear shot without killing my friends  matt depends what youre doing  sam with a lightning bolt  matt its probably going to hit vax but who knows the effect lightning would have on /none/ stone  sam well then i wont do that ill cast bigbys hand at level seven and punch into that  liam big swollen hand fucking fat veins on the back of the hand  marisha have you been lifting bigby  laura youre looking good bigby  marisha you know those hulk gloves  matt at 7thlevel so it does an additional 4dwhatever it does so which ability are you  using bigbys hand  sam just a big old punch pummeling hand punching hand  matt the clenched fist roll a melee spell attack against its armor class /none/ so roll a d20 and add  your spell attack bonus  sam 25  matt that hits roll 8d8 force damage  sam 8d8 i dont even have any  taliesin heres two more d8  matt its 4d8 but because you did it two levels higher its 8d8  taliesin roll them twice whoa  marisha oh shit youre a force to be reckoned with they were all above seven  taliesin youre going to leave an impression in the tree  sam 45  matt where once there was a pixie there is a brief spatter of /none/ reddishpink mist and nothing  thereafter bigbys hand has sent it so hard to its afterlife that there is a small black mark on  the tree nearby where it once was just an echo of its existence at one point  taliesin you just clapped a fairy to death thats actually literally the opposite  marisha high five aw  sam is that all the pixies  taliesin theres one left  laura we shouldnt kill it see if it can unfreeze our friends  sam i got nothing left that was my action and bonus  matt all /dung/ right end of scanlans turn the pixie then turns about and begins running as it  disappears past the trees a little bit you watch as a large dark form lands right in front of it  it stops for a second and two giant claws reach down and grasp it in its hand pick it up and you  can see before you lord ukurat is now clutching this one pixie that was trying to escape looks  inside for a second chuckles vengeance is tasty chomps not very filling stomps  forward  laura be confident  matt /none/ so you called  sam we called because our plan worked perfectly and we were able to fulfill your deal to the  letter as we had always intended  matt make a deception check  marisha come on scanlan  sam i think im still at disadvantage  matt on ability checks you are  sam with disadvantage its a 30  matt you can also add your own bardic inspiration to your ability checks now because youre level  14 but if you feel pretty confident with it  sam im okay with 30  laura oh no /none/ should you add it add it  matt its too late  sam well never know  matt youre going to know pretty quick as you say this he comes forward and gets really low to  the ground with his arms out at the sides face right up to you he could snatch you up in one bite he  goes clever gnome stands back up so one pixie two pixie three four where is their leader  taliesin i walk over and scrape the tree  matt takes a look at it howls all the rest of the /none/ various members of his clan of the fendirs  begin to arrive in the distance  yes my lord  the mystic is dead wipe up the village come you have the rest of your deal to attend to  turns around and begins walking back toward the city of the pixies  laura we have some friends that are stone right now  matt then bring them along  sam keyleth do you need help  marisha i take my last 5thlevel spell to dump a greater restoration into grog to bring him back  from petrification  sam /none/ you cant do it to two people at the same time  marisha i can burn my 7thlevel spell to bring back vax  laura maybe you should do that  marisha i will burn my 7thlevel spell to greater restoration vax and bring him back  matt you come to consciousness grog suddenly in a different space than you recall a little  stiff in the joints like you just had a really bad nights sleep across a whole pallet of broken rock  travis diplomacy really isnt that bad  laura its not so bad good job grog /none/  travis im going to throw my weapons in the river hold on ill be right back  marisha you make a great parade balloon by the way you look great  travis why thank you  matt vax as you come to the heat of the moment you catch your breath again and feel that  achiness in your joints  liam i do i literally do  laura doesnt feel so good does it hey remember when i was made into stone were  twinkies  liam twinkies i dont think thats the term youre reaching for  /none/ travis all the wolves are back what happened  taliesin we are going to finish off the fairies  travis oh really  taliesin yes really  travis oh so something happened didnt it  taliesin it did  sam sorry grog  taliesin it was all your fault really you were very helpful  marisha to be fair i tried those fairies are shifty little shits  travis really they fought hard were going to kill more now  sam probably  travis any tips advice  taliesin hit hard repeatedly  sam dont use any of your lowerlevel /none/ spells  travis dont think thats a problem  taliesin no you burned your lowerlevel spells  marisha i am burnt out on all my higherlevel spells  travis are we cool with the wolves now  taliesin were starting to be  laura we have to go finish what we started though they want us to still desecrate the stones  liam scanlan  sam im ready ive eaten a lot of things today  matt garmelie appears behind one of the trees is everything cool everything good  marisha oh my god youre still here  matt okay /none/ no i was got you guys back  laura did you draw a lot of the fight i hope you did because we kicked some ass there  matt he opens his sketch pad and you can see theres a bunch of hastily drawn sketches of vax  turned to stone with his finger up his nose grog in the ground with his stone thumb up his butt  smiling with his other thumb up in the air like he was and the rest of you fumbling your attacks as  the pixies are laughing  laura sweet nice very /none/ good that tree just moved  taliesin they do that here  matt welcome to the feywild so you guys make your way nightward following the fendirs  taliesin i guess its the only way out of here  matt you journey with them they make a pretty quick pace even at your fastest you resort to  tracking them theyre moving with quite alacrity and they know this forest really well as you guys  begin to approach the outskirts of the little grove where the wishers existed you see a heavy  battle has just begun to calm /none/ down you see two additional wolf statues now stand amongst the  area but the abodes have been destroyed you see that the tiger has grabbed a pixie and tears it in  half a couple others that have been darting off in the distance trying to escape three more  of the wolves jump up into the trees and you see them jumping from branch to branch before their lights  marisha we tried i didnt want this to happen  taliesin its a violent world  matt at this point they all begin to slowly gather again towards /town/ the center of the town or  what used to be the pixie town from the treetop boom lord ukurat lands next to the stone circle  looks out towards you guys even beyond the tree line  sam grog care to do the honors  travis absolutely i walk up to lord pup  liam im going to follow close behind grog  matt all the rest of the fendirs which are now a few more in number than you initially met before  we have two more that have turned to stone so theres now five total that /none/ are stone in the  center of this village but looks to be about nine of them now gathered up centrally to this space  lord ukurat in the center theyre beginning to follow in around you guys keeping a perimeter  ukurat looks down at you as you approach so honor comes at the end of the journey we made a pact  and you completed your end we complete ours you are free to pass through this forest as lord  ukurat reaches down and grabs two of the stones you can see as his fingers grab them /none/ theyre  burning his palms singeing theres a bunch of energy pushing back on him as his fur is blown and  theres a bright light emanating from the center of the circle wrestles them forth from the  ground as he does theres a crack of thunder that cascades throughout the center of the forest  all of you feel the impact the stone circle the glowing quartz now dims and goes cold the center  where it used to be vibrant grass slowly turns to a dull gray and withers between the stones throws  them to the /none/ ground now we are all free you say you travel duskward to the corrupted tree yes  laura yes  matt i will follow as my people find a new home for tonight should you need my help just call  and i will be at your back  laura you are a powerful ally  matt as are you brethren go spread find a home again i will return to you once this debt is  paid now ill be watching he leaps into the treetops as the rest of the wolves begin to back  away from you /none/ and vanish into the shadows of the forest  laura is there anything around that looks good to take  sam should we loot the mini city  taliesin i am absofuckinglutely looting this city are you mad  sam theyre tiny thimbles full of nothing  taliesin i have a dollhouse at home there are things that are necessary jesus  matt you are welcome to make some investigation checks to scour through the remains of this pixie  village  sam 17 for me  laura 23  matt 23 what was it again sorry  taliesin 13 /none/  matt the rest of you guys keeping back on this  taliesin im taking the crystals too the dead crystals  matt you take the dead crystals and the rest of them lift up like any other crystals theyre  lighter than you expected they seem almost frail like a volcanic rock in lightness and brittleness  but more dense you take those keep them to yourself  you guys look about and most any pixie furniture has been destroyed in searching through you do  find in some of the homes a number of wellpolished gems you find /none/ two sapphires that  are worth after looking over them for a bit in your experience with gems about 200 gold apiece  you find one cracked diamond it was very wellcut at one time as such what would have been worth  thousands of gold now is maybe close to a thousand gold at most it can maybe be repaired or brought  to somebody who can fix it up it might be worth more  you also find what looks to be a really intricately carved onyx statue of a dog about  that big its really wellcarved /none/ other than that most everything else is just inconsequential  decorations that wouldnt be much help to you as they were smaller people  taliesin i say we get to the edge out of this forest and then maybe call it a night  marisha im a bit tapped on my higherlevel energy but can i maybe take a minute to ritual  cast greater restoration on the two new statues of the lycanthropes  matt is that a ritual i dont believe it can be cast as a ritual can it  marisha greater restoration i cant take my /none/ time with it  matt you would have to stay here the night and do it again  marisha theyll figure it out  travis the gray ground thats been burned is it just  matt just where the circle was  travis not everything else  matt no just the circle  travis i feel like we just killed ferngully  laura yeah i know we did
