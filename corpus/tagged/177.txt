none	 and their two jobs  for the gentleman return with a new friend a new companion and the memory of an old you spent two  weeks in zadash utilizing your downtime some to a very successful level some at a nearly terribly  not successful level but managing to skirt by youve taken your time decided on a new path a  new adventure ahead of you loaded up your things and currently with your cart horses and selves  together you begin making your way towards the southern area of zadash and out towards the roads  ahead 
none	 so this is your very last chance if theres anything you need to do in the city or  forever hold your peace  travis i need to pee  matt roll a constitution check  liam too real  travis yes  taliesin do we want to raid the adult bookstore one more time just kidding  travis 21  matt 21 you can hold it for three more days  travis okay good 20  taliesin youre just going to make a sloshing sound when you walk for a while  liam caleb has to find new garage 
town	 sales to dive through  taliesin i am all for that  matt as you guys reach the southern gates to the exterior of zadash with the creaking of chains  and the heavy thudding as the large wooden barriers slowly drift open to allow you and a few  other carts outward onto the main road you glance out onto the southern hills below you in the  marrow valley and you can see the faint dusting of distant snow that has begun to melt in the recent  warmer days that have come the roads themselves are slick 
none	 and heavy with mud from the snow and  rainfall that has managed to still seep in you can hear hooves making their way through the mud  as you push past the barrier now last time you were here you recall seeing large numbers of  military that had gathered of the righteous brand of which there are very few left it looks like  most have gone eastward and found their way towards the skirmishes you continue to hear about  on the borders of xhorhas and the ashguard garrison the gates close behind you and you  
town	 begin making your way now free again in the marrow valley southward towards your destination of the  menagerie coast first off who is going to be guiding this first leg of the path that is three  days of travel to alfield along the road whos going to be keeping an eye out all right we have  caleb for that anybody helping caleb  travis yeah ill help caleb  taliesin you think you got it all right  travis since weve traveled this once before did you want to join  laura no its fine  travis 
none	 i mean ladies first if you  laura no its all you  matt because i glossed over this last session caleb as you sit there holding the reins to the  horses in front and youre focusing ahead your mind slips back into contemplative thought  recalling the time you had spent focusing on the dodecahedron remembering when you had spent a bit  of time over this twoweek break studying and trying your best to understand the nature of its  enchantment or history its a strange device to behold for sure it both seems refined and primal 
none	  you have no idea the source or the length of time that its existed or what its true purpose is  focusing onto it once again allowing your consciousness to slip gently towards wherever this  object draws it in it feels like youre looking into infinite space both within and beyond this  small geometric shape you take a moment to focus you can sense and see light and cloud and matter  and vacuum this kind of expanse of everything and nothing between these long stretches you feel  like theres an absence around you but the 
none	 more time you spend the more you adjust to the space  the more your vision clarifies the more the darkness is not pure darkness but a weave of  millions of tiny threads all moving faintly traveling in different directions tugged by some  unseen force independently you watch one thread you pick one focus and you can see it pulling  along and it brightens and brightens and brightens until it reaches in that tiny little  infinitesimal push a burst of light and it changes direction and you see in that space where  that burst of 
none	 light had happened you see seven other shadowthreads begin to emerge from that  point that then fade away to nothing the thread having now curved and taken a different path a  choice a decision made and a different destiny for whatever that strange thread is following and  pulling back you now see the thousands tens of thousands millions of these that all wander in  their own independent solitary directions some crossing some parallel some alone and you  wonder what all of this means and what this has to do with the essence of this device 
town	 the powers  that it seems to impart and what it is that the kryn dynasty has designs for you come back in to  your moment on the cart as youre rocking back and forth down the pathway hearing the hooves on the  muddy now getting drier portions of the roadway you glance around at your friends and  shake your head for a moment and focus once more on the road before you  taliesin mr caleb  marisha thats an old joke  taliesin what are you playing with over there seemed really intent on whatever 
none	 it was  liam oh im thinking back on it now  matt yeah  liam ask jester to show you the thingy in her bag  laura ooh  liam okay ignore that  taliesin its too late im already ready for it all right  liam its something we picked up the first time we came through zadash  taliesin gotcha hey miss jester apparently you picked something up in zadash im supposed to  see the thingy in your bag  laura which thingy  taliesin i dont know caleb was being very shifty about it  
none	 laura theres some really questionable thingies in here but you can see them if you want  taliesin id like to see any questionable thing you may have  laura okay well theres that  taliesin what is that  laura you dont want to know  taliesin is that even natural  laura well and then theres that thingy caleb doesnt know about it but he will later and  then oh were you talking about this its this box  taliesin what is this thing  laura okay well inside of it  matt its gone critical  
dung	 laura open it up and just let your mind go and see what you think  taliesin im going to meditate into the box  matt okay you focus and youre familiar roll a third character  laughter  taliesin too soon  matt you who have spent a large portion of your life in various states of meditation the  gravitational pull of whatever essence of this object is is something you are familiar with and  comfortable letting take over and with that your consciousness slips seemingly beyond your physical  form and into whatever dark space it 
none	 seems to have drawn you towards in this space you begin to  very quickly pick up on details similar to what caleb had taken so long to focus on  independently you begin to pick up the themes and the ideas of what all these strange threads these  taliesin does this place make me feel a little uncomfortable  matt no its it feels in a weird way like youre  bird sounds  marisha whispers theyre in the rafters  sam no its good its good leave it  matt im just turning it down  marisha 
none	 pigeons everywhere  matt shh were roleplaying marisha  laughter  matt it doesnt feel unnatural it feels like a view behind the curtain  taliesin okay  matt is the best way i can describe it but it doesnt bother you its a little cold and a  little alien but it doesnt feel unnatural  taliesin all right  matt as you pull back you feel something comes back with you and as your consciousness  refocuses theres a slight shred of milky grey energy that withdraws itself and then with a warm  impact disappears into your 
none	 chest  taliesin huh i think i have a passenger and thats interesting  laura did you see the little ball the little grey ball  taliesin i did  laura wasnt it weird  taliesin it was  laura is he inside of you now  taliesin he is it is  laura oh you think its an it not a he  taliesin im trying to not make assumptions  liam hurry up and stuff that thing back in her bag  laura oh thats right people are looking for it  taliesin good to know ill keep 
none	 mums the word huh  marisha yeah its nice right its like a little postcoital feeling kind of  taliesin i wouldnt know but  travis has everybody focused on that thing now  sam marisha laura i have  travis i should probably do that at some point  taliesin you should probably experience this its interesting  liam you are not allowed to you know  travis oh no i wouldnt hums i just want to look  laura you cant look at it though today  travis why not  laura because he already has it  
none	 taliesin tomorrow  travis okay  laura you have so many balls inside of you already  marisha its true  liam ja balls deep  laura lots of them  travis leave it alone  marisha i know so close  travis razors edge  matt caleb id like you to roll a perception check with advantage with caduceuss aid  liam thank you for bringing it back to the material plane  matt welcome back in  liam that is pretty good thats an 18  matt 18 okay as you progress for the first couple of days 
town	 heading south along the road  camping without issue at the beginning of the third day when youve begun taking your camp and  reassembling it making your way back to the road  liam point of order theres also a hut now as part of the nightly routine  matt thats right yeah which is still visible but impenetrable and there has not been an issue  you do wake up and notice that there maybe have been a few tracks that made their way towards your  camp they appear to be hoofbased in nature but had wandered 
town	 and circled around and made their way  beyond your location probably just something natural in the vicinity that was curious about  what this strange dome was in the space where you had made camp but you gather your things you  make your way onto your cart and with the better part of the next the third days travel right  as the sun begins to set you can see ahead the small treeline that surrounds the nowglowing  windows of the town of alfield  marisha back in alfield  laura back to the beginning of our 
none	 notes  marisha this is where bryce lives right we should check in with bryce  liam is it looking as we near it is it looking a little more put back together  matt as you begin to go closer you can see while theres still light in the sky you can see  that there are a number of building structures that have been reframed and it looks like there  was both a volunteer effort as well as a number of hired masons and volunteers that are in the  process of rebuilding a lot of what 
town	 had been damaged or burned down when the gnolls had  originally assaulted it the last time you were here by the time you reach the actual streets  making your way along the one central thoroughfare that cuts across the center of town you can see  some of the folks who are finishing up their daily work as theyre losing light some light up  torches and continue to work and toil into the early hours of the evening others begin to close  up taking their ladders down finishing for the days work and make their way 
tavern	 to local tavern or  homestead to make food and bed down for the evening but as you pass by a few folks do notice  your presence look over at the cart and recognize you and wave in your direction  travis how do  matt they wave and seem almost nervous excited but both not quite sure how to act in your  presence you see one familiar halfling who had previously lost his entire inn who glances over  in your direction  sam thadeus candleglow  matt mmhmm  sam yes  travis damn note taker 
none	  laura its right there  travis ten points to gryffindor fuck  matt he runs up and you can see theres a lot of dust and bits of wood splinters on the shoulders  and edges of the sleeves as the halfling runs up and glances over and goes i wasnt expecting to  see yall return things are going along well were doing what we can  laura how much have you built back already  matt well weve gotten the basis of the bottom floor mostly restored structurally were going to  try and fill in the 
none	 walls and then well head on to the second floor there i surmise we probably  have another four months or so before were up and operational  laura not bad though really  travis really good progress yeah  matt well i can lend that to most of these fine folks whove been so gracious in helping he  points to a few other people who have either left or are in the process of packaging up their tools  and materials as well they kind of acknowledge and glance over i wish i could give you a room 
none	  to stay in id do it free of charge but  laura we dont need one we have this magical dome that we sleep in now its really cool  matt wow whoa  laura you should rent some of those out i bet people would really like it  taliesin magic domes  matt ill get right on it  marisha shift pods  taliesin i wasnt going to say it  matt well anyway i dont want to take any more of your time i just saw you coming through and  wanted to say thank you 
tavern	  marisha hey thadeus  matt yeah  marisha is bryce in  matt they should be i havent seen them around very recently but if youre going to find them  somewhere in here theyre probably  marisha broad barn  matt probably at the broad barn or actually bryce would be  travis candleglow no  matt no candleglow was the inn that he is currently  liam theres the feed  mead tavern theres broad barn theres crate and barrel  matt bryce would probably be over at the salt trench  sam the jail  matt 
none	 yeah thats where theyve been keeping their attention as of late look at you taking  notes im so proud  sam no one else on this side of the table is going to take any meaningful notes  laura no i have theyre just mostly  sam its dick pics all over the place  matt thats important too  laura its memory lane i see a big head of something shaped like a bowling ball  sam and this one looks like a poo in a bathtub  laura it is its a stinky but that was caleb 
town	 i think  taliesin yeah i remember that  liam good times  marisha im finding a bunch of old dumb jokes  taliesin its a very good bathtub its got claw feet i appreciate that  marisha this isnt where we left no this isnt where we left reginald no okay  travis lets make our way over there  sam yeah thats a good idea  matt so heading over to the eastern side of town you start finding the edge of the forest  where the street of alfield comes to an end and the furthest building 
dung	 towards the forest youve  passed it before but not spent much time in its proximity is a dark grey stone building with a  dark weathered wood frame set around it torches set exterior and it has the simple sign that says  the salt trench jail there is one crownsguard whos kind of leaning against the wall it looks  like theyre not asleep but definitely not in full energy per se long piece of some sort of a  wheat dangling out of their mouth theyre chewing hey can i help you  laura hey were here 
none	 to see bryce  matt im going to go see if theyre available ill be right back  laura he looked like he didnt even remember us  sam maybe hes new  travis yeah he could be reinforcements  laura we killed a whole bunch of gnolls for them  marisha to be fair i dont remember him  travis hey caduceus you should probably be aware we fought off a bunch of gnolls when we  were making our way up through here  laura we cut off their ears and sold them for money  travis what 
none	 kind of gnolls you ask regular  taliesin do i know what a gnoll is  matt make a nature check  taliesin 11  matt yeah youve heard of gnolls youve never seen one youve never encountered one but as far  as your knowledge goes theyre just nasty big dog people  marisha sometimes they arent regular though sometimes theyre undead ones  taliesin irregular gnolls  marisha yeah but we fought both  taliesin irregular ones  travis harder to fit in what we want to  matt at this point the guard comes back pokes through 
none	 the doorway may i ask whos asking  travis yeah the mighty nein has come calling  sam were we called that back then  travis i dont know  sam i dont remember  matt actually thats where you coined the name  sam oh good yeah  travis yep thats it  matt all right let me go check and heads back in about a moment passes and you hear some  footsteps coming and there you see coming through the doorway bryce helmet off theyre still  wearing their armor they look a bit overworked maybe not 
dung	 getting enough sleep a little bit of  dark circles under the eyes but other than that healthy their blond shoulderlength hair has a  soft curl to it is pulled up in the back and looks to be tied to keep out of the way as they  come through the door frame a smile on their face i wasnt expecting company let alone such welcome  liam nabend  matt its good to see you  marisha what are you doing here you working here now  matt im working wherever its necessary i keep watch on here 
none	 i help the starosta maintain  general matters here with the crownsguard but stationed wherever its necessary were a bit  light on manpower given the bulk of it is required now to the eastern side of the empire  laura ooh so if were going to commit a crime now would be a good time huh  travis jester  matt in theory which is why im not sleeping as well but its good to see you jester  laura you too  travis how has it been busy peaceful  matt both  liam any trouble here at 
town	 home  matt none thankfully we took them down last week but it was decided that recovering some of  these gnolls that you had slaughtered and as garish as it was placing their heads as a  warning on the outskirts of town prevented for a while any sort of incursions seemed to be a  decent deterrent however the smell got a bit intense for the farmers and we decided to dispose  of them but everything seems fine were far enough from all that chaos to the east hows  everything been with you last i saw 
none	 you you were heading to zadash i apologize it took a little  bit with the chaos here but i just sent a report up to the lawmaster up there orentha should know  of your deeds soon  sam thank you for that thats very kind  laura did you just call us the mighty nein or did you describe what we look like  matt i gave a brief description  taliesin im new  matt right whats your name  taliesin caduceus caduceus clay pleasure youre a lot shorter than the last one they  matt bryce 
none	 bryce feelid  taliesin introduced me to  matt thats all right pleasure to meet you you are very tall and strange  taliesin yeah ive noticed everybody else is very short its fascinating  matt well welcome to alfield any friends of these are friends of ours  taliesin pleasure to make your acquaintance  matt of course are you passing through or youve come to stay for a bit  sam passing through  liam yeah maybe stay for the night before moving on  matt well of course of course you need not worry about finding lodging 
tavern	 we can have that arranged  laura oh wow thank you  matt weve done that before we can do it again well i have a little bit more business to attend  to and then ill be off my shift and perhaps ill join you for drinks  laura party time  matt just a moment if you wouldnt mind go ahead and let crute know that youve arrived at  the feed  mead tavern and ill meet you there in an hour or so  laura okay  sam all right  matt its lovely to see 
none	 you all  laura you too im glad youre not in the war right now  matt me too bryce turns around and then comes back theres one your other friend with the–  laura molly  marisha yeah  matt right at this point they nod their head say no more weve all lost our share of loved  ones this world can be a dangerous one at times im sorry for your loss  sam thank you for that  matt well come ill meet you soon and well have drinks in his honor  sam yes  
town	 matt then bryce makes their way back inside the building you guys are welcome to do anything else  you wish to prepare for though it is starting to get into the evening hours and based on your  previous experience in alfield you know this is one of those towns that primarily shuts down  postsunset this is mostly a farming town  taliesin this is a place where you did good thats nice  sam yeah we did  laura its halves and halvsies you know  taliesin i dont know everywhere that ive been with you so 
town	 far people seem to be really happy to  see you its a sign in my opinion  marisha this might have been the first town we did good  travis i think thats right actually  marisha because we kind of got a guy–  travis arrested  marisha arrested and thrown in jail for  travis an indeterminate amount of time  laura yeah but then we were helping other people though at the same time so  travis this was the first one we made a clean positive impact though minimal collateral damage  marisha came through 
none	 in the black not broken even  travis no ious or you know  laura caleb do you need to buy paper here or anything  liam no i am all set  laura okay just making sure  sam lets go to the feed and the mead  matt you guys make your way to the feed  mead crute recognizes you as you enter its good to  see all of you again welcome please sit down i will prepare food i suppose for many more than i  was expecting  laura for bryce too theyre coming 
none	  matt good to know  laura gasps  sam what  laura i use thaumaturgy to open all of the windows  matt crashing all of the windows slam open loudly theres the sound of breaking glass on the  far side as one of the windows is shattered from the impact wind swoops in and you watch as  crute whos faced away making the way to the kitchen stops and goes groaning  laura singing memories  matt makes his way into the kitchen to finish the meal an hour or so passes a couple other folks 
none	  come in some of them dont seem to recognize you or didnt interface with you directly a handful  do and they come by and offer to buy a drink crute returns with some basic foods– most  everything here is everything from lightly cooked vegetables or boiled vegetables to some treated  and salted meats they dont have a wide variety of dishes here but it is still delicious and very  classic homeontheroad food bryce eventually comes and joins you the first time youve seen  them out of their formal attire and armor bryce comes in 
tavern	 with a light blue soft tunic over some  light brown leggings and comfortable boots very relaxed and casual as they sit down at the table  and take an unclaimed tankard and leans back in the chair well i think weve all earned this cheers  sam travis and laura cheers  matt to friends here and not  laura and nott  matt and nott  sam yes to me any crazy news around here or just the normal stuff  matt the normal recovery thankfully only one and a half fields were torched in the gnoll  
dung	 onslaught so hasnt been a huge detriment to our farming schedule other than that its been the  righteous brand passing through  sam the people we rescued from that cave nearby are they all fine not you know–  matt theres one of them right over there one of the individuals that came up and offered to buy  you drinks earlier you can see its one of the older bearded gentlemen who looks to be a little  you recognize him now once its pointed out  travis totally recognize him now  marisha ey yeah  matt 
none	 ey told you they remembered me  marisha totally know exactly what youre talking about  matt they never forget a face the mighty nein  sam he was crying when we rescued him  laura he was really dirty covered in a lot of–  marisha soot and dirt yeah  matt they all do if youre not paying attention bryce continues on a bit and tells you about how  theres word that the ashguard garrison has fallen ive been doing the best i can to keep my  ear to the ground on things happening east its 
town	 far enough away where no one heres worried but i  have friends in bladegarden and who were stationed at the rockguard which is the other garrison if  ones fallen i worry for the other but i know theyre sending all of their forces that way and  marisha wait when did this happen  matt you did hear about this from one of the town criers a little over a month ago when you were  leaving on the gentlemans errand  laura yes i remember that very well  travis kind of led to the influx of 
none	 people going out  marisha yeah thats when dairon decided to go right or was she already out there  matt probably i have to look back at my notes again  marisha sorry  matt its okay the time period in there its somewhere in that space  liam the trend is that its pushing closer in  matt from what ive heard theyve kept it at bay and there are intents to retake the garrison but  there were well over 2000 lives lost and i dont know how much there is specifically to say about  but 
dung	 the rumors are that the sky over that pass over the garrison itself lie as dark as midnight  throughout the day even  laura whoa theyve got some serious magic stuff over there  marisha yeah  travis is there any word from the south we happen to be heading that way  matt oh that makes sense if youre leaving zadash well in times of warfare– and i know  weve been notified of this via the information routes to the rest of the crownsguard and the  watchmasters to keep an eye– but i do believe entrance 
none	 to the empire is being very carefully  inspected you shouldnt have an issue leaving – its coming back in during a time of conflict  like this might take a while  sam is there anything that can speed up that process some papers or forms or stamps  liam coin  travis global entry  matt i can try and write you something but once again were a bit podunk here by comparison  i cant say that those at the wuyun gates are going to be more partial to what i have to say  but i

none	 moving  south and id really appreciate their cooperation in the process and how long we expect to be going for  travis out loud do you do this  taliesin yeah  travis all right just checking i didnt know if you had some mumbo jumbo  taliesin i mean can you do it without can you talk without talking is that a thing you can do  travis mumbling i dont think so am i talking  taliesin i can hear you but your lips arent moving this is nope its not working for me  nope probably 
none	 take ten minutes actually trying to do that before we get going  matt okay but you go ahead and ask permission of the horses  taliesin yeah  matt you watch as caduceus comes and quietly talks to each of the horses and it seems  ridiculous at first but as he finishes talking to the horse the horse nudges alongside him and  gives a hoof clop on the ground  travis youre a sevenfoot bob ross i love it  taliesin manners will get you everywhere  laura gasps manners  matt with that caduceus gets up 
town	 onto the cart next to jester pulls on the reins and with that  you guys begin to make your exit from alfield a second time  laura singing twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are  marisha what youre really good  taliesin thats some black magic right there  laura laughs i do that for way too long on the road  travis you sacrifice ronin to be able to do that  laughter  taliesin thats really impressive and you sound like a kid that fell down the well when youre  doing that 
town	  matt i dont know if you can just now do that or if youve always been able to do that and then  ronins your eventual payment of the contract  marisha firstborn  matt i know exactly as you guys are exiting alfield a few more folks come out to the street  to watch you leave some faces familiar a child a woman people that you recognize as individuals  you had helped make their way out of the mines long ago and you see them wave and they all say goodbye  laura bye  matt 
town	 a kid quietly raises a hand smiling too shy to say anything and with that you make your  way past the final buildings out of alfield and back onto the road south  laura aw man we saved their lives thats pretty cool  sam were awesome yeah  matt two days travel to trostenwald from alfield so which one of you wants to helm the  first watch  taliesin ill take first watch  laura oh yeah i was going to help him  matt all right so roll with advantage on your perception check please

none	 find a  few clusters of stone and rock that break up the rolling hills and tall grass that make up a large  part of the southern part of the marrow valley that youre used to you who come from a very  northern borderline tundra north of the savalierwood  taliesin its tundra except for my little patch  matt yeah taiga in places you can see this very green and open field is a whole new experience to  you and youre enjoying the details of it as you pass by the field mice that occasionally scurry 
town	  across the road and get snatched up by a hawk and youre like yep thats how it happens  travis oh shit  taliesin fair play  travis careful crossing the cawing  matt as youre glancing about you can see a lot of these natural stones placed and you see one  cluster of stones that doesnt look naturally placed theyre leaned at an odd angle if it had  been placed at or if it had been at that angle for a while it wouldve eventually settled  taliesin that doesnt look right  laura what doesnt 
none	  taliesin that  laura the field  taliesin now if i were inclined to be a trap or an ambush of some kind or those rocks shouldnt  be that way thats all im saying  matt as you glance over you can see three stones and one of them is about this big its a  pretty heavy stone and two longer slab stones and theyre all leaned against each other to look  natural but caduceus doesnt seem to feel that way  laura maybe somebody is sitting in the little alcove  taliesin its giving me 
town	 the bad feelings  laura should we go attack it  taliesin the rocks  laura i dont know  taliesin i mean im okay if you are  laura do you want to like  taliesin never had a rock really hit back  laura i hop off the cart and like  sam where are you going  laura how far away is it  matt its about from where you are now as youve traveled closer its about 80 to 100 feet  to the left off the road  liam where are you going  laura 
none	 im going to throw a little rock as hard as i can towards it  matt make a strength check  laura please be a good strength check  taliesin this looks a little weird to me  laura thats not good  taliesin its my mime  laura thats 11  matt 11 it arcs falls maybe about ten feet short in the grass no reaction  taliesin im going to use thaumagurgy to cast my voice very loudly behind the other side of the  rocks thaumaturgy it just got stuck in there  sam thaumagurgy  taliesin 
none	 thaumagurgy i want to use my thaumagerchy  matt okay so as far as thaumaturgy you cant throw your voice so much as you can amplify  the volume  taliesin oh so i cant throw my voice then  matt ill say you can throw it a little bit you cant flank it per se but you can give it a  little more of a force from one side ill say  taliesin hang on a second i can do tremors in the ground  matt yeah if you want  taliesin so im going to start tremoring 
none	 the ground right over by those rocks  matt okay it shakes a bit and you can see some bits of loose rock on top of this weird stone  construct begin to vibrate fall off the side no reaction  laura maybe somebodys buried there  liam i poke my head between them what are you doing  sam whats going on  laura i dont know  taliesin the rocks look a little weird i dont know  sam the rocks look weird what does that mean  taliesin it means the rocks look weird  travis they 
none	 giving you a bad feeling  taliesin theyre giving me a bad feeling i dont have a lot of bad feelings  travis lets go check it out  taliesin all right  marisha maybe theyre a trail marker  taliesin maybe its an awfully suspicious trail marker if it was a trail marker you usually  stack three stones make it look very intentional have you ever seen a painting where someone tries  to paint stars but the stars dont look right because theyre the wrong kind of random thats  the wrong kind of random  liam 
none	 i send frumpkin to go look at the rocks  laura maybe its a secret entrance to something  matt the rest of you keep looking at this pile of stones and it just looks like a pile of stones  youre like really so frumpkins heading up meowing frumpkin gets low to the grass  taliesin the random nature makes and the random that man makes  matt make a perception check for frumpkin  liam ten  matt frumpkin does a little pass around the side and there doesnt appear to be anybody in or  around them 
none	 from what frumpkin can see  taliesin all right lets go take a look then  marisha lets go knock them over  liam can he climb to the tippytop  matt sure frumpkin leaps onto the top and perches up there meowing  liam im looking down at us  matt its a strange view to see yourself walking towards yourself its like playing resident evil  1 where you have the locked camera  liam turn around  matt thats technically how shakäste sees the world when you think about it its all of  existence through a 
none	 series of resident evil camera angles the duchess man  taliesin that makes me a little sad on a fundamental level  matt well he can turn a lot better  travis getting in between the two angles and having to go back and forth  taliesin no left right left right ugh  liam having to do k turns as a person is rough  matt you all slowly approach this strange pile of rocks settled here  travis trees above us  matt no its an open field there are some trees maybe 300 400 feet off this 
dung	 part of the field  theyre small clusters four or five at a time its mostly open rolling hills  marisha are we near where the gnoll mine was  matt no youre days away that was east of the city you guys are heading south  laura did you say how tall the rocks are  matt all together probably about four feet tall  liam does it look like there is anything buried any digging done here  matt make an investigation check if you want to  liam 20  matt as you get down inside  
none	 liam sorry 25  matt okay 25 as you get down to the stones theres the one larger central stone and there are  the two ones laid against it theres a very small space in between there and you get inside and  begin to look around the ground and you feel down and theres nothing its mainly dirt and  dry brush and dead grass thats been pushed in that centerpiece you reach up and your hand  touches something  laura whispering treasure  matt it feels like a satchel or a leather sack  sam what 
none	 do you have  liam thats a bingo  sam do you need me to come  travis its just bingo caleb  laura did you find some paper  sam do you need me to touch it to disarm it  liam hold on i send frumpkin to get down by my hand to look up so that i can look at what im  grabbing to make sure that it is not one of those bags with teeth or something that i have read  about in fairytale stories  marisha oh we found a few of those 
none	 bags  laura what are you doing  liam one moment  laura caleb caleb caleb what did you find caleb  liam some loot maybe  laura pull it out  marisha what if its a trap  liam no first frumpkin goes to look so i can see what im seeing  laura why dont you let nott look  matt frumpkin crawls inside and looks up and there is indeed a leather pouch roughly the  size of a baseball that has been jammed up between the rocks to the point where its being  held up 
none	 underneath out of sight  laura is there poop in it  sam pull it out see what weve got  liam i dont like all these euphemisms i pull the bag out  matt okay as you pull the bag out from the rock it comes free  travis good fake out i like it textbook  laura open it up  travis now you die  matt as you open the bag its fine  travis too many two times  matt i dont know let me have my little fun you open inside and you already hear 
none	 the impact of a  bunch of tiny stones and as you look inside there are gems in here it is a collection of cut jewels  laura diamonds are there diamonds  matt its mostly emerald and ruby theres a lot of them and theyre jammed up in here you get  the sense immediately that this was a drop spot someone will probably be coming by to try and pick  this up  laura somebodys going to be so pissed  liam caleb takes the bag and he puts it in jesters hand and starts to quietly 
none	 dance around  laura singing we got lots of jewels here they are so pretty we should get in the cart and drive  away really fast  sam thats fine but give me a second we should make sure theres no tracks we clear all the  tracks away  laura im going to empty the jewels out and  sam oh so theyre not in that bag yeah lets replace them with other rocks and put them in  travis jester if somebody left jewels for somebody else to pick up and its full of rocks  you 
none	 might get that person killed  sam yeah but its not us  laura lets put a bunch of rocks in it its fine theyre not going to die  sam were not all good yet were trying to do good theres gray in the middle  laura theyll probably open the bag before they deliver it you know then theyll see it  liam i take one gem and say this is a sixfoot tall stack of paper were taking them  laura rocks rocks rocks  matt okay you fill the small leather sack with rocks  laura 
none	 and one little piece of dried poo that i found that was an animals  liam did you find it in your pants  laura you got to know where to look  matt follow your nose  sam should we leave a note throwing them off our track like oh you know who took this fuck  you love the iron shepherds or something like that  travis oh yeah you thought you were getting jewels but youre getting rocks and shit  laura and poop dried poop yeah ill write that  travis love the iron shepherds  
none	 liam while everybodys arguing im going to sit down and detect magic as a ritual  matt thats a ten minute casting time to cast as a ritual okay  sam im going to start going around and trying to mess up our tracks maybe leave a few deeper  footprints walking the other way  matt make a survival check  sam oh boy 19 naturally  matt nice i believe its wisdom  sam plus zero im better with other things  matt thats true yeah its not charisma thankfully you feel pretty confident that youve  managed 
none	 to erase most any sign of any tampering or movement by human beings or adjacent entities  what are you trying to do jester someone over here was trying to do something  liam oh ritual casting detect magic but thats ten minutes of stoppage  travis im walking back towards the cart  taliesin were keeping an eye out for anything else happening  marisha can you do that ritual on the cart as we drive away  matt perception check beau  liam i am busy  matt hes focusing  taliesin 21  marisha eight  matt 
none	 okay keeping an eye out it doesnt appear that theres any immediate sign of anyone  approaching by the time you finish completing the ritual you do a quick pass over there are many  magical auras around you but theyre your friends the various objects theyre wearing and  equipped light up but theres nothing beyond expected  liam nothing stones the dirt okay were good this place is clear lets get the hell out of here  matt you guys jog back to the cart get up inside and start making your way south along the  trail 
none	 again with if someone wants to write it down approximately 500 gold worth of gems  rubies and emeralds because of a really high perception check on caduceuss end  laura my notebook i dont know what happened to it when we moved so thats why i cant take notes  anymore  travis so many dicks lost to the move oh no  liam i lost all my dicks  sam our group inventory though is nonexistent right now  laura ill find the notebook somehow dont worry  sam can you be in charge again youre fired  
none	 laura you want me to be in charge of money ill be in charge of the money it reminds me of  caduceus its a unicorn ashley gave this to me  travis i think we were saying we should probably skedaddle  matt you make your way south along the trail you have one more day of travel before you get to  trostenwald caduceus are you still leading  taliesin yeah im feeling good  matt roll one more perception check  laura ill help him  taliesin oh thank you  marisha find another geocache come on 
none	  taliesin 23  matt as you guys are heading southward on the second day caduceus you notice coming up over  one of the hills a single horse with a single rider moving at a very quick speed  sam behind us or ahead of us  matt heading towards your direction heading northward  taliesin that looks like somebody on the run  laura whispering that looks like somebody whos going to pick up some jewels  marisha ooh yeah maybe thats the guy  laura everybody look casual  sam wait no were inside an invisible  
none	 taliesin im going to change my appearance to a grungy human with shaggy hair  laura i see him do that i do the same thing  matt so caleb  taliesin a long orange goatee a puffy red beard and scruffy long red hair human tasmanian devil  laura i make myself look like a young human girl with lots of freckles and big poofy red hair  taliesin we look related then  matt the two of you are at the front of the cart everyone else  marisha were hiding in the invisible cart  liam thats 
none	 how it works right everyone in the bed is  matt everyone in the bed is not visible they are held behind the illusion  laura hes driving the cart  travis i jump in the invisible part of the cart  matt as the rest of you head back into the illusion you continue moseying forward on the  cart and you hear the hooves getting louder and closer as they go screaming by you at the side  theres that moment where time seems to slow as you see that individual their face mostly covered  by a 
dung	 dark red or purple bit of cloth like a facemask a hood that is up but slipping back and  a little bit of tousled black hair with a little bit of salt and pepper on the sides a large cloak  underneath with a cloth mantle over thats also blowing behind slowly darkly dressed like a  highwayman that is in the process of trying to get somewhere quickly whether it be with a delivery  or trying to meet up with somebody in that moment you watch them glance out the side of their eye at  the 
dung	 two of you in the cart and then race off not slowing not stopping  travis dark salt and pepper hair  liam it was travis  matt i put travis in the game meta  travis you couldnt see how long his hair was underneath  matt no the hood was starting to come back from the wind as the rider tried to keep it down  travis pale skin  matt no from the little bit of face showing around the eyes it looked like it had been fairly  tanned probably from sun and a lot of 
town	 travel out in the open they took one quick but very detailed  glance towards the two of you and then screamed on ahead northward past the cart  laura youre very quick you  taliesin we do okay  matt then you continue southward for the better part of the next day you eventually can see as  you come around one bend where some of the larger hills are beginning to weave around the road as it  begins to curve left and right in the distance a number of birds are starting to fly in larger  
none	 flocks and encircling what now reveals itself to be the familiar sight of the ustaloch below you  can see ahead of you the city of trostenwald where a lot of your crazy adventures together  began its not quite dusk youre about two hours from dusk you begin to make your way down towards  the city itself its as busy and lazy as you remember as you reach the outer streets of the  township there are people coming up and down the various streets with carts and wares you can see  folks that are passing through 
none	 hopefully on a trade route some folks that look like theyre  stuck here a lot of carts that are built up on the outside that are either waiting for some sort  of sign to continue travel or are still packing up before they leave for whatever their next  destination may be what would you like to do if anything  sam are we stopping here weve got to stop for the night right  laura probably its getting late  sam wait do people hate us here ive forgotten  laura no no no i dont think 
tavern	 they do  travis we got a stern warning as we left  laura we could go see gustav  marisha yeah why dont we stop by the nestled nook  liam yeah if its easy yeah  marisha see whos there  matt you guys make your way to the nestled nook you come upon the familiar tavern entering  inside you can see the familiar face of yorda the older woman who runs the tavern and glances  up from wiping off a table in the far corner before her eyes peer over towards you from her  
none	 tousled blond hair oh hello there its some familiar faces its been some time welcome  well do sit down drinks rounds what are you asking for  sam well were in trostenwald right  liam you have a trost here thats what you do  matt trost it may be all right but youre in trost theres quite a few trostenwald brews  sam von brandt for me please  matt von brandt it is  marisha same for me  matt all right table of von brandts  laura milk for me please  matt milk for that

none	 on those fey bones of yours  matt as frumpkin begrudgingly at the command of his master enjoys a bowl of milk  sam you cant win  liam please send me your emails for abusing my fey magical cat  matt its fine frumpkin can drink milk frumpkin just has no need for it  liam yeah its like vax near the end  matt its a placebo for the master its like if it makes the master happy ill drink this  milk for you  liam yeah like vax near the end  matt yeah exactly and 
tavern	 you get the sense too that the entire time that frumpkin is drinking  from this bowl frumpkin is making direct eye contact with caleb  liam as vax oh this sandwich is so good mmm  laughter  travis should we try to see gustav tonight  marisha what time is it  matt right now its about dusk by the time youve come in the city youve come to the inn youve  got food and drinks and you settled for a bit its about dusk now  marisha sure  sam all right but before we go 
none	 over there are we going to plunk down 2000 gold to get this  nearstranger out of debt  marisha no  liam i dont think we have that do we want to do a little  sam we all do if we pitch in together im sure  liam i dont think thats true but we could do a token  sam i have almost that much  laura you have almost that much holy mo gasps you have so much money  taliesin thats obscene  sam i never pay for anything  matt yeah you guys have

none	 laughter  matt frumpkin sideeyes you while you both drink the milk together  laura you should put some chocolate in that its better  marisha great for cats  travis well we could go in the morning it doesnt matter  sam no lets go now  marisha maybe we can wheel and deal with him pay a lump sum now and consider it debt repaid time served  liam and if not i feel like we should keep a certain amount for ourselves for our travels but  we could leave a token sum to help him on 
none	 the way  matt okay so where are you guys headed  laura to the jail or wherever  matt its the stockade the stockade here is where you had previously  laura yeah talk to lawmaster norda  liam remember that norda and yorda  marisha thats right  matt yep just to fuck with you all right so you guys make your way to the stockade and it  takes a brief intro to the crownsguard outside before you are brought back in one of them  recognizes you from your previous encounter a few months back and 
none	 brings you to nordas office a  familiar place youve been norda you can see the dwarven woman with very a tense and tired and  just kind of overit expression on her face glances up at you all all right so its been a bit  marisha hi  matt well the good news is nothing else died since youve come back thats  travis excellent news very glad to hear that  matt positive so when are you leaving  sam and laura soon  matt great news thats wonderful  liam in the morning  laura not 
none	 everyone likes us  matt why are you in my office at this hour  travis were just trying to achieve one thing and that was hopefully to get some eyes on our  good friend gustav if we could  matt you want to see gustav  liam if that is permissible ja  matt sighs fine she gets up from behind the desk and goes and reaches into this cubby and  pulls out a ring of keys and follow me leads you back down into the familiar stair down below  to a cell where a couple 
dung	 of you have been held before and there you can see on the far end  there is a cell and within this dark subterranean interior with the faint burning  torchlight gives this ominous redorange flicker to the normally shaded interior you see there  slumped against the wall enjoying a bowl of some sort of gray mushy substance a not  abusedandfilthy but alittlerougharoundtheedges gustav not  chained not shackled and there is a chair and there is a bed you can see of the jail cells  here which are designed to just be abysmal this one 
none	 some pains have been made to make it a  little more comfortable  travis extended stay  liam roughly how long has it been since we were here  matt roughly about two and a half months yeah  travis how time flies  matt best estimate even a little longer im sure critrolestats will let me know but in the  proximity there norda comes up hey gustav youve got visitors clinks the keys against the  bars and oh um sorry thats embarrassing he finishes a spoonful sets it down oh my my  my i was 
none	 not expecting this at all and you can see the lanky elvish gentleman his hair pushed  back a bit greasy a bit of dirt on the edges of the face wearing the same nice long coat that you  remember him wearing when you last saw him off looks like hes been doing some hard work  probably a little thinner than even his previously thin form was but hes there he approaches the  edge of the bars by what might i have the pleasure of you all coming to see me  liam well pleasure you know 
town	 we meant to return sooner but weve been a bit held up  matt thats all right i myself have as well dont worry  liam about that were not staying in town we are leaving in the morning actually but  laura hey do you like it in this jail cell maybe its really comfortable huh  matt oh its not preferable by any means but it certainly beats going in here against my will  liam how much if its not too presumptuous how much do you have left to work off  matt oh at the rate 
none	 weve been going and he looks over towards norda nordas like if he  keeps working as hard as he has been hes looking at another seven eight months maybe  liam what about remuneration an amount what is left for him to work off  matt i have to go look at the books but i can go check  liam ja could you please  matt what you going to pay him off  liam laura marisha ambiguous noises  taliesin barter it at the very least  travis maybe just a little something towards it if we 
none	 could  matt gustav at this point leans forward and goes you are all very sweet and i greatly  appreciate it but this is my debt to pay not yours  laura and marisha well  liam could you go look up that number for us please  matt norda goes you two keep an eye and the two crownsguard approach and get a bit closer  while norda heads back upstairs gustav still pressed against the bars his head peeking through  the two sides bit of scraggly hairs falling in front of his face no but im 
town	 completely  serious this is my burden i chose it youve all done good work here and  sam caleb i lived it so i remember but for caduceus can you remind me why gustav was locked  up again  laughter  travis the circus and the fucking  sam i know but what did he do wrong  liam he convinced the town that we all met  taliesin he was responsible for the circus thats all he just took responsibility  sam but that wasnt how would he know this is an innocent man he didnt do 
none	 anything bad right  taliesin i would love to have an insight check insight check from caduceus  matt make an insight check  taliesin i want to know whats going on in there thats a counting 27  matt 27  taliesin im rolling real well today rolling high  liam werewolves next week travis willingham living his best life  sam herewolves  liam therewolves  sam werewolves  travis whywolves too many too many sorry  sam were all going to grow facial hair for next week right you too  laura yeah im going to wear

none	 sam if we can afford it no promises  laura it depends on how much is left because we dont have a ton of money  matt im just musing on how we found him and how we left him  sam which was  matt a brief star burning very bright but twice as short but no when we found him outside of the  forests up north he had no memory no voice no words he was basically a vegetable but over  time he came back to his senses and yeah its a shame he was a 
none	 good one  liam we were fond of him and he was fond of you so  matt well thats the dangers of the world we live in i suppose  travis i know youve taken this burden on yourself but i think we would all feel a bit  better if you would accept this as a small thank you for then and now as well  taliesin its more than a thank you i feel that you have to be free so that you can finally pay  your debt  matt this is me paying my debt 
none	  taliesin no this is you hiding from your debt youre a man who is afraid of what you owe i  understand thats okay itll feel so much better when youre finally free from this belief  matt i dont know who you are friend but youve stepped into a space where you have no  knowledge and trust me this is my debt to pay this is my responsibility  taliesin this is not your debt your debt lies elsewhere i know these things  marisha caduceus what the hell  travis why dont you make some tea 
none	 and shut the fuck up for a second  matt anyway i should finish my meal  taliesin itll be your last one in here  matt he goes over and grabs the bowl and quietly while looking at caduceus begins to eat  his gray mush  laura can you tell the future  taliesin no  laura can you tell the past  taliesin i just know a guilty man when i see one  laura gasps is he a guilty man  travis are we out of earshot  sam is he a bad guy  matt 
none	 you can move out of earshot  travis lets all group shuffle out of earshot  laughter  matt you bump into the crownsguard behind you oh excuse me  travis caduceus what was that where did that come from  taliesin he doesnt want to leave  laura he looks really happy in here right  taliesin hes not even happy hes hiding in here  sam well then maybe we should leave him in here if he feels unsafe on the outside  taliesin its not that he feels unsafe you can just see its all over his 
none	 face  sam i cant just looks like a dude  travis you can tell that just from looking at him  taliesin you can tell a lot from people just by looking at them  laura what do you think when you look at me  taliesin thats an entire conversation for later  laura okay  sam caduceus how will fjord how and when will fjord die  taliesin in a terrible crash  laura gasps  taliesin with a man named buick  laughter  liam yeah so back to the situation at hand you are suggesting 
none	 we continue doing what were doing  taliesin i want to see i think this is a man who needs to be free so that he can be at peace  with himself  marisha and where are you getting all of this insight  laura whispers his brain  taliesin why would you not want to why would you want to be in a cell why would you want to  stay there someones offering you freedom for nothing  sam weve been in a cell its not fun  taliesin hes putting on theres so much there hes 
none	 hiding something  marisha im not arguing prison politics  sam well lets find out how much  marisha i agree with you i just feel like theres a supernatural situation going on here  that youre not necessarily telling us  taliesin i just know i just  matt at this point norda returns coming shuffling back down with a small leatherbound  journal or book of some kind all right looking at this one keeping tabs on what hes able to  make the reparations hes made the amounts of money he was able to have brought in 
none	 from friends  to help pay the debt were still sitting at about 2100 gold pieces  sam i thought it was 2000 to start  matt 2645  taliesin i will throw some money at this  laura i dont have any money to throw at this  sam thats kind of rich for my blood  laura well i guess i have a little money to throw at this  sam if we put all of our money together how much would it be  taliesin would there be a buyout cost if we wanted to pay it 
none	 is that just the straight or  could there be some sort of deal  matt are you asking  taliesin yeah  matt what are you a buyout  taliesin weirdly and i dont know youve spent more time with him but he strikes me as a man  whos weirdly happier in jail right now than hed be out of it  matt hes fucking weird ill tell you that  taliesin i think he needs to face some stuff it would be really healthy for everyone involved  matt make a persuasion check  travis come on 
none	 you tall magical cow  taliesin thats 12  liam whispers this got weird so quickly  matt tell you what you go ahead and toss down about 1700 right now ill kick his ass out  taliesin ill put 400 gold down right now  laura i can put 50 gold in  sam no save your 50 gold  marisha how much  matt gustav has come back to the bars and is like you all are being absurdly generous  taliesin theres no generosity in this  matt and this is not necessary at all i mean

none	 headaches in here so  yeah thats one of them  marisha so were simply trying to take one more headache off of your list of a lot of headaches  were trying to do a good thing a man in jail doesnt do anything for your city but i bet 1500  right now would  travis dont have to empty the bedpans change the sheets  marisha dont have to feed him  matt the crownsguard to the left of you goes you should listen to her those bedpans are  pretty terrible  marisha think of what 
town	 you can do for this town with 1500 gold right now because let me tell  you we cant give you that 1700 so we either walk and youre stuck with a prisoner for another  nine months or you take the 1500  matt make one last persuasion check this will be at a higher dc  travis can i assist this as a charismatic fucking halforc  matt what do you say to assist her  travis oh what i just said singing listen to beau she knows the score  laughter  taliesin interpretive dance  marisha 
none	 jazz hands  matt you watch as the lawmasters eyebrow raises to the  travis and i wink  liam jesus  laura laughs oh my god  matt for the first time since youve seen norda you see a smile curl across her face she goes  if thats not the weirdest thing ive seen in some time make your check with advantage  marisha hey natural 20 yeah jazz hands work every fucking time  sam what was the other number  marisha 17  laura okay okay still good  matt 1500 and well call it even

none	 my money then  matt nott threw down a thousand  liam solid  taliesin i already knocked it off thank you nott  matt the crownsguard begin gathering the money from you guys and bringing over small chests to  put the large amount of coin over as this is happening gustav leans his back towards the  stones at the edge and his eyes are just wide in disbelief i dont know what to say  laura say thank you  matt thank you  laura i cast wand of smiles at him  matt whats the dc 
none	 on that is it a charisma save  laura its a charisma save  matt thats a natural eight  laura oh good you have to smile  matt he sits there eyes wide  laura yay hes so happy  matt norda takes the keys and heads over and opens it up all right punk youre a free man  congratulations for some odd reason these folks decided that you were worth a lot of money to not  be here so be thankful that somehow the great gods have looked down upon you and erathis  decided you 
none	 know what fuck law youre free so the guards escort him out you guys all head to  the outside you all get led outside of the stockade and norda says all right well thats  been a pleasure im going to go ahead and go home have a drink and get some fucking sleep  travis excellent idea  matt dont get anyone else killed she heads back inside gustav is stepping out there his hat  that he just had retrieved and given back to him he puts on steadies his coat grabs the small  sack of 
none	 his personal belongings and turns around to the rest of you i laughs thank you this  is more than i would have expected  liam what will you do now  matt i dont know i mean the circus is scattered i would ask where yasha was she would  be a good righthand man but i dont see her around did she also  travis no she took off like she does  liam your guess is as good as ours  marisha maybe you could find her  laura shes up north  marisha were heading to 
none	 the menagerie coast  matt huh menagerie coast havent been there in a long time  marisha youre more than welcome to hop on the wagon if you want cant promise much more beyond that  matt oh im fine thank you i appreciate it i should probably tie up some loose ends now that i  have availability to do so thanks to you and your generosity  taliesin a word of advice  matt mmhmm  taliesin whatever was keeping you in this cell whatever was making you comfortable in here be  careful of it theres something 
none	 inside you thats trying to put you in a box whatever guilt youre  feeling whatever thing that you feel that youre to blame for i would unload that burden if not  on us on somebody although were happy to take it  matt make an intimidation check  taliesin intimidation is fine i was trying to be kind of nice  matt it can ride a line  taliesin seven  matt i appreciate your candor and advice tall furry man maybe ill find an ear to bend one day  until then let gustav fletching be forever 
none	 your humble servant  marisha do you mean that like if we ever need you can we hit you up  travis its an expression  marisha yeah but im asking because he offered  matt sure ive got nothing else going on come find me  marisha i dont need you right now  matt well then come find me  marisha yeah okay  laura well send you a message dont you worry  matt im sure well good night he walks off on his lanky legs almost bending with each step  hes such a strange gangly 
none	 elf youve never quite seen an individual of his physicality  liam boy not that any of us can complain but that guy likes to lay it on thick  taliesin hes very sad  marisha fjord does this mean im not the most abrasive person in the group any more  sam i dont know if deuce is abrasive just sort of awkward aloof  travis yeah just blunt  taliesin i see funny rocks i see funny people and this is not sitting right theres something  unnatural about the build  laura when you drink tea made 
none	 of dead people you see things  marisha i toss caduceus a little pouch  taliesin i would like to make a dexterity check to see if i catch it  matt yeah  taliesin if thats okay  matt sure  sam sneezes  laura bless you  sam sneezes  laura and matt bless you  taliesin 12  matt its more of a you have to save it but you catch it  marisha thats whats left of mollys gold 65 figured since you put down so much money for a  stranger to be busted out 
none	 a little bit of reimbursement  taliesin appreciate that thats nice of you  marisha why whyd you do it  taliesin i told you why i told him why because its not healthy to sit there and just hide from  your problems  marisha thats a lot of money for an esoteric reason  taliesin is it  liam and travis yeah  taliesin how much money was it  marisha 400 gold  taliesin yeah how much is that  laura its a lot  marisha oh  laura where did you even get that gold

tavern	  travis yeah well get into it we got time  liam seems fake  laughter  matt as you guys make your way back to the nestled nook inn having seen what has become of  gustav and changed the trajectory of his journey as well you all ruminate on the rather large sum  of money youve given for what you hope is a good cause have another drink and find your way to  bed and thats where well take a break  laura you spent a thousand gold  taliesin worth it fucking worth it im

none	 the other side of failure look like  sam so i forget to turn my lower half into a  laughter  sam weird minotaur  matt its not high stakes here not high stakes here  you go ahead and meet with simon earth of the natural remedies shop you can acquire the  goods you need at the cost specifically the materials that youre trying to make if youre  trying to do something alchemical at the cost of what it requires  sam yes  matt you get through one round of discussions with him before you 
town	 begin to notice crownsguard  getting interested in your presence one of them for some reason his eye caught you strange and he  noticed something odd about the illusion and your physicality and seems to be you and this shop  dont have a very good history  travis youre half gnome and half minotaur  taliesin just the horse butt on the top  sam all right well ill just go then i guess oh looks like ive got a thing well ill come  back tomorrow and finish shopping here and i will definitely not flee town 
none	 today  laughter  matt you say loudly as you exit the facility the crownsguard are keeping a distance but theyre  definitely trailing you from about 25 30 feet behind  sam boy its a cold day i think ill just pop up my hood and walk a little brisker  matt they walk a little brisker keeping pace with you  sam maybe just oh look whats that and ill run into an alley that way  matt okay make a stealth check  taliesin natural one  sam advantage ooh thats even worse 17  matt 17 
none	 okay you dodging into the alleyway using what looks like one of the open window sills  on the first floor and the edge railing of the rooftop of this building thats immediately there  you dart up and manage to get your small goblin form up onto the roof out of the point of view  you hear the crownsguard round the corner and run inside and begin looking around you see them  pushing barrels over and one of them who seems to be leading this charge is like well fucking  hell where the hell did she 
none	 go its probably just my brain playing tricks on me and you hear  them slowly walk away they werent fully invested in a chase they were more just mistrusting and  curious  travis whispers kill them now  laughter  sam it would be so easy  taliesin whispers their families must know pain  sam all right ill just rejoin the others  matt so youre back with the rest of the troupe you guys have all your stuff gathered together to  continue the rest of this journey if you want to do anything alchemical it 
none	 will take time with the  kit to do so  sam the dice have spoken matt  matt so gathered up back onto the cart who is leading this next leg of the journey is it  continuing caduceus  taliesin im really enjoying this i get to see this wonderful countryside  marisha ill drive for a bit  taliesin sure  marisha i havent taken a shift yet  matt all right so the two of you make your way to the front of the cart and get heading  southward it is four days of travel 
town	 to the wuyun gate  marisha to the what gate  matt to the wuyun gate its the southern gates that mark the very edge of the southern portion of  the empire so go ahead and make a perception check since beau is helping you with advantage  taliesin 19  matt 19 okay well say for the sake of brevity here the first two days of travel thanks to your  tent as well and staying off the beaten path during times of rest you manage to find some good  hidden areas and no issues happen at 
none	 night during the restful period the second day goes by without  issue you do see a small grouping of merchants making their way northward with largely what is a  chain of oxen it looks like they have about 12 or so of them that are chained together and theyre  heading northward having made their way through the gates for some sort of a sale or trade its  a curious spectacle as they come by its one cart and just a lot of oxen giant horns slowly making  their way northward as you pass around for 
none	 the third day and fourth day go ahead and make  another perception check  taliesin again with advantage  matt mmhmm  taliesin all right  natural 20  travis yeah  matt damn  taliesin rocking it today  matt apparently which brings you to a total of  taliesin 28  matt 28 okay  marisha geocache geocache geocache more hidden treasure  matt as you get to the very very southern side of this valley you begin to see as the cyrios  mountains and the ashkeeper peaks begin to come and point together towards the 
none	 actual wuyun gorge  which is this central ravine between the two mountain ranges that heads southward and exits the  marrow valley entirely as you approach you begin to see the actual wuyun gates which are these  tall 50 foot high cant quite tell the width of it youve traveled through these before once with  jester before coming into the empire you know the width of these walls is at least ten feet to 15  feet wide at its base the central gates themselves are not stone but they are two very  large iron reinforced 
none	 wooden doors that stand about 20 feet tall and are opened and closed by  chained based wenches that rotate and open and close from each side of the interior of the wall  your vision catches a troupe of about 50 or so soldiers not dressed in the same bits of armor as  the crownsguard that youve seen as youve traversed most of this countryside but a  different set of armor largely bright red maroons and golds looks like there are some tents and  theres an encampment set on this side off to the eastern edge 
none	 of the gate  taliesin mr fjord what do you think of that  travis to be honest with you caduceus that was not here the last time i was here  taliesin do you recognize those uniforms  matt they are the righteous brand  travis yeah theyre the righteous brand i remember maybe a tenth of that i assume border  tensions are pretty high  taliesin are we okay with these people or should we  travis i think we should be fine after all were leaving were not entering  taliesin fair  matt as you 
none	 guys get closer and closer to the gates you can see six crownsguard that are  painstakingly inspecting every cart and travel wagon that is making its way through the gate  they are stopping one by one and going through and poking and prodding and moving things in the carts  to look for any stowaways looking for hidden materials in this time of warfare it looks like  there is a very thorough process and you can see the gates are open  liam how far to the gate  matt you guys are about 300 feet away 
none	 he caught a vision of it very distantly and you guys are  they havent quite noticed your presence yet or if theyve noticed it they havent taken stock of it  because theyre focused on their task  travis weve traveled four days to the south to the wuyun gates  sam and were about to get  marisha border patrol  sam border patrols there and theyre checking every wagon  travis you and i came through when we were coming north and there were a couple guards now theres  like 50  liam it needs to 
none	 be empty the way it looks we need to hop out now  marisha yeah caduceus lets pull off to the side and try to find some cover in the woods is there  woods to cover behind  matt nope it is  marisha its a gorge  matt well the mountain range has come together into this central gorge what was previously tall  grass plains with rolling hills and bits of rock has thinned out to be bits of scrub and then hard  rock floor youve left the central valley and youre hitting more mountainous terrain 
none	  travis perhaps we empty the cart walk on foot and say were looking to go out and bring goods  and wares back into the empire  marisha i just dont want to bring a cart with a magical tarp over it thats designed for  smuggling humans  laura well the tarp isnt magical the cart is magical  taliesin is there a way to turn off the effect  laura it just looks like a cart  liam it needs to be empty the way it looks when they poke at it so i think we should 
none	 all spill  out now  marisha well walk outside yeah  taliesin theres got to be a way to turn off the enchantment maybe  matt make an arcana check  sam is there a button  taliesin im probably not the person the make an arcana check for this but here we go  matt youre the one who had the question  taliesin nope that is a natural one which gives me a zero  matt you contemplate over this enchantment that theyve told you about the cart you guys watch as  caduceus stares out into 
none	 space a bit before this trickle of blood begins to come of his nostril  laura are you okay  taliesin what  travis caduceus youve got a little  taliesin oh yeah thats  laura does that happen when you think really hard  taliesin what  liam just on a whim do you want to try to dispel the enchantment the way you did  sam dispel but then it wont come back  laura but then it wont work  taliesin it may not come back is the thought  marisha yeah i kind of like having 
none	  laura i have dispel magic but  liam what would i know about using that spell to make this go away temporarily or for good  matt its hard to make an arcana check yourself actually  liam thats what im after that is 22  matt it depends on the basis of the enchantment if theyre very powerful items then there are  sometimes means of temporarily subduing the enchantment objects that are a little more  common or the enchantments themselves are not as thorough it is a dispel and gone type scenario  liam hey lets 
town	 roll off of this thing and take a walk  travis yep  sam how about this what about this theres were not the only cart on the road right  matt on this side of the road youre the only one there is one that is in the gates right now  thats full inspection and you can now see from this distance that caduceus has pointed out  beyond the open gates you can see a cluster of other carts theres a line trying to make their way  sam waiting to come back through we could plant 
none	 some contraband on one of those carts in the  kerfuffle theyll be like hey you you guys are arrested youre under arrest and well be  like oh well just skate through  laura i dont think theyre trying to arrest people on the way out  travis they are searching both ways it looks like  laura i think it will be easier to get out of the empire than back in  liam let them poke sticks in here and find nothing  marisha do you think were okay if we all pile out  sam if 
none	 they poke the stick in the stick will disappear  travis what kind of contraband do we have weve got a couple pouches of fungus and thats about it  marisha thats true  sam i have human jerky  laura they wont know that its human  sam if i tell them it is  laura how about dont do that  liam yeah but if they find the lot of us going grunts when they look in thats bad but if  they poke at it and say whats with this cart we say its a very good 
none	 cart  travis i agree lets risk it  sam okay  liam im getting out of the cart  laura yeah all of us  marisha if they reached in to be like oh are there hidden compartments would they see their  arm disappear  matt their arm would essentially vanish as they put their arm through the illusion  marisha or if theyre like im going to climb up and check this out frank and then theyre  like frank  laura the cart isnt covered lets just make it look totally empty  sam and if 
none	 they ask why theres nothing we have a story right were going to go pick up a  shipment and bring it back  laura yeah its fine  travis nothing wrong with having an invisible cart  sam just me ill do the talking right  travis yep  liam or maybe fjord would be good at that  laura im going to focus on the thing  travis oh the dodeca  sam shouldnt fjord  travis shouldnt i since ive never done it before  taliesin yeah actually i was going to say you havent done it 
none	 yet i think that  laura okay fjord you focus on it right as i started to focus on it you can steal it from me  liam i will take the bag away and swivel it over to fjord  travis but i dont underst groans  laughter  matt in that brief moment fjord  marisha oh shit maybe she will come to him  matt you feel this momentary release like a tether that previously had gone unseen is  loosened and there in that brief bit of unexpected freefloating freedom amongst the  darkness that warm 
none	 gray centered energy drifts towards you your fightorflight kicks in  momentarily but you consciously recall that your friends have been through this seems safe and  with that it drifts towards you and in this weird familiar sense youve had more than one  object just enter your torso as it warmly touches your chest and dissipates within the inside of your  body your consciousness shifts back out of your concentration mode on the dodecahedron and you  can feel that lingering warmth still around your sternum beneath your armor as you release your  hands from the 
none	 object  travis thats a hell of a thing  laura mmhmm  travis calm yourself jester lock it up lock it up mount up lets do this  matt all right  laura by mount up he means everybody walk next to the cart  matt so as you all walking alongside your cart towards the wuyun gates the crownsguard begin to  take notice of your presence and you can see the one cart that was being inspected at the gates is  given apparently the clear they load their materials back into it and begin making their 
none	 way  northward passing you as you head south  sam im going to change into another form of some sort  matt of which sort  sam just a halfling or a tiny halfling lady  matt you begin to hit a point and theres enough room for maybe three carts to make it  through here but theyre keeping it a twolane scenario here this pincher point there is a cart  now thats begun inspection and about three different crownsguard are going through and  rifling and lifting things out of the way as you begin to 
none	 approach the crownsguard put a hand up  and guide you over with hand signals to the area to the immediate right of it around ten feet to  the west of the other cart the captain approaches you can see a woman in brownish red  hair a bit sunbleached at the tips pulled up into a soft ponytail high on the head and the  crownsguard armor itself looks wellkept you can see from the decorations as youve seen it  before this is a captain approaches halt what is your business and where are you going  
none	 travis we are but merchants heading south down to nicodranas and port damali in search of goods  and wares  matt very well and what are you carrying across the border please  travis nothing but this cart we are full of coin and yet have no products for trade we hope to fix  that south of the border  matt whistles two of the crownsguard come over towards the cart and goes but what is within  these sacks and small boxes  laura oh no we totally emptied the cart  matt you emptied the cart 
none	 but the illusion ive explained multiple times is an illusion of  standard sacks and boxes  marisha what if none of us fully understood that  laura like at all  taliesin i did  laura i did not  taliesin may i  laura yes  taliesin theres actually nothing on the cart this is a preventative measure against theft you  can feel free to inspect the cart yourself if you like  matt make a persuasion check  sam so truthful  marisha i know  taliesin ten  matt all right appreciate you being forthright 
none	 the two other guards come forward  and you watch as they place their blades into and watch them vanish and go like  taliesin its kind of neat right  matt looking back at the captain and begin to poke forward and you watch as their torsos vanish  beyond the veil of the illusion and pull back dualla the captain approaches and herself  leans in and pulls back you are not incorrect you carry nothing on your carts this is a curious  nature of an enchantment indeed and you said youre heading to nicodranas and port 
none	 damali to  acquire goods what are you looking to acquire  travis some simple fabrics meats my friends havent sampled the cuisine down there and i was  hoping to show them a bit of the menagerie coast  matt make a deception check  travis ugh  laura if its really bad you can roll again  travis oh thats right im going to do that thats better 17  matt she gives you a close look not leaving direct eyeline to your pupils and hers and  watches you through the entire statement and then very well 
dung	 move along  taliesin we look forward to seeing you on our return  matt well the inspection will be far more thorough that time  taliesin oh i figure were not difficult faces to remember  matt all right stay safe  taliesin you too  matt the boundaries who knows whats wandering from the dark side of xhorhas there eyes on your  backs go and the crownsguard pull away and the ones on the opposite end open the space for you  guys to move your cart along with that you pass through the gates of the 
none	 wuyun gorge  travis do the gates look any different since the last time we were there scratch marks more wear  and tear  matt make a perception check  marisha youre like the one happy person at the dmv  taliesin laughs  travis 19  matt no it doesnt look like theres been any scuffle no attacks they havent taken any tear  from any sort of conflict it looks like from this end but there are more guards up along the  top along the walkway above the wall previously you guys had seen two crossbowmen 
none	 that were there  theres now ten the righteous brand themselves while about 30 or so of them have been encamped in  that one encampment the rest of about 20 or so are scattered amongst different points on the  mountains around the gate and are all scouts keeping eyes out for anyone trying to circumvent  the pinch point theres pretty heavy interest in keeping watch on these borders given the current  conflict to the east but you pass through safely allowed by the crownsguard and within a few  moments you pass into the wuyun gorge 
none	 proper and a wave of acknowledgement hits most of you that  for the first time you are no longer in the dwendalian empire so you pass by the six or seven  carts that are in line and theres arguments and frustration some of them are currently very  vehemently arguing with the crownsguard who are holding them to wait their turn you keep your  heads down and continue forward there you start heading into this large mountain pass extremely  steep at certain points where the mountains seem to be have been carved down or bisected by 
none	 some  ancient cataclysm whether it be the calamity or some great natural disaster long before that it  seems to be a very unique singular cleft down in the center of these two mountains that breaks the  mountain range between the cyrios and the ashkeeper whos keeping youre at the front of this  taliesin mmhmm  matt go ahead and make a perception check for me please  taliesin no advantage  sam come on deuce drop that deuce  taliesin thats a 27  liam he did it again  taliesin i am rocking today  
none	 matt as youre stalking ahead riding before you can see theres bits of rock formations that have  been pushed through by some sort of ancient seismic activity there are pieces of rock that  are platformed over and there are outcroppings and caverns that have naturally been pushed out of  the sides of this large ravine its quiet here with the occasional echoing sound of birds  squawking and cawing to each other theres a faint wind occasionally drifting through in  pulses its warm the sun is above and whereas previously you have been encountering the colder 
none	  winter especially further north of the marrow valley where the snowfalls have been rather  consistent the warm clothes that many of you have been wearing in that weather are beginning to  capture the heat of this southern area and as the sun is now high in the sky cloudless the blue  above you the beads of sweat begin to form across your back beneath your clothing caduceus you  hear this faint guttural muttering of some kind what languages do you know  taliesin i know common elvish giant sylvan  matt laughs  sam more 
none	 whispers  laura ah he knows everything  liam its an elven giant  travis buddy  marisha caduceus mvp tonight  sam wow hes on a roll  travis may this carry you into the playa well my friend  marisha yeah  sam what was that i heard some of the whisper i heard it was crazy  laura what  taliesin theres giants up ahead  liam and marisha what  sam what do you mean  laura where up ahead  taliesin shh  sam you didnt tell me we were going to giant  travis 
none	 shh  laura get back in the cart get in the cart  taliesin all right do i know where the voice came from  matt with that roll yes you would looking ahead and you guys have traveled a number of  hours past the gates about 30 feet ahead of you behind one of these rock formations you can see  the vague outline of some sort of large hulking figure leaned against it  taliesin okay  matt you see the outside of a humanoid shoulder and the back of a matted bit of greased hair  
none	 maybe standing 15 feet tall  taliesin all right  laura what is it  taliesin its about 30 feet away  matt its about 30 feet ahead of you and to the right  taliesin all right i think hes planning on ambushing us  sam what  taliesin im going to cast  laura just one  taliesin just one i can see although hes talking to someone im going to cast calm  emotions over there just to see what that does  matt okay  marisha just a little chamomile its calming a little lavender  
none	 taliesin its a 20foot bomb in all that section i cant see  matt yep so its a charisma saving throw  taliesin against 16  matt its a natural five with a minus one thats going to be a no  travis atta boy  liam nice tal  laura whos this tal you speak of  matt the tension and you guys can as caduceus has pointed out this figure you can see it tense  against the stone and you see it was reaching down just out of sight there was some large  rocky formation that 
none	 it had its arms on and it leans back a bit and shakes its head and as it  pulls just beyond the outline of the rock you can see a second head right next to the first two  heads on one set of shoulders they both shake away from each other then together and away and  one looks to the other and just waves in your direction  taliesin what are they wearing  matt mostly no clothing other than a bit of tattered leather and hide and furs that are matted  around the midsection and 
none	 dangling almost past the knees  taliesin im just going to calmly keep moving the cart by them and im just going to wave back and  say thats some great leather youre wearing there you look great  travis are you fucking kidding me  marisha holy shit  matt as the cart moves past another voice also in giant comes across the way you guys hear  yelling in giant you look over to the other side and from around another rock you see  another one of them whos looking livid at the other one go ahead 
none	 and make an arcan this would  be technically its a giant  taliesin they also dont see any of you they just see me and whoevers sitting up front right now  matt make a general intelligence check  laura oh thats right its just you i think all of us jumped in the back  matt if anybody would like to make a general intelligence check on this  liam 23  sam or just him  marisha general intelligence  matt yeah these are ettins  travis that worked theyre what  matt ettins are large giantkin 
none	 twoheaded beasts and they dont normally work in pairs  you know this instinctively because they argue enough between their two heads to have two  working together is already a very strained relationship and the other one whos yelling at  the one across the way as you guys are in between you recognize it as saying what why  stupid right there dont wave and the other head goes what he said im going to go ahead  and just for the sake of this to give you some visual perspective  taliesin yeah please bring it i 
none	 feel bad that we didnt get to  matt it may not come to that but i want to give you a visual  taliesin i feel like if you worked so hard on a map i was feeling a little guilty  sam matt made this map and you just blew it taliesin  taliesin i am enjoying this character so much  laura oh my god look at how amazing that map is  sam theres so much in there  liam oh he worked so hard on that  sam you know lets just attack just cause 
none	  liam and now the ettin just wants to crochet things with us  matt so you guys would be right about there  laura look at our beautiful horses how come one mamma mia is way prettier than dancing queen  sam yeah  matt all right so general positioning caduceus would be in the front with jester there  laura oh okay i was inside but ill take it  taliesin im so tall all right  matt or no was beau here in the front  laura all of us were in the back except for taliesin 
none	  taliesin i think it was just me at this point  matt there you go thatll work there well say youre in the cart there haphazardly  taliesin yeah because you guys can see this whole thing  laura look at your little mini your minis so pretty  taliesin isnt he isnt he pretty  travis yeah we havent seen cadeceus yet  sam and laura whoa  laura those things are huge  marisha oh my god oh goodness  matt and so this is the one that came around this end  sam they really have 
none	 two heads  matt they literally have two heads  travis thats fucking awesome  liam that miniature is like the garbage pail kid card that you get 97 of it is the most frequent  find in the box  marisha ettins  liam ettins got a lot of ettins  matt so this one currently under the calm emotions which youre concentrating on the other  one is yelling at it monster yelling pointing at you and the other guy is like confused  monster yelling  taliesin i can understand this too and im going to chime 
none	 in a bit i think its really  unfair youre just putting this all on him i think you really youve got to chill out a bit  i mean you seem like a nice guy youre really listening to this god im also still very  gently still moving forward  matt okay  taliesin you guys have got issues man  matt pushing slowly forward trotting along that way this guy comes out and begins arguing loudly  with the other as he comes forward too shouting at him and theyre both yelling over both of you now 
none	  marisha oh my god just keep this going  taliesin language come on  matt you shut up you no hun you speak same  taliesin yeah man who doesnt speak giant thats just rude  matt and the one who you didnt cast it on is like you so dumb you two not listen ruin this  taliesin i dont think youre dumb and im just still going giggles  matt you push ahead a little bit further  sam oh god  liam in the meantime i pull out a white feather and i trace a triangle 
none	 in the air and i cast fear  on this one  taliesin bless you  matt and whats the saving throw on that one  liam 16  matt that is a natural 13 and whats the wisdom save  liam 13 is the dc  matt its a wisdom save you said yeah thats a failure so that one  travis what the fuck  taliesin wizards man  matt goes from arguing and goes like well fine you wont finish this we do it ourselves  and they reach over and grab this large boulder and begin 
none	 to pick it up and at that point caleb  finishes his incantation and they go boulder crashing noise drop it monster screaming and  just start running the opposite direction as the cart begins to slowly roll forward  laura this is great  matt begins charging off this way  travis oh my god  taliesin stay all right my friend you stay all right  liam i tap nott on the shoulder  taliesin dont let anybody tell you what you cant do  liam those two just saw their worst fears  sam wow that was 
none	 incredible  matt this guy just turns around and begins to like waves back to you and heads around that direction  taliesin its not a concentration by the way  matt calm emotions is  taliesin calm emotions for me is not doesnt is not a concentration no yes it is youre  right never mind i dont know how to read spells yet  matt thats okay it also only lasts a minute  taliesin yeah so you know weve been rolling  matt so these guys both run off the side there  taliesin yeah were going 
none	 and now im booking  marisha and travis wow  taliesin boom motherfuckers  marisha awesome fucking awesome  matt so as you guys continue running  liam its so beautiful  marisha we used it kind of  liam wait now he can spin it around and its a different part of the canyon entirely  laura cool  taliesin and you have to turn the little marquee again  liam 100 feet later  laura he already did it he already did it  sam and now were in a totally different place  liam this is like 
none	 old animation where it just repeats and repeats and repeats  matt kind of yeah so as you guys continue pressing forward on this path  sam and laura oh no  matt the rocks destroy you  marisha theres a rock slide you guys  liam the ettins are throwing boulders at us go go go  sam caduceus that was amazing  taliesin wed better run  sam and caleb even better  matt so the horses moving forward at a  taliesin i tell the horses were going fast  matt all right so make an animal 
none	 handling check because youre now going into a straight just go for it  taliesin animal handling  matt yep  taliesin 21  sam jesus  matt without issue you horse speaker caduceus clay give them the intent to go into a gallop and  they begin picking up loudly and you hear the kind of soft neighing as they begin galloping  forward the cart taking up speed at which point you hear a voice behind go hey wait a minute  taliesin the jig is up  matt and you see as the one with calm emotions 
none	 begins charging forward is it a saving throw on  fear every turn  liam i assume it is yeah yeah where did it go where did it go this is my first time casting it  marisha one minute  liam if the creature ends its mumbling must take the dash action if a creature  sam singing with the music  liam for the duration it just says it becomes frightened for the duration  laura how long is the duration  liam one minute  sam doesnt say theres any saves  matt its concentration  liam 
none	 im looking where is it do you see it  marisha no if a creature ends its turn in a location where it doesnt have a direct line of  sight on you  liam oh if it doesnt have line of sight on me it makes a wisdom save  matt right so it fails the first one succeeds on the second one so itll be three rounds in it  gains it back which is just about the time it would take for the calm emotions to fade at this  point so at this point as you 
none	 guys are running forward at a doublespeed here moving forward  horse speed pulling the cart though its only going to be about half of that actual horse speed here  marisha ill go ahead and hop out and try and give the horses less weight to pull and run alongside  matt okay so beaus now charging alongside there the rest of you are pushing forward kind  of going in that realm at which point this ettin comes charging around the corner there no longer  affected by the calm emotions and you can see the other one 
none	 is rushing up behind going you  stupid were supposed to work together and the one to the left goes like i told you we  shouldnt work with more than one and hes right off to the side here beginning to give so i need  everyone to roll initiative now  groaning  taliesin there we go  matt oh wow and sharp inhale theyre rolling good initiative on their end all righty so 25 to 20  sam 24  marisha 23  liam noice noice noice  matt 20 to 15  taliesin  liam 16 
none	  matt all righty and then we have  marisha caduceus then caleb  travis yep or either way  matt all right 15 to ten  travis ten  matt oh no  liam jester voice jester where did you land  laura i landed on six  liam aww  laura it is a sad day  matt sorry jester all right so nott youre up first theyre now like heavy footfalls running  sam how far is the closest one  matt they have a battleaxe in one hand thats half made out of stone with a 
none	 giant piece of  splintered tree wood thats been wrapped around it with rope in the other hand they have this giant  club from another piece of what looked like a dried and dead tree that still has bits of root  and chunks of rock jammed in the side of it and they both heavy footfalls charging towards you  one heads looking at you and the others just looking up at the air at a bird that flies  overhead it looks a little spooked scared grunt so what are you doing  sam how far is 
none	 the closest one  matt the closest one to you because youre technically in the back of the cart right here  laura technically youre in the back of the cart  matt yeah hed be about 35 feet from you  sam snarls these fucking things  taliesin you can hold  sam i know because im hidden from their view right as far as i know  matt as far as you know yeah they dont know youre in the cart  sam hmm  matt fjords in there as well  sam yeah i guess ill hold 
none	 i mean otherwise i have to shoot at it at disadvantage eh ill take  a shot at disadvantage im hidden though  matt you are so it doesnt know youre there so you have advantage so its just a single roll  sam doh thats a ten  matt ten misses it goes wide out of the side and the head that was watching the bird goes  growling and peers closer to the cart with an untrusting eye its chin tilted to the side this  is a terrible look now you see these very bulbous faces that 
dung	 are a combination of muscle and fat  pushing into the eye sockets they have these tiny beady giant eyes you see these roundish  pushedin pug noses and this large gaping jaw ogrelike with two big tusks that protrude from  underneath long scraggly dark beards that pour down the sides of their face and over the front of  their chest mingling with matted bits of chest hair over this tanned and sunweathered flesh  uncovered made of sheer muscle and anger you can see each head has its own series of scars and  weird personality and 
none	 as theyre running theyre still arguing with each other as theyre in the  process of getting to you we need to go from the side no direct attack on this end the other  one goes like budak dont be stupid the other heads like but budaks our friend shut up  that the end of your turn nott  sam i can bonus action fire again or i can get off this cart of death that theyre going to be  swinging at pretty soon ill just shoot again oh boy 17  laura thats good  matt

none	 the left the one that was being referred to as bodak  sam bodak  matt budak  sam budak  matt as it hits goes gargling and starts reaching up with the hand thats holding the club  to try and pull the bolt out while the other head goes come on put your weight into it and just  keeps charging forward that end your turn nott  sam yep  matt all right beau youre up  marisha are the horses still going to move on caduceus turn  matt the horses move at initiative count 20

none	 natural 19 wisdom save  taliesin dex save  matt dex save oh thats a 18 still makes it though so no effect unfortunately it sees it  coming and ducks out of the way and the burst of divine energy explodes in the middle of the air  to no effect thats your action  taliesin thats my action yeah thats all i got  matt okay its now their turn the two ettins rolled a 15 and a 14 initiative this one here is  going to go ahead and just run past its going to go over

none	 bits of rock and dust off to the side the two other ones slam into the sides  of the ettin whos currently trying to find its way up but it has no ability to move its muscles  its body still tense from the stunning strike which actually would have given him advantage on  the attack because hes stunned  marisha so it would have evened out  matt yeah i forgot that so roll one more roll for the first one  liam its a two  matt first one still misses there you go as the 
none	 flames burn and begin to ignite elements or at  least singe bits of the furs and leathers that wrap around its midsection its still desperately  trying to get back to its feet that ends your go caduceus youre up  taliesin first thing im going to do is im going to tap my staff and say time to get out  children im going to bring a little nest of creatures right on the back of his business right there  laura like onto his wenis  taliesin well they get everywhere its a swarm  sam you

none	 the ground come to  close as the body sloughs a bit off of its tightened structure you watch quickly as where it  normally was very rocky terrain bits of green begin to emerge vines seem to slowly wrap up over  parts of its dead form and within bits of the wounds that you guys had left in it from your  various hacks and attacks against its body you see bits of reddish fungus begin to pop out and  fill the various wounds nothing too intense it begins the process  taliesin im going to take 
none	 a handful and give it a smell sniff mmm look at that hes useful  now thats good thats so good  laura blood fungus  taliesin ah im going to go get back on the cart  sam is there anything on the giants body worthy of stealing  matt make an investigation check  taliesin oh man dig your fingers into it  sam 24  matt 24 you loot through his body  laura ew  matt you find eight gold pieces 34 silver pieces and half of an eaten goat that was  dangling from the 
dung	 back of its belt  sam ill take that  taliesin goat meats great  matt well its great when its fresh you can smell the week of ripening that this halfgoat has  been through  taliesin theres a lot of medieval cooking that would want the meat to get a little gamy im just  saying sometimes it improves the flavor  sam i flick off some of the beetles off of the goat meat thats mine get off  matt the beetles eventually recoil back into the staff so you guys gather yourselves back up into  
none	 the cart keeping a very close eye on the rest of the walls of this gorge as you continue your  journey you push beyond this brief encounter so its about four and a half days of travel to nicodranas  sam from here  matt from here  sam jesus were going halfway across the world  matt youre traveling a long way man  liam how long did it take for caleb to come out of that  matt it took about a minute  liam a minute i should probably stop doing that  marisha straining ugh 
none	 can i set you down now  liam okay  marisha im going to set you down now  liam okay lets go catch the cart  matt you guys rush up and hop into the cart continuing your journey for this next day or so  caduceus make a perception check for me please  laura ill help you  taliesin thank you  matt with advantage with jesters aid yes  taliesin lets try a new die oh thats not bad thats a 17 itll do  matt all righty keeping an eye out you peruse the interior 
town	 of the gorge for the remainder of its  length eventually the mountain gives way towards the end of your days journey you dont notice  anything waiting in the wings on par with what you had seen before there are some mountain wolves  that wander down in a pack that notice your presence but dont seem to bother they tend to  avoid the main road at this point eventually you make your way past the dry rocky plains just as  the sun begins to set you can see to the left of you the ashkeeper peaks 
none	 that continue to curl off  to the horizon the hills growing taller and more scattered across the plain in front of you to  where you cant see beyond the first set but the landscape seems to be dipping a bit beyond that  so each hill itself marks the horizon ahead of you for however long you have to travel first night  rest as you were keeping watch no major issue as the morning comes to you all begin to wake up  to the sound of approaching hoofprints  liam a thought i had earlier point 
none	 of order the first time i did the hut it was bright  orange but ive learned that i can control that so through experimentation i would say if we are  ever in a field of grass the hut would be the color as close as caleb can get it to the grass  it wouldnt be mottled or anything it would be still slightly abnormal because it would be one  solid color if we are in a stony area i would try to match the gray just something i add to my routine  matt easy enough 
town	 as you guys come to and wake up off the side of the main path you glance over  to the right and you can see from the sound of hoof prints two carts 30 or 40 feet off the  side heading up the road at the front you see a i wouldnt say cloaked but hooded man with a  head wrap that falls into a scarf over one shoulder a long grayandgold set of comfortable  travel robes sat at the front whos looking over in your direction in the back of the cart you  see 
none	 numerous sizes of metallic cages of some kind  laura are there people in them  matt make a perception check  sam its a zoo its a traveling zoo  laura 19  matt 19 no people you do see a number of creatures little animals  sam its a traveling zoo  laura what kind of creatures  marisha maybe its a petting zoo  matt at this distance you can see a number of small feathered winged creatures on perches on  the inside of one cage you can see on the back cart just from this 
none	 distance you cant make out  too much from this but you can see two small furred creatures that are both circling each other  in the cage in the back  travis lets go take a look  marisha is he stopped or is he moving  matt hes moving just glancing over and noticing this weird green dome off to the side  travis call to him  marisha good day  matt do you emerge from the dome  marisha mmhmm morning  matt good morning  laura do you have animals in there  matt yes 
none	  laura did you are they nice  matt they are very nice they are very young and they are ripe for finding someone who would  wish to give them the attention and training they deserve  laura gasp wait wait wait can we pet them  matt no but you may look to purchase if youre interested  laura okay i run over  travis look to purchase jester just look  taliesin i got to see this im getting up  marisha i go over as well  matt you all begin to walk over as you 
none	 all begin to approach hes like whoa pulls on the  reins and the horses come to a stop you look and its one man this gentleman as you approach  hes heavierset with very tan sunweathered skin the folds of his neck just barely peering  past the wrap over his neck but he seems relatively positive and jolly when you approach  hes got this smile and his eyes are very welcoming there are two other figures that are  walking alongside the cart that appear to be keepers that are just keeping an eye on the

town	 see the massive green  jungle this tangled jungle forest to the east that consumes the base of the ashkeeper peaks all  the way just out of sight to the horizon known as the cuarasca jungle the fields and hills you  follow grow darker and more dense with greenery the sky is more clear and a more vibrant blue than  youre used to in the northern lands and the grey skies of the empire you follow the road over a  series of rising hills until you eventually crest the tallest your eyes catching a beautiful and 
dung	  for some of you an entirely new sight beneath the cloudless blue the horizon comes to meet an  endless stretch of deep cerulean scattered with thousands of tiny sparkling lights the sunlight  dancing across the distant waves giving the illusion of a million scattered diamonds glinting  across what is the lucidian ocean to your left the dark green of the cuarasca jungle still  dominates the countryside along the ashkeeper peaks the now hundreds of miles of lush tangled  vine canopy stretching to the shore and stopping at the southern cliffs and beaches that give 
town	 way  into the endless waters a warm breeze blows from the south as the faint scent of salt water tickles  your nose due just south of your hilltop southwest the road continues to wind through the  green hills and patchwork rocky mounds dotted with trees and overgrowth eventually leading to a  rather large city that sits on the coast dozens of boats large enough to see even at this distance  cluster around the bays and docks while the colorful rooftops and towers vary in height and  design giving an eclectic visual of a jumble 
none	 of cultures having built this space without unified  vision to fjord this is a familiar sight and to jester this is home welcome to the menagerie  coast and the port city of nicodranas and thats where well finish tonights episode  cheering  travis plus three animals not one maybe two  taliesin a very special episode  marisha why did we do that  laura i dont know  marisha i dont know why we did that now weve got to think of a name  travis ten extra legs now  liam yeah here have some
