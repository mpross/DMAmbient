/none/ matt everyone welcome to the new episode of critical role  this evening we luckily have ashley johnson  back in as her character pike  unfortunately laura bailey will be gone for  most of the game possibly she might come in  cause shes busy recording a show with wil wheaton  its gonna be a great show but well miss her  until she shows up  however we shall see what the next chapter has in store  in just a moment  in the meantime  lets go ahead and get you situated with the /none/ character backgrounds  travis right listen up  if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite for the two  great loves in his life  combat women and ale  record scratch  wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge  of shapes colors and giggles shiny things  but also ale  in his early years armed with his two handed gray axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might /none/  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon  an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods  he objected to the killing of such an innocent life  a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this  this terrified little thing  his disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader  his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd  it was then that the relative of the very gnome  he fought to save saved him  it /none/ was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging  entire taverns to wrestling matches  or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house  where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth  would leave you with little information  on the halfelven druid  you might even think that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet  of /none/ course it would be unwise to underestimate her  based on first impressions  thunder clap  under that unintimidating petite frame  is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest  of champions pee their pants  literally  giggles  born to the air tribe of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature  and the elemental magics  it is her peoples inherent duty  to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes  begin to bleed /none/ with this realm  since she was a little girl  she had quite a knack for air manipulation  and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels  to be little beasts  which i do  anyways  it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe  her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities  and she was inveterated to succeed him  as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly /none/ high expectations  every druid leadertobe must embark on a journey  to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready  he set her on the path to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stilben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente is proving yourself  a strong warrior a valiant protector /none/  and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge  one thought plays in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children  born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone  with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship  percy turned his attentions to the sciences  engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple  named lord and lady briarwood came to court  during a feast held in their honor  /dung/ the briarwoods violently took control of the castle  killing or imprisoning everyone  who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon  only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men  as they ran percys sister  took several arrows to the chest and fell  percy kept running  eventually jumping into a freezing river  and floating unconscious to freedom  he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered the next two years  as he slowly /none/ made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance  against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  gunshot  sam oh you havent heard  of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eyes on you  a talented musician master of disguise  and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much  as he sings his own praises  born /town/ a poor gnome  scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice  to croon for coin and support his single mother  one day he was discovered by a half orc promoter  and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troop  where he learned the ways of the world  and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life  scanlan has never quite come to terms  with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion  while his years on the road provided many /none/  shall we say educational experiences with the opposite sex  deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first  performer second and fighter a distant third  on the battlefield hell support his allies  but rarely draws blood  unless its to protect fellow gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh  a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye  that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  sputtering  orion greetings and /town/ salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called tirex  located in the heart of draconia  born from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers right  showing prodigylike control of my magic  the judges in the draconian high council  were amazed at how powerful my spells were  for how long i had been training  at 20 years old  i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild  in draconian history  for the next few years i /none/ almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member  as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas  around the known world  for months i would frequent the chamber  and learn of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research  i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council  and was told /town/ that all of the information  in the chamber i stumbled upon was either believed  to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries  and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse  and managed to convince the city council  to lend support in me leaving draconia  on a mission of peace and diplomacy  for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends  and allies in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn  i had /none/ quite the task on my hands in that respect  but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that  sputtering  i am much sharper than most give me credit for  i just dont pay attention to things sometimes  ive also been known to be rather cunning  loyal happy go lucky and well dangerous  i cant help but show my true scales /none/ every now and then  but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome  in the company of elves or men  vax’ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality  preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia  vax was born by a chance encounter  between elven royalty and human peasantry  raised by their mother in their early years  the twins were eventually sent off to their father  in the elven capitol of syngorn  but their cool reception /town/ among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capitol didnt last  the siblings stole away one autumn night  and set out on the open road  after a few years of wandering  they eventually decided to return to their mother  and journey back to the lands of their youth  but instead of finding their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone their home burned to ash  pressing the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day the dragon came  roaring /none/  with their ties all severed  vax’ildan and his sister set out  to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned  to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  drawing blades  the way of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many half elves  vexahlia has spent most of her life  suffering the cool reception of a people  who /none/ dont fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vax’ildan  quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on  in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two  were taken from their mother  and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father  was an ambassador  he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance /none/  and after too many years of disdainful looks  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets  and learning the ways of a thief  while vex kept to the woods  she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer she learned to hunt  and to track to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion in the form of a bear  her own stolen trinket to fight along side /none/ her  and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable  and gives expert massages  travis right listen up  if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite  for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale  record scratch  wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge  of shapes colors and giggles shiny things  but also ale  in his early years /none/ armed with his twohanded great axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon an unsuspecting  elderly gnome in the wood  matt welcome back  unfortunately we dont have pikes video ready yet  im working on it

works in video games  gave a talk at gvc this year and it just went online  and not now but later you should watch  alex jaffes talk on metagame balancing  its really really fun its fabulous  and you learn a lot  matt there /none/ you go alex jaffe look it up  marisha alex is brilliant  matt all right guys so getting to the game at hand  so little overview for the story  the party has been sent to the city of kraghammer  through a friend of theirs named arcanist allura vysoren  a good friend of hers and a folk hero  throughout the land known as lady kima of vord  whos the halfling paladin of bahamut has gone missing  she went on a vision quest  as part of a pilgrimage shes been on for the /dung/ past year  and sensed a dark evil brewing  far beneath the city of kraghammer  disappeared into the city and hasnt been seen for weeks  so arcanist allura asked the party  hired them essentially to go and see her whereabouts  upon getting to kraghammer  they interacted with some of the local characters  eventually found theirself talking  to lord nostoc greyspine who owns the mines at the very bottom  of kraghammer proper  after a brief encounter with a mutated abomination  of a naga creature  they were then hired by /none/ lord nostoc to go into the mines  find whatevers creating these abominations  destroy whatever is the source of them  and he will pay well and also pay for each  creature head that is brought to him individually  after getting into the mines  a few battles ensue with some of the local denizens  couple of the umber hulks that were turned into snails  and other interesting circumstances  the party then found  what looked to be  an entirely abandoned goblin city  and a series of goblinoid corpses  many of /none/ which had bored holes in their skull  in various states of decay  they found a long bridge across an open chasm  upon traversing it scanlan went invisible  and found what looked like a duergar war camp  which are like ashyskinned evil dwarves  that live deep underground  watched a dwarf get executed by what appeared to be  some sort of strange alienoid creature  that was revealed to be an illithid or a mind flayer  a being that is psychic and consumes brains  ashley brains  matt upon returning  the /none/ party had a plan to lead them  off of a illusionary cliff that went pretty well  ended up taking out a significant portion  of the charging army at the time  vax here however got stunned on the way across  by the one mind flayer nearly fell however was saved by tiberius  at the last moment  nearly lost their magic carpet but it was retrieved  ashley wait you still have the magic carpet right  matt yeah it got recovered barely  marisha we got it back its okay  travis not thanks /none/ to some  matt laughs  after brief discussion keyleth and vex  decided they didnt want to listen to anyones bullshit  and hijacked magic carpet  flew down into the chasm below  and discovered behind one of the underground waterfalls  some sort of a  mind flayer who was cast out from the society  covered in rags kind of a twisted physical form  and after a very tense discussion  seemed to befriend it under the guise of  mutually agreed retribution against those that are oppressive  to this whole chasm area  /none/ marisha clarence  liam and sam clarota  matt clarota i dont think hell take kindly to clarence  however this is where we left off the previous game  ashley so nervous  matt as you guys have gathered up  and youve finished your luxurious song  to try and ease his torn form  he finishes tapping his toe in spite of himself  looks about the rest of the group and says  once again not vocally  but speaking directly into your mind  through a horrifying whispered voice  that you cannot even close /none/ your ears to get rid of  i think its best we rest out of sight  he points across the chasm  to the war camp that is looming across the way  he begins to dart off towards the abandoned  goblinoid village  orion i guess we should follow him then  sam yes thats wise  taliesin i think thats a great idea  sam we follow  taliesin no nothing can be there  matt as you guys make your way in toward the goblinoid village  you can see clarota who is genuinely hovering /town/  about a foot off the ground  and kind of just coasting around in a very creepy way  finds one tent opens up and looks inside  here here we can talk  darts inside  travis we follow  sam we do follow yes  matt as youre following  travis oh crap  sam oh god were dead  travis why  why would he touch his dice  were gonna die  matt as youre following towards the center of this town  you see in the distance a small light moving  back from /town/ the direction where you first saw  that duergar camp where grog was assaulted  travis i dont recall that  liam look back the way we came  theres some sort of light up ahead  orion that cant be good  liam stay with clarota im gonna go take a look  scanlan come on  sam im coming with  matt both of you guys roll stealth  travis ill stay outside the tent if somebody wants  to ask him how to get a magneto helmet like his  all laugh  cause im gonna need /none/ that  orion ill talk to him  sam its just a roll not great  nine  liam 29  taliesin thats a number  matt so as you  officially vanish into the ether and surrounding darkness  scanlan who still has that song  stuck in his head from earlier  his slow jam is just laughs  abstractedly humming to himself without realizing  and calling a little bit of attention  at which point you began to hear some footsteps  in the distance that come to an immediate halt  liam grab scanlan put /none/ my hand over his mouth and say  quiet man whats wrong with you  sam its a nervous habit im sorry  all laugh  liam with great power comes great responsibility shut up  sam its a gift i have to share with the world  liam later later  save it for the mind flayer  so with him tucked under my arm like a football  i start to creep further  and try to make out if theres light from the lantern  i can see in dim light thanks to daddys blood so  /none/ im gonna try to figure out what it is exactly  that im seeing  matt go ahead and make a perception check  sam i also have low light vision  matt you can make perception check with disadvantage  because youre under his arm  liam perception check oh  sam nope  liam do i have any advantage on that  matt no liam 11  matt all right  actually directly looking in the direction  of that duergar camp earlier  you can see behind a pillar thats blocking your view  its obstructing your /none/ view of the actual camp proper  you can see some movement in the light  you hear some shuffling it sounds like plate  you hear a voice just kind of muttering to itself  a familiar female gnomish voice  liam pike  ashley hey guys  all laugh  ashley its me pike  liam jeez where have you been  ashley oh man ive had quite a time  ive missed you guys terribly  a lot has happened  im sure for you guys as well  sam not so much  orion i say /none/ into my thing scanlan what the hells going on  sam dont worry its a friend well bring her back soon  orion okay well theres a mind flayer here  sam keep him busy  he likes slow jams  orion right right  matt as you guys take a look at pike  you notice shes fully armored but dirty  shes got sweat across her face  looks like she may have had a couple scuffles  on the way through here  ashley i did  matt shes got a wild look to her eyes  /none/ sam oh my god  matt genuinely relieved to see you  pike youve managed to come down here  through the front of the mines  which for the most part have been clear  you follow what details you can after asking around  and discovering that the rest of your party  had ventured below without you  youve followed the tracks best you can  and are glad that you at least chose the right path  and ran into them before you ran into something far more dangerous  what you were inspecting was this /none/ campsite  that appeared to have been abandoned  what caught your eye was against the stone wall  right above the ring of stones that form  the fire itself  there is a giant symbol carved into the stone  that is a protective sigil of bahamut the platinum dragon  which is a religious symbol of protection  used in different divine rituals  liam we were looking at that  we couldnt make heads or tails of it  you ever seen that before  ashley no  all laugh  matt go ahead and make /none/ a religion check  liam are you sure think about it just for a moment longer  ashley well give me actually let me rethink on this  i think maybe  marisha so wait are we all reunited  liam oh its a natural 20  marisha oh welcome back pike  travis the first roll  marisha are we all reunited  liam you just forgot  ashley i just you know what  actually now that im thinking about it  all laugh  matt you clutch your  holy symbol instinctually  as you reach up /dung/ and run your fingers along the stonework  tracing the carving across the stone  as you do your eyes close  and you feel the warmth of sarenraes presence  fill your mind for a second and for a split moment  you can see a wellarmored very driven  female halfling with hair pulled back  into tight brown braids  a dark green cloak thrown over one shoulder  whos currently carving that symbol into the stone  youre seeing lady kima of vord  the one who left this symbol  to protect her campsite as /none/ she made up camp here  you dont know how long ago this transpired  but this was definitely left by her in this tunnel  liam what is it  ashley it was left by a woman  sam lady kima  the one were trying to find  ashley yes lady kima  liam how did you know that  sam me and pike are like  travis oh jesus  sam its so great to see you you look fantastic by the way  ashley i dont feel fantastic  sam bring it in bring it in /none/ give me a hug  ooh you smell a little  i like it though  somehow it works on you  liam were in a very complicated situation  a lot has happened to us  we found sort of a war camp down here  and there is sort of a  being i dont know what to call it  hes got a little of this going on and he  speaks and lashes out through his mind  we fought a huge force down here  and then we ended up falling into a cavern  /none/ and then keyleth and my sister  found another one what are they called  theyre called  illithids  sam yes yes  and we found a rogue one  and we may team up with him or her to go back  and get revenge and maybe kick some ass in the camp  liam this just happened  he seems extremely dangerous however  the forces we faced in the other illithid  seem maybe worse so thats where were at  sam so welcome back  great sounds like a fun time  sam lets rejoin /town/ our friends shall we  ashley lets go kick some ass  sam so we trot back over to the dead goblin village  matt all right you make your way back to the tent  that was originally scouted out  the rest of the partys there waiting  as clarota is awkwardly sitting in the far end  just looking out as all of you slowly approach and enter the tent  not speaking just reactionary  and keeping a watch on all of you  orion i turn to clarota im like  ooh thats our friend /none/ pike  shes a good ally  hello pike  ashley hello everybody  all gasp pike  orion sometimes we hug as allies clarota  marisha where have you been  ashley well i had quite a time  when we were up on the tower  i noticed something  and i felt  i had to leave because i started to  have a vision  orion oh those are fun  ashley i feel like i should talk to you guys about this later  just because  sam its personal  ashley what is your /none/ name im so sorry  im pike its very nice to meet you  matt you get a better look as you approach this entity  you see what looks like a very tall  thin gauntlooking humanoid with a hood over the head  as you approach  you get a better look at the facial features  smooth kind of dull bluishpurple skin  these sunken creepy yellowish green eyes  and instead of where a mouth or nose would be  you see four slightly twitching tentacles  barely obscuring what looks like a round lampreylike toothed /none/ maw  liam pike this is clarota  weve just met  ashley can i shake his hand  matt do you wanna reach your hand out  ashley yes  matt there is no physical response  the hand is not extended but you hear  in the middle of your mind at full volume  a creepy whispered voice go  are you to be one of our allies as well  ashley yes  of course  matt very well she may stay  orion thank you very much clarota  ashley i take my hand and /town/ scratch the back of my head  all laugh  marisha i take pike and i kind of  pull her out of the tent really quick and im like  sam girl talk  marisha okay hes like a mind flayer  and we found him in a hole under a waterfall  but hes cool but he wants vengeance  ashley is that the thing is covering so he cant be  marisha hes like outcast yeah  but hes gonna help us fight all of his tribe who hates us  liam clarota  ashley do we /town/ know for sure  hes helping us  orion yes  marisha yeah  liam can you help us understand your kind  your history  how youve come to be here and who this  individual is that is fucking with your shit  all laugh  matt proverbial statement i like that  at which point clarotas eyes narrow  and you can feel just the general mood and energy  of the inside of the tent grows dark  it grows mildly  tense  suddenly you feel this presence a voice once again  fill your /none/ mind as clarota says  seven years since i discovered my curse  my form was struck with the brand of the arcane  and these foul arts proved difficult to conceal  my brethren could sense my impurity  my deviation and cast me out  i was severed from the elder brain  and chased on threat of death should i return  i wandered these tunnels in squalor  feeding on what paltry filth i could ensnare  and fleeing from the ones i could not face alone  in my wandering i discovered a duergar stronghold /none/  with a magma pool  and it proved to be a decent source of sustenance  for some time  paying off the occasional straggler  suddenly a great battle took place  it appeared something had sieged the stronghold  reading the surface thoughts of the deep dwarves  i encountered in the following weeks  i found a shift of power  whatever had taken this hold had now  demanded fealty of them  and they accepted when faced with annihilation  this entity that took the duergar by force  they called kvarn  i /none/ caught no sight of it  but the fear i could sense  from within these doors were so primal so great  that i knew to keep a distance to be safe  but four months ago one of my estranged people  was captured by these ashskins  and brought within the obsidian walls  for what i assumed was interrogation  long after the bulk of the duergar people marched  in packs through the long deep tunnels  that led to my peoples colony  and attacked  strangely before much bloodshed could occur  which /none/ i only assume was the next step in this onslaught  the fighting stopped  and the colony allowed the ash skins to waltz  directly into the temple unharmed unchallenged  where our elder brain resides  it wasnt until after i discovered whoever this  kvarn is they themselves infiltrated the temple  and somehow took the elder brain under their own control  i watched as my people had their will robbed of them  and they took the will of all the others  that lived and breathed in these tunnels  now a terrible army /none/ is forged of both factions  and they walk under the banner of this kvarn  since this ive fled back to the higher tunnels  and scrounged for materials so i could  shield myself from the iron grip influence  of the now enslaved elder brain  it took me weeks  but im confident im safe from its influence  for now  taliesin is that the thing that you wear upon your head  matt as it pulls the hood back  you see once again this kind of haphazard  metallic cluster of patches of /none/ metal  and iron this dull kind of blue metallish glow  that you can only now see once hes sitting  in near pitch darkness  as he reaches up and runs his finger along it  yes  this i feel can protect me  but i think  i think there is a way to change the tides of this circumstance  i feel that if i could somehow free my people  from the influence of kvarn  release its hold on the hive mind  my people would allow me to rejoin the colony  /none/ to be one again with my family  my brethren  liam i have a few questions is that all right  matt yes  liam you and your brethren without this  do you think as one  matt we think as individuals  but the hive mind connects us all  the hive mind gives us knowledge history direction  it is the source of our family  liam so one individual of your family sees something  the entire hive sees the same is that correct  matt yes  orion oh dear thats no good  /none/ all laugh  liam and you mentioned the arcane being a stigma upon you  matt at which point it turns its gaze away  and slinks down into its form slightly  liam what do your brethren put their faith in  if not the arcane  matt they put their faith in the arts of the mind  both understanding  manipulating controlling and devouring  orion clarota weve already allied ourselves with you  as weve already agreed  matt youll help me free my people  to be family again to belong  orion as we /none/ said yes  but the thing you wear on your head  it would make us all the more  equipped to take on this task  its against such powerful mind creatures such as yourself  i know my way around a couple arcane things  but nothing of the mind control sorts  if someone like me were to be influenced  it would be very bad for our group  even yourself perhaps  it would do well to at least maybe show us  how you built it and  you get what im getting at /none/ right  travis i would like a steel beanie as well  ashley basically where do we get one of those  matt it would take weeks to build another  travis weeks  taliesin i would like to take a look into it if possible  and see if it makes sense i am a builder  marisha maybe we can figure out  something a little bit more jerryrigged  taliesin if we were all hidden we would have a distinct advantage  travis i have a very large bronze pot in the bag of holding  could /none/ i wear that on me noggin  taliesin if you like  matt it gives you a look in response and says  this protects me from the influence of the hive mind  my preexisting connection  taliesin could we be hidden from them  would there be a way  to cloak ourselves from their understanding  matt stay hidden from the others  their sight is the minds sight  the elder brain is a collection of the once living mind flayers  of my people  liam i have one more question  and we have /none/ allied ourselves to you thats true  but im curious to know hopefully our goals intertwine  and we want the same thing  but once that is achieved and it will be  what happens then for the illithid  do you return to your home below  do your people harbor any  ambition to  move upward into kraghammer  matt it looks to the side and says  our ambition is to pursue the continuation  of our knowledgeseeking  we have no interest in the surface  we only wish to spread our dominion here /town/ below  expand our great city of yugvoril  liam im sorry what was that name  matt yugvoril  orion sounds like a lovely town yugvoril  matt its beautiful  taliesin i feel that we could come to an arrangement  liam i do as well  taliesin we would require of you at the very least  safe passage once we have helped you  reunite with your people for ourselves  and for a friend of ours whos lost in the darkness  who we are here to retrieve  matt for this deed of freeing /none/ my people from this  insidious presence that is kvarn  taliesin freeing all of our people  matt i believe this could be arranged  liam scanlan does he speak true  sam uh  lets find out  all laugh  sam im gonna just see if i can detect any lies  matt go ahead and make an insight check  sam what am i adding to this  liam insight  sam oh  13  im not an insight person  ashley oh can i  travis scoffs  liam 20 over here  taliesin /none/ what are you doing  travis shes rolled twice  ashley assisting assisting  all laugh  taliesin all of your 20s running out  matt its too late for the assist  unfortunately cause its already rolled  liam but can she suss him out  matt best you can tell those who are looking into it  he seems to be speaking from a point of desperation  and intent as he has no other option  he is genuinely  you can see it in the way he talks  and the way he speaks about his /none/ family  hes a little crazy  the isolation has put him to a point  where he wants to return to his people  and will do whatever it takes to get back with them  however he also seems to be  in a weird way that you can read  appreciative that youre willing to help  and seems to be on his part genuine  as a note musics not playing  i dont know if theres a reason for that  travis did he say his eyes the flayers eyes  are what put people /none/ in trances or their minds  sam yeah the eyes the eyes  travis so if we wear helmets its not gonna help us  sam no the helmet is what separates him from his hive mind  it wouldnt help us at all  travis ill still wear the big bronze pot on my head  matt you put the pot on your head its clunky  travis on my whole head  matt you cannot see with the pot on your head  travis no but im protected from the flayer  sam can you bore two like /none/ ghost holes in  travis i dont need it i have incredible warrior skills  taliesin do their powers work with reflection  matt no they can peer into your very mind  taliesin but if we approach them using a reflective surface  to view them can they peer into our minds  through a reflected surface  matt if they know youre there youre in sight  they can read into you  travis shit  marisha they can read our minds  matt if you are obscured unknown to them then you are hidden  they cannot /none/ sense you but if they know you are there  they can peer they can pry  liam is there any way to be hidden for us  matt hidden from sight  be hidden from knowledge  be hidden from them  marisha clarence  sorry clarota  sam how about clay  matt clarota  travis jesus  marisha sorry clarota  i just have one quick question  why would you want to rejoin your colony  after theyve banished you  why not leave  matt i have nowhere to go  they are my essence /none/ my connection  i long to return  it is the way of my people  i understand this curse i hold  i spite myself i look upon this disease and spit  but perhaps  with this deed they can overlook it  marisha youre not diseased youre special  travis oh god  sam question clarota  matt you know nothing of my culture  you presume too much  liam i think we do understand your desires though  and we can align ours with yours  so let us speak of specifics clarota  sam /none/ strategy  liam strategy  sam number one that assortment of  dwarves and some of your friends  and ogres over there on the other side of the chasm  is that something that we need to face headlong  or can we maybe surpass them  trying to find kvarn or this temple that you speak of  matt we may if you wish  their stronghold is far below  the magma leads the way  however if i know what ive seen  the general resides in that camp  i know no way within the /none/ stronghold  without the brunt of their army  perhaps the general can be pried for information  if you bring him to me  sam bring him so you wont be  accompanying us on any adventure or  matt i will be coming  orion we have to fetch him  sam and the general is in that  orion where you were right  sam yes yes  so we have to go over  ashley did you say something about a temple  or did i completely misunderstand  matt there is a temple in our /none/ city  where my people reside that is where the elder brain sits  sam well get there eventually  but first step is this smaller force across the chasm  travis yeah were gonna put the beat down  all laugh  orion well said grog  marisha you said there was a big army front  guarding this general  of duergar  sam well the generals right across the chasm  marisha oh hes just right across the way  matt their forces are gathering there the bulk of their army  currently is divided between that /none/ and the stronghold below  liam percy shot this one i think  taliesin i did  liam i think its important to point out  that your kin this general  is aware of at least three of us  of my dragonborn friend the singer over here and myself  sam i dont think he knows about me  travis no you were invisible liam just us then  orion i dont even know if he saw me  he saw my funny cards  liam true it could be just me then  orion oh i cast /none/ prestidigitation on pike and i clean her up real quick  liam you look lovely  how do you think your kin will react to that  what will their response be if they know that outsiders have come  if theyve seen just me at this moment  plus a few illusions  matt they will be prepared  so you must find another way in  you must think how to not be seen  travis think  all laugh  orion dont worry grog  matt youve never ever in your life  ever heard someone else /none/ chuckle inside your brain  but you hear within the center of yours  chuckles think yes  travis oh ho it echoes in the pot  all laugh  but i start laughing to myself silly laughter  liam can i assume that you would have already given us  any advice by now if you knew a way  are we stuck with our own resources  matt ive only watched from a distance  getting too close was too dangerous  i only read surface thoughts  if i were seen i would be nothing  i /none/ would be destroyed  liam so no back doors no secret entrances that you know of  into the camp anywhere near this general  matt none  liam fuck  travis whats in the bottom of the crevasse  sam its water and magma  travis can we pick up the little loch ness monster  and throw it at him or something  sam oh yes down below in the waters  our allies  vex and uh somebody  all laugh  found some creatures under the water  snatching bodies as they fell  keyleth  /none/ yes i forgot who went  orion her majesty keyleth  sam pikes beauty distracted me  you shouldnt have cleaned her up so nice  orion im sorry  sam anyway there were some creatures  down below in the waters  are those anything that we could use  or should we just avoid them  matt you see it actually hisses for a second  as soon as you mention this he goes  no avoid  that creature is older than all of us  it resides there an ancient mind  one that should be /none/  kept at bay  an aboleth  sam do you need a lozenge  all laugh  matt its eyes narrow once again  not quite understanding the words you use  seemingly amused  sam its a gnome thing  matt as a brief aside too  i checked the connection on my ipad  im playing music fine and the connections in the ipad  i dont quite know where its losing its connection  but i think we need some music  sam all right so lets review our options shall we  travis were gonna /none/ charge in there  sam we cant charge theres a chasm  liam how did that go with the little brain thing  not too well  taliesin the chasm is a problem  sam master switch  marisha an entire colony of mind flayers  sam we could fly in right  liam the bridge is gone we have to  sam we can fly in death from above  travis i dont know if i can  sam well we can figure out a way  enough of us can turn into flying things  to get you /none/ there  taliesin we also have a flying carpet  we can repair the bridge if we had to  at least put a rope across  ashley i think  sam or we could disguise ourselves somehow  ashley i think i know where we need to go  sam what  travis really  marisha really  liam get out of this city  marisha please do tell  sam so hold on  static  music  matt there we go  sam theres music  ashley oh wait i think i read this wrong  all /none/ laugh  sam pike dont toy with our emotions  travis you just got back  ashley so you guys havent gone to the war camp  sam we have  ashley you have  sam we been there and we quickly retreated  liam scanlan took a poke about  he boofed himself out of sight and had a look around  and then we returned to the edge of it  and i kind of flipped the bird at them  and taunted them a little  but most of us havent been in  ashley have you /none/ been to the lake  travis none of us went in the water  sam lake  no theres no what theres a lake  ashley isnt that where that thing is  travis the bottom of the crevasse right  liam under the bridge there was  sam no thats rushing water thats not  matt the area after the big drop that was at the bottom  there was a lake of water  and there was a waterfall coming out of the natural  liam and the ogres were getting sucked under by something  travis so /none/ we didnt go down there  marisha is there something under the lake  ashley well i just  i dont know if i should be talking about this  in front of him  travis we could go away from him for a second  liam he will probably hear the thoughts inside your mind  orion clarota is totally fine to talk in front of hes amazing  ashley earmuffs  all laugh  ashley well shall i share a vision i had  liam i think so pike i think at this point  we should just /none/ move forward  ashley in this vision that i had  i was pulled down toward the mines  into the tunnels below where the dwarves were working  marisha through the lake  ashley well past the goblinoid creatures  and past a great underground lake  past a jagged onyx colored fortress  framed in molten rock  travis we havent been there yet  ashley past a field of broken glass and bone  have you seen any of this  taliesin and marisha no  travis i dont think an onyx fortress  orion those last /none/ things sound terrible  liam yes that all sounds shitty  all laugh  liam the last thing weve seen is the lake  and we didnt go too close to it  because a couple of ogres fell in from above  and they disappeared like something grabbed them  travis we didnt have him fly down there and get a close look  liam no we havent had a look around  ashley i wonder if theres like  marisha i can cast water breathing on all of us  travis why dont we send one like mars /none/ rover over here  and have him go check it out  marisha i can always turn into like a whale  liam perhaps but the water breathing sounds good to me  i feel like a headon  travis isnt there something in the water  liam  run into the chasm is a bad idea  orion i pull out my empty bottle  and i go and i have this  liam yes hes got a bottle plus  weve killed a fucking dragon  i know its not an easy task to accomplish  but were /none/ pretty badass i think  we might have a good chance  marisha so wait is going through the lake gonna get us through to the general  liam well we dont know  travis we havent been down to the waters surface  sam whats the bestcase scenario  what we come up behind them  its still gonna be a fight  travis but maybe theres a different vantage point  sam we can fly over them  that seems like a pretty good attack point  taliesin some of us can fly over them  marisha well /none/ we can figure out to where where all of us can fly over them  im more concerned about us cloaking ourselves  even if were flying theyre still going to see us  sam theres an ancient death thing down there  travis he might die didnt say it was foolproof  sam i dont know man hes volunteering you  orion wait whats going on  liam i mean our options are we can vote on it  although we all know keyleth is just  gonna go fucking do whatever she wants  our options are  /none/ marisha that was one time  liam just the one time  marisha just one time  travis never to be forgotten  liam our options are a headlong advance  into the middle of their camp  thats a big fucking force  sam or some sort of disguise distraction  travis tiberius  matt is the stream down by the way  zac it goes down every two hours  and 17 minutes its been doing that for  it comes right back up  matt all right so let us know when its back up  sam /none/ two hours and 17 minutes that sounds like lost or something  travis tiberius  do it  marisha amityville twitch stream  travis go fly all the way down to the waters surface  like michael j fox in back to the future 2  and check out if theres any other tunnels  that we havent seen or ways to go  orion isnt this the same water that you bended marisha i think so  travis we didnt go down to the waters surface though did we  marisha well we went over the top of it /none/  and kind of looked down  travis oh we did we went all the way down  marisha when i was bending the water back  we were kind of in that area right  that was that area but the lake  sam do it smart  lets go bomb them  ashley what if i mean  travis can you freeze it  ashley do you guys wanna like put me down on a rope  and i can just run around see if theres any openings  i mean i have a lot of armor  /none/ liam go fishing with you  marisha go fishing yeah  ashley well no just like halfway  and then i can run around and look for tunnels  well some of us can fly so were okay  marisha i can attempt to try and drain the lake a little bit  liam and keyleth said that she can cast water breathing  can help us breathe underneath the surface  travis we have two underwater breathing potions  marisha control waters a level five spell  matt i realize that but thats a lot of water  travis /none/ but remember were slow as balls in water  liam you were having trouble if i recall  just getting the waterfall out of the way to create  i mean it was amazing but  marisha i managed to get it stopped  liam i know you fucking saved the day  but were talking about  marisha a lake  liam yeah lake superior  sam this is not just a lake  there is a death monster in there  if we go under the water were dead  travis can we stand on it  anything /none/ if we wanna fight it  or are we gonna be fighting it in the water  taliesin well we can all have water breathing  travis yeah but well be slow  sam and well be underwater where theres a death monster  travis im not worried about that part of the question  liam theres 50 to 100 fucking creeps up top  sam well then lets come up with a good plan  ashley maybe theres hidden stairs or something  like in indiana jones  travis can you electrify the water and fry the guy  /none/ liam hold up hold up  orion theres only 26 people up there  on our last count  taliesin before the ones we killed or after orion after  liam those are the ones we saw though  how do we know how far back the camp goes  how many are in the gate behind it  travis dont a couple of you have lightning  cant you deepfry the water  marisha i mean i can make a giant whirlpool  liam wait a second wait a second  clarota youve been listening to our thoughts  /none/ for the last ten minutes  sam and what clear thoughts they have been  liam what do you think  what do you think  matt what resides in that lake is  something you wish not to tamper with an ancient mind  travis blah blah blah  hodiefuckingho  matt it clouds the water with its own filth  you find yourself unable to breathe air  marisha didnt that happen already  matt its mind it takes  liam have you seen it  matt yes  liam its big  matt its rather large  /none/ ashley is it like a manyarmed  situation  all laugh  matt one could say yes  ashley okay swell  liam whats the sitch  marisha so we can face cthulhu or  little cthulhu minons seems to be our choice  orion clarota  travis why dont i have lightning i swear  cant you fry the water first see if it hurts it  sam we can fly overhead and just lightning the shit out of it  travis do that please  cause maybe theres a way theres a tunnel  and we come up /none/ behind them or whatever it was  liam that illithid took out my brain from like 100 feet  sam you know what wait wait if i may  when i was there i saw the main general  control all of them instantly  when he was about to make a sacrifice or feed  or whatever he was doing  no offense  he instantly had all of their command  if we could somehow get to him and  cut off that connection distract him  influence him somehow to command them to all jump  in /none/ the lake for instance  that would get rid of a lot of them all at once  liam can you make me invisible  sam i can get you there  i can make you unseeable but not invisible  liam what  travis whats the difference  sam i can make you a fly  taliesin may i examine without removing  may i examine your device  travis oh shit  matt make a persuasion roll  travis oh man percy percy  sam whats he doing  orion hes asking to  taliesin 16  liam /none/ whats he doing  sam touching the hat  matt he glares at you and says  our agreement does not include this interaction  taliesin it may be the key to returning you to your people  travis tiberius  orion yes  travis would you go fry the fucking lake  taliesin i wont touch i will just look  orion im reading my book  travis no i want you to  matt it kind of bows its head but does not move closer  it just slightly shows you an element of it  taliesin can /none/ i understand how it functions  matt best you can tell  it looks like a skullcap thats been kind of  decently made for what it is  but you can see some of the hammer marks on it  or whatever it was put together  it appears to be a very simple piece of metallic material  taliesin so its magic  matt it looks like it is some sort of enchantment  probably whats causing the effect  its not any mechanical device that causes it  travis metal clanging  taliesin so thered be no /none/ way to build something to create a feedback loop  marisha ooh  i see what youre getting at  taliesin i wanna try and see if theres any way that i can take a look at this  and figure out a way to build some sort  of feedback system  marisha we need to build a coconut radio  sam we dont even have a laboratory  taliesin he wants a coconut radio  orion i love coconuts  matt you have never interacted with  anything psionicbased before  the time to research that  and /none/ the materials needed to do it would take months  taliesin plan two  liam this is a fairly shitty situation  travis while all this is going on  taliesin because if they cant see  what if we blind them  liam how  marisha with some sort of interference  taliesin with a really bright light  orion oh i love doing light things  taliesin what if they are so blind they cant actually see us coming  marisha i believe pike and i both have access to spells like that  sam i assume that /none/ would make us pretty blind as well  marisha not necessarily  ashley not if we wear our  sam  sunglasses  all laugh  taliesin can i attempt to build sunglasses  sam before we build sunglasses  matt you can probably make a couple  with the materials you have on hand  you are limited when it comes to resources  as you are currently halfway underground  taliesin even better  travis vax could show his ass thats a pretty white light  taliesin thats as white as it gets  liam its pale as /dung/ shit when i go to the beach  i dont tan i stroke  sam but i thought we established that  they dont need visual contact to influence us  they just need to be able to be aware  taliesin once they have visual contact they can influence us  but they need to make that visual contact  in the first place  matt the dark deep dwarves  they hate light this i know  marisha i think itll stun them long enough  for us to get across  taliesin if we could perhaps put /none/ some light spells  on the back and the front of our shields  so that we are guarded from it  orion if you can make a pair for our friend here  that would help him out i assume  marisha wait thats not a bad idea  pike can we temporarily enchant  the magic carpet as a spotlight  as we fly over  as a light death ray  liam weve seen you surrounded in radiant light before  you think you can do that to the carpet  ashley i mean i have  /none/ marisha we should have daylight  wheres my book  wheres my players handbook  liam and clarota while theyre figuring that out  if we remain to be hidden or blind our opponents  as we approach your kin  will not know our thoughts til they see us  matt yes  they need to look into you by knowing youre there  liam can i fight one of your kin with a blindfold on  matt perhaps  travis i thought if they could see you  orion clarota  the mind hive that you possess  /none/ how close can one be before it actually affects  say 100 feet caught my friend in mid air  alas in their runin  is its range about  matt thats about the distance yes  sam you may not know the answer to this  i dont doubt your knowledge and wisdom  but i happen to have a ring with mind shielding  will that aid me in any way  matt it may  if it gives you resistance to psionic influence  it would be of aid yes  marisha daylight  travis do we /none/ have a plan  liam it wouldnt be hard to get hold of  some pitch down here some tar  sam to burn  liam no  if you can be invisible  and you have a ring of mind shielding  and you can carry a bucket of pitch to that motherfucker  you can splash it on its face cover its eyes  and its helpless  taliesin my god  sam or i can hang that big brass pot on its head  travis but im wearing that  liam yes but it could take it /none/ off possibly  if you smear sticky shit on its eyes  sam so wait i just have to blind it  liam then it cant control  sam well i happen to have a blindness spell  matt it may still try but to be blind  it would be very difficult for it to pry into your mind  sam could it still control the others though  matt probably  that is a permanent enslavement  sam so you want me to go in there solo  invisible and try to blind this thing  liam no /none/ not solo  sam im in  liam i like your idea of turning me into a fly  you and i go in  taliesin and weve got light spells  marisha pike and i can cast daylight on our magic carpet  ashley i can cast it onto my shield  and then on the carpet and we would have a double  marisha i have to take a nap though  whats that  liam but that could get us in close  scanlan and i could get in closer  and blind it and i could /none/ stab it in the head  marisha i mean technically i can also turn into  something flying  i could back you guys up  if someone else wants to take the carpet  sam we can all get there  we can all get there  marisha i can cast daylight on your helmet  on your pot helmet  travis really marisha yeah  travis that im game with  marisha all right  travis ill be like a lighthouse walking around  crushing life  all laugh  matt youd be the cover of  john /none/ carpenters the thing  liam did everyone hear percy thats a good idea  taliesin two fronts  liam yes two fronts  sam what is it  liam you and i separate from the group  they go in shining like a beacon  you and i buzzes in  and while the illithid is focused on them  we go in you blind him and i stab him in his maw  its pretty good  sam thats a suicide mission  travis i like it lets do it  liam what else are we going to do /none/  taliesin im behind this plan  sam surgical special ops seal team six  marisha what does vax have to say about this  liam vex you mean my sister vex  marisha yes that one  liam thats a good question  sam oh vex you look so tired  matt vex your sister seems genuinely perturbed  by the circumstance but looks to you and says  look i found him you deal with the situation  just tell me what to do  sam shes so like that  all laugh  ashley lets do it /none/  liam i gave up trying to understand her years ago  marisha do you know what time it is  im feeling a bit nappy  orion your hair looks fine  liam well i sam wait shushes  matt if you need rest then rest  time of day has no bearing down here  marisha i have to rest so i can  im gonna read up on this daylight spell  so that you and me can both cast it  ashley yeah well just take a nap and just get  you know rest our /none/ muscles and get ready for the fight  travis im gonna read up on this chopping head spell  yep im read up  sam im gonna sing a little song to inspire  a couple of my allies here if i can  matt okay i would recommend doing it after rest  the dice would go away while they rest  sam okay forget it  marisha i go ahead and i light an incense  in our teepee and i make some flowers grow  thats better thats nice  taliesin im gonna do a little bit /none/ of work  on that first trick arrow  on the trap arrow  since ive got a little time  matt go ahead and make a roll  taliesin thats a  what am i rolling  matt your engineering your tinkers kit  taliesin oh its just an intelligence roll right  matt plus your tinkers kit proficiency  its down underneath your skills  proficiency at the very bottom left  taliesin yeah i dont have a number for that  matt you can add your proficiency modifier to your intelligence check  add your intelligence modifier /none/ plus four  taliesin ah thank you  17  matt all right and so what are you trying to accomplish  with this arrow again  taliesin i was just trying to make an entanglement arrow  its a trappers arrow  matt okay  you manage to work out what seems like a tanglefoot bagtype  detonation where if an arrow were fired  it would be a grapple check against the individual  probably give them penalties until theyre able  to break free of the grapple  so yeah success on that one  travis nice /none/ job doogie  taliesin im gonna be hawkeyeing laura out at some point  i got a couple of them  orion before i retire clarota  you said you wanted to speak with me later  anything in particular  or you wish to save it for after the battle  matt perhaps after  i just am curious about the source  of your arcane power  orion ooh id be happy to discuss it  i could learn a great deal from you as well  matt later  orion later of course  i go to /none/ my books  matt so clarota closes his eyes  and kind of goes into a meditative stance  the rest of you those who have spells to choose  go ahead and choose your spells accordingly  for the next day  travis rub it in  im sharpening my ax  matt good good  travis it is good  sam just doing my vocal warmups  ♫ me me me me me me me me me ♫  marisha im meditating  sam ♫ molto bene molto bene  molto bene molto bene ♫  travis the /town/ human torch was denied a bank loan  all laugh  matt so as you all have your evenings rest  not very comfortable  number one youre in the middle of a tent  of a goblinoid city second  just the general proximity of sleeping near an illithid  you just have a general sense of unsettling dreams  imagery that is disturbing  pike you have many flashbacks to the vision you had  and actually wake partway through the night  in a cold sweat  as you wake up you all kind of slowly come /none/ to  its about four hours into the evenings rest  you feel a slight tremor  a familiar tremor that you felt once before in this cavern  rumbling  you feel the ground begin to vibrate and shake  taliesin i get up and look around  sam is clay awake  all laugh  matt eyes are open just sitting there  sam clarota do you know what that rumbling is  matt there are many creatures that live in this rock  youd best be still  sam ooh still  matt still  orion dont /none/ move  travis so vocal warm ups  matt everyone make a stealth check  marisha oh  travis fucking nipples  marisha pooper  travis we get advantage on that right  matt nope  orion 16  sam 14  marisha 19 taliesin 18  liam 20  ashley one  travis one  all laugh  matt two natural ones  travis yup  sam after her two natural 20s  liam nothing to add  ashley nothing to add  well im new to armor you know  matt you both rolled natural ones  those /none/ both count as two failures  ashley fuck  matt thankfully the rest of your group all rolled pretty high  so it was four versus five  orion yes  matt you guys just barely succeed  as you all hold still barely breathe  the rumbling intensifies  and goes on for a good minute minute and a half  before it eventually subsides  travis aw  thought we were gonna get a warm up  matt fades into the distance  rumbling is complete  it appears to be no issue  clarota says  many /none/ of these creatures they pick up on movement  in that sound be wary  liam what creatures are you speaking of now  is this something  sam the rumbling creatures  liam but what are they  orion probably buttholes  matt ive only got glimpses  liam this is something worse than umberhulks i assume  matt larger yes  sam all right weve all rested up  liam buttholes in the underdark  sam i had a crazy dream  it said if geek  sundry got to 1400 followers  there would be some sort /none/ of a giveaway  orion oh i had the same dream scanlan  sam wow  matt yeah guys just so youre aware  every 50 subscribers we get  we are giving away an awesome geek  sundry game package  zac ethanmyhead just won one  matt oh there you go congratulations  we already got a winner  well be putting those out for every 50 subscribers we get tonight  well be choosing one to win that awesome award  our wonderful package so keep that in mind  sam so the plan is again you /none/ and i  stealth the rest attack with light  whats first whats second what happens here  liam well i need to take a moment to find some  im gonna look around and see if i can find any pitch  anywhere in the goblin camp  matt okay go ahead and make a survival check  actually this would be investigation  liam investigation  i got the exact same number 12  matt takes about an hour  you manage to find essentially a few piles of  rather disgusting sticky goblinoid refuse  that you /none/ imagine will probably stick and burn pretty well  in a pitchtype way yeah  liam goblin shit  matt you find just a whole bunch of goblin shit  liam lets cook it up a little  taliesin how do you feel about lacing it with gun powder  sam ill make some fire for you  liam feel pretty good about that  marisha goblin molotov cocktails i like that  taliesin goblin poop cocktail  liam so heres how i think this goes  i think the team  infuses the carpet and any shields  or /none/ head pots they have with radiant light  they go in and make a big stink on the side of the camp  you and i go in youre invisible  im a  sam fly flea mosquito dragonfly whatever youd like  liam yes lets say fly  we go in find the illithid and then  we pop in  you yell hey spanky  throw goblin shit in its face  sam or i try to blind it with magic  liam yes  taliesin both  orion both why not both  liam we want to /none/ increase our odds  as soon as hes blind i go in for the kill  and then its on us to deal with what happens after that  travis its playtime  liam its playtime  sam might i suggest one other wrinkle  liam yes please do  sam remember there are some dwarves being held captive  we can make our way to them and release them  travis we dont need all of them though  just to cause further distraction  or to get some allies on the inside  liam its possible they could /none/ be weary frightened  taliesin mind controlled  liam seems unreliable yes mind controlled  travis theyre probably ready to fight like me  all laugh  sam grog we understand you want to bash some things  liam your time to kill is coming  sam all right is there anyone else in the party  who could help us with stealth or anything  ashley definitely not me  sam okay  travis clang clang  ashley clang clang clang clang  matt as a note just remember  because youre the one who walked through  there /town/ is essentially a shanty town  a tent city of war tents  with a few rock formations  you also notice that or you remember last time  that there was the main square that had the raised platform  and then there was the small stone barracks  where it seemed both the mind flayer  and the duergar general both went back in  sam so we gotta go into the barracks  matt well thats where you saw at least they were  last time you were there  liam thats our starting point i imagine /none/  orion well theres two targets  sam so we gotta get in and then get in  liam the main thing is to get the illithid  because if hes out nobodys  then theyre all separate  hes playing chess with all his minions  until we take him out  travis i hate chess  orion so we all strike right on him  you two are going to take that little journey  the rest of us what shall we do  i have many options and theyre all fun  so percy  your sniper /none/ rifle  i should think that you want to post up  and start taking out position  taliesin ill do that at first  but then eventually  im going to just have to jump into the fray  orion yes of course onslaught to the rest of the camp  that well go about it too right  make a bunch of noise a bunch of light  sam how are you going to get grog over there  marisha im gonna put a giant sunlight beacon on his head  and im gonna release him to the /none/ wilds  liam yes but theres no bridge we talked about  marisha oh how are we gonna get him over it  liam we have an infinite amount of rope  sam how do we get it over there  liam tiberius talks about making him light as a feather  travis or you can fly me  sam yes you can fly him right  orion perhaps you can fly  travis why dont we turn my pot into a lighthouse  and then you fly me over and ill do like  abominable snow man walk  /dung/ marisha i like that  liam clarota is there anything you can do  to help us on this endeavor  matt i can try to cloud his mind  with mine  but you have to swear to protect me from harm  liam you have our word  sam  that we will try  all laugh  matt then i will come  you must work swiftly  if we can leap most of the city  get to that barrack storm it  and take out the mind flayer that resides  sam lets set down /none/ right in the middle of the thing  marisha well i was gonna say can we set down where  were kind of backing you guys up  holding the fort down while you guys go  liam

little ditty to inspire vax  ♫ i didnt see the vax  ♫ cause hes so goddamned stealthy  ♫ da da da da da da da da  travis was that i saw the sun  sam yes it was  all laugh /none/  matt that wondrous rendition allows you  a d8 inspiration dice hold on to that  orion is everybody finished  liam vox machina lets do this shit  marisha i turn into an eagle and ill take the gnomes  matt all right  scanlan  pike is heavy with the plate mail  but its still enough to carry with your giant eagle form  liam tiberius percy and i are on the carpet  and tiberius are you good to help grog fly across  orion fly  matt at which point you feel this strange /none/ lifting sensation  for a second your stomach kind of has butterflies  and you realize that you can just think forward  and you drift forward  think back you drift back  think up you drift up  travis amazing dont puke in the helmet though  that would be gross  imitates puking  orion am i light enough for him to take me in  travis i cant see anything  just a cauldron on my head  orion for him to carry me  matt for him to carry you  yeah yeah  orion /none/ i hop on your back  lets go grog  travis great  marisha i guess the rest of them are on the rug  travis i cant see so you gotta tell me  i start flying the wrong way  orion back up the other way other way very good  matt you actually clutch grog by the sides of his face  and start steering him  all laugh  orion wherever i move your head  just tilt that way  sam are we all in flight now  liam were all taken care of yes /none/  sam and the carpet  liam tiberius percy and i are on the carpet  sam what about vex  is she with us  ashley shes on the carpet  sam shes staying behind  matt vex for the time being  because its just easier to organize for that  is coming on the carpet with you guys  and is preparing in case she is needed  taliesin shes just quiet  cause shes feeling smug  about the last game  liam yes  matt shes feeling smug about making another rpg right now  /none/ liam shell be back  sam i wanna see how you fly grog  orion its really rickety  travis its one arm in and one forward  all laugh  orion just think  liam do you propel yourself with thoughts  matt its an awkward zig zag  taliesin do you think happy thoughts  marisha im gonna fly in the middle  between grog and the carpet  that way my pass without a trace encompasses everybody  matt all right  liam i turn to scanlan and say scanlan  we are probably going to die /none/ today  it has been an honor  sam it has been an honor  ashley you wont die today  sam only one of us will die  and it wont be me  i can be invisible  all laugh  orion youre not listening itll just happen  liam what were you saying tiberius  orion nothing  liam dont play it that way what were you saying  orion i was saying if youre all finished  ill just make you invisible right before it happens  matt you guys are all coasting over the chasm /none/  now youre over the top of the large bridge  and the 200footwide open hole in this tunnel  that leads to the lake below  as you glance down you can see just a little bit  of a trickle from the soft red light  that is deeper inside  you can see the small streams of lava  theyre just slowly pooling at the bottom  on the outskirts of the lake proper  as you begin to make it to the other side  you can see tiny shapes moving in this  barely lit /none/ war camp of the duergar  as youre coasting over  and clarota is along with you guys with his hood up  he kind of whispers into all of your heads just  beware that some of these armies  carry abominations created below within my city  i know not what to expect from them  so be wary  as this happens everyone make a stealth check  everyone because of the pass without a track  everyone gets a plus ten to their stealth check  travis plus ten  matt plus ten  thanks to /none/ keyleth sam thank god  matt keyleth however you are carrying two gnomes  so you have a disadvantage on it  ashley oh no  liam its all right  marisha even with the plus 10  18  matt 18  sam 15  taliesin 22  travis 27  sam wow  ashley 23 liam 28  matt all right  you guys begin to crest over the very top of the war camp  and looking down you can see now  there are what looks to be the beginnings  of tunneling siege engines being /none/ constructed  sam what siege  matt siege  you can see giant wheeled carts with drills up front  giant auger bores that are being currently constructed  you can see what looks like a series of weapons  being stacked at the ready  you can see there is a preparation  for some sort of attack on the city above  liam want to take kraghammer  matt continue to press ahead  there does not seem to be any reaction to your flying  sam dont say anything  liam this close to the ceiling  /none/ ashley good thing we didnt cast the light  orion we can all talk to each other  sam whisper to each other  shut up  marisha oh cool  sam just wait til we get there  matt you guys make it towards the center portion of the city  travis roll shake it roll shake it roll shake it  taliesin die rolls  matt you can just start beginning to see  the opening in the center of this war camp  there is a circle where there are no tents constructed  you can see /none/ what looks to be a small wooden platform  and there is a stone building that is of  makeshift functional construction  not pretty but functional looks like a barracks  or some sort of a large bunker  right on the northern side of that opening  that center portion of the war camp  that would be what you saw  both the general and the mind flayer head of this encampment  go into last time you  sam the barracks  matt yes  sam with a roof  matt there is a roof to /none/ it  you dont know if theres any roof access  but there is a roof  liam tiberius can you turn me invisible now  orion sputtering  sam but were still in the air right  hes gotta concentrate on that  liam hes sitting on the carpet  sam yeah but hes  marisha thinking about  sam him flying  orion i cast invisibility on you  thats when everything happens  all laugh  marisha just falls from the air  liam so are we floating above  matt you guys are currently  floating /none/ about 100 to 150 feet above the war camp  you do not appear to have been noticed yet  travis get down there and wing it  sam should we land on the roof  or do we land right outside the barracks door  what do we do  ashley roof roof roof  sam you guys wanna stay up and well go down  travis you go  yes  sam yeah travis yes  marisha we can start on the roof  that way that gives us time  liam but i cant go invisible while /none/ youre flying  travis who needs you to be invisible  youre a stealthy bastard  orion we land on the roof we get in there  i cast invisibility on you  and then you go do your thing  liam were running the risk of as we come down on duergar  going groans  orion we would risk that anyway either way  sam im so scared right now  all laugh  travis why dont we land on the roof  and we all lay flat  except for the people that are going in  /none/ and you cast invisibility  sam this is the exact  conversation they had  when they were about to go kill osama  all laugh  orion wait i have an idea  travis oh god  orion is there enough weight for me get on the carpet  at this point  ashley this is fucking stressful  matt you can certainly try  there was weight but youre not aware of how much was on it  orion yes i do its 1000 pounds  matt you dont know how much weight is on there total  /none/ orion everybody how much do you weigh  sam dont ask a woman that  orion im sorry your highness but i need to know  the idea is if i can step off on the carpet  and hang with you guys  then grog you can float down to the  whatchamacallit and take vax here  then i can oh shit i need to be near you to cast it  damn it all laugh  marisha lets just land on the roof  ashley lets land on the roof  liam were gonna go in were /none/ gonna hit the roof  you turn me invisible he turns him invisible  you guys light up the night and we just do it  we just gotta go  ashley were lighting up now  sam you light up on the roof  lets look for access first  dont light up til we give the go aside  ashley were still not safe stealthy  orion we need to wait before we light up  liam if anyone takes notice then turn off the lights  sam by the way  taliesin do not light up until /none/ you see the black  or greens of their eyes  sam by the way clarota  clarota you have definitely picked the right people  to assist you  matt theres no verbal response  but you do just emotionally sense a slight hint of regret  all laugh  matt emanating from the mind flayer  sam we got this  all right lets go land on the roof  liam all right lets do it  matt you guys descend  orion down down  matt eagle flies down you both wind rushing  as part of /none/ the landing  everyone make a secondary stealth check  taliesin and marisha we still have that plus 10  matt you still have the spell  orion oh yes  marisha oh that was cocked  taliesin yeah  marisha oh no  taliesin youre a terrible person  sam 30  orion 20  marisha im like those boobies that crash land when they fall  matt you rolled at disadvantage  marisha well i rolled a one  matt okay  two failures  taliesin thats a 15 29  travis 23 ashley 21  liam 28 /none/  matt pass without a trace is the saving grace  a bit of a harsh landing from your perspective  but thankfully you have two small gnomes to break your fall  ashley and sam groan  matt you drag them a little bit across the stonework on the top  its not stonework actually  most of this whole thing is stonework  it looks like the roof of this is made of  like a thick scavenged wood  whether it was taken from the surface  or from the mines itself  it is just wooden /none/ planks that are all keeping  ashley lets go in through the roof  taliesin its reclaimed its very nice  liam if that thing sees us though  it could be game over  i still think we should stick to the plan  of blinding it  orion yeah do it  sam so some of us need to go inside  liam you and i  travis yeah the two go inside and if shit goes down we light it up  liam i will fucking yell into my earring if shit goes down  and you /none/ guys gotta pray for me  travis go find shit  sam we look around for any roof access  travis come on chip n dale  matt looking around there is no roof entrance  it looks like it is purely a functional roof  for any weathering rocks  you do see there are a few small rocks  and pieces of cavern that may have plummeted here  sam no chimneys  matt no chimneys no nothing  there doesnt appear to be a fireplace  or any sort of interior like that  glancing over the /none/ sides you can see that on the floor  you cant really tell if theres two floors or not  it looks tall enough to have two floors  but you dont see a set of windows  or anything that belies that to you  may just be a really tall single floor  but there are a couple of small window openings  one on each side of  static  sam were gonna go  liam tiberius could you do me a favor  of making me disappear  orion yes when i do this though its /none/ going to be very cool  all laugh  liam holy shit where are my hands  orion right  matt you immediately disappear from view  you currently visually do not exist  marisha and you still have my buff  travis were like flat on the roof right  matt you guys are all on the roof now youre fine  your fly spell vanishes  you feel your weight return to you for a second  for a split moment youre a little sad  cause you were having fun  travis oh  all laugh  /none/ travis i was a dancer  sam we can see the window we pick one of the sides  i dont know west side  matt west side  sam is it a single pane  is it an openable window  matt as you glance over it is just an opening  there is no glass  there is nothing blocking the way  it is about roughly big enough to fit  a normalsized halfelf or human  liam i take scanlan by the scruff and  swing him down  sam oh i turn invisible  matt /none/ as you grab him and youre bringing him down  you cast invisibility on yourself  you both vanish now  all the rest of you are kind of holding your breath  hoping that now that you dont know whats happening  its gonna go well  liam im scaling in after him  liam go ahead and just make an acrobatics check  sam dont roll a one please dont drop me  liam 18  matt all right yeah youre good  you gingerly scale down the wall  the stones thankfully are  just haphazardly put /none/ together  where theres enough grip space for you to catch on  sam i have a climbing kit  all laugh  liam were in were in  matt little late for that but okay  all laugh  matt you lower him down you bring him inside  you step down through the opening  into the center of the hallway  sam we cant talk to each other  travis yes we get a map finally  sam we cant signal each other  and we dont know where each other is  i hold his hand /none/  all laugh  liam were holding hands im leaning way down on the side  travis course you are  liam sam and i have done this before  orion i use my earring  sam im not gonna talk back to you so whatever you say  orion just to remind you of how these particular things work  im not actually talking right now  so you can just talk to each other through the rings  matt as the two of you step into this room  you look about you  and there are some /tavern/ ramshackle makeshift beds in the room  five to be exact from right to left  this appears to be one portion  of a barrackstype sleeping arrangement  beds are empty theyre kind of tossed  theyre not like wellkept or anything  theres sheets kind of tossed about  and it smells awful in here but it  liam first i just heard tiberius voice in my head  so im going to test it out and think  scanlan can you hear me  sam can i hear him  matt from  liam i heard tiberius /none/ whispering about  sam from thoughts only can i hear him  matt no  liam i tug on his hand to keep going into the barracks  sam i notice that his hand is weirdly cold and sweaty  matt yeah not weirdly  liam you just lean to live with the stage fright  you never move past it  should we pause right now  marisha you didnt bring your stuff  laura i didnt have it  orion come on in  liam look my sisters here  laura hello  liam well make it work /none/  well bring you up to speed later  youre on the roof of osama bin ladens house  all laugh  liam so question for the dm im invisible  do i need to stealth do i stealth  matt theres still a stealth check cause youre invisible  but noise is still a factor  you just have  advantage on your stealth check  liam so i think we should probably stealth  and start moving in  sam yeah thats we tug each other  matt beyond being invisible you guys make your stealth check  /none/ sam i mean im invisible and i rolled a five  matt you have an advantage you roll twice  cause youre both invisible  sam 13  liam 20  matt all right  you both feel youre stealthed  there is one opening into a hallway here  liam we have does anyone have a laser light  travis yep  liam all right  travis squeeze it together  press the little button  liam squeeze it together  ah there we go  okay so were going to go down here  matt down to this /none/ one  as you guys step out  you can see immediately there are two duergar guards  right by a door that leads to a central chamber  liam so were gonna go this way  matt all right  immediately you see  travis i like how you guys have differentcolored lightsabers  matt two more duergar guards  travis lightsaber noises  liam all right im inching up  im pulling scanlan behind me  but im inching up to this door just peeking through  seeing what i can see  matt okay looking inside you /none/ can see these small symbols  basically just red stone the glow stone  that lights the underground caverns here  and in a large portion of kraghammer  are just embedded in the wall in a small sconce  peering through here you see one against the wall  you also see along the edges here  what looks to be racks of spears and pikes  and hammers and various war accoutrements of weapons  just hanging and theres a set of armor  over a small wooden  arrangement the armor itself is just being stored there /none/  this looks to be like a fastgrab armory  liam okay  i pull scanlan by the hand and we enter into this room  sam this is so romantic  liam its just like the day we met sam  mat you guys enter  liam quietly walking this way  were past the door that looks like the front door  matt it is the front door it is currently closed though  liam were gonna keep going this way  sam oh man were doing were flanking  matt just come out this way  there /none/ is one duergar here  there doesnt appear to be a doorway or entrance  to the central chamber on this side of the hallway  sam thats pretty good  liam i still have the pitch in a bucket  the shit in a bucket in my hand by the way  sam we can take these guys im not worried about that  liam but wed make noise  how far apart are the two duergar standing in that door  matt theyre about five feet apart just enough space  like one is on each side of /none/ the doorway  liam okay  sam wait  what are those red things right there  matt those are the small sconces with the glow stone  the red stone that lights the  sam so were trying to get there  orion  with greater invisibility so you can attack  and youll still be invisible  liam i pull a gold coin out of my pocket  and throw it in this corner  sam this is straight up metal gear  all laugh  matt go ahead and just make a general dexterity check  liam /none/ and because of keyleth i have advantage correct  matt yes  orion sure do  liam so this is what is this  matt just a dexterity modifier  liam so thats a 17  matt all right you  coin ringing  ringing sound both of the duergar kinda look over  they look at each other  grunt for a second  this one nods her head and begins walking over  to inspect it this one stays at its post  marisha metal gear voice must have been my  imagination  all laugh  liam /none/ i pull scanlan behind me  and tiptoe right behind this asshole  travis do it put it in him  liam and take out my vorpal blade  and reach out and grab him by the hair  and stick it in the back of his neck  sam you got my dice  matt all right so as you reach up  you grasp the back of this really nasty  wiry thick duergar hair  liam im so tense right now  matt you yank the head back and take the base of the blade  go /none/ ahead and make an attack roll  its a surprise roll  so you have an advantage on the attack  liam okay good  matt i believe you have a bonus too  if you get the attack  liam yes  marisha sneak attack  liam well i get  yes i get  advantage but you cant triple up on advantage i believe  loud bang offscreen  sam what was that  matt that was to freak you out  all right so just doublechecking here  as part of your ability  sam remember every /none/ 50 subscribers gets a free giveaway  orion subscribe now kids  ashley what is that smile  matt if you score it and the creature  is surprised  it is a critical hit thats the other thing  i was going to mention  liam thank you  so this isnt a dexterity check this is an attack  matt this is an attack  liam okay  so thats a 26  matt that is going to hit and that is a critical hit  go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack  taliesin yeah  /none/ laura die die die  liam im sweating  okay thats two plus seven is nine  thats nine thats just that part  six  seven  nine  14  and 19  which is whats doubled the sneak attack damage  matt the sneak attack damage and the dice damage  matt and the dice damage 19 plus is 26  52  marisha oh  taliesin whoa  matt as you pull the head back you can hear a slight  a slight gurgles is about as much noise  as can make it out before /none/ the blade just  right out the front of its throat  blocking any passage of the air  as you hold it you twist the blade  it goes limp in your hand  but you catch it and keep holding it there  so it doesnt make any noise  youre now clutching a dead duergar  sam easy easy  ashley shushes nightnight  laura oh yeah  travis lean him up against the wall like hes standing there  liam just had a thought  im going to sit him back against the wall  and /none/ let him slide against it and grab scanlan  and into the room  matt into this room  marisha theres scanlan  taliesin hes still standing up kind of  laura why is he leading scanlan whats happening  liam shushes  sam while im invisible i look around for traps  im just gonna see if theres any trap doors  matt go ahead and make a perception check  sam not great  liam i got a 28  sam nine  matt you notice no traps what you do notice though  is there a giant /none/ kind of war room table  at the top of this raised platform  its about six feet up  and theres a stairway that leads up to it  you see at the table  one of the illithid mind flayers  the armored general that you saw before  and there are two other duergar currently  at the table  travis nope nope nope nope  ashley stay invisible  sam we cant communicate  travis you guys have got seconds until  that other guard comes back  liam we cant talk  matt you hear /none/ footsteps behind you  liam i put the bucket of shit into scanlans hands  laura what are you doing  liam give him a little nudge  a gentle little nudge  sam i step forward into the room  and i hurl it at the fuckers face  the mind controllers  liam and im rolling behind him at the same time  behind the illithid ready to go  matt so ill say you go up here as well  liam oh yeah behind him behind him  laura what is happening  matt make a stealth /none/ check both of you  travis oh god oh god  oh god over extended  sam wait do we get the plus ten to stealth  matt no  liam plus advantage oh thank christ  sam 19  liam using scanlans advantage so 16 29  sighs  matt okay  you slink up behind seemingly unnoticed  theres a slight twitch to the mind flayers head  for a second as you go ahead  and take a big ol  sam bucket of shit  matt and fling it  all laugh  matt go ahead /none/ and make an attack roll  it would be youre not proficient with  goblin shit buckets unfortunately  so go ahead and roll a d20  and add your dexterity  orion groans  sam my dexterity  matt dexterity or strength whichevers higher strength higher  sam no no strength is not higher for me  oh it is higher  so 19  matt all righty  taliesin oh my god  matt you fling it as the invisibility spell wears off of you  as part of the attack you fling the bucket  a spray /none/ of thick green goblin fecal matter  goes streaking through the air  as the illithid turns its eyes wide  to see you suddenly appear  and then suddenly see this entire batch of thick goblin shit  just splashes across its face  suddenly you see his tentacles writhing  as it screams all of you hear in your head  a scream  liam im stabbing im stabbing  orion i cast stoneskin immediately  matt as this happens you cast stoneskin  you go in for the blade  and you hear a counter voice in /none/ your mind  ashley fuck  matt clarota going now  marisha i cast light on grogs head  matt your head comes to an extremely bright glow  all of you averting your gaze  liam this is stealth right stealth for me  matt no youre invisible  liam oh okay  sam attack attack kill him  liam 29

take the blade and as it pierces the back  liam oh its a poison one by /none/ the way  orion damn  matt it pierces the back of its skull  you feel the muscles in its neck  tense in reaction to the blade but the blade slips past  you can see a gout of purplishblack blood  begin to spill from its neck  as it instinctually reaches up  and pulls the blade from the back of its head  whats the dc on the poison  liam i have no idea  matt it should be on the blade info  liam poison dagger  taliesin fuck  ah  liam /none/ i think its oh its 15  taliesin this was a good plan  matt the poison does not seem to take effect  the body resists it  it is still alive  but its clutching the back of its neck  as it turns around going sputters  you can see its blood spurting out of its mouth  and its eyes are now just burning with rage  all the rest of these duergar are now reaching  and pulling their weapons out  everyone roll initiative  all yell  laura i dont have my stuff /none/ with me  liam natural 20  matt oh shit  sam lets kill some bad guys  travis i dont know what youre doing  matt all right so  25 to 20  liam 20 natural 20  matt but you have no bonuses  you should have your dex

you swing across with the flame tongue dagger  as it backs up you put another gash  across the front of its neck and chest area  it reels back and is looking at you with angry fury  you /dung/ feel this coming shake  this horrible force of severe retribution  coming to your mind and as youre bracing for it  you take your other blade  you see its mouth opens up with frustration and anger  as its tentacles kinda curl back  and just go in for the grab  you place the blade squarely into that maw  you feel the scraping of its teeth across your knuckles  but it doesnt matter  because whatever anger and light was once in its face  goes dark and dull  all cheer  matt /none/ as immediately it crumples to the ground  lifeless pull the blade from the maw  mind flayer down  all cheer  marisha yeah vax  matt he was next but not anymore  as it falls to the ground  all the rest of the duergar immediately  have a reaction  well get to their turn in a second  vex youre up  so youre on the roof

release your hand as this suddenly /none/ flaring blast  of divine energy comes cascading  out of the front of your palm  blasting into the side of the face  nearly searing one of the eyes of the creature  it rears back brings one leg up instinctually  growls slams the ground in the process  how you doing  thats disadvantage to your next attack  liam aw  ashley wait what are you at  taliesin im at 38  matt it lands puts its foot back on the ground  and kinda gears its attention towards you  its angling around /none/ the room  for what should be its next meal  anything else you wanna do  ashley can i give him a healing potion  can i heal him  matt hes too far away  you could use your bonus action  if you wanna use healing word  ashley okay ill use healing word  matt okay so go ahead and roll that for him  while youre doing that brings us  so clarota now gets its action  marisha yeah clarota  matt clarota now looks wideeyed seeing this happen  you hear a slight /none/ voice in the back of your head go  this is complicating  as it rears back  you hear the slight echoing screeching sound  that just manages to skirt the outside  of your mental capacity  you feel like if you were any closer  or if it was directed towards you  it would be a horrible ringing pain in your head  youre just peripheral to it  it makes its attack  unfortunately the exterior the bulette  andor its mind shielding is too strong  it seems to have no effect on the /none/ creature  sam damn it  clarota worthless  matt a bulette is the entity  that ends its turn top of the round vax  liam okay i think wheres the laser  here it is  it looks like i have just enough squares to go  one two three  whos this right here  matt thats a duergar  weapon on the ground not armed right now  liam can i get to here on a turn  i cant tell  matt whats your movement  liam its 30 feet  ill use my bonus /none/ action to click my haste boots together  matt okay then you can definitely do that  liam okay and since percy is right up against it  im able to deal sneak attack damage  because theres another one of its foes  matt exactly yes  you dont get an advantage on the attack  but if you attack you do it  liam so im gonna try to strike him in his underbelly  matt all right  even the underbelly itself is heavily armored  you have to kind of gauge quickly where the plate is /none/  liam 20  matt 20  20 hits  matt go ahead and roll with your sneak attack damage  marisha so 20 hits  liam oh and it was  never mind  so three  there we go  22  matt 22 damage  all righty  got it  cool that brings us to  the general is going to attempt to make a saving throw  sam shit  he can do that  matt every time he gets a turn round  he gets a chance to break out of the  and /none/ he does  sam oh he broke out  laura gasps  matt shrugs off the mental influence of the dominate spell  however he is not currently armed  he uses his  movement or action to pick up the war hammer  fury and anger is in his eyes  marisha hes still grappled  sam no no he just broke out right  marisha oh from the grapple too  matt yeah he used his whole turn to break out of the grapple  and grab its weapon thats all he can do  sam where is /none/ he  matt right there  liam to fight the bulette  or to  matt you have no idea  liam oh we dont know oh  he could just be reacting to the bulette  matt the flames on the hammer are out too  but it picks up the war hammer  its cold black steel currently  travis we got our davy jones in the room  hell take care of the dwarves  matt that brings us to  grog  travis groans  kitty  i would like to go into a frenzied rage /none/  and charge at clifford the big red dog  all alguh  matt you leap off the higher platofrm  come rushing out with your ax in the air  as you come down using the full weight of your body  behind the attack go ahead and roll your three attacks  travis all right i have nine eight 17  sam you have one dice from me  ive inspired you  travis oh  sam singing grog grog  travis is it a 20 or is it a what  matt you get to add a /none/ d8 to an attack roll  sam if you have a shitty attack roll  add a d8 to it if you have a shitty roll  travis 17  orion grog smash right through his plate thingy  matt barely hits  travis 19  matt hits all three attacks hit  travis yeah that one hits 16 plus eight  matt so all three attacks hit roll damage for three hits  as you come now just slamming your grey ax  into the side of this armored beast  just over and over again  cleaving this /none/ nice little wide section  of its armor on the side  liam take his fucking head off  travis 14  21  21 again  ashley what  travis 22  laura oh so  22 21 and 14  sam whoa  laura i was doing his math  all laugh  matt 21 22 and 14 you said  ashley 57  sam 57  travis i dont wanna do math and show you all up  liam thats a level nine barbarian  matt so slam him you see a portion of its side armor /dung/ splits  you can see a little bit of that dark red fleshy interior  you do a significant amount of damage  and leave a nice little weak point in its armor  however it still doesnt seem  to be entirely phased by the damage  it just kinda shrugs at the damage  and kinda glares at you for a second  one of its eyes that was focused on percy and keyleth  now looks over at you jurassicpark style  with the trex up at the side of the vehicle  vex  laura i /none/ back up a little bit  yeah like that  and im gonna cast hail of thorns on him  matt okay  sam sounds nasty  laura right  im gonna shoot like a regular attack  matt so your bonus action to cast hail of thorns  and then you attack with the arrow go for it  laura yes  matt youre adding 11 to it  laura okay good then thatd be  18  matt 18 18 hits  laura yes so i was casting that as a level three spell  i roll 3d /none/ that means i roll 3d10  matt against the creature  laura against 14 which is my  spell level thingy  travis 3d10  laura yeah 1d10 for damage  matt yep go for it  laura that is an eightsided dice yay  matt there yougo  laura an eight  matt thatd be 25  laura i get another attack so im gonna do that  natural 20 all cheer  matt nice all right go ahead and roll damage  double the dice and add your modifier of seven  liam that arrow just went slow /none/ mo  laura double the dice  15  matt 15 all right  so what happens here is you pull an arrow out  as you whisper a couple of words under your breath  you see all these thorny spikes being to shoot out  the shaft of the arrow  you release it and as it strikes in the front of its face  the arrow actually splinters  sending a bunch of these thorns all over its torso  piercing an inch or two into its armor  with each blast of these thorns  it /none/ kinda rears back and tries to shake itself off  as it does you get a little bit of a look  as grog backs away from it  checking to see the wound he left  you take your secondary arrow aim for the red soft spot  boom slips right past the armor plating  doing the extra damage on the interior  of its physical self  awesome thats your turn i believe  ashley good turn  matt percy youre up  taliesin okay is my hand still stuck in its  mouth  all laugh /none/  taliesin i would like it to be  matt if youd like to yeah you couldve left it there  taliesin do i have an advantage to hit  if my gun is in its mouth  all laugh  matt you are considered grappled if you leave your hand there  you can remain grappled for advantage on the attack roll  taliesin done  so i get to roll twice  matt you do  marisha this is a whole new meaning to pointblank  taliesin 19  matt 19 thatll hit  taliesin okay i spent /none/ some grit on this  and did some interesting modifiers  matt how much grit did you spend  taliesin two points of grit  matt okay this is the  taliesin the deadshot  and i also took a negative  five hit for a plus ten damage to this shot  and im using my fire modifier  im just being an asshole  all laugh  marisha thats amazing  taliesin thats  16 and 20 35 points of fire damage  inside of its mouth  matt so your hand inside you pull back and fire /none/  knowing which barrel is next  you hear this dullmuffled explosion sound  and its eyes kinda pulse for a second  in intense fury and pain  smoke just billows out the sides of its mouth  and its nostrils and it begins to kind of shake its head  lifting you about a foot off the ground  painfully but you think its worth the deal  well done  taliesin thank you  liam aw man  matt i will say that ends your turn  liam thank you gary gygax wherever you are  all /none/ laugh  matt all right  the duergar

mouth wide and then id like to reach in  and with my teeth pull its fucking tongue out of its head  and start thrashing it side to side  all laugh  matt first you rush up with your ax  using all of the aggression you take it and swing it  barely leaving you with a shave  you gash the side of its mouth  and draw this giant wound open  as /none/ it does you actually snap  and cut through the tendons that clench the jaw  causing it to fall open and slack  scanlan spills out of its mouth  hitting the ground with a dull thud  as its mouth is now open it kind of rears back  you shake your head angrily  as the froth is gathering at the corners of your mouth  you drop your ax from one hand grab the jaw  reach in bite down on its giant meaty tongue  using your hand at the back of it  you /none/ pull and yank and you feel the muscle  tearing and tensing before eventually it comes free  and is now dangling about 25 30 pounds  of very very wet tongue meat  with your third attack how do you finish it  all laugh  travis what do you after youre biting its tongue in your mouth  matt thats what im asking  travis thats a good point  matt its looking really rough  but you still need to get that final death blow  what are you doing with this grog  ashley rip him /none/ apart  travis yeah im gonna king kong his jaw  im gonna take the broken part the top of his head  and just pull apart  matt okay so you drop your ax entirely  the tongue still dangling from your mouth  you reach and put one foot up into the bottom of the jaw  using your other hands you push and push  you hear it crack and pull  as it tenses and is trying to push down  it has no tension because the jaw was destroyed  you pull back and hear /none/ a sickening snap  as the armor plate buckles underneath  where the neck joint would be on such a creature  its eyes kinda roll back for a second  and it begins to slacken  as it does you reach up with your fist  and penetrate the bottom of where its brain would be  with a sickening suction sound  it goes entirely limp and collapses on the ground  liam and thats why youre on the team  all cheer  travis and as it falls  the tongue thats hanging in my mouth  /none/

so join us in the global celebration  on april 11th  play /none/ more games  hey everybody im wil wheaton  and i am coming to you semilive  from the twitch tv set here at the geek  sundry stages  in beautiful downtown burbank california  i am here to tell you everything you ever wanted  to know about tabletops rpg show  coming this june but were afraid to ask  or have been asking for close to a year  and ive been saying  well tell you at some point in the future  you can consider this the big announcement  it was incredibly difficult /none/ to cast this show  we needed people who were very comfortable  improvising who had experience playing role playing games  and who were available when we planned to shoot the show  it was surprisingly difficult to get a pool of people  who fit all of those criteria  and choose the most awesome among them  so your cast playing in this wonderful show are  yuri lowenthal laura bailey hank green  and alison haislip  im really excited to have these people all together  theyre all my friends  they are all wonderful /none/ storytellers  and they are going to be a tremendous party  of adventurers  im only gonna try to kill them a little bit  the most frequently asked question  since i announced that there was going to be  a tabletop rpg show is hey wil wheaton  why are you so awesome  the second most frequently asked question is  what system are you using to power this game  first and foremost  i needed a system that was going to support  the way i play roleplaying games  and that is telling /none/ a story collaboratively  with a group of players with me as the gm  i looked at some very well known systems  like dungeons  dragons and savage worlds  i looked at systems that i love like fate core  and i even looked at the true 20 a d20 modern system  and i really wanted to use something  that was released by an independent publisher  i wanted to bring something to the forefront  of the roleplaying world that maybe not as many  people are familiar with as i want them to /none/ be  but i wanna play the way that i played  when i was falling in love with roleplaying games  when i was a kid  i wanna be able to sit around on a couch  and some chairs with my friends  not have to worry about a map on a table in front of us  and just work together to use our imaginations  to tell a story  but theres a system that i really love  thats elegant its easy to learn  its easy to teach its very easy to understand /none/  and it really just gets out of the way  when you want to tell a story together  and that is the adventure game engine  that green ronin publishing used  to drive the dragon age tabletop roleplaying game  i asked the developer three years ago  to please make generic  so that we can build a setting and put on top of it  they said actually this is something we really wanna do  and its come together  we have been able to work together with green ronin  to develop the /none/ fantasy adventure game engine  this is gonna take a lot of the things you know  from the dragon age rpg  and put it all together to support our world  which i have had the best time creating  i sat down three months ago with some amazing writers  and just started brainstorming about what kind of world  we wanted to explore  but what i kept coming back to is  i love science fiction and i love fantasy  why not put them together  why not build a world that is inspired /none/ by  the 1978 heavy metal movie  and 1980s amazing saturday morning cartoon show  thundarr the barbarian  i thought it would be great for characters  to encounter goblinoid kind of creatures  and instead of them using crossbows  theyre using laser rifles  ive got it all worked out  we have a huge team of writers that put all this together  that built an amazing codex  that gave terrific logic to all of these  decisions that we made  were not gonna tell you what they are  you may discover /none/ some of them during the course  of the season  so what is the name of this incredible world  the title of our show is titansgrave the ashes of valkana  you can sort of come up with your own ideas  about what those words mean  i know but im not

ahead poison ivy  becca if anyones wondering why so many batman cards  are /none/ being drawn its because there are five in the deck  theres either one or two of all the other characters  so i draw and i will play myself poison ivy  this card says  choose any player including yourself  to discard his or her hand and draw a new card  ivan you look pretty confident  discard  ivan discard all right  becca and draw a new hand  ivan had a twoface  ify its time for me to draw  ivan i have a hard time thinking that were  gonna get /none/ anything out of you in that mask  ify oh youll see  becca im

harley quinn  becca incorrect  hector geez were terrible at this game  ivan were really really bad  becca im great at it  ify sooner or later  ivan hes in there or hes there  not /none/ there there  not there there  becca there ivan there  becca where  hector im going to play my own version of bane  that was terrible  becca you dont have the mask  hector myself and another player can secretly compare hands  and whichever hand is lowest is out  so im gunning for you poison ivy  because you kissed me that one time  and then you didnt wanna hang out with me afterwards  like that was really mean so  becca i had ulterior motives  ivan im not looking batmans /none/ not looking  becca im out of the game  hector youre out yes  becca i had myself again  ivan which means you have a higher numbered card  hector yes that is correct  ivan higher than five  hector good detective work batman  real genius this one  ivan all right  this is the last card of the deck  which means after this whoever has the highest card wins  hector duh batman we know god  ivan im playing robin robin  all right  becca that makes me think he has /none/ the joker  ivan well well find out wont we  what do you got  ify i had myself  hector boom harley quinn beats bane  ivan and the joker beats harley quinn  hector darn it  ivan i got you joker  becca take your token  ivan i will take my narcissistic token  that has my symbol on it  hector this is just what batman needed an ego boost  batman needed an ego boost great  ify robin  becca the deb chef the deb chef  hector you seem to live /none/ with a multi billionaire  yet cant afford contacts  whats the deal with that  becca no burn card no burn card  ivan oh great  so since i won the last round i get to play first  because i am the greatest detective  and i got a catwoman  which means i think im interested in banes hand  whatcha got bane  you got crap is what hes got  becca choose any player including yourself  to discard his or her hand and draw a new card  hector burn your card  /none/ hector you got it but its robin  and im not gonna tell you again  all right i had batman which is cool  because hes the least value card in the game  so thats just gonna help me out  so im just gonna grab a new card  ify all right im going to draw  draw a card  oof oof oof such a good card  ivan who are you gonna use it on bane  becca its probably

looked at my hand  hector oh i did thats true  ify and saw me play the card  he knew exactly which card was in my hand  and chose the wrong card  ivan this is why youre /none/ the boy wonder and not batman  hector id like to point out  that my chest has made me very uncomfortable  and im clearly out of my element  and dressing me up as robin was a good call everybody  good call everyone  good call guys  wow  ify i really thought that was game over for me  i was wrong  hector oh my god  your annoying voice has really gotten into my head  becca thats his greatest power  ivan i also have the batman  so we know he /none/ doesnt have a batman you know what it is  thanks robin  useless  so im gonna guess that bane has harley quinn  ify you are wrong  ivan damn  i tried  all the clues are there just one missing element  becca i played batman im going to guess that bane has  twoface  ify you are wrong as well  ivan he has the joker then or something  how can you throw that many batmans at a single man  and not get what hes got in his hand  hector he /none/ really did break you he really did  and now im nightwing great thats how long that took  ify im going to say  twoface can trade hands with becca  becca sighs  ivan thats where it was  robin  hector its my turn  ivan diddly fingers  hector you guys think youre gonna win this  you dont know dick  greyson because thats my real

marisha great for my back  zac were live  matt whats up everyone  we got this camera right here in the middle right  ashley hello  liam oh hi  matt thank you guys /none/ for watching  hope you enjoyed yourselves  these guys all being crazy players  and kicking ass  and occasionally getting knocked unconscious  and nearly eaten  zac any mods want to put this in sub mode for us  lets do sub mode  marisha so you have to sub  bye everybody whos not a sub  ashley bye  zac they can still watch  they just cant ask questions  orion oh  okay  marisha well your word is not important  liam laura had to bugger out  ashley wait is that /none/ a little icon of you  matt yeah  ashley what  orion yeah hes an emoji now  ashley youre an emoji  matt its weird  taliesin hes made it  ashley youve made it  matt all right so how are we doing the questions  are we just picking as we go  zac you can moderate yourselves  ashley laura and sam did leave  matt unfortunately  ashley laura had to go to a thing and sam had to go to a thing  matt sams thing is kids  sam has two kids /dung/  liam has two kids but he  ashley hey look at  all laugh  matt i am so sorry everyone  liam i mean hes pretty good at dungeon mastering right  ashley yeah hes pretty good  orion someone asked what alignment we are  first question what alignment are our characters  marisha were all good  liam chaotic good  ashley chaotic good  orion tiberius is chaotic good  travis chaotic neutral bitches  liam what was your first roleplaying experience  i saw that go through  taliesin gurps in high school  /none/ all gurps  matt the second edition of dungeons  dragons in high school  travis this  ashley was my first yeah  liam this guy just started  i did add in high school  and i dmed while playing which is totally cheating  this is the first pure experience ive had  orion this is my first campaign also  i was a magic the gathering fan  marisha i actually had matt as my first dm way before  all this started  so i played a few other games and then  now im /none/ back to the og master  liam i saw when and how did you all start playing together  the reason this started is because  i directed matt as leon kennedy in resident evil 6  and every time he came in he would say  hey you know im running a game  you can come in and just do a one off  and i was like oh i got babies  i cant do that i cant do that i cant do that  and then finally once for my birthday i thought  i can /none/ do a one off itll be the only time well do it  just see how it goes  scanlan and i did a podcast together  and every week we would do some new thing  and were like fuck it lets play dd  we all did it and everybody got snake bit  and its been the best thing that ever happened  to me at least  ashley yup  orion our character alignments do matter  on how we play the characters an earlier question  matt yeah they do definitely matter  a couple /none/ quick answers here  the conversion from pathfinder to fifth edition  was decided because as were going on to this show  and we had so many players combat tends to get bogged down  and a lot of floating modifiers in pathfinder  for large groups like this its difficult  to keep it flowing and moving  i felt once i had taken a look at fifth edition  that the combat system was a little more simplified  and a little easier to make freeform and just roll with it  so that was a much /none/ better decision  plus dungeons  dragons generally has a better  name recognition than pathfinder  so when youre putting a show out there  its probably easier to do with very minimal transition  it took a little bit of customizing  like for percys gunslinger  we just had to customize it we made it ourselves  we sat down  taliesin took a day  matt took a day and we worked out  some of the stuff we wanted to keep  some of the things that didnt break it  we wanted to make /none/ it interesting  it is a martial archetype for the fighter class  so it does give the bonus a fighter class does  nothing is too overpowered about it  other than just having custom weapons  and some cool gritbased abilities  that we kinda transferred over from pathfinder  its interesting  its a good challenge to see how it works out  taliesin it is its working out  im digging it  i keep reading and finding things im not doing  that could be more interesting so  matt keeping your hand and firing /none/ into the mouth  of a bulette is fun  taliesin that felt great  liam travis everybodys asking about your shirt  travis oh  i think its a website called redbubblecom  i just googled grog and there was that  taliesin just google grog  travis i needed it right away  right right  liam im also seeing why did we switch  from pathfinder to fifth edition  matt i answered that a second ago  liam oh you did  matt yeah the idea being that the reason we switched  was it was /none/ easier for largescale combat  and the system was a little more simplified  and i felt for such a large party itd be easier to do  plus character creation for any guests we have  in the future so that was the main reason  i love pathfinder but at this size its good  answering your earlier question too  i saw someone ask a good party size  legitimately my preference is between four and six players  this works because theyre amazing players  and because we keep it very freeform  and not getting /none/ bogged down in minutia too often  the four to six players i think is a good sweet spot  marisha i see does keyleth have limitations  on what animals she can transform into  yeah for the most part i can only transform  into beasts and i have to be under  a certain challenge rating  so right now at my level i can only turn into beasts  that are a challenge reading of three or lower  matt a third of your druid level right  marisha yeah a third of my druid level /none/ which is nine right now  but for the most part i can change into  almost anything as long as its under a challenge rating  of three  matt pike how do you feel about scanlan  do you return his affections  ashley oh well  im on the fence about him  hes really pretty great but i dont know  im not really sold yet  marisha you know pike i feel like we havent actually  girl talked about this  ashley i know we never girl talked about it  marisha we should /none/  ashley i know we should talk  i just i really like him i think hes really funny  i really the fact that hes a musician but  marisha thats hot  ashley i dont know im not really sold on him yet  marisha im just concerned if he could treat you well  ashley oh no you know what  marisha hes got bad habits  ashley he likes to frequent brothels and things like that  which you know  id wanna give him his freedom and his space  i dont know if im /none/ into it  taliesin if i say it so you can understand it  whats the point  liam someones asking if we like presents  i think wed all like fan art  matt fan arts awesome we love it  liam immortalize our shitheadedness thatd be good  marisha oh its true  ashley another couple people on there  were asking about my ears  and i really like supporting small businesses  and theres a store on etsy called tiny tangerines  and she makes these by hand  and makes like deer and bears  /none/ she makes a ton of stuff  matt thats really cute  ashley check her out  liam we still got that little one  socrates asked what was a favorite moment  before we started streaming the show  our first game was pretty amazing  marisha our first game was great  ive got some good memories from that one  liam most of us i was giggling uncontrollably  i couldnt believe we were doing it  and just watching my friends who i work with all the time  just dropping into character there was no /none/ like  oh lets see what will i do what am i doing  i will move i will roll  like bailey bailey dropped into character from the getgo  and was a ringer  but the moment i was thinking of was when pike died  pike died  matt like died died  liam shortly before we switched from private to public  it was emotional  a couple people started crying i teared up  we put two and a half years into this  and were all very connected to it  im not gonna /none/ get into it  but ive had a hard couple of years personally  everythings fine but this was like therapy for me  and to see one of my friends go down  ashley it was sad  liam it was fucking emotional  marisha i dont think a few people were crying  i think everyone was crying  orion i was crying  ashley i was definitely crying  i was like no i love doing this so much  i dont wanna i mean  when you spend that much time with people  over two /none/ and a half years you get so attached  and attached to characters  marisha we know these characters almost as well  as we know each other now  matt factoids the tower you made for us  in minecraft is awesome  seriously well done look at the pictures  its great were gonna have to actually go through it  marisha wait we have a tower  matt a guy built an entire tower for the group  ashley no way  marisha they built a castle greyskull  matt essentially on the geek  sundry minecraft /none/ server  no  wait no i did see that  it was huge  zac it towers over the entire   liam of what  matt of him  someone made a sculpture of  did you make that or somebody else  you made that  zac oh no  matt okay somebody else made it for you  liam do we have 50 in the budget  to go on ebay and get a castle of greyskull set  put it on the set somewhere  lets do that  matt there we go  i /none/ see a couple quick questions  orion to answer your question  there is an origin of tiberius fully written  i wont say it all right now  but he comes from a political family  and theres a whole bunch of layers to him  he is a thoughtout character  the buffoonery is halfplanned  marisha i mean were all really deep thought out characters  orion well they asked if i actually thought out  a story for him  he does have a thing for this character named allura  matt yeah arcanist allura  /none/ the one that actually sent them on this mission  he has kind of a thing for  orion shes super awesome  hot i think shes hot  matt shes pretty hot  ashley super hot  matt the gunslinger class info  i actually posted on twitter a few days ago  its in my dropbox if you look through my twitter  its on there otherwise  well probably put it up on the website  when all the website stuff is up there  im happy to release it now  its pretty balanced its fun /town/  might have some tweaks down the road  depending on how things play out  you should go to my twitter youll find it there  travis were gonna have a website with all our characters  liam yeah were working towards that  matt working on it yeah  like a lot of things right now its a work in progress  liam someone asked what kind of food would everyone like  orion ooh like thai food  liam i like indian  matt ooh indian is good  ashley i really noticed  zac let them /none/ know not to order food  liam dont thats a terrible idea  orion we just had a bunch of chicken  marisha oh you mean like right now  yeah dont do it right now  zac if you tell them what you want  all of a sudden ill get a call like  your food is on the way  marisha yeah no not right now maybe next week  travis matt youre going to wizard world in philly  but we will not be joining  because we dont own a private fucking plane  marisha /none/ but ill be there  is anybody else gonna be there  travis oh really  marisha well be there  liam somebody asked something like  what do we hope is the result of this show  i cant remember the wording  obviously were doing this because we love each other  and were having fun together but i also hope  dd has been its entire history has been like  oh its this weird thing that guys do  with dice in a room  anyone can do this i love video games  i work /town/ in video games but dd has changed my life  it is social it is person to person it is real  because its people in a room doing shit together  and thats kind of lacking a little bit in our world  and i would say find some friends  i mean i love that there are sort of  online tools to play with people across the country  but if you can find three or four people in your town  to do this id say do it  do it  travis yeah do it /town/  marisha theres something really amazing about the fact  that were all essentially kind of building  and communally developing a story together  and thats something that not a whole lot  of things can grant you  and we dont really get in todays society much  were all kinda creating this as a thing  and i think its good that were like hey  this is socially acceptable  dds cool everyone should play dd  matt actually the it crowd episode of dd  is one of the best on camera examples  of /none/ a dd game night thing  orion that is an awesome episode  matt fucking hilarious and a great  truncated version of this is kinda what the game is  so good on you  orion cut to them weeping  taliesin so many questions going so quickly  matt i know  ashley i want a grog shirt that says do it  taliesin and the kitty shirts were an accident  this was not planned  marisha oh yeah our kitty shirts  liam someones saying what edition to start with  i would start with the /none/ most recent  because you know theyre gonna keep updating  it over the years  matt fifth is great fifth is a great entry point  liam its really loose  i feel like all of us felt like  we were doing pathfinder and  fucking loved it otherwise we wouldnt be doing it  but it was really intricate  and we were doing it every six or seven weeks  when we were offair so  we felt like the rules were really complicated  and wed lose track of it  we loved doing it /none/ obviously  but fifth edition is really fast and loose  i recommend that  and travis just stuck his finger in my ear  he kinda does that  he hits me in the nads a lot  matt this is a homebrew campaign  i wrote it all just kind of for the hell of it  custom dont really base it on anything existing  i feel like im playing more in that world  and i always hate the idea of in the middle of dming  having to go to a module  or having /none/ to look for a rule that wasnt my own  it feels more detached  there are modules that are great  and ive run great modules  but for me personally with the pacing  and the flow of the game i prefer to do homebrew  liam connected to that someone asked if you had any tips  and id like to know the answer to this too  because im running a game for my eightyearold son  and his friends who are about to start  do you have any tips for new dms  matt /town/ yes  lets see  i could do a whole panel on that  tips for new dms  preparation is important  you wanna outline cities come up with ideas for npcs  that you think would be essential to a story  or like people that really run elements of the town  simple notes can be like theyre this race  this is their disposition  if you have a particular voice you wanna try for  make a note of this kind of voice  so whenever you come back to them you have a reminder /none/  and spend a lot of time building that structure  you dont have to be too detailed  always leave room to play in the world  because you never know what your players are gonna do  be prepared to improv  i prefer loose preparation  and then just kinda rolling where the players take you  liam although you wrote a monologue for clarence right  because that was very intricate  we were all just ready  ashley yeah theres no way you just thought that up  matt there are certain elements  part /none/ of the notes i take is for certain npcs  ill write down key information that they know  and depending on how you ask them  what you say to them  and what you try and extract from them  they might give you some of the information  they might not if you coerce them or intimidate them  or if theyre willing to give up the information  i have all that written down  so for that information today  you guys were asking him and since you allied  with clarence he was willing /dung/ to discuss with you  so i had all that prewritten  but depending on how much you said  it was what you guys asked  liam do you have  random encounters ready in case were like  ah fuck it i dont wanna go down to the dungeon  i wanna go back up and beat up some dwarves  do you have shit kind of ready  matt yep i have a stack of different creature  and encounters already prebuilt  based on what you guys may encounter  tonight was an example of players /none/ being able  to pick what happened  but also its one of those things where it depended  i dont know where you guys are gonna go  i present a story  i present an idea of a general throughline  but how you guys go from point a to point b  thats entirely up to you  sometimes that can be a very long meandering line  sometimes it could be a direct ray so  travis there was a question how much do you improvise  and when is it appropriate to improvise  matt /none/ a lot and always  marisha always yeah  travis the answer is yes  matt ive had whole games where ive prepared a session  and none of it happened  because people just put an entirely wrong direction  not wrong but a different direction  so the whole game was just me  pulling everything out of my ass  marisha like that time we walked through the back door  of the thieves guild that was fun  matt yeah there was that  marisha whats up thieves guild  sup  orion donkey kong pikachu /none/  travis what  orion somebody asked me what my favorite  smash brothers character is  travis oh  liam somebody asked how we pick the character class  that we picked  when we first started this game and i said  hey its my birthday i wanna play a game  laura really likes rogues as well  but i made sure that as fast as i fucking could  travis she was pissed  liam so she yeah  she plays rogue in like dragon age and everything  that shits a favorite class of hers /none/  so i know i got it out there  also the reason that were twins  is because laura and i have the exact same birthday  may 28th  ashley i didnt know that  marisha i didnt know that either  liam thats why were twins  marisha thats cool  ashley i knew i came in late to the game  and there were only a couple options left  and i had never played so  i picked gnome because i was like oh thats funny  and then cleric i didnt really realize what /none/ a cleric was  and how detailed it can be if youve never played  and important to the game  so when i started i was like well shit  this is a little tougher than i thought it would be  but its been awesome i love being a cleric  liam im so glad we pulled you in  ashley me too man me too  oh also someone asked who is pikes deity  and its sarenrae the goddess of healing  and redemption among other things  matt which is carried over actually from pathfinder /none/  fifth edition has its own suggested  theres never a definitive pantheon  but they have the deity pantheon  but were carrying over pathfinder deities  that were prominently in the campaign up to this certain point  because why the hell not  were not gonna make her change her deity  that would be weird  marisha travis how did you pick your character  travis what  oh  i asked what the biggest playable character was i think  one that liked to fight drink and fight  liam one of the greatest pleasures /none/ for me  and im obviously a huge nerdlinger  and this is just me reliving high school  when i was talking to sam about starting all this  and saying hey lets get together  its what i wanna do for my birthday  we pulled travis in travis is fucking tight  look at him  hes not the stereotypical dd player  and he was as snake bitten as the rest of us  play dungeons  dragons please play dungeons  dragons  travis it was so good  ashley its the best  liam /none/ itll make you so happy  orion what about you  keyleth  marisha i remember at the time i had a  we were playing another campaign  and i had like a rogue assassin  that you were in with me  and i had a kind of assassin character  who was super seductress and really high charisma  and i remember when i joined this game  i didnt really know any of you guys  really all that well  and i was kind of new to this world  so i ended up going /none/ with a kind of druid  and i kind of deliberately made her introvert  in a weird way to kind of reflect my newcoming  to the group but i was like  whoa itll be like i can be quiet  so keyleth has a really low charisma  but i kind of spin it in that shes naive  and doesnt really know  and thats why she says things like but clarence  all laugh  marisha youre just special  because shes naive and kind of quiet  so she was just different than anything /none/  ive played before  but i really love being a druid  druids are great  taliesin i played a lot in school  other than matt  i probably had the most experience playing dd  and playing roleplaying games  travis yeah you did  genius  taliesin so i was really excited by the gunslinger in pathfinder  just cause it was something i hadnt done before  so i found it the most interesting and unusual  but i was not and i also felt it was a hole within  the group that could /none/ be filled very well  liam thedouginator keeps asking you matt  how you brought the party together  the first day of play  marisha wait we havent heard tiberius story as sorcerer  then we can answer that question  orion when this was going on  i asked matt if there was a caster yet  like any glass cannons and he said no  so i debated between a wizard and sorcerer  when we went over the different mechanics  how a wizard and a sorcerer works  i was more drawn to that  /town/ and im a huge rpg guy  liam youre so entertaining  orion to piggyback a quick question  to seal off the tiberius thing  somebody asked if any of our voice acting  influences our characters  tiberius absolutely  i played elminster aumar in the neverwinter mmo  which is a dd mmo  and when we started this  im essentially doing elminster  but i made him super bubbly  taliesin no someone asked how the group yeah  matt we got together first session essentially  was in a swamp town named stillben  /town/ and the group at the time had  for their own separate reasons  been in this town needing money  and had kind of come together as a mercenary group  out of necessity  so the first session was them having known each other  from a circumstance where they all ended up helping out  an individual in the city long story short  they had a small rapport  and knew at least each other were useful  and needed cash  and there was a job board in the town  so the first session /town/ was them being hired  to look into a conspiracy within this swamp  port town stillben  that was their first real adventure together  and when that finished they kept going from there  orion uh troll penis story  ashley troll penis  all laugh  marisha thats fair  orion i know you guys keep asking  liam take it away mercer  matt there was a battle  subterranean battle that involved the party  sneaking upon a group of two trolls that were around a fire  the idea to work past this came /none/ to tiberius  to transform himself visually into a female troll  so he could bugs bunny them  hey boys you know that thing  not knowing the temperament of trolls  especially ones that are deep underground  and dont get to see female trolls very often  they immediately just got extremely aggressive  and he found himself almost between  a rock and a hard place  orion i was getting raped by trolls  matt the party then descended upon these trolls  and in the middle of battle at numerous times  i believe /none/ percy once and laura the other  both took specific shots at each trolls dick  rolled a good shot with enough damage to blow them off  now being a troll they regenerate  but it was still a good effect and when the battle was over  it was decided by the party to at least  take one as a trophy and place it in the bag of holding  travis that was decided by me thank you  matt by grog and as such it stayed for a while  until it was used as an /none/ implement of distraction  in another encounter i believe  travis it worked  matt yeah it worked  that was where troll dick came from  orion it was spitroasting  liam jake bodro asked whats it like playing  for three hours in front of 2500 people  i think our games have gotten a little bit better  only because when we play privately  there were sometimes lulls where we werent sure what to do  we would go off to bathroom we would take a break  but now theres a little bit of the /none/ element of theater to it  just a sprinkle of it  and it kinda of gooses the energy up  orion im doing the same thing for the record  travis i keep seeing this one  for the 11 year old sadie  the son of odin shall have that cookie  matt aw thats sweet  ashley there you go  matt there is one bag of holding in the group  and grog always has it  travis a troll dick and a bulette tongue  matt there are many things that go into the bag /none/  travis it hasnt gone in that bag  taliesin is there still a cow in the bag  travis no dork the ox  matt dork the ox is probably not  travis thats when we first learned its limitations  matt why does scanlan have so many awesome spells  bards in fifth edition have one  of the options they can choose  as they level up  can choose a couple of spells from any spellcasting class  which is great and the boon that bards kinda needed to be  more combateffective  and you /none/ can choose the school of lore  or the school of combat i think for the bard  he chose the school of lore which allows you  even more spells from other classes  to boost your repertoire  so he became a fucking amazing bard  liam also sam riegel did a lot of a capella in college  travis he did he really did  liam he helped write several seasons of the voice  which was all about a capella  so samis sort of a ringer for the bard class  matt yeah kinda had /none/ to happen that way  travis can marisha do her dwarf impersonation  marisha nope  liam yordee yorda  marisha yorda youree yourdee yourd  ashley someone asked if grog could keep  one of his women in the bag of holding  you cant put living things in the bag of holding  taliesin as weve learned  matt you can marisha with dork  matt they just die  travis theres no air its like a vacuum  a magical vacuum  matt dork the ox did not survive  travis one giant dead ox came out /none/ of the bag  liam someone keeps asking if any of us  have hirelings or henchmen  and the simple answer to that is no  matt thats not true  liam just trinket  orion at our keep  taliesin we do  liam oh thats right  travis yeah we battletested them  orion we have a keep back in  liam right before we started  travis the game before we came here  after they saved the kingdom of eman  the sovereign uriel taldorei iii  as part of his gift to the group /none/  for essentially saving his family  and the city itself had a keep constructed for them  and took about six months or so  and the keep was finished  and then the partys first session  was them finding who theyre going to hire  to take care of the keep for them  liam it was like one episode of the sims  matt kind of  it was great too cause grogs whole idea  of making them to see who would be the better hire  was to break the pool cue and be /none/ like  who survives  make them fight it was pretty great  taliesin for tone17 i played a modified malkavian  and a smetty if you can believe such a thing  which was badass  matt there you go  liam weve been playing for two and a half years  someone wanted to know how long  taliesin oh my god really  travis did we tell them about your podcast  with the recording of the very first one  liam if you want sam and i its kind of languishing  but we have a /none/ podcast together called allworknoplay  travis its amazing  liam were both parents we have kids  so we have no time to do anything  enough time to take a shit  the first or second episode  the first episode is about us playing the first game  and theres audio from the first game  again go to itunes or to allworknoplay on pod bean  and youll hear about two minutes of us  dealing with a puzzle that matt threw at us  marisha it was timed  liam yeah it was timed there was /none/ an hourglass going off  it was us discovering dd really for the first time  allworknoplay all one word  marisha actually one of my favorite stories  that i tell all the time is about you  from our first game cause if you remember i didnt play  i just kinda helped matt help you guys  i was like a dd minion  and i remember i was helping you  and i remember you were like  so if i just wanted to go up and punch those guards  i could do that  /none/ and i was like yeah well you would go up  and you would punch them  and then matt would tell you how youd do that  and then you went like this you were like  travis computing  marisha yeah you were like so we can do anything  all laugh  marisha and i was like yeah  liam taliesin on game one was actually not percy  he was a dragonborn paladin  taliesin i was a dragonborn paladin  liam you fucking blew our minds we were like  what do i do  /none/ can i do damage points to stop this puzzle  there was this tunnel with all these moving parts  we thought we were gonna be crushed  and he was a dragonborn for the first episode  its in the recording on the the allworknoplay podcast  and he just breathed ice on this waterbased  taliesin contraption  liam and froze it and everyone was like  you can do that  you cant just roll dice and hit it  and thats when we kind of understood  oh its whatever the fuck you want  taliesin /none/ that was such a good game for learning  the basic mechanics  such a well put together game  orion matt does control the music while we play  matt yes i have playlists  they were much more broad playlists before  unfortunately on the stream  we have to use only approved royaltyfree music  so it took me a while to figure it out previous to this  travis i do miss those madonna songs  matt i know  i used to play a lot of bush  marisha hey would that count as fan /none/ art  if fans made us music  travis yeah  marisha could we then use that  yeah hes nodding  zac they can send us whatever they want  marisha some consent forms yeah  travis if one of your characters died would you roll a new character  orion music people out there  marisha any music people  anything atmospheric  liam no no thats an important question  travis ignore it  liam no its important  someones asking if we die  would we roll in a new character  and plus we just /none/ started this show  so part of us were wondering like  what if we die the second episode  what happens  we recorded this opening to the show thats coming  matt so heres how i run the world  i feel that one of the problems in some rpgs  is that death becomes flippant when magic  allows you to completely undo it  in my campaigns certain powerful spells  like greater restoration resurrection  things like that are a challenge  meaning you can definitely undo death  but a lot of it is /none/ based on your capabilities  as a spellcaster  your attachment to the people youve been traveling with  so if ever a character does die  a resurrection can be attempted but it is a challenge  which means theres a possibility of it failing  in which case if the resurrection fails  the soul is lost the character is permanently dead  the player then can leave and never come back  if they want to  but they have the option to create a new character  and be reintroduced to the campaign  like half /none/ a level lower than the rest  ashley that would suck so much  liam when pike died we had all of us  many series of dice rolls to do  and it was very storybased  marisha yeah people are asking how she came back  liam yeah i mean luckily we were in a big city  there was a huge temple  there were very wise clerics who were good  at bringing people back  but still we all had to roll  there was three rounds we had to roll  he might have /none/ fudged numbers i dont know  but we were all still scared  we had to all the majority of us  had to have good rolls three times in a row  scanlan had to put  travis the tears of three women in the room  liam the tears scanlan had to kiss her on the head  he put a figure that he carved of her  it was very elaborate  this one was majorly in tears  laura was in tears  ashley i was in tears  taliesin laura was hyperventilating  orion and /none/ when that was going on i remember  when that went off being still tiberius  i was like in half character but half not  and i was not crying i was like grumbles  the whole time  and as soon as she sprung back to life  because the cleric  matt breathed in her first breath after that  orion we luckily because i know it was a tight roll  matt it was a very tight roll  it was a dc of 14 in the final roll  and because scanlan brought out this /none/ figure of her  that he had carved for her like two months beforehand  as a gift sets it down and kisses her on the forehead  and it was kinda the final connection point  he needed 14 he rolled a 12 but because he  theres a plus two modifier to the skill check being a bard  and that was what he needed he just made it  basic basic  liam someones asking if we drink while playing  and the answer is no  all laugh  travis its just water in those tankards /none/  taliesin coffee  marisha i almost did yeah  orion when she came back to life is when tiberius  i was like oh my god shes okay  ashley i think also having  because with magic and everything like that  just bringing somebody back to life so easily  since we dont have that as much as maybe other games  its heightened so every time someone gets hurt  were all i think now after having that death  all of us are like where are you at  where are you at  orion /none/ where are you going  i wish i could turn to sam but hes not here  ashley were all so stressed out now which is  its kinda cool  matt mortalitys a real thing you have to deal with  and up until pikes death it was kind of  a thing people werent considering  it just happened so suddenly  liam one i see keep coming up since we started is  how would we react to life if we were our characters  i dont know or differently from our characters  cause i wouldnt /none/ stab my children when they frustrate me  matt id be in a padded room  all laugh  marisha i feel like everyone tries to make decisions  in a game that their character would make in real life  cause thats kind of the point  i take into consideration that i have shitty charisma  whenever i open my mouth  i feel like we all try and take into consideration  our background and our alignment  because thats you know  taliesin i feel significantly more badass than my character  orion i feel  /none/ tiberius is just me with magic  so thats how i feel  travis grog was easy he makes bad decisions  which is just all that i do  matt pike died when they were fighting  what was called a treachery demon  or a glabrezu  which had basically infiltrated the  sovereign uriel and the city of emon  and when it revealed its final form  it got one lucky critical hit on pike  when she was too close and just instantly took her out  thats how she died  someones asking if /none/ they can laughs  send us equipment we need for the show  zac  zac yeah they can  matt what do you need  zac well put it on the wishlist  matt there you go its on the wishlist  orion theres a wishlist  matt i didnt know there was one but now there is  zac castle greyskull on there  liam how do we feel about team demihooman  and inspiring them to play dd for the first time  i think the number one reason we all wanna do this  is because /none/ we love each other and we love this game  the second thing is we all knew  we kind of felt like  were gonna make dungeons  dragons cool again  matt try at least  liam and make it open for anyone to do  theres no reason not to do this  if theres someone you know who doesnt understand it  dont worry about it  just find some friends and connect with them  matt i find one of the difficult things  is explaining to somebody who has never played an rpg  /town/ or a game of dd at all theyre like  how does it work what is it  and its hard to explain so if anything  now we have an example with this show  other than the it crowd episode  or the community episode  which are both great examples for quick little  succinct things  taliesin if we had the power to bring one guest player  for one session  orion oh thats easy  tom hanks for sure  all laugh  marisha mazes and madness  zac everyone is asking for you /none/ guys  to somehow get vin diesel  marisha i was gonna say vin diesel  orion he lives for this shit  matt vin diesels good  top of my list is stephen colbert  because i know he also plays  ashley that would be amazing  taliesin i would love to see joss whedon do this  i admit i would like to see joss whedon play dd  thatd be interesting  zac that might be possible  taliesin okay im throwing that one out there  orion what tom hanks isnt  marisha felicias got /none/ some  matt but hes also a super fuckin busy man  orion guys tweet at tom hanks to come play with us  travis im morgan freeman and i rolled a one  matt right now critical role hanks  see if we can make it trend  patton oswalt would be great  orion thatd be hilarious  zac what about dan harmon  just so i can get fired can we do that  all laugh  matt yeah  hardwick used to play dd with patton oswalt  in the mid2000s  i cant even imagine /none/ what those games were like  orion id like to like  amy poehler id like to have one of those  zac she might be open to that  shes a partner with legendary  orion id love her tina tina fey  liam someone keeps asking about troy  i dont know if troy baker is ready  orion i dont think hes ready for this jelly  you guys think hes ready for this jelly  i dont think so  matt whenever it comes up in conversation  troy always gives me that look of like /none/  all right  travis you can see him swimming in the infinity of  marisha thats not cool  liam he has some preconceived notions  marisha my scarves are cooler than you  matt once we get him like a proper  plus two enchanted scarf  ashley can we ship grog and vex  travis grog and vex  no im here to annoy vex by smacking her bear around  and shes here to tell me not to kill myself  dont jump into the crevasse its 1000 feet deep  ashley troy baker is pikes /none/ distanced dad  all laugh  matt thats pretty funny  liam answer this question i like  i saw it a couple times  how did you guys get involved in streaming  for geek  sundry  travis virgin sacrifice  matt the best way i know that happened was  we had been playing for a while  and we all work in the industry  people began to hear about our voiceover dd game  weirdly  like id come into sessions with directors  ive never worked with before theyd be like  oh yeah /none/ youre the guy that runs that dd game  how did that happen how is that my thing  im cool with it like heck yeah  my little high school self is like  im okay with being known about that  but then over time eventually geek  sundry contacted us  felicia had heard about it  they called me in for a meeting  and we spent a number of months  trying to figure out what format we were gonna try  if we wanna do it like multi camera  filmed canned episodes  /none/ then eventually the twitch possibility came up  and we were like no  this is a much better format for us  and thats kind of how it happened  liam are you kosher with me  you took this film theres a video of you  breaking the news to us that geek  sundry  came to you about it  are you kosher with me sharing that video  matt yeah i dont see why not  liam all right ill find a way to put it  through my twitter  so just keep your /none/ eye on my twitter  ashley wait what are you sharing  liam there was a video that orion took  when matt told us about geek  sundry coming to him  and us all sort of toasting and laughing  orion reacting  liam giggling like idiots  matt why is dd pathfinder making you so much more  attached to the characters than a regular rpg  if you mean like a video game rpg  i mean you get attached either way  but with this because you are so much more fluid  with how /dung/ you can influence the world  and the character and the way the character reacts  to the world and how it can influence it is so much more  marisha personal  matt personal a good way of putting it  its just that much more involving  and you invest so much into that atmosphere  and it depends on the group  some people just like to do dungeon crawls  and kill and get loot and experience  and thats totally cool too  for me at least  i like em both for different reasons /none/  i still play the crap out of video game rpgs  liam someone asked if given the chance  would we like to do a live game  at a convention like acquisition inc  id like to do although theres nine of us  so thatd be kind of  ashley thatd be a long game  zac we may be asking you guys to do that soon  liam oh good then yes  matt as long as youre handling the tech  i think wed be fine with that  liam id like to do it /none/  zac we may be streaming from comic con  i dont know  we may be asking if you guys are gonna  go through that hell hole  liam the answer is yes  orion can we get a jib i like crane shots  marisha ooh  ashley a helicopter a helicopter shot  orion put it on the wishlist  zac put it on the wishlist a jib  liam how many of you aside from matt  have run a game of dd or another rpg  in high school i ran a dd game /none/  i ran a rifts game for a little while  matt rifts yes  liam i ran a cyberpunk game for a little while  travis really  liam yes  the last two months i have been helping  my eightyearold son and two of his friends  from school create characters  and i wouldnt have done this if matt  had not forced this shit into my life  i wouldnt have done this  but im about to start running a game for my son  the halfelf druid and his two friends  the /none/ dragonborn fighter and the dragonborn rogue  travis what if they die  liam thats just how the cookie crumbles motherfucker  travis oh man you are teaching life lessons  marisha gotta teach lessons  travis go fish and then dd  taliesin i ran a rifts game as well in high school  then i ran a game of vampire the masquerade  and i was in a bunch of them  liam of course you did  taliesin couple rounds of paranoia and hole  because thats funny  hole was amazing  matt which you gave /none/ me books for  for my birthday which was awesome  marisha i was a part of a buffy the vampire slayer  tabletop rpg for a while  yeah its actually quite fun  i was a pyromancer  orion somebody asked a fun one they asked if we play  whats our favorite video game  marisha whats our favorite video games  oh thats a hard question  orion is it  marisha theres so many  orion well we can skip it  liam metal gear dragon age  ashley probably portal portal or dragon age /none/  matt portals great  liam castlevania symphony of the night  i played til i had blisters on my thumbs  matt symphony of the night yeah dude  what is a man  taliesin borderlands 2 and im happy  ashley borderlands 2  liam pool of radiance on my commodore 64  orion oh shit  liam baldurs gate which i played again on my ipad  a year or two ago  somebody oh go ahead  orion i was just saying  liam somebody asked how we focus in the room  with the sexual /none/ magnetism that is scanlan shorthalt  ashley ooh its tough man  liam i dont know  taliesin i wear a codpiece  i wear a codpiece that keeps everything in check  matt im heavily sedated most of the game  just for that reason  otherwise the clothes would just come right off  liam i just let myself get a gigantic boner every week  matt does anyone play league  generally marisha sometimes  were playing heroes of the storm more now  orion im a big final fantasy fan  i like all kinds of /none/ games  i definitely would say if i had to pick one rpg  cause im an rpg guy i love chrono cross  thatd be my favorite game  ive played that more than i have chrono trigger  which is way too many times  travis dragon age raceclass  ash anybody that plays  matt elf rogue  taliesin human fighter  travis always the mage  liam travis stupid question thor odinson  or hulk in a knock down drag out  travis oh scoffs  orion type0 also dammit  travis contractually thor realistically hulk /none/  i mean i am thor i cant say any other guy  taliesin hulks on a scaling power level  cause he just gets too mad  travis yeah lets just be real about that  thats hulk  matt tried new final fantasy yet  ashley chocolatesweets a bunch of times has asked  would you guys consider cosplay for the games  taliesin well technically  we already did  marisha youll see maybe next week  matt hes trying the best he can  we have an intro coming up some point soon  zac halfway /none/ done  matt halfway done we all shot loosely in character costumes  inspired by everyones characters  so youll be able to see that soon  taliesin if anyone would like to make us costumes  liam one man doing it all  travis a million arms  ashley i think it would be kinda hard for me  to play the game in cosplay  cause i have probably the most armor now  matt you do  you wear the most armor  orion thats a cool question  if you had to switch characters matt  /dung/ if you had to switch characters  which one would you be  marisha if you had to trade places with one of us  orion yeah if you would switch characters  zac that question was matt included  question was for everyone  if you guys could switch characters with anyone  who would you pick  including matt  ashley i would probably switch with liam or travis  taliesin tiberius would be mine id take tiberius  liam scanlan i would be scanlan  matt i would be scanlan bards man  bards are my favorite /none/ class  marisha id be probably either scanlan or pike  travis id be trinket  matt yeah you would  travis why are you peeing on everything  marisha bards and clerics are great  orion id definitely be grog  just the complete opposite of what i can do  taliesin im a wow player on occasion i havent played in ages  orion for the horde  matt player wants to play a lizardfolk monk  whats my opinion about the idea  thats fine i mean a player can play  whatever they want to  /none/ as long as you as the dm want it in your campaign  just make sure they have more to their character  besides im a lizard monk  have a good reason why they trained as a monk  if they make a cool personality behind it  work it into the social structure  of their lizardfolk people  and see whether the monks will be shunned or accepted  are they an outcast of the society  think of those ideas  and make a cool character based on the story  from a fighting standpoint  /none/ thatd be cool  i used to play a  lizard monk in ruins of kunark back in the old eq days  oh man  that was a while back  liam someone asked when trinket came into the mix  day one  travis day one  she had that shit like that  she knew she wanted a pet bear  marisha he hasnt died yet  orion he hasnt died its amazing  this thing has not died  he should have died so many times  matt she spent all of her character focus  /none/ in having a pet from combat  and then never puts it in combat  because she doesnt want it to get killed  and its fucking hilarious  travis we put it jeopardy situations before  matt yeah you have  every time she goes never again  and im like all right well  taliesin the day that bear dies its gonna get ugly  ashley its gonna be bad  orion its good to change her as a character  travis alignment shift  taliesin so much black to wear  marisha douginator asked me a super /none/ detailed question  so i dont wanna blow over it cause it was awesome  he asked me how my path has gone  and my personal aramente journey  and how working with the group has helped  and slowed it down  for the air ashari and for keyleths journey  its kind of expected to take her maybe ten  maybe 20 years  it takes her like the aramente is expected  to take a long time  and part of it is her kind of proving herself a hero  so she kind of ended /none/ up tagging along  with this motley crew in order to  kind of help her so shes not doing it alone  so its a good thing that shes tagging along  but she also has to deal with sometimes the moral  dilemma of maybe choices that she might  not normally make if she wasnt with the group  that she has to go with  liam i see two questions i wanna address  one is what is each of our favorite kill  orion i was gonna say that was a good one  liam /none/ and the second one is whats the story behind  the super high intensity team  all laugh  liam lets start with the kills  and then well get to the shits  my favorite kill i finished off a blue dragon we faced  we all chipped away at this dragon  someone who had disguised himself as human  for a long time then we came to their secret cubbyhole  and they revealed themselves  we chipped away and chipped away  then at the end i sort of parkourran up a wall  and shoved /none/ the daggers into its neck  and just slid down its entire body and finished it  orion my favorite kill is actually  liam until today  orion when pike kicked the bucket  and that moment all of us realized what happened  and there was an instant shift in real emotion  where whatever the hell  i dont even remember who we were fighting  because i went like fucking cast this  and everyones just kill this thing  because we all cared so much in a real life situation  where we hated this /none/ thing with real emotion  and we just slaughtered it  taliesin the demonpossessed royal family was my favorite  liam that was the same thing  taliesin yeah that was my favorite fight  just using the light also we were shooting  i was getting to shoot holes in the glass  matt the entire throne room had a glass dome overtop  but because the family had been possessed  by the shades these shadow entities  it was all covered  they were able to force these spirits  out of the physical bodies without killing /none/ them  by being able to tear off the cloth  or shoot holes in it to allow sunlight in  and use that as part of the battle tactic  it worked out really cool  marisha yeah that was fun  travis my favorite kill wasnt even an enemy  it was when scanlan summoned that pony  when we were facing those five wizards  all laugh  travis he summoned this pony  and then i turned and abruptly cut its fucking head off  and reached in and grabbed its organs  and smeared its /none/ gore all over myself  and started screaming  and mercer was like okay  orion the fight ended there  matt roll intimidation with a bonus  travis butchered a pony for intimidation  matt yeah it worked  marisha i think one of my favorite keyleth moments  it wasnt a kill  but when we were in the crazy michael jackson  neverland ranch sorcerer dudes plane of existence  matt the dread emperor  marisha yeah when we were in his plane of existence  and we encountered that big tree rock monster  and i /none/ just happened to take command plants  and he happened to be a plant monster  so it just worked out perfectly  and i was just like we dont wanna fight you  back down  and avoided an entire battle  taliesin getting the magic carpet was also pretty badass  marisha oh yeah that was a good story  liam another fabulous moment that you guys have to know about  is we wanted to get into a tower at one point  and there was a very intelligent sort of  righthand man to whoever owned /none/ the tower  scanlan just started fasttalking  which is his defining characteristic  took his finger and put it right here as a mustache  and said hi im burt reynolds  all laugh  liam and he rolled either scanlan rolled a 20  travis i think it was a natural  matt he rolled a natural 20  liam and you werent expecting it to work  in any way shape or form and you went  okay  travis mr reynolds  marisha burt reynolds just announced that hes  gonna be at philly wizard world /none/ with us  so we could theoretically tell him that story  matt i have to  ashley burt reynolds would be a dream guest  orion him and tom hanks  travis hed have to play on a bearskin carpet  matt the whole family history organized  ashley ive only had one kill  travis but it was what  ashley and it was a dragon  travis yeah dragonslayer  ashley but the thing that i  probably the whole battle with the family  that was sort of possessed when i actually died  that was /none/ probably one of my favorite battles  maybe not after i died prior to  when i got to finish off the dragon  taliesin was that on christmas  ashley the dragon yes  that night was so amazing because we had  we made it a winter festival  so we all came in our pajamas  it was close to christmas  thats why it was a winter festival  it was like our little christmas party  marisha our holiday episode  liam that was sad for me because it was my idea  but i /none/ had health problems at the time  and i had to bow out  and i was very very very sad  matt but you made it to this years  i made it the following year yeah  taliesin yeah we had a whole little thing it was really nice  matt i would love to play dd with dame judy dench  marisha heck yeah  matt you guys can tweet at her so you can get her to agree  liam the shits  how did we become the shits  matt yes  so the party /none/ had run into a  debearded actually shaven dwarf named grimthorn  who wanted to represent them for  what is occasionally a roving brawling guild  essentially  like underground fighting rings that happen  around the world at different points throughout the year  it may come up again well see  but they had to think of a team name  and scanlan  recommended the super high intensity team  which stuck for a while so the group name  against the better judgement of i think  a lot of the group became the shits /none/  so their name for a while was the shits  they were announced as the shits in the ring  when they won the tournament  that was when the pony was cut in half  to intimidate the opposing team  travis scanlans idea also  orion tiberius and keyleth were not happy  matt shits stuck for a while until eventually  they got rid of the shits  as all of a sudden they were about to go to the  winter festival parade in their honor  for saving the entire city of eman  /none/ and the sovereign uriel said  what should we announce you as  and it was decided not to announce you guys  in front of the city at your parade as the shits  ashley i was super into it  still love the shits  matt instead the name became vox machina  so if youve heard them say that  thats the official team name  theyve created for themselves as a group  orion with credit to sam as well  which was voted down was also  the brotherhood of the sisterhood  which i /none/ was a huge fan of  i really wanted it to be the brotherhood of the sisterhood  but vox machina sounded cooler  ashley the brotherhood of the sisterhood of the order  or something like that  marisha the order of the brotherhood of the sisterhood  orion so tiberius recognizes as the  vox machinabrotherhood of the sisterhood  liam largosensei keeps asking  what are your most cathartic voice acting experiences  im gonna guess for ashley thats the last of us  since thats your fucking heart ripped out of your chest  ashley probably /none/ yeah  liam gollum was pretty sad for me  because hes a miserable bastard  also angel from wolverine the xmen  orion wait does cathartic mean sad  liam well it just means get your fucking demons out  chew it up  taliesin mines really old  its probably either monster or paranoia agent  im gonna go that far back  yeah all the way back  matt fate zero for me had a moment  that was pretty intense emotionally  that i really enjoyed  travis knuckles the echidna in sonic  all laugh /none/  matt sonic boom yo  marisha boom sonic boom  travis whats that  liam infamous maybe  travis oh yeah  liam

completing an actual real life dream goal  ive said this a couple times before  but the last day i was recording the last stuff  i was literally crying on the /dung/ way home  because i finally got to level myself up  and this thing kept it up and it was really cool  travis matt who were you in fate0  matt im kiritsugu kiritsugu emiya  travis bless you  matt thank you  thats the dark assassin character  taliesin saw a question about percys home  and his family  percy has a really really big family  that i dont mention in the video  and he has not been home yet  he has no interest in going home yet  cause thats terrifying /none/  so we have not dealt with that  matt thats going to be interesting when that comes around  travis whats under the freakin lake  liam whats under the freakin lake matt  marisha yeah whats under the lake  matt you were told  orion yeah its one of those big  matt aboleth  marisha oh yeah thats right i did write it down  matt which you encountered one underground  marisha yes i was a shark  matt put the slime into the water  you could only breathe water and couldnt breathe air /none/  marisha remember cause i was like  im gonna be crafty and turn into a shark  and then i started immediately drowning  orion how do you keep players from getting op matt  matt make the monsters more powerful  orion behind the scenes  im always constantly up his ass  trying to make tiberius as op as possible  and hes always stopping me a lot  matt balance is important  i mean the characters  everyone here has really good characters  that have a lot of cool abilities  but they also /none/ have a lot of challenges  that come at them that make them  not only use those abilities but also  monsters can have cool abilities too  liam bracheon89 you said stephen king plays dd  ashley yes thats what i was trying to say  what  liam bracheon were going to wait for your answer  how do you know he plays dd  ashley are you sure  liam lets get him in here  matt id love that  taliesin the groups worst decision in dd was the dragon  i think  marisha /none/ oh yeah grog  taliesin grog  travis listen there was a shitload of gold  ashley i still dont think that was a bad idea  orion oh when he started hoarding all the gold  marisha we still dont know if that  liam takes a lot of stupid  marisha he might have been an ally  we might have killed someone who was valuable  taliesin you were still freaking out like a month later  you were feeling really bad  travis well i did almost get us killed  ashley i feel like it /none/ was a good decision  matt to be fair  its the only time ive ever had a player  rage loot before  all laugh  matt you went into a rage and used it to just loot more  and then the dragon revealed itself  and you looked at it  and you just kept looting  all laugh  travis you guys take care of this  ashley that was hilarious matt thats grog  liam somebody keeps asking  and well do a show of hands here  lord of the rings or game of /none/ thrones  ashley oh come on  marisha ooh thats tough  liam what do you prefer  10 seconds to think about it and then ill  taliesin thats like star trek or star wars  marisha yeah hard  liam theyre asking the question  zac dont be afraid come on  travis thats tough  liam lord of the rings fuckin lord of the rings  there you go theres the answer  ashley i dont know man  taliesin lord of the rings but i see game of thrones on the side  liam i love /none/ game of thrones  marisha of course we do  travis lord of the rings  taliesin we wouldnt have game of thrones  without lord of the rings  marisha thats the thing  liam maybe possibly not dungeons  dragons  without lord of the rings  ashley this is true its the og  i dont know what that even  taliesin you said that  that just came out of your mouth  ashley please lets leave it alone  moving on  travis thats the og  ashley what is this what do we have /none/ over here  well who was the old gnome that grog saved  in his intro video  liam pikes daddy  ashley no that was my great great grandfather  travis thats right  ashley yes great great grandfather wilhand  travis wilhelm hand wilhand  ashley thats right  liam wilhand the money  travis grog has an intelligence of six hes gonna get names wrong from time to time  liam everybody if you could choose whatever fantasy world  to live in what would it be  travis marvel  taliesin ooh  orion i would /none/ live in the  next generation world universe  taliesin you had me at marvel  travis yeah  zac heres the thing  you could live in marvel what you live in  if you couldnt live in that world as a superhero  just as a normal person  travis right not in new york  anybody that lives in new york  in the marvel universe is just stupid  like rents gotta be 150  taliesin terrible idea  matt id say myst  so i can just write my own worlds  to infinity from /none/ there  liam lord of the rings  matt or amber as well  ashley i was gonna say lord of the rings  maybe rivendell  marisha im gonna say final fantasy 10  matt grey havens  if youre gonna do lord of the rings do grey havens  cause youre far enough away from mordor  where its generally not gonna be a problem  liam i wanna be one of the fellowship  ashley johnson lived in a marvel universe already right  matt thats true  orion see and its a big hassle  marisha /none/ it was a big hassle  orion yeah  matt before the stream our dd session  marisha high insurance rates  matt before the stream our dd sessions  would happen once every month to month and a half  more like month and a half  liam why is matt scarlet witch  matt im down with it  cause i alter reality  power makes sense  our sessions used to be once every month  or month and a half  and they would be about six to eight hours  but the problem is wed /dung/ play so infrequently  every session id have to remind everyone what happened  and it was hard to schedule  part of the reason were even doing this show  is because its technically work  which allows those of us who have families  and children more of an excuse to come more often  so yeah  liam googoo17 arkazey keeps asking  whats your favorite nerdy tshirt you own  mine is one that says mordor world tour  it looks like a rock n roll tshirt  but it says mordor world tour  marisha /none/ thats cool  favorite nerdy tshirt  taliesin ive got a sons of anarchy doctor who tshirt  im a really big fan of  ill wear it next week  marisha ive got like an army kind of soldiery  looking tshirt that says chimera like chimera corps  matt thats actually the one i was gonna say  thats my favorite shirt too  marisha i like your displacer kitty youve got  matt displacer kittys kind of cool  adorable  taliesin i like your shine on me shirt  matt oh god  if you guys /none/ havent watched  chris dane owens on youtube  chris dane owens shine on me  its a music video watch it  chris dane owens shine or shine on me youtube do it  taliesin i love that you own the shirt from it  matt i bought a shirt from it cause its that amazing  i had to  travis did anyone tell pike that scanlan  killed the naga for her  matt i dont think someones done it yet  liam scanlan had his first kill  you saw it right  matt you saw /none/ it on the stream  ashley i saw it me ashley saw it  but pike did not hear about it yet  who knows that could be the thing  that seals the deal  ill be like you killed the naga  okay lets do this  all laugh  marisha any betrayals in the game  matt no betrayals disagreements and occasional  travis trippings and beatdowns  matt and stealing of flying carpets  ashley i actually did step  i kind of did hurt liam one game  or vax  liam the game we /none/ played together  we did just the two of us one night  ashley there were some of the girls changing in a room  matt i forgot about this  liam i was very curious to see you naked  but thats kinda fallen on the wayside  ashley vax was very curious to see  what a gnome looked like naked  liam never seen it before  marisha so you did a little peeping tom  liam why wouldnt i wanna expand my horizons  matt so he rolled stealth  ashley so he rolled stealth and /none/ he did and saw or whatever  and then when i came back out and i found out about it  liam looked good it was compact  ashley it was just a small human  and i think i stepped on your foot  and gave you some damage  liam maybe a hit point  ashley yeah a hit point or two  matt you earned it  ashley i earned it  orion somebody seagullblaster  liam no vax didnt spy on vex sorry go ahead  orion asked tiberius said something about the palestone  and /none/ what it is and this is  somebody asked a different question  this is kinda gonna answer both  i and everybody else  wrote backstories for matthew  to essentially give him so he could construct our universe  tiberius particular quest  is looking for particular artifacts  essentially i made him like mulder  nobody believes in the city that these things exist  except him so the truth is out there kinda thing  so i made up these five different artifacts  that do different things  and i dont know what they do /none/ until  i might maybe find them and if i do  its up to him to matt to determine what they are  if they are anything  they might be nothing i dont know  ive found one item so far and its awesome  and all of us have given him bits and pieces  and thats how he constructs our story  with things that you throw in yourself  matt yeah and each player  all their story lines work into the world  not all of them will happen immediately of course  some /none/ people have had personal encounters  and story encounters already some are yet to occur  and there will be points throughout the campaign  where the party will probably have to move  and individually deal with each persons story  to some extent  marisha dealt a little bit with each person  matt touched a little bit like  in eman weve seen vex and vaxs father  liam vex and i ran into to our father again  for the first time in many years  it was a little frosty  matt had a new /none/ family  liam have a little half sister  travis matt you have a favorite voice  and does it hurt to do the gnarly monster voice  matt if you do it for an extended period of time  it can be kind of shitty  ashley i dont know how you do this new one  travis breathing in and out  liam thats inward singing man  travis it is inward singing  liam and then im fucking singing  and then  matt actually its funny  a bunch of my npcs that ive done since /none/ high school  have ended up turning into characters ive booked  ill go into an audition and be like  ill go ahead and do nutibe curios  from my second campaign  and ill end up doing that character  alof in pillars is a character i npced  back in high school  liam thats awesome  taliesin they still havent heard my favorite voice  from this campaign yet  cause we havent gone back to the city yet  matt oh gilmore  liam gilmore is a wonderful magician who owns a shop  orion /none/ was that the fancy  liam yes in the city of eman  hes got a big friggin crush on me and wants me  wants me and some day you and i will actualize that  matt well have to roleplay that  liam maybe in a game maybe not  travis what do we think is taking over the hive mind  matt what do you guys think is taking over the hive mind  marisha well we know its named  orion obviously some butthole  ashley i think i might have an idea  travis yeah /none/ you had a vision that we dont even  know about yet right  ashley well  travis taking those mushrooms having those visions  ashley taking those mushrooms  liam someone asked how do game devs find us  for acting work  we all audition hundreds of people audition  for every role in los angeles we all just try  today i worked on a superhero game  and the guy who was directing me for voiceover said  hey so what are you doing for the rest of the day  and i said well im /none/ gonna go to the gym  im gonna do this then im gonna go do that  do you know about that dd show  that a couple of us are doing  and hes like yeah i heard about that  and the guy who had written the game went  yeah ive watched every episode  all laugh  matt so awesome  taliesin thats so cool  ashley someone wants to hear gilmores voice  taliesin i think we should save that for  wait until they actually meet gilmore  travis yeah we cant give it /none/ away  matt gilmores a fun one  ashley gilmores awesome  matt gilmore is very broadway  hes very  taliesin not the gargoyle  matt no no  i could see him being a character in a john waters film  taliesin oh my god yeah  ashley totally  liam give him a pencilthin mustache  matt yeah  taliesin im trying to catch up  travis greater overall motivations  matt that may or may not be secret  depending on the characters  marisha what is each persons favorite dd monster  travis a dead /none/ one  liam i liked it when grog got it on with a  what was it a nymph  travis what  matt yeah  travis you dont know man i went through the portal  handled my business like a champ  liam in the air  travis i dont kiss and tell  nobody knows  i got what we were supposed to get  liam a nymph could have attacked us  but grog looked her in the eye  and she liked what she saw  then he disappeared for a little while  and /dung/ he came back and he was in a really good mood  travis i flashed her the look man  she was mine what can i say  taliesin i like the little green gelatinous cubes  i think theyre fun and then if you make em right  you can just make em out of jello  and eat them when youre done thats awesome  matt i dont wanna answer that question necessarily  because i might be using them in the campaign  at some point  orion which one  matt nothing  ashley so that /none/ means we havent used em yet  matt but overall i just love the tarrasque  because its like the game ender  its the godzilla  its the one dms move where hes like  im done with this campaign hey guys  youre gonna fight a tarrasque either youre all gonna die  or you beat it and you beat the game  so the tarrassque is always fun  orion is it the final boss  liam ive always been fascinated with the mind flayers  youre fucking throwing an army of them at us  cause /none/ theyre dangerous  matt yeah theyre terrible  liam and theyre so outside of the norm  matt and hey you stealthed up  and pretty much killed one in one round today  orion that was insane  when the mud on the face  and the stab in the fucking back of the head  matt you guys black opsed that entire barracks  liam im proud of the knife  taliesin i know what youre talking about  travis grog and scanlan have no bastard children  that we know of  or that you can prove /none/  liam other streamed dd games  like rollplay hosted by itmejp  travis no  liam no  maybe we will though  orion i wont  liam everyone play dungeons  dragons  ashley my favorite npc character is  a little butler who i think became  travis yes  ashley hes the cutest little thing you will ever see  and i think now he works at  taliesin he works for us now  matt yep you guys hired him  and hes currently helping keep your keep in good shape  ashley whats his /none/ name  orion the old fellow right  matt im trying to remember ill have to go look at the list again  i have so many npcs i have a hard time  ashley hes just the sweetest little thing  you ever did see  matt grogs flatlined intelligence  anything like that happen before  that was the first of that type of situation  travis i went unconscious once cause i fell  how far did i fall  taliesin wow you fell  orion oh that was a crazy one too  matt they were /none/ there fighting in an underground cavern  and at the very very top of this giant  like 170foot ceiling  which they had all kinda floated up to  and put a rope anchor in  travis i was ready to toro the bull  matt the first umber hulk you guys ever encountered  ended up pushing grog out of the hole  bullrushing him  had the rope tied around his waist  but unfortunately grog weighs about 600 pounds  rope snapped  and he took enough damage to go from full health  to unconscious /none/ and bleeding out in one round  marisha cause he confused you right  and you just harikaried off the hole  travis i was gonna dodge and be all awesome  and say ole or some shit but i was just out  marisha that was when i was a spider tiger  cause i cast spider climb on myself  and i was in tiger form  so i was spider climbing all over the place  matt thats also one of my favorite risky rolls  which was after that happened  tiberius you pushed the umber /none/ hulk onto the ground  or through the hole it fell  orion i had this amazing spell with pathfinder  called aquasphere orb and you can like  capture large creatures  i literally can waterbend a sphere  and carry this dude and drop them down  it was amazing i miss it so much  continue the story  matt so essentially tiberius decided  cause grog was unconscious  and the creature was down there  all of them were stuck 170 feet up  in this little hive essentially  tiberius said fuck it he /none/ jumped out of the hole  swan dove down and cast featherfall on himself  at the last minute  had to make a concentration check  because of the wind rushing past  and having to cast a spell while falling  its a very difficult thing  he had about a 40 chance of success  60 chance of instant death and he made the roll  i love risky moments like that so much i love em  travis it was pretty legit  orion i did it again and held that fucker it was intense  /none/ marisha im wondering when were gonna face a beholder  matt thatll be nasty  marisha thats my favorite dd monster  orion with all the eyes  marisha theyre like a big floating head  with a giant eye and theyve got tentacles  with eyes on the end of em  and each eyeball does a different ray of effect  travis a beholder  matt nasty  travis you know what that is too  liam yeah marisha theyre nasty  ashley bad news bears  marisha theyre super awesome  one of these days were gonna /none/ fight one  matt one of these days  liam theyre a signature character of dungeons  dragons  they represent dd  travis what made the dwarves get bigger today in the battle  matt thats actually an ability of the duergar  liam viagra  matt yeah  they can summon through sheer force of will  and just the way theyve been bred over time  they can increase their form for a short time  to increase their damage  and be just a general asshole so  its an ability the duergar have  travis /none/ long lost son  liam im gonna guess that none of us have been to sweden  matt i have  ashley my dad was from sweden  matt thats awesome ive been to gothenberg  taliesin thats not surprising  orion i have not but i would like to go  marisha yeah who wouldnt want to go to sweden  liam makes sense  pale and blonde  matt have you been  ashley never been  matt its beautiful i spent two weeks in gothenberg sweden  on business years ago  it was gorgeous  food /town/ was amazing  nothing like walking down the street  and seeing a giant gothic stone structure  with an archway and a gargoyle perched  and you walk in and its a 7eleven  its pretty hilarious  all the architecture there is old  but its been repurposed its great  liam if you had to choose  would you pick to receive an extra level  or matts hair  matt god damn it liam matts hair  all laugh  ashley hair obviously  marisha receive an extra level or matts hair  travis you cant /none/ get hair like this without unicorn blood  my god  matt im gonna shave my head one of these days  liam shave his head he cant dm anymore  matt id wither  its like sampson  i would just like become this little raisin  id be david tennant  liam the beholder strikes for the mawp mawp  matt lets see  what are the questions we got up there  marisha it is 1138 by the way  liam what is the most outrageous and unexpected thing  to come from a natural 20  /none/ that was scanlan  ashley probably the  liam scanlan as burt reynolds  marisha oh right  matt well take about five more minutes of questions  five or ten more minutes of questions  then we gotta take off  liam how long will you be doing this show  30 years  matt considering weve been playing for two and a half years  and everyones level nine  we can keep going for quite some time  whether or not we continue past that  means either we do a new campaign  or we go /none/ into epic or mythic levels  well cross that bridge when we get to it  i mean id love to keep playing  for as long as people wanna play  but also people get busy life changes  well see how it goes  im in for the long haul as much as everyone else is  liam matt multiple people are asking what the music is  that were hearing on the show  matt what you hear in the show is a combination of  a gentlemen named kevin macleod  who has a website called /dung/ incompetech  which he produces really amazing  royaltyfree musical tracks  ive used them for many web series for many years  hes very talented and i contacted him  and asked him permission to use on the stream  hes like yeah anything on twitch go for it  and the other half are a lot of soundscapes i use  from a company called platemail games  which make great custom rpg soundscapes  and some tracks that are just creepy  and dwarf cityscapes and dark forest night  its a great great resource  those /none/ are my two big ones for this twitch stream  orion and yes we did roll for our starting stats  matt yeah it was 4d6 drop the lowest  arrange as desired  so it was a powerful campaign  liam what was the most nailbiting moment  the group has seen  it was pikes death  marisha pike dying  matt definitely  do you prefer being the dm  or do you like mixing it up and being characters  i never get a chance to play games really  its kind of one of those /none/ always a dm  never a bride circumstance  liam you wanna play with my kid  matt yeah  ill be an evil character and murder them all  youre going to regret it immediately  make em just cry  liam listen thats the game suck it up  matt yeah turn it into mazes and monsters  taliesin is that why you play so much war machine  is because for once you dont have to be responsible  matt probably  i occasionally  i got to play a game of diaspora for a while  /none/ with philip eisner the guy who wrote event horizon  so playing a scifi kind of horrorbased universe  with him running that was great  that was very brief  liam matt can you give us any teasers of things to come  matt no  see as they happen man  thats part of the fun the mystery of it all  i know whats coming  i got stuff planned for years  its gonna be fun  liam do you have any advice to get into voice acting  learn to act study acting go to /none/ where the work is  keep acting in anything in fucking anything  go to where the work is  act  matt what age did you play your first  tabletop rpg game  for me it was second edition dungeons  dragons  and it was freshman year of high school  taliesin gurps 13  i was yeah 13 years old gurps  ashley favorite tabletop games not dd  liam get hulk hogan to play  orion thats not dd  taliesin mansions of madness  marisha mansions of madness is great  orion is mtg /none/ magic the gathering a tabletop  is that considered tabletop  marisha its a card building game  orion magic  marisha war machine  matt war machine is really fun  marisha im a cryx player  matt its awesome  ashley im just starting  matt youre the awesome retribution  orion im circle of orboros  taliesin we played with scanlan of course we do  travis it said do you ever think about sexuality  while playing besides grog of course  scanlan does im sure other people have  taliesin its hard not to think /none/ about it with sam  travis we just pay for it  liam are we gonna release more background information  of your campaign  matt yes actually  liam we are  matt time has been hard but im trudging through  what im gonna make essentially is a video recap  of the previous two and a half years of the campaign  im gonna narrate it its gonna be very simple  its gonna be just information  with the occasional slides of stuff in the background  but im working on a video  kind of /none/ like your guys intros  thatll be a synopsis of the story  up until this stream stared  travis claymation thats awesome man  matt i will destroy you i will fucking stab you  liam if you want its not much  but i have a vine account thats under the name  voiceofobrien and i took a lot of vine videos  from our private game  so its not a ton  but youll see us acting like shitheads  travis thats seven seconds at a time  marisha seven seconds at a time yeah  /none/ i think i still have the video  of you trying to woo the nymph lady  travis try taliesin that was a good video  marisha its basically just you flirting with my boyfriend  taliesin i have some videos of the tarot game  and a couple of us  travis matt is now a nymph  matt yeah we sat there and hey man  ive had to flirt with quite a few of these people  as characters its interesting  liam whos your favorite npc that you brought to life for us  matt oh /none/ thats a tough one  theres been a lot of good ones  i really enjoyed grimthorn the dwarf that was  liam clarota is pretty good  matt yeah clarota is great  he was the one eyed dwarf with the shave  that was taking you guys to the fighting ring  he was fun  im enjoying balgus as well hes a good one  marisha ballsack  liam ballsack  marisha do we have nicknames for all of our npcs  matt you know i really enjoy arcanist allura visoren  orion so do i  /none/ matt shes an awesome powerful headstrong elven sorceress  who is part of a not a secret  but a very powerful circle of magic practitioners  around the world  and also a member of the council of taldorei  shes one of the largest allies that this group  has had through a lot of the adventure arcs  and i love playing her shes great  liam grog have you even thrown a gnome as an attack  travis the very first time we played  i picked up sam and chucked him across a room  /none/ that was full of a trap  marisha fastball special  travis and it worked  it was awesome  matt what character type would i play  if i ever got a chance to play  i would probably be a bard  i wanna make a bard that actually conducts the battle  meaning sits there and watches the fight  and hes conducting  like music happens when other people attack  cymbals go off and drum beats  and all of his abilities are tied to music  so hes actually conducting the battle like a /none/ symphony  thats what i wanna make  marisha thats cool  ashley thats badass  matt one day  liam would you ever play an evil character  my contingency plan if i get killed  i dont know about evil  but he wont be as nice as vax  matt evil characters have to be discussed with the dm  im iffy on the evil character  unless they have a good reason  and a personality that isnt going to  completely derail the campaign  doing an evil campaign thats fine  but if youre /none/ building a character  that is going to inherently be a troll  and basically diminish everybody elses  good time in the story it becomes a problem  zac its the internet though man  matt i know  if you make a cool interesting evil character  that can be evil but still like  like a good example would be in baldurs gate edwin  zac what if one of your guests  that came on for one night would they be allowed to be  matt yeah theyd be allowed to  they may not survive /none/  orion tiberius might not  marisha or kill them  liam i dont know about evil but if i have to come back  i might be a lot more selfish  matt in it cool news tabletop columnist  offering to dm a game for me  i may have to hit you up on that some time  cause thatd be awesome  taliesin he deserves a break  zac how do you remember all the voices  that youve done of the npcs over the years  matt i make notes and audio files  travis /none/ you do  matt i do  as a reminder in case i forget  travis jarvis  all laugh  matt i have notes written next to every npc  like an accent or dialect that i chose for them  a general texture  kind of like what youd see for breakdowns  for a character youre auditioning for  i basically make that for each npc  to remind me of what ive done  and if its a particularly weird voice  that i dont know if i could replicate in the future  after the /none/ session ill go and do a little audio file  of me doing the voice so i can go back to it later  travis youre a freak of nature man  taliesin seriously  matt good question  marisha theres a lot that goes into it  i think matt just to put it into perspective  for everyone in the chat room  i think matt probably spends close to eight hours  at least on each time before we play  or i guess at least we used to  matt for our big session  id /none/ spend as much time preparing as we did playing  ill put it that way  i spend as much time preparing as we play  so for these sessions  im spending about three hours a week  preparing what three to four hours a week  for old sessions that was bigger  liam someone asked what was the reaction to discovering  you had a magic flying carpet  which you can see if you go to matts youtube channel  theres a video that ashley made of us playing  and you see our reactions to /none/ that  marisha who was it was it you or vex  that tried to float down with the carpet  and then we realized it was magic  liam yeah underneath  marisha but we tried to just use it like a parachute  matt it was a crumbling tower it was alluras tower  you guys went into realized she was missing  because the tower had been attacked  you set off essentially a defense system  of her arcane tower  which caused it to crumble into a tiny pearl  orion tiberius jumped out the /none/ window  and just cast featherfall  matt yeah and just kinda glided away  you turned into an eagle and grabbed the gnomes  the rest of the party had to try  to rapidly escape a crumbling tower  that was compacting on to itself  marisha i think it was mainly the twins in the tower  liam hey grog almost died once  he fell from a great  matt you fall a lot but when you fall on to something  that thing is fucked  matt all right were winding down here  cause /none/ we gotta leave here shortly guys  two more questions  liam three more questions  zac closing messages before you guys go too  matt oh yeah all right so well do a couple more questions  then well go to closing messages  who wants to pick  liam lets make it a magic three  marisha lets do a good one  matt three three questions make em quick  lets see  marisha waiting for a good one  matt how much does grog weigh  grog weighs approximately 600 pound we decided  travis just /none/ under 700  matt so hes kinda rough  travis its all muscle bitch  matt yeah it is  muscle and brains  travis muscle and wang  500 pounds and a hundredpound wang  matt any of you consider running a game  for fans of the stream  actually ive run a couple games at conventions  for some groups  i had a couple of sessions i ran  actually in conjunction with wizards  they sent stuff out for us  taliesin and for charity  matt yeah weve had some charity dd games out /none/ here in la  so weve done them before  id consider it if there was time available  and a venue that allowed it  so if it does happen  well definitely announce it here  travis best item in your inventory  orion thats for a magic item  travis oh did we already say that  im just blanking  orion no  taliesin its hard to read this quickly  matt you guys have some good questions  travis my brains turning into applesauce  ashley i know me too  liam do you realize /none/ how lucky you all are  to have such a nice group of friends  all yes  matt very much so  taliesin the world is cold and unfeeling  liam lets close it on that  i love these guys  matt and i like to think that this is  because there are so many good people out there in the world  and we were lucky enough to find each other  through weird circumstances  and there are so many good people in the world out there  dont close yourself off to it  /none/ youd be surprised how many awesome  travis how long does it usually take the woman in the back  to tie her boot  marisha im multitasking  matt no thats the question we end it on  thats the question  marisha ive just been
