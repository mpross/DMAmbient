none	 forward to overwatch i havent hit it yet  marisha its so good you guys  matt were going to have to sync up and play it  taliesin its going to be a thing  matt anyway weve got questions to get to so first and foremost we have a few sources of  questions obviously were not going to get to a lot of them tonight because theres a lot of  questions but theres a reddit thread thats been up for a little while were going to be pulling  questions from there the chat room as 
none	 well we have at our side here we have questions coming  from you guys there as long as we can keep track of it because it goes pretty fast is my mic bad  not getting a good mic ill lean this way then and try and get to this section should work fine  marisha you could adjust the boom  matt yeah but the camera is there karen  karen youre very audible theyre just being picky  matt just being picky guys stop being picky its all good so long as you guys can hear me 
none	 i  think were okay yeah we have reddit we have the chat room and then we have on twitter the  hashtag critical role questions as well well be going through those and picking questions  answering them as they come so let us begin were apologizing now for all of us looking at our  phones its not because were bored its because we want to answer your questions  liam thats where the questions are  marisha ermagerd querstions  matt this comes from groghammer on reddit after the episode cows and consequences matt said it  
dung	 was one of the weirdest but not the weirdest dd experience hes ever had to him and others with  experience what is the weirdest thing thats happened in a game youve played this is an  interesting question  marisha offscreen i guess outside of cows and consequences  matt it could be something in critical role if you want to but if you had other stranger  experiences ill begin this was weird but dark this was when i was running the ravenloft game for  a few years with my old group back in the late 2000s 
none	 as they began to make their way through  barovia the atmosphere of it was drawing them down and every night theyd sleep there they  would take corruption similarly to how you did when you were in whitestone under the watch of the  briarwoods we had our bard begin to grow sharpened teeth we had our rogue character who  had a longdormant mummy rot that had been subsiding in his body begin to spread again we  had our blood mage who had died and been resurrected came back not quite right and went a  little 
none	 feral and then we had our paladin whose skin all of a sudden was pulled tighter against  his body and as a person whose whole ideal was to fight undead to look in the mirror one day and  see that he resembled one he went crazy and started smashing stuff it was a cool buildup but  one of the weirder fun experiences was when they had finally finished the battle with strahd when  they had defeated him and in theory saved ravenloft the epilogue ended up being a at what  cost circumstance well the cleric 
none	 died in the final battle the paladin killed himself the  blood mage disappeared into the forest and was never seen again the rogue who was like the  older indiana jones character of the group took the castle for himself and became the new lord of  barovia batmanstyle supposedly to watch over the city but his corruption had gotten so heavy  that it wasnt sure if they were replacing one monster with another and the bard who had had a  constant feud with the rogue got in the final moments of the game in a huge 
none	 argument  postbattle and the rogue grabbed him and tore his tongue out and the bard now served him as  this mute subservient gollum figure and was at the edge of his throne in the epilogue as the  rogue took the throne of barovia for himself  liam its like an edward gorey poem  matt pretty much it was a hell of an end to that campaign  marisha the bard went fullon theon greyjoy style  matt kind of unintentionally that was my friend shaun  taliesin oh yes of course that makes perfect sense  
dung	 matt how about you guys  taliesin i got so enraptured in that story im trying to think  marisha can mine be from mansions of madness can mine be from board games  matt sure this is any game  marisha im partial to the time where i was playing as ashcan pete whos my favorite  character to play as in any cthulhu universe i was down to one hit point had lost my weapon and  was hiding in a chest and i popped out of a chest and punched a shoggoth and killed him  matt 
none	 yeah last hit point it was the hobo jackintheboxing and punching a shoggoth  marisha the old hobo jackinthebox technique and it was great and ill never forget it  taliesin ashcan pete  marisha ashcan who can ashcan  taliesin thank you that was all i hoped for  matt any of you guys  liam my tabletop is high school which i dont remember too well and then our home game the  show was far crazier than our home game was as fun as the home game was nothing as lunatic as  the cow episode  
none	 ashley i wasnt a part of that cow episode but i remember watching it and i was like this is  ludicrous i was laughing so hard i had projectile tears i was like this is the  weirdest thing thats happened in this game  matt it was pretty legitimate hopefully this will work better for audio thank you so much  taliesin we did a sabbat vampire game tabletop years ago at my friend dons house that involved a  savage burn on the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean at disneyland and we were  resurrected 
none	 as vampires inside the haunted mansion and he had built an elaborate map of the  entire ride it was really spectacular  laughter  taliesin its forever colored both of those rides  marisha i want to see is there a barovia travel poster out there someone has to have made  something like that right  matt i hope so like a pamphlet  marisha yeah come visit sunny barovia  matt notquitesunny barovia if you do find that on the internet please send it to us or find  us on twitter id love to see that 
none	 question ashley what classes would the cast of blindspot  be in your opinion from zodaru in the chatroom  ashley probably sully who plays kurt the main guy or no well start with jane doe i think  she would be a fighter straightup fighter class i think kurt weller sully would be a barbarian  i think zapata would be a rogue i would probably be a bard or probably still a cleric  matt yeah you said so on the show  ashley yeah so i am  matt that was my favorite injoke ive ever seen 
none	 in television from a nerd point ever those who  havent seen it theres an episode of blindspot where ashleys character gets teased about playing  your wizard and elf game and you correct them with  ashley its called dungeons and dragons  matt im actually a gnome cleric and i was like yes  ashley put it in where we can just stick it right in  liam its called outreach  laughter  matt it is a way to put it  ashley outreach our outreach campaign  matt liam did you find a question you wanted 
none	 to tackle  liam um  ashley i know theyre coming in fast coming in hot  matt here ill throw one in while you guys are looking question for the players a few of you  have come close to trading blows before this is from storybeforenumbers on the reddit page  within the actual narrative of critical role do you believe your character could ever be capable  of seriously fighting or killing another party member and if so what would it take to reach  that point  liam i think it would take a lot and 
none	 i got a lot of static after vax punched percy a week later  everyones like like vax has any horse to stand on with what happened with his sister first of all  that was what was running through my head as i punched percy none of you had to tell me about  that thats what i was thinking about and if that hadnt happened i probably would have done  more than punch him one time i probably would have went a little bit further but i would say on  one hand vax thinks its a 
none	 little different because vax rushed in to try to save his sister  not exactly the same situation but on the other hand youre kind of right he doesnt have any moral high  ground and im not trying to play anyone on moral high ground and i thought do i have the right to  do this probably not who cares were all playing imperfect people  taliesin percy would absolutely kill another member of vox machina if he thought that it was  for the good of the whole group he thought if there was a situation where 
none	 it was like put one  down because they were a threat to everybody else hed probably be okay probably  marisha yeah keyleth has a hard time killing the scum of the earth so no  taliesin i couldnt kill trinket i think id feel really bad i couldnt live with myself  liam youre going to get dicapriod  laughter bear grunting  ashley i dont know if pike could do it even if they were really bad or something was terrible i  feel like pike would try anything to not kill one of the members  
none	 liam you should stay in that mindset after the break  ashley no i will not tonight is an exception my friend  matt well sarenrae part of her sphere of influence is redemption too with pike i could  see her definitely she feels that even somebodys whos fallen that far from what she  knew she could find a way to bring them back  ashley yeah theres still something in them that should still be there i dont think theres  anything that can make her kill somebody except tonight  matt except tonight there you go 
none	 well have it  taliesin tonights special  matt anyone find any questions they prefer for this one  marisha i have a good one this is from carakiriyama on twitter if the characters  hadnt found each other and formed vox machina what do you think theyd be doing instead  taliesin percyd be dead by now  marisha keyleth might be dead  taliesin he would have walked into something stupid and that would have been the end of it  liam i think the twins would have been doing mercenary work somewhere  marisha keyleth would try 
none	 and continue on her aramente by herself if she had to maybe find  other people to pal around with along the way she tagged along with you guys because she was afraid  that shed die out there alone which once again probably wouldve  ashley i feel like pike wouldve probably stayed hanging out in the bramblewood living with  wilhand i feel like shes pretty smalltown i think this is such a huge adventure for pike and  the only thing that brought pike out of it was because of grog was a family and being like 
town	  well i guess ill leave try to help him and find him i dont think she wouldve explored  that much she wouldve stayed so vox machina brought out the best  marisha and taliesin singing just a small town girl living in a lonely world  laughter  matt that is now your theme song  ashley yes such a good theme song  matt ill answer this quick question mandalorecauldley on twitter asks what has  been the worst or best if funniest way there has been a tpk in any game youve played for those  
none	 of us whove had that happen before it was the paranoia game that we played on here was pretty  fun there was definitely a universal tpk as in we accidentally wiped out all of existence and  reality so that was fun i wasnt actually part of this game but i loved the story behind it  this was an evil campaign that same guy who was the rogue in my ravenloft game shaun and a few  other people were playing this was 30 dd and they were an evil campaign they were all evil  characters this 
none	 was in ravenloft the swords  sorcery setting not the expedition to ravenloft  the whole plane of ravenloft and his evil cleric had set up for half the game a plot to  eventually to kill the rest of the party and take them for power but only the dm knew and  eventually he found the right moment right towards the end of their story arc and they were  on the cusp of finally completing their adventure and he told the dm this is the moment and he  systematically killed each member of the party took 
none	 their heads preserved their heads still  living and put them on the shelf in his nowdark tower and that was the end of the campaign he  ended up tpking the rest of his own party and putting them on the shelf  taliesin bless shaun  matt shauns an interesting character actually i think im seeing him this weekend at momocon in  atlanta see you in a few days shawn  laughter  ashley i feel like it would be so fun to be an evil character  liam i want to do a oneoff sometime that 
none	 goes further than the goblin game  matt that can be arranged next time we have a day off like this and people cant make it  whoevers around well do an evil oneshot  marisha you started salivating almost  laughter  ashley evil voice we should do an evil oneshot  liam i know what that character is for that game  matt that makes me happy chat room lets see  marisha lchow on twitter says who comes up with and assigns the episode titles i think this  is a funny story mainly they come out 
none	 organically  matt yeah i have my own titles when i give the adventure preparation for each session in the  actual documents in my folder but then when the episodes happen that very much informs what the  episode titles are usually its  marisha like at dawn we plan  ashley that was so i was like this has got to be it  marisha we all walk out and go like well thats the title  matt the titles come out the next monday morning taliesin texting or emailing me at 1130 am  taliesin okay we 
none	 need a title now youve got 20 minutes good morning whats up  matt and ill be in the middle of a session like okay bathroom break okay ooh thatll be  good and thats all it is  ashley i actually didnt know that i didnt know that you thought of the titles because theyre fantastic  liam well you got the birdseye view matt  matt thats the thing id feel a little weird if somebody i didnt know did the titles like the  last episode that came out somebody was like the dragon episode id be 
none	 like hmm im not  saying that would be the case whoever would possibly do the titles here at geek  sundry but  im a little attached  ashley it makes sense i dont know who else i thought wouldve done it besides you  matt we can do a vote  taliesin draw lots  marisha we do most everything ourselves  liam i got one people all week all year really but a lot this week have been asking  me and telling me asking me does vax have a death wish or saying that vax has 
none	 a death wish  you are free to think i have a death wish i dont have a death wish i dont want to roll a new  character i love my character but im not going to play him like an accountant im going to rush  in and try to save people and kill the motherfuckers who killed my parents my mother i  dont have a father  matt you do have a father  laughter  liam well get to that i dont have a death wish i do not want to stop playing my character 
none	  he could die next week and ill be bummed for a while but this is how im going to play him  ashley would you cry i would cry  marisha i would cry so much  matt we cried so hard when you died that one time  ashley that was horrible  liam if i survive next weeks game i will do something just as dumbfuck two to five episodes  later so strap in thats what im doing  marisha its not like we have a plan i think people assume we have plans  matt 
none	 well first off no plan survives contact with the enemy this is the general term and  also thats what dd is about there have been many games that ive played where i could do the  smart safe move but then i stop myself and go why to me id rather try something spectacular  and fail spectacularly than keep it safe and on its own and even if a character could possibly  die those are the moments that you remember  ashley its true  taliesin whats the video game from rick and morty im trying to 
none	 remember  matt oh the one where he goes and lives the life  taliesin youre taking him off the grid he doesnt have his social security card  laughter  liam the game can be different things for different people and if people want to treat it like  a wow raid go for it have fun with that but if i had to be like okay how i can max out my  opportunities here and my chance to get my devout thats not why i play i play to stick  myself in epic books that i 
none	 loved reading as a kid and sometimes characters die  taliesin many of those people in those books die  ashley i feel like weve all become the characters so much  liam yeah someone else asked how long did it take to create your characters and i feel like  its still happening the first game was like yeah im a rogue were twins cool okay what  do i do i sneak around grog doesnt even know that he can do whatever the hell he wants great  its so looseygoosey  marisha its such an urban outfitter 
none	 inspirational poster our stories are never over  laughter  liam its still ripening and sometimes we have oneonone conversations with each other or in a  group we feel like were learning new things about the character every game or each other  or ourselves even playing this game  taliesin i feel kneedeep in act two right now yeah hes totally act two  matt you two especially have had some interesting changes you changed from prestream to stream  because of your whole experience on the ship and after death pike has become a lot more hardened 
none	  and accepting of the harshness of reality and thats been cool to watch that happen  ashley its been fun i almost still feel like pike is a little bit of act one even with  everything thats happening im still a little like ooh theres more there  taliesin waiting for that big break to happen  ashley yeah but its getting there someone asked what led to ashley and travis deciding to  link their backstories together that was actually not my decision  liam that was how you hooked her in  ashley that was how 
none	 he put it together which i thought was really cool because i came to the  second game that you guys played  matt yeah it was the second game travis couldnt be there for the second game so i worked  it into the story i didnt give you exactly what it was but i said if you want to tie it into  why travis cant be there with his character how would you want to work these together  ashley which is so crazy because how our friendship ingame has turned out is so huge in  
none	 the game for me which i wonder if that wasnt the story how different that would have been but  thats such a huge part of the story for me so crazy  matt it evolves in a really strange way  liam vax has a wishing he could follow a bit in her footsteps or did and i dont want to get too  much into that and obviously all this i didnt have any beef with you at any time in the past  but now i dont trust you as far as i can throw you  
none	 taliesin good thats a really good decision  liam grog and vax never had any real digging at each other but its a little dicier now theyre  okay but a little bit of  marisha one of these days me and you our ideals are going to come to a crashing head  taliesin oh its going to be a crashing head im curious theres so many things that are on  the cusp of happening  ashley theres a lot of things because i havent even gotten to deal with this motherfuck yet about  whats been going 
none	 on with him  marisha oh yeah yeah  liam im a cutter ive been cutting  matt dagger dagger dagger  ashley him being vax not liam  liam im vex  matt marisha taliesin dont  matt dont fuck with her youre right  liam how long have we been playing this game for  ashley but still the splitsecond where i was like shit i got it wrong no i didnt  matt thats your own fault by the way one letter off you dicks real fast i want to put  this out there because this 
none	 question has come up a lot this week yes im well aware that  dimension door from a rules standpoint says that if you are to teleport to a space occupied by a  creature it would shunt you out and take 4d6 psychic damage i think i agree with that  however the players came up with a very interesting plan formed two of the smallest  possible members into a creature that is so large that i considered in that moment that there would  be enough space where you wouldnt be occupying technically the same space as 
dung	 the creature so i  allowed it for that circumstance most of the time yes they would be shunted out and if youd  rolled a lower intelligence roll you probably would have been pushed out the side but as a  dungeon master you have to justify things consider what makes sense versus what doesnt how  much do the mechanics written in the rules rule your game in the narrative and how much you want  to allow because the players have been creative or its an interesting way that could make sense and  you can justify 
none	 i chose in that moment to justify that and it didnt necessarily work in their  favor in some ways but thats the nature of making weird cool plans and seeing if they come  to fruition or not  liam still a fun game  matt so im well aware and yes i did let it that doesnt mean you have to you can be angry  that i didnt follow the rules i thought it was fun and cool  liam sure you did theres a rule in the rulebook that says bend the rules whenever you want 
none	 to bend  the rules thats a rule so matt followed the rules  ashley this is actually a cool question this is for matt and i would like to know this has there  been something ingame thats happened that has absolutely shocked you where you were like this  is something thats never happened in a game ive dmed  matt teleporting inside a dragon is definitely new the cows and consequences episode in general  was ridiculous there have been a few moments well first off everyone going for the  treasure at the end of a 
none	 boss encounter without healing up or checking for traps and that trap  that i had set up there just as a possible blockade being enough to knock vex out based on the bad  roll ive never had a player death that was directly after the conflict and danger you know  what i mean where the calm everythings cool explosion it was from a narrative standpoint  really cool how it played out but i wasnt expecting that to happen at all it was going to  be one other annoyance and warning of the power behind this 
none	 artifact and it just happened that way  ashley that was the worst  marisha we all felt like such assholes about that we were all like wow that was dumb  liam personally one of my most insane moments because ive always told myself all right the  twins vax is going to give himself up for his sister whenever he does it and in that  splitsecond i was like here it is here we go im going to end my game im ending it lauras  going to go on im out just like i planned and 
none	 you went flipped it on me  matt thats what i do  liam all my ideas for the future went pfft  matt good  liam had to change everything i was thinking  matt no that was pretty cool other moment i would say honestly the showdown with kevdak i  wasnt sure if you guys were going to survive that or at least a few of you were going to fall  a couple of key rolls in that fight the grog escape the broom escape using the necklace in a  way that i never considered 
none	 it to be used that was the way you guys planned that battle worked  out almost perfectly to just barely save your asses because that fight was one of the harder  encounters id ever developed and it was more like i wasnt sure how it was going to go down i  had three other maps on the side in case you guys had a sewer journey if you guys wanted to stealth  in during the night and assassinate kevdak in his room attempt or find a way to try and  marisha that wouldve been a 
none	 good idea  taliesin wow fuck why didnt we think of that  matt there were different ways this could have worked the way this all went down i left it open  to see what you guys were going to do and this was possibly the hardest way to handle it but it  also ended up being one of the most dynamic and cinematic so i was excited how it worked out  liam it was such a backandforth too because we were like okay heres what were going to try  to do shit its working its 
none	 working we got this we got this and then it went explosion  and flipped into 180 and were like were dead were dead and then a hail mary pass at the last  second ripping expectations back and forth  matt if anybody had got the death blow aside from grog they wouldnt have stopped that was the sad  and scary part because its one thing having an old member of the herd that challenged him dealing  the death blow to give them pause and really consider has this power move shifted is he the  new 
none	 leader that was enough to cause everyone to stop and really consider the situation and with  zanror being brought forth and released it put them into this tense period of not subservience  or respecting or accepting the new rule but not really knowing what to do because their leader was  gone and the one who challenged and killed him in a spectacular death and it gave them pause if it  was a shitty halfelf that ran up and stabbed their ruler  marisha hey  matt from their perspective you guys were shitty halfelves all right 
none	 and a shitty gnome and a  shitty human  ashley hey rude  matt it wouldve continued in their mind to be an aggressive act and they wouldve continued to  steamroll you that was so crazy anyway yeah we should answer another question  marisha similar kinds of things happened with the dragon though where it was like this is going  well this is going pretty well oh shit  ashley its going not well at all this is very not good  marisha once again internet i think everyones like well pretty much everything that  
none	 couldve went wrong did that pretty much  taliesin thats so not true so many things that couldve gone wrong didnt  marisha we did pretty well considering  liam im a ground fighter if id been on the ground id probably be goo in shoes  matt if you guys had not managed to the whole mechanic id used was if the trap succeeded based  on the dragons perception roll and how well you guys hid things had the dragon even noticed  there was something different and wrong it wouldnt have landed it wouldve stayed up there 
none	  and started spraying you guys down maybe throwing spells it wouldve been bad  ashley we did pretty well considering  matt considering and you holding it to the ground was important because it prevented it  because its breath weapon is a line it limited its range and what any powerful dragon does to its  advantage is stays in the air and uses those few rounds were key once it did get free you saw how  fast it could turn in a negative position for a group and the chains were good it sacrificed  damage 
none	 but it also raised the dc of its ability to escape from the grapple that was holding it on  the ground you guys did a really good job and had some rolls going in your favor but  once it started turning over and it escaped it went south very quick  marisha but we have him on the run  matt you have him on the run kind of  ashley that was the worst cliffhanger of a game  matt i know it wasnt my intent i had to sleep  ashley i know i know  
none	 marisha someone asked a question when are you getting shirts on geek and sundry that says your  fun is wrong  matt laughs i dont know thats a polarizing term in the community im glad and im excited  that people are passionate enough to be so invested that they are frustrated that things they  came up with didnt happen or that they saw circumstances that outside of the game could have  worked to me i think those discussions are great there are some people that take it too far  and actually make verbal attacks on 
dung	 the players via social media or go out of their way to use  those circumstances to really be unfairly dark and necessarily down on us and im like those are  shitty and those are more of what thats referring to but overall i love the discussion  and i think its great everyone will handle a situation differently and i love people who will  have those talks so i dont know if the yourfuniswrong is in a good enough spirit to put  on a shirt i do eventually want to do a you can certainly try 
none	 shirt  marisha i think you can certainly try is next  taliesin yeah thats the darkest thing that we ever hear in the game you can certainly try  matt laughs i love it so much  taliesin ill roll my die to spite you  matt all right lets find another question here lets see  marisha someone asked if keyleth was a vegetarian again no shes not shes a druid  she just acts like it  laughter  matt from geekspiral on reddit for ashley do the blindspot writers work out the critical role  references 
none	 with you or do they sneak it in themselves  ashley they asked when i brought the mug to set because i asked them i was like i want to  have one mug that my character uses and they were like okay pick out a mug and i was like  oh i already have one and i brought the critical role mug and they were like oh cool what is  this and i was like just the coolest thing ever dont worry about it this is what im  using but then i couldnt do it for 
none	 so many episodes because it had to be cleared by nbc and  theyre like well what is this critical role and im like well so i had to go through and  theyre like can we use it i was like of course yeah and i was like well its a  dungeons  dragons game i play with my friends  marisha well its online grandma its online no no its not like on tv  taliesin its not the email  ashley and then with the writers i think they started hearing about it some of them 
none	 have  started watching it which is so funny and then they started adding little stuff here and there  about that my character plays dungeons  dragons and then the last one with the gnome cleric i  didnt tell them that i just read the script yeah and then when i read the script the person  who had written that episode he came over and he was like yeah because i watched it and i know  youre a gnome cleric and i was like this is the best day ever  laughter  ashley it was 
town	 like my favorite day at work my favorite episode yeah my favorite scene that i  shot so i was like that made my day made my day  liam i get asked frequently if im ever going to dm a oneshot for our show like when youre out  of town theoretically like a year from now or more if you wanted to go to aruba or burning man  or whatever maybe in a year or so but im playing with kids the kids have low expectations  or no expectations i dont remember any of the rules 
none	 seeing all of the quivering palm business  and dragon fight business im not ready for that talk to me in a year but i do it at home its  great my kids love it  taliesin you guys are intimidating out there legitimately  matt its one thing to play a game its another to play it on the internet where a lot of people  can tell you immediately what you did wrong but were still having fun  liam so far  ashley i like this one somebody asked what do you think is your characters 
none	 biggest fault  taliesin oh i saw that rolling through its a good one  matt what do you think is your biggest fault guys  marisha i feel like some of them are apparent right  matt that you can say  marisha our biggest fault i guess her tragic flaw extreme selfloathing and guilt fairly  transparent on that one there i think yeah keyleth pretty much hates everything she does and  feels worthless yeah  matt there you go laughs to bring it up on you guys  taliesin id say an interesting mix for percy 
none	 of selfloathing which is definitely a big thing for  him too and the unbridled belief that his parents put into him that hes the only adult in the room  someone also said is it fair to call percy the doctor doom of his world no he is definitely  the reed richards of his world and if you read fantastic four you will know that reed richards  is a terrible person hes a terrible terrible person  matt like that you vax  liam well i think that vax has a little bit of selfloathing too i 
none	 dont know people think  that vax thinks hes a boy scout i dont and i dont think he does either for the backstory i  was a thief for years i did shitty things and stole from people so he could get by i think he  at this point in life feels like hes been a fuckup and a waste of time most of his life and  the only good thing hes had in his whole life is his relationship with his sister which is like  one good true thing but everything else theyre deadenders  
none	 ashley no hes not  liam well maybe maybe things are changing but thats what he was and then also he follows his  heart now to a fault  matt right and you pike  ashley gosh pike is perfect just no faults whatsoever no gosh i think that with the death  that was before the stream i think she felt like she was not as helpful in the group and i think  that sticks with her with trying to be like i need to earn my place yeah i dont know shes  got some weird 
none	 stuff with her family which we havent really gotten into because she comes from  the deep gnomes theyre a little bit of tricksters hence the last name trickfoot it  probably would be the equivalent of coming from i dont want to say that because it sounds so  judgmental never mind  marisha were all degenerates were all fuckups  liam and thats what we love about them none of us are trying to be white as snow even those of  us who think they mean the most good for the world were all fuckups were going 
none	 to continue  to fuck up  matt yeah im going to do a couple quick twitter questions here rapidfire so we can get through  some of these taliesin did matt tell you about the demon in the gun or when did he  taliesin no he didnt tell i found out when you did yay  matt laughs he knew orthax or he knew that some sort of smoke entity had attached to him and  made an offer but you didnt know what bound it to you and it was the weapon yeah  taliesin nothing at 
none	 all i didnt even know i left it open to have just been nothing it could  have just been that he had a dream one night and went nuts it literally could have been nothing  liam you clever bastard  matt its fun the fact that sam caught up on that and got rid of it was one of my favorite  character moments for him because that was going to stick around  taliesin i want my gun back  ashley no you dont you do not need it  matt build a new one  taliesin 
none	 i havent had time everything keeps exploding  matt i know laughs it keeps exploding  taliesin if something could stop blowing up for five minutes ill finish four projects around the  house waffle iron  ashley theres so many questions ooh  matt yeah theres a lot of questions any you want to pick up on  ashley no ive already asked a lot  liam laura says by text is the chat not working  matt chats working  taliesin maybe their video is broken  liam chats working la  ashley hi laura hi twavis  
none	 liam hi are you guys on the other side of the planet now  matt someone asks did sam get experience for destroying the gun yes he did moments like  that key moments big story moments like that those are the marks i make those are like the  bumpexperience bonuses he got a few hash marks for figuring that out and finding a way to make  it happen without you murdering him in the process  laughter  taliesin yeah that was very impressive  marisha heres a question that i actually get a lot this was 
none	 from tiamatzx on twitter why was  keyleth hostile towards kima in the past in the very beginning  liam shifty eyes  marisha yeah you cant trust her shifty eyes no a lot of its starting to slowly be revealed  now actually i feel like but keyleth doesnt trust really any type of religious establishment  its not necessarily where she comes from and i think shes had a few bad experiences enough in  the past to where shes seen the corruption of a church and at the time kima was fullheartedly  running into a blaze 
none	 of glory and death and we were sent there to go grab her with really no  other lead on who she actually was or what she actually wanted i didnt trust that  taliesin shes not exactly miss charming either is she  marisha right and i think we happened to have two personality types like keyleth and kima had  two personality types that butted heads  matt yeah its true question here real fast matthewmercer do you discuss the nights events  in the car ride home or days later together with marisha i guess is what 
none	 theyre referring to  yeah on the ride home well definitely be like that was crazy and well recall events that  happened and shell mention things or ask questions and ill say i dont know and  shell get angry at me  marisha thats mainly most of it  matt yeah its also about why chat is so toxic like guys calm down its okay its a game  calm down about keyleth guys shes having a fun time  liam were not deciding laws in the supreme court were being doofuses  marisha im the awkward unlikeable 
none	 one i get it  matt well the interesting point was we were talking about that it was like why is there  this polarizing anger about keyleth out there and i think a lot of it may come from the fact  that you are your character by nature is an awkward character who isnt the heroic  grandstanding hero isnt the trickster han solo rogue and as that personality type against a  banner of other characters who fit more in those realms  taliesin lets stick a miyazaki princess in the middle of the show and see 
none	 what happens thatll  be great  matt essentially  liam 16 years old jaded  laughter  liam tatted up the sleeves and princess mononoke dropped in the middle  matt yeah its an interesting psychology experiment to think about that from my  standpoint i think keyleths a great character completely unbiased from a dms standpoint  taliesin i like everybody im horrified by the thought of losing any of us  matt im horrified and excited  taliesin i know  matt i know that sounds awful but from a narrative standpoint im never going to force 
none	  it by any means so if people are like matt killed someone im like im not going to kill  anybody on purpose im going to let circumstances work out so far there have been a couple close  calls one of these days one of those dice is going to roll lower than that resurrection dc  liam close calls are getting closer and closer together matt  matt i know hey stakes are escalating guys  liam could you give us a list of the easiest encounters to the hardest or could you put a  skull 
none	 next to the superhard ones like in fallout where youre not supposed to go near the bad guy  because the skull is floating there  matt theres an ancient dragon  liam i didnt want to fight it  taliesin i thought we werent and then suddenly oh this is happening now  liam we need to go get some of these things and come back  marisha about fighting the dragon  liam yeah i said it like 20 times  matt hey man depending on how this works out some lessons will be learned and hopefully  
none	 prepare you for the next encounter a little better depending on whos left  ashley i dont like the sound of that how this turns out i know maybe we let him after we  get you out run  marisha theyre going to be so angry at us those dragons  ashley it would be really interesting with this group though if someone did have to reroll a  character since we all do already know each other so well that would be a very interesting dynamic  marisha i feel like itd be like transferring high schools and 
none	 youre the new kid in class  walking in for the first time and youre like hey  liam also the whole cast is this were all very ripened mature characters with lots of  nuance and the first one will be like hey im a new bard where are my spells  marisha ive had that legitimate fear because when we came into this we were already two years  into our characters and i was like jeez it took us a while to find them and make them as deep and  complex as they are  liam 
none	 although when you play every week we used to play every six weeks so things were a little  shallower at home and now  matt yeah its going to be interesting  ashley lets make it not happen  matt yeah just make sure you pay attention to the lore and the previous experiences youve had  with dangerous entities  liam there is a lot of lore matt  marisha i feel like hes feeding us hints  ashley i know  taliesin for the first time ever i feel like matt is actually  matt ive told 
none	 you nothing i just like messing with you guys  liam somebody asked how you and i avoid awkwardness in real life after vax and keyleth moments  taliesin you guys are really awkward its weird  marisha who are you the chat room  liam were pretty cool with it its like an acting gig really  marisha yeah were mature adults i think  ashley were probably all more awkward with it were all like how do you feel  marisha okay i will say that liam and i walked away we were like wait no one flinched 
none	 at a  scanlan and pike scene no one flinched  liam not at all everyone crawled inside their own assholes when we had our  ashley i think because you guys had the maiden voyage  liam thats right we were pioneers  ashley you were the pioneers and we all learned from that moment of oh you can have moments like  these and everybody has to not be 12 about it  liam it was like that moment when you first get to prison and they put you on the wall and take  the hose and 
none	 bring it  marisha hey stings  liam hey do you maybe want to go out sometime i kind of like you ow  ashley i know we were the worst we were the worst  matt im going to pull up another reddit question here  liam laura andor travis  marisha theyre not here  liam ill answer for travis  marisha ill answer for laura  matt there you go you guys should do that  liam grog voice what what  marisha wink wink wink  matt lets see ashley do you prefer as a player 
none	 to watch things unfold or do you want to  be in the drivers seat more also would you ever convert anyone to worshipping sarenrae from  jojorious on reddit  ashley i think for me personally i still feel a little like a newbie in a way because theyve  played so many games consistently week after week and because of work i still feel a little  rusty so for me theres a part of me not as pike that likes to watch things unfold first  before making a move because im like can i do this 
none	 im a little unsure sometimes  liam thats pike or thats ashley youre saying  ashley thats ashley but i think i feel like pike is the same way but i feel like these things  blur together but i think with pike its almost better to hang back because of being a cleric  because you can do a little cleanup after just whos hurt who can we protect and keep alive and  keep in the battle there was another part to the question  matt oh would you ever convert anyone to worshipping sarenrae  ashley oh 
none	 yes probably not i feel like with pike theres a lot of which weve had so many  times talks in the game and out of game about how pike sometimes veers away from worshipping  sarenrae and wants to do bad things i just want to do bad things with my friends hoodrat things  with my friends sometimes she cant there are consequences  liam you make sarenrae look really good on the outside  ashley well all right i dont think pike would ever be like you need to convert to sarenrae because  youre a bad 
town	 person so no  marisha you will never be those protesters outside of comiccon  ashley no never ever ever  liam oh man can we do a photoshoot with ashley with the sign for sarenrae  laughter  matt standing out on a street corner at comiccon  ashley done were doing it  matt question real fast from atlasadams on reddit saying do the vestiges still draw their  power from the deities if so wouldnt they not work for a person who is disloyal im not going  to go too deep into that i will say 
none	 that not everyone who was part of the battle and the whole  divergence itself was a religious individual many of the artifacts did stem from religious power  some of them also from arcane secrets not everything is tied to a specific deity per se  also theres two sides to every battle not going to say any more than that  marisha someone said i think its supposed to be alkie on twitter how did mary elizabeth and  other guests come about are you friends with them and they just wanted to join  matt my apologies 
none	 i was looking for another question thinking that was to you my apologies well  marisha are they friends and wanted to join  taliesin not really just kidding  matt mary had never played before and had not really exhibited interest when we first she was  invited to the very first session that we were going to run but she couldnt make it she was  like i dont know but then hearing all the stories over the years of us playing privately  she was like oh this sounds like fun im like yeah i already have 
none	 too many players sorry  liam knew shed be good at it though  matt i know shed never played an rpg before when we had the opportunity to bring guests on the  show it was like oh we have to see if mary can make it and will who id worked with on  thundercats and a few other projects between hes a huge fantasy buff as youve seen in the  previous qa he loves fantasy but hed never played an rpg before we had conversations about  dd back when we began our campaign and he 
none	 kept asking about it and i could see that twinkle in  his eye of interest and i was like well we have a guest spot coming up would you be  interested in playing he was like i have no idea what im doing sure and so we got together  at the coral cafe and we built a character went over the rules a bit and hes like i still  dont know what im doing but sure and he did great and the dynamics been fantastic and im  glad they had an opportunity to actually play 
none	 together when they came back for a couple  episodes that was cool  liam back in seven seconds  marisha i love that in classic windows fashion the tablet decided to update and restart in the  middle of all this so we dont have access to the chat anymore  matt good job windows surface windows surface kicks ass well get back to you chatroom here in a minute  taliesin twitter asks when making sketches for inventions does matt ever shut you down or you  can certainly try you and no usually if it comes to 
none	 the sketch point its the i dont  understand what you want to do please explain to me what you want to do and im pretty good i  try really hard not to push the technology of anything percy makes past 1901 1880 im not  looking to bring the vietnam era to dd  laughter  taliesin machine guns are fancy and wonderful but im shooting musket balls so i dont even  have bullet technology yet and even with the lightning glove i sent sketches of something that  would sort of pretty much work i dont 
none	  know what would have happened if you hit it with lightning but it was definitely a rudimentary  electrical generation system that would have fit in a glove  matt yeah theres for percy this consideration of what your ideas are versus what number one  would be functional in the world two how far these designs could you actually produce based on  your experience in the engineering realm even things that were available in a historical sense  in certain time periods those were people that spent their entire life steeped in these feats of  engineering 
none	 whenever you bring me an idea it would be like trying to marry what youre trying  to accomplish versus what would be viable within the game and finding balance as it is but an  aspect of your class features  taliesin i have no interest in breaking the world any further than where his story is literally that  he broke the world which im sure will come up again at some point  matt what are you talking about i cant imagine itll ever come up  taliesin no thats fine its all over  marisha nerdyequestrian 
none	 on twitter is there something growing between vex and percy  liam actually hold that thought because i have a question thats not the same question its not  for me but its related to that and that is who is pike in love with and i dont want an  answer instead id ask the audience people who are asking questions like that or whats in the  letter dont you think thats like asking while youre reading the first harry potter book why  harry wasnt killed by his nemesis its a book do you really want to 
none	 know the last chapter when  youre in the first chapter  ashley because we could tell you  liam wouldnt you rather the story unfold in front of your eyes  marisha theres a lot of whoareyouguysjonesingfor questions about the  two of you  taliesin i dont talk about who im jonesing for in general percy does not talk about these things  liam taliesin or percy  taliesin oh taliesin does taliesin will never shut up about it  laughter  taliesin i am terrible as everybody knows i am terrible at that  matt thats pretty 
none	 great  taliesin yeah percy has no interest in  liam whats in that letter i would much rather as an audience member who gets to sit on the set  while we play the game see that come out in the story and have my mind blown rather than on  twitter be like oh well its this and this and this and this just enjoy the roller coaster  marisha i desperately want to know whats in the letter  ashley the letter  matt i want to know really bad  liam i want to know at 
none	 the right time  ashley that letter was so lovely that in the game there was about five minutes where i wanted  to cry sam wrote this letter  liam its 30 shit jokes isnt it  matt its just dickbutts for four pages so many dickbutts  ashley but it was so beautifully written he knew nobody would see it except for me maybe unless i  were to just post it and be a jerk about it  liam i took a photo of it but i deleted it i could have read it but i didnt 
none	  ashley i know you did you could have read it but it was paragraphs and paragraphs that were so  beautifully written and that was a moment in the game for me where i was like does pike have  whoa there could be a little something scanlan just because it was so beautiful it  made me pause life is so complicated yes he might have cyrano de bergeraced me who knows  that sounds a little weird  liam you just got cubed  matt lucas real fast we lost the chat room over here on the 
none	 tablet if you could get that going  marisha windows decided to update its not your fault  matt it was like oh hey guys updating because windows  lucas it does that  matt as a hardcore pc user you get used to it ive been using windows 7 for so long and every  two days its like you want windows 10 you sure you dont want windows 10 heres windows 10  ashley im just going to give it to you  matt all youve got to do is press this button youve just got to press 
none	 this red button right  here you cant really click anywhere else but the button all the buttons install windows 10  thanks guys and i finally was like okay ill install ill try this out five minutes later  back to windows 7 ill eventually get there im sure cool thank you buddy matt did you plant  zahras flying cloak and vexs flying broom no the flying cloak she purchased with funds that her  character had accrued up until that point based on what was established after the dragon fight  the first battle she did between 
none	 the cloak and the dragonslaying arrow are the two things she  used all of her funds on that was purely on her end  windows startup noise  matt oh thank you youre working updates are installed as far as the broom that was purely  chosen by hardwick when we made his character with his funds that he was given he was able to  choose to spend it on items he wanted he was like oh flying broom that looks cool ill  take that and i was like all right i know whos going to want 
none	 that i immediately knew as  soon as it happened if he pulls that out whos going to gun for it and as soon as he did vexs  eyes went  ashley gimme  matt i wasnt expecting that to happen i think hardwicks still jokingly bent out of shape about  it ive seen him a few times we went to renn faire the week before last and he was like i  got to get my broom back man and im like yeah have fun with that good luck  taliesin hed have to come back on 
none	 the show at the very least  matt i know well see  liam work on your sleightofhand technique  matt exactly arcane casters can be tricksy im just glad he was able to guest his schedule is so  crazy that was a lot of fun yeah that broom was fully on him he brought it and he lost it  liam ill answer another quick vaxleth question which is what inspired it i think that all  during the home game and even at the beginning of the game on the show vax had the same opinion of 
none	  keyleth as his sister which was come on are you serious most of the time goody twoshoes  really i dont remember what it was i promise i dont remember what it was but something happened  in one game i remember thinking about it after the show and then talking to matt in the next day  or two going like can you do this in dungeons  dragons like would this be okay would you be  okay with it im not going to go anywhere with it but would that be okay thats where it came 
none	  from and the reason i thought it would be fun for the game is the same reason i think why taliesin  had percy give grog an evil sentient sword because it would make the game interesting it  would totally shift the game pieces on the board and add new dynamics in unpredictable ways im  not treating it like a dating sim where the end result for me playing dd was winning the  princess its just to see how things could change in the next year of gameplay  taliesin absolutely there are decisions that you 
none	 make that are specifically like i dont want my  character to learn that much that quickly i dont want him to be that smart and that well ive  learned a valuable lesson about how to treat people and how to nope here yours cool  liam its been done this way for a year lets see what happens if we move this over here and  that over there  marisha a lot of people think im leading vax on  liam ah whatever im having fun  taliesin its fun ill say both taliesin and percy are 
none	 really amused by the entire situation  marisha thats good  ashley same so is ashleypike  matt question from aaronshot on reddit saying matt give us a little tease when you talked  about illegal substances being on the market in emon during one of the qas at a con last year  how much worldbuilding have you done to date that we have not seen yet wildemount marquet as  much as i can its a progressive thing im developing and have been for years free time has  not been copious this show is a fantastic thing 
none	 every week that takes up a lot of my free time we  have a lot of cool things we have coming up that we want to hopefully announce that take a lot of  my free time this is one thing that im always working on i have fleshed out a good portion of  marquet ive fleshed out elements of wildemount its not as fleshed out as others othanzia and  taldorei are the two most fleshed out in my world because those are the two where you guys  have spent your most time whenever this games 
none	 done we start a new campaign itll probably  still be in exandria but it might start in marquet it might start somewhere else in the  world and have a whole different cultural flavor and flair and itll be a whole different side to  this world and therell be references to and history that exists that you would know because  you were part of it before but youll be a whole new group of adventurers in a whole different part  of the world thatll be fun  liam i would say part of the reason that 
none	 i didnt want to fight umbrasyl most of it was because i  didnt think we were ready but part of it is because im looking at this game like a game of  fallout i want to go to the corners of the map i want to go to marquet i want to go to the bottom  of the ocean i want to go to all of these places where the vestiges are  marisha i want to go off the map  liam are we really mainlining the quest really thats what were doing what about all 
none	 these side  things that matts got i want to be a completionist  marisha theres so much to do  matt you play it carefully you still can whatever that means  nervous chatter and laughter  matt oh its so much fun to mess with them  ashley people have asked this before but i actually like this question if you could play  another character ingame who would you pick  liam one of the other characters  ashley one of the other characters  marisha grog no holds barred like zero fucks kill shit its great 
none	 hes like the polar  opposite of keyleth  matt yeah  marisha it would be such a nice palate cleanser it would be so nice to be able to be reckless  and not care break peoples necks whenever i want to must be nice being grog  liam i would go keyleth because i want access to the broad range of magic and ive been so  nonmagic the entire time i dont know shit about magic i barely know anything yeah vax and  side note before we go into this game vax is totally impressed with 
none	 keyleth and thinks that  shes the most powerful one in the group and is in awe of it and feels like a weak dingus  basically in comparison to everybody to everybody  ashley but you do so much damage  liam thats fine not liam vax looks at everybody and is like oh my god look at you  shining beacon of hope look at this crazy fucking motherfucker who can build stuff out of a tin can  look at scanlan staring into the maw of horror and stupidly thinking everythings okay look at  my sister 
none	 whos not scared of anything  marisha and look at how much we all hate ourselves  matt oh thats pretty great  matt vax is sokka someone said in the chat room vax is sokka from avatar  marisha oh weve got to find sokka a master got to find you your own sword  liam ive seen the first three seasons of korra but not the early one  matt watch it with your kids theyll love it seriously its great  liam okay ill get there  matt laughs it says gilmore started out as kind of 
none	 a caricature and was a fleshedout  character question went away but gilmore didnt start out as a caricature in my head i  never want to make an npc a caricature per se there are characters that have strong personality  traits and they emerge themselves because for an npc you have to make an impact quickly you dont  have a lot of time with them and you want to try and make the world lively and interesting for your  players so i have certain personality points that are at the forefront of each personality gilmore  
none	 to me was never a caricature partially because i built him around somebody i used to do theater  with when i was younger in high school so i already had a personality print for him but also  i really wanted to show a character that could be ostentatious and flamboyant in a way that was fun  and not a caricature if that didnt come across my apologies gilmore is a very charismatic very  outgoing salesman and thats part of his job he uses that to his advantage  marisha hes also very deep i dont think 
none	 any of us have looked at him as a onedimensional character  matt but people have their interpretations i care very much about the character  liam first appearance we were rolling laughing we didnt know what was coming there was so much panache  matt thats his whole thing hes a showman and thats so much of his personality and as you guys  got to know him better especially you he let you peek behind the veil a bit and see  ashley yeah you peeked behind the veil  matt the worldwearied individual theres a lot of 
none	 depth to the character  taliesin i love your scarlet pimpernel  matt very much so percival from scarlet pimpernelish  marisha also someone was asking if he was based off of a real person  matt yes he was he was based off a person in high school that i did theater with im not going  to say who because hes on facebook  laughter  liam hes also been one of the greatest pleasures for me for this game because it wasnt anything  that i saw coming it was really funny and surprising the first time 
none	 at home and then he  came back several times and right from the first time that gilmore appeared he zeroed in on vax  and was sweet on vax it was nervous laughter the first time and then slowly over time it got more  charming and more charming up to the point where you guys have seen that probably vax is  legitimately taken with him definitely intrigued by him  ashley he charmed your pants off  liam charmed my almost charmed my pants off just before and then some people are like it  should be 
none	 vax and gilmore like i get it gilmores a great character and vax was  definitely taken with him we probably saw gilmore two to three weeks of the last three years maybe  more ive traveled vax and keyleth though have been traveling together for years so i mean  ashley its a deeprooted love  marisha and we were friends first which is how they always say you should do it  laughter  matt i will say on that fact too because someone asked this question and they said there  have been hints on the characters 
none	 that have exhibited lgbt relationships in the game but a  lot of characters seem to be husbandandwifetype personalities are those only a small number of  people and im like no i dont make a big deal of sexuality in the game unless it comes up  because i dont think its something that should drive the story it just exists in the world i  think theres relationships of all kinds in exandria and i think culturally just like in the  real world some places its more appropriate than not based on wherever they live it doesnt 
none	 mean  i agree with that by any means i believe love is love no matter where you find it and there are  places in exandria where it is more acceptable than others and thats a whole different story  element that might come up depending on where you travel in the world i dont know  liam hey guys were in hollywood were all leftie communists were good  ashley were all commies  matt but yeah like many writers i err on the side of creating an interesting character who  might happen to be gay or 
none	 an interesting character that may happen to be bisexual i try  not to make that a defining characteristic of the personality nor do i want to try and go out of my  way to have a oneoff npc that you encounter be like oh by the way i have a wife and im a  girl because that to me seems like its forced its shoehorned and now its not about the story  its about that relationship whereas if the relationship were to come about as part of the  story then thats just how it is 
none	 because thats life  liam my primary character trait is heterosexuality and i mean as liam  matt laughs how high did you roll on your heterosexual roll when we started your character  liam four  matt good on you hey guys this isnt fatal were not rolling for vaginal circumference  sounds of disgust  matt yeah theres an rpg that does that its the most misogynist awful rpg its a great  example of how not to develop and design a game if you havent seen it or dont see it itll just  make you angry 
none	 dont look up fatal  taliesin no theres places you just dont go on the internet  matt all right anyway we got time for a few more questions before we take a break and go into  the battle royale for those guys who didnt have your questions answered tonight i apologize  weve gotten a lot of questions ill try and go on the reddit occasionally to answer questions  through this thread in the coming months or so off and on and feel free to throw them back at us  on twitter afterward well answer them 
none	 as we can  marisha someone was asking for you to explain where the college of the maestro came from  matt oh college of the maestro yeah i put up a college of the maestro bard college on dms guild  recently and that came from a character i may have mentioned it in previous qas ive never  played a bard but ive always wanted to i love bard classes i love the aspect behind them they  were really underappreciated in previous editions but i loved the idea of a guy who knows a little  bit 
none	 about everything and is an inspiration to the party around him and so i had this character  concept for a long time to make a bard probably a dwarven bard because i love dwarves also who  as opposed to playing music or singing music could pluck the sound from the air around them  the sound of battle the impact of a sword against a shield or the sound of a creature chittering as  it attacks and mold it into a symphony almost like a soundbender where they pull and turn it  into music and that 
none	 was their basis so instead of fighting with a weapon they have a wand and an  open hand and they stand in the middle or the back of the battlefield and conduct it like an  orchestra conductor  ashley thats rad  matt eventually i got really frustrated and was like im going to make this as a bard college  and well see if people like it its gotten a good response its still being tweaked anything  homebrew you try and balance it as best you can at first blast i dont have a lot of 
none	 time to really  finetune it and i wanted to get it out there to get the community response and its been really  great you guys have had great feedback and im tweaking things as we go so therell probably be  a couple more updates in the next few weeks or months so thank you all people who have reached  out and given comments on dms guild or on the reddit thread its making its way towards  hopefully being a fun option for those who want to try it out if you dont like it you 
none	 dont have  to play it  taliesin in my mind im imagining fronk our local noise dj i take the sounds the sounds i  put them together and they make noises  matt oh my god please somebody make a college of the maestro bard that is a deep noise dj  laughter  matt i now use my bardic inspiration die to drop the beat dubstep bard please please  marisha chaoticnachos on twitter asks what shirt are you wearing liam  liam oh this is a loot crate shirt its from one of the last couple 
none	 of boxes you can still get  it its alieninvolved  ashley this has been one of my favorite shirts that theyve put out  marisha this is the xfiles shirt this is when xfiles came back  ashley its so good  liam im going to answer a super quick one and then pass one on to matt that i want to hear the  answer to why did the twins know abyssal we learned it in elf school like latin and then  tukroll asks the vegetables of the virgins is such a cool story arc will you 
none	 release the quest  line after this  matt vegetables of the virgins  liam yes  laughter  ashley what  liam vestiges of divergence  matt the vegetable of the virgins thats a dvd set you dont let anyone know you own  ashley i completely misunderstood the vegetables of the virgins  matt weve all made that mistake right  liam tuk means the vestiges of divergence are you going to drop that on the earth  matt possibly a lot of this content right now im developing as we go and i cant really release  
none	 too much when were still playing through it  liam you know really i just wanted to read that tweet out  matt you did good  ashley you did great  marisha how did i miss that is that like a thing thats been happening because i missed that  matt im hoping in the future to release elements of exandria or elements of the campaign on dms  guild or other means to have you guys play more in what weve done if it interests you or to  take and alter as you like but time has 
none	 to fight itself to me first  liam send you that pocket universe to get inside of  ashley people do keep asking who pike is in love with and same as what liam said well see it  might not ever happen in game maybe it wont but shes in love with somebody its something that  happened prior to playing the show it was a moment that happened and feelings were formed it  might not even be somebody in the group it could even be an npc character  liam trinket totally trinket its trinket thats the 
none	 forbidden love  ashley its trinket its trinket god you guys figured it out  marisha cmdrdara on twitter says how do i get my fellow party members to not be murderhobos  liam good luck  matt my suggestion is consider if your character is a murderhobo there are ramifications  for that type of action in a society you as a dm its your responsibility to keep in mind there  probably unless theyre in some sort of destitute place where thats totally fine there  are going to be guards there are going to be sentinels there 
none	 are going to be people that their  job is to stop murderhobos from coming in and being murderhobos so they will become wanted  they will become hunted theres a possibility there might be a bounty put on their heads from  individuals that are more powerful than the party and if theyre going to be real dicks about it and  not try and play the story youve created and want to murder everyone theyre probably going to  end up shot to death in an alley with a bunch of crossbow bolts and thats the end of 
none	 their game  thats a valuable lesson to learn if its a world which enables a murderhobotype circumstance  thats different and you can find narratives in there but its definitely more of an evil  campaign and a little harder to run unless you have some experience as a gm but if its  something you dont want to happen in the game keep in mind there are ramifications for  such horrible murderous actions which could lead to a really interesting story perhaps they killed  a few people and they all of a sudden meet the families 
none	 of these individuals or the person that  captures them is related to someone they murdered and decides no im not going to execute you im  going to make you work for me until you realize what youve done or perhaps a paladin or a cleric  that actually feels sorry for them is like you did a horrible thing but i dont understand why  you did this i want to understand it until then youre under my watch now theyre working for  this individual who is trying to understand how you were so corrupted as people 
none	 you can find  different ways to turn that behavior into part of the story but if its just the players trolling  you maybe have a talk with your party to work with you and respect the time youve put into the game  marisha and what happens if your fellow party members are murderhobos and youre not  matt then stand up stand up in the story and pull a keyleth and be like guys this is wrong  ashley pullakeyleth  matt and if they turn around and stab your character to death perhaps this isnt the 
none	 gaming  group you should be hanging with  liam maybe your dm could create an allpowerful hobo lich who could murder them  ashley pullakeyleth except if its children  laughter  taliesin just like in real life though you really have to pick your friends weve had games  where not everyones playing the same game and it becomes a problem ive been in that game several  times in my life where theres three different games happening find everybody who wants to play  the game you want to play  matt yeah and as a gm 
none	 or dm before you even start the game have a conversation with all your  players to discuss the kind of game youre all looking for be like hey guys this is the kind  of game i want to run and its got some story some intrigue political elements and some combat  balanced in some players may be like oh i just want to come in kick down doors kill shit  and take loot you want to make sure you all are agreed upon the type of game you want to play so  you dont end 
none	 up four games in before everyone hates each other i will also  taliesin ive got one here  matt go for it  taliesin this one kind of amused me stefan pennington said you said what your characters  greatest flaws were what do you think your characters greatest virtues are which i  thought was funny weve never talk about whats good about our characters very often because  whats wrong with us is so much more interesting  marisha that is true  taliesin i know this is an interesting thought percy i would say is he 
none	 is genuinely filled with  gratitude towards the people who saved him from the abyss that he was falling into he is very  grateful he is many many things but he is deeply deeply grateful for the people in his  life and is willing to do some dumb stuff that he knows is dumb because of it  marisha yeah  taliesin i know i want to hear what im going to be killing in here let me know what dies tonight  marisha well i was going to say i think keyleth has her blind guidance that 
none	 i dont think shes  aware like her positive effect that she has on vox machina that i dont think  shes even aware of that i think she because keyleth is under the assumption that shes  constantly ignored and that people are like not no right no i know  liam i feel like she doesnt know that but  marisha i know that but shes i dont think she realizes the influences that i dont think  she actually realizes the power of her influence that she actually can wield for the better  taliesin im so 
none	 glad that she hasnt learned the mom voice yet  marisha no pike gets close  taliesin im not angry im just disappointed oh my god  marisha pike has gotten close a few times with grog with her youre like one look man one  look grog  ashley yeah ive got it down to a look instead of a word i think that was a moment in game of me  with travis being stop it do not die again  matt thats pretty great  liam were not going to clean this up afterwards were going to 
none	 cut it off right now  ashley when i watched it back i was when i watched it back when i saw the little gif i was  like yikes i was so intense  liam colin dorrey ejeansegast asks speaking of gilmore is vax bisexual duh good question  taliesin three on the kinsey scale  matt oh we have zoaga on reddit asks quick question for matt as weve seen youve tinkered  with the stats of the ancient dragons in the conclave without going into specific details do  you have any idea what kind of challenge 
none	 rating these modifications might put them at i dont i  try and measure it but a lot of the measurements are based on parties of four maybe five we have  a party of seven sometimes eight people when we have guests on and because of the nature of us  coming from pathfinder to this game and i tend to run games a little higherpower than the average  ive had to adjust a lot of the difficulty in the game which has been an interesting challenge for  me as a dm but also means that the 
none	 scale is going to continue to get more epic i have to tweak it  because we have a lot of powerful characters with powerful items but thats the kind of game i  wanted to run anyway the next game might be a little more lowpowered depending on where it  starts we shall see ive learned a lot remember i came into this  we went from  pathfinder to fifth edition when we started the stream really our first time playing fifth  edition so theres been balancing lessons learned as we progress and a lot of 
none	 circumstances that  caught me and the players offguard as far as difficulty thats part of the fun of the game so  for me its learning through experience previous encounters learning the players strengths and  weaknesses and finding ways to tweak creatures that better fit those to be a real challenge when  it has to be and to not be a real challenge when it doesnt have to be not every battle has to be  a fight to the death to the teeth ever because sometimes fights are enjoyable for players to show  up and 
none	 fight basilisks that once tore them asunder and be like oh we come back and we tear you  down its fun to have those quick victories sometimes but yeah you have to find it through  practice and the dmg scaling does help a lot but on this level this size of a party with what they  have at their disposal i kind of have to wing a lot of it  liam the raistlin level  ashley do we have does this go towards anything like is this extra credit  matt what this no theres no 
none	 experience points for this this is for fun this is just for fun  this is for the bragging rights of saying you can beat the shit out of the rest of your own party  liam theres a fun one for me someone said what characters do your kids play would you ever  introduce vax or vox machina into their quests i hadnt thought of that im going to do it thank  you for the suggestion i started with my son whos nine hes with three boys and my son is a  halfelf druid with a 
none	 dragonborn fighter and a dragonborn rogue then my daughter got interested  so i started doing a separate game with my daughter and my son where my son plays a dwarven  wizard and my daughter plays an elven druid and then my daughter got into it so now im doing one  with four girls where my daughter is a gnome rogue and theres a gnome cleric and there is a  gnome druid and a human monk and i am up to my neck in dungeons and dragons lately thank you  matthew mercer  matt laughs youre 
none	 welcome someone send him some best dad awards  marisha because ashley made a keyleth killing a child joke now i got the questions were there  ramifications for keyleth killing the child yeah  taliesin she still has to hear about it all the time  ashley but it was the one of the funniest moments in the game it was for me i thought it  was so funny which is terrible because you were just doing this amazing thing  liam youre all learning a lot about ashley right now  ashley i know i think if 
none	 i ever rolled another character it would be the most evil terrible person  liam yeah i think you have to  ashley for me i thought it was kind of funny because you were like i just want to help and  then he was like and you killed a child  liam you know its not real you know its paper and dice  taliesin and its really hard to find a greeting card for that like ive been looking for years  to find a popup snap  marisha hey sorry you killed a child oh god 
none	 oh god  matt thats horrible thats horrible  liam a musical card  ashley it was up there with the moment scanlan had the knife ready to go and then he kept going  out the window  taliesin yeah that was so amazing  marisha well i pretty much did the same thing too when i accidentally killed the halfdead  dwarf as minxie by picking him up by the neck when we were in the underdark  ashley by his scruff  marisha yeah i picked him up by the scruff and he had one hit point 
none	 left it was just enough  matt like snap ooh  marisha that was where the i try so hard and im the worst came from  ashley you have had so many of those moments and those are some of the best moments youve had so  many of those where youre like guys i got this im here to help  marisha yeah keyleths the worst shes  ashley no shes the best  matt the reactionary push into the lavas one of my favorites shes like i dont know what to  do im sorry just pushing 
none	 him down into the lava as hes like screaming im sorry that was so funny  marisha go to sleep go to sleep itll be over soon  laughter  liam on the flip side one of our home moments was amazing its actually on my vine account  which was keyleth walking up to a shambling mound was it a shambling mound  matt it was a corrupt treant  liam a corrupt treant we were going to have to fight that thing and you went blugh and it went  groaning and wandered off and we were all 
none	 like yelling  marisha no it was great  matt i cant remember what spell it was but it was something that essentially you can charm a  specific plantbased monster and it failed its saving throw it was going to be this epic  encounter with this giant corrupted treant in the middle of the bramble forest  marisha it was dominate plants during pathfinder days  matt yeah it was this big old bramble forest that led up to the actual home of the dread  emperor and it walked out and was like roars and youre like 
none	 sit down and sleep okay and  that was it and i was like well done  marisha you know i like believing in the what i like to call the community zodiac as in dan  harmons community and keyleth is definitely the britta of the community zodiac shes britta  matt i like that  taliesin no yeah i totally see that  liam what you got under that blanket  matt well well find out here shortly lets do one more question and then were going to take a  break and come back here for the 
none	 battle royale  marisha make it a good one  matt i know im trying to see lets go for the chat weve done a lot of these chat lets see  what we got thisll be our last question for the night  marisha keyleth is totally britta see  liam unless that is a hedge maze i am a dead man  taliesin thats another thing i think we need community fanart  marisha community fanart crossover community fanart  matt chat is going so fast its going so fast oh my god  liam if thats a 
none	 big room im gone  ashley that is not true  matt this is a quick throwaway it wont be the last one someone asked if i could ever join vox  machina what class and race would i be dwarf bard i think ive already specified that  taliesin thats pretty good  matt a good final end question  marisha someone said whats worse doors or dragons thats a pretty good question  matt well find out laughs well find out  liam cant read that stuff  matt i know its going so fast its okay im 
none	 glad you guys are so excited to ask questions but  i cant  taliesin wow its like  matt its like looking into the abyss  marisha yeah this is about the time where im like do i need glasses  taliesin its going to be three minutes of us staring at the  matt i can see through time  liam somebody asked heres a big question i didnt see it on there but somebody asked which  character dying would have the biggest overall effect on the group  matt i dont want to answer that because 
none	 then its going to subconsciously make me feel really  awful if they die i dont want to answer that  liam never mind bad idea  matt i dont want that to happen interesting idea  ashley do you have someone in your head though  matt no i dont i dont want that in my head i dont want any of that in my head if it happens  it happens  liam forget it what are the dimensions of the cube  matt the dimensions of the cube laughs sams cube  liam thats one by one 
none	  ashley forget it just how do we kill the dragon and then well stop  marisha yeah someone asked if umbrasyl was suicidally depressed yet  matt whos the hodor of the group oh were not going to talk about that also spoilers  taliesin spoilers god some of us havent had time  ashley have you watched it  taliesin i havent even started this season yet  matt hodor has an amazing moment  taliesin ive heard the internet told me  matt hush its awesome have you ever regretted a decision you made either in character 
dung	 or while  dming well have this as our final question for the evening  marisha regretted a decision in character or while dming  liam i got mine ready to go  marisha go  liam using my cape of the mountebank for the first time to teleport to the other side of the  glass and save everybody clunk oh fuck it was like my stomach just went  matt that was going to be their turn leave and hit the button as they left circumstance and you  went right there and hit it im like well 
none	 that saves them the problem of it  liam thought it was the door opener nope thats all right it was a great moment  matt it was a great moment but didnt quite work how you thought  liam whoops still alive for one more week  matt how about you guys  taliesin the treasure chest by far if i had killed vex i would have felt really really  terrible actually weirdly more outofcharacter than incharacter i would have felt really awful  because thats such a fourthgrade mistake really juniorhighlevel foolishness  matt thats okay anything 
none	 with you guys  marisha so many  ashley man theres so many theres so many little ones where im like groans  marisha i know all the time  liam death by a thousand cuts  marisha yeah oh no fuck you kilgrave well i get angry at keyleth sometimes for not being more  assertive and then theres some times that i want to say things as marisha for keyleth but im  like no she wouldnt she would be bowled over right now and she would go with it so theres  several times where im like 
none	 inhale fuck why couldnt you speak up and then theres some times  where the game moves faster than we can keep up with it and sometimes youre like i want this to  happen god there have been three separate times where ive wanted to come knock on your door and  it snaps the game rolls past it  liam its a lot of theater etiquette and improv its like youre like im going to oh no  theyre having a moment and then you kind of forget it or the moment passes and you got to let 
tavern	  it go  marisha yeah theater etiquette i remember and the audience noticed it and they were like if  they dont come back to this moment i came over and i sat down and i said we were in a tavern  and i said keyleth puts her head on vax she leans her head on vax  liam right and what i was thinking was gilmores over there and hes looking at this  marisha and then gilmore walked in  liam hes looking at this and i cant explain this  marisha no it was literally 
tavern	 like a fucking bar scenario i was like oh theres gilmore got to go  laughter  taliesin that whole bar episode was great  ashley i love that bar episode so much  taliesin yeah i want to yell at percy all the time he does dumb shit a lot and im like i got  to let it happen  liam vax and keyleth really like each other but this is them  marisha yeah cant sync up cannot  matt ross and rachel  taliesin did you just say that oh my god  marisha so much 
none	 ross and rachel oh my god so ross and rachel  matt thats my biggest regret as a dm was saying that right there  laughter  matt no i cant say i have any regrets as a dm storywise because i let you guys guide so much of  it i build stuff and let it happen and im usually happy with things how they turn out  whether or not i planned on it or not that to me is whats fascinating and interesting and fun as a  dm is being caught offguard and having to justify 
none	 and work with it on a constant improv level i may  have regrets mechanically i might forget elements in battle or might be circumstances that happen  for instance when gilmore came in and gave you guys the heroes feast not thinking at the time  it set you up for a battle with a purple worm and essentially disabled its most dangerous element  its tail poison i didnt realize it at the time because it just organically happened but im not  going to try and hold that back or restrain it in the moment it happened 
none	 to work out to be in your  favor and thats how it works sometimes i just let it happen so i wouldnt say i really have any  regrets not because im too good for them just because i let things happen and i appreciate it  for the good and the bad that comes with it and let the story guide itself  liam we entertain ourselves  matt i hope so laughs the moment that stops we need to stop doing this  marisha oh and to greg who says keyleth probably regrets not reading her spells 
none	 and im going to  join ashley and speak for you even though youre not asking for it we have a lot of fucking  spells man  ashley so many spells its so hard to keep track in the moment when youre stressed  marisha youre so stressed  taliesin and youll turn to me and be like am i reading this right and ill go oh yeah and then  a thing will happen like whoa  ashley thats happened so many times where youre like and ill show it to laura or travis and be  like 
none	 is this right  taliesin yeah yeah no this is going to be fine  marisha well and people dont understand either along with dm rulebending we dont necessarily  know how youre going to interpret the spell theres a ton of things like mist form that i  didnt know how it was going to act in the moment and it didnt mean i didnt read it i read all of  my spells hundreds of times i have hundreds i have hundreds and ive read all of them and i  will try them in the moment and 
none	 sometimes theyll work in my favor and sometimes they wont i dont  always know  matt which is fine a big part of dd is fucking up thats just how it is in any good game  theres going to be fuckups we just roll with it  taliesin yeah  liam its not appellate law  matt yeah well guys were going to come back here in a few minutes and do our battle royale  were going to go ahead and get you guys to use the restroom and get ready get your characters  weve leveled 
none	 everybody up  fierce growls laughter  matt for the purposes of this fight everyones been leveled up to a baseline level 14 so  everyones at an even scope  ashley because im behind  taliesin im behind  ashley oh okay okay okay  matt so lets go ahead and take a break well be back here in a few minutes and well see which  member of vox machina in this battle will stand supreme  liam the answer is not me  break  matt welcome back everybody were about to jump here in the battle

dung	 kick into  dramatic music  marisha oh my god you guys  matt so suddenly a flash of white takes your vision and as the white fades you see at the end  of a long blue skylike tunnel a man standing dark curly almost permed hair a suit with a  white wide polyester lapel white track pants and white shoes he approaches his chest almost  visible he speaks with you with confidence the voice of god the voice of everything he goes  hello vox machina i am the beyonder  laughter  matt and i 
none	 have decided for fun i wanted to see which one of you guys could fight i did this  thing once with a bunch of heroes and it got crazy so i am scaling it down you four lets  see who beats the crap out of the others shall we he snaps his fingers and with that it  flashes to black and the air around you gets hotter and hotter you feel yourself sweating in  darkness and suddenly your vision comes to you and you see before you a landscape of molten rock  and lava  
none	 taliesin is that actually your beyonder voice if it ever happens  matt thats exactly how i think a beyonder would sound if he were to show up in an event so that  being the case ladies and gentlemen lets go ahead and roll initiative  groans  ashley what  marisha where am i  matt youre right there  ashley and marisha this is ridiculous  liam im using a luck right now  marisha already so soon  matt roll initiative guys  marisha 18  matt all right ashley  ashley seven  matt okay

none	 didnt roll the right die  matt set it aside  taliesin thats 13 points off that so thats  liam how does that work  matt he basically grabs your dagger out of the air and stops some of the damage before it strikes  liam automatically or does he have to succeed to do it  matt no it just lowers the damage  taliesin thats 13 points off that so thats  matt 26 damage you take piercing damage and i need you to go ahead and make is it a  constitution saving throw  liam 
none	 yes 15 is the dc  taliesin constitution saving throw thats a d20 right  matt yes it is  taliesin yep  matt it succeeds  liam okay  matt what are you doing vax  liam now quick question matt if i were to attack him three times in a row right the next  two get no sneak attack i know that if i move to another target do they get sneak attack or no in  this instance  matt no you only get to sneak attack once per round  liam one time per round 
none	  matt correct and remember you have not activated your boots yet  liam i click them now  matt okay laughter  liam thanks buddy  matt looking at the item real fast too is there an activation cost for the boots  liam boots of haste laura has that piece of paper  matt oh right we will say for the purposes it would be a bonus action to activate it  liam whats the lighting like in here theres the light from  matt this whole room is low light it is just the glow from the 
none	 lava in here since a number of  you have darkvision its not a huge deal within 60 feet but it is considered technically low light  liam okay im going to use my action to go stealth thats action action bonus action  youre saying the boots i dont think i have ever used a bonus action before when clicking the  boots so we need to change things from here on out youve never called me on it in 50 games  matt right usually it was the first round that you did it but its fine  
none	 liam okay then with your permission i am going to use my i am going to throw another dagger i  totally miss and i am going to let it go it was a one i am going to step past that wall there i  can do it myself  matt you can you can reach out and actually change things as you are  liam okay im hasted so i get double speed as soon as im there whispering  matt okay go ahead and roll a stealth check  marisha taliesin and ashley singing secrets  marisha 
none	 second luck down already damn  matt all right i need keyleth and percy to roll perception checks  marisha 29  taliesin 11  matt okay you guys both actually all three of you watch as vax turns behind the corner and  vanishes from sight you have no idea where he is you know he is somewhere in this area but thats  all you know  marisha groans every damn time  laughter  matt that is the end of your turn keyleth youre up  marisha all right so bonus action is different than a free 
none	 action right  matt yeah  marisha okay as my action i am going to cast sunbeam  matt okay  marisha and i guess since percys the one in my line of sight i am going to be beaming it right  at percy  taliesin am i in line of sight yes i am in line of sight arent i do i have partial cover from  that no i dont  matt all right so youre firing it this way so what is the sunbeam all right percy i need  you to go ahead because it

none	 taking some of the impact  marisha counting 38 halved  taliesin 19 points  matt you take 19 points of radiant damage you are not blinded because you made your save  marisha that is true as a bonus action im going to cast grasping vine sorry percy  matt grasping vine unfortunately is a 4thlevel spell you have already cast a 6thlevel spell it  has to be 2nd or lower  marisha that is true never mind then  matt i got to pay attention to this stuff otherwise the internet lets me know  laughter  
none	 marisha im going to go earth elemental  matt okay  liam is it going to fit any more  matt barely  liam holy cow how high is the ceiling  matt laughing the ceiling actually is about 30 feet up its a domed cavern  liam so watch your head  matt you are set into this pocket of very hot earth with no foreseeable exit  marisha and i am going to sink into the ground  matt okay keyleth sinks beneath the ground as you do you suddenly feel yourself plummeting into  a pocket of 
none	 molten rock which is beneath this entire area here  marisha okay i come up really fast  matt okay but you still go ahead and take damage from this  ashley and we are dealing with molten lava  marisha this is happening fast  matt we will say here for the purposes of this everyone gets a nice view of the top of my head  taliesin bonus camera  matt counting  ashley we dont know where vax is  taliesin we do not know where vax is we know that he is back there somewhere  
none	 matt 35 points of fire damage from suddenly submerging yourself partially into molten rock and  as your rock form does help resist it somewhat it still begins to severely damage your earth  elemental form and you immediately pop back up into the space you were  marisha in that case  matt in that case  marisha im happy where i am  matt happy where you are  marisha ill stay there  matt okay keyleth ends her turn percy youre up  taliesin lets figure out what we are doing with this first of all im 
none	 going to you got away  you little son of a bitch youre hiding back there arent you  matt you see this giant earth elemental submerge and then come back out of the earth with elements  of superheated rock around the edges of its surface pike is off to the side looking about  trying to decide what shes going to do but you have the jump on her  taliesin first off im going to cast hex on keyleth for the moment because ive got to get  that thing off the board  matt as a 
none	 note keyleth by the way because you took fire damage i need you to make a  concentration check to maintain your sunbeam  marisha what do i have to roll  matt half the damage for how much did you take from that  marisha i took 35 damage yeah i am good  matt you rolled a  marisha 15  matt 15 plus your constitution yeah youre good  taliesin and im going to make you have disadvantage on strength checks  matt strength checks are at disadvantage while youre hexed what else you got percy

none	  matt right but because youre warbased you have divine strike its an extra d8 so 2d6 plus  1d8 there we go my apologies  ashley 17 points of damage  matt pike reaches back and slams into you with the frostbrand the cut of the blade is hard  enough but the cold enchantment on it causes the wound itself to seal with ice  taliesin wow im looking rough  matt anything else you want to do pike you have your bonus action still and your movement if you  wanted to try to move away its 
none	 up to you  pike im going to cast shield of faith on myself again can i do that  matt you just used your action shield of faith is a bonus action then yeah you can  ashley okay ill cast shield of faith on myself  matt so with that your radiant field of protective energy begins to shimmer across your  upper torso again helping to improve your armor class are you going to stay where you are or are  you going to move  ashley i can move ten feet oh i havent even moved

none	 only way that would aid you  liam now it gets interesting im going to take one step this way is this still burning  matt yeah its chilling there burning on this side  liam im going to throw a regular nonsneakattack dagger at pike terrible  matt as you pull back you see vax pop around the corner throw a dagger and it streaks off your  shield and you knock it out of the way  liam this is broken right this is gone  matt yes you can see through this part of the wall right 
dung	 there  liam is this wall here  matt that wall is still there  liam okay so what i want to do is use my movement to tuck in here press into the wall go  stealth thats good that is 28  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check pike  ashley 19 shit  matt you have no idea where vax is vax has essentially vanished from view  ashley what in the heck  liam ill tell you where im going im going to run to here  taliesin keyleth incinerates the entire cave 
none	  matt finishing that turn comes to keyleth  marisha fucking fuck i have no idea where vax is do i  matt nope you hid to keep out of the view of everything to be fair currently vax has no idea  where you are either  marisha right if i peek around this wall can i see pike  matt if you peek around right now you can go and look if you want to  marisha yeah  matt okay as you peek around the corner pike is currently not visible  marisha so no ones visible 
none	 whatsoever  matt nope  liam can i ask a quick question when i put those marbles down it went marbles rolling right a  nonrogue leaping over this wed all hear that right  matt a nonrogue leaping over there probably  liam unless they tried to make a stealth move  matt yeah you make noise when you run anyway regardless only a stealthy character whos  already hidden that it would be a thing  liam understood  marisha i still have my sphere up i dont know where anyone is fucking fuck  matt what do 
none	 you got keyleth  marisha i dont know what i would do aside from something defensive at this point  matt do you have any spells that cover an area that are helpful like faerie fire anything like that  marisha i didnt take faerie fire today  matt rough call against a rogue that would have been clutch but now you know for the future just  letting you know  liam tremor sense was good though  matt it was very good  marisha let me go ahead i do have sleet storm that i learned i think 
none	 its just an instant let  me see really quick  matt sleet storms an action  marisha 20foottall cylinder  matt with a 40foot radius centered at a point you choose within range  marisha 40foot radius 20foot tall 150foot range  matt yep where do you want to place it  marisha last i saw vax was over here  matt you saw him in this area  marisha im going to do here  matt centered from where  marisha here  matt centering it from there will only get this section if you center it further 
none	 out youll hit  more of an area just so you know from a tactical standpoint  marisha i kind of want to get pike  matt its a 40foot radius its going to hit everything  marisha well then sure lets do whats this counting  matt know that the radius is very big on this so before you put it too close to a wall you can  have more space  marisha lets do hereish  matt flaming sphere drops all right so the center is where  marisha counting yeah its right here  matt that 
none	 is the center of your sleet storm suddenly out of nowhere a burst of freezing rain  and sleet starts spilling out of the sky conjured from this temporal portal that pulls from some  distant elemental dimension as it hits the ground a lot of the lava begins to cool and  darken in certain areas this area begins to cool a little bit not entirely but its beginning to  fight against the cold temperature  marisha anything in that area has to make a dexterity saving throw  matt at the start of its turn yep  
none	 marisha or make a spell save dc or lose your concentration as well  matt thats true is that your action and do you move anywhere or do you stay where you are  marisha can i tuck back against the wall  matt yeah you tuck back against the wall there you are so that brings us to no longer percy  percy is gone sorry buddy crossing you off there pike your turn begins this sleet and rain  is hitting you from all over the place i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  liam 
dung	 percy was the fan favorite all day  taliesin was it well my money was on either you or me dying first  liam mine too  laughter  ashley eight  matt eight you immediately fall prone as the slick ice causes you to fall to the ground which  means itll take half your movement to stand up not a huge deal however any spells you are  concentrating in you have to make a successful constitution saving throw so make a constitution  saving throw  ashley ooh thats a natural one  matt you lose your 
none	 armor spell again so youre back down to an ac of 20 pike nows your turn  ashley okay that changes what i was going to do i will stand up  matt okay you have ten more feet to move so two more squares if you wanted to  ashley i am not going to move i am going to create a magic circle around myself and i am  going to  matt magic circle is a oneminute casting time that will take you ten rounds to cast  ashley never mind oh it is one minute  
none	 matt yeah sorry girl  ashley sorry thats why i made a lastminute decision okay you know what im just going to  stay there and im going to cast spirit guardians  matt spirit guardians  ashley yeah around myself  matt at what level  ashley third  matt which is the basic level  ashley sorry fourth level  matt all of a sudden there is another entity that has swirled around you this spectral image  of sarenrae is now looming over pikes form just waiting ending pikes turn now up to vax  ashley i 
none	 cant do anything else right  matt you have your bonus still if you wanted to do that  ashley im going to do shield of faith again  matt as a bonus action thats two concentration spells at once youll lose spirit guardians  yeah sorry  ashley okay okay okay ill do a healing word again  matt okay so heal seven that brings us to vax what are you doing buddy  liam i would like to pop back into existence right here and throw a dagger  matt technically shes inside this area there shes tucked 
none	 against the wall much like how you  were tucked against the wall there  liam i wouldnt have revealed myself if i had known that  matt you know shes around there but youd probably have to traverse  liam i thought she was five feet that way which would have changed everything  matt shed be further spaced out from there  liam thats everything that ive been working on for the last few minutes  matt sorry  liam instead of that because this is gone right  matt yes  liam can i see her from 
none	 here all right im going to materialize  matt however at the start of your turn i need you to make a dexterity saving throw because of  the sleet around you  liam sure i have advantage 11 or 11 what is with me 21  matt 21 whats the dc on your spell keyleth  marisha is it versus my spell dc  matt yes it is 19 yeah so you save youre fine no damage no prone  liam through the ice through the snow  matt this walls open  liam i have sharpshooter so does 
none	  matt yeah so she would have no cover on this  liam 21  matt 21 is that your ac with that sneak attack damage against keyleth  taliesin oh god the pain begins  liam counting 33  matt 33 points of piercing damage against you keyleth as the dagger hits you in the back of the  shoulder you feel a sharp pain its weird being on the opposing end of vaxs daggers  liam im going to dance back use bonus action to hide  matt make a stealth check  liam its a 27  
none	 matt pike i need you to roll a perception check  ashley pfft no not at all  liam and then my last action  matt okay and with that i need vax to make a dexterity saving throw  liam its a 21  matt 21 you manage to pull through the vicinity without any impact ending vaxs turn keyleth  youre up  marisha i still have the sleet storm up right  matt mmhmm although you do need to roll a concentration for the attack against you which  was thirtywhat  marisha 30 right ooh natural 
none	 19  matt 19 would be more than half youre fine and you maintain concentration half of that would  have been 16 or 17  marisha i just keep it up pike still hasnt really moved right shes still in her same position  matt yeah you dont see her you havent seen her for a while  marisha okay i want to peer around this corner and see if i can spot vax  matt technically also vax once again i need you to make a wisdom saving throw as well  liam for why so many things 
none	 not my strong suit 13  matt 13 chuckles you take 3d8 radiant damage  liam its a wisdombased thing  matt yep so go ahead and roll 3d8 as the spirit guardian thats been looming over and can see over  the wall and that whole vicinity as you run past both of those spells blast at you one of  them you manage to dodge but the sarenrae guardian reaches out and slams a giant light blade  down into you  marisha would i theoretically see that happening through this wall crack  matt no because youre 
none	 currently hiding behind the wall  liam is it a blade  matt it is a blast of energy but from a styling standpoint its a  liam so no uncanny dodge for that  matt you can uncanny dodge no this is not a spell attack against you it just happens so no  uncanny dodge would not help you on this  liam and its not a dexterity save so full hit  ashley 12 is it also the guardian of faith or no  matt he already went through that and saved fine so you take 12 
none	 points of radiant damage at the  end of your turn now its keyleth right  marisha yeah its my turn first i want to peer through the wall and see if i see vax at all  matt make a perception check natural one  marisha so since i dont see vax  taliesin not a lot of 20 in this game is there  matt not yet no  marisha has there been a 20  matt you did see some flashes of divine energy in that vicinity but thats all you see yeah in  this general 
none	 vicinity  marisha okay its a decision on if i want to im afraid if i do a fire storm and if i mock out  to pike if that would be considered metagaming if i knew where she is do i have an idea of where she is  matt you havent seen her for a while its up to you you can  marisha i dont want to be a dick i dont want to break the game let me ill just leave up my  sleet storm i guess im going to do a wall of stone 
none	 spell and i want to block off here and can  i do another column to block off here  matt yeah you have plenty of room there you can do all the way across there if you wanted to  marisha i want to leave a nice gap here if i can can i do that  matt you can do that if you wanted to  taliesin making yourself a private room  matt however its a concentration no we made into an instant spell the concentration made no  sense for wall of stone for older editions 
none	 that being the case were looking at currently now  stone walls up here and stone walls up here  taliesin hes in the room with you  marisha is he in the room with me im going to be really upset if hes in the room with me  matt you have no idea all right does that end you turn keyleth keyleth does that end your  turn all right pike youre up  ashley do i make a perception check  marisha oh and i tuck back against the wall  matt okay you tuck against the 
none	 wall if you want to go ahead and look around yeah  ashley is this included in the turn or will this take away something that i was going to do or is  this just a perception check  matt youve already made your perception check id say if you really wanted to honestly look for  him id let you take an action to do it  ashley i would have to roll a 20  matt yeah you have no idea where he is right now  ashley okay you know what im going to since i 
none	 saw that the spirit guardian went off  matt yeah you saw it go off around that area and strike down over the edge of the wall this way  ashley i would like to insect plague  marisha yes ive always wanted to do this spell yes do it its not our style so we cant do it  in the real game  matt singing insect plague normal voice it is concentration so this would  ashley get rid of spirit guardians  matt up to you it is a 20foot radius where do you want to put 
none	 it  ashley i want to put it around that area  matt which one around this area okay so keeping you outside the radius where do you want  it to go this whole area there the center where it went off okay but keeping you out of the  radius i imagine so maybe putting you about there would get this whole area there  ashley if hes not in there this is going to blow  matt you drop down insect plague your spirit guardian vanishes as instead suddenly swirling  from the cracks in the ground 
none	 a cloud of biting scarabs locusts and various poisonous insects  begin to fill the area the loud buzzing sound fills the entire area vax i need you to make a  constitution saving throw  taliesin whoa  liam you nudged her towards that corner mercer you nudged her towards that corner  matt no she said where it happened but away from herself it would have been  marisha is that a natural one  matt natural one 4d10 piercing damage  marisha doesnt he also have some sort of poison from insect plague or something like that 
none	  matt no its just piercing damage things biting and clawing at him  liam and theres no uncanny dodge because its an area  matt correct yeah only against directed spell attacks  liam four tens  ashley how many did i roll  matt four what you did do  ashley 13  matt 13 points of piercing damage  marisha rough thats a pretty shitty roll though  matt you see all of a sudden all the insects coalesce and start biting in an area you see the  shape of vax appearing in this corner there 
none	 briefly as the insects are biting you want to  move still  ashley yes id like to move can i move in between between the walls  matt you can move over there if you want to  ashley yeah ill move in there not that thats that far away from him but maybe he didnt see  because bugs are biting him  matt so through the pains and anger and the cloud you can just the area is lightly obscured  ashley do i have a bonus action im going to can i cast shield of faith 
none	 on myself again  matt you can but youll lose your insect plague  ashley never mind is that continuous  matt its concentration yeah the insects stay until you leave the area so lets see here  thats part of that there ending pikes turn that brings us to vax  liam will you allow me to go to here and then jason bourne behind these like a boss and go  stealth right there  matt there is no way to see through these walls right now technically  liam oh i thought there was a gap  
none	 matt its in the design  liam im right here im gonna go stealth  matt however you do also need to make a dexterity saving throw as you rush into the radius  marisha would that affect pike too on her move sleet storm  matt technically yeah thank you for reminding me  liam this is the sleet storm that im dexing  matt this will be the sleet storm you make one as well  ashley a dex saving throw  liam 20  ashley wow three  matt three you would have not been able to 
none	 get over there you would have gotten to there with  your full movement you had to use half of it to get up  liam stealth is 27  ashley this is so stressful  matt she technically only got that far so you know  liam is that where she was standing at the beginning of my turn then i want to do it here instead  matt okay now make another dexterity check no a dexterity saving throw sorry as you rush into  the radius of her guardian  liam didnt she dispel it for the 
none	 bugs  matt no she has two up one of them isnt concentration  marisha oh the guardian is not concentration  matt it lasts for eight hours  marisha thats dope holy fuck thats dope  liam 24  ashley yeah youre fine  liam stealth and i will i havent taken an action yet because that was a bonus  marisha youve rolled so much and you havent done anything  ashley is he going stealth god dangit  matt its what he does  taliesin its like trying to hit him with a spotlight and then throw 
none	 everything you can at him  marisha it totally is i should have fucking packed faerie fire that was stupid  ashley what is faerie fire  marisha it lights up everything i took cure wounds and thunderwave and healing word instead  for my 1stlevel spells its a really good 1stlevel spell  taliesin it is its an antirogue spell  matt got it okay that ends vaxs turn keyleth youre up you watch as this cloud of insects  appears in this corner you see a coughing vax run this way to the edge and then disappear behind 
none	 that wall  marisha he disappears over here through this wall  matt he disappears through this little channel here and he doesnt appear to leave it theres  still insects filling this whole space here  liam disappeared into the bugs man  marisha into bugs into bugs into bugs bugs bugs totally with you there  matt this is getting real interesting  marisha okay hang on a second hang on hang on sorry im doublechecking something before i do  something stupid  matt yeah not too bad  marisha okay im going to pop around the 
none	 corner and im going to do fire storm all up where i  think theres bitches so since i saw vax go this way and a bunch of action and a bunch of insects  over here im going to start it here  matt okay so well say cube cube cube  marisha ill probably try and get this corner too cube  matt and marisha counting  matt covering this vicinity here  marisha yeah counting  matt okay so suddenly the ground already hot bursts forth in flames surrounding the whole area  whats the saving throw 
none	 on that  marisha dex  matt pike i need you to roll a dex saving throw  marisha just pike  matt yeah just pike  ashley six  matt all right go ahead and roll damage  marisha thats 7d10  laughter  marisha yells anger  liam in another life somewhere im very much in love with you but not this day  ashley 7d10  matt i know someone in the chats paying attention and i lost track of that how many  rounds have we gone so far  marisha ooh 24 34 43 plus 
none	 another five 48 points of fire damage  ashley shit okay  matt i should not have asked chat laughs  liam what spells are going on right now ice storms still happening  marisha apparently 13 critrolestats is the only one we trust  matt okay so just so youre aware the surge of energy that you felt from your boots has faded  you no longer have the haste enchantment  ashley phew okay  liam has it already been ten rounds already  matt yeah its been 13 youve technically had it for more rounds than you 
none	 shouldve but its fine  taliesin the beyonder is a mysterious creature the laws of physics do not apply here  matt all right so is that your turn what else are you doing  marisha hiding again  matt okay so you move back into this little area there  marisha and im still maintaining my ice storm  matt are you moving further back this way or staying in that same pocket there  marisha just sucking up in that pocket against the wall  matt okay well say there all right cool that ends keyleths turn pike 
none	 youre up the flames  that erupt around you subside youre finding yourself singed and burned and angry i need you  to go ahead and roll a constitution check to see if you maintain how much damage did you take  total from that  marisha 48  matt 48 damage roll a constitution check you have to beat a 24  ashley i have to beat a 24 theres no way yeah theres no way  matt insect plague fades away the insects subside and vanish  ashley okay okay okay  marisha were so frustrating against ourselves 
none	  taliesin this is phenomenal to watch  ashley im going to cast cure wounds on myself  matt go for it what level are you doing it  ashley four  matt level four okay im pretty sure this is all your 4thlevel spells right  ashley i have one more  matt you have one more  ashley well i have two after this one ill have one more  matt you have two but im pretty sure spirit guardians you put that at a higher level thats  right what was it guardian  ashley okay  
none	 matt no thats true your guardian of faith was 4thlevel you couldnt do that at a higher  level so this would be your last 4thlevel spell  ashley because i have four because of the ring  matt oh  ashley keyleths ring yeah  liam whyd you give her that ring  marisha seemed like a good idea at the time never give her the ring  liam was this some sort of hunger games deal  matt so the ring gives you an additional four levels in spells okay  marisha are you talking about my spell 
none	 slot ring of holding my level five spell slot ring holding  ashley yeah yes  matt okay  marisha well it would mean you would have a 4thlevel and you could have a level one  matt they have to have already been prepared is how it would work well say you had your guardian  spirit as what you had in there as part of your plan anyway so thats fine  marisha i took your cloak so i technically have your cloak from if were going from the last game  matt were using the basic gear 
none	 you would have normally so technically you would have that ring  marisha its normally my ring  ashley i dont think thats what it is  marisha there were two rings we got a 5thlevel that kept and then there was a lower level  matt there was a 3rdlevel one  marisha there was a 3rdlevel that i might have given you  matt anyway for the time being as were on  taliesin im reading chat and everyones like wow taliesins spaced out no im just reading  chat im just watching it  marisha no its 
none	 just we actually get to see chat  taliesin normally dont get to see chat  ashley now ill move does that last for a long time or is that a onetime deal the flame storm  matt its a onetime thing  ashley okay so im going to tuck back behind that wall  matt over here back around this way or this way  ashley just back towards my guardian of faith not visible though in between  matt okay this section okay all right that ends pikes turn vax youre up  marisha where the fuck are 
none	 you because youre not in my fucking fire storm  liam hi right at pike  marisha he wasnt in my son of a dick  liam oh thats a natural one okay so  matt pike as you run up all of a sudden you hear a ting and a blade streaks off the back of  your armor you turn the corner and you see vax looking there sheepishly  ashley ooh and so now i see him  matt you do youre no longer hasted  liam i know i know  marisha im not your friend 
none	 buddy  taliesin im not your buddy friend  marisha im not your friend pal  liam is this out of sight here is this a solid wall  matt yeah that would be a solid wall  liam okay im going to roll stealth there thats a 25 so  matt go ahead and roll a perception check just to keep that in mind  ashley is he invisible no 19  matt no you just see him duck on the other side of the wall and vanish  ashley damn it  liam i want to go  
none	 matt rogues man  taliesin theyre still doing south park  marisha well it takes a while for them to catch up  ashley how are we healthwise everybody  taliesin keyleth is fine she may even be pristine  marisha im not pristine ive taken sneakattack damage which hurt badly  matt okay that ends vaxs turn keyleth youre up  marisha keyleth is up okay keyleth is going to peek around the corner i can see pike right  matt nope you cant see anybody  marisha i cant see pike through this  matt no these walls 
none	 are full walls these arent little  marisha oh solid wall i cant see anybody  matt nope your guess is as good as anybodys  marisha great great i thought i was going to be able to see her  matt sleet storm was dropped guys its all good  marisha was sleet storm dropped  matt yeah you took a bunch of damage no you didnt its still going im so confused by all  your spells  marisha so he still has to make dex checks right so does she and so concentrations i  should remember 
none	 it and i did  matt im trying to keep all this in my head ugh  liam dex save 24  matt okay pike make a dex save  ashley okay i did move 16  matt yeah even though you probably didnt move that far so you would have just moved back half  your movement so youre fine its fine didnt make a huge difference  marisha okay  matt its true you do confuse me love you guys but you do confuse me  marisha i cant see anybody through my window then right  matt 
none	 no you have locked yourself into a bunker with a very limited viewpoint  taliesin metaphor  marisha i died really quickly last time i didnt want to  matt so you can either wait it out or start making a guessing game  marisha but thats the thing its the guessing game i dont have a lot of aoes at this point  actually you know what i brought tidal wave where was the last action that i saw i saw shit  go down over here  matt you didnt see anything you ducked behind that wall  
none	 marisha okay so the last thing that i realistically saw was insects and  matt still insects over here dashes of light over here yeah and you saw pike over here get flamed  marisha okay let me peek around the corner can i do a quick perception check to see if i can spot  any movement or  matt sure make a perception check  laughter  matt its hard to see through the sleet right now man all that sleet is helping you but its  also you cant see shit  liam is that an action 
none	 like an effort for pike would waste an action  matt yeah  marisha if i cant see anybody i cant do anything i dont have line of sight and i  literally burned my aoe spell that i brought for the day  liam yeah youre in a pickle  laughter  matt youre such an asshole  marisha such a dick im going to cast cure wounds a level two cure wounds on myself because  i cant see shit  matt remember you can also hold your action in case something  marisha thats true  matt 
none	 you can have a spell ready and have it trigger for a spell that can happen once it occurs  marisha thats true i never do that because im a melee person well let me just cure myself  since i already said i was going to do it so im going to roll a 2ndlevel cure wounds which is  and then im going to tuck back behind my wall because thats where im happy in my box level two  matt so thats 2d8 plus six for you 13 you heal 13 hit points pike youre up  
none	 ashley okay so im going to cast cure wounds on myself again at 2ndlevel  matt so 2d8 plus five  ashley okay so 15 and then shield of faith as a bonus action and im going to stay for now  matt all right shield of faith is up again protecting you standing where you are not moving  anywhere all right cool vax youre up  liam yeah  matt oh at the top of your turn by the way because sleets still moving dexterity saving throw  ashley i didnt move  matt you didnt move so 
none	 it wouldnt have made a huge difference anyway so thats fine  marisha but concentration spell  matt she cast it at the end of her turn she already lost concentration because of your last  flaming column of fire of doom  marisha burn burn burn  matt so dexterity saving throw  liam is a 23  matt yeah youre fine  liam okay  ashley where the fuck are you  taliesin its like wheres waldo with knives  marisha it totally is if waldo was a serial killer  taliesin creepy voice where am i  
dung	 ashley i mean we cant  taliesin i would think a dark reboot of wheres waldo would do really well  marisha that would be phenomenal like a freddy krueger wheres waldo  ashley if you find him you die this is rough  matt all right that ends vaxs turn keyleth youre up  ashley hes right behind me isnt he  marisha again already okay im going to peek around my corner do i see anybody another  perception check im going to peek through my wall of my hole that ive made  matt this is your 
none	 action to take your perception by the way  marisha its an action  matt bonus action well say 27 what did you roll  marisha 27 to see where the fuck you are  liam perception i rolled well heres the thing let me tell you  taliesin i imagine a little chessboard  matt are you looking through this way  marisha im looking through this wall  matt you dont see anything  marisha then i prepare a blight spell and i hold  matt until  marisha until i see either pike or vax appear in 
none	 my view  matt okay good to know all right that brings us to pikes turn pike what are you doing  ashley im going to hold my turn until someone attacks me  marisha nobody move  matt you cant hold your whole turn you have an action prepared what do you want to do with your action  ashley if someone attacks me then im going to attack back  matt okay so youre going to hold your attack action until somebody attacks you okay  ashley come out of hiding motherfucker  marisha come out come out 
none	 wherever you are  matt that brings us to vaxs turn  ashley whistles as if for a dog  matt okay it is now keyleths turn  marisha are you just fucking hiding motherfucker are you just waiting this out are  you camping right now are you being a fucking camper  liam this is intents  taliesin wow  matt im going to give you damage for that laughs im kidding this is turning into a bad  counterstrike match real fast  marisha im going to do another scan to see if i can find the 
none	 motherfucker  matt looking out where  marisha my same hole and then probably nothing 18  matt nothing  marisha okay someones got to do something here let me see what do i have in my bag papas got a  brand new bag i am going to  matt youre on deck pike  marisha i still have a blight spell prepared right  matt you didnt cast it it never happened  marisha so i put it away  matt yeah you didnt actually cast it you were ready that if it happened you would do it 
none	  immediately you could do the same thing if you wanted to though it seems like everyone is doing  nothing right now so if this continues im going to have to shake things up  marisha im going to crawl out of the wall here crawl over this is still lava flow correct  matt it is but the sleet spell has cooled it and most of this now is darkened rock again  actually due to the constant cold rain and snow its still hot in there but theres a shell of  rock over it youre not 
none	 sure how strong it is  marisha all right heres what i want to do then  matt also how does the sleet spell work you may have walked into your own spell radius  taliesin that would be never mind  matt when a creature enters the spell area yeah if you dont want to do that you can back up but  otherwise youd be walking right into your sleet spell  marisha i didnt realize it would stretch that far  matt yeah its a 40foot radius so its out to here  marisha okay im going 
none	 to sorry theres a lot going on  matt what are you doing  marisha im trying to figure it out i dont have a whole lot im going to cast a tidal wave im  going to leave my sleet spell up i guess i will cast a tidal wave which is in this thing ten  feet wide ten feet tall  matt yup  marisha 30foot long  matt yup so you have a tenfootwide column you can put anywhere for 30 feet  marisha anywhere in a 20foot radius so i can see here correct i 
none	 want to do it going this way  matt starting from where  marisha here where i can see and going this way  matt okay five ten 15 20 25 30 would just hit pike all right so pike as youre waiting  and waiting all of a sudden you see this surge of water come splashing across the way towards you  you turn make a dexterity check or a dexterity saving throw sorry  liam whats the spell  matt tidal wave its what she used to destroy the elementals  marisha yeah its instantaneous so my 
none	 thing is still up  ashley 17  marisha fail  matt so you take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone here  ashley 4d6  marisha 4d8 so thats eight 16 17 wait 4d8 17  matt 17 points of bludgeoning damage and you are knocked prone as the wave crashes over you  dissipating into the stonework around leaving little puddles that begin to steam and boil upon  the impact across the ground even as the sleet storm is crashing all around you  marisha thats my turn  matt all righty youre up pike 
none	  marisha and im going to tuck back up against my wall  ashley okay so  matt okay at the top of your turn you need to make a constitution saving throw  marisha sleet storm is still up sleet storm sleet storm  ashley 19  matt yeah so you maintain your armor  ashley okay can i just get up and then go to the middle part of the walls  matt you can move there thats about as far as you can get with only half your movement left so  ashley okay can i just 
none	 start swinging and see if i can hit him if hes in there  matt if you want to just make an attack up here okay roll an attack  ashley i mean hes not in there but i mean 28  matt 28 whoosh through the air nothing there  marisha 28 is such a great roll too  matt all right is that all youre going to do on your turn  ashley sighs yeah yeah  matt all right vax youre up  liam okay im telling you what im doing right now its interesting  matt

none	 lightning hits the floor smashes into the  ground rocks get thrown no apparent effect all right you going to go back in your corner all  right pike youre up  ashley okay im going to cast death ward on myself my last fourth  matt last fourth spell death ward on pike boom im going to wait what else are you doing  ashley okay so ugh so frustrating because i cant see him can i make a spiritual weapon to  see stealthy people like stealth goggles  matt you can make a spiritual weapon that can 
none	 move around and be a danger but cant really make  it to help you see stuff  ashley i know i was just trying  matt i mean an extra bonus action attack doesnt hurt if something does show up so up to you  what do you want to do  ashley okay yeah im going to put a spiritual weapon just hovering that sweet sword of sarenrae  matt okay what level  ashley second  matt okay so a basic spiritual weapon appears ill go with this yellow one where do you want it  to 
none	 go  ashley just right above me  matt right above you all right so thatll be right there okay that end your turn all right suddenly  liam whispering aw dang it  matt the entirety of the room begins to quake and shift you hear the cracking as all of a sudden  every stone wall bursts forth and molten rock begins to spill into the territory all the walls  now five feet of lava have filled in show me on the map where you last were  liam where i last was  matt yes show 
none	 me  liam okay  matt okay i need you to make a dexterity saving throw dont have advantage anymore because haste  is gone  liam i know that is a 30 i think hold on  matt yeah its plenty so you dodge out of the way just in time however you guys watch as all  the walls now within five feet of them are now just spilling lava and its filling into the  room you get the sense that its going to continue to fill with each passing round  liam you mean closing in

none	 within  five feet  ashley and each square is five okay ill just keep it with me  matt okay cool top of the round the lava begins to pool further into the room you guys  notice now as molten rock is now beginning to spill at the tenfoot radius around the walls  pike its starting to get close to closing off the exit of this wall you see it now beginning to  spill into this lava form there  marisha i have my wall of stone up here and here  matt correct but its 
none	 still spilling out of all the walls on each side  marisha sure right  matt you need to make another dexterity check  liam even though i stepped one in  matt you stepped one in away from it and then it moved in one more  liam okay ohh one  matt one  taliesin welcome to the club  matt you take 42 points of fire damage  taliesin whoa  matt as the lava surges past you you manage to just step out of the very edge but a familiar  sensation hits you as the 
none	 severe pain you once held in one foot you now feel in both all  righty vax its your turn  liam okay im going to materialize ill have gone one two three four five to here im  going to throw a dagger  matt the moment you appear keyleth you get your blight spell  marisha hey baby okay  liam i havent walked up to you but if its ranged  matt no its ranged its a 30foot range as soon as you appear no constitution saving throw  liam constitution i am doomed doomed doomed so

none	 blight spell you see the veins of black curl up his body as his skin begins to curl and tear open  in certain places and he falls facedown on the edge of this lava pool right there one hand kind  of like sizzling fingers beginning to catch flame as it just touches the edge of the lava  marisha highpitched sorry this is like a nightmare i had  laughter  marisha i feel so guilty  matt all right keyleth its your turn  marisha okay vax is down  matt vax is down  marisha how 
none	 sadistic do i want to be  matt its up to you what do you want to do  marisha in typical keyleth fashion i walk up to vax and i say so sorry im so sorry and i push  him into the lava  laughter  liam so what do i do  matt you dont do anything as she kicks your unconscious form into the molten rock and your  body slowly burns away  liam and the death ward does nothing against that death save advantage all of that nothing  matt this isnt so much 
none	 about death saving throws as your unconscious body unable to do anything  is being pushed slowly into molten rock vax is no more  marisha wait wait wait ill never let go ill never let go vax  liam so stupid rose so stupid rose  matt you watch as the molten rock takes his arm as it slowly disappears beneath the lava  marisha it turns into a middle finger and disappears beneath the molten rock  liam thats totally on me i wasnt paying attention i heard you say blight and i should  have stayed put 
none	 that was my mistake  matt so thats your action kicking his body into the lava  marisha that was gnarly  matt what do you want to do now you still have a move and a bonus if you wanted to use it  marisha i still have a move and a bonus  taliesin remember the walls are caving in  marisha yeah i know  matt i know you wouldnt sink in lava its fantasy lava every time i look over to chat  theres just someone ugh  liam guys its a game  matt its 
none	 fun were having a good time she pushed him partially into it and he just burst  into flames is what really would have happened but its fine  ashley down to the ladies  matt its all good the physics in exandria are different than your normal mortal realm all  right so you move over there and youre done  marisha i move over there and still have a bonus right all right i am going to healing word myself  matt so 1d4 plus six  marisha yeah im just going to do firstlevel here just to 
none	 top me off  matt and pike youre up after this  marisha four  taliesin ten points  matt all right pike youre up dude you had a good game  liam amazing so much fun  taliesin you were metal  ashley im going to peek out  matt all right you peek around the corner and you see keyleth immediately off across the lava  you also see there is lava lapping at your foot and you can see it moving slowly in your direction  ashley so how far can i move  matt well first 
none	 off the sleet spell you let go for call lightning  ashley so how far can i move around right here  matt thats five ten you can move all the way over here if you want its up to you or over here  ashley and is there lava over here okay im going to move right here  matt okay you move right there all right and you can use your bonus action to move your blade  if you want to as well 20 feet so youre going to do that  ashley yeah ill do that 
none	  matt five ten where do you want to go for the rest of it towards keyleth 15 20 it just  floats over the lava so its fine  ashley i am going to cast harm on keyleth  marisha that sounds horrible i dont even know what that is  matt oh youre about to find out is what youre about to find out oh no okay  liam while matt flips what i was going to do before i forgot that was stab you in the back and  then just wrench you down into the lava 
none	  matt keyleth make a constitution saving throw giggling oh no  ashley hey no man this is a good matchup though because  liam three  matt all right you take 14d6 necrotic damage  taliesin would you like some extra d6  marisha 14d6  liam take my sneak attack dice  taliesin counting there you go all of that  marisha all of them roll them all at once yes  taliesin wow oh my god  matt reroll the cocked one  ashley oh that changed that one oh well  matt thats fine  ashley 
none	 counting  liam i want a fistfight at the end of this  marisha just go out to the parking lot take our shirts off rage sound  liam ow you hit me in the ear  marisha stop pulling my hair  ashley 44  matt 44 points of necrotic damage by the way your max health is also reduced by 44  liam that necrotic stuff hurts huh  matt what does that bring you to  marisha 31 points right or 95 minus 44 i way overcompensated 51 not 31  matt 51 hit points all right 
none	 so thats your harm spell  ashley yikes okay and then im going to cast no thats all i can do right because i did the  bonus action to move the spiritual weapon  matt yep thats it youre done all right keyleth top of the round the lava pools in even  further and now three squares away from the wall are currently filled now so you guys are starting  to get pushed into the lava pool in the center you probably have two very careful rounds before  youre both taking lava damage yeah you guys 
none	 can see each other its right down to this  lavafilled room the glow of the molten rock around you underlighting you both as youre  standing in the center around this pool staring at one another for the final showdown you hear  the laughing of the beyonder in the distance doofusesque voice heh heh this is great  ashley oh gosh shes going to kill me shes going to kill me  marisha okay so first i want to do just as my action a call lightning right onto pike  matt all right pike i need you 
none	 to roll a dexterity saving throw your favorite  ashley natural 20  matt oh shit all right  marisha the first natural 20 of the night  matt so roll 3d10 lightning damage halved  ashley nice  marisha 22 halved 11  matt 11 points of lightning damage as the lightning hits you charging though your body the  war cleric in you fills up with even more rage  marisha now i want to use my bonus action to cast blight or sorry no to cast grasping vine  taliesin oh shit  ashley i think im 
none	 done im done for im done for  marisha i fucking love lava by the way if i can do it here  matt all right so a vine whips out 30 feet counting yeah shes in range  ashley oh shit  matt all right so pike i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  liam brutal  ashley yeah it gets me  matt the vine streaks out black and charred almost like the dead foresttype exterior it  whips around you and drags you forward 20 feet into the center of the lava you take 
none	 giggling  oh my god this is not good for you all right so thats 45 points of fire damage  ashley 45 oh shit  matt as youre now being pulled into this hard but super molten rock shell your whole body bursts into  flames as now the flaming fires of righteousness of sarenrae are now met by the flaming fires of  your flesh actually burning off what are you at healthwise  ashley im at four i have death ward not that thats probably even going to do anything  liam oh look this ones gloating 
none	 already  matt keyleth thats the end of your turn all right pike youre up pike you can move out of  this because if you stay in there at the end of your turn youre going to take the damage again  ashley shouting fuck okay so hmm  matt the vines still right there ready to grab you again  ashley okay can i take my spiritual weapons and cut off the vines  matt the grasping vine itself is more of an effect that she can continue to have more vines  grow out of it so 
none	 its not going to do much youve seen it before you know how it works  ashley oh boy oh boy oh boy  matt the vine can only pull towards it  marisha thats true its not a grapple  matt yeah so if you were to move towards the vine it wouldnt be able to pull you into the  lava again essentially  ashley so i need to get out yeah im going to get out  matt which direction  ashley where is the lava now  matt the vines right there the lava has now 
none	 pooled into here youre only really going to have  this space and this space  ashley okay so ill just crawl out towards her im done im done i cant do anything  liam youve still got high ac  ashley do i still have a spell  matt yeah you havent done anything all you did was move as a bonus action you could move this  over to attack her if you wanted to  ashley in addition to doing something else  matt yeah as a bonus action although it is a concentration spell and i 
none	 need you to roll  against 44 points of damage roll a constitution check  ashley okay 19  matt plus your constitution oh with your constitution nah spiritual weapon is gone  ashley okay so shit ive got to play this correctly youre 51  liam got anything that can put her in the pool your biggest damage right there  marisha its like a pool party wrestling match  taliesin sear your shame lock in the flavor  ashley okay so i do have a 3rdlevel can i throw her ass into the lava  matt if you 
none	 wanted to try and shove her there is lava right behind her there  ashley okay im going to try and shove her with my no im going to command her to jump into the  pool of lava  matt you can command one word  liam swim  taliesin dont help dont help  ashley yeah how do i word this whats the word jump ah fuck  matt you can try let me see here let me look at this real fast  liam what does that penguin say slide  marisha slide now slide now slide 
none	 now dip baby dip  matt it has no effect if your command is directly harmful to it so it wouldnt work  ashley okay so ill just shove her back into the lava thats behind her  liam hold on let me take my earrings off  ashley i mean what can i do at this point  matt this is going to be interesting all right so you move into here well you can probably do  it from here because technically youre both adjacent at this point go ahead and you can make  a shove as 
none	 your attack  ashley yeah i dont know how to do that or i can use my frostbrand  matt make a strength athletics check  ashley okay strength and athletics okay so 16  matt all right you can roll either an athletics or an acrobatics check keyleth  marisha ill take athletics for that 14  matt pike rushes around the corner with her shield and slams into you you get pushed back  into the lava that has curled out from that side  marisha oh hot oh hot hot hot  matt lets see yeah okay 
none	 so keyleth takes as part of this action 19 29 35 points of fire  damage from the shove  marisha im alive im alive  matt youre alive all right pike does that end your turn  ashley yeah theres nothing else i can do right  matt you havent used your bonus action yet i dont think you used your action to shove  ashley and i cant use a 7thlevel correct if its a bonus action  its a bonus action  marisha a 7thlevel spell you have a bonus action 7thlevel spell what the fuck  
none	 matt what spell is it  ashley divine word  matt divine word let me pull this up real fast divine word is a bonus action yeah laughs in surprise  okay yeah you can do this  ashley i can  matt you can yeah because you used your action to shove all right keyleth i need you to make a  charisma saving throw  marisha sarcastically oh my strongest points  matt laughs i know  marisha plus three nine  matt how many hit points are you at  marisha 16  matt ashley how do 
none	 you want to do this  marisha oh shut up  matt so how divine word works you utter a divine word imbued with the power that shaped the  world at the dawn of creation because clerics choose any number of creatures you can see within  range each creature that can hear you must make a charisma saving throw on a failed save a  creature suffers an effect based on its hit points 50 or lower theyre deafened for a  minute 40 or lower theyre deafened and blinded for ten minutes 30 or lower theyre blinded 
none	  deafened and stunned for an hour 20 hit points or lower killed instantly ashley how do you  want to do this  ashley all right im going to walk over to her because shes down right  matt shes in the lava right now  marisha im in the lava just screaming bloody murder  ashley im going to just touch her hair and im going to say tender voice im sorry but i need  to kill you and smoosh her face into the lava  laughter  matt as you slam her head down radiant divine 
dung	 energy fills the space around you and then curls  dark as you push your friend facedown into the lava you hear her screams muffled as the molten  rock begins to consume her hair burning off her head the divine energy protecting you from the  heat as you pull back suddenly this smoldering smoky ruin that was once keyleth begins to slowly  melt away against the tide of lava the pouring rock halts in place as a voice goes and i  have my victor suddenly the lava right behind you tears open and you find yourself 
none	 falling  plummeting into darkness and the plummeting turns into just falling and falling then light begins  to fill the space beneath you and you look down as a small platform of marble approaches you you  think youre about to crash into it at full terminal velocity instead your feet gingerly  touch and you come to stand there the same strange whiteclad jheri curlhaired gentleman  walks up to you and goes well played and highfives you ill send you on back your  friends are fine and then you see the corpses of your three friends 
none	 rise up out of the marble  still as wrecked as they were from the battle  ashley hi sorry  liam were really more of a comingled milkshake well be together forever  matt its a little disturbing he hasnt restored them to their actual form they all start  shambling towards you he goes oh sorry about that er this was a dream snaps and he goes to darkness  well done congratulations  cheering  liam the monstah  ashley the monstah oh down to the nittygritties  matt four hit points the lava pushing in that 
none	 was crazy i didnt realize that was a bonus action  ashley i didnt realize it was a bonus action until you were like you have a bonus action and  i looked down and i was like okay well oh shit  marisha had you rolled a few points higher on that lava she would have been dead or had i  rolled higher on my lightning  ashley with death ward would that have done anything or no  matt it would have brought you back to one  ashley okay so i would have still had that 
none	 one hit point  liam also when you cast that blight on me i had 14 hit points whatever number of hit points i had  is what you hit me for  matt laughing oh that sucks you put necrotic resistance specifically because you were afraid of  blight yeah  liam by the way she texted me today going but i wont use that on you i promise  laughter  marisha oh i totally did say that didnt i  liam yeah no i knew that you were a liar liar  marisha if it makes you 
none	 feel better i kind of forgot about it between now and then  laughter  ashley travis just texted me and said i am so proud my buddy  matt aww  ashley wow i was not expecting that  marisha so wait i have a question my armor has spell resistance which gives me advantage on  saving throws  matt spell resistance gives you advantage on spell saving throws yes  marisha but that wouldnt have helped against her thing just now  matt no it wouldve yep  marisha but i didnt have to roll to save 
none	  matt it was a charisma saving throw  marisha oh my god it was a charisma saving throw i would have had advantage  matt roll again the outcomes already happened but  marisha its already happened i rolled an 18  matt what was your charisma bonus  marisha plus three so 21  matt your charisma saving throw bonus is plus three  marisha yeah because i have the ring of protection i gain a plus two bonus to ac and  saving throws  matt well this is a valuable lesson in remembering what your spells 
none	 can do  marisha what my armor does yeah so i would have saved against that  matt possibly yeah  marisha fucking fuck a 21 i would have saved  ashley you would have saved  matt it was an epic end  liam but you also accidentally benefited from something we werent supposed to at some point  marisha at some point yeah im sure  matt it all balances out it all comes out in the wash that divine man thats such a cool ability  marisha man thats funny  liam that was exhilarating  ashley 
none	 gosh that was down to the end  taliesin ive got to think up better ways to kill you  liam im surprised no one went into the lava until the very very end too  taliesin i had plans but you scared everybody into the corners the minute you vanished it just  changed everything the minute anybody had walked in front of that i had a tenfoot push  liam i feel like i would have lost momentum right away if i hadnt gone into stealth  marisha had i saved my next move was going to be 
none	 a thunder blast to try and push you into the lava  ashley i would have been donezo  marisha it came very close  ashley good job  all good game  matt but be aware that she still had death ward so even if you did hit her with that  marisha she would have had to come back back up with one hit point and then would have done it again  matt done something else yes either way that was an epic end man cleric victory both battle  royales weve had  marisha cleric victory 
none	 clerics are badass in general  matt yeah everyone out there is like eh i dont want to play a cleric  taliesin clerics two rounds now  ashley because you can heal yourself  matt yeah that saved you staying off to the side and healing yourself with your bonus actions  and stuff when no one was around  ashley yeah i was like ill just build up and then  matt hey man thats what saved you  liam it got so dirty at the end so dirty and nasty  marisha you guys did a lot 
none	 of damage to my stone form up front but someone almost brought me down  i was at six hit points and i stayed at six hit points for a long time  taliesin i know i was about to that was when my gun broke i was about to get you to drop and  then the gun broke  marisha yeah you were about to drop me i ended up dropping it myself because at this point it was  turning into a mexican standoff and i couldnt do anything and i cant cast spells when im in 
none	 an  earth elemental form  matt yeah well done guys  liam my time was up even if the blight hadnt gotten me without haste i was going to start  getting seen more often and i was low and you guys had plenty of frigging spells left at that  point i wouldve been toast  marisha i was just running out of options  matt you guys were down to the wire as far as spell options  marisha i was down to the wire because i burned 7thlevel on firestorm 6thlevel on sunbeam  which only 
none	 did half damage on him once so that wasnt great i still had a 5thlevel spell left  and one 4thlevel i burned through all my 3rdlevels  liam one day you guys will get the whole group  matt one day all of vox machina  marisha and itll be an eighthour fight  ashley yeah that would be the longest fight ever  matt no you have to understand you guys had a lot of standaway characters in this throwing  grog in the mix changes everything very quickly he can move quickly and tear your face off 
none	  quickly and having vex over there who does a shitton of damage from a distance and sam of  course being sam having all of you guys in one arena fighting im looking forward to it its  going to be a real crazy fight when it happens  marisha sam would be tough to square off against hed be another one to get me down to the wire  matt and hes got war caster so he gets advantage on his concentration checks too  marisha its tough too because a lot of it comes down to order 
none	 after a while it comes down  to turn order  ashley shit i always forget that i have advantages on charisma saving throws advantage on  all intelligence wisdom and charisma saving throws  taliesin i know that your strength is artificially increased does that artificially  increase your skill sets too so actually technically your athletics should be four  ashley oh shit so i probably would have rolled a little higher on some of these  matt its fine you still succeeded  marisha it all balances out  matt everyones saying happy birthday liam and laura 
none	  all happy birthday  matt yeah theyre all wishing you happy birthday  liam thank you  marisha if i hear one more read your spells people i am going to murder somebody no more no  more read your spells or read your sheets theres a lot to keep track of this is my binder look at  all this  taliesin you dont have other stuff to deal with either  marisha yeah its not like i have three fulltime jobs  matt nah its all good well guys thank you so much for watching i hope
