none	 sam taliesin i feel like most of the time you dont know what youre going to be talking about  taliesin thats true  sam so maybe you should just have a goto like its going to be daredevil again or something  just something  taliesin what are we going to yeah we need a goto what was going to be our blanket goto  im not sure  travis punisher  marisha great lakes avengers  taliesin great lakes avengers is actually pretty spectacular its hard to say it  great lakes avengers  matt make a big 
none	 effort to bring back the what the comics  liam what about the scientology graphic novels  taliesin i havent read those do they have those  liam well im up to level six  laughter  taliesin do you want to be a guest on the show  matt youve almost learned invisibility anyway apologies to all our scientology fans  sam yeah we just lost half the audience  matt all right so  liam sea org uniforms watching a giantscreen tv of critical role  laughter  matt exactly and signal boost  marisha jeff lewis we 
none	 announced it on tuesday on talks yeah jeff lewis still jeff  matt all right cool then unless we have anything else to announce lets get into  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back so getting us up to speed as to what happened last time vox machina had  recently been visited by an old ally scanlan shorthalt who had spent the past year or so  laura an old ally  matt yeah hey building a reputation and a criminal ring in ankharel as a forging master in  various types of 
none	 furniture and accoutrements and upon realizing through the aid of one his hired help  lionel or chud chad chod whatever the various pronunciations were that came through discovered  that there was a second sphere apparently on some sort of pyramidlike ziggurat structure not far  from ankharel upon you returning as scanlan to notify the party you all made your way to  ankharel briefly met with kaylie and saw a little bit of the setup that theyve been building  for the past year or so and then made your way towards the smouldercrown mountains to the 
none	  southeast of ankharel where apparently this structure resides and this cult that is apparently  sacrificing objects of magical power towards this black sphere so you made your way to the  outskirts of this mountain discovered that the entrance that was previously there had been  collapsed and discovered a new carved entrance into the mountain were beset by a few traps made  your way into a far corner set up a mansion and after dealing rather briskly with a cluster of  undead that had built up on the outside of your entryway to your magnificent 
none	 mansion you made  your way to the final chamber where the structure was residing a number of cultists there were in  the process of quickly hastily throwing these objects to the top and then noticed that you had  come as interlopers into this space at which point you realized the head of cult at least this  group here at the top of the pyramid was none other seemingly than lady delilah briarwood  all no no no  matt who then protected herself and two of her cult members beneath the veil of a prismatic wall 
none	  in the shape of a sphere and you did battle with a number of undead and other cultists and  followers of the whispered one that involved largely just throwing a bunch of them into the  ceiling including yourselves thanks to a wellplaced reverse gravity scanlan had darted  past the prismatic wall with a clever use of dimension door  sam shouldve died  matt actually no looking at the rules too it was a good call to bring it back in my opinion  but nevertheless they escaped seemingly into the sphere delilah and two of 
none	 these cultists after  turning it from this glowing white back into its black magicabsorbing self leaving you all there  managed to cleanse pike of her feeblemind spell and after acquiring a few of these magical  artifacts that were left unbroken and some cult robes and apparently symbols of this cult of the  whispered one you now stand in the middle of this cavern on the outside of where this second  ziggurat exists deciding what to do next and what the next step of this journey means for you  so vox machina what would you 
none	 like to do  laura what should we do next what does the next step on this journey mean for us  liam im getting wicked dejavu brah  marisha that was so existential of you vex wow  laura no but really what should we fucking do should we go through it  marisha that was a really meaty spell she had ive never seen that before  ashley thank you keyleth for bringing me back  sam i dont know how much time has passed since the fight but  can taryon cast revivify on doty still  
none	 matt no that much time has passed unfortunately  laura dotys gone again  travis did you lose a second one  sam i came back to get him  travis hes like iphones they just come out every so often  taliesin the doty 6 is going to have a much better camera its going to have better voice  recognition youre really going to be happy with it  matt you could use the same funds to bring that doty back it would just take you the week in  reconstruction anyway but youre not losing that doty 
dung	 the other one you unfortunately lost in the  city of dis but this can be brought back at the same cost of a new one so youre not having to  reconstruct an entirely new doty  marisha recycling  matt yeah  sam but i have to get his body somewhere  matt yes you do  sam great  taliesin i kind of want to collapse this cave  travis with us in it  taliesin no not with us in it i dont think we can destroy the ziggurat but i think we can at  
none	 least make it extremely difficult to find and get to and make it very uncomfortable for anything  that tries to come through  laura thats true that would be smart  sam but then we cant come through  laura we have another entrance we have the one in whitestone  liam also though this is an exit do you want the only exit to be in your basement the only  one or are there more of these places  sam also does each portal go to the same place or do they go to different parts  
none	 taliesin we saw the spire in both images correct  matt with the brief glance through the well the arrow was in the one beneath whitestone  through your connecting with sarenrae the vision that you received through that portal seemed to be  very similar to what vex described seeing through her arrow  laura it could be the same portal or they could both be within view of the tower  taliesin im imagining a circle of spheres  marisha and both seem to suck magic in correct  laura yeah they do the same thing  taliesin 
none	 i think well have an easier time keeping track of what is coming in and out if we  just have one to deal with as opposed to two  laura thats assuming theres only two  travis is it a stupid idea to shoot another oracle arrow through this one  and see if it looks the same  taliesin i dont know if we have the option  laura i can try but in whitestone there was at least a visual path toward the ball but i dont  think there is one here is there  matt 
none	 not within the radius  laura not within the magic orb  marisha its too tight a room  liam i think i like your idea but i worry that were upping the odds of listen we just found  out that shes alive or something shes going to unleash some sort of fresh hell somewhere were  upping the odds of it happening under your living room  taliesin i know its just what if it happens in both places at once  laura what if we collapse the one in whitestone  taliesin its directly under the castle 
dung	 we would have to maybe fill it with i dont know submerge  it or some such  laura at least try to block off the entrance to where they cant get out  marisha is there an underground water source near whitestone  taliesin theres acid pits  marisha we could try and flood it with acid  ashley what if we blocked off that entrance when we go inside  taliesin lets at least make sure this cave is collapsed well leave the chamber standing but  every entrance to this cave should be collapsed we know theres 
none	 three of them  laura what if we block this one and then we block the one in whitestone and then we just  sam game over  laura i think we win then right  taliesin well be able to get back in if we need to we just want to make sure that no one can  wander in and out of here without making a bit of a ruckus  laura so there are three entrances that we know of and we need to block all of them  taliesin ones already blocked  sam and one 
none	 do we know where it is  laura theres one up top that we heard about  liam how much time do i have left on my wings a lot probably like a half hour or 40 minutes it  wasnt that long  matt well no actually because when you used your wings outside you guys came inside did you  use your wings during the battle  liam yeah i did  matt did you guys take a long rest  taliesin we did because we had the mansion  matt you did so by this conversation happening 
none	 the rummaging through the bodies inspecting the  vicinity id say you maybe have 20 more minutes on your wings  laura oh yeah did we rummage through the bodies lets rummage through those bodies  matt you did thats how you found the objects  marisha while they rummage keyleth wants to test the radius  sam no we found the objects on that cart  matt thats right you found them on the cart you did not actually rummage through the bodies  laura is there anything on the bodies  matt make an investigation check  laura 
dung	 whoa that was high 23  matt 23 okay over the next 15 or so minutes as you go through and begin to gather the corpses  most of the skeletons out here that have armor on its old rusted destroyed broken armor and the  weapons either fell apart in the battle against you or are just barely usable or functional at  this point in time of the various cultists bodies the armor on the black guard that you were  battling is a pretty nicelooking set of full plate you also find similar symbols these dark  
none	 iron necklaces that you found on the previous cultists  laura well take those we can take the plate armor if theres room for it in the bag and then  see if its actually magical outside of the field  taliesin how many of those necklaces have we found  matt six  taliesin six necklaces  laura all right and we already had two so now all of us have one  travis i can make room in the bag of holding for the armor but i have to get rid of one of these  two bodies 
none	 does anybody object if i throw one of the bodies at the little black marble  liam i would kind of like to see that  taliesin actually i think thats a pretty good idea but you have to remove it from the bag  before you walk over to the marble  travis i have to what  taliesin you have to remove the body from the bag before you walk over  travis oh right okay so can i walk back to the fork  taliesin remove them both  travis back to the fork i pull out 
none	 both we only need one  taliesin all right  travis i pull one body out  laura he likes to save his bodies for later  travis listen ill run my store the way i run my store i pull one body out  matt which just as a note the visual of grog pulling this body out of the bag of holding is  much like trying to pull a slim jim out of the wrapper it pulls weird and you have to yank  travis what an analogy the sausage without the casing  matt yeah its 
none	 like by sections and you watch him strain as you pull some out and it folds over  its just really awkward and awful but yeah you manage to get the body out  travis close the bag of holding and i just drag him back over  matt impacts up each step  travis everybody ready and a one and a two and a whoosh  matt as you throw it it impacts and you watch as the body stops in midair from the gravity  stopping where it stands its legs fold over and like a broken physics 
none	 engine you watch as the  body crackling twists cracks and gets sucked in  laura lets not do that lets not go through that hole  travis it really doesnt seem that bad  taliesin i kind of want to experiment would you mind losing one of the necklaces or no  laura we can try  taliesin lets put a necklace on the other cadaver and then throw it through  travis i literally just walked all the way over there and now you want me to go back  taliesin you need the cardio lets not pretend 
none	 you dont were going to put one of the necklaces  on the body and throw it through itll still be fun to watch  travis i walk back out of the realm of the thing pinching my belly fat because apparently percy  thinks im a couple pounds heavy  laura its all that ale grog  taliesin i can only mock you on graph paper i take what i can fucking get man  travis ill pull the other slim jim out of the bag  matt suction sound you place one of the various symbols around its 
none	 neck and then babe ruthstyle  lob it and you watch as it gets within a certain proximity the orb seems to shimmer and shift open  ever so slightly its similar to what you saw it opened to a mouthed gateway when delilah and the  other cultists walked through the body still rattles and you watch it twist a bit but its a  far less impactful transition  laura all right so now we have seven of those things and we have to get eight of us through  taliesin one two three four five six seven 
none	 eight yes somebody will have to stay behind but  well figure that out if we go that direction theres other options  sam whos the eighth  taliesin you  laura you and you bitch  sam i live in ankharel and im a crime boss  laura yeah and youre here with us now  ashley youre not planning on going with us  sam i hadnt been invited  laura scanlan  travis that was pretty i mean from a third party noninfluenced or partial perspective  flipping gravity was pretty cool  liam plus hes got 
none	 a lot of big words now you want to be around to see them in action  marisha technically i can flip gravity i dont know i felt like i should put it on the table  sam oh okay see you dont really need me after all  marisha no thats not what i meant i just wanted to be honest  laura i havent seen you do it  marisha well it hasnt been relevant yet  liam youre also really clever forget your spells and funny and its good to have you  around so yeah do 
none	 you want to go someplace really horrible with your family or what  sam all right are you all offering  travis i dont know pike can he earn his way back in in this manner  ashley well i do think we could use the help  sam the help okay thats good enough for me im in will fancy boy be joining us  ashley are you jealous of him  sam no hes part of the team  ashley he is part of the team  laura tary what do you think  sam shit this again 
none	  liam tary its up to you but you were talking about going back  sam im sorry i was busy caring for my deceased robot  laura is doty  sam no hes fine hell be fine i just have to rebuild him itll take some time and money which  i dont have  ashley i wish i could help tary but i think thats out of my  taliesin we can get him back to whitestone hell be perfectly fine  we have everything we need there  sam all right i need him for the brigade 
none	  taliesin of course  laura the brigade right  sam yes but i cant carry him grog would you be able to  matt i can carry him and you look over and chod goes over and grabs doty grunt should i  put him somewhere  sam not yet chod wait until we get somewhere where i can work on it  matt okay  taliesin i say we head back to whitestone we gather resources we figure out how were getting  where were going to get  marisha we could theoretically forge more of these right 
none	 or do you think theyre blessed  taliesin lets find out we now know they work  liam i wonder if we could take them to allura or to shaun  laura well have tary identify them maybe its something specific  marisha yeah are they magical tary are these magical  sam let me look  laura outside of the field  marisha outside of the field  matt they are magical its a mild enchantment its not extremely strong but it is very  specific and it is more of an attunement to a specific plane it has 
none	 something to do with  whoevers bearing it or whatevers wearing it is already partially crossed to a certain extent so  it limits the impact of the transition  sam okay i dont understand any of that but there you have it  laura do you have any more identify left  sam sure  laura can we have you identify the plate armor that the big guy was wearing so we can see if  its magical  sam i do that  matt very well so this is plate armor of resistance to radiant  laura so 
none	 its immune to pike  taliesin its antipike armor  marisha well that kind of clues us in on a lot actually  sam chod cant use that can he  matt do you ask this question of him  sam chod can you use this  matt can i have it  sam i mean do we need it  ashley well  sam do we need it  taliesin yes lets not  sam do we need it  taliesin yes  travis radiant means all gods or just good gods  laura just good gods i think 
none	  taliesin i would like to put somebody in this armor in whitestone so that whoever comes through  the portal the first thing they see is something that they feel comfortable and familiar with  matt those boots are better than my boots can i have the boots  taliesin yes well what kind of boots are they  matt its full armor plate theyre still part of the armor set  taliesin we can get you something else nice i have a plan for this armor  laura i have so many things wait hold on chod theres 
none	 oh chod do you want a jewelry box that  makes music  ashley no you cant give him that jewelry box  matt he leans over to scanlan hey boss do i want a jewelry box  sam yes just say yes  matt yes i would love a jewelry box thank you  laura do you it makes music you like music  matt it makes music do i want it  sam when a girl offers you something you just say yes  matt yes please take all of it now hes carrying the music box and 
none	 doty  laughter  laura ill mark that off  liam lionel i have the perfect thing for you and i pull out the metal skullcap  matt thats loud  laura wait wait is that the clarota one  liam no thats the lionel gayheart one people will have a harder time  fucking with you in general  laura that is the clarota one wasnt it youre giving the clarota thing  the resistancetomind stuff  liam yes i am  laura because we could maybe use that  travis yeah theres still an idiot in this group 
none	  laura yeah theres maybe a grog in the group that could totally use it  liam ive had this hat for years  laura i know so maybe you should remember that you have it and give it to fucking grog  liam ive known that ive had it and ive talked to him about it no ones ever asked about it youve  never asked about it  laura i didnt know you had it  liam you are a hoarder you are many good things  laura no im just saying if grog has resistance to mind 
none	 control then that would be really good  for us in a fight with somebody thats really powerfully  liam grog this skullcap that lionel is wearing requires attunement would you like to give up one  of your really lethal weapons  travis no didnt we talk about this  laura i didnt know it required attunement  taliesin sense of dignity perhaps  travis ooh hey is he heavy dont you have your own bag of holding  matt no  travis oh  laura not everybody has a bag of holding grog  travis ill just give 
dung	 him mine  laughter  laura we just give him everything  taliesin we would turn on you so fast lets get back to whitestone  laura okay okay okay how do we collapse these tunnels  matt you guys can keep putting things on me thats fine  taliesin well we have thankfully a professional tunnel collapser  laura well thats true  travis yep oh me  taliesin so lets find the upstairs entrance and get rid of that  laura ill do that from outside  marisha i was trying to test the radius of this sphere 
none	 too am i still doing that  is that still relevant  taliesin well its worth noting just in case we cannot find the opening  matt it comes to about 180 feet from the actual sphere  marisha wow thats a long way its the same as the other one  matt its similar from when you originally tested it it was about the width of the whole chamber  underneath whitestone and that chamber was more cleared out more of the actual structure was  visible this one is still partially buried and youre only seeing the upper 
none	 half of it  marisha okay  liam do i even have the ability to fly in here is there an outer edge where the magic is not  matt in that chamber you cannot fly  liam cannot okay  laura and i feel like were going to run into traps if we try to find it from this way maybe  find it from the outside and just collapse it  taliesin all right  laura that way we dont have to go through a series of shit  taliesin lets doublereinforce just piledrive the one thats already 
none	 a little collapsed and make  it really collapsed and then well collapse the others while were leaving  laura yeah  travis happy grunts is that permission  taliesin that is more than permission that is permission and an audience were very excited  travis thats amazing ill go for it and ill whack on a wall do i just hit a wall anywhere  laura just in the tunnels maybe  sam wait youre an engineer arent you  taliesin yes no were going to be pointing at the things that need to collapse  travis okay im 
none	 ready any time  laura do you want to go up and see if we can find the thing up top  marisha yeah sure you guys have fun collapsing  laura its daytime now right outside  matt at this time it would be yes  laura so can me and keyleth go try to find the entrance up top so  we can do something to that one  matt sure okay  travis or should we wait til we collapse the tunnels  taliesin well they can find theirs while we get our tunnels collapsed  travis 
none	 yeah im sure it wont fall on me no big deal  ashley im going to help im going to help you  travis yeah  ashley yeah  marisha if it falls on you we can fish you out just survive a little bit  ashley keyleths got our back shell burrow in and pull us out  laura just earring us if something happens  marisha badger badgers burrow right do badgers burrow  liam they do burrow  travis thats why i said stay but thats all right  matt laughs all righty so you guys all 
none	 make your way back to the second entrance the hidden  illusory one you all back out of it leaving just pike and grog on the inside  taliesin and were helping them figure out where to punch to make everything  matt okay cool so i need you to go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin all right  matt and you can assist him which gives him advantage  sam ah i will assist you  taliesin thank you oh yes thats excellent its a 19  laughter  matt total of 19 okay halfway through 
none	 the hallway you find the place where the initial  collapse was started or you start looking to see what they used to destroy the first entrance that  you were supposed to come through you can see the way its carved designed especially the smooth  entrance which now that you get a better look at it that soft spongy ground that dust you were  finding you begin to recognize the pattern of what carved its way in you saw it used at the top  of the emberhold when you were fighting the queen there it was 
none	 a series of disintegration rays used  to carve away into this mountain thats what that dust is thats on the ground and why its such a  smooth entrance on this side  marisha but i rolled so shitty on that nature check before right  matt mmhm however because it was just a series of magic disintegrations pushed through to create  this second opening its a little harder to find points in the structure where the weakness is so  you begin to cut away at some areas you get like a small axe or one of 
none	 the various objects that  youve pointed objects that youve acquired over the  travis i do have just a regular pickaxe  matt yeah and you just hit at some areas and you do find one section where you would think it  would be a relatively weak point of impact between the various rocks and stones that hold this up  taliesin hit this and stand on this side of it and that should do some intense damage  matt you would recommend hitting it and then running  taliesin and run in this direction  laughter  
none	 travis okay pike  ashley yeah  travis i want you to warm up this spot for me and then youre going to jump on my back and then  im going to hit it  ashley okay i jump on your back now  travis no no you hit it  ashley like a backpack  travis yeah and then you can come up on my back  ashley oh i hit it  liam do we jump on three or is it one two three go  matt pike go ahead and make a strength check as grog 
none	 throws you up to the ceiling to where the one  place in the rock structure is  ashley yeah boi  travis ready to run just in case she just goes beast mode  marisha we should make little pike backpacks  laura oh my gosh how cute would that be  sam with like ashleys face right here  laughter  ashley no guys that doesnt need to be anywhere  liam well just repurpose those yoda bags  ashley 13  matt 13 okay so you take her and you alleyoop and you impact hit it and 
none	 you watch it  cracking and some dust falls and settles a couple of small pebbles falling pebbles and you  grab her like oh okay seems okay for now  travis all right get on yoda  ashley i try to wrap my legs around but they dont go  travis i rage first  marisha just her but with like a jockey on a horse straining  matt okay so it just happens naturally so go ahead and roll a strength check with advantage  marisha those gnomish thighs  travis 23  matt 23 so for the 
none	 height of the cavern here you get yourself a nice you crouch low and full  shoryukenstyle like impact punch into the roof and as you hit it impact and go clean through and  bring it to the ground land and you hear the crumbling  taliesin all right run  matt you guys start bolting through and as youre rushing pike youre looking over and you  can see the walls impacts you guys are bolting out as well both of you guys go ahead and make  dexterity saving throws please  travis i forgot we had 
none	 to roll for this part  ashley me too  travis i got advantage  laura oh god dont drop pikeys  travis oh thats good  ashley okay okay 16  travis 20 no 18  matt okay so as you guys are bolting youre holding onto grog and you manage to look behind  just fast enough to see one of the walls is about to fullon collapse at the side and you go  ahead and grab the side of grogs ear and yank his vision that way  travis groan  ashley just going to start 
none	 kicking him in the side  matt he starts turning off to that side and you manage to just avoid that side of the wall as it  impact  sam gif it gif it  laughter  matt so you start steering him from behind like a prized racehorse and making your way through this  cavern until eventually the back half of the cavern collapses and comes to a rest the front  half is not collapsing but you do you have a large portion of the path leading to the ziggurat  is now just rubble and 
none	 rocks  ashley okay okay okay good job  travis nice job  taliesin well done well done  ashley were getting somewhere but we still need theres still more to do  laura yeah theres that whole other path theres that whole theres that whole other path and  then the one up top  ashley okay  laura but i could hear a rumble so i know you guys did good on one of those paths already  ashley thanks we did pretty good  matt okay the rest of it is fairly easy to do because you 
none	 find the closer you get to the  entrance based on the previous collapsing elements of it have started to show cracks like  the actual weight because it was just a smooth transition there there was no loadbearing  platforms or any sort of general structure to the interior of this cavern so you guys manage to  pummel your way out a large spinning punch on this side and this side as youre rushing out and  as you do impacts you hear it slamming and hitting the ground behind you until you guys  emerge through it 
none	 looks like youre running straight at a wall because the illusory wall is  still there but you both just out the other side immediate hot daylight hits you the blaring sun  of the marquet sky clear blue sky no clouds youre now surrounded by a series of browned and  leafless trees with these large canopies that have the same pearlike  fruit hanging from the branches  travis fruit fruit  matt looks like fruit  travis are you hungry  ashley im hungry  travis hold on i hold up pike to go grab some fruit 
none	  ashley well check it  travis dont worry its just fruit  matt make a nature check  liam she can cure us of poison  taliesin not if shes busy dying from both ends  laura retching the spins  ashley six  matt its hard to tell but it looks really tasty  travis yeah i got great nature skills five  matt so looks tasty  ashley you know what grog  travis what  ashley as hungry as i am i think we should wait to have keyleth look at this fruit  travis why 
dung	 its just fruit  ashley because its outside of this cave and what if its a distraction like oh lookit  and you eat it and you just die  travis you know ive found if fruit when it goes bad falls from the tree and its still on  it therefore  ashley and when fruit goes bad it turns into wine  travis you get crunk drunk  ashley i think im going to wait for keyleth  travis im going to have a bite  matt okay you take a bite and its got a fairly moist 
none	 center you can see now like a cactus the  fruits here most of the moisture is retained within these fruit elements the flavor its not  sweet its quite pungent actually it has a bitterness to it its like putting your tongue in  a bunch of lye  ashley does it taste good  travis disgusted noises  ashley maybe make some mayonnaise or something want some mayonnaise to cleanse your palate  travis i take out the jug and i go honey hey  ashley oh all right  laura just a couple of sticky warriors  
none	 ashley no grog  matt just as a breeze blows a bit of a dust cloud through which coats your sticky hands with heavy  desert sand you chew for a minute and feel the crunch of granules inside your mouth where you  inhaled crunching  travis jug goes away  matt back to you guys you were looking for the other entrance  laura yeah up top  matt investigation check  laura both of us are looking for it were flying up can you fly so we can fly up i was going to  help you 
none	 look for it because i figure you have a better ability to collapse it than i do  liam what form are you going to take  laura a goldfish  marisha you could hold me in your hands ive got about 30 seconds just to fly up can i ride  sidesaddle with you  laura of course you can yes put your arms around me keyleth  marisha okay your abs are nice vex  laura i know i work out a lot  marisha have you been working out over the past year wow  matt so 
none	 whos helming the investigation of this and youre aiding her so go ahead and take it  with advantage  laura same thing 21  matt all righty i left on my collapsing music  travis they die  matt so as you glance around and do a pass over the next 20 minutes or so its as fast as you  can but it takes you a while to scan and get a feel for it you do see what looks to be because  you felt the wind was coming through from the interior you see a small 
dung	 welllike crevasse where  the rocks have collapsed inward you can see glancing over the top the dark five  sixfootwide hole that leads deeper into the mountain  laura i hover down near it but dont get off the broom  marisha i lean over i druidcraft a pebble toss it in the hole  matt dont hear it  laura oracle arrow down the hole  matt okay your vision watches as it  laura oh wait can she set the end of it on fire  marisha yeah  matt okay the arrow now burning it leads 
dung	 you into this dark space it lights up the interior  the arrow gets about maybe 60 feet before it hits a rock and shatters  laura aww  matt its not straight down it has a series of platforms and it looks like it was designed to be  climbed down so its a bit zigzaggy it maybe went 50 60 feet and it hits a platform and  shatters you lose your vision but it does appear to be a sizable tunnel used for entry  laura lets just fucking collapse it  marisha all right  laura 
none	 well just you fucking collapse because i cant do shit to this thing  marisha can i be like all right i want to see if i can do this like cool maneuver im going  to try to balance on the broom and then jump off the broom and go keyteor and go into the  laura into it into it or just around it so you collapse the  marisha nah  laura oh god keyleth  matt you watch as she leaps and cloud of dust there is no sign she impacted shes just gone  you 
none	 just see the side of the mountain  laura fuck fuck i get out the rope of entanglement and hover close to the surface and  start hanging the rope down  matt you glance in the inside with what little bit of daylight is ricocheting off of the stone  interior you can see the edges of keyleths elemental form swimming through the rock because  she can do that  laura thats fucking crazy  marisha its like whacamole  laura careful of traps though keyleth because im sure theres something in there  marisha all right  
none	 taliesin hows it going down there have you found it yet  laura up here  taliesin yes  laura fabulous our friend keyleth is amazing  taliesin she jumped in didnt she  laura yes she did  marisha im going to earth glide to the bottom and then peek my earthy face out of the top see  if i can see down  matt are you following the actual path  marisha yeah ill try to be conscious to make sure i dont hit anything that looks precarious  matt make an investigation check  laura dont 
none	 hit any traps  marisha all right looking for traps thats okay 15  matt 15 okay you get about a third of the way down and you realize that one of the platforms  that you can land on has uncharacteristically a softer cushion to it everything else is just  stone slabs this one has almost  sam waterbed  matt yeah laughs like a spring air mattress its crazy no its like a woven dried palm  frondlike cloth thats rested over it  sam im sure its nothing probably nothing just leave it  marisha just 
none	 a dropthrough can i like fuck  laura dont fuck with anything keyleth just collapse it  marisha i found like a it might be a roof or  travis yeah i bet clarotas in there  marisha what piranhas i dont know if piranhas are in rocks but there might be something else in  there there might be piranhas oh ill avoid it  matt okay you continue southward scooting you can sense the very exterior of the wall that leads  to this path so youre staying away from it as you glide through the rock and 
dung	 earth eventually  you come close to the very top breaching the dome that leads down into the chamber where you had  your battle naught but an hour ago as you poke your face through youre looking down you can  see the dark sphere there hovering you can see the large pyramid structure below it probably  about 60 feet below you you can see the entrance to the tunnel that leads into here there is a  small ladder up along the wall that previously you didnt notice because of the lack of light and  attention 
none	 to the ceiling portion but people were either climbing up into or climbing down from  laura what do you see keyleth  marisha theres a ladder man theres some very innovative people  yeah these are very innovative cultists  laura wait youre looking down at the ziggurat  marisha yeah hey pike and grog you guys did an excellent job  ashley and travis oh thanks  travis it really means a lot  laura get the fuck away from it keyleth  marisha okay good idea  matt by the way its fantastic you all hear through 
none	 it earth elemental grumbling  travis oh right yeah  matt the grumbling low voice of an earth elemental speaking to you through the earring  laura we still dont know how far that field goes  if you turn into keyleth again youre fucked  marisha unintelligible grumbling  laura get the fuck out  marisha i try and say like well i know its about 180 feet because i tested before so im  trying to be conscious of it and then i back up a little bit and i go over to where that tunnel  was 
none	 and i start collapsing it down as i work my way up im going impacts  matt easily enough you go by and you start kicking through the tunnel as you go you can  sense near proximity where any of the various weak points are in the stone systematically go through  it collapse it piece by piece until eventually most of the tunnel is useless and unusable  marisha its like a platformer  matt how long can you maintain your wild shape  marisha half of my level or something like that  matt oh youre fine 
none	 then  marisha or its a third of my level still several hours  matt you emerge a little over an hour or so of doing this you emerge from the top you watch as  keyleth rock impacts looking like a large version of fantastic fours thing  laura im holding my rope for her you dont okay  matt it appears to be taken care of all of the entrances have been collapsed theres no way that  you can imagine any average person can find their way into this  laura good job are you going to 
none	 stay that way or are you turning back into you so that i can get  you on the broom  marisha guttural noise of agreement  laughter  laura you can still talk right you just sound low  travis no  marisha guttural gibberish i speak a different language that i still dont think anyone has  matt you can you maintain your mental acuity and statistics when youre in there  marisha i dont know weve gone back and forth on it  taliesin it never occurred to you to speak common why would i do that 
none	  matt the texture and timbre of your voice you can hear words but its almost like words being  made by slamming rocks together  laura crazy  marisha not that different from my normal speech  liam i wont bore you with the details but while all that was going on while they were searching  and they were destroying things vax wandered a hundred feet out and sat down and did a little  talking to the mother of ravens and basically said not expecting an answer  this is it isnt it  matt make a 
none	 wisdom check  all ooh  liam not good 13  matt 13 thats enough as you sit there in silence with your eyes closed beseeching the  attention of your patron which seemingly wasnt present when you attempted to in the proximity of  this doorway the familiar soft omnipresent voice creeps into your psyche as she tells you it  seems that the bender of fate is feeling the tug of destiny its almost as if youre coming  towards me if you sense this path is the right one follow your instincts  perhaps well meet soon 
dung	 enough  liam i will see you soon  matt all right so you guys reconvene  laura hey guys hows it going  liam hey guys  laura what should we do  travis you should try the local fruit its delicious  ashley yeah you guys should try it  taliesin i pick up a piece of the local fruit and smell it  matt how do i describe the smell its reminiscent of discovering old lemon juice that  has grown sticky on a surface like a dark mahogany wood surface kind of like a bar floor 
none	  well go with that  taliesin no i dont think i will  travis it belies its true flavor  taliesin i dont think it does  marisha this looks like its rotten from the landscape it looks like its all gone bad  has it gone bad  matt make a nature check  travis oh great  marisha 25  matt no there are elements that have gone bad on the ground and have been covered by sand  as winds blow through  taliesin naturally awful  matt its like desert noni its extremely healthy and 
none	 has a lot of practical medicinal use  in fact its traded specifically for its use in various herb pouches  marisha does it have a name  matt yes  liam like that giant stinking flower grog took a bite of the giant stinking flower  matt a vafall fruit  marisha a what  taliesin did it alter grogs stats on any level  matt no  taliesin then its not that healthy is it its like agave  marisha vafall  matt listen to sam hes got the pronunciation  liam i will eat you with a 
none	 lovely chianti and some vafall  all vafall  ashley should we take some then  laura make some medicine  taliesin you could try to bake with it maybe its bakeable  marisha it makes a really good salve its good for sunburns  liam or shoving in somebodys bed  travis how do we get back to whitestone  taliesin is there a tree that this fruit was coming off of  matt yes  taliesin i point at the tree  matt the ones on the outskirts of the mountain range are small but the deeper into 
none	 the valleys  and ravines between the large spirelike mountains you do find a few that are probably  large enough to utilize through your spell  marisha yeah i can do that  laura tary are you coming back to whitestone  sam i have to yes i have to repair doty and also find some new recruits i think there are  some in whitestone right  taliesin youre really going through with this  sam of course its my destiny i met you all to become an adventurer and now im bringing my  knowledge back to 
none	 my people its like it was written in a book  laura a very good book  travis yeah youre writing a book  sam i am  ashley and not only that youre going to be the leader of a band of adventurers  travis are you a colonel a general a private  sam i hadnt thought of that you know what theres no leader of vox machina so maybe there  wont be in the darrington brigade well besides you youre unofficially  youre definitely the treasurer  liam im behind her doing this  travis yeah 
none	 rolling eyes  laura lionel  matt his mouth is filled with fruit  laughter  laura is it good how are you doing  matt its getting really heavy this is really heavy  laura yeah are you coming back to whitestone as well scanlan i mean aes is he coming back  sam i suppose well need him for now yes  laura okay  taliesin i still like the idea of perhaps the two of you working together you could talk to scanlan  about it and see if hed be all right  laughter  taliesin 
none	 im never going to get bored of this im never going to get bored of this  liam scanlan what do you think  travis that was a fucking awesome physical reaction  liam at least in the short term  sam youre suggesting that i scanlan shorthalt bequeath my employee chod to this gentleman here  you mean me taryon darrington you mean chod could join my brigade  well yes i guess thats what theyre talking about  well i dont see why not hes very capable and strong  yes and i wont have much use for 
none	 him for a while so if youd like to take him with your  brigade you can  well im not going to say no to a fellow member of vox machina now am i  no youre not  no im not  travis yes  matt i dont see any similarities  laughter  taliesin thats everything i wanted im good  laura through the tree then  marisha through the tree  matt all right so as you finish concentrating on the outside of one of these large 15 to  20foottall leafless fruitbearing trees in the 
dung	 center of the smoldercrown forest the doorway  shifts open revealing on the opposite side the dark sunless night of whitestone  marisha i pick a blossom from the tree on the way out  liam i pull two of the fruits  matt okay you guys arrive its early evening you can see the windows of nearby homes shops  and various structures near the square are beginning to glow from the interior light of small  lanterns and candles in the distance you can see the perimeter beacons being put along the castle  walls on the exterior 
none	 of castle whitestone youre back home  laura lets gather our troops  taliesin make thy way to the castle  laura find out what theyve learned  matt all right at which point lionel keeps asking  can i put him down yet can i put him down  sam not quite yet  taliesin were going to take him to the castle  sam change arms  matt ooh that helps a lot you make your way to the castle  dotys delivered to the workshop taryon  sam stays there  matt okay  laughter  taliesin 
none	 well keep you informed  sam thank you  matt all right so you guys now have the run of the castle what do you wish to do  laura we asked cassandra to gather people to study the shadowfell as soon as we did the oracle  arrow last time so it would probably be smart to find out what  theyve learned before we make our plans  matt okay as you approach cassandra at this hour she currently has a recently steeped  stillsteaming cup of tea resting on the table towards the window side the front 
none	 window side of  the general dining hall area of the castle where you usually eat your supper shes facing away  from the table and has a thick robe over her and has the tea and is in the process of reading  through books her hairs pulled up tightly and some of its a mess in front of her face shes  very much in work mode shes poring through books and as soon as you enter she reaches over  for her cup of tea oh hello everyone she gets herself a little more presentable ive got 
none	  the assistance of eskil ryndarien everyone else seems to be a bit busy at the moment but allura  is doing the best she can research on her end as well  taliesin were going to need everybody its worse than we could have imagined  laura and we have far less time than we would have imagined  matt how much time do we have  taliesin this has to be taken care of immediately  liam things are happening now  matt well you have far better means of acquiring these people than i do i can 
none	 merely  send missives and requests  taliesin were going to send word out im going to take out my flask and put it on the table sit  down for a moment  matt she takes it and adds it to her tea  laura is ryndarien here  matt he is hes currently inspecting the ziggurat again hes setting his notes up where he  previously set up research quarters during the incursion of the conclave  laura we need to get everyone away from it  marisha wheres allura  matt shes in emon shes still part 
town	 of the council there  taliesin we have to get her here immediately  liam is gilmore still in town  matt no hes back in emon  liam he left for good  laura im going to run down to the ziggurat and try to get eskil ryndarien away from it and warn  everyone to stay away from it  matt okay  taliesin lets doublecheck that armor for any weird influences it may have to make sure it is what  it seems to be which is ornamental with a bit of magic lets make sure that 
dung	 the captain of  whatever guard is on shift down by the ziggurat is wearing it and is aware that hes there to  befuddle the enemy  matt okay you make your way down there and you can see its still fairly dark in that chamber  most of the lights have been snuffed except for a few torches that are set around the central  platform that was built about midheight on the ziggurat where you guys had the council meeting  with raishan that one time and where most of the research is being done there up 
none	 top you see a  number of guards the pale guard are assigned to keep watch you see jecht the manservant of the  realmseer eskil there as well currently you see eskil ryndarien is spreading out his thick scrolls  and books and theyre all across the big central wooden table and he has his thick spectacles on  and he has a number of candles already set up and hes deep into getting his space prepped and  acquiring whatever information hed put away since the investigation was put on hold  laura eskil  matt yes oh 
none	 it has been some time lady vexahlia  ive heard youve come up in the world  laura oh yes im a lady now  matt wondrous yes what do i have the honor  laura well i hate to be the bearer of bad news but im afraid  being down here isnt safe anymore  matt right so you brought me all the way out here and now i cant do my work thats great  no thats par for the course its basically most of my life  laura plenty of work up top away from this 
none	 orb of death its very dangerous  matt oh youre right i didnt know that ive only spent six months with the thing  laura weve discovered its a gateway and things can come through it and there might be armies  coming through because we just fought somebody on the other side of another ziggurat  matt thats preposterous siphons only work one way my dear nothings coming through there  laura she changed it did you know that siphons can be changed  it changed from one color to another  matt you know this how  laura 
none	 because i was there to witness it  matt what here  laura in ankharel and it looks the exact same as this one  matt he looks you over really intensely if what you believe you saw is indeed another one of these  siphons then perhaps we should take a little more care  laura i agree  matt jecht please continue gather everything were taking this outside  laura fabulous youre so agreeable i do love talking to you  matt wonderful good to know goodbye they gather up the materials the pale guard escorts  them 
none	 back into the hallway and hes now talking to jecht off on the side he goes well then we  can go ahead and stage ourselves in the grand guestroom with the nice big bed yes  laura the big ornate bed  matt he looks over his shoulder as you say this oh youre eavesdropping now as well  thats wondrous  laura i have wonderful hearing  matt so i can tell yes the big bed the one that helps with my back  laura yes thats terrible can you look at this armor really fast and make 
none	 sure that its not  actually cursed or anything  matt looks fine to me keeps walking  laura was it cursed or anything when you looked at it  sam i dont know  matt did not appear to be cursed from your glance at it  laura would he have known from the identify spell if it was cursed great well  marisha can keyleth go talk to percy  taliesin im in cassandras room still  marisha keyleth waits for percy hang on i can go talk with cassandra as well  matt unless youre having a

none	 slowly curls back she stares off into the  distance clenching her fist very tightly  taliesin she escaped into the ziggurat so shes no longer on this plane of existence but some  form of her whether its undead or otherwise were going to need to put it down again  matt yes we do  taliesin i wanted you to hear it from me there will be no running this time  matt no running  taliesin not from me  matt but youll take care of her  taliesin this is the end of her i will 
none	 be there to see it  matt shes escaped death once already who knows how many times she has before  you have to end it  taliesin we will discover what she did  matt dont destroy her body destroy everything she is  taliesin if we cant kill her we will entrap her forever  matt shatter the soul whatever it takes end her brother  taliesin i know i shall  matt she takes the flask  taliesin i wanted you to hear it from me so you could compose yourself when  other people begin to 
none	 tell you  matt i need a moment alone please  taliesin theyre going to need us to be the strongest i have faith in you ill leave you to  it im so sorry  matt im going to be sick  taliesin yes im going to leave her to her room and shut the door  matt you close the door and there in the hallway waiting opposite the door is keyleth  taliesin hi  marisha how did that go  taliesin honestly better than i expected  marisha yeah  matt at which point you hear 
none	 behind the door a muffled retching  taliesin more sick and less things breaking id rather her be sick than angry  marisha you think i hate being sick anger at least drives you towards something  taliesin it does not drive de rolos towards anything good  marisha fair point i have a crazy thought and i needed to run by you sorry didnt mean to hit  you okay im excited all right we watched the orb change she changed the magic in the orb  right we just spent a year making magical orbs that change in 
none	 some way that are all linked to  our city clearly not as powerful as what this is  taliesin no not at all  marisha but what if i dont know what if she corrupted something that was already there that  wasnt supposed to be corrupted what if she can corrupt more things like our crisis orbs i had  this immediate fear that what if i built something that was supposed to help  taliesin im so glad you thought of me when this came up  marisha well you helped me build it am i crazy 
none	 for thinking it am i totally off base  taliesin i think were going to be walking a very fine line of paranoia for the next  however long  marisha maybe theres something in our own technology in our own magic that can help inform  us i dont know  taliesin when they get here were going to look at everything  marisha all right well sleep on it  taliesin i think were going to be fine but you did give me some ideas that  im going to think about  marisha and those symbols the 
none	 necklaces druids we use similar things  when we plane shift to other worlds  taliesin im going to take one to the library and inspect it im going to also see what any of our  other arcanists think of it if its from a cult that anybody has heard of before  marisha i think i can plane shift us there with it if we dont want to go through the orb  taliesin really  marisha i think it seems like very similar technology magic  taliesin im rubbing off on you  marisha yeah i dont 
none	 know sleep on it im going to go think  taliesin i have no idea what just happened yeah im going to doublecheck the orb room just for a  moment for my own paranoia  marisha the crisis orb room actually ill go with him  taliesin just to look and then im going to start researching that symbol im going to go to  the library and im showing the council everything  matt okay you speak with the rest of the standing chamber you begin to do your research  make a history check  marisha oh 
none	 thats good take it  taliesin 22  matt 22 youve read through most of the books here between you and jb whos spent some time  also reading quite a bit theres no mention of the symbol itself and theres very little  information on the whispered one on vecna its interesting theres almost a gap in history  there are subtle mentions of this figure this oncepowerful mage that had begun to look into the  secrets of life prolonging it the fabric of reality and then its just missing from history  and you recall all the 
none	 books that would cover that time period you remember hearing stories  from allura regarding the whispered one originally theres no mention  taliesin is it a physical omission from the books or is it even that the books that would  cover it are not here books that should cover it that dont  matt books that you feel like should cover it historical recalling of wildmount which if you  recall based on some of alluras discussion on the whispered ones previous existence as a  mortal largely vecnas work was done over on the wildmount side of 
none	 exandria  taliesin and theres no  marisha bitch sorry go on  taliesin i dont know whats happening over here  matt i dont either  taliesin theres nothing thats simple like the more im looking im looking for  mention of the symbols  matt no  taliesin keyleth you know damn well where i am right now im sitting in the library reading  books so if you have something to say oh wow youre going way back  marisha im looking ill meet you in the library  sam how to play pathfinder  laughter

none	 like a giant poke bowl  sam its not a salad with meat on it its a salad made of meat  liam thin slices  travis this is far greater than anything i could have hoped for  taliesin previously on hannibal  travis did you invent this just now  matt you look at the wait staff and they actually sir it was chef varon you look over  and you see this one and youve seen a couple of the chefs here you havent interfaced with them  too much youre not a social figure necessarily more 
none	 of a demanding figure when it comes to the  food and the meal but you see this gentleman with this thin john waters pencil mustache this  thinning hair thats short but slick with a bit of pattern baldness going on hes a bit thick  around the waist and hes sitting there with a big beaming grin of pride  travis chef this is going to put you on the map we need to name it  matt oh well grand poobah i image that would be your honor to give i am but humbled to present  
none	 you with such a meal so the choice is yours  travis what fine tender meats are in this dish  matt oh well weve got quite a variety i wanted to provide an extravagant walk through the  various creatures that we prepare here in whitestone would you like me to continue  travis please yes im talking to myself  matt we have twoweek salted goat meat on top of that we have hickorykept long anglesmoked  fish guts mixed in there with a wondrous mix of minced steaks weve spared no possible expense on  the various 
none	 pieces of the cow weve from that point forward presented a sprinkling of pork  belly thats been ground up and saltcured as well over the period of about two months usually kept  to our various steam meals but i thought this was a special occasion  travis im just freedripping saliva in and on the plate  matt so it has a very sedimentary layers of the planettype feel to it where each reveal occurs  its a whole different genus of animal youre eating nature in a bowl  travis i mean did you even like salt 
none	 it or nothing its just all these beautiful animals in  my own private ark of a bowl  matt they came salted  travis well because its got goat fish beef and pork in it im going to call it the gofibepo  matt gofibepo it is  travis but like you seem to have an accent so lets put a little flair on it when you say it  the bowl of gofibepo  matt gofibepo  travis i like it  matt of course grand poobah  travis and i must decree there will be no utensils 
none	 used when you dine of this sublime dish  matt he begins writing these things down all right all right you would need approval from  lady cassandra of course to put this in the familial  travis approval  matt well if you were to make this the official meal of whitestone that is entirely within  travis this just gets better and better submit whatever paperwork is necessary  see that its done  laughter  matt you heard him folks grand poobah has spoken  travis gofibepo  matt gofibepo  travis even better and ill just 
none	 start handsmashing into my face this  delicious salted meat collection  laura im hungry now  matt yeah oh it is delightful it is delicious  travis you should not be able to make up food that delicious just on the fly like that i  literally felt like i was at a fucking restaurant that was absurd  laura i want to eat it  taliesin as i was saying grand poobah i knew it was going to bite me in the ass  i dont know how  travis meat salad youre welcome  taliesin it actually

none	 marisha okay oh my gosh oh okay oh praise sarenrae theres so much going on okay remember  how whitestone used to be all dead and awful very similar to how the other ziggurat was dead  taliesin yes of course  marisha and then they called the ziggurat the seat of pelor right so what if it was already  there what if shes taking doorways and dimensions and corrupting them  and bastardizing them and  laura if shes done that if she did that to the sun tree how old is delilah briarwood  taliesin well we 
none	 dont  matt the sun tree has been around since before  taliesin the sun tree was here before the castle was here but and things have always happened  here the city has a history of strange occurrences im inclined to believe there was  something well there was obviously something beneath the castle before she got here or else  she wouldnt have come here to begin with  laura it was a temple to ioun  matt the history you know is back in the age of arcanum this valley housed a temple to ioun  which 
none	 was corrupted and in the calamity the battle between the gods and mortals that changed  the epoch the knowing mistress suffered a grievous wound from tharizdun the chained  oblivion and in that battle pelor the dawn father delivered enough of a blow to the chained  oblivion to defeat it and aid in locking it away with the temple still lost beneath this valley  that was when the sun tree seed was planted by pelor to be guardian over this space  marisha what was he locking away  matt a god called the chained oblivion  
none	 marisha the chain oblivion  matt the chained oblivion tharizdun yeah a mad god of chaos and destruction  liam totally awesome metal band  travis yeah great name  marisha okay well thats a big deal  taliesin and i mean i think its safe to assume that thats whats down there and thats what they  were looking for when they came here in the first place  laura right  marisha and delilah came from wildmount  taliesin yes she was also i mean  marisha you did a bunch of research on vecna he used to 
none	 be a man right  taliesin and laura yes  laura he wanted to become the prince of the undead right am i saying that right no no no  matt from what youve come to understand and the research youve done since the name has come up  taliesin im pulling out my notes  liam we spent a year reading books  matt right now mind you the information is still very hard to find  laura because hes the god of secrets  matt hes not a god wants to be or at least wants to and 
none	 there is some obsession with the  ascension of a mortal to a beyondmortal state which has only been achieved by one being before  marisha i mean it sounds a lot like what delilah is going for  laura what if she is vecna  marisha what if she is vecna  taliesin well or she wants to become the next vecna  marisha yeah dread pirate roberts of the vecna she came from wildmount where vecna originated  she came here for research  laura shes just finishing what he started  marisha maybe shes just finishing what 
none	 he started and wasnt she doing a bunch of research  for runes and tomes do we have the research that the briarwoods  didnt we seize a bunch of their research  taliesin we got some of it but they burned a lot  matt you got some of it and a lot of it dealt with ley energies there are certain lines that  stretch across invisible lines that stretch across exandria where the magical powers that  hold together the planes and protect it through the divine gate and other elements  marisha do any of those 
none	 ley lines go through where we were in marquet  matt you dont know that but you do know that whitestone resides right beneath a nexus these  ley lines were shifted during the calamity and now one of these nexuses is right over whitestone  which is why this location was chosen for the ritual that the briarwoods were assembling  marisha i wonder if each ziggurat is over a nexus  taliesin it could be we know that shes not  ancient because we have a bit of a paper  trail we do know that she was 
none	 ruling in wildmount for a while we do know that she studied at the  alabaster lyceum briefly and theres some paperwork for that  matt in looking up the background history you would know that king bertrand dwendal of the  dwendalian empire was given information in regards to the briarwoods who were essentially accused of  forbidden necromancy and were to be arrested and put on trial and thats when they fled westward  towards taldorei and then encountered your family  taliesin yeah  laura so they got run out of wildmount  matt seemingly  taliesin 
none	 from what we understand and again theres not much that survived that they tend to  cover their tracks  marisha they were also trying to build that whole bridge situation remember the bridge  that was weird  taliesin they wanted to move well  marisha they wanted to move an army right  matt the bridge from what you can tell there was no way plans or means of even building a  bridge and a bridge has been attempted in the past over the shearing channel and its just too  the cliffs are too steep and 
none	 too windy and the water beneath is too strong which is why the  prospect to the previous sovereign was such a possible good thing to make a deal with the  briarwoods at the time but there are no plans nothing in their notes spoke of actually making a  bridge it was more a means to get into the graces of the royal family  taliesin and probably collect assets as well  marisha okay if you were run out of somewhere  taliesin which i have been  marisha which you have been after a lot of 
none	 research  taliesin which ive done  marisha  and you were trying to do something  taliesin which i do  marisha  what would be your second place of choosing to go  taliesin anywhere that they serve some sort of meat salad i imagine  laughter  marisha im just saying if youre run out of one place for doing something i imagine  taliesin youre thinking maybe they have another portal in wildmount  marisha yes i do  taliesin yes  laura another ziggurat  taliesin could be several of them  marisha if they 
none	 are run out of one place for something my first thing would be try to find the  next place to keep it going  laura right and then she got run out of here so she went to ankharel  marisha correct what if shes already been killed in wildmount so many theories you guys  so many theories its kind of exciting  taliesin lets not get overly speculative here  travis are ziggurats always pyramids  liam thats what a ziggurat is its like an aztec bipbipbip  marisha we know the briarwoods also did dealings with 
none	 the stormwinds in wildmount  laura what other pyramids have we seen though have we seen any other  travis the thing we fought the beholder in  laura the mindflayer place that was a ziggurat  marisha son of a bitch  laura under kraghammer oh my god is there a ziggurat in kraghammer  liam hell yeah there is a ziggurat yeah it was a ziggurat  matt youve seen a few actually  liam im speaking in my voice because im not there but he said yeah oh hes pokerfacing  it we said ziggurat many times 
none	 when we were down there  marisha did we see a pyramid when we were in wildmount when we went there  taliesin we were barely there though  laura but it wouldve been underground i mean who knows where the fuck it was wait wait wait  what about the temple where we saw the other sphinx was that another ziggurat there  marisha and that was up in vasselheim thank you  laura ah is there a ziggurat  marisha theres a ziggurat on every continent singing every continent has a ziggurat  laura they can come out 
none	 everywhere  travis so collapsing the tunnels didnt really do that much  taliesin no because it shut one potential vein of a dozen  marisha its these damn ley lines i knew theres been something up with these ley lines and i tried  to talk to the sun tree about it and he didnt know  laura well hes a tree  marisha hes a tree  taliesin be nice to the sun tree  marisha no hes very cool  travis so all the bodies that were hanging under whitestone right they were all stapled to the 
none	  walls was that the army was she trying to fill them with necromantic energy  taliesin oh my god they wouldve come alive if there had been a giant blast of necrotic energy  travis yeah the bodies werent feeding the thing she was trying to imbue them with  taliesin she was preparing to create an army  liam yeah and they were missing arms  laura we didnt look in the ziggurat in ankharel there couldve been bodies there too  taliesin i dont think they had gotten that far yet  marisha and one of the 
none	 things i have written down  travis why were they throwing magical things into it though it was magical items into  taliesin offerings because they wouldve become magical once they got to the other side of the  portal i mean they wouldve been great gifts  liam what do you think taryon darrington or scanlan  matt tary is fixing doty  sam im just giving him cpr  laughter  sam youve never given up on anything in your life now live  laughter  liam ed harris in the abyss youve never given up a day 
none	 in your life you bitch  ashley scanlan  sam im in my room praying  laura youre not here  marisha in your room praying  laura praying to sarenrae  sam mmhm or logic  laughter  taliesin logic is a fickle god  marisha yeah desmond mumbles briarwoods carriage driver  lady briarwood is immune to daylight  taliesin its like watching your game in fastforward  marisha briarwoods have an army i have it in giant big letters  but i dont know what that means  laura obviously it would take a very long time 
none	 to go to every ziggurat that weve seen and see if  theres an army inside of it if theyve been preparing things there over this past year that we  havent been doing anything  travis we dont know that any of this is right we should just go through  laura we should go to the shadowfell and fucking end this before  she sets out her armies everywhere  travis we did let her regroup a little bit but we didnt know what we were doing  taliesin there was nothing we could have done  travis 
none	 do you want to mess with the stones try and duplicate them we have seven right  laura we have seven we could go through  taliesin seven of us could go through  sam whispering were only seven people  laura theres only seven of us  taliesin theres eight one of us would have to stay behind  sam whos the eighth count the table friend  travis tarys staying  taliesin tarys the eighth are we going to go through with tary  im being such an asshole right now  matt youre terrible  marisha i 
none	 could also maybe plane shift us there with one of these  travis if we take damage going through the portal with the stone does that mean we might take  damage if you plane shift us there  laura who knows its the shadowfell  taliesin i say we speak with allura and if this looks  laura we need to talk to eskil ryndarien and see what he knows about the shadowfell right hes  been studying the shadowfell too  matt since he arrived yeah  taliesin i think the plan is we take the fight to 
none	 them  laura and travis yeah  marisha is it worth going back to any of the other ziggurats or no  laura i dont think so at this point  taliesin i think that its not time to check the doors its time to go out and chase the monsters  if we take care of them it doesnt matter how many ziggurats there are  travis yes  laura we just have to  taliesin hope we dont miss one travel the world  laura hey at least vecnas not a god bonus there  marisha thats true 
none	  taliesin lets have an evening and then tomorrow well  travis tallyho  taliesin collect what weve learned and if were prepared jump into a sphere of death  laura we cant waste time  marisha if we jump through the sphere of death they might be expecting us on the other side of  the sphere of death if we plane shift we might be able to come up with a  flanky secret other tactic  taliesin if you can figure out a way to use one of these to create a plane shift that youll feel 
none	  comfortable with then im all right with that  marisha ill talk it over with other magicusers first  travis which ones  marisha i dont know ill find one  liam we can go visit one of them im not there  matt youre not there  travis make the call  marisha eskil knows stuff like that  taliesin lets all get some sleep and in the morning were going to take care of this one way  or the other well take this fight to them  laura youll talk to eskil because i hate that

none	  laura go find eskil somebody else is going to go find out from him right  matt hes actually eating out in the garden he has one of the little tables set out there its a  nice morning out in whitestone right now its chilly but the clouds have broken a bit you can  see some blue skies a little bit of suns breaking through hes out there with jecht his  associate whos in the process of cutting his food for him while eskils sitting there still  looking through books and occasionally reaching over and 
none	 plucking things from his plate to eat as  you approach him he doesnt even look up he goes yes what do you require  marisha good morning  matt good morning to you as well i suppose  marisha lovely weather today isnt it  matt it is weather yes  marisha so hows the research on the shadowfell going  matt its done ive researched it i dont know what you require  marisha all of it all of the research  matt as much as is in the tomes i have at my disposal yes  marisha 
dung	 anything we should know anything important fill us in a little bit spark notes  matt its a plane of negative energy and elements of it are used to funnel the transition  of souls from life to death or back a number of it is scourged by undeath and those that skirt  that process it exists as a mirror plane much like the feywild there are elements that resemble  exandria but twisted shifted it is a very barren very broken dustfilled dark not a  very pleasant place really  liam and chockfull of undead you said 
none	  matt elements of it yes  marisha used to transport souls give me a second  liam sorry she carries this book around shes very precise with her notes  matt good you should be precision is recommended  marisha okay im going to show him the necklace that we found this seems to have a slight magical  attunement to the shadowfell do you think i could use this as a planeshifting device  matt it would need some alteration its possible very careful alteration you need it to  be a very narrow fork in order to 
none	 properly channel the spell and this does not quite match the  proper division of magical energies it could be physically altered to do so but too much and you  ruin the minor enchantment and attunement  marisha all right thats very good to know  liam but doable  marisha with how much time  matt i dont know im no metalworker i imagine not too much  marisha okay are you able to send messages you have sending yeah  matt he leans back looking slightly offended i have means to communicate with individuals of  importance 
none	 yes  marisha just wondering if you could tell my dad that i might be gone for a long time  matt i have absolutely no interest in any of what you just said  marisha id really owe you one eskil just a quick message  matt im not a messenger service for individuals parental units  liam well we are potentially going to throw ourselves at the greatest evil that this world has  ever known in the hopes that the entire world can survive so thats a big favor thats a big gimme  for you so 
none	 maybe in exchange for that you could send a little message  marisha just to my dad to let him know that i might die attempting to  matt whos your father  marisha korren of the ashari who is one of the headmasters  matt right of the wind people whatever right okay  liam who is your daddy and what does he do  laughter  matt he thinks for a second begins to run his finger in the air and you watch as theres a  faint scrolling of soft bluishwhite light poof turns to smoke and 
none	 vanishes all right he knows  youre going to be off doing stuff in the shadowfell and probably wont be back for a while  marisha thank you  matt youre welcome  marisha can we maybe borrow your research notes on the shadowfell is that a thing no sighs  matt thud  marisha thank you  liam seriously thank you  marisha thank you  matt youre welcome i will call into this favor later  marisha sure you know where to find us what  liam nothing  marisha all right enjoy your tea and biscuits

none	 you can tell everyone  that you sell to that you sold the things that saved the world to vox machina  matt make a persuasion check  laura it wasnt a one persuasion 19  matt vox machina you say you know these folks  laura lady vexahlia at your service  matt his eye widens on one side well ive not really seen or know much about you folks but ive  heard tales of you  laura i turn and show him the scales from the chroma conclave  matt that real dragon no shit well i

none	 12  matt make a tinkering check dexterity well no this would be intelligence  taliesin its intelligence  matt its a new concept youre trying  taliesin intelligence check  matt plus your proficiency  taliesin plus my proficiency thats 19  matt 19 sure you manage to make about 12 pieces of silver shot you know for the most part  because its not as hard as other forms its going to be  but it is susceptible to enchantment  taliesin which is why i was going to then take those to pike i dont entirely understand 
none	 how  this works but i had an idea and i show her the 12 silver bearings basically would you know how  to bless something like this  ashley i could certainly try  taliesin i think this might come in handy its a wild idea i dont know im trying to think of  surprising her with something  ashley i think thats actually a fantastic idea  taliesin theyre a bit hard to make and they may just not be useful at all but i thought i  dont know how any of this works  ashley

none	 right goodbye ill see you soon little elf girl  laura bye goldie fakecries  matt all right so what do you wish to do guys  ashley is there a way that i can bless these bullets  taliesin theyre musket balls technically theyre not bullets  matt it will take you a while to do so you could temporarily bless them with the bless spell but  to infuse them with the blessing would be the equivalent of a small enchantment so it would  take you a couple of days or something  ashley well i could 
none	 start it depending on when we leave i guess i have bless i was looking at  that but i didnt know i could use that on actual objects other than people  taliesin we also have to modify one of the necklaces  laura yeah that needs to go to a blacksmith or something  marisha unless we want to go through the oldfashioned way like the cultists did  liam the oldfashioned way  laura we cant plane shift unless we alter the necklace  taliesin but we have enough necklaces that we could just jump through  
none	 travis that one  marisha we might take a little bit of damage on the way through  travis im game  laura you have a bajillion health points  travis i also thought of something overnight all right it hurt because its kind of brilliant  can you hold your breath for whispering whats higher than ten  ashley whispering 11  travis 11 seconds  sam sure  laura why  travis why dont all you bitches just hop in the bag of holding i jump through take all the  damage for us and then you just 
none	 popping sounds pop right back out  taliesin i can think of many reasons why thats probably not a good idea  travis what could it possibly be  taliesin the bag of holding is a negative space its not designed to sustain life  travis have you ever been in one  taliesin very specifically not because things die in there  liam grog think of all the things youve pulled out of there that look like sloppy joes when they  didnt look like that going in  laura lets put something living inside of there and wait 
none	 ten seconds and then take it out and see  if its still alive  travis but it has to be able to hold its breath if we throw a dog in there  ashley so if it breathes it will die  travis yeah theres no air i dont think  laura if its ten seconds and its not knowing to hold its breath it will come out alive still  travis if you want to do cpr whatever  taliesin what if the things inside take the damage even if they are in the bag of holding

none	 on the robes weve got to pull out an eyeball each too  ashley were already there were standing at the ball  laura are we going down sure  travis were going down to the ziggurat  matt all right you find your way down into the subterranean tunnels beneath whitestone winding  through the caverns until you enter the chamber that contains the ziggurat where you initially  faced off with the briarwoods as you climb to the top there before you you see standing in all of  its glory the black as youve called it spinning 
dung	 orb of death approximately that large  now and its this dark void that as you get close it has this weird vibration to it and  there it is suspended about four feet off the ground at the top of this ziggurat  laura can i get close to it and put the necklace near it without touching it  matt yeah you put the necklace near it and you watch as the sphere this weird grayish aura  around it begins to emanate faintly almost like the closer it gets the brighter this weird gray  aura tends

none	 travis nine  matt 22 points of necrotic damage 22 points of necrotic damage  ashley six  matt 22 points of necrotic damage  marisha 16  matt 22 points of necrotic damage so as you leap into the sphere you feel as if the gravity that  holds you to the ground or sometimes the ceiling bends around you and your limbs are wrenched  forward like someone has you in a full nelson that doesnt end your body is about to be  condensed and crushed when you feel the symbol pulse and the gravity lessens somewhat 
none	 its  still tearing into you and you feel this coldness and this numbness come over your body as you feel  like youre a square peg being pushed through a round hole physically pushed through against your  will you begin to yell out in pain instinctually before it comes to a stop and you all land to your  feet out of breath the numbness begins to fade to immediate pins and needles just pain across  your entire body you feel like someone just raked a number of tacks across every surface of your  skin and 
none	 as the pain begins to throb you can feel the blood pulsing throughout your body as it all  shoots to the surface you still sense that you thanks to your symbols around your neck you  managed to withstand a much more dangerous arrival as your eyes focus you already feel the  chilled air that surrounds you like a cold cold winter morning the sky above is sunless and gray  like an overcast horizon without clouds to texture it breached by distant mountain ranges like so  much broken glass you see behind you immediately the other 
none	 corresponding siphon floating bright  graywhite in color and glowing the same color that you saw briefly shifted to in the ziggurat  near ankharel beneath it you find shards of ruined objects piles of longdead bodies flesh  and bone rended and twisted like theyd been put through some rapid tornado on different sides of  their body and you see a lot of these shattered pieces of wood and metal were all a number of  objects that were thrown in here during the experimental phase when you guys first uncovered  this you look around and notice 
dung	 that you stand atop a rectangular platform of dark smooth stone  about 15 feet on each side beneath the edges about 20 feet down til it comes to the ground  so youre on an elevated stone platform that the siphon is affixed to above floating about four  feet above the top of the surface and you look down to the ground immediately around you and you  see just dry cracked badlands it seems to spread out making up the majority of the shadowfell  around you surrounding your location your sight clarifies to see what appears 
town	 to be hundreds of  buildings and structures that form this shade of an ancient city like a town a sprawling village  half the structures toppled and destroyed piles of rubble and rock the ground itself seems to jut  up in places these tiny shooting spires of black and gray earth that the city has either been built  around or seemed to have grown through as you look past that you see movement throughout the  streets in the distance but before you can focus on that your vision immediately sticks towards  in the center of 
dung	 this circularlike city the standing ominous commanding massive spire of  obsidian black familiar to both of you through two different types of vision youve experienced  a jagged monolith that exudes ancient hatred encircled by dozens of dark winged beasts that  watch over the dreary skies who here is proficient in history  laura nobody is proficient in history  sam were doomed to repeat it  travis really percy  taliesin no i have other qualities history was not my forefront i know whitestone  sam somewhere taryon is reading a history book  matt exactly the 
none	 two of you make history checks with disadvantage because you lack proficiency  yes you being a bard you pick up information in passing with disadvantage each of you  taliesin nine  sam 11  laura oh god  sam thats a bad sign  matt you have no inclination of where you stand or whats before you all you know is you stand  now on the cold plane of the shadowfell the echo of the prime material  laura our notes on the shadowfell  matt you do  taliesin can we consult the rand mcnally  
none	 travis the rand mcnally guide yeah  matt youre welcome to just so you guys know you are all standing out in the middle of the  open on this large stone platform looking down in the center of this giant city  laura there are things that are moving below i see them  marisha and the ziggurat is above us  matt there is no ziggurat there is a large black spire but thats in the center of the city  maybe two miles off  laura as we hop down i cast pass without a trace on 
town	 all of us  liam there are buildings around so are we in the middle of a field a plain badlands  matt there are buildings you see two structures maybe 50 or 60 feet from you on each side and  then going forward from your current position it leads right into the city so this structure is on  the outskirts its right on the perimeter  laura do we see any other orbs around  matt make a perception check  laura 25  matt you glance and in the faint gray sky above you around the 
none	 glowing whitegray orb this side  of the siphon you see a very very faint aura of bluishpurple that is weaving into a thread a  rope almost various strands that knot and twist to form a cord a very barely visible cord that  just drifts up towards the very top of that tower for miles and there at the top of the tower you  see a vibrant sparking pulsing purple glow and from there you can see two other distant strands  that arc off into the very faint other edges across triangulating around the other sides 
none	 of  the outskirts of this ancient city you see the faint glowing whitegray pulse of two other  siphons affixed to two other platforms all these strands converging at the top of the tower  ashley before we get to it can i cast bless on his bullets so i can give them back to him  matt how long does it last  ashley not very long  matt you can theres a difference between casting a spell and enchanting something its a  loose enchantment to bless the ammunition that takes a while to focus on  
town	 taliesin i imagine itll take a few days when its done  ashley when its done  taliesin i dont expect us to be in and out of here i think this is going to take some time  ashley id rather enchant them  travis the structures to our left and our right are they solid do they have focus  matt theyre solid theyre stone buildings theyre homes though plain and cracked there are  sections of wall missing in places as you look about the grounds here and you know this because  youve ransacked and been 
none	 responsible for the ransacking or the rubble of westruun but this  city appears to have been some time long ago under siege you see signs of battle you see  impact you see roofs that were burned and now lie as just black husks this area has seen warfare long  ago and the signs of it are old and it looks like the signs of life that exist in this space the  movement you see of figures in the distance wandering through the streets theres no  immediate threat to this city but you get the sense 
none	 just looking out that something big happened  here a long time ago  travis any of you with the eyes can you see what that is up in the air  laura yeah i also want to look and see what the fuck kind of creatures it is that are moving  around in the city but i want to see what kind of creatures are flying around as well  matt okay so you guys have moved down from the platform and you cast pass without a trace so  id like everyone to make a stealth check 
town	 please adding plus ten to your roll  sam 26  taliesin 22  marisha 27  liam 40  laura 23  ashley 21  travis 18  laura ooh shit you rolled bad yo  matt okay so to stay stealthed you have to find some place to be stealthy youre not  stealthing out in the middle of nowhere where are you going to find  taliesin towards the city  laura those buildings  liam are we temporarily staying put and talking shit out or are we going  taliesin the building on the left id 
none	 say  laura yeah like hide behind something  matt okay you guys dart off to the left it appears to have once been a twostory structure  but the upper level has since collapsed and part of it is falling into the bottom floor as you  begin to approach the doorway on the inside vexahlia you hear what sounds like a faint  crunching sound on the inside  travis nervous laughter what the fuck oh my god  liam whispering whats the matter  laura whispering theres something in this building louder are there windows on the 
none	  building at all  matt there are there is one window on your side and the doorway around the corner  laura peek in  liam ill look in the window with my 40 stealth  matt you glance inside and as you peek over the top in the brief bits of light coming through the  shadow in here you can see the collapsed piles of broken stone and wood planks that used to hold the  structure of the upper level together you can see what looks like furniture thats been destroyed  simple basic this is 
none	 not an extravagantly decorated space built for function  more than anything but moving amidst the shadow you see what appears to be a humanoid creature of  pale gray skin elongated limbs long clawed fingers bald head pointed hooked ears and what  looks to be slightly broken jagged yellow elongated teeth in this jaw as its currently  munching on what looks to be a small furred rodent of some kind crunching  liam this is probably redundant but i will divine sense undead  matt it is very undead  liam do i sense see hear anything 
none	 besides this one  matt whats the radius  liam 60 feet  matt nothing else catches your attention no you watch as it finishes and walks toward the doorway  vexahlia as youre off to the side you watch as this creature leans forward and goes into a  sprint and then leaps up onto a distant rooftop leaping noises just leaping from rooftop to  rooftop as youre watching that leap another movement catches your eye and you see another one  about three blocks down you can see there are at least a handful of these creatures 
none	 stalking  through the ruins leaping from building to building from floor to floor  ashley what was it eating  matt a small furred creature you didnt get a good look at it you got a fair look at it  travis it was an otter i love otters  matt apparently so does the creature  laura why would there be otters in the shadowfell  matt theres something you didnt know about otters laura  marisha they love holding hands  laura does it look like any of those scary creatures are around each other or are 
none	 they  avoiding each other  matt its hard to tell at this distance youre so far out of the city youve only been able to  notice a few shapes from this distance youd probably have to get in a little closer and spend  some time watching their behavior to pick that up  liam im going to crouch down by this dead rodent do i sense the queen more or less here  matt make a wisdom check  liam 18  matt you close your eyes for a second no none  travis can i pop 
none	 my head back out the door and looking at the ground is there any semblance of a  sewer system or a runoff grate or anything  matt make a perception check  travis oh jesus yeah bitch seven  matt no not at all  laura grog get your head back inside  travis what  laura theres things flying around out there  travis im keeping a lookout  taliesin im going to crawl up the wall to the second floor to see whats up there  matt as you go up the side and step over onto 
none	 the rubble you see a large broken what was once the  floor of the top floor that slid into this giant decline this slide of rubble if you will at the  top you can see what looks to be a broken weapon rack that is empty no weapons on it but you get  the sense that this small structure was a perimeter tower outpost  taliesin its been cleaned out  matt apparently  taliesin theres no sign of anybody who used to be here nothing of value nothing of interest  matt not in the structure 
none	 no  taliesin i think were going to have to move deeper in  sam should i make us all ghoulie  travis do we notice anything strange about the little necklaces that were wearing now that were  in this place  matt nothing at the moment no  liam hey you feeling good about your decision to come with us  sam this is terrible i havent had this much fun in a long time lets go do it ill cast seeming  on us and make us all gray pointyeared little nosferatuvampirey things i suppose did i 
none	 see  the thing that skittered out  matt very briefly  sam ive seen other undead things  matt yeah you can make something that looks undeadadjacent  sam yeah my guy will look more like the meat man in undead form but otherwise everyones normal  laura i want straggly but still a braid really nasty straggly hair  sam your ears half off  travis i definitely want an eyeball hanging out  sam sure  taliesin straight hole right through the head no jaw  sam okay  matt all right what do you guys do 
town	  laura i think we should probably try to observe the things that are flying around the tower  taliesin slowly make our way to the town  laura observe still try to avoid any of those scary creatures but see if they avoid each other  as we look at them  liam super slow super careful  sam maybe we should stagger  laura no those things were speedy be normal  sam well walk like this  taliesin left right left step step step  laughter  matt make a performance check no  marisha while they 
none	 were looking at weapons racks and doing stuff like that  taliesin you make it sound so tawdry carry on  marisha while they were doing that i pull vax aside i grab him  sam lets get married  laura lets just do it  marisha goddamn it scanlans back listen you cant die and i dont know whats going on in  your head or what youre thinking but i feel like its not good  liam im the best ive ever been dont worry about me worry about us  marisha has the raven queen spoken to 
none	 you at all  liam yes  marisha recently down here  liam not since we got here no but recently  marisha i need you with us not with her i need you with us and with me so let me do this and  im going to burn my 9thlevel spell and cast foresight on vax  sam ooh foresight  laura what is that  sam shit its real good  laughter  liam this one goes to nine  laura what is foresight  marisha dont fuck it up man its my 9thlevel spell  matt 
none	 for the next eight hours not concentration you cant be surprised you have advantage on all  attack rolls ability checks and saving throws and other creatures have disadvantage on attack  rolls against you  laura holy shit  sam you can see just in the future three seconds  laura thats amazing  liam you guys lets go shopping  laughter  travis i raise my blood axe  matt all right  sam am i going to die in three seconds am i going to die in three seconds  laughter  taliesin lets make our way 
town	 into town quietly  liam within the next eight hours  sam i feel like vax should lead the party  matt all right so are you stealthing through  taliesin yes  laura still being stealthy but yeah  liam looking cool but stealthing  marisha we look so cool  taliesin were not doing  laura matts like i will kill you all  matt you guys scatter just enough to dart between alleys and find shaded bits and leap from base of  building to alley keeping a cohesive unit as best you can the first thing 
town	 you notice the further  in you get even within just the first couple of blocks of the city you see broken swords you see  pieces of armor and you see figures walking through the street ahead of you you see hundreds  of scattered skeletons decomposing bodies shambling through but they all walk in patterns  theyre not scattered mindless there is some will or direction to their movements you see them  wearing ornate armor with designs and symbols on them that look old and tarnished and scratched  liam are they moving like troops or is 
none	 each individual following its own  matt some are moving as troops and occasionally you see an individual wander off but theyre just  sort of walking around and scanning im going to have scanlan you roll a history check and pike  roll a religion check  sam 17 oh you know what seems important i will inspire myself can i do that i havent done  this in so long  matt yeah add a d12 to it  sam 18  matt got to get the dust off man  ashley 23  matt okay you looking 
none	 over there a lot of the armor that these skeletons are wearing it doesnt  fit with the shadowfell the silvers the golds the tattered blue cloaks theres something regal  about some of these armor sets as old and ancient as they may be it doesnt seem to match the sense  and feel of the shadowfell while youre having this thought pike you glance over and look at  one of these pieces of armor and you recognize the symbol its like a stainedglass circle with a  gold star in the center its the symbol of pelor 
none	 many of these bodies these undead wandering the  city seem to have been soldiers that fell in whatever battle that once besieged this city and  many bear the mark of pelor  taliesin i mean the chained  laura the chained oblivion  taliesin the chained oblivion there was a fight between  matt that was but that was on the prime material and that was in the vicinity of the  alabaster sierras  taliesin that mark couldnt have ended up  laura was the shadowfell always the shadowfell  taliesin i dont know  sam maybe 
town	 this city was taken somewhere else or something transported here  marisha does this city look like whitestone  matt no none of the buildings the structures resemble whitestone  sam is there any architecture that i or anyone notices like from a region of where weve been  matt no not really  sam midcentury modern mostly  matt yeah yeah lot of ikea no but you do get the sense some of the architecture here does  resemble elements of some architecture designs that remind you of wildemount  sam man we should have brought tary  matt 
dung	 but like old wildemount like no modern structures definitely from centuries back as you  continue to wander and keep your eyes out you occasionally hear the distant creature  shrieking you watch as the wings flapping winged dark beasts are circling overhead  sam do we recognize them  matt no not yet  laura never seen anything like it  matt you have not seen anything like these before black as night against the gray sky from  this distance you make out no details in their bodies its almost like a moving shadow above  you wherever 
town	 light would hit to give you some sense of structure its just absence void its  just a flying shadow  taliesin are there any buildings that have enough structure to them where it feels like there might  be things inside that have been relatively unmolested at this point  matt possibly make a perception check  taliesin 12  matt 12 i mean there are some buildings that look like they have some structure and the  further into the city you get the more you see that this becomes a little less destroyed but you  begin 
none	 to see some figures moving that are not armored undead not zombies and not any of these  quickmoving creatures you see three figures walking back towards the orb where you guys came  from in the same black cult robes hoods off they would appear to be human  taliesin but theyre cultists  matt but theyre cultists  laura they dont look like theyre afraid of walking around  liam yeah whats their demeanor  matt theyre just walking through  liam how far are they from us  matt theyre about 100 feet up a little further 
none	 than that  liam coming our way  matt coming your way towards the sphere where you guys were  ashley maybe thats what we need to look like  travis cover and ambush  liam or watch see what theyre doing  taliesin kill two keep one to question  marisha how many are there three  matt three of them  taliesin god can we even kill people here will they die  liam yes but do we watch see what they do with the sphere first  taliesin lets cut them off  sam i could be 
none	 bait then you could come ambush them  liam lets watch for a moment longer  travis find cover  matt okay so what do you guys do  travis im going into the building  laura im following them just subtly  marisha yeah let the twins go ahead first  matt okay so the two twins follow and the rest of you duck into a building off to the side okay  you guys i need you both individually to roll stealth as you tail behind them  laura and we still have pass without a trace on 
none	 34  liam 45  sam wait were staying put and theyre walking off somewhere else how are we going to see whats  going to happen  travis they were walking towards us  matt the cultists are basically walking past you guys going the opposite direction of where you  were traveling and both the twins just vanish from sight youre like well what if gone  again you guys pace behind them jumping from alley to alley occasionally theyll stop and do a  walk over theres not a sense of paranoia but theyre very watchful their 
town	 attire while still  cult robes is a little more intricately adorned and you see the one in the front is carrying a  hanging lantern that gives off this weird smoke behind it like a censer  travis a censer  liam yeah like a catholic  matt yeah but it gives off this faint glow and they walk and make their way slowly outside of the  city towards the pillar where the orb is and they just look around it walk over to the few  buildings to the side divide a little bit to a perimeter 
none	 reconvene at the base of the orb and  begin making their way back to the center of the city  laura is there anything else around should we kill them  liam all three take one kill two leave one  sam we can ambush them  laura get ready for an ambush  taliesin when they walk by the house push them  laura when they walk past you guys well attack  sam should i put someone out there to confuse them  liam no when we go follow suit  marisha i can grasping vine one 
none	 into the building right into grogs hands  laura wait until we attack them first  matt all right the three of them walk back leaving a small censer trail behind the smoke  the almost incenselike smoke burns off within a few feet after they eventually cross right next  to the doorway and window to where the rest of you are waiting both of you guys roll for an attack  are you aiming at two different ones same one  laura two different ones and its an automatic  matt its an automatic crit if you hit 
none	 and you have advantage on the hit  because they dont see you  laura natural 20 not that it matters because i already got a crit  matt but still its nice  liam 26  matt 26 both hit go ahead and roll damage both of you doubling your weapon die damage and your  sneak attack  laura bramble shot  sam theres three of them right  matt three of them yes you also double the bramble shot damage because its a crit  sam hey look were killing things well maybe  taliesin incapacitating at 
none	 the very least  liam 85  laura oh shit dude  sam 85  matt 85 damage rogues man its what they do  taliesin the head is cleaved from the body  laura 56 for me  sam it was kima and allura on a mission theyre dead  matt as the three of them walk the two on the outside both at the same time impacts  crumple no noise just fall to their knees face down on the ground unmoving the one in the  center thats holding the censer turns and looks back and sees 
none	  marisha and i go whoosh and grasping vine him and throw him right into grogs hands  laura dont kill him  travis and if hes successfully thrown i just cover his mouth and  grab the back of his head and squeeze  sam which mouth  travis ew god  matt that is a 16  marisha fail  matt fail thats right because 21 so as soon as he turns around out of one of the cracks in  the stonework nearby you can see some dry grasslike gray brush there is what appears to be 
none	  some faint hints of local plant life but it all looks like gray dry grass or you know after a  morning freeze when you see elements of a field that have that weird textured almost water plant  look to it its clusters of that but curled and one of those whips out with this one long  grayish almost fleshylooking vine that wraps around it and yanks it inside the house grunt  gets yanked in grog you catch him  travis cover his mouth  liam like clockwork  matt go ahead and make an athletics 
none	 check grog  travis oh thats a million 26  matt he struggles against your grasp and its nothing its like holding a baby in your arms  travis percy will you give him a reminder not to move  taliesin oh yes this will be fun i take out a small threeinch steel ball i look him right in  the eye and go manners and i toss the steel ball at our friend the iron bands  matt okay what does he have to save on that  taliesin i actually make a ranged attack roll  matt 
dung	 okay make a ranged attack roll d20 plus your dexterity you have advantage because hes  currently restrained by grog  taliesin makes me feel better thank god thats still fine 23  matt okay so as you chuck it the three feet it impacts and you watch as the orb swells and  expands and all of these chainlike plates of dark reddish iron metal wrap around him  constraining his hands his legs and locking him into place around his jaw  and his head and his mouth  taliesin excellent  laura can he still talk  
none	 travis yeah when i take my hand off his mouth  taliesin this thing will allow him to talk i believe this thing has a  matt it has a little slit that you can remove to the side  liam its got a gimp hole  matt all good magical items do liam thats what you call an artifact  taliesin i give him a second to sit and i wait until were all inside  matt okay you guys both attacked  laura pull the bodies inside  matt first make a stealth check because you both exposed 
dung	 yourselves with the attack and there are  creatures overhead shrieking  taliesin with advantage he has advantage  liam plus pass without trace  laura 35  liam 37 thats kind of low for me  matt okay you watch as one swoops nearby and you hear the shrieking and you guys dart by  doesnt seem to take notice you drop back into the building and there you see your quarry now  bolted to himself through a series of dark iron metal plates  travis our quarry does he have two eyes  matt he does not 
none	 have both eyes left eye is missing you see him now this is a man in his  mid40s salt and pepper hair seems to be an unkempt beard around his chin hair is maybe about  earlength a little tattered now since hes been roughed up and manhandled a bit his skins a bit  yellowed a little jaundiced you get the sense hes probably been living here for quite some  time and he doesnt look healthy  laura i grab the thing that was making the smoke and bring it  matt the smell is awful its 
none	 hard to differentiate from the general smell of decay and  dust that this entire realm seems to be suffused with but the smoke that billows off of this is  like fresh putrescence mixed with a very very strong charcoal  taliesin this may be how they move freely  laura thats what im thinking we hide the bodies well bring the bodies inside too so  that nobody sees them  liam press him  taliesin im going to let you speak and were going to have a conversation given where you are  the circumstances that we 
none	 find you in im going to let you know that there is a curse upon my  weapon and the souls that are killed with this weapon are claimed by a demon named orthax now i  havent experimented as to what happens when somebodys soul is claimed by more than one  creature but im excited to find out so wouldnt it be interesting if everything youve been  promised here is suddenly null and void so yes we may threaten your life but i want you to know  that whats really at stake here is just precisely 
none	 whats left of your soul so answer with caution  and i unlock  matt roll an intimidation check  travis that was nasty it was real good  taliesin fucking dice no love on that one terrible eight  matt you unlock and he just goes laughs i dont have to tell you anything  liam i punch him in the temple  matt this pain is meager ive felt far worse ive given myself far worse  pry and poke all you want  liam i punch him in the mouth  taliesin this sort of thing isnt 
none	 going to get us anywhere pike  think you can give him back his eye  laura oh thats a good idea  sam youre going to use a carrot  liam no thats the stick  marisha do you have regenerate with you  ashley i do  laura separate him from his god  ashley i put my hand over his eye  matt he doesnt flinch  laura do it  ashley are you ready to have your eye back  matt ill just pluck it right back out  ashley well you cant because youre just 
none	 going to stay in these binds forever  liam or grog will pull your arms off  matt do your worst  laura no hes not scared of pain  travis just ask him some questions before the fun begins lets see what he answers with  laura do you know delilah briarwood  matt maybe the fact that youre already here means that you have no way out so i fear not  even if i perish i die with the comfort of knowing that youll perish soon after that is the  comfort in the whispered one  
none	 laura vecna  matt so you knowingly came here you are both foolish and simple  travis no thats just me  matt so you said you have questions  travis whats flying around in the sky  matt the sentinels  travis sentinels  matt that is what they are for us but they are known more formally as gloom stalkers  travis gloom stalkers that is a great name  matt they are hungry ever hungry  travis they also look fearsome do people cower before them in their presence  matt you will  travis ill bet
