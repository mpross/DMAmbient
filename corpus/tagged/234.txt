i salute you laura bailey  marisha not even ten seconds  /none/ travis crash and burn  matt so last we left off the mighty nein had found their way back from the menagerie coast to check  in with some friends and the general chaos brewing based on the conflict between the empire  and the kryn dynasty upon traveling making your way towards the city of felderwin a city involved  with notts history you discovered that this apothecary that had burned to the ground belonged  to a male halfling who has now gone missing and discovered that nott had a little boy  after learning about notts history /none/ learned more than that you learned that nott at one point was  indeed a halfling through a vengeful plot by the goblins that stalk the southeastern regions of the  empires marrow valley she managed to help her family escape but was drowned and then  reincarnated by some sort of a hooded power figure that had an alliance with these goblins it  seemed brought back as a goblin and has been living as such for the better part of two years now  upon asking around the city and getting some information you discovered that the husband /none/ of  nott or veth if you will has been apparently taken by the kryn and had some involvement with  his alchemical studies with the cerberus assembly and this study of dunamis you acquired a few  objects from a subterranean basement laboratory that was mostly trashed apparently in the razing  of the city  you then decided to go and inspect the tunnels where these kryn emerged from one of them  apparently was still somewhat intact deciding to not be balked by a sheer wall of stone and rock  jester proceeded to twice polymorph herself /none/ into a dire honey badger and burrow her way through  hundreds and hundreds of feet of rock emerging on the rest of this uncollapsed burrowed tunnel of a  large worm creature they had used to attack without warning the city of felderwin  as you the mighty nein had made your way beyond that boundary and began to step into this  subterranean cavern system stalking and seeking the path that these individuals took here beneath  the surface we begin tonights game first off how would you like to prepare what is your  marching order let /dung/ me know what your plan is now going in to the sheer dark underground beneath  the marrow valley  travis i love it when you can hear the dms frustration in the retelling of the story  laura going like you guys are being really stupid  matt not frustration  travis no  taliesin i would like to know which one of you is hitting the rotating knives first is what he is  matt theyre not knives  laura maybe its not the smartest idea for us to do this is all  travis yeah maybe we /none/ should just leave what do you think pack up and go  sam but my husband  travis mm  sam we spent three months searching for your backstory  laughter  travis im good yknow  it was only a joke nott sorry terrible timing we should push on  sam i hear in xhorhas they have a captain there who has lots of eyeballs that you can ingest into  your body  travis really  sam yes  travis lots of eyeballs  sam lots of golden eyeballs that you can put in your belly  travis /none/ sounds like a magic place this fucker  taliesin i just figured that out okay not even kidding  sam all right what are we preparing  matt well first off a marching order these tunnels here can range between brief bits of  cavern and open chambers to following this carved worm tunnel which is about ten feet wide and is  cylindrical you can have at most two people shouldertoshoulder going through each place i  would like to know for the majority of this journey and tell me when you want to change it  up at /dung/ any point i want to know what your marching order is traveling through here  travis who has the best darkvision i would imagine we should have  marisha i have put on my goggles for sure  travis i have 60  laura i have 60 as well  sam me too but im not very perceptive  laura i am decently perceptive how about you  taliesin im very perceptive but i cant see in the dark  laura oh no really caduceus  travis the two clerics do not go shouldertoshoulder  taliesin no we should probably /dung/ keep a little bit of distance  laura ill stay next to you fjord in the front  marisha can octopuses see in the dark if you do the facemask thing  liam thats not happening here he is a cat no but i have this rag over one of my its dim but  maybe you and i can stand near the middle  taliesin ill stick with you all right  matt we have caleb and caduceus towards the center  marisha i guess ill go up front  travis well you got shitty darkvision oh but you /none/ got the goggles and who are you with nott  marisha no ones called a partner yet  sam ill go with you  taliesin also we should probably have yasha up front as well  laura good call  travis darkvision for yasha  taliesin probably not  matt go look  travis 60 feet  matt there you go yasha and beau at the front behind that caleb and caduceus whos behind them  laura i think it was going to be me and fjord at the front are you perceptive  travis decent  matt so fjord /none/ and jester at the front then nott youre taking the back  sam im with marisha i mean beau wherever she is  matt so then wheres yasha  laura yasha can be at the back  sam yashas in the back sorry matt  matt dont apologize its okay were figuring this out  laura will nugget fit by yasha  matt okay yeah if you would like to have taken your  laura where else will i put him you know  travis i dont know maybe outside of the tunnel back at the place where we were /none/  laura where would they stay  matt i dont have the mini on me at the moment i can do that at the break however as youve  worked out your grouping traveling through these tunnels you go on for an hour two hours  those at the front which would be you two id like you both to make a perception check please  travis i will give you advantage  matt so youre helping  travis helping yeah  laura okey dokey  that would be 19  matt keeping a watch as you guys progress the /none/ faint perpetual decline goes deeper and deeper  beneath the earth the rushing sounds of the underground river that seems to be walking  alongside this passageway slowly fades as you see the river now pass beneath stone the cavern come  to an end and the entrance of the next portion of the tunnel where the worm creature had to burrow  into this chamber there are natural pockets of cavernous areas here but a lot of them arent  connected except for by this particular burrowed tunnel so thats probably going to be the path  youre going /none/ to be looking for wherever youre traveling  laura okay i have a question you guys ive got this supersecret dodecahedron thingy in my bag  that yussa specifically said that we should not be bringing near anything and stuff and now were  taking it right to the source do you think thats a bad idea  travis well as a bit of clarification i think we werent supposed to use it right  anything that would activate it and send off energy i think as long as its in the other  dimension that is her bag its /none/ okay right  laura right unless they capture me and flip my bag inside out and then they have it yeah  taliesin it would still be in a big metal case until they really went through  liam yeah but we need to weigh the risks we are facing and notts husband  sam where would we put it otherwise  laura i dont know  liam there are also people behind us topside whod kill us for this as well  sam wheres the tripod and stuff right now  laura its in my bag as well ive /none/ got the whole setup going  travis youve got the gun and the clip the only way theyre going to grab it and  turn it out is if most of us are dead right  laura right and were only fighting an entire army of soldiers so it probably  wont happen that we will die  sam we dont know that it might be very nice there  laura thats true yasha you think itll be nice  matt yasha stares ahead for a moment and goes having been to places like the coast  its not very /none/ nice  sam lets just make sure you dont get captured and your bag doesnt get grabbed  taliesin no harm in focusing on the positive  travis thats right  taliesin nothing we can do about it  marisha so were going to come to a conclusion later maybe  sam were just looking on the bright side of things  taliesin we cant make a plan until we know what were up against  laura thats true  liam if we are lucky we will overtake them before we return to their home  taliesin and if theyre /none/ too much then well just get what information we can maybe  sneak in while theyre sleeping and scurry out with what we need with no harm no problem  marisha i have no idea what were talking about  travis lets push forward  laura whats in this pocket o cavern anything cool  matt rolling your perception you dont see anything aside from the natural formations  theres the smell of hard water and wet earth that permeates the entirety of this chamber and  continuing on for quite some time the natural chambers and pathways here are /none/ chained together by  these tunnels but within them it doesnt look from anything youve seen so far is lived in you  dont see signs of any other creatures making homes or nests you do see bits of quartzlike  crystal forming from gathered minerals over time  taliesin i really like it  laura yeah its pretty  matt a series of stalactites and stalagmites that find their way through the see thank you guys  for your help  laura t top  matt yes just keep giving me suggestions really figured it out its not condescending /none/ at all  laura are there footprints on the ground  matt make a survival check  taliesin we did find some earlier  matt yeah the previous tunnel  laura 15  matt yeah based on looking at the ground here which is mostly packed dirt and general loose  pieces of pebbles and things that were pushed and ground around by the creature that made its way  through the area in its wake you can see familiar footfalls similar to the shape that youd  previously seen that didnt match the rest of the crownsguard andor the /none/ righteous brand that  existed in the vicinity of felderwin you do notice the trail the tracks of the kryn warriors  that had exited and it does lead and follow the burrowing path of the worm  laura how big of a trail is the worm thing is it like this is it like this  matt its about ten feet wide eight to ten feet wide  laura cool so were fighting these guys and a giant worm creature that is ten feet in width so  hes probably kind of long  travis probably and weve got /none/ lots of room to maneuver in these caverns  sam are you scared  laura i mean im not going to lie nott i am a little bit nervous  marisha i think i would be a little more confident if we had a vague idea of a plan dont  get me wrong super down to fly by the seat of my pants that type of girl but sneaking in killing  people in the middle of the night two armies fight getting captured these all sound like  real big stories  liam i have a question for /none/ you jester you know how you have just turned yourself into the  oversized honey badger  laura yeah  liam could you do that to a giant worm but say turn it into a cow  laura well yeah remember what i did to oh you werent remember when i turned that dragon into  that little thing thats what i could do to a worm i guess i did that to the dragon before you  came in you know when we almost died  liam ja rather than trying to whack away at a gigantic worm maybe /none/ you just make it harmless  but not so little that it loses its new form  laura good call  taliesin like a goat maybe  liam yeah a goat  laura yeah or something maybe like a sparrow or something so it will fly away  marisha i like that better goats are weird square pupils  sam or a firefly we could catch it in a jar  liam i think something small is likely to get smacked and taken out of its newer form it would  need to be something that could take a bit /none/ of punishment  laura like a dire honey badger  liam like that or a cow  sam see look beau we have a plan  marisha encounter worm  sam and marisha turn into a cow  sam profit  travis you know dire honey badgers got claws and stuff maybe a dire sheep  laura ooh thats good i like that fjord  travis yeah anyway  marisha i think they still have square pupils  travis itll hit you in the moment i got a feeling  taliesin is that true  laura also though i cant /none/ do that until we sleep but i dont think were going to run into  them today right because theyre probably really far ahead of us because they got a two week lead  travis totally  taliesin stop laughing dm thats not funny  matt no roll a nature check  travis what are you rolling for  sam yeah just roll a nature check its fine  liam everybodys doing it  taliesin thats an eight my nature sucks  matt you have no idea if sheeps pupils are square  taliesin okay thank you i didnt need /none/ to roll to know that  matt all right  travis we press on  matt you push on what little light you have shoving back the darkness via the dull orb that  caleb is carrying in the center of the heart of your traveling troupe you leave that first  winding cavern and begin to continue down the burrowed hallway created by this worm it  stretches on for a mile two miles five miles  marisha can i keep a lookout to see if theres any markings on the walls any signs of  directional type of /none/ code or language while were walking  matt sure make a perception check  laura traps too  sam traps no they wouldnt think anyone would be following them they covered up the thing with  200 feet of earth and rocks  marisha 19  matt walking along the things you do notice is the stone and earth seems fairly smooth the way  its pushed through but getting up close you can see tiny little scrapes or hooks where you gather  is probably how the creature manages to break through and push its way through through  /none/ expanding and contracting muscles within its long body and these spine or scalelike protrusions  that dig in and pull it along rather quickly underground beyond figuring out the locomotion of  this entity this creature you dont along this part of the journey at least yet see any signs of  purposeful markings essentially continuing on for the next five to six hours still following  this tunnel starting to get a little tired  taliesin at some point we do need to rest  laura i wonder if theres another big pocket o cavern coming up or if /none/ we have to sleep in this  little tunnel  travis i forget what time we entered into the tunnel what time of day was it  matt if i recall it was somewhere around midday a little after noon  travis we could push on for another hour or two but we really should  taliesin mr caleb what time is it  liam well i will tell you  matt id say at this time its probably close to dusk on the surface fucking feat  travis you fucking feat  liam its in the book  matt /none/ i know its in the book  sam were in the boredout tunnel that the worm made right theres no water near us because we  passed water on the way in  matt you passed water in the first cavern that you went through that lasted for maybe about a  mile or so the bulk of it weaving through where a lot of the water passing through that river carved  through the rock over time but then eventually that trailed off and this burrow was the only  other path to take youve been there for a /none/ number of hours now  sam you know that thing where youve gone so far that you cant really we cant turn around can  we it feels like it would be a waste of a day weve got to keep going  travis absolutely  laura mmhmm  matt you keep pressing on all right a few more hours pass people at the front roll perception  checks for me please  laura again  travis ill help  marisha i have a question for caduceus  laura 17  matt good to know you had a question for /none/ caduceus you said  marisha cad do you have any idea how far underground we are  taliesin nope  marisha okay that was my question  laughter  travis succinct  taliesin so glad its one i can answer  matt you continue on for another hour or so you do come to another chamber but its only about 30  by 20 feet wide and its a heavy geode it looks like there are a locked piece a pocket of old  stale air that was opened up as this worm burrowed through you can see broken crystals /dung/ of many  beautiful colors a lot of them milky white quartzlike a few that are almost a purple  amethyst tint to it  taliesin im going to cast light behind the crystal  matt its a beautiful prism as you see the entire room is a scattering of shades of purple  pink and strangely orange it refracts the light in a way you havent seen before and for  the moment this dark ominous space becomes this beautiful disco  taliesin i couldnt help myself  laura magical things live here i bet  marisha ive heard /none/ of faery creatures i bet they live  taliesin im listening very carefully to see if anything any noise is coming from the next room  matt make a perception check  taliesin with advantage no just perception  matt just a perception check  taliesin that is a 19  matt you take a moment and listen to the quiet no sound no vibration  taliesin kill the light again  laura kill it why would you kill it  taliesin well turn it back on but i  laura it was so beautiful  travis we are going /none/ to rest right i mean might as well take advantage of such a nice place  laura yeah lets sleep in here is the ground covered in crystal too  matt yes on the edges of it however where the worm had burrowed through theres a part of the  ground thats digging into a divot the interior of the geodes been carved out in that space  taliesin is there any part of the wall that is still stone and not crystal  matt there are small bits maybe like two or threefeet pockets but a large portion of /none/ this  little geode chamber is mostly covered in crystal  liam has any of the crystal been broken away by the worms passage through here  matt yes quite a bit of it has been cracked and broken  liam does any of it look of value as a rare stone  matt make a nature check for me  sam you could tattoo with it  laura yeah maybe  liam 16  matt a lot of this appears to be natural crystal its not a particular gemstone or anything really  precious per se youre sure you /town/ could probably there are uses for it some people like to use  them as focuses for healing and for general decor simple cheap jewelry can be made from this as well  sam vivid dreams man  matt yeah there you go  liam im going to scoop up a handful of them  laura me too me too its pretty  sam me three  matt okay youre not sure what the worth is you havent delved in the realm of selling or  purchasing crystals in the street before but you imagine depending on the person you /none/ could  probably get a little bit of coin for it  taliesin i can carve out a chunk of wall if we want to put your little dome inside  liam make it the same color as the crystals that are here and then i can also set an alarm around us  marisha its seethrough on the inside right  liam for us yeah but not from the outside  taliesin oh so in that case thats pretty cool then ill  liam i can camouflage it to match this room  taliesin once you build it ill /none/ use stone shape to cover it then so you can give it  a little bit of a shell  liam yeah so its not such a perfect round surface  matt what are you doing  taliesin once he puts up the dome the shack im going to use stone shape to cover it really  quickly with a thin layer of rock to make it look  travis earthen  taliesin earthen its not like five feet thick of rock but a couple inches to blanket it  matt yeah you couldnt cover the entire dome but you /none/ could definitely create a portion of it  thats in a shell  taliesin its going to have a faux front  liam if we leave an area where we can pop our heads out if need be  taliesin oh yeah its going to be an opening  liam did you say you were going to carve a hole to put it inside of or should i make it against  the side of the chamber  taliesin probably put it against so we can see whats behind i dont know what do you think  travis backs against /none/ a wall are always safe  laura this is true i agree with fjord  liam okay  taliesin im going to pull the rock that i used for that front from the wall and im going to  give us a couple feet in if thats possible just to push something ive been looking at  stone shape and what itll do  matt you essentially diffuse element of that rock away from it to create the shell on the  opposite side totally doable you create a hut  liam i take out my book and i slap /none/ it down on the stone surface of this chamber we are in i  take about ten minutes and then there is a hemisphere that is the same color as the chamber  around us as soon as that is done i then take out the silver thread and i start making a little  white picket fence thats not actually a picket fence in front of that  matt you guys take your evenings rest  laura wait im going to use sending im going to send a message to yussa and im going to say  shit i /none/ didnt have time to write it out hello its jester were bringing that dodecahedron  with us were on our way to whispering i cant remember the name of the  sam xhorhas  laura xhorhas do you think its dangerous should we not  sam is that it  travis five more  laura please respond to this message  travis wow  sam getting good at this  laura yeah right  matt theres a pause then the voice comes through well i would say it is not advised to  give it up to pull it out /none/ of your bag but who am i to keep you from taking an artifact  into the heart of danger  laura i think hes cool with it  sam were making the right choice  travis this is 100 what were supposed to be doing  matt you have a high enough wisdom to know that there was a hint of biting sarcasm to his  statement but interpret that as you will  laura mmhmm yeah  travis confirmation were doing good  matt now is everyone taking a comfortable evenings rest within the hut  travis do /none/ we want to take watches were pretty safe right  sam and taliesin no watch needed  laura i mean unless somebody wants to keep a watch and make sure nothing comes by  taliesin thats what the thread the thread will wake us if it  matt you do have a pretty decent setup between the tiny hut and the alarm threads  travis lets all try it everybodys sleeping  laura get a good nights sleep can you put a night light on though because its really pretty  marisha ooh  liam i also send frumpkin out /none/ of the hut to sit in the shadows of the chamber and i tell him to  come and wake me up if he hears anything coming further than the perimeter of the alarm  matt okay you guys all find yourself to rest here deep beneath the surface of exandria for  some of you dreams come for some of you no its a clean sleeptowake experience until  eventually you slowly come to consciousness feeling rested though strange to not have a day  or night cycle nothing has changed from your experience you feel like youve rested /none/ but have  you it could have been an hour it could have been eight hours being this far beneath the  surface for an extended period of time is going to be a little strange for those of you who have  not had that experience which is all of you  liam legitimate question because i dont want to dick with the story youre weaving  but does keen mind cut through that  matt you would know thats a good question let me look it up real fast  travis look how pretty that book is god /none/ sexy  sam it really is sexy  matt you always know the number of hours left before the next sunrise or sunset id say yeah  youd be able to tell everyone even just informing everyone of the time its still  liam it wont mean anything to them theyll be  matt you can say it and be like oh yeah guys its 900 in the morning youre like cool  no issues nothing has changed frumpkin did not notice anything out of the ordinary as the hut  comes to a close and you step out from /none/ behind the somewhat created stone shell placed by caduceus  the tunnel is yours  taliesin lighting it up again because its nice  sam on we go  liam frumpkin also skips up notts back and snuggles in grips her clothing with her claws  his claws damn my original cat and scarfs around notts neck  matt you got it as frumpkin keeps you warm in the throat region  you all continue onward same order  travis mmhmm  matt those helming the charge at the front either each take an individual  perception check or you /none/ may help for advantage  laura go for it okay okay okay  liam mage armor  matt mage armor yeah good call  laura 19 again  matt nice a few more miles of winding tunnel continue before you and its a very trying  monotonous experience where its lengths of time and travel where theres no real change  in topography slight variations as it winds in this natural shifting with the physicality of the  creature that burrowed it but its this cylindrical of stone and earth for hours  and hours until you catch the next /none/ first glimpse of another chamber opening before you  laura do i see any movement in it  matt you do not see any movement as you get a little closer you can begin to see the interior  of the chamber near where it opens up inside the air here is already pretty chilly here beneath  the surface the air has more moisture to it than the tunnel youve been traveling through  you can smell a bit of that heavy mineral subterranean water scent you listen in for  a second and you can hear the subtle /none/ dripping of condensation probably from the ceiling  which means theres probably a nearby water source somewhere in the vicinity  there is a chamber that opens up ahead of you  laura theres a chamber ahead of us  sam oh my god  laura it sounds wet nott  sam no  laura i know i know  sam ah  laura i didnt think wed have to deal with a water issue down here  sam well you said it sounds wet what does that even mean  laura there could be an underground river i dont /none/ know  sam or it could just be wet  travis dripping water noises  laura or yeah it could be that or it could be a water monster  sam or fjord could be dicking around with his cheek trick  travis sorry was i throwing you  laura when we approach it im going to cast pass without a trace on all of us and  well approach it stealthily what do you guys think about that  sam yes yes yes good idea  laura okay were approaching it stealthily  matt roll stealth checks for me /none/ please  sam laura and marisha stealth checks  sam dont fuck me gil  travis natural 20  laura add ten  travis 30  matt pass without a trace good call  laura oh what is everybody going  taliesin yeah we already did it  travis 30  taliesin 21  marisha 31  laura 24  sam and liam 30  matt did you roll for yasha as well  travis oh balls and anus here you go 22 no  laura plus ten  travis 24  matt moving into the chamber as it opens /none/ in you can see this area has quite a heavy clustering  of stalagmites and stalactites all across the interior of this chamber it opens up maybe  40 or so feet wide and it seems to curve around this large bend elements of it rise while you  do not see a river looking up at where the waters dripping from you get the sense  there might be a large body of water not that far above elements of the groundwater are  trickling through and elements are gathering to create the interior of this chamber  taliesin /none/ i did not prepare for that  laura what would be above us  travis oh a river pond  taliesin there was a river  marisha underwater water source  laura yeah where are we we could figure out where we are wheres the map  liam weve been traveling for miles though  laura yeah but we know which direction were going  liam thats true i know which way is north its that way  matt yes you know where north is  laura were under the big river then maybe  matt you dont have a /none/ gps per se but you know where north is  liam no but the whole time weve been walking ive been conscious of which direction north is in  matt right so you have a vague idea youve been traveling for a day from felderwin right  so its about say 24 miles in a day youd be about there this vicinity here  so youre right in this vicinity  travis yep bigass body of water big enough to show up on a map  matt there are the heavy stalagmites and rock protrusions from the ground that  /none/ litter the interior of the chamber as it curves off to the side  taliesin well thats a good sign that means that this is at least a natural cavern which  means its been here for a long time and whatevers above hasnt disturbed it  laura good point  taliesin thats good thats a good sign  liam from where we are i dont know if i can because i can only see from this little bit of  dim light but where from this chamber the worm continued on straight through  matt you cannot see where /none/ the worm went through  liam cant see the other side  matt cant see the other side it looks like the worm when it entered this chamber  you dont see in your vicinity where it may have continued to burrow  laura oh we have to find it  matt you get the sense that maybe this creature and the people that were steering it  were leading it through whatever open chambers were possible and then only  burrowing when there was no continuation  liam maybe gave it a runaround in here like a dog in /none/ a dog park  laura i guess we should search around and see if we can find a hole in the wall  taliesin yeah im going to have a little light and see if i can find any tracks or  anything for this thing or any other footprints  matt make a survival check  marisha i look to see if theres any signs of life any humans that have been here before people  matt youre looking for  marisha signs of life or signs that people have been here before  travis biped signs of life /none/  laura follow their path or something  marisha yeah campfires that have been extinguished  matt okay so both of you are looking for essentially signs of things  laura i will look for a hole in the wall  matt okay perception check and then survival check from each of you  taliesin i got a 21  matt 21 okay  sam you got this  marisha 11  sam you dont got this  laura nein wait plus 14  matt thats better all right looking around you continue to see the footfalls the footprints  /none/ along the patches of ground where it seems like dirt and dust has been settled in areas that are  a little bit wet from the moisture in the air you can see some of these grimy recesses in the muck  and the dirt that is similar to the footfalls youve already seen in previous chambers of what  appears to be of the kryn you can see some of the stone formations in the ground two of them appear  to be broken and pushed over where it looks like the creature may have shoved its way through /none/  it goes around the edge and then curves up out of sight you can try to continue to look in that  direction but from what you can see the vicinity thats the path its taking  you were looking for  laura holes in the walls  matt holes in the wall all right looking around the vicinity you dont see any holes in the wall  you do see there are elements in the rock where there are cracks and you can see where small bits  of water are slowly dribbling through and then dripping  /none/ laura i bet the rock formations in this room are amazing  matt theyre pretty decent  laura that one looks like a fried egg look at that do you see it  sam i do  laura looks like an egg on the top do you see  sam i do and its even a little bit yellow you should probably paint a dick on it  laura i probably should  sam i mean you could tag the whole place  laura gasps oh my god i should make this a temple to the traveler  sam yes /none/  travis well jester arent temples better served by like heavy foot traffic you know  laura yeah but think about how cool it would be if someone came down here and they were like  whats going on and then they find like  sam its a speakeasy  laura yeah yeah yeah  sam but its like a prayeasy  laura and then they like they find it theyre going to be like that is like so important  i must definitely worship this guy because and it will at least get one person you know added  /dung/ sam you could be the bouncer  liam ja but how much time do you need to dig up this cave  laura i dont im just going to im going to paint you know a really nice picture of  the traveler then im going to use my paint my special paint and im going to make  a nice little figurine of the traveler and ill sit it on top of the bestlooking rock formation  that looks like its definitely for him im going to paint like pretty things  around him like sparkles and shit  /none/ matt perfect so you paint a little figure of the  travis well keep an eye on the entrance and exits  matt so youre watching the entrance  travis ill go to over where we think from beaus notes the creature seems to have gone  matt okay so yeah as you walk over there there is an area where it curves in then rises up  a little bit to the left you can see a small pool of water where its gathered  and created this little tucked in the side pool maybe fivefoot by 15 feet /none/  taliesin does it smell clean is it clear  matt go ahead and get close to it it looks clear it looks very  taliesin can i see the bottom  matt you can see the bottom it looks to be no more than have five six feet deep you can see  where it continues up off to that side jester finishes painting the statue  you look around for somewhere to place it there are a number of these larger  rock formations five ten feet tall eightfoot tall little squat ones what do you want  /none/ laura im going to put it on the little squat one  matt okay  laura but then put some of the crystals that i got in my pocket like around it  then on the tall formation im going to write the traveler is the tits worship him  sam nice  laura like vertically  matt perfect all right shes writing that down you were at the front  travis mmhmm  matt whos watching the back  taliesin ill keep an eye on the back  matt all right perception check both of you guys just to /dung/ make sure youre keeping watch  marisha just looking over his shoulder  travis nice 20 20 no 21  taliesin 24  matt all right you watch the distant path the dark that continues curving up off to the side  you look over there no movement youre looking towards the tunnel where you guys came from  no movement you hear the chuckles and look back at what theyre doing you see one of these  stalagmites these tendrils slurping need to roll initiative  yelling  matt actually only you need to roll initiative because they  /none/ sam they they he it  matt and laura they  matt get a surprise round  travis oh no  sam we all took feats that make us immune to surprise right  laura yeah we all took luck right we all took luck  travis 18 is pretty good considering i have no initiative bonus  sam and marisha you have no initiative bonus  travis no  sam whats wrong with you  travis i dont know halforcs i dont know  sam why am i rolling these weird dice today  travis i could have taken /none/ a feat that wouldve given me but  laura oh see think about how  all oh  travis what is this thing  liam ropers  sam this is a great map  laura what are those things  travis what is that sadistic japanese traffic cone  laura so wait where are we putting the traveler stuff  matt by this little tiny squat one  laura okay  liam oh my gosh  laura oh its so cool  sam they look like stalagmites  liam we are in the kill zone yall  matt you were /none/ over on this side looking off this way  travis oh fucking balls what is this  matt nott were you helping them out  sam no i was hanging out with beau wherever beau is  matt beau is right there  sam yeah sure  matt yasha will be keeping an eye not noticing caleb where were you  liam i would be by the largest grouping of people because im scared of everything  travis laughs what the fuck is that  matt all right then  liam this is real bad  travis is it  /none/ liam well  laura no its real bad  liam you dont know i dont know  matt so initiative orders 25 to 20  laura oh i didnt roll  matt i just said roll initiative  laura i know but i thought you said dont because they got a surprise  matt just so we have it  laura oh no six  matt okay 25 to 20  marisha 19  sam thats not 25 to 20  marisha its not but no one else spoke up  matt its fine  travis 18 for fjord  /none/ matt all right 15 to ten  travis yasha got a 14  liam 12 for caleb  taliesin 12 for me as well  sam 12 for me as well  laura lot of twelves  marisha so cad caleb nott  taliesin this is going to be  sam its going to be easy  marisha i had a screamer earlier  matt then we have jester at the bottom  laura im really distracted you know because im  sam painting  laura im painting a beautiful  matt so fjord you go first  travis i /none/ do  matt youre the only one who noticed them in this scenario because you were the one whos  closest to the actual caduceus is facing on the back side of the chamber what are you doing  travis well i have a short moment of freak out as a rock formation grows fucking tentacles  matt yep two of them you see that one and go shit shit and you see them both go gurgling  travis since the rest of the group doesnt seem to have noticed them i will charge up two  eldritch blasts and /none/ send one in each direction  matt all righty  travis point both of them out  matt go for it roll attacks for each  travis i will do it  that is 16 to hit  matt it poofing just dissipates without effect across its rocky armored surface  travis not good can i bonus action hex the second one  matt sure  travis before the other attack  matt which one this one  travis yeah  matt all right  travis thatll at least help a little bit 17  matt poofing no effect you /none/ watch as the eldritch energy the green burst just  scatters across its rocky exterior no impact  travis big trouble  sam what  marisha what did you roll  travis 17 didnt hit it ill come up on top of that platform and take a little bit of cover  behind that yeah just right there is good i dont know what the fuck they do  sam did we see these attacks fail  matt you all of a sudden heard a poof and you heard him shout as you turn around and saw  fjord shout /none/ big trouble and then vanish behind a nearby rock like a hero  travis or a tactician  matt i know in this moment of realization of whats happening these two large  stalagmites suddenly have a single eye that opens in the center this burning red  orangeish eye with a vertical slit the center of it opens up into this large  gaping mouth of sharpened teeth and a liquid tongue on the inside thats  slimying around these four tendrils that unravel so its now their turn  its going to move there five ten  travis /none/ nervous laughter  sam they dont move fast but oops  matt they shift it looks like theyre gliding but theres thousands of tiny cilia  underneath that just cause them to glide across the ground this one on this end is  going to go ahead and make three attacks each can make four tendril attacks  travis four  matt yes so  laura oh my god were going to die  marisha oh we might  sam no youre going to die  matt jester that is a 21 to hit  laura it hits me  /none/ matt all right you are grappled  laura oh no  matt while youre grappled you are restrained and have disadvantage on strength checks  theres one now to beau thats going  to be a 14 to hit  marisha miss  matt against beau again thats going to be a 25 to hit  marisha ah yeah  matt so you are grappled  marisha just grappled  matt yep  sam oh okay they dont hurt  laura maybe the next turn they will swallow us whole  sam i dont think so  travis no evidence /none/ to support that  matt well say youre grappled beau youre also grappled im putting  restrained there because you are technically restrained as well against nott  sam what me  matt yep as it whoosh out that way that ones going to be 17  sam miss  matt misses you just duck underneath the fourth ones going to swing out  towards you as well thats going to be a 20  sam hit  matt you are also grappled  laura oh my god wait was that all just one creature attacking us or was that /none/  matt correct  sam theres no save against this grapple  matt you can try and escape it its an action to try and escape from the grapple  you can still attack but youre restrained so you have disadvantage on your attacks  marisha strength check versus their strength check if i remember correctly  matt its your athletics or acrobatics you choose  laura okay  matt now its going to go ahead and make a bite attack against jester because  youre the closest one to it since youre restrained it has advantage on the attack /none/  its a natural 20 and a three so natural 20 it is so thats going to be ooh oh no  laura if i go unconscious right away  sam it was a great game  laura this was really fun guys  travis stop rolling so many dice  laura i went out doing what i love  sam painting dicks  matt 34 points of piercing damage from the critical hit as its tendril pulls you  in towards its mouth shoves your shoulder and the side of your neck into it and it  grinds down /none/ onto you the armor pulls in and you can feel it piercing the back of  your neck sharp pain arcs through your body  laura pained noises  travis maybe we get the fuck out of here that was a big hit  matt this one here is going to go ahead and go for caleb for an attack  liam yeah  matt thats going to be a 14 to hit  liam shield  matt shield whoosh it actually almost grabs you and in the last minute you throw your hand up  and an arcane barrier /none/ flashes in front and the tentacle gets knocked off limply yes  laura can i use my hellish rebuke  matt yes you may  laura okay is it okay  matt go for it  laura ah okay okay okay  matt hes got three more tendril attacks  laura oh god  travis three more  matt each round they get four each  taliesin and a bite  matt yep  travis how about they fought in the last week and one of them is missing one  matt havent encountered adventurers in a while buddy  /none/ travis like sharks in the wild and theyve got battle damage you know  matt i admire your creativity  travis okay  laura 3d10 damage  matt 3d10 damage as it bites into you you angrily focus  laura screams ooh 19 points of cold damage  matt and whats its save  laura oh its a dex save  matt dex save haha a two  laura yes  taliesin the damage seems to take  matt the damage definitely takes shattering these ice crystals suddenly  apparate around its mouth where it bit into jester and it /none/ seems to pull back a bit  its eye closes and winces with the impact now its other attacks its second attack  against you caleb thats going to be an 18 to hit  liam does not hit  matt because the shields still up  liam yeah  matt deflects the second attack  taliesin thank god  matt third ones going to go for caduceus  taliesin is it close enough  matt it has a 50foot range on its tendrils  exclamations of shock  matt reaches out thats going to be a 21  taliesin /none/ that hits  matt all right  travis thats terrible  taliesin okay good to know no this is good so were not going to waste time  trying to be safe from these things  matt now you are also grappled  taliesin again what does grappled mean it means i cant move  matt well you are considered grappled but while youre grappled you are restrained  which means you have disadvantage on attacks you also have disadvantage on  strength checks and strength saving throws  taliesin okay and i cant move  matt you cannot move /none/ your speed is zero  taliesin thatll do  matt its fourth and final tendril its going to go ahead and shoot for caleb again natural 20  liam that hits  taliesin hes within 30 feet of me isnt he  matt yeah  taliesin all right im canceling the natural 20  matt well it still hits but it doesnt  taliesin but the critical does not take  matt right it doesnt do any damage the tendril is just a  taliesin oh its not a damage oh never mind so it doesnt get anything special  /none/ matt right it gets one bite attack per turn but it grapples each of you  just letting you know you probably want to hold onto that  taliesin okay no if its not doing anything then theres no point  marisha no dont please stop please stop dont touch me  taliesin i am panicking just a little  matt thats okay you are also grappled there caleb and restrained  marisha it was so pretty when we slept in a geode that was awesome remember that  travis yeah draw that  taliesin is it time to start /none/ having the flashbacks are we at flashback point  matt its going to use reel  travis what do you mean reel these attacks are real  matt pulls caduceus into it and caleb into it  taliesin okay thats going to be interesting  sam i lose all the close men in my life  matt its going to make an attack against you as you are restrained attack rolls  against you have advantage a two and a one motherfuck it goes towards to bite you  and the shield is still holding and its pulling you in /none/ towards its mouth but  you see the barrier pressing and bits of its rock exterior are cracking  being pressed up against this shield  liam caleb says whimpering apprehensively  matt all right surprise rounds done top of the round beau youre up first  marisha okay can i get closer to the roper  matt you are currently grappled and restrained you have no movement  marisha i was hoping he would do the reel thing but to me because id love to get real  matt well technically you are adjacent to it because youre both /none/ right there  and its in this space you and jester are both adjacent to it  marisha so i can hit it  matt yes you can hit it nott it did not reel you in that turn because i forgot  it can do the reel as part of its action  marisha well i dont know what else to do but to wail on this motherfucker  first attack is real bad its a natural two next attack is not that much better 20 total  matt your attacks have disadvantage by the way because youre restrained /none/  marisha okay then i will reroll that one with a natural one so thats cool  matt miss that two attacks so far  marisha thats two attacks so far  matt the first attack you cant quite get your hand free you manage to get it free  for a second attack and it hits the rock no impact still have your bonus action  sam she punched and it does nothing  matt she rolled low  marisha i rolled a two then a one technically but you roll disadvantage  does disengage count if youre grappled /none/  travis i dont know what these things are  matt you can disengage but you still have no movement you have to escape from it to gain your  movement speed back right now youre wrapped up by its tendril and you cant go anywhere  marisha so disengage wouldnt help me escape from it  matt no disengage prevents attacks of opportunity but you cannot get away  from it to even trigger one  travis could you use your action if she hadnt already  matt fjord youre on deck with yasha after that you can use /none/ your action  to try and break free yeah  marisha but i already used my action to attack so i might as well flurry of blows  matt there you go flurry of blows get two more strikes on it each with disadvantage  marisha disadvantage on the first one nope thats a two again second one is  a natural 20 and a 12 bringing me to a 20 total  matt 20 just hits the first one doesnt even get out the second one hits the rock  and hurts you get your other arm free and /none/ impacts into the stone again this time  you look down as the eye opens up and you see the eye and go whack right into the  center of its giant glowing eye roll damage on that one  marisha its terrible two seven damage i turn to everyone and go  i think i broke my wrist then thats it  matt thats the end of your turn  marisha yeah  matt cool that brings us to fjord  travis ill use my 30 feet and i will come around that cover and i will run down /none/ to the  marisha can i do the thing no i have to hit twice never mind nope  matt you can do stunning strike if you want to but thats up to you  marisha oh can i do that  matt yeah even when you attack on your flurry of blows as long as you hit with  an attack you can do that  marisha stunning strike  matt all right spend another ki point constitution save its a natural one  motherfuck  marisha fake crying there is a god okay thats my turn  liam /none/ and shes smiling on you  marisha yes she is  matt well take this stunned token and put it on this one  travis that is a lot  laura what is that other purple thing on him  matt thats hex  laura hes hexed  matt correct now fjord you can take your turn as you take your turn you look  over and watch as beau plunges her fist into the eye of this living stalagmite and it  starts suddenly wriggling in place it looks like its having a rough time  travis amazing i /none/ will run up and take two swings with the summers dance  falchion against the stunned  matt your attacks have advantage on it because it is stunned yes  travis thats amazing okay that is a 29 to hit  matt that hits  travis the second one is not as great that is only a 19 misses  matt got you 19 just barely misses unfortunately  travis yeah all right eight 12 oh 1d6 for hex 15 points of slashing damage  matt you rush up with one attack carve across with the scimitar and you expect /none/ it  to completely deflect the blow but the blade does cut through the rock where it splits  where the blade was there is a muscly fleshy interior the creature is heavily  armored by the shell its created around itself but its definitely mortal your  second strike however glides against the  outside of its rocky shell and makes no damage  travis i am going to use my bonus action and use misty step on the falchion  to bamf back up on the platform  matt all right right there  travis yep and that /none/ is my turn  matt i would say because you can only misty step to places you can see you can  go there but you have five feet of movement left so you move there anyways  just as a point of reference that ends fjords turn yashas up  travis yasha would like to rage she will rush the traffic cone from hell that is  attacking caduceus and caleb and take two strikes with her magicians judge  matt go for it  travis reckless attacks please  matt all righty  that is a natural 20 /none/ for the first one and the second one is only a ten  matt that first hit all the impact and might smashes into this creatures face  and she pulls back and thats all i had  travis i love barbarians so much counting 13 times three is 39 right  yeah 39 points of slashing damage  matt times two you mean  travis oh times two sorry 26 not times three times two 26  matt any bonuses on top of that  travis thats it yeah oh no sorry rage is three 29  matt 29 /none/ points of damage from that first strike as the magicians judge carves down through it  one of the tentacles gets damaged and you can see it still holding tight but starting to wear  this thing down still looking okay though that finishes yashas turn  travis it does  liam is that all the 12s is that all the 12s in a row  matt theyre after the ropers theyre right before you guys theyre squeezed right between  yasha and your trios turn this one here is going to reel in nott now you get pulled  /none/ sam wait they can do that even though theyre stunned  matt oh that ones stunned so it cant never mind that one right there is going to attempt to  ensnare with one of its free tendrils yasha that is going to be a 15 to hit  travis that hits  matt it hits she is also now grappled and restrained its going to make  a bite attack against caleb  travis so hitting it doesnt make them drop the grapple  matt you have to break free  travis i was hoping that would be the /none/ case  matt thats another natural 20  taliesin cancelled  matt reaction from caduceus to whats the ability called again channel divinity  taliesin its actually not a channel divinity its called sentinel at deaths door  matt was it once per short rest  taliesin no its five times per long rest  laura and sam five times  taliesin as long as im within 30 feet of somebody who suffers a critical hit you can  turn that hit into a normal hit any effect triggered by the critical hit is canceled  matt grave clerics man /none/ thats awesome  taliesin five times per long rest  matt well be thankful he reduced that critical 28 points of piercing damage  as it jams your entire arm into its mouth and its starting to pull you in from the  torso up the other one is stunned and does not get its turn that brings us to the trio  liam one handed caleb gets the molasses out and starts smearing it and casting  taliesin wait should i  matt hes already going hes already on it  liam im going too late and i cast /none/ slow on both of them  matt whats the save  liam 16  matt what is it wisdom  liam wisdom yeah  matt this is for the guy over there 14 he is slowed  liam he can do one thing per round now while thats up yeah it just brought all  those tentacles down to one thing per round  matt that guy is a 15  liam fails  matt theyre both slowed  taliesin okay its about to get worse for them  travis those circles are so great  matt yeah a fan /none/ sent those actually  liam a negative two penalty to ac and dexterity saving throws cant use reactions  it can use either an action or a bonus action not both  matt youve got it caleb thats your go  liam pained yelling  matt casting frantically with the offhand their whipping tendrils that are wrapping  you all of a sudden go slowdown sound its chewing on caleb is like slow grinding  liam im getting the molasses everywhere  matt jesters still part way in like oh god slow chews nott or caduceus  taliesin ill take /none/ it slow down cowboy im casting bane on these two  matt whats the save  taliesin the save is a 16 charisma  matt charisma oh they are not charismatic  taliesin yep i didnt think they would be  matt there is a 12 and a zero  taliesin that means that you have to take a negative d4 to attack rolls and saving throws  matt yeah youve got it  taliesin on both of them im going to then spend my bonus action and  im going to call a swarm of insects im going to /none/ drop it on the lets get one of  these out of the way first lets get the one thats far away from me  im going to drop it right on him that swarm of insects is going to take a bite  matt caduceus is pulled in manages to curse them both with this divine power  pulled from the wildmothers darker side of nature and then holds the staff up through  a burst of insects beetles then fly out of it clouding around this central  stalagmite and begin to assault the opposite side of the /none/ creature  taliesin hard to hit lets see if i can actually hit because my tohit is  matt it is still stunned so you have advantage on your attack  taliesin oh well thats exciting  matt its stunned until beaus next turn  taliesin 18 is the highest hit  matt 18 just hits because of the slow spell their ac is reduced by two  taliesin this is a bite attack which is 4d4 hit ten 4d4 piercing damage  its ten plus 4d4 i believe  matt no its just 4d4  taliesin why does it /none/ say ten i dont know  matt ten is the average damage  taliesin oh counting thats ten  matt ten points of damage the beetles are now biting into the side of this entity  that finish your turn  taliesin that finishes my turn  sam i will not try to leave the grapple instead i will fire a crossbow bolt  at this one that has me grappled  matt youve got it  sam with advantage because its stunned  matt it is stunned yes  sam oh not good both of them not good 15 /none/  matt 15 misses it ricochets off of its rocklike hide the bolt goes scattering  off into the shadows somewhere  sam bonus action fire again  matt go for it  travis tentacles made of rock as well  matt they appear to be of similar material they have a similar look to them  but theyre flexible so theyre probably not as  sam 28  matt 28 does hit and it is adjacent well its stunned anyway  so you do get your sneak attack damage on it  sam yeah  matt all the dice /none/  laura woo  sam oh theres a couple ones okay 22 plus ill do fury of the small  thats another eight thats 30 points of damage  travis boom  matt 30 points of damage nice as the first bolt ricochets you see a spark as the rocklike  exterior shoots it off as its sitting there groaning with its one eye open its jaw still  chewing on jester jester manages to wedge herself out of its mouth just in time for you to aim the  bolt into its throat it begins to cough a bit /none/ of its own blood its looking pretty hurt  sam good good  matt that ends your turn nott  sam thats all ive got  matt jester youre up  laura okay im going to turn since that ones letting me go and im going to put my hand  towards the other one ill say get the fuck out of my temple im going to cast banishment  matt oh shit  sam banishment what  laura yeah thats a charisma save  travis good call  matt it rolled a natural 16 minus two  cheering  /none/ laura it needed a 16 save so  matt this guy vanishes the tendrils are no longer around you so none of them are  travis thank god he didnt take anybody with him  laura well he wouldnt have done that here  matt youre all of a sudden released from it and the creatures just not there anymore  laura hell only be gone for a little bit we should probably get out of here  also kill this guy huh then i turn back to the dude thats in front of me  matt right because youre /none/ still wrapped up by its tendrils  laura yeah i cant do anything else i dont think yeah thats all i can do  matt beau youre up  marisha ah doobah  matt it is stunned until the end of your next turn i believe right  marisha thats the way it works  matt you still have advantage on the attacks you have disadvantage  because youre restrained so its just a straight roll for you  marisha im still restrained  travis that cobalt fighting style doobah  marisha im going to stir around my stick and /none/ try and jab it into his eyeball  matt go for it  marisha wait straight roll  travis yeah straight roll  marisha im going to get rid of all those it never happened i dont think it worked  nope thats a 14  matt 14 misses youre punching a rock and its hurting  but youre going to get through looking for those soft spots  marisha second attack  liam ooh it was almost a one and then it was better  marisha now its a 19 so it definitely hits  matt yes that hits /none/  marisha that was with my staff i said so its a d8 seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage  marisha im going to restun it can i do that stunning strike  matt that is an 18 so it resists it  marisha okay im going to move on from that  taliesin the d4 wait and also is there anything else he gets from slow for saving throws  liam negative two ac and dex saves  matt thats minus two to it so its a 16 whats your dc  marisha 14  /none/ matt yeah so it resists it  marisha flurry of blows wait why do i keep rolling twice i keep thinking  i need to roll twice just once ah natural 20 its so manic but its true  matt i saw it  marisha doubling the dice thats a three plus a six so thats 11  matt 11 points of damage on that strike as you jam the staff into the middle of its mouth  and are prying it open you get down and see where its eye is trying to keep closed  and the moment /none/ it flicks open to be aware of its surroundings you whack poking it right there  marisha going for the uvula last one 18  matt 18 just hits because of the slow spell  marisha for this one im going to try and grab onto its tongue because i know  lot of blood vessels in the tongue and start trying to rip it another 11 damage  matt 11 points of damage oof this thing is not having a great moment  marisha i say drop it drop it  matt fjord youre up  travis ill run /none/ back up and take two swipes with the summers dance falchion  laura i really hope you guys kill it before it gets back to its turn  travis yeah me too first one is a 28 and the second one is a 29  matt both hit damn nice it is no longer stunned actually did you roll  with advantage or did you roll regularly  travis just straight  matt good its no longer stunned so you do not have advantage on the attack  travis nice ten plus four is 14 points of slashing damage with /none/ four points  of necrotic in there from the hex the second one is eight plus six 14  plus five points of necrotic for 19 points of damage  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  travis like a hero i run up behind it and take inspiration from beau and i go whoosh  doobah  matt you see fjord holding the pose there for a second as beaus holding its tongue  and the tongue comes out you look past and watch as its eye goes limp  and it shifts off into /none/ three separate pieces  laura hi fjord thank you  travis youre welcome  laura we should leave  taliesin how long does that thing stay  laura not long at all like probably another minute or so so run  sam okay lets go  travis yeah lets book wait whos yeah well heal on the way  matt you guys book it  sam do we need to loot the bodies  laura theres not its rocks  travis actually yasha will run up to caleb as were running and she will do  healing touch because she /none/ never does that shit to caleb and put what is it  healing hands healing seven points she never wastes an action on that  sam ropers  matt ropers man  travis is that what theyre called  matt yep  liam were on the move ja hup hup hup  marisha caleb do you have any use for this nott nott  sam whats that a tongue  marisha roper tongue  sam yeah ill take that  matt you can add a roper tongue to your inventory  sam to my belly  matt there you go /none/ thats the other inventory  laura its like beef jerky  matt its pretty tough  travis like octopus  matt strangely salty its the minerals as you guys are rushing up around the edge  the cavern ends about another 50 or 60 feet up front it just ends  marisha what  sam this is not the right way  travis oh lets go back and check that water  sam but if we go back the thing will be back  taliesin why dont we all prepare i havent put my insects away  and we can /none/ just kill this thing off really  matt jester make a perception check  taliesin i still have a swarm of insects im for the moment  going to keep my insects down there just in case  laura 12  matt youre looking around and the tracks that you noticed earlier you guys pick up on  and you see that it is still traveling this direction you can glance at the area  though the wall itself is this surface of loose rock and stone formations there  travis can i walk up and touch it and see /none/ if any of it moves or is different  matt following the tracks there is an area where it looks like the stones are  just loosely there part of the wall fell in and covered the interior  but you can pull stones out of it  travis yeah ill start doing that  liam im going to keep my eyes behind us where we just ran away from  laura yeah same im going too  matt okay so you start pulling stones out and passing them off some of them are  pretty heavy yasha is helping /none/ you guys are pulling them out one by one you get a  small section of opening available to you it wasnt a huge collapse it looks like  when it was passing through it might have bumped into the wall and caused a portion  of it to fall in and its only the lack of light in here thats really making it hard  to originally even notice this exit you get halfway through it before you  hear whoosh in the room behind you  sam and laura oh its back  taliesin is it back to /none/ exactly where it was before  matt yes  taliesin its immediately attacked by an insect swarm  matt go for it it moves very slow you glance back in the area and it goes squelching  it moves ten feet a round and youre about a hundred feet from it around that way  laura good but its got a 50foot reach  taliesin 22  matt itll be about another minute before it gets within range 22 that hits  technically its still no its not slowed anymore because slow has worn off  liam its a minute /none/ duration  matt right its been banished for a minute  liam okay magic missiles  matt laughing go for it  laura oh yeah thats right we can shoot at it  matt you can still attack from a distance its about a hundred now its 90 feet from you  taliesin ten points of damage  travis ill do the same thing ill throw some eldritch blast at it  matt go for it  marisha im still throwing rocks  sam ill shoot an arrow  matt yasha and beau are moving rocks make an athletics check /none/ for me  make an athletics check for yasha yeah shes good  marisha fuck 11  travis ill move my hex over onto it  sam 28  matt 28 hits  taliesin im also going to throw sacred flame at it  laura its not within range of sacred flame  taliesin oh yeah it is 60 feet  matt its not in range yet its 90 feet from you  travis 16 points of eldritch damage  sam 12 points of bolt damage  laura guiding bolt  matt roll for attack  sam oh no its /none/ getting closer i back up a little another five feet  matt all right thats as far as you can get youre up against the wall now  laura 13 points oh wait i didnt roll to attack im an idiot  matt you have to roll attack for that  laura oh that definitely hits 19 plus eight  matt yeah that hits  laura so that was 13 points  matt 13 points of radiant damage and its also glowing the next attack on it  has advantage it moves forward again it is now 70 feet from /none/ you  liam i said magic missiles but i dont have that prepared so im going to throw fire bolt at it  matt go for it  liam natural 20  marisha kill it with cantrips  matt thats the way to do it  travis one of those hits 21  liam 18 for me  matt 21 damage for you 18 from you  travis no sorry 21 to hit  matt 21 hits yeah and 18 damage  liam 18 total  matt all right its taking hits and slowly moving towards you it feels like /none/  the old 1950s scifi movie with the weird carrot looking creatures that these are  loosely based on visually this is like a dude in a suit trying to scoot it forward  they dont chase very well ropers  sam im going to carefully aim and fire a gun at it my pistol  matt okay go for it  travis before he fires 19 points of damage four necrotic  matt you got it  liam say goodnight grimace  sam it is disadvantage because its longer than 30 feet away right  matt but its advantage /none/ because the well no because you already used  the guiding bolt thats right  sam so it would be not great 13  matt theres a burst of powder and smoke youve never fired a firearm its still a  relatively new technology for most people outside of the main military and even then  theyve only been producing them out of hupperdook for the past ten years so your  first time really using this and yeah the ringings in your ears your hand  feels numb from the blowback not great it pings off of the front /none/ of it  travis i dont know what that is but i dont think you should use it no more  sam reload  laura is it within 60 feet of us yet  taliesin when do the insects get another attack thank you  matt now its 60 feet  laura toll the dead bong  matt a natural 20 on its save  liam everybodys in a line shaking their heads at this thing  travis two more eldritch blasts ooh natural 20  taliesin spare the dying oh wait sorry sacred flame  sam youre going to /none/ make it live  matt that is a 15  taliesin nope 16  matt yep roll damage  travis natural 20 and a 20  matt ooh so both hits one with a crit that first attacks a crit double  taliesin 15 points of damage  laura its getting really close so its going to be able to grapple us again very soon  matt very next round  travis 13 points of eldritch blast on the first one and 13 points on the second one  man thats so weird  matt okay mighty nein how do /none/ you want to do this  taliesin with vague interest  matt with vague interest its starting to loom forward blasting  travis no scoot no no  taliesin drop it  matt it goes limp it gets really tense for a second and then really sad and is  like okay its dead  laura yay  taliesin now that thats done im going to start doing a ten minute heal for whoever  who needs a heal  laura i need a heal  sam you were eaten by it  taliesin im going to start a ten /none/ minute while you guys dig  travis yashas pulling rocks fjords pulling rocks  laura i think they were a couple you guys  sam i think they were a couple i think they were married  laura i think theyve been living down here for a long time they were this wonderful couple  liam should we look for their babies  laura gasps little rock babies maybe thats why they were mad maybe the crystals we took  were their rock babies what if it was their giant baby nest and we broke their babies out  liam /none/ hows that tunnel coming  travis not fast enough  matt at this point in time beau and yasha have managed to pull enough rocks out of  that tunnel to make it large enough for each of you and fjord to squeeze through  you can step through each of you and eventually find yourself on the other side  the burrowed tunnel continues ahead of you into darkness  taliesin who needs healing by the way okay so just you two  laura i think were the only two that got hurt  liam need it a lot /none/  sam beau did you get hurt  marisha no  sam what are you doing over there  taliesin 12 points of healing  liam did i mention im a monk  laura then im going to cast cure wounds on myself as well at 2ndlevel  sam well we only have about another two weeks of walking before we get to xhorhas  laura yeah no joke  sam unless you make us a wagon with paint and also horses  liam and pavement  sam and pavement what about bicycles you could paint eight bicycles  travis /none/ nobody knows what that is  sam its a weird dream i had  matt strange gnomish engineering thats still in the early development stages  laura i dont think theres anything that would really help us down here that i could paint  sam do one of you magicy people have some way of next time we see a monster  instead of killing it we could command it to carry us or something  taliesin we could command it to carry us we could ask it politely to carry us  laura yeah i actually do have the /none/ ability to command things but they have to be able to  understand me and i didnt think that those rock things probably spoke our language  taliesin we never used the magic words to be fair  laura well you know we could have said pretty please  taliesin please thank you it gets you so far  laura you dont know i could try it  sam next time  laura next time  sam on we go  matt continuing down the familiar monotonous carved tunnel if youre  keeping the same order make your perception checks /none/ keeping a watch out front  liam dancing lights is up  laura ooh 24  matt nice you move on for the remainder of the day before getting to a point where  youre starting to get a little tired and you figure you can continue to push on if you  want to but youll begin to push into possible exhaustion territory youve now  hit what would be a full days worth of travel and this burrowed tunnel continues  on youve found one chamber and then passed it so at least you know theres  probably /none/ more to come in the level you are currently traveling in but this days  travel after that last encounter you have not found another chamber  marisha i havent seen any form of writing no offshoots nothing like that  matt nope but the good news is as long as you have this tunnel you know  at least youre probably on the right track  taliesin if you want i can stone shape i can push us in a  liam we can do the same  taliesin im going to carve a hole about the size of /none/ what we need so we can be  pressed into the wall  matt okay and the width of that is  liam oh its hold on a second  taliesin it might be too big for me to carve  matt i think it might be a bit large to carve the whole thing  liam i cant remember almost there tenfoot radius yeah  matt tenfoot radius yeah so you can carve part of it and itll still be partially exposed but  he can color it as he wants and with the stone itll help somewhat camouflage /none/ it  laura yeah nothing can get through it anyway  liam well repeat everything and i will send frumpkin up ahead of us 50 feet  to stay up all night as a guard to come running back in if need be  matt so you guys spend the evening another long rest  roll perception for frumpkin for the evening if you dont mind  laura im going to cast sending  matt okay  laura im going to cast sending for yeza im going to say its me again can you  let us know if youve /none/ been on the move or if youre staying in the same place  sam out of the tunnels  laura are you in the tunnels still  travis are you in the tunnels  matt theres a brief pause and then ah no they just have me in a room we havent  been traveling underground since we got out but they have me in the city now  laura whispers shit  sam whyd you say shit whats going on  laura hes already in the city were not going to be able to ambush them you guys  /none/ sam okay well well come up with another plan you guys are smart  travis yeah and there wasnt much of an ambush we could do anyway  its one way in one way out well be fine  marisha its more information which is always good  laura yeah  sam lets go to sleep so we can start early in the morning  matt perception for frumpkin  liam 17 for frumpkin  matt good to know the evening goes by frumpkin does notice throughout the evening some movement  through the tunnel a strange creature similar to /none/ what seemed to be the stalagmitetype roper  creatures who you had fought before but a little smaller scooting along the ceiling it made it  through the tunnel over top of you guys and then continued on without noticing or caring about the  location where you had placed and camouflaged your evenings rest the next morning comes to  you continue traveling all right keeping a watch out laura please as jester roll your  perception check its a long subterranean journey for me doing daytoday here im sorry  taliesin oof  sam barf  laura thats /none/ a bad one eight  matt okay you got a keen eye out there in front of you  laura sorry guys i rolled really well yesterday though  matt this day is the hardest so far because it is an entire eightplus hours of just  winding tunnel once again that continuous pace it seems to dip at times and then  it picks up it has its own organic shifting to it in small bits but it is a day of travel  of that same tenfoot wide continuous tunnel and it is maddening  laura singing 66 /none/ bottles of beer on the wall 66 bottles of beer  all singing take one down pass it around 65 bottles of beer on the wall  laura strained singing 21 bottles of beer on the wall  liam also all throughout the day once an hour caleb says its 200  sam shut up  liam an hour goes by  matt perfect  liam its 300  sam no  travis you know if youre going to do those maybe put some chimes behind them  so you can be like a bell tower  laura i use /none/ thaumaturgy every time he says it to make the bingbong noise  liam an hour later dingdong dingdong its 400  matt all right that days travel goes by uneventful so day three is done  do you guys set up camp once more here in the tunnel  laura same deal im going to send a message to yeza  matt okay  laura sme again  travis is sme one word s apostrophe me okay  matt i think so  laura how long were you in these tunnels do you know how do you feel  were /none/ on the way your wife misses you a lot she loves you  travis she loves  laura shit i thought that meant i used two i had three left shit she loves  matt she loves a lot  travis im roughly counting so i dont know  matt all you hear is i cant  laura oh no  sam what is that whats the oh no what is that thats even worse than  oh shit what is that  laura i just think somebody was he wasnt alone this time and he couldnt respond is all /none/  sam is he okay  laura yeah he just said i cant so i was like oh okay thats all  sam like i cant breathe i cant live anymore  laura no like i cant talk to you he basically said i cant talk to you right now im busy  taliesin i cant eat this i cant floss theres all sorts of things people cant do  laura i think he was in the middle of dinner  taliesin oh yeah i cant do all sorts of things when im eating  laura yeah itll be okay /none/ nott itll be okay  sam yes i know well find him  travis nott i have to say ive been feeling pretty bad hearing that you drowned previously  i want to apologize for making you face your fear over and over again no ive been giving you some  shit and as someone who has experienced the same thing i commend you for your bravery  sam youve experienced the same thing youve drowned  travis yeah  sam oh thats right  travis thats cool dont worry about it yeah  sam well you didnt know how /none/ would you have known  travis no but thank you all the same  liam you took a lot of courage to go in i was not very helpful in that regard either you did  not tell us what was going on why would you you still went in for a long time so sorry  sam no its all right im sorry that i wasnt more helpful in that earlier fight when i panicked  and didnt go in the water but its not so bad if youre down in the water with your friends  liam oh /none/ its nine oclock  sam fuck you  laughter  sam your people did this to me  laughter  matt so you settle in for your third evening here underground  laura im going to use a spell  sam i assume theyve been making food for us and stuff  laura yeah  matt i would hope so because your provisions are going to run out pretty quickly otherwise  laura sure weve been making food  taliesin yeah i had that spell set up sure  matt divine mac and cheese doesnt taste divine just is divine /none/  laura i cant do the spell i was going to do because i forgot i didnt have it prepared  but maybe tomorrow  matt maybe tomorrow so same set up evenings rest frumpkins keeping watch  go ahead and roll perception check for frumpkin  liam ah six  matt six okay good to know  travis oh fucking balls  matt as the evening goes on frumpkin doesnt notice anything  liam good cat  matt you wake up your fourth day begins you gather your things and begin to trek  even further into this single /dung/ perpetual tunnel  marisha hey guys im just saying if were going to be underground in a blank boring shithole  tunnel for a whole nother day i still have some of these mushrooms left over from mollymauk  sam it would pass the time  marisha might just help make it fun  travis wow really now  marisha im real bored  travis its super dark lives could be at jeopardy at any moment and you want to trip  laura yeah its true if those conehead thingys come out again i dont want  any of you /none/ not being aware of whats happening  marisha im just so bored  travis yeah  liam youre bored  marisha yeah  liam really look at this frumpkin gets up onto his hind legs and does a little  laughter  laura oh beau you know what we could do here take this im going to give her the  smutty book that you gave me just recently  marisha gasps  laura wait wait wait read it out loud  marisha okay  travis why do you do these things  laura now we can all have entertainment /none/ while were walking  sam its like listening to a podcast when youre driving to work  marisha it already starts good you guys it was a glistening night  travis oh crap no  marisha the snow fell on the winding paths  sam oh just like the path were on  marisha it was chilly she could feel her nipples getting hard  it starts so soon it starts so soon  laura i mean normally it doesnt take but  taliesin that was going right into it  travis constitution saving throw  matt this is just /none/ an overall penalty to stealth  laughter  travis is there anything on the ceiling as i awkwardly stare up at it  matt both you and jester both make perception checks  travis oh i was kidding but  marisha she felt the warmth of a fire she could feel his warm touch as it was grasping around  sam around what around her waist around her buttocks what  travis 17  marisha as his strong burly hairy arms wrapped around her waist she could feel  her breath leaving her bodice this is so good jester  /none/ laura i know thank you caleb  matt travis  travis yes  matt fjord at this point trying to ignore that and facing forward is continuing the path this  protracted tunnel you begin to notice smaller tunnels intersecting with it  travis like on the sides or  matt like one on the side one a little higher  travis up in front of us  sam while im listening to beau im going to fold my arms so no one can  see the shape of my nipples right now  laughter  matt all right  /none/ liam you know you are a very good reader you give it a lot of character  marisha stuttering thanks as she reached down  travis man i hate to interrupt but you know we have some divergent pathways ahead  taliesin how big are they  matt you look up and you can see they are maybe about two three feet wide each from what you can  see the entrance to the first one on the right thats on the right side a lot of dirt and rock  has been pushed into it its kind of closed /none/ off you walk up to the second one its a little more  up on the left higher range of it and you can see there are bits of stone and dirt that have  fallen out and created a small pile on the ground beneath it  travis yeah  liam do they bear any resemblance to the giant hole that we were following  matt no  travis hey you want to send that cat of yours about 50 feet behind us  liam oh behind us  laura do we hear anything coming from the tunnels  /none/ matt you who have been so distracted by the reading of the book hear nothing  travis it looks like two of those had stuff pushed into it  that one looks like something came out of it  taliesin wouldnt maybe if you were traveling these caves you wouldve capped them because of  things that kept popping out of the wall  matt caleb looking at this you figure these tunnels existed before this burrowing happened  and it looks like when this worm came through it tore through whatever these tunnels were  and pushed shit into /dung/ them and wrecked a little bit of this tunnel structure  travis that one came into this one though after the big guy came through  taliesin what  marisha thats funny that was exactly what was about to happen im sorry what  im going to i bookmarked it  travis caduceus go look up front jesus god  sam he cant see in the dark  taliesin ive got a light does it look like these were im going to go up to one  and examine it do i hear anything do i see any scrapings that /none/ would give a sign  matt make a perception check  taliesin its 15  matt listening in looking up there you dont see anything the one to the right  you dont see anything you dont hear anything  taliesin these markings on the interior  matt you do notice some markings quick little cuts in the dirt or stone  like hand or claw marks dragged across bits of it small  taliesin something burrowed  matt you see the pile of rocks and dirt that have fallen along the top you glance over and you can  /none/ see something somewhat shiny thats picking up the light from your globe  taliesin im going to clean it off a bit  matt it looks like a hammer but its not well taken care of per se your nose picks up a little  bit of the air here it smells somewhat rancid a little bit just a faint hint of rot  travis anything behind us  taliesin im worried about the things around us  liam how high off of the ground is that hole  matt its about ten feet up the whole tunnel is one /none/ big tenfoot side to side  taliesin im going to clear away a little bit more is there a body underneath this pile  matt no body  taliesin just a hammer  matt yeah just like a discarded tool  taliesin ill take a look at the hammer  matt its a hammer it looks like its seen a lot of use  travis why why a hammer  matt the metals wrecked a little bit in places and its been bludgeoned and misused  taliesin i think someone got grabbed  sam are the rocks around here dug /none/ out like someone was digging  matt make an investigation check  sam 28  matt they have been dug and you see signs that they were dug out by hand  and dug out by shovel or some sort of a tool used for digging  sam from above or from  matt from above and the side you get the sense that the one that opens up here connected to the  other one and this tunnel was burrowed in the middle and took out that connecting point  taliesin ive got a crazy idea  travis what /none/ that we can be under the ashkeeper peaks and these are mining tunnels  taliesin well no thats great thats way better  sam he just wanted to play parcheesi  laura what were you thinking caduceus  taliesin i think that this was some sort of pathway and maybe this closedoff  pathway here is possibly the way to go i dont know i feel like we might have  found a way of sneaking into where were going  sam sneaking in  marisha is there any remnants of precious metals coals things that would be mined  /none/ matt looking around here most of it appears to be carved stone and dirt  taliesin if anyone doesnt mind im going to pull out my shovel and start working on this  travis i think were dead under this mountainpeak right counting  were like taps  marisha weve got to be right  taliesin this blocked off path that this got bisected  sam so we could go up to get out if we wanted to get out  taliesin or we could go down this way because i dont think theres that much dirt in this  /none/ matt well the tunnel continues also its up to you guys  liam we can bail if we wanted to perhaps  marisha would i know the exact boundary line of xhorhas between the empire  do they use the mountains  matt the ashkeeper peaks are what divides the two sides of eastern and western wynandir yeah  travis might as well see where this thing goes we can keep going if we have to  sam we can go see the sun for a couple of hours get some vitamin d and then come back down  marisha /none/ if were under the mountains it could be a long way up and we dont know what those  mountains look like i mean i dont know it also could be fall and temperate and beautiful  travis there could be pigeons on the mountaintop  sam edible pigeons  travis is there another kind  sam no  laura i read scary books when i was little about these creatures that lived in the mountains that  were seethrough because they lived underground for so long but they had really long claws and  they would snatch up babies /none/  travis not helping  laura im just saying maybe we should avoid them  taliesin im going to start prodding to see how deep this cap on this bottom one goes  matt its a couple of feet deep and the rest of the tunnel goes beyond but for you caduceus  its a tight squeeze were talking bishop in aliens getting through the tunnel  taliesin im going to take a look in there do i feel any wind anything  matt no  taliesin its just stagnant air  matt yeah theres no breeze in here no /none/  sam if we go topside what are the possible benefits of doing that  liam well not going to xhorhas and getting murdered by far greater forces  sam were going to xhorhas  liam  but i think were going to xhorhas  sam we could go up and maybe find a horse or something and coax it down here to take us faster  taliesin a horse on the top of the mountain  sam i dont know if this miner fellow who was eaten alive left a couple of horses tied up there  taliesin why /none/ would he leave horses on top of a mountain  sam why would you bring them into the mountain you would leave them tied up on top  laura what if its not a miner from the top what if its one of the creatures that  i was talking about and this is his hammer and the tunnel actually  sam the worms hammer  laura no what if its a creature that lives in the mountain and hes got a hammer  and one of these tunnels leads to his village under the mountain and its a whole /none/ village  of scary people thats going to attack us as soon as we  sam caduceus cast talk to objects ask the hammer  taliesin what would you like me to ask the hammer  sam who was your owner  liam there is really only one reason to use the side tunnels  taliesin who was your owner  liam to leave  laura whispering to go poop because theres not really a lot of privacy  liam you can do that anywhere  taliesin the hammer is very obstinate but i would imagine thats expected of a /none/ hammer  im not going to say it wasnt worth a try i would have been surprised but  i would have been delighted as well  travis do we have any real positives for going up i honestly cant think of any  liam only if we wanted to give up which we are not doing so we go forward  marisha laughs okay heres the other thing though sorry im dying at the hammer  this is arguably going to lead to a nexus right like an entry point  taliesin yeah  marisha so whats on the /none/ other si did they build a military base around the entrance  to this tunnel system and is that what were about to walk into  sam if we go up  marisha if we go forward if we keep following this is it going to lead us  travis and taliesin theres no way to know  marisha yeah no i know i was just kind of throwing it out there  travis how far can frumpkin go  taliesin actually thats a good idea can we send frumpkin down one of these tiny tunnels  liam quite a /dung/ ways but if he gets too far away i no longer have the ability to communicate with him  travis how about just to that edge then  liam ja okay  taliesin cool  matt so you send frumpkin ahead  liam sure  matt roll a perception check for frumpkin in the dark so disadvantage on the perception check  liam ja but advantage with smell if theres anything stinky  matt okay good to know  laura wait wait wait i have an idea  matt whats your idea  laura what if i cast daylight we /none/ could tie a ribbon around frumpkins neck i cast daylight  on his neck on the ribbon and then he can see wherever he goes  taliesin i can cast light on the ribbon too so you dont have to burn a spell  laura hey thats better than that  taliesin i cast light on something tied to frumpkin  laura i take a ribbon off my horn and wrap it around frumpkins neck  marisha thats a good idea  liam put the ribbon on the backside so its not right in his eyes  matt you tie /none/ a little ribbon around frumpkins neck you cast light and now the ribbon gives off  this torchlight glow from the back of frumpkin  liam for the first ten seconds frumpkin goes  laughter  travis get it off  liam but gets used to it and then trots off  matt now roll a straight perception roll for frumpkin  liam i did i rolled twice so its a 16 perception  matt 16 okay frumpkin continues on 50 feet 80 feet about another hundred feet or so theres  another tunnel intersection its breached by this carving /none/ path then about another 130 feet or so  another chamber opens up this chamber is about 40 foot by 80 foot and the smell here is strong  frumpkin picks up on it smells of rot mildew feces its not a pleasant smell and there are  piles of refuse and furs and utensils and belts and odd objects that are thrown into piles here  you can see a number of other tunnels that all intersect into this area  liam is there any immediate reaction to a glowing cat entering into this big chamber  matt nope /none/  taliesin maybe roll back and try one of these smaller tunnels also  just to see whats a few feet down maybe  liam i cant hear anybody  taliesin i mean it seems like the thing to do  travis he cant hear us  taliesin what  laura oh caduceus  taliesin yeah  laura he cant hear us when hes doing these things  taliesin really  liam how many chambers are is it just many many  matt ten or so different tunnels lead into this chamber all ranging between  two feet wide to /none/ about three feet wide  liam im just watching i can no longer send commands i can only go along for the ride  to watch am i seeing anything like mining equipment  matt you see a small broken shovel there are piles of dirt bones coins looks like a lot of  things that have been gathered you can see warped pieces of wood that are partially  whittled and then abandoned in the moment stacks of a bunch of junk  liam okay  matt frumpkin hears a small growl and looks and in the farright corner /none/ theres a small cage  in the cage theres some sort of a furred creature no more than that big or so  thats missing tufts of fur and its in the cage going growling  liam okay i leave him there and come out of it  laura whatd you see  liam well its a good walk a ways and then there is a larger chamber with  many different exits to it and my good boy saw some sort of creature in a cage  laura how big of a creature  liam wuh  laura did /none/ it seem cute  liam hard to tell  sam you said theres a lot of entrances and exits to this place  liam yeah  matt theyre platforms the topography of the inside its not just a perfectly oval thing  it has a bunch of pieces of rock and stone and levels where these tunnels  are emerging and appearing  sam we know that the cricks have been making many attacks so maybe this is where they go  this is grand central and then they shoot off to different places to attack  liam or this /none/ is an old abandoned place you know i dont know what the right thing to do is because  if we keep following this tunnel we could roll right up into their backyard where they ended  their journey walk right into them however we dont really know where this place is going  we dont know how far it is from where your husband is going to be we dont know  what dangers are above us however we could come in and try to find him not walking directly  into their line of sight right into their /none/ face or their butt or whathaveyou  i dont know what the right thing to do is  sam i dont either  travis my two cents i think they did a pretty good job of closing up these tunnels right made  it so that the average joe or even someone ablebodied would be unable to follow them  i think this is probably the last place they think someone would come from  above ground pretty sure theyre covered  laura thats a good point fjord  liam that is a good point  taliesin i just wish /none/ we knew what these things were i would have loved to explore some of these  travis theyre small right theyre small tunnels  matt yeah  travis yeah i mean were already dealing with the twobodywidth tunnel as it is i dont want  to shrink it down any lower and really be fucked  taliesin my thought was we could send the cat up and down really quick and just take a look  travis send the cat  taliesin we have a cat we can just send down the smaller tunnel really quick  i dont know /none/ why we dont just take a peek  laura that is what were doing  taliesin we sent the cat down the big tunnel  matt yeah the cat continued down the big tunnel and found that other chamber the  tunnel continues past that chamber by the way  travis i thought the cat went up the small tunnel  laura me too  taliesin i had a funny feeling  matt no this was frumpkin going ahead on the tunnel you guys were traveling and found  that other chamber and the tunnel continues on the other side /none/ of this chamber  liam we didnt take the side with frumpkin just confusion thats fine  travis yeah lets send him up the small one thats what i was thinking  laura yeah bring him back  liam well he knows to come back in five minutes if he does not hear from me so we have to wait  matt yep frumpkin returns  taliesin id say the downward one just a quick look not too far down  top one quick look not too far up  laura yeah go down the little ones  matt frumpkin /none/ heads into the small side tunnel curves around about 20 or so feet and then it  opens up into another small chamber what frumpkin sees is a ten by 15foot opening area with a pile  of matted material like cloth it may have been at one point but its soiled you see two figures  sitting there one of them is in the process of fitting something together or pulling something  apart and the other is currently gnawing on some sort of a longdried bone theyre tiny humanoid  longer snout tails scaly skin i would say /none/ lizard or almost dragonlike but very tiny  theyre both sitting in there spears set to the side gnawing noises  liam about how far away from me has frumpkin gone at this point  matt about 30 or so feet  liam 30 or so feet snaps fingers pull him back i dont know  if they saw him or not he is glowing  matt and liam mmhmm  matt the last thing frumpkin sees is them go hiss  liam fwoomp little lizard people down that way and they saw my cat  laura cool  taliesin /none/ id rather them see us now than  travis ill run up and push myself up against the wall against where the tunnel is  just in case they decide to come out that way  liam i will take the other side of it and do the same thing  matt okay you guys all heading to split to the sides  taliesin yeah were going to fan out  travis do we hear any movement coming from the tunnel  matt you hear a snarling and you see a spearhead slowly emerge from the tunnel  and its /none/ head poke out ever so slightly make stealth checks guys by the way  because this is now going to see you  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us while we were hiding is that okay  matt ill say a straight stealth check on this one this happened too quickly  laura okay  sam may i use my cloak  matt yeah your cloak affects any stealth check you make for the most part  travis yasha rolled a six  matt cool  travis fjord rolled a 15  marisha 17  /none/ matt all right  sam caleb  liam oh a 17  sam 21  laura eight  taliesin 20  matt okay it pokes its head out sniffs looks right over towards fjord  and goes questioning chitters  travis i reach down and grab the spear and yank it out of its hands  matt yelling  travis what are you yells  matt the one behind it looks through and is like alarmed hiss and turns around  and runs down the hall and the one thats there is like panting  liam i pull out a /none/ small little stone pyramid in my hand and mutter a few words  and then cast tongues and speak to this little thing  matt all right well as youre casting the spell you hear the one that ran back  go like shouts of alarm  laura oh no  marisha oh jeez  matt you begin to hear this echoing sound of lots of claws scurrying their way  through the

days  marisha you were just lifting so many pebbles youll be great  travis 11  sam against a tiny little thing  matt no you grab its spear and it goes yell  travis fuck thats so embarrassing  matt and pulls it back from you as you hear the mounting skittering of numerous creatures now  coming from behind where you were and from the nearby tunnels what are you guys doing  liam wait /none/ just to specify from up where frumpkin just was from that direction  or multiple directions  matt multiple directions behind you  liam theyre in the honeycombs in the ceiling right  matt apparently  liam yeah  laura i cast disguise self and make myself look like a giant one of them  marisha oh man not again  travis we should run we should go  taliesin lets head to the tunnel then head to the main room  travis just run forward  marisha yelling  matt as youre casting the spell transforming into a larger /none/ kobold  you start rushing forward are you guys all heading forward with fjord  marisha i will head forward  liam mage armor  marisha  but power walking like a badass strolling behind in case  i want to deck some kobolds in the face  matt okay you guys charge forward around the corner into the next chamber that chamber has  about 20 or so kobolds that have emerged from or are in the process of emerging from the different  tunnels that are all facing your direction with small dinged blades and crossbows that look /none/ like  they might work spears and small leather and wood shields and they all fill the chamber  in front of you going chittering snarling theyre holding the line what are you doing  liam we have come to speak i say in whatever language i now understand and speak  taliesin im going to augment that  laura i act like im saying it  liam oh i made it very clear and held my hand  matt yeah theres definitely a confused division and attention here as theyre like chittering  travis world of magic and mystery /none/  taliesin they can all hear you  liam we have come through to chase a large serpent through these caves and eradicate it  matt the ones behind beau as youre strolling up and hes shouting this out there are about ten  or so kobolds that begin to rush up from behind and they see you and they slow their step and  start taking their spears and prodding you to join the rest of the people  laura also tell them that im their god  liam easy  matt theres one in the center of all /none/ of them that are there theres one that is covered in  cages and boxes and leather straps theres another that has heavy pieces of armor  almost weighing him down you see others that look like skirmishers that are all gathered around  and they all have this growling barking energy they look a bit hungry a bit sallow  and the one thats in the full armor steps forward towards you and you and is looking  back and forth and gives you this curious look  liam we are here looking for a scourge in these mountains /none/ oh boy  we mean you no harm we wish to pass through  matt grunts you hear him say in draconic come forth loud meal  travis nice draconic  laura oh man i was trying to make it look like i was talking caleb argh  matt there are a number that are staring at you in half awe like  travis deity  liam in draconic saying well through the spell i am one meal  but my friends can make more food than me i am  matt do you approach  liam i take two /none/ steps forward  matt all right make a dexterity saving throw  liam okay  marisha what why though  liam two steps forward thats an 11  matt as youre saying this with intensity and force you guys watch as suddenly theres a cloud  of dust around his ankles and a rope loop wraps and pulls your legs together and hoists you up  and youre now dangling about three four feet off the ground  liam i only take this as a minor setback we can still work this out  matt at which point all the /none/ kobolds theres this large wave of cackles  the one raises his hand up and they all get quiet and he goes  taliesin thats pretty funny  marisha thats pretty good  matt you loud food points at the rest of you  marisha youre just dangling  matt you want pass yep as your hair is just dripping there and youre slowly creaking  laura his coat up yeah  matt hes following you with this nasty looking shortsword that looks like the edges of it  are grimed up with black oil or something  liam you /none/ do not want to tangle with the spirits i command i snap my fingers and frumpkin appears  and four globules of light float in a circle around frumpkin  matt ugh takes a step back make an intimidation check  travis upside down  marisha beware the spirit of the maine coon  liam intimidation thats a 19  matt he who summoned kitty spirit  liam you will be cursed for decades  matt we already cursed  laura what does it say  matt you in no position you in that position so you give one to /none/ feed or trade for food  hes looking at you hes making this challenge to you but is definitely keeping a distance  and is taking a step back from where he was standing so confidently in your direction  liam you expect me to hand over one of my own  matt yes  liam this cat will burn you burn you all  laura he sounds very intimidating right now  taliesin i heard that right  matt yeah  liam no its in drac well i dont know im speaking through a spell so  taliesin oh /none/ yeah  matt looking at the specifics of tongues here  sam tongues  matt any creature that knows at least one language can hear and understand it  so its not so much that youre speaking draconic but any creature that knows  language can understand you so all of you hear this  liam so were all on the same page  matt yes  liam oh thats excellent  laura yay we can make food  taliesin we cant understand them but we can understand you  matt actually strangely enough its speaking in broken common  /none/ taliesin and laura oh  taliesin well i mean we can make some food i suppose or we can let the cat have his way  is there any way i can just add a thaumaturgy effect to the cat really quickly  matt how so what do you want to enhance  taliesin i want the ground around the cat to shake gently and start having  a minor earthquake effect  liam frumpkin stands and does that little  matt as frumpkin does that and the rocks shake and tumble around in this small quaking noise  about /none/ six of the nearby kobolds go gasping and start skitting away from it  holding their weapons at bay two of them in the tunnels all of a sudden go squeaking  and climb up in the tunnels and vanish  laura aww  taliesin we have food though  laura yes little mes we have food for you worship me i am your leader  matt make a deception check  sam i am your leader  taliesin oh lord  laura and taliesin ah  laura 12  matt you see two of them begin to reach towards /none/ you like excited breathing  laura yes  matt the one in the full armor goes no pay attention and slaps them  with his spear and they snarl  travis how about the food  laura we bring food for you  matt trade  taliesin well need containers do you have a couple of pots big containers  matt sybil points to one in there and you see this one kobold thats covered in rags kind of  looks like the collector lady from labyrinth and pulls out this large billowing leather sack  thats stained of all /none/ sorts of colors around its basis heavy breathing it holds it up its jaw  is slightly dislodged on one side and gives it this crooked grin to its face holds it open  taliesin do you have one more i can do two if youve got two i can do water also  do you care about water i can do water  matt we have water  taliesin thats fair  matt fill food  taliesin im going to take a little piece of fungus off the stick and im going to  put it in there and /none/ im going to start casting create food and water  and its going to suddenly become 45 pounds of food  matt thudding the thing all of a sudden slams into the ground the heavy weight from the  summoned meal hitting the heavy rock floor as soon as that kobold leans forward  pulled off of his feet and manages to stumble into it and look inside sniffs whoa  begins to shovel it the leader then goes stop we eat  taliesin and laura its good  matt two may pass more food for trade rest huh  /none/ liam the fey king is growing angry with you and the globules of light start to spin a little quicker  taliesin a little more thunder maybe  matt two and the fey king can also pass  laura what about the leader your leader can i go  matt you see the others all nervously looking towards the other and you can see him feeling  really intimidated by your presence theres this idea of him being the head of this sect and you  storming in here and hes just this jealous intensity as it stares towards you /none/ and goes  do not listen why you come  laura i came because im a really good friend of yours im a leader here  and also i just wanted to go through with my friends  matt false leader may go as well  laura yes  travis we have two gator skins in the bag of holding  matt what gator  travis yeah  matt what  travis are you interested in gator its like real tough leather  i mean bet you could use it as some  taliesin i dont think theyd be interested /none/ its way too nice for them  i dont think that they really  matt you can see four other mouths watering as youre describing this tough gator skin  taliesin thats so expensive and difficult to come by in this part of the world  travis i know yeah its so rare i mean maybe its better we just hold onto the gator  taliesin you dont want i mean we certainly dont want to give it up  matt give us gator skin  taliesin well  travis i dont know i mean i could maybe part with /none/ one for the rest of us  matt no all of it  travis well all right

and goes i think that is shh im making number  sam i /none/ can also offer you this i have a pouch of smoking tobacco you could smoke this  and it will make you forget your troubles  matt it leans forward towards you giving a look and goes you sniffs goblin  sam yes  matt make a persuasion check  sam jesus 17  taliesin wow  matt takes the pouch from you sniffs  sam no dont eat it its for

marisha i jump down and take out one of my shurikens and chop caleb free  matt thudding like a sack of potatoes  liam is that 1d6  matt from that height yeah that would be four points of bludgeoning damage  marisha ah jeez  taliesin im just making sure nobodys tried to ive been trying to keep an eye on things  laura yeah i dont want them ganking our stuff  taliesin nobodys tried to gank anything right  laura ive got my hands /none/ on our stuff the whole time  matt okay youre keeping watch and a few do get close and theyre definitely eyeing the various  trinkets that dangle from your belts but as any of them start getting close you grab and they pull  back the leader goes go follow path of big worm make big mess go  laura nugget come on  travis wait a path the big one  marisha make big mess  laura oh yeah question about that did you see how many of them there were with the big worm  matt just /none/ looking at you angrily this  laura the guys that made a big mess  matt big mess move

small though so in relation to them it may well be  laura thats true its kind of  travis ask them if theyve been all the way to the end of the  /none/ sam you can ask them  laura they understand us  travis have you been all the way to the end of big mess tunnel  matt no no go  travis why not  matt stay here home eat food from you  taliesin that is fair  liam do you know who is caged up aways down

cage  matt is food  laura no dont eat it  sam is it cute or not  matt its pretty ragged  travis are we going to pass judgment on this thing come on  lets just keep going and turn a blind eye  taliesin is the cage locked or is it just shut  matt from this distance it looks closed  sam if you rescue this thing could it be cute ever  matt with a little tlc maybe  laura i mean we shouldnt let it just die  matt youre /none/ not even sure what kind of creature it is it kind of resembles  a squirrel kind of resembles a small dog but its greasy and ratty and  sam trade your dog for it  laura im not going to trade nugget no  sam just trade nugget for it  laura no  taliesin are we going to be walking within 30 feet of that cage  matt most likely yeah  taliesin okay cool  liam i tell you what do

matt okay picks up the fey king from the scruff of the neck and goes you i eat gain power  bigger than that one false leader  matt and laura snarling  matt let go all of them pull back and begin to disappear into the tunnels behind and you guys  are given a path through  liam we have food the creature in the cage  matt the cage is just right there  liam i pick it up  laura lets /none/ open it up  sam and marisha take the whole cage  taliesin once the cage is within 30 feet im just going to pop it open with thaumaturgy  matt okay the creature immediately jumps out shrieks and darts off down the tunnel  marisha ah its rabies  laura yay its alive thanks caleb  taliesin bye buddy  marisha the thing is going to die in ten more feet from something else  taliesin its going to be like one of those youtube videos where they  let the mouse go in the forest and just the /none/ hawk like ten feet  marisha and travis yeah  matt you guys continue on the path  travis uhhuh  taliesin it didnt last one day  matt as youre leaving caduceus you notice that the leader leans over to two other kobolds  and whispers something to them  taliesin what do i hear  matt you hear a low muttering but not in a language you understand  taliesin thats interesting can your cat hear what theyre talking about  liam sure but im not zooming into him right now  taliesin no im going to walk /none/ by you and be like theyre talking about something  i dont know if we want to keep an ear out for what theyre up to  liam swoosh  matt so what was that  liam oh i just jumped into the fey king really quick to see if anything was happening  matt okay after you guys leave everyone scatters into the chambers but stays behind  and watches and two of the kobolds slowly begin to follow behind the group in the tunnel after you  laura yeah  taliesin cool  marisha lets let them do /none/ it for a little bit  matt one of them is the one thats covered in all the different boxes and pouches  theres a staff and it has an actual small cage like the one that you just opened on its side  with something inside it the other one just looks to be a small spearholding scout  and theyre both being quiet as they can but the one carrying everything isnt very quiet  sam theyre on our tail  matt caduceus you can hear the gentle clanging of various accessories of this kobold  trying to /none/ be quiet pursuing you down the tunnel  taliesin as long as theyre keeping some distance  sam want me to take them out or at least  taliesin not yet  sam disarm them  liam lets lead them away from the pack  marisha they might have useful information  laura theyre so cute  travis i dont think thats accurate  sam they both have weapons  matt well one of them is just covered in  travis shit  matt random shit the other one has a spear you travel for about an hour or so /none/ away from  that the tunnel continuing before you theyre still staying back by about 60 or so feet  marisha oh so theyre not even being secretive about it  matt and marisha they think they are  travis theyre watching us leave theyre escorting us out  marisha got it  taliesin i think at some point whens the point where its time to bed down  are we getting to that point  matt id say youre probably within another hour or so of that  taliesin i think at some point were going to bed down /none/  travis mmhmm  laura mmhmm yeah  taliesin i think thats a great idea  laura yeah and then well go to sleep  taliesin and then well go to sleep  sam go to sleep  laura mmhmm good idea  matt all right so you guys eventually reach that point and you begin to bed down what do you do  taliesin im just going to i think we should  laura put on a show i think they need some entertainment  travis mmhmm  laura yeah  marisha you mean like as in projecting hey /none/ we should go to sleep like that  laura yes oh im feeling so tired  marisha my feet they hurt  laura also im not a giant lizard anymore im not a big kobold im me again  marisha

each other im going to turn invisible  matt okay  travis there you go  sam and /none/ im going to sneak back there  matt okay  sam back towards them  matt do you guys lay down what do you do  laura i walk around dramatically for a while  travis is the dome out are we summoning the whole thing  matt is the dome out or are you waiting  liam i have not done that yet  marisha ill try to look for

mmhmm /none/  matt okay you see the two of them around the bend are both looking and the one with the spear  is looking kind of eager the one with all the shit on it is looking a little apprehensive  and theyre both just watching and talking back and forth kobold speech  liam is nott out of our sight  matt yeah nott vanished a few minutes ago  sam im going to try to sneak up on the one with the spear  matt all right  sam and get close to he or she and grab /none/ the spear out of their hand  matt okay go ahead and make a i would say with advantage  make an athletics check to try and  sam 20  matt seven the spear vanishes from its hand  sam ill throw it the opposite direction down the tunnel away from us  matt confused kobold noises he looks confused and rubs his wrist and starts walking  back towards the spear on the opposite side  sam then while he or she is going to get their spear im going to try and grapple the weird one  /none/ the one thats all weird and shit  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  sam oh not advantage  matt i would say advantage because it doesnt know youre there ill allow it its fine  sam okay 19  matt 19 okay if youd like to describe your kobold

thank you very much  sam what we were specifically told  travis not playing  all not playing  marisha just visiting  chris this is a house of lies  laughter  taliesin oh my god  chris no peeking  taliesin no peeking  matt so suddenly out of nowhere apparates in the nervous energy of the moment  the /none/ small goblin creature that youve been eyeing nervously as the group  wandered through and it just reaches out and grabs a hold of you  chris ah mommy mommy  sam yeah i am your mommy yeah deal with it  chris so this kobold has hes got flasks hanging off him by ropes and you can see  that these flasks are basically just stoppered gourds and theyre clattering  and banging together hes got a basket of swarming centipedes slung over his back  sam open  chris no its also closed off almost like a closed /none/ off net of centipedes  sam ugh  laura oh my god  chris with a rope attached to it and then there is a clay pot hanging from that  that has an acrid smell rising from it and another clay pot tied to a rope thats lashed  around his shoulders his weapon is a staff with a living scorpion tied at the top of it  sam caduceus where are you when i need you  chris its little tail jabbing at the air and the cage holds a creature  that you recognise as a skunk /none/  travis this fucking  taliesin this is chemical warfare man  chris the worst is tied to this stick with the scorpion on it is a bag that is buzzing  loudly like its full of hornets  sam hey bees  laura hey bees  matt so as you hear this sudden clattering commotion and both this kobold voice  screaming out mommy and nott going yeah mommy the other kobold down the way goes  panicked kobold yelling and runs off to grab the spear you guys hear this noise  what are you two doing  /none/ sam im going to oh you two meaning me and chris  matt yeah whats your reaction  chris i am trying to take my stick and hit him with the scorpion  matt go ahead and make an attack  travis little scorpion on the end of the stick  chris little scorpion  travis please hit  chris that is a what is that  taliesin that i believe is in fact a  laura a natural 20  taliesin i think thats a natural 20  laughter  taliesin yeah that is thats your old keyleth die /none/ too ive never seen it roll one in my life  chris so it stings you on your eyelid pfff  sam ah  travis yeah best place  chris you take one piercing damage and have to make a constitution saving throw  matt so two piercing damage with the crit  chris oh sure i like it yeah two  sam con save 21  chris okay you succeed and take half of this amount of damage which is  liam 79  matt technically the dice damage is doubled because its a crit too so its just /none/ straight damage  chris oh right yeah double poison damage shit so that will be seven points of poison damage on you  matt the eye immediately swells up from the impact and youre like ah  just spinning around in a circle the one with the spear rushes up like ergh  cant quite figure out where to go what are you guys doing  taliesin im going to get up  liam walking towards the noise ja  sam ive got one  matt you rush around the corner and you see this whirling whirlwind of clattering pots /none/ and cage and  goblin and kobold screaming anyone doing anything or are you just watching  laura im going to cast command  matt all right  laura at second le no yeah second level and try to get both of them and say stop it  sam youre commanding me too  laura no both of the  matt gotcha  liam the second one ran off down the hall a bit  laura yeah but its still within range  matt all right so its wisdom saving throws  laura yes wisdom saving throw  matt go /none/ ahead and make a wisdom saving throw if you dont mind  liam and simultaneously i am casting enlarge on nott the brave  matt okay so  chris i rolled a 14 minus two is 12  matt 12 17 minus two which is 15  laura they both have to stop it  matt so immediately the one holding the spear looks at you huh and you find yourself  all of a sudden stop struggling and weapon freezes in place at the same time the tiny  goblin arms around you suddenly hulk out and you find /none/ yourself lifted off the ground  your legs dangling a

that shoots centipedes on me  marisha no thats exactly what he said  chris then you /none/ hear this sound pthwoing  marisha do you have bug allergies oh no  travis panicked screaming  marisha have

clattering to the ground  taliesin thats really neat  laura thats really cool  marisha it works its amazing  taliesin aw man  sam thats ingenious  matt at which point the enlarge spell fades /none/

noises  chris i beat it with my stick  matt okay  laura no dont beat it poor pepé  matt the other kobold has fled it saw the running fjord centipede nightmare and just left  travis as fun as that was you know instead of killing this adorable little guy  maybe we could enlist him as a scout or guide  sam do /none/ you know these tunnels at all have you explored since the worm came through  chris yeah  sam what was that what did you just do  matt still hitting the skunk  travis stop no hey hey  laura stop hitting it  sam dont beat your skunk  chris i put it back in its box  liam yeah i have a question for you my little friend do you eat enough  under your current leadership  chris no  liam we will keep your belly full if you travel with us you will have never /none/ eaten so much  in your life but we do need a guide down here and you could be that guide  chris shouting im very quiet tie off the cage sling it over my hornets  tie them back to my staff  taliesin if it gets us to where we need to be id be willing to drop another spell  laura yeah  taliesin another 45 pounds whatever we dont need of that 45 pounds which is an awful lot of food  travis i think youll have no trouble finding your way back how far down /none/ this tunnel  have you ventured before spurt  chris i point back the way we came about 60 feet  travis oh shit brave new world  liam oh that is less appealing  sam but youre quiet and you can stealth right you snuck up on us very well  taliesin is that a bag of bees youve got over there  laura oh hello bees  chris ive got plus zero is that high  sam sure  chris here are my bees  taliesin and laura hi bees  liam not the bees not the bees /none/  laura hey spurt how long have you lived down here  chris 11 days  laura 11 days  sam how long do kobolds live  chris 11 days  laughter  travis oh god this is it the swan song  liam and in your 11 days what is the worst thing you have ever seen down here  chris my brother got eaten by a green slime  marisha wait like the green slime you have right there in the  chris yeah thats the one  marisha oh okay  laughter  travis oh my god /none/  sam do you like it down here do you want to come with us  chris where else is there  sam theres other places  chris really  sam yes theres light and other terrain  marisha would you like to follow us towards the light at the end of the tunnel  taliesin oh my god  chris okay  laura except were leading him to a really scary place yall  sam we dont know that we dont know xhorhas might love kobolds  liam plus hes near the end of his life we might as /none/ well show him great things  going to eat better than he ever has we could let him look at the dodecahedron  laura we shouldnt pull that shit out  liam or leave it in the bag im just kidding forget it thats a bad idea  laura that could be a really bad idea caleb  liam its funny but its not wise  travis we should keep going  laura yeah you want to come with us  chris yeah  laura hey this kid thinks youre his mom  sam thats super duper sad right now /none/  taliesin way to bring the whole room down  marisha im dying i am dying  liam dd happiness and sadness tied together  matt laughing all right so whats the marching order  sam spurt 30 feet ahead  matt all right  chris i walk with my staff out so stingy is actually in the lead  matt got you so youre leading with your scorpion perfect spurt continues forward  do you guys follow  travis marisha and taliesin yeah  matt all right spurt roll a perception check for me  chris something around heres /dung/ stinky  liam this is the best this is the best  taliesin wow  matt laughing okay  chris hey its dark down here  taliesin yeah this is going to be great  travis laughing its dark down here not good not good  matt continuing on for the next few hours getting slowly used to the smell of kobold  especially a movinghoarder of a kobold the tunnel continues to curve and it goes down a  little further then it evens out and goes down a little further then evens out you get pretty  late /none/ into the day before you begin to notice the rock and stone having some slight changes  the general bits of materials that youve been used to seeing down here the heavy gray and  brown rocks occasionally you see flecks and glimmers that your passing light puts  a shine across you go over and inspect it and it is a black glasslike substance  marisha is it obsidian  matt its obsidian you continue moving forward and theres more sections of it and you can see  where bits of it are broken and flaked off where the /none/ worm was burrowing through and battered  through a section of obsidian that then shattered  taliesin if theres any way to scoop up a couple of pieces  matt yeah definitely you gather up a bunch of obsidian shards a lot of it is broken and  brittle but there are some larger bits that you can find that are pretty jagged really you see  them first so you gather what you want  chris oh im too busy eating the poop out of my skunks cage  matt there you go  marisha goodberries  matt hey /none/ guys kobolds have ecology down  chris nothing goes to waste  liam its like a dune suit man you cant let that shit go to waste  matt exactly  liam reduce reuse recycle  marisha stop i just got better  matt im just saying none of you has a weapon that feeds you the air gets steadily warmer and  warmer as the hours pass and the floor itself begins to give way from the softer dirt and dust  with loose pebbles to become a harder more porous rock and the obsidian begins to become more /none/  apparent and more consistent you spurt begin to see a dull light ahead a dull low red light  chris perception zero  matt and sam yeah  chris light i see the light i run toward it  laura can we see what it is  matt it looks to be the tunnel coming to an end for some sort of chamber youre too far away to  make out any details but it looks like there is a room beyond it that has a dull red glow to it  laura oh no spurt dont run  /none/ matt you just run out  chris yes  matt you guys see spurt run out the temperature here is getting warmer and warmer as you progress  youre starting to find yourselves sweat uncomfortably you rush out into an open field of  rock like hewn carved rock floor like a courtyard if you will its about a hundred feet  or so across at first glance across the way there is a wall or portions of a stone wall built  into parts of an obsidian and stone cliff face or the interior of a cavern you look /none/ on the inside  and in this brief instant you take in the vicinity through your kobold eyes this large  chamber that continues on far to your left to the right is at a very steep incline an obsidian  wall where a pouring river of molten magma is coming down into a trough that goes across this  open chamber this river of lava with a bridge that goes across it to the opposite side to the  left there is a very interesting massive black iron citadel that sits maybe a quarter mile to  the left /dung/ of you at the peak of it and this is a very large chamber dozens of thick heavy black  chains affixed to its peak drape off and connect to the odd corners of this large cavern this is  far to your left youre in a small side courtyard on this side as you stop and look around  laughs hilariously unnoticed by the two massive fire giants that are currently playing sentinel  theres one across the way leaning against the wall standing at roughly 18 to 20 feet tall dark  gray skin what little bit of /dung/ red hair you see peeking from underneath its armored helmet as  its wearing heavy dark armor covered in spikes metallic thorns one hand is holding a tower  shield roughly its full height also covered in spikes in the front with another shield just like  that thats leaning on the wall it looks like its currently spacing out for a moment looking  back towards the citadel to the immediate left of you on this side of that molten river you see a  female fire giant wielding a giant maul who is in the process of picking /none/ her teeth with some sort  of pointed bone and neither have noticed you strangely they rolled really shitty  liam you said citadel we are seeing a fortress down here  matt you guys arent seeing this you just see the kobold rush out  liam okay  matt so what do you do spurt  chris how far away is the closest one to me  matt the closest one to you is about 20 feet to your left  chris i throw my wasp nest in a bag at it  matt okay  travis yes  /none/ matt roll for attack on it or is it a saving throw on their part  chris i throw the bag into a fivefoot square within 20 feet of me and it bursts open  into a swarm of wasps with 11 hit points  matt spurt runs out turns and ah impact buzzing the giant goes grunts and slaps  chris you dead you dead  laura i love him  taliesin oh no  travis please have some real armor  matt 22 to hit against you  chris laughs okay  matt you take  travis remember /none/ that number kids  28 points of bludgeoning damage  chris i win splats  matt you watch as spurt turns after throwing this and then a giant hammer slamming  squishing gallaghers spurt across the stone floor of this open way  laura and sam no  travis i run to the side of the cavern wall and lean up against it and shrink down  chris a little green slime seeps out underneath the hammer  matt the hammer lifts up and you see the stringy mess that was once spurt detaching from the hammer  sam my /none/ boy he was my boy  travis shh shh  matt everyone make a stealth check here  liam caleb starts walking slowly back through the entire walking formation  matt your work is done here  cheering laughter  travis holy fuck  sam he died as he lived as a spurt  matt thank you chris  laura what are we rolling stealth  matt stealth check  marisha we fulfilled our end of the bargain i feel okay  taliesin that happened  liam that spurt was quick but potent  matt no pass without a trace /none/ was not cast  marisha were stealthing  natural 20  taliesin singing natural 20  liam well fuck yall because i rolled a two  sam 23  liam thats a four for me  travis 23 natural 20 19 and yasha rolled an 11  laura i rolled an 11  taliesin natural 20  matt oh wow okay  laura should i be rolling stealth checks for nugget  sam is that dani  taliesin i just heard dani break in the other room  liam theres a delayed reaction out in the lobby  taliesin the /dung/ delay is the best  travis is that the quickest weve ever had a player character come in and die  taliesin oh yeah  matt as you guys all pull to the sides you hear heavy stomping a hand reaches down and rubs it  through the smear that was once the kobold and rises up a couple of pieces plopping into the  stonework then the light goes dark as the giants head bends down and one giant eye peeks  through the tunnel in your direction  taliesin is it on its way down into the tunnel /none/ how big is this tunnel again  matt the tunnel is ten feet wide the giant is going to have a hard time it could probably get  in there if it crawled right now its leaning down and looking inside  taliesin lights are dimmed  travis yeah were pressed flush  matt it glances around inside bends its head inside and its completely engulfing  the entire exit  grunts backs out of the tunnel and then steps to the side  you guys just barely fucking made that  travis thank you two natural 20s  matt /none/ you hear it shout something in giant any of you guys speak giant  taliesin yeah  matt you do thats right  sam because hes a what  matt because of his background his race  liam because hes so awesome  matt its not a secret its actually one of the languages that you get as a  sam its secrets  matt sure enough  taliesin i was once a giant there we go carry on  matt there you go what you hear is speaking giant you recognize it as be careful looks  like we /dung/ got rodents you guys hear on the opposite side the one that was laying with the  shield sits up for a second and takes the shield walks over to the river of lava scoops up some of  it and pours it across the top of the shield its like a pachinko machine the lava fills the front  of it on the inside theres a pocket and where once there was just dark iron shield now is  heating up and the shields have a fiery exterior to them after it fills both the shields it holds  /none/ both of them gets back to its position and theyre both looking around  liam does caduceus see that or everybody  matt you guys who are off to the side can glance over and watch this happen  its across the way you have no idea what the other giants doing but this one is across the way  and is visible from your position  taliesin they think there are more kobolds coming  laura how are we going to get out of here  marisha and where are we  sam do we see into the chamber /dung/ across on the other side its not a chamber its huge right  matt it looks you would guess probably a hundred or more feet across to the other side  but there is a wall there make a perception check  sam im terrible at this five  matt its hard to see from this distance  travis caleb you ever read about anything like this  liam have i ever read ive read a lot about fire giants under the earth yes  travis yeah crazy dark oh you have  liam ja my grandmother used to keep /dung/ me up late at night reading me stories about  things like this no i dont know anything i dont know  travis no dark citadels i mean this is an accident right  this isnt where were trying to go  liam i know about the history of the country i grew up in not about underground fortresses  laura ooh you know what we should do we should mark this on the map  liam lets put a pin in that and get back to it  travis yeah well get back to that  taliesin in a /none/ map should we mark this on the map then with a pin  liam i was speaking in metaphor  taliesin oh yeah i like those  sam what do we do we can sneak in we can create a diversion  laura we could create a diversion hold on let me see what kind of spells i have taken  sam but then to what end were going to run in there and do what  travis how far from the opening of the tunnel that were at off to the left  are both of the fire giants /none/  matt make a perception check for me to take in the details of the scenery  travis natural 20  matt no shit okay not only as you lean forward and poke through really assess the scene  ill just pull out the map and show you because you rolled a natural 20 ill be right back  travis got to love those critical role dice  marisha so attractive so sexy  liam perkins you are such a fun player jeez  travis you chaotic motherfucker how much shit can i throw on one person  liam such /none/ a 180 from shale when you were here the last time  matt heres where you guys are this is the tunnel because you rolled a natural 20 you can  see on the other side a continuation you gather that when the kryn traveled through they probably  had to make their way through this chamber and you gather from the surrounding and the vicinity  the obsidian was probably a difficult thing to pass through for this worm and probably  why it was forced to briefly make its way through this courtyard  travis what is this /none/ where the fuck are we  sam do we think that the kryn went through and were allowed to pass  laura i bet that these people are posted here because the kryn came through  matt thats an interesting observation  travis i think diplomacy will be our best tactic lets use words  sam lets offer them some food  travis yeah it worked well before and the other fire giant  sam is that the splatter of dead spurt  matt yeah thats where spurt met his end  sam here lies spurt  travis the second /none/ fire giant is on this side of the molten river of death  matt right there  travis uhhuh one  matt then thats the other one on the opposite side  travis thats a fire giant i thought that was the citadel  matt no the citadels way that way  travis those are shields  matt yeah  laura oh yeah you cant see the actual figure  liam yeah thats a dude double fisting full on  travis this the worst american gladiators course ever  laughter  travis hes right next to where we need to /none/ go its a big problem  sam pugil sticks  matt theres laser and target and youre going to fight fucked  travis fire shield magma shield  laura so potentially okay i have an idea what if caleb you make your bubble then one of us  just yells out to the fire giants hey we just want to pass through we dont want to have  anything to do with you were just chasing down these dicks that passed through your land  thats it then we hide in your bubble so that they cant attack us  /none/ sam then they know we are here  laura well yeah but what are we going to do we cant all be invisible and theyre right here  travis what happens after they attack us in the bubble  taliesin how much can the bubble take  laura they cant get us through the bubble  liam maybe they will go to sleep eventually maybe we can come back a little later  laura you dont think theyre going to have other sentries posted when they leave their post  travis yeah i dont know about the bubble thing  /none/ taliesin i can throw my voice if we have to  travis what if it breaks what about when it expires  laura im just saying in the tunnel its just an extra bonus of being in the  tunnel and extra protection or something  sam we could have it there in case we need to retreat  liam yeah if we are crazy enough to start a fight with these two  laura which i dont want to do i just want to talk to them  liam but if we do the bubble is a good idea /none/ although i have to stay in the bubble  for the bubble to be in effect  travis nonfighting options i can take one person with me 90 feet in a single direction  taliesin i can also make my voice i believe come from wherever i like within 30 feet  marisha i mean use a distraction get them looking at something else  taliesin just to have a conversation with these guys see if theyre willing to make a deal  sam jester can get across the entire span  laura yes i could do it  sam /dung/ i could turn invisible i could create a diversion  marisha i am a great sprinter like real good 100 meter dash  sam sure  marisha right just saying  taliesin i can get across  travis i could create a false diversion thats a massive beast in the opposite direction of us  or i could make a real beast  laura yeah can you make it look like  it comes from the cave and then runs off  so that it doesnt appear out of nowhere  marisha which cave our cave  laura or the /dung/ other cave maybe no i dont know  sam or just emerge from the lava  laura or just come out of the lava  marisha ooh lava monster  liam what about this what if fjord does that distraction we talked about across the fire  you banished that stone creature i know how to do that as well if you and i both  take a shot at the one on our side one of us maybe will succeed  taliesin if i hit it with bane beforehand it would also have a slightly harder time doing that /none/  laura oof but it could also succeed against us and then well have to fight a giant i think it  would be better if you know i could dimension door with you caleb over to the other side  liam and  laura and then we just keep going we never engage with these fucks  sam wait what about us what about the rest of us youre just going to leave us  laura well hes going to make a big distraction and then we all run  taliesin i have a sneaking suspicion that theres probably /none/ these giants are fast  faster than we are probably with some range  marisha would i know anything about giants reading up on them or anything  matt go ahead and roll a history check for me  marisha cobalt 19  matt they generally live beneath mountain ranges and areas of heavy volcanic activity they are  considered the artisan crafters and forgers of giant kin and the ordning they have theyre evil  travis oh they both are  matt no thats just giants  marisha so probably not amicable or prone to negotiation  matt they /none/ can be if it suits them well they enjoy free labor so they like to  take slaves to force to do the menial tasks  marisha and they craft things so theyre not stupid  matt no theyre intelligent like an average being would be  marisha averagely smart  matt from what youve heard you dont have a whole lot of knowledge necessarily  you havent heard of tales of the great crafty intelligence but nevertheless  they still built this entire underground city  marisha yeah i read this tome once in the library but i was /dung/ a little distracted  when reading it because the monks had also drawn a bunch of dick and dudes putting  horns up their butts in the margins it just happens yeah  laura shut up wait which library was this  marisha in the cobalt soul  sam focus  travis i have a suggestion i can make a manticore appear run from the cave and leapfly  over the river and carry off in the direction that is opposite of where we need to go  laura yeah then we all run  sam is this a real /none/ manticore or is it an image of one  travis it sounds and looks like a real manticore but if you make contact with it its just an illusion  liam while they are all debating this i channel a little bit of transmutive energy into my  stone and change its focus from constitution to fire resistance for myself  travis so you can go invisible you can go the entire distance youre fast as balls  laura go the distance  travis calebs fast as balls  taliesin i can briefly go invisible but not for this whole /none/ run  liam not today i didnt study that last night  travis i can take one person with me  laura can you get that far too  travis with one person  taliesin mister caleb is the one to go  sam what about yasha  laura somebody take caleb ill take yasha  sam you cant take yasha  laura why  sam shes bigger than you  matt theyre both medium sized  laura yeah shes not large  travis whos the odd man out who doesnt have a way to get over there real quick /none/  sam i can run and im invisible  marisha how fast can you run youre pretty fast  liam yeah its you two you are the quickest  taliesin i can be invisible for one run for one action  travis how long is your speed  taliesin i can get 60 feet  laura i could blessing of the trickster you here and that way youre a little  more stealthy as youre going  taliesin oh i mean ill be invisible until im visible  travis nott how do you feel about  laura i could polymorph /none/ someone  sam into what  laura into something that you know—  sam dragonfly  laura yeah that can get across i could polymorph i could polymorph you  and i could dimension door me and yasha  travis sure okay  matt you hear this heavy smacking sound as the fire giant on your side of this courtyard  is putting to bed the rest of the bees that have been harrying its kneecap  travis caleb do you have a plan  liam a plan  travis to get across  liam im the odd man out /none/  travis im asking  liam no there are many things i could do but i did not do my homework last night  that would facilitate those things  sam are you going to bamf with him werent you going to dimension door  laura one of us needs to take yasha one of us needs to take caleb  travis im taking caleb  laura ill take yasha  travis youre running balls youre invisible  sam how far can you go  travis 90 feet  sam that is not across the way that is just to /none/ the other side of the bridge maybe  laura i thought you could go farther than that fjord thats not as far  travis it would be pretty close were going to send both of them in the opposite direction  marisha are we dashing partners me and you  sam yeah  marisha all right  travis yeah we dont do any of this until they fucking move away from where we need to go  ready  marisha i like it  laura wait how about i take caleb the entire distance you and yasha bamf 90 feet /none/ and run  because caleb is squishy  travis sure sounds good i like it  taliesin should i be invisible at the beginning or at the end  laura do you want to be polymorphed  taliesin i can be invisible for 60 feet  laura okay well i wont be able to polymorph you once youre out  taliesin ill polymorph then i guess  laura do you keep your intelligence when youre polymorphed  travis heres the order youre going to polymorph caduceus youre going to go invisible  and get started im going to set the /none/ diversion and then we start going  marisha and then were going to go okay  sam do you need me to do anything to make the diversion look even more realistic  travis i dont think so  sam because i could  liam jester bring the haversack over open it up so that beauregard can focus on the mote of possibility  laura here beau  marisha is that bad is that going to send stuff to okay  laura dont take it out just let it in  liam just look into the bag just like huffing /none/ gasoline  marisha deep inhale  sam oh youre huffing literally right now  matt okay you take a moment and focus on the dodecahedron  travis you are doing that  laura and liam its in the bag  matt you take your fragment of possibility  liam beauregards face goes into another dimension for a moment  sam you got silver paint all over  laughter  marisha okay  laura okay im going to blessing of the trickster you youre still super stealthy  i dont know if it matters  sam jester  laura what  /none/ sam it was so wonderful having nugget around  laura nuggets just going to run out and hes going to blink and blink and blink as far as he can  sam hes going to be fine  laura yeah hes going to be fine  taliesin im also going to add resistance to you so you can add a d4 to any saving throw  for the next 60 seconds  laura it gives you advantage on stealth checks  taliesin you can add a d4 to any saving throw  matt all right  travis i turn to /none/ yasha and say when i give you the signal you and i are going to run  towards the river of magma and hold on tight  taliesin oh boy  matt you guys are over on this side here  sam this is going to go so good  taliesin this is going to go great its a great plan  sam mighty nein we have to do this for the memory of spurt  taliesin who  sam for spurt  laura he was so cute  sam the kobold who was just introduced to us and killed /none/  laura okay what should i make you what do you want to be  taliesin i dont know man there are so many options what would be fun i dont know  laura maybe a dragonfly could be really cool  taliesin i mean dragonflies are pretty cool  laura and taliesin yeah  laura okay well if youre a dragonfly will you remember what youre supposed to do  taliesin well i dont know but to be fair im not sure if i remember  what im supposed to do anyway  matt while you guys are working /none/ out the specifics im going to grab something real fast  keep talking amongst yourselves  laura if you cast polymorph if i were to cast it on myself i would remember what i was doing  liam yes you keep all your thoughts look theres the creative lead  of dungeons  dragons over there  taliesin who would be like um actually  liam you take all the stat adjustments except for your brains in there so all your decision making  is the same but dexterity saves and stuff thats the creatures stats right  travis but /none/ nuggets like in your pocket right  laura no sprinkles in my pocket  sam doesnt everyone have the creative lead of dd next to them when they play a game  taliesin you get the limited edition from the local store you know  laura i actually have a question matt  matt yes  laura when i dimension door i can take another creature  matt yes  laura does that mean i cant have sprinkle on me or else i wont be able to take caleb  matt correct  laura okay im going to take sprinkle /none/ off out of my hood okay beau take care of sprinkle  taliesin its on you  laura no its okay sprinkle just hold onto him when you run okay dont let him get left behind  marisha cant he do hes more magical than i am  laura its sprinkle hes my weasel  marisha oh  liam just imagine if jester had teleported away and went with sprinkle and caleb is just going uh  matt i love it  laura nuggets going to blink blink blink  taliesin im going to hide probably in your pocket im /none/ going to hide on you as the dragonfly  marisha okay im a onewoman petting zoo lets go  travis three two one  laura polymorph  sam invisible  matt so what order are we doing this guys  laura polymorph  sam invisible  matt so youre polymorphing caduceus into what  laura and taliesin a dragonfly  travis get your head start both of you  matt ill say for the purposes of that well say this is you  marisha youre hitching a ride on me  taliesin im going to hitch a ride on you /none/  matt all right the dragonfly jumps onto beau beau is now in the position to hold—  travis youre not just going to fly across the room by yourself  taliesin shes faster  liam beauregard is now noahs ark  taliesin you are the mighty menagerie  travis beau and nott im going to give you 15 seconds before we start  sam i think we should start with the monster  travis its your call  sam because if i go out there and trip the jig is up  travis are you going to trip  /none/ laura plus its expecting something to come out the door  travis all right fine i will use major image and i will cast the image of a manticore  climbing out of the magma river on this side of the bank roaring at the fire giant  and then leap flying over to the other side  matt okay  taliesin thats epic  sam jar of peanut butter get ready for a dick  laughter  matt out of the molten rock wings growling the manticore begins to rise both of the giants  look confused towards it /none/ and then each other the one with the shields braces the shields in front  the other one looking off to the side goes and reaches off to one of the boulders off to the side  and grabs it as it picks it up those at the front can see the rock seems to heat up there  are veins of heat on the inside as it grips it so you create the effect this is major image right  sam major image visuals and sounds  travis visuals and sounds  matt yes all right theyre both going /none/ to look forward towards it to

laura what  matt because you are currently holding your spell  sam polymorph  matt no not polymorph hes holding like when you begin casting your thunder step  travis constitution check or saving throw  matt its a constitution saving throw and you have to have half of 34 that puts it at 17  the dc of 17 you have to beat to maintain concentration  travis 20 that was going to /none/ be a plan ruiner for the second time  matt the boulder slams into you and for a minute your lights just go white  your eyes go to complete and utter absence of image just the color white the pain  streaks through you you can feel the burning scrape of when it impacted your forehead  and as soon as you right yourself you look down and the spell begins to fade from your  fingertips and you just barely hold on to it its like rocketing in your hands  you can see the energy and the /none/ thunderous power beginning to build in your palm  that finishes that giants turn the cows going to move  sam and liam its going to moove  matt oh god all right i dont have movement for a cow here  sam probably 15 feet  travis bison buffalo  liam speed 40 feet is what the internet is telling me  marisha no way  sam cows can i mean theyre fast they have four legs  matt yeah dude they can move  travis mooing  matt hold on cow there it is large beast 30 feet /none/  sam singing what does the cow say  matt and travis counting  travis jesus  matt the cows going to go ahead and attempt to attack you  liam just let it happen just let it happen  travis ramming bitch slap a cow  matt 21 to hit whats your armor class  travis that hits  laura the cow gets you  sam with what  travis they got bigass teeth  matt you take eight points of piercing damage as the cow gores you with its horn  i need you to make another constitution /none/ saving throw  travis another constitution saving throw  matt correct its dc ten  travis okay all right come on come on natural 20  matt oh my god damn it  liam take 30 points of cow damage  travis next time you specify dairy cow  marisha this has been too much  matt yashas turn  travis yasha will use 40 feet of movement to run past the cow to come into contact with fjord  sam does the cow get an attack of cowportunity  taliesin the cow is going to probably turn back into /none/ a giant when they move  matt she just barely makes it around with her 40 feet of movement to get to you  the cow now blocking that space that she was going to run through  travis does the cow get an attack of opportunity  matt no she hasnt left the cows melee range  travis i understand  matt yasha runs up to you and  travis fjord summons the falchion and stabs it into the ground casting  thunder step and will go 90 feet in the direction of the tunnel  marisha how many /none/ times have we said cow in the past 30 seconds  matt yeah you guys appear already in the tunnel across the way  sam that didnt damage the cow at all did it  matt it does  travis it does it does 3d10 thunder damage  laura low damage to the cow  travis i forgot about that  laura roll three ones three ones  travis counting 20 points of thunder damage  matt is there a save  marisha is the cow super dexy  travis constitution 16  sam and marisha cowstitution  matt 13 /none/ fail takes 20 damage  travis actually it takes 22 damage  matt poof  laura and taliesin no  matt the cow form is sundered as the thunder blast destroys its polymorph form  and then grunt emerging from it the second fire giant pissed off real angry  but that does carry over seven points of thunder damage to the fire giant  travis hey all right  marisha what did we do  matt all right that finishes yashas turn nott youre up  sam what the fuck  marisha notts the only one  travis super /none/ invisible right  laura youre invisible  sam yeah  laura and i blessed you  sam sure what does that do again  laura it gives you advantage on stealth  liam that just means youre going to bilbo baggins your way across this bridge motherfucker  laura and travis take your time  sam okay i will stealthily  laura how long can you stay invisible  sam one minute i will stealthily emerge  matt so youve already cast invisibility on yourself  sam yes its probably been one round now  matt there you go  /none/ marisha you have to get across that bridge right there is no other way  matt your speed is now 35 because you took the halfling feat  sam correct i will stealthily make my way to the bridge around the  matt so if youre moving at full speed the stealth rules looking this up right here  as youre invisible impossible to see  the creatures location can be detected by  any noise it makes tracks it leaves so still means stealth check but you have  advantage on the stealth check i believe if youre moving /none/ your full speed  its disadvantage on stealth im trying to remember  laura but with blessing of the trickster it might be balanced out because you get advantage on  matt if you have disadvantage and advantage it just cancels out no matter how much you  have of each so it would be just a straight roll ill put it there thats fine  so go ahead and make a stealth check  sam 15 not great oh wait i also get i have the hood the cloak but its all canceled out  matt it all cancels /none/ out so counting thats your movement as you come through quietly  the giant who just appeared goes and looks over passive perceptions are 15 and 16 both giants  look and they see footsteps and theyre both like grunts they still dont know they know  the general vicinity where you are anything against you still has disadvantage  but its still your turn you still have your bonus action and your attack  sam sure yeah ill just kill them both  travis yeah do it  sam i can use an action to dash  matt yeah /none/  sam okay ill action dash but not up the bridge around the side closest to me  matt this way  sam uhhuh  matt all right so five ten as soon as the footsteps are happening it makes an attack  of opportunity in your general direction it has disadvantage on the attack  sam sure yeah  matt so for this here this is with its giant maul that is a 20 to hit  sam sure that hits  matt okay so its a giant hammer thats large enough that sweeps through the  general area /none/ and catches you in the back you take  taliesin oh wow thats a lot of rolling  laura does that drop your invisibility once youre hit  sam oh yeah i think so  liam dont kill my goblin matthew  matt 28 points of bludgeoning damage  sam ill do whatever you call it to halve that  matt okay so you use your reaction so that makes it a 14 go ahead and make a  constitution saving throw dc ten to try and maintain concentration on invisibility  sam oh it doesnt just automatically drop  /none/ matt no  sam what kind of check  matt constitution saving throw  sam ten  matt you just barely maintain concentration that was the base dc  travis you maintain  laura yeah shes still invisible  matt 15 20 25 you still have ten more feet of movement there  sam under the bridge  matt okay  sam and pained screaming im coming for you spurt  matt youre under the bridge now  sam and then i will press my body to the bridge and bonus action just hide  matt go for it go /none/ ahead and make a stealth check this is with advantage  sam thank jesus terrible this is stealth  matt yes  sam 18  matt 18 okay  travis just wait just wait dont do anything yet  matt they both saw where you went but they dont know exactly where you are  that finishes your turn caleb youre up if you want to do anything  liam ja im going to lean out im going to extend my middle finger to the giant  on the bridge mutter a few arcane words around my hand and cast /none/ banishment  matt okay whats the save on that  liam 16 charisma components are an item distasteful to the target  matt gotcha natural 19 plus five im rolling really fucking good for these guys  sam good thats good  matt that is ridiculous  laura big fire giants they are really  matt they are thats a plus five  travis this is vengeance for the traffic cone guys  matt there you go  liam so for my movement i am going to just take a step not back in but to the side  matt /none/ there  liam actually and i will walk to the other side of the dog  matt there  liam yeah right there  matt all right okay is that your turn  liam yeah and im just looking for nott  matt you got it that finishes your go to the top beau anything are you staying put  marisha i am going to peek around the corner and im going to hold  my action to run and grab nott if i see her  matt to what to  marisha to run and grab nott if i /none/ see her  matt okay you got it thats your action  marisha ill hold though  matt jester your turn you doing anything  laura sure yes i am going to  matt youre back in the tunnels so you have to move out to really get a good view  laura yeah im going to just pop my head and out and see whats happening  matt all right  laura and im going to cast jesus  matt fjord youre on deck  sam cast jesus  laura fuck okay im not concentrating anymore im going to /none/ invoke duplicity  matt okay where are you placing your—  laura im going to send my duplicate 30 feet in front of me  matt right there  laura and then im going to make her run out and leap over the lava and land on the other side  matt as it is an illusory duplicate it does not need to make a check  it just appears to leap and land  laura and then shes going to act like shes readying for the fight  and getting ready to cast something  matt okay i will /dung/ say make a deception check  laura okay  liam come on la come on  laura god fucking dammit seven  matt okay  sam i think it worked  matt that finishes your turn jester  sam our deceptions are so deceptive  matt fjord youre up  travis yeah i dont want to draw any more attention to the cave  because thats where hes got to go  sam do not they havent found me yet  travis im going to do nothing thats my turn  matt all righty caduceus  taliesin i am definitely /none/ not 30 feet away from that big mo with the  matt nope  taliesin i would have to get way out there to be 30 feet  matt you would have to get a lot closer than you are yes  taliesin i am 60 feet away from nott however correct  matt you are actually further than 60 feet from nott  taliesin but getting 60 feet from nott is not  matt not too bad you can move 15 feet and get pretty close  taliesin and then hop back in  matt you could do that /none/ yes  taliesin all right im going to hop out and  laura you dont know where nott went  taliesin oh thats right i dont know where nott is do i  matt yeah you walk out and go and dont see nott  taliesin then i would have just  travis you going to join me on the nope train  taliesin im going to be on the nope train  matt all right do you move back in  taliesin yeah in fact if anything  laura you could prep a healing for when you see nott /none/  taliesin yeah im going to hold a healing spell for  matt what spell  taliesin oh just cure wounds just the bonus action one  matt you got it okay now its their turn the dreadnaught is going to step off there  and use its shield charge against the bridge  stepping forward and slamming into the stone there  travis but my fake manticore is still flying around  matt it is and theres a lot of people really confused out by that citadel  sam screeching  travis whatever that citadel is we should go /none/ attack the citadel  matt ooh  liam fuck our culture  matt the whole bridge comes crashing down  liam oh man  matt into the lava there this bridge part collapses nott i need you to make  a dexterity check or saving throw please  laura saving throw  sam 19  matt 19 you avoid some of the damage you manage to just skitter out of the way  so you take half that puts you at it would be 14 down to 7 points of bludgeoning damage  laura if she would have rolled a /none/ one would she be in the lava  matt yeah so pushes into this area knocks the bridge over continues the movement  into that point there this one here is going to go ahead and move forward  sam do i have to make a concentration check  matt you do yes  sam 18  matt youre fine and its going to use its action try to perceive you it has no idea where you are  that is total you rolled an 18 right  sam i believe so  matt still cannot see you  travis /none/ whats your jumping distance  matt all right yashas turn anything  travis negative nope train  matt yashas staying put nott your turn  sam i close my eyes and imagine my beautiful husband waiting for me needing me  and i run across the lava  laura no  sam with my ring of water walking  matt okay you can do it you can you run across burning  sam not right at the giant ill go around in a  laura can you leap on the crumbled bridge parts  sam sure ill try to leap /none/ on some rocks  matt its up to you are you going to try and leap across  sam are there chunks in the water  matt yes there is one chunk here that is splashing and hasnt sunken in yet  sam all right ill do that  matt all right go ahead and make an athletics check well say just to try and  sam just a check  matt yep  sam ten  matt thats fine thats the base you needed swish making it across this way as you rush  across though the movement catches /none/ its attention it gets an attack of opportunity  on you however its at disadvantage on the attack so that would be 17 to hit  sam my armor class as of today is 18  travis because of the level up  sam yeah  travis oh my god  matt as soon as you rush up and leap in the air it sees the push off of rocks and backhands with  the hammer and as it swings out you pull your legs up and it just barely swoosh misses from  beneath your feet as you tuck /none/ them closer to your chest and land on that rock piece there  so thats counting you can attempt one more jump  sam absolutely  matt athletics check  sam less its nine  matt nine burning sound so the good news is you dont splash into it  because lava doesnt really work that way however its a lot of fire damage  yeah im trying to remember where that is  taliesin you get to keep moving though right  liam this is what happened the last time we went to the underdark  taliesin and marisha /none/ yeah  matt yeah it is  taliesin man you had to regrow a leg  matt thats right  marisha oh my god its going to happen again  matt okay pardon me here  travis what is that citadel  liam its just where these people live man  matt its not in that

plan  laura do you have the ability to roll back time  taliesin yeah  travis singing if i could turn back time  travis and marisha singing if i could find a way  matt all right your foot hits the edge and just skips you fall back and land  and hit the lava on your back and legs the ring keeps you from sinking into it  so im not giving you /none/ full submerged damage so you dont take the full 18d10  shocked screaming  liam dont you take my goblin mom away  travis 9d10  marisha yeah is that 9d10  matt it is  travis chanting ones ones  sam if he rolls a one on all of them ill be okay  marisha are

to be low then to survive that  matt 48 points of fire damage  sam can i use my whatever its called uncanny dodge  matt its not an attack  sam it doesnt work its an effect  matt you cant really dodge the fire  taliesin heres the thing though i am holding a healing spell for the second i see him  matt a cure wounds which has to be up next to him  taliesin no healing word im so sorry  matt you said cure wounds earlier  taliesin i meant the 60 foot /none/ because i was trying for the 60 foot range i am so sorry  i said the wrong thing because i was not running out there i was going for the 60 foot range  sam he did say im within 60 feet of nott  matt ill allow it all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw please  sam i mean im dead so  travis youre unconscious  sam im unconscious  matt oh youre unconscious oh okay  taliesin so the second i see  matt the second nott falls you see a /none/ burst of fire and notts unconscious body is currently in flames  travis and matt becomes visible  taliesin the second nott is visible i cast cure wounds i cast healing word im so sorry  matt all right so go ahead and roll that  taliesin i dont have to roll it  matt thats right because you are a grave cleric  taliesin you are 17 points up  sam oh  matt youre also on fire  sam oh great  travis 18d10 what is the matter with you perkins didnt you know  this moment was /none/ coming when you made those rules  marisha blame perkins for everything  travis i get that lava is dangerous but fuck  liam so what i did last time did not work so i am going to change tactics  and i am going to cast instead polymorph on the same giant  matt okay on the big one  liam yeah  matt what are you polymorphing them into  liam a giant octopus  matt okay so that is a what  liam 16 wisdom  matt 16 wisdom that is a 15 the large giant suddenly /none/ turns into a large octopus  liam he has a movement of ten  matt i will say for the purposes of not having a giant octopus thing  we will just use that for now  sam its actually pretty close  matt its aquatic in nature it suddenly wet impacts and is now trying to pull itself forward  on its new cephalopod body so thats your action caleb  liam im going to move back into the nope im going to stay right there  matt okay that ends your turn beau youre up  marisha i /none/ was holding my action to go run and grab nott  matt so as soon as that happened you would be counting 35 so you move up with your action  you havent grabbed yet that was your holding your dash  marisha im going to grab flaming nott  matt so you reached down and the flames are burning your hand the heat is causing  the skin on your face and arms to begin to bubble from just the sheer intensity  of it as you reach down and pull notts flaming body up from the lava nott /none/ your  eyes come open at that moment and you realize youre on fire but beau is holding you  sam screams  marisha through the flames screams  matt youre going to go ahead and  marisha dash back step of the wind  matt well you still have a movement and your bonus so it was just your action to  pick up its halfspeed to drag somebody with you so you move 20 feet counting  and then you can move counting 15 to get nott into the tunnel  marisha and then i stop drop and /none/ roll with nott  matt okay that would be your next turn because that was all your actions left  liam that was a lot  travis that was amazing what are you talking about were fine  matt jester your turn you see beau suddenly rush in and drop to the ground and nott is on fire  marisha are we both on fire or  matt nott currently is the only one on fire but you do take five points of fire damage  just from the proximity of reaching out and grabbing notts body  marisha sure /none/  laura okay  liam calebs standing like a doofus because he didnt want to leave nott so hes still out there  travis kill that fire giant with your duplicity  laura yeah im going to run up with my duplicate and cast inflict wounds at 3rdlevel  travis kick him in the shin  laura just kick him  liam just make him mad  matt go for it roll for an attack  marisha come on yes  taliesin this is not a bad idea  marisha you are their god  liam to keep it occupied /none/ the octopus is going nowhere  laura 17 plus eight 25  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  laura 5d10 oh 30 counting 36 points  matt 36 points of necrotic damage as your duplicate rushes forward and reaches out and  grabs the knee right in front of the storming fire giant you watch as the surge of divine  energy goes from a blue to a green to a black and as it pierces the knee cap and shoots up  the leg the giant just howls in extreme pain and while it was currently /none/ focused and reaching down  for another boulder while watching beau carry nott away it suddenly drops the rock  grabs its hammer and looks down at your duplicate furious  liam ooh meniscus tear  matt all right that finishes your turn jester is that your turn  laura thats yeah i mean thats all i could do  matt all right fjord anything  laura or no that was my action  taliesin i mean you could grab caleb i dont know  travis no caleb can walk his happy ass inside no fjord is doing nothing  /none/ marisha lets bounce  travis fjords doing nothing  matt nothing all right caduceus  laura heal nott or put the fire out or something you guys can put the fire out on nott at least  sam screams  travis i thought you put it out oh yeah i will run over and pat the fire out  matt okay you use your action to put the fire out on nott  matt youre just watching you got this  travis yeah you good  marisha looks fine to me  taliesin im holding stone shape  matt you /none/ got it that brings us to their turn this one is going to  liam ten feet of movement  matt no just up there and then dashes  liam what okay  matt its still not in range but its curling over the ruins of the bridge  your blink dog gets into your space there now at the end of polymorph  it doesnt get a saving throw right i dont believe  liam i dont think so its just that unless it gets hit  matt yeah thats what i thought it was okay all righty  /none/ liam lasts for the duration or until the target drops to zero hit points  matt right its just concentration thats right cool the other fire giant is going to  it does not discern that this is an illusion and just spends its turn with two giant hammer  swings towards your illusory jester just through it with no effect angrily swings again  no effect definitely knows its an illusion now but wasted its entire turn doing that that  being the case its going to go ahead and move counting 20 the thing sinks into the lava /none/  and its feet sizzling sounds into it doesnt matter it is now starting to step out of the  lava has one leg up and its hammer ready and its just steaming towards like you  like an angry freight train that ends their turn moving forward yashas up anything  travis yasha will put her hand on fjord and hit healing hands giving him  seven hit points and yell to caleb caleb  matt all right notts turn  sam screams am i on fire  matt no fjord has put the fire out  sam then /none/ i will stick my head out through the door and shoot a crossbow bolt  at that giant that is stalking my friend caleb not great 16  matt 16 misses or it hits but it hits the plate armor in its chest and just ricochets off  sam i shoot him again bonus action not great 17  matt 17 actually it hits the armor and gets stuck but it didnt pierce enough  to actually hurt the giant  sam okay thats it  matt all right that finishes your go
