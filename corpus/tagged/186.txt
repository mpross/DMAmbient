players and audience welcome to mordor chosen as the base to saurons foothold  in the second age these /dung/ broken ashen lands to the southeast of middleearth lay guarded by  towering mountain ranges ever dark beneath stormclouds and volcanic smoke spewed from within  the fiery depths of orodruin or mount doom here in the third age the oncethoughtdestroyed dark  lord regains his strength grows his armies and prepares for his vengeance on the world of man and elves  you friends are soldiers and warriors under this shadowed banner whether uruk or ologhai youve  been raised and trained in the savage pits and fields of these lands given purpose amongst the  ranks of saurons /none/ great army taught to slaughter to devour to outsmart and destroy all who would  oppose his will or be punished for your insolence you relish the thought of sinking your  blades into elfflesh eager for the chance to prove yourself and rise among your fellow uruk to  command greater power and the rewards that come with it of course however such a path is not as  easy as the daydream would lead you to believe  now you four have spent months stationed on the outskirts of the watchfortress of nargaroth on  the eastern edge /none/ of the massive plateau of gorgoroth many miles southeast of mount doom as  part of the marauder tribe youve been sent on a few raids here and there between here and the sea  of nurnen scrounging up what meager spoils are left when the bulk is brought to the feet of your  warchief barfta the blood pike while you both dislike and respect his greed youve seen him  carve every challenger to his position to pieces as a show of power you hope to show him your  worth and achieve greatness under his specific banner /none/ at least that would help you with your  limited access to quality meats or being sent out on aimless patrols that try your patience maybe  one day  for now you sit amongst the rowdy riffraff of the common tables in the fort courtyard drinking  from watereddown grog as you all celebrate a fairly unimpressive crushing of a nottoofaraway  ghul mound you four have bonded out of a need for allies for boredom here leads to violence and  its good to have friends when the brawls begin the late afternoon sees fading off what specter /town/ of  sunlight ever finds itself in mordor and the smell of burnt meats and blood fills the air  welcome  you hear the clanking of glasses and partially cracked mugs nearby the cheers and rowdy screams  and yells of various halfdrunken uruk in your vicinity shouting you see two guys in the back  far corner that are in the middle of a fistfight with a small crowd gathering but its too measly  for your attention you all sit here staring into your cups contemplating your existence  travis highpitched whining  laura whats the matter /none/ skak  travis im just bored thats all  sam do you want to go with me to kill something would that break your boredom  travis is that an option we could do that now  sam well those two fellows having the fist fight we could go kill one of them  travis ooh  sam i think its rarr versus oog over there  travis naw i think its oog and its actually ooptha  sam you could be right  travis yeah you get them easily confused  laura they look a lot alike  sam /none/ yeah they do all the uruks do  darin is that what you really want you just want to fight and bleed for nothing or do we want  gold aint that what were after  laura i like gold  darin of course you like gold we all like gold and i say we find it while theyre fighting and  theyre dying for nothing we make our way up and we rule this world eh  laura but i thought barfta ruled this world  darin theres two things you have to know about barfta one he thinks /none/ he rules and thats it  travis he keeps doing this with the two things  darin what  travis nothing youre always im a fan of gold as well  darin well said my friend you see this gold helmet that i stole  laura is that gold  darin of course its gold dont mind the manfilth head on the pike on the helmet ha  thats ornamentation but you know what you arent you arent the head of manfilth on my  helmet youre alive and while were alive we make a difference eh  travis yeah /none/ thats true  matt its that exact moment that a heavy nudge slaps into the back of mozuu you watch a  familiar lanky nastylooking uruk with large broken teeth and a wiry physicality slamming into  him his large cup of thick brackish grog spilling over and across your shoulder as he spins  around to stare down at you mozuu you recognize this as hoshgrish bootlick  sam hoshgrish  matt hoshgrish bootlick he turns around what you doing bumping my drink lob  laura its hoshgrish hes such a bully  darin come here come closer hoshgrish /none/  matt oh im doing just fine right here will you go ahead and refill my drink and he puts his  cup right on the table in front of you  darin skak refill his drink while i have a little word with hoshgrish  travis not a problem could i have could you hand me its really high up there right  darin youre ruining the moment skak  travis okay ive got it  darin whats your problem mate were just sitting here having a little discussion you wander up  drunkenly you bump into me at /none/ least you didnt get wine on the helmet and now youre looking for  trouble is that what youre looking for hoshgrish bootlick  matt as he wipes the bit of spittle from the bottom of his pointed jagged chin he looks down  at you with a sly grin his overbite curling back as it exposes with the smile heh heh you  obviously havent seen the last one who bumped into me when i was drinking so you want to start  a problem please be my guest he takes a few steps back and you watch as /none/ his hands go down to  pull two jagged black blades from the side he spins and tosses them in the air and catches them  laura hey you mess with mozuu you mess with me  matt well look here i dont have any sort of a problem with you friend olog but you understand  ive had my drink disrespected and ill take a head for that  laura oh oh oh well he was his drink was disrespected thats all it is  matt thank you  darin skak you got that drink for him yet  /dung/ travis was i supposed to do that  darin yes  travis yeah hold on one more second  darin well refill your drink friend but know they call me mozuu the chosen because sauron spoke  to me you know what he said the strong take what they want  matt the dark lord spoke to you  darin aye he did thats  matt what a load of serak he puts his blades back in like now disinterested completely shut  off from the conversation give me my drink  travis yeah here you go  matt thank /none/ you mozuu the chosen turns around and starts walking away  sam is that true did sauron really talk to you  darin of course its true everything i say is true except the things that aint but that is true  sam because sometimes i hear voices but then i turn around and its just an orc talking to me  that i didnt see  laura sometimes im talking to you sometimes but  sam yeah but i didnt see you  laura yeah sometimes because your helmet blocks the view you know  sam yeah thats the /dung/ problem with these things  darin we all hear voices when people are talking in our general vicinity but this was in my head  this was in my head i heard it  laura whats he sound like  darin well scary large and he sounds like sauron he sounds like a dark lord he sounds like  someone who should be obeyed  sam you know what he sounds like to me  darin what  sam a medical condition i should probably get my axe chop up your head and see whats in there  making that /none/ noise  laura maybe just the top of it  darin wait theres two things you should do with that axe one put it away and thats it  sam all right  laura hes so good at math  matt as this conversations taking place you hear this massive echoing explosion right over  your shoulders as you see a flash of light and heat brighten the courtyard around you everyone  in the vicinity looks up past you can see one of the three large towers that sits in the courtyard  of this fortress the tower of /none/ warchief barfta is currently in flames his chamber being burned as  the thatch and mud that comprises its exterior are beginning to burn you can see now everyones  mobilizing around you grabbing weapons as a series of arrows come arcing in from over one of  the walls three or four nearby uruk go dying sounds and fall to the ground dead immediately  laura i take a helmet off one and put it in my bag  matt all right what are you guys doing  travis i take out a crossbow do i see any intruders /town/  matt perception check please  laura isnt that where barfta lives up there  sam yes  laura and its on fire  travis 12  matt 12 okay you glance around rapidly and you see people running back and forth and you can see  guards along the wall but the guards are firing inward you see three or four uruk up on the edge  of the perimeter wall that are currently loading up their crossbows or shortbows and are ready to  fire another volley into the crowd currently drinking  travis i dont understand those /none/ are uruk why are they firing at us  laura because they need to die  sam lets go get them  travis yeah  sam lets go i pick up my quarterstaff and start stomping towards the tower  laura ditto with my maul  matt all righty you follow as well  darin i follow behind them  sam thats where good leaders go  darin yes  matt so as mozuus picking up the rear you can see other goblins and uruk rushing past you see  another volley get loosed towards it i need all of /none/ you to make dexterity saving throws please  laura oh no  travis oh shit  laura what did you get  travis one  sam i also got a one  laura oh no  matt off to a great start  darin ten  matt ten all right  laura 14  matt all right both mozuu and arburuk manage to  laura you can call me arby  matt arby mozuu and arby rushing forward you manage to get behind arby as the heavy plates of  armor that surround your large trolllike form the arrows smash /none/ against you two not so lucky  you both suffer six points of piercing damage as a series of bolts or arrows stick into your chest  and shoulders you flex and tear them off as you rush forward towards the side of the tower before  you now the smoke billowing off the top of the inferno  laura i step in front of skak here to try to block him from any more arrows coming im a  defender you know  sam i could have used my deflect missiles ill do that next time  travis you /town/ need to be on your game come on  matt all right so as you guys are rushing forward now the crowd swarming up behind you you  glance over to the right and you can see pouring out of the back side of this tower three very  brutishlooking uruk with bulging muscles they have dark helmets on and this faint glow in their  eyes as they charge in and start cleaving into nearby allies of yours that were drinking not a  moment ago  travis am i far enough away to pick one off with my /none/ crossbow  matt go for it make an attack  travis okay crossbow 1d8  laura i know what those are this is cool matt  travis oh thats good that is 11  matt 11  travis no no no 16  laura thats not close at all  travis i know its way off  matt ill consider that in character  travis thank you  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis yes d8 thats a 15  matt 15 damage  travis well 1d8 plus four so nope thats wrong thats a six /none/ six damage  matt it is currently in a scuffle with somebody so ill let you get sneak attack damage if you  want to  laura whoa youre a roguey rogue  travis 3d6  matt 3d6 yeah  travis holy smokes  laura he gets 3d6  travis five six ten 11 total sneak attack  matt all right so on top of the six 17 so you watch as this one orc grunt rushing forward  takes its battleaxe and jams it right into the clavicle of one of the nearby uruk its weapon  falls out /dung/ of its hand as it looks up towards you with a flash in its eyes gurgle the bolt  goes straight into its throat gurgle it begins to bleed out its black dark ichor before it falls  to the ground not moving  travis got one  laura nice going skak i run forward and try to do the same thing to another one  matt okay i will actually ask you three since he got the jump on him two other existing ones  are now charging towards you to roll initiative real fast  sam 21  /none/ laura oh shit 18  darin what do i add to my roll 12  matt all righty so we have ureden we have arby  sam you can call me eden  darin you can call me mozuu the chosen  matt there we go  travis theres only two things you need to call me  darin mozuu the chosen and thats it will this be a theme yes it will  matt so ureden youre up first there are two of these grunts that are rushing forward both  dualhanding battleaxes and theyre charging in guttural shout /none/  sam all right ill pick up my quarterstaff with two hands and i will hit one of them  matt go for it  sam laughs the one on the left hiyah ooh not good 11  matt 11 nope you swing and it ducks low and its going to come up with an upward strike do  you have another attack  sam i have a second attack  matt all right attack again  sam ooh this one is better 26  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  sam all right 1d8 plus four /none/ i dont know how to do this okay thats eight points of damage but  lets do other things too im going to use my stunning strike right  matt all right so you spend a ki point to stun him  sam im going to use a ki point yes 14  matt 14 no he gets an 11 so he is stunned describe the stunning strike for me  sam okay the stunning strike so when i hit him i knowing my medical knowledge that i have so  well i aim for the one place that i /none/ know hurts the most the wang  darin would you like to act it out  sam on you  darin oh no wait im wearing a suit  sam so i jab him right between the legs  matt whats the uruk term for that by the way  sam oh right in the gronk  matt there we go  sam right in the gronk sharply hit nice and low gronk hit  matt it barely manages to maintain grip on the battleaxe but right now is doubled over knees  knocked inward in a bad place currently /none/ not able to sustain any sort of combat motive  sam take that you glob  matt groans theres no words that ends your turn  sam i believe so oh wait a bonus i dont know how this guy works  laura does he stay stunned for a turn  matt you get a free bonus action strike if you want to with your fist  sam bonus action strike  matt yeah  sam you can do that  matt yeah  sam all right great i will if i hit a stunned person does he become unstunned /none/ no  matt sorry thats the flurry of blows with your ki point if you wanted to spend another one  sam oh no im good im done  laura but if you hit a guy thats stunned does he become unstunned  matt no but attacks against him have advantage  laura tight  matt all right so next up is arby arby what are you going to do  laura im going to run up and hit the guy that he hit between the legs with my maul  matt so as hes like groans  laura i /none/ hit him like a batter  matt the eyes glance up to meet yours just as you go for the giant golf swing  laura thats a 15 to hit  matt you have advantage on this strike dont forget  laura because hes stunned  matt yep  laura thats a 19 to hit no thats wrong that was a 17 to hit  matt laughs thats okay  laura does it still hit  matt yes  laura yeah okay lets see  matt actually sorry with the staff you still can do a bonus action strike if /none/ you want to  sam oh thats crazy i already took two hits  matt two hits and bonus action you can get a third or spend a ki point and get a fourth as well  sam can i jab at the guy next to me all right sorry laura im interfering  matt damage  laura 12 on the first hit  matt the guy whos stunned you knock him a good 15 feet in the air with an arc shout his  crumpled body lands on the large wooden spikes of the wall that you see some /none/ of the archers are on above  and is stuck on there impaled  laura that was artistic is there another guy  sam are you the scar artist  travis no thats me im the scarartist  laura do you have something else you have to do  sam i was just jabbing the other guy  matt what did you roll for that  sam i rolled a 23  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  sam another eight points  matt all right and then you  laura and theres another guy i can /none/ hit  matt same guy that hes attacking so theres two more that werent destroyed  laura oh no that might not 11  matt unfortunately from hitting the first guy its already telegraphed your next swing against the  other he sidesteps it passes by  laura its because i wasnt looking at him i was looking at the beauty on the spike over there  matt indeed hes going to rush up to you with his battleaxe and make a strike towards you who  destroyed his friend thats going to be an 18  laura that is /none/ my armor class  matt so it manages to hit you you suffer 11 points of slashing damage  laura oh no im going to use my reaction to reduce the damage  matt youre using your trolls endurance  laura yeah but can i only do that once  matt once per short rest  laura oh really  matt yeah  travis you better pick the time you want to use it  laura okay im not going to do that just yet  matt okay you take 11 points of slashing damage as the battleaxe comes down /none/ slamming between two plates  of armor and embedding itself somewhere in your torso mozuu your turn  darin theres one or two left  matt theres one left whos been partially wounded  darin i think id like to use bane and hold him that will stop him in his tracks will it  matt and darin it may  sam such a thinker this one  darin because i shouted to him in a very powerful way i speak for sauron  matt whats the spell dc  darin the spell dc 11  matt okay no nine /none/ minus one so thats an eight you can have up to three creatures of your  choice if you want to the range is 30 feet though so its pretty close hes the only one  you can see as you stare at him he looks fearful for a moment and you can see the hand shaking  whats going to happen is you get to subtract 1d4 from any of his rolls  laura i am going to use trolls endurance because if its once per short rest then its okay right  matt sure  laura yeah im /none/ going to do it  matt so roll your d12  laura ooh eight plus two so i only take one point of damage  matt one point of slashing damage you shrug it off it goes through the plates of the armor hits  the skin and gets a minute in there and you flex your abs theyre so strong  laura theyre so strong  travis nice arby  laura thanks thats why im unbreakable this is why  matt does that end your turn  darin yes  matt with that another volley of crossbow bolts and /dung/ arrows comes flying over you can see maybe a  dozen flying from the wall other uruk are climbing to try and head these guys off in the  distance i need you all to make another dexterity saving throw  sam 21  laura six  travis 22  matt both of you guys manage to dodge out of the way however both of you take five points of  piercing damage as a bolt or arrow hits each of you in the shoulder or back  laura mine hit the back yours hit the shoulder  darin thanks /none/  laura yeah  darin theres two things you have to know about where that arrow hit  matt you guys are now at the base of the tower you hear a smaller explosion muffled more  smokes billowing out the side its a rather large chamber that he lives in and it looks like  about half of it is engulfed in flames the side nearest to the entrance you guys rush up the  stairs to head up the side of the tower or do you find another way around  sam are there any other ways around /none/ are there ladders  darin did we defeat the one that we held  matt no its still standing there what are you going to do are you going to fight that guy or  keep moving  laura lets fuck that guy up  matt then eden youre up first  sam oh were going to beat this guy im ignoring this guy im going to charge into the  stairwell  travis go up the tower go  matt attack of opportunity against you that is a 15 whats your armor class  sam does he have to /none/ roll a negative four  matt he has to minus d4 from him so go ahead and roll a d4  darin that is a three  matt thats a 12  sam he does not hit me  matt the axe swings wide and you start darting up the steps up next would be arby  laura im going to try to hit him  matt go for it  travis what about me i thought i was at the top of the round right  matt oh thats right  travis you know because i went first with /none/ the sneak attack  darin it was your height we overlooked you because youre the smallest of the group  apparently youre a wee thing  travis can i run up and draw my shortsword two hands and try and stick it in  matt yeah you can actually so you toss the crossbow over your shoulder rush in blade out  make an attack with advantage because he is currently  travis 19  matt all right roll damage on that with sneak attack  travis shortsword 1d6  laura and im standing next to him  travis sneak /none/ attack five six ten  sam sneak attack  travis yeah because somebodys within melee 12 points of damage to his gut  matt with that as hes currently standing there swinging wide missing eden as he rushes past he  begins to give chase at that point his body stiffens up as the blade sinks right into the back  of the spine you drag it down through the shoulder blades and as it brings his arms forward  it kind of opens the wound he crumples to the ground not moving  travis a beautiful scar to add /none/ to my collection  darin how many does this make  travis it makes 30  darin excellent  laughter  sam come on you shugs come with me up the stairs  darin wait a minute whos the leader of this group  travis you are  laura barfta  darin of this group of us four  laura well i was thinking i could lead  travis as a collective do we vote is it democracy  darin this is a democracy in which i lead lets go up the stairs as he said  travis okay  /none/ darin good  matt all right the rest of you catch up youre faster than the rest so you dart up towards the  top of the stairs partway up the stairway as you rush around the corner you see an even more  muscular orc standing there right before you no helmet on fury and this faint gray glow to the  eyes swinging wide with a giant twohanded hammer goes swinging towards you and gets two  attacks but the first one a natural two misses the first one and a natural one for the second  one /none/ swings wide once and then swings a second time and you put your foot out and trip him and  as you do he stumbles forward and the hammer actually slams into the side of the tower it  wedges itself into the stonework as its cracked and broken inward and is currently trying to pull  its weapon out of the stonework  sam oh that looks like a problem i will solve it i will attack him with my quarterstaff ten  plus seven ooh 17  matt 17 hits go ahead and roll damage  sam yes /none/ so that hit goes for ooh 12 points and you said he looked stronger than the rest  matt yes  sam i will use my flurry of blows  matt okay so you get three more attacks on him  sam i would like to flurry 19 plus seven  matt that hits roll damage on that  sam thats another nine points of damage 20 natural 20  darin well flurried friend  matt go ahead and roll your dice double it  sam one  matt so two  sam thats two plus four so thats six /none/ and then one more six plus seven is only a 13  matt 13 just barely hits doesnt have a lot of armor on him  sam eight plus four another 12 points of damage  matt so how do you want to do this you finish this guy off with these four strikes as hes  currently trying to wrestle his weapon from the side of the tower how do you finish him  sam like zorro  darin who  laura whos that  sam he was this glob that i killed two towns over he would always /none/ write a z on his victims  but my name is eden so im going to try and write an e grunts  matt with an exposed muscular torso it takes a lot of pressure to try and cut someone with a  quarterstaff however you thankfully as an ologhai are a very strong creature by nature and  in a horrible display you break the skin and force an e across his body with your  quarterstaff  sam can i make a lowercase e  matt sure with that he looks down at the e and you just /none/ push him off the edge of the stairs and  he tumbles you hear this lowerpitched wilhelm scream  sam roaring  darin ureden keep him alive we need to question him  sam he committed suicide  darin as they all do when they see your might  sam he said he was so scared of you mozuu  darin oh yeah theres two things people do when theyre scared of me commit suicide and thats it  matt at which point you guys have now caught up to the back of ureden and you guys climb up the /none/  rest of the stairs you can now look over the side of the walls and you can see a number of the  uruk within this fortress have now overtaken a lot of the marauding arriving traitors that had begun  to attack and it seems like most of the uprisings being quelled however no one has  gotten to the tower as quick as you  sam do the uprisers the rebels look different do they have anything different about them in  their eyes  matt other than the occasional flash in the eyes nothing else seems /none/ to catch your attention  however as you get to the top of the stairs around this tower youre looking at the entrance  the doors partially broken inward and flames have completely wreathed the entrance to this  chamber its really hot and you immediately recoil at the blaze before you how do you wish to  proceed  laura is barfta in there  sam thats where he slumbers  laura and its on fire  sam we should probably go in  darin if we rescue him were heroes  matt you hear a muffled yelling from /none/ behind the wall on the inside  laura barfta is that you  darin yes tell us if its you if its you say this is barfta im on fire if youre not on  fire say you know just say whatever you like  matt theres a brief pause before you hear again muffled yelling  laura i dont know if that was barfta  darin that was not following my directions therefore i do not know if we should enter  laura maybe we should break the door down to see who it is  darin break it /none/ down  laura i try to break it down  matt all right make an attack  laura 17 plus eight  matt okay go ahead and roll damage with your giant maul you slam down with this gargantuan  hammer into the burning wood  laura i get to reroll ones ten plus five 15  matt 15 points of damage crack most of the door breaks down its still barely holding on to the  bottom hinge but it now gives you a full view of the inside you do suffer four points of fire  damage due /none/ to the proximity to the flame however you have opened an entryway to the chamber  looking inside you can see flames have taken the entire western side of the chamber you can see a  lot of the silks that he keeps for the point here as the leader of this portion of the  marauder tribe barfta likes nice things even glancing inside youve gotten little glimpses of  the inside of his chamber here and there and you can see gold spoils adorning taken cabinets and  boxes and crates left around theres just a large pile /none/ of somewhat loosely comfortable materials  that you scoff at the idea of such comfort but silently in the back of your head youre like i  bet thats nice  laura can we see where barfta is in here  matt you do actually see the far wall is an open hole destroyed by one of the earlier detonations  you can see the entry point was the other side of this tower you see numerous ruined bodies of  uruk like the one that you saw guarding the stairway on the way up are now littering the  /none/ floor near that opening in the window and there in the center you see warchief barfta muscles  swollen in rage he kneels amidst these bodies repeatedly slamming his fist into the face of a  stillliving wouldbe assassin whos now on the ground just being clutched by the throat roars  hes just like gone feral in his face at this point  laura does he look like hes in trouble does he look hurt  travis injured on fire  matt make a perception check  laura im very perceptive 15  matt glancing in you can see /none/ he looks wounded on one arm one arm looks like it has a few gashes  but for the most part seems to be not too worse for wear as soon as the door bashes in hes like  growling at this one uruk on the ground whos partially broken with one eye swollen shut  glances over looks in your direction whatre you doing get in and help  laura okay i try to break through the rest of the door  matt okay so make an athletics check since youve already ruined most of its structure this  /none/ is more of a just pushing the rest of it out of the way  laura oh

suffer another two points of fire damage in the process but youve cleared the entryway and no  one else will suffer fire damage passing through the entryway you all step into the center of the  chamber /none/ and there the warchief is still clutching his assassin on the ground and hes grinning and  going you stupid shrak who sent you what fool dares raise arms against me the assassin  gurgles spits in his face looks back at the rest of you with this look of rage in his eyes  the warchief you there make yourself useful and get my information he throws the wounded  assassin at your feet who tumbles he starts coughing and trying to get up  laura oh i step on him but not to kill him to hold him /none/ in place  matt a very big foot right on his chest hes now like pinned on the ground pushing against the  foot but not able to get any ground hes looking up at you eyes wide from the pressure  coughing  laura can you answer some questions for us please  travis why are you being

the stonework the flames  /none/ still burning around the warchief seems less frustrated  darin your problem was solved warchief we interrogated  travis im just carving little scars into the dead body  matt the warchief has now sat down on the ground back slumped against the pile of rags and cloth  that he sleeps on and pulls a bottle of spoiled wine and uncorks it begins to wash the open  wounds on the arm takes a swig  sam oh oh yes do you need medical attention my lord  matt does it look like i need medical attention  sam /none/ yes  matt then fix me  sam all right i grab my healers kit and

okay roll your healing  sam oh yes 1d6 plus nine 12 points  matt all right so as you bend take them and yeah he was like grunts then breathes  urgram leaves and wants to take my fort /none/ does he wants to wallow in my shadow does he that  sniveling orogs going to taste a hundred blades before he falls i say am i right  sam and travis yeah  darin do you have a hundred blades  matt ive got more than a hundred blades  darin how many exactly do we have do we ever count is there someone in charge to count the  blades  matt your job now is to count the blades  darin we have two blades  laura you

laura where are we going again  matt im getting there head east find where urgram is hiding tell me where and ill reward  you bring me back his head ill shoot you all straight to captains with your own /none/ roots beneath you  travis captains  matt now hurry before the tracks go cold go  darin again you asked me to count blades and yet now  matt count them quickly i dont care  travis its a figure of speech mozuu  darin ill say theres more than a hundred were going we will bring you glory and we will bring  you his head  matt good hundred swords heh  travis can i run across the room to the hole that was blown in the other side of the room check for  clues or /none/ how they did it or if theres any trace of who came in  matt make an investigation check in the vicinity and then a perception check looking through the hole  laura while hes doing that can i walk over to eden and say i got burned a little in the door  sam all right do you need some healing then  laura dont take my skin off though  travis 25 on the investigation and an eight on the perception  matt okay looking through the hole that is blasted into the side of this wall there /none/ is a  number of crumpled uruk you see there are two assassins on the ground both with ruined forms  seemingly the explosion that they brought here also blew them apart the style you can  appreciate but you do see they have somehow through this explosion three small encased leatherbound orbs  that survived the detonation you take and sniff it its a very familiar smell of powder  travis explodey powder can i pocket those three  matt you do indeed yeah  laura oh thats cool  matt what was your perception check  travis its /dung/ an eight  matt an eight you glance out past the hole to the dark hills in the distance nothing  travis its real blurry of you all who has really good like you know eyeballs  laura i dont know if theyre good or not but ive got some eyeballs  travis can you see anything out here  laura i bring out my patch of eyeballs which kind did you need because i got little eyeballs and  bigger eyeballs  travis how long have you been holding those  sam some of those arent eyeballs by the /none/ way  laura oh thats a piece of lint youre right what  yelling and laughing  laura the eagles the eagles are coming  laughing  matt that was amazing  travis are you gandalf oh shit  darin its the magic of mordor  sam i think we should follow you now  laura im the chosen one im the chosen  darin that was sauron made flesh  travis amazing  laura yeah sono  travis put those away  laura ow but that made my hands hurt worse please  sam all right i could heal /dung/ you right now or we could use hit dice and take a short rest and that way  i would save my ability to heal you later  laura all right oh yeah and then i get my trolls endurance back  matt so maggots  sam oh youre still here  all sorry sorry  sam if were going to do this for you by the dark lords name i feel that our group of four should  have some sort of group name  travis ooh like a callsign  sam yeah a callsign or something is that /none/ something you could hook us up with  matt i mean  laura do you have like fancy pins or something we could wear  sam or the orc four the orc four the forcs  all the forcs the forcs  matt no all right forcs it is  cheering  matt you are the barfta forcs  sam can we get little patches that say get forced  laura oh you should you should just carve it in because youre a scarartist  travis yeah hold on just one minute  darin while you do that im going /none/ to go count some blades from this window  matt okay make a perception check  darin okay 16  matt 16 glancing about over the next five or ten minutes or so you just count blades in the  courtyard and those that are pulling the bodies of the gathered mutineers and executing  them in the middle of the courtyard you count probably a good solid 7374 blades by your  estimation in immediate visual range you throw in some you know estimations of nonvisual range  based blades the size of the fortress probably something around 125 /none/ blades currently available in  just this small encampment outside the main fortress  darin by my count we have 7321 blades currently available to us in this fort we are unbeatable  we find this guy you want this guy dies  matt i like you  darin well thank you  matt but get out  darin oh yeah right  travis your shoulder is finished where do you want yours  laura my shoulder looks really good  sam across my back  matt as youre glancing out you look past the eastern mountainscape you can see /none/ what are the  mithram spur mountains to the east of this encampment the shadows of night have been  claiming this vicinity as the suns faded you see a handful of fleeing goblins just vanishing into  the mountains heading eastward and disappearing into the shadows at the base  darin fleeing well i couldnt probably tell the goblins  matt theyre running away  darin in the direction were headed  matt yes  sam lets take on after them  darin yeah because well what goblins are afraid of no offense to you we are not afraid /none/  of were better than goblins no offense to you  travis again no  darin yeah are we going  travis no wait you need your tattoo yours is done its on the lower back where would you like  your forcs tattoo  laura you want one on your arm like i got  darin see this head on my helmet  travis yeah  darin put it up there because this will cause true terror in any goblin again no offense to you  travis thank you well get it later we should probably get after them /none/  darin take this helmet and do it as we run you are a true artiste  laura but we got to take a short rest though right while we were getting our tattoos though  was that a short rest  matt okay so you take a short rest outside of the chambers of warchief barfta who has been  trying to get you to leave for the past 20 the chamber is just in flames around him hes just  sitting there drinking like leave me  darin we have technically we are outside the room technically we /none/ have left he agrees  matt smartass  sam do i get ki points back  matt you do  sam all  matt yep  sam holy moly im so powerful wow  darin must we roll to get hit points back  sam hit dice it will say right there  darin oh well thats nice  laura whats shrak mean again is that a dick  sam no shrak is feces  matt excrement  laura okay a gronk is a dick  sam a gronk is a dick how will we chase after these bad guys /none/ are we going to ride on something  or should we just walk do we need a cart  travis do we have any mounts available  darin do we see any carangors  matt you do have in this encampment three carangors that are caged feral they havent  been broken yet but they are currently caged in the corner you could see a few beastmasters that  roam about as you walk up to approach and take a look you see one of them has a pike with this long  slivering piece of meat that has a /none/ little bit of skin on it still and you think may have belonged  to one of the uruks that just got killed in the fray and just throws into the cage immediately  this extremely large hyena doglike hybrid beast starts tearing it apart getting gore everywhere  travis see im afraid that would be us if we tried to ride them  sam are you scared of a carangor  travis very much so yeah i mean look at them  sam ive killed so many carangor  travis i havent  sam i havent either  laura /none/ you could ride on my back i could give you a piggyback ride  travis not that i need it but i will accept  laura because i think were too big to ride this scatagorse  sam the scatagorus  laura yeah  darin yeah close enough  sam all right well then we will go on foot right  laura i dont know are we too big  matt i mean its a big beast you can certainly try  sam is anyone good with animals  travis and darin nope  laura and sam maybe we should /none/ walk  laughter  matt as you guys are having this conversation you see one of the beastmasters is by the cage  looking at you with his head turned to the side curious as to what youre talking about and  immediately this claw grabs him and pulls him against the cage screaming as one of the jaws  grabs and tears his shoulder off from the back he goes grunting the other uruks start hitting it with  pikes from the side of the cage to calm it down but its already torn the guy apart youre like /none/  this is bad  darin were walking we are walking  matt okay so as you guys exit the outside of the fortress on the outskirts of nargroth you begin  to make your way eastward towards the mountains in the direction where you saw these fleeing  goblins whos helming this journey who wants to be tracking eastward  laura well he has the head on his helmet so he can probably see farther than the rest of us  darin yes but the eyes are missing if you gave me a couple of your eyes we could /none/ stick them in there  laura heres a couple they dont match but thats all right  darin its just eyes so ill take out a couple of the eyes i take off my helmet and i put them  in and now i am known as mozuu the chosen the tracker with the helmet that has the head with  the eyes in it currently  laura upgrade im going to take skak and im going to sit him on my shoulder  travis frantic noises  matt as hes slowly carving well no if you have the helmet /none/ on to track he cant carve into  it as youre moving so a choice has to be made  darin well the eyes will be able to see as youre carving you tell me what they see we go  that way  travis im to interpret the eyes  darin exactly that what makes us a team thats what makes us the forcs apparently  all the forcs  matt so i want you to make a dexterity check  travis laughs that was good oh thats a million 22  matt 22 you of all the scars /none/ youve carved across the group you saved the best for mozuu  even though its a bumpy ride on the back of an olog its a beautiful display on this helmet  travis its got mosaic work filigree its really nice  matt youre really proud of it and also roll a perception check because youre now the person  interpreting the eyes  travis oh good minus two 14  matt 14 okay so as you glance about and you take a little while heading forward you begin to  find the easiest path up the mountainside as opposed /none/ to having to climb cliff over cliff you  guys eventually hit the base of the mithram spur mountains and begin to slowly pull your way up  the occasional cliffside but for the most part youve managed to maintain a fairly easy to climb  switchback path that has been walked through this mountain range a number of times make a survival  check for me please  laura you hear those people screaming in the background  sam and darin yes  travis i literally rolled a zero two minus two  matt all right so as you /dung/ guys begin to curl up and down the edge of this mountain range you  can see the large fortress of nargroth in the distance and the outskirts of the one small watch  fortress on the outside of it the three of which dot its exterior the one furthest to the east  that you just came from begins to disappear over the high mountain spires and now in the dark  skies the black of night just the faint glow of orangered in the distance as mount doom  occasionally flares up into the clouds ahead it is /dung/ very dark thankfully i believe most of you have  some form of darkvision  travis 60 feet  laura and torches  matt yep great so you guys are able to make your way through following the wonderful  direction of skak on top  travis the eyes speak often they lead us forth  sam ive noticed that one of those eyes is a wolfs eye and the other is an acorn is that  going to  travis no shouldnt make any difference both the land and the beast speak to me through the eyes  matt /none/ leading you with absolute confidence up the side of this mountain path  darin because an acorn is technically a seed and you cant spell seed without see  travis i dont know if thats right  darin see is see seeeddddd is seed therefore you could if you wanted to  travis extrapolate  matt and its at that moment laughs arby as your large foot hits a soft mound of dirt a large  one one about maybe 25 or so feet across your foot hits it the mountain seems to give way  for a moment into /none/ a little bit of a plateau and there looks to be packed ash and dirt that fills  this small vicinity and while you were conversing and listening and following the direction of skak  your foot hits this soft mound  laura hey somethings down here its softer i start stomping on it  matt okay i would like all of you to make an intelligence check please  darin five  sam seven  laura 14  travis 18 this is new for me guys  laughter  matt so as all of you begin to follow suit /none/ with arby and stomping on the soft dirt youre like  wait weve raided some of these before  travis wait a second yeah weve all got experience with this  laura and sam what is it  matt you hear this soft growling sound as you watch these tiny humanoid creatures with long  thin arms and legs hairless gray skin begin to pull their way out of small holes and tunnels in  the sides of this mound you watch as ghouls began to emerge now from the recent disturbing of their space  laura i hate ghouls /none/  sam but the forcs can take them forcs its dinner time  matt because you rolled so high on the intelligence check you do know that they have a hard time with  bright light however i would like you all to roll initiative because they are immediately  lunging towards you snarls  travis remember they have a hard time with bright light  sam laughs thank you lady guinevere  laughter  laura you had a torch right in your hand  darin were using darkvision some of us  sam totally black  darin yep lets /none/ go back in time did anyone  laura i did mention torches but i didnt say i pulled it out  matt you can see four of them have emerged and it looks like more are making their way out so  all right initiative order what do you have  darin 11  sam 17  laura 11  travis 18  all ooh  matt all right skak youre up first as you kept the helmet in your hand youre like  hesitating  travis how far away are they  matt there are two of them that /none/ are ten feet from you now rushing in your direction and a few that are  about 25 or 30 feet on the other side of the mound that are now climbing over it and  darting towards you you move first though so theres nobody quite in range or no one whos  attacking you yet  travis i would like to take out one of my acid vials and im going to throw it from atop  your shoulders at the two ghouls coming forward  matt perfect okay then  travis using acid splash  matt so /none/ as you chuck it out there are two of them that are side by side that are emerging on  the opposite side within range so you could probably hit them both so i need you to go ahead  and roll actually no its a dexterity saving throw on their point okay so strangely enough  they both succeed an 18 and a 20 you throw it and theyre so fast as they dart past theyre  small and theyre wiry and theyre lively and as soon as you throw and lob it the both just separate  and /none/ it splashes harmlessly on the ground below them you see the acid burn up no effect unfortunately  travis can i use my bonus action to nimble escape and i want to jump off your shoulders and hide  matt sure yeah so well say you dart off and go ahead and roll a stealth check  travis nice 20  matt okay good to know so thats you youre hidden that ends skaks turn eden youre up  sam so theres two close together and two others  matt well theyve now separated a little bit theres four now /none/ rushing right in the front and  theyre somewhat close you can get in between two of them and hit both  laura do we all have darkvision  matt i believe you do yeah  sam and my flurry of blows can that be used on multiple targets all right so ill run up to the  first and quarterstaff attack  matt go for it  sam ooh yeah 23 to hit  matt 23 hits yeah go ahead and roll damage  sam seven  matt seven points all righty so as you rush up and by /none/ the way as an ologhai youre a big  trolllike entity the quarterstaff in your hands is like that long its like a tiny little baton  you smack it and you dislocate its shoulder and it gives a horrible pained sound as it does so its  hurt pretty bad these things are not very hardy theres just a lot of them  sam all right i will flurry of blows and strike him with my hand  matt all right go for it  sam ew 11  matt 11 does not hit unfortunately youre too confident at /none/ this point as you swing a second  time it ducks below missing  sam ill strike again with my hand yelps oh that ones better 19  matt 19 go ahead and roll damage  sam six points of damage  matt and with that you slam down and crumple its head into its shoulder it makes  this gurgle sound as it falls to the ground and theres one whos now rushing up behind you that  you can move into and get your final attack if you want  sam with my hand right my bonus  /none/ matt hand or your staff  sam all right well then i will quarterstaff him in the gut  matt all right go for it so you run up and use that momentum  sam oh yeah 18 plus seven ooh 25  matt that hits yeah roll damage  sam one so five  matt five points of damage all right so it hits him and he gives this guttural loss of air sound  but its still standing without an issue  sam is that a part of the flurry of blows attack or is that when i /none/ bonus attack  matt well the flurry of blows becomes your bonus you do two attacks instead of one with your  bonus is what flurry does  sam okay so if i hit someone with a flurry of blows he must succeed on a dexterity saving throw  or be knocked prone  matt oh shit with an eight no he does not so the one you slam while it doesnt kill him it  knocks him off his feet and it falls to the ground its clawing to find purchase to get  itself back to its feet /none/  sam all right forcs appetizer course is over i dont know how far i can take this metaphor  laughter  darin all the way till dessert is what i think  sam salad course  matt with that the remaining five or the four that arent currently prone rush up the one  that was prone gets up with its turn and its going to go ahead and strike at you it cant move  anywhere because its no longer prone somethings going to strike at you okay thats  a 23 to hit  sam yes  /none/ matt you take seven points of slashing damage from its bite attack sorry its from the  scratch attack as it strikes across you with its claw it rolled max damage its going to attempt  to bite at you thats a nine which does not hit you so it strikes you with its claw then goes to  bite you and its jaw hits your armored flesh your hide and cant seem to pierce it another one  rushes to the side to try and gang up on you it tries to climb onto your back that is a /none/ 16 to hit  whats your armor class  sam 17  matt 17 it jumps onto your back but it cant pierce your hard hide while another one a third  one is going to rush up behind you as well that one is going to be a 21 to hit  sam yes  matt and that one takes you take three points of slashing damage as it rakes into your back and  it gets up onto your shoulders its going to attempt to bite down on the top of your head with  a ten as /none/ it bites down once again it just cant seem to bite through your thick olog hide those  are the three ghouls that are on you two more emerge from the mound and began rushing in  however they cannot get into combat right now and still attack the lets see theres two more  one of them is going to rush towards you mozuu and ones going to rush around trying to look  laura sings  matt oh that wouldve been amazing  travis no more eagles  matt laughs good that works to your favor actually no /none/ thats going to be two on mozuu  because they dont know where you are and theyre a little scared of you at the moment all right  thats going to be a 21  darin 21 points of damage  matt no 21 to hit whats your armor class  darin yeah it hits because im an 18  matt all right so you take two points of slashing damage from the scratch and 18  darin yeah  matt you take three points of piercing damage from the bite the other one that swung up to you  /none/ because this one is now currently flanking you with the other one that is a 23 to hit which i  believe hits and then 24 to hit 18 and 19  sam mozuu they have chosen you  travis yeah laughs  darin its part of my name  matt thats seven points of slashing damage plus an additional 1d4 so you get an additional one  so its eight points of slashing damage and second strike is going to be damagewise  counting ooh nine points of piercing damage  travis ding  laura how are you at /none/ whats your health at  matt theyre ganging up on you you get the sense individually they are not very dangerous  necessarily they go down pretty quick but when they gang up its bad and theyre ganging up on  mozuu right now  travis ive heard this before about ghouls  matt so ending that turn arby youre up  laura im going to you said theyre susceptible to bright light  travis bright light  laura all right im going to pull out my torch and im going to hold it in the same hand with my /none/  maul because i got big hands and then im going to swing it  matt okay im going to say it takes an action for you to light the torch  laura oh i have to light no i didnt light it as a bonus action i took it out but i didnt  light it  matt okay so youre just holding it okay  sam hoping thatll be enough light  laura yeah and then im going to try to hit the ones that were attacking mozuu  matt so you lumber up with an unlit torch /none/ clasped in your hand with your maul and youre  going to attack the ones against mozuu all right roll for the first attack  laura laughs okay  sam it must cast some light  laura yeah i mean thats what torches do  laughter  laura twenty i suck at this particular number combination 21  matt 21 hits yeah go and roll damage  sam its a 20 and a one  laura yeah  darin apparently its forever  laura ooh thats good thats 15  matt 15 points of damage  laura yeah  matt /none/ with one strike you splatter this ghoul across the mound you see its arms and legs go  flying apart as its torso is crushed and destroyed its in pieces  laura im going to attack another one  sam does the torso light the torch  matt nope laughs its important to know  laura 11  matt 11 just hits  laura yeah oh i get to reroll that yes 14  matt 14 points of damage you splatter a second one you come swinging and with each hit the one  to the left and the one /none/ to the right of mozuu are both turned to absolute unliving matter  laura so theres two more of them on mozuu theres two more on mozuu  matt no the two that are on mozuu are gone theres three that are now climbing up on eden  that have been trying to strike through  laura im going to turn im going to use my action surge to hit two more to try to hit them  matt all right so you use the last bit of your movement this will be the end of your  movement to /dung/ get to eden but you can attack two that are on him  laura thats 14  matt 14 hits  laura ive got to keep that eight five is eight plus five is 12 13 no  matt eight plus five is 13 thats correct  laura 13  matt you actually slam the maul into the side of eden eden you take just a simple three points of  bludgeoning damage but the ghoul that was currently clasped onto your side is smeared  against you there is a spray of dark crimson  laura ive got one /none/ more attack here ooh thats good that definitely hits 24  matt yeah roll damage  laura ooh 15  matt 15 and with that you splattered the one on the other side the back shoulder portion of eden  and this time you dont slam it into eden you just swing wide and you baseballbat slam  it sending it flying 30 40 feet arcing through the sky ghoul screaming theres still the one  of top of his shoulders you got four in one round  laura yeah youre welcome  sam i dont know what that means /none/  matt while this is happening mozuu its your turn  darin there are two in the distance  matt there are two more theres one that got up on the ground thats in front of eden theres  one thats rushing in and theres one thats on top of edens shoulders right now  darin ill go for the one thats on top of edens shoulders i want to pull him off and bite and  try and rip his throat out  matt okay  travis wow said so casually i would like to bite and  matt /none/ as you rush up to the side to grab it make a grapple check roll an athletics check  darin okay oh 12  matt the ghoul rolled a natural one without an issue you peel the ghoul off its back do you  want to lunge for its throat all right roll an attack  darin 12 plus my strength  matt plus your strength yeah  darin 15  matt 15 okay roll a 1d4 and add your strength modifier and damage to it  darin that would be 16 my modifier three so six  matt six /none/ points of damage so as you pull the ghoul off its screeching you grab it by the  back of the head pull it back sink your teeth into its throat and tear a chunk out its not a  mortal wound but now its missing part of its throat and its screeching goes from a screech  to moan this horrible sucking sound as part of its trachea is now exposed  darin i get another attack it says you can make two attacks  matt oh right  darin when you make an attack action you can make /none/ two attacks i want to attack his throat again  matt go for it he has a bonus action war cleric  darin thats a 15 that is an 18  matt that hits roll another d4  darin thats another six  matt as you pull away the first piece of flesh you spit it to the side as this horrible sucking  screech sound happens you reach down this time getting a larger bite into its throat and as you  pull back you leave nothing but the spine left behind and the ghoul goes limp in your /none/ grasp as  you have the rest of its throat in your maw  darin wow ive finally lived my dreams  laughter  matt all right that ends your turn mozuu that brings it to the top skak youre up  travis i jump out from behind where im hiding and i load my crossbow at the one thats running  and i pull the trigger  matt go for it you have advantage because it does not see you  travis oh 21  matt 21 all right roll for damage  travis 12 right no sneak attack /none/  matt no sneak attack because it didnt see you you were hidden  travis right oh it is sneak attack counting 21  laura holy moly  matt as its rushing were talking 28 days later sprinting zombie level falls limp unmoving onto  the mound the bolt went through its throat and chest area  travis pants forcs  laughter  travis forcs  matt you watch as three more begin to emerge from the sides of the mound this looks to be  essentially a hive home to these and you have no idea how many are /none/ inside three more emerge  eden youre up  sam maybe we should go seems like they keep coming maybe we should run  travis yes i remember they have a weakness to bright light and they live in hives we should go  laura dont worry i have a torch  travis dont light it i think its an unlit torch  laura well you said it was susceptible  travis dont hurt yourself its okay we should go mozuu  sam mozuu do we have your blessing to flee  darin look a lot happened just now  /none/ travis whats on your face  darin its my face its called fear and a leader cant show fear im not leader anymore  youre leader  sam im leader you hear that bow before me  darin i bow before him you gave me eyes and yet i didnt see i didnt see this hive and i almost  died im not leader im not fit to lead the forcs  laura all right  darin youre leader as well  laura all right  darin youre leader too i follow all three of you  travis you cant /none/ have two leaders  darin theres two things i know the forcs have three leaders and one follower theres three  things i know that follower is me and thats it  matt eden while this is happening its your turn and youve been bowing to him  sam hes been bowing to me im going to run  matt okay you still have one on your shoulders by the way  sam oh  darin a lovely speech  matt as its trying to claw and bite you  travis delineating responsibility  sam im going to run and /none/ hope he falls off like a big bucking bronco ill use my step of the wind  to go faster and jump really far  matt okay you full run dash action and use that to move another movement you watch as this  giant ologhai like wile e coyote leaves behind a cloud in his shape behind because youre moving  that fast i will make sure the ghoul has to make a save to stay on with a natural two for a  strength save no the ghoul stumbles off tumbling onto the ground behind you gets back /none/ up  onto its feet you start bolting in an eastern direction ending your turn its now the ghouls  turn they cannot catch up to you the one that gets up tries to run after you but its slowly  behind the other three now begin to emerge and theyre now rushing up towards you seeing that  you smashed so many of them in the past rounds three of them six attacks on you they rush in  the first ones going to go for a scratch and bite 12 and a seven  travis wow  matt /none/ second one up behind you that is 18 all right with that because theyre ganged up on  you they do more damage that is six points of slashing damage  sam are we leaving  darin youre leaving  sam i thought that was the plan  matt its their turn now and then they get to go  darin bye  matt thats a 21  darin a leader leaves  matt you take five points of piercing damage as this one claws and bites into you and then that  is a 17 no and a nine /none/ so theyre clawing and jumping onto you theyre scraping at the armor but  its keeping most of them at bay they get a few hits but its not too bad that ends their turn  that brings us to you arby what are you going to do  laura i guess im going to try to kill these things that were attacking me  matt okay youve got three of them on you right now theyre climbing all over you  laura ooh i thought that was really good but it wasnt its 18  matt 18 still hits /none/ roll damage  laura cackles 16  matt 16 theres one to the side you grab it by the head and smash it in your grip and throw it to  the ground with a slopping sound your next attack  laura im going to look down and try to hit the one thats at my feet thats a natural one  matt you try to reach for him but hes just out of reach so you start spinning to try to get a  better reach but hes attached to you so he spins too you end up going /none/ in circles for the  rest of your round chasing your tail  laura eden i thought i was supposed to run but i cant run  sam why  laura theres ghouls  matt mozuu youre up  darin it worked once im going to grab him and try to rip his throat out  matt okay now you have a taste of ghoul in your mouth you rush over to arburuk make a grapple check  darin grapple is plus what  matt its an athletics check  darin oh great 20  matt 20 all right rolled /none/ a 19 actually 18 plus one for its strength its not enough so you  manage to grab and pull it and barely peel it off and youre going to try to go for its throat  again roll an attack  darin 18 plus three that is a 21  matt that hits roll damage 1d4 plus your strength  darin three plus three that is a six we are repeating again  matt all right roll one more time  darin seven so thats ten so that did not  matt ten does not unfortunately you bite one /none/ chunk out of the middle of its clavicle area and  its scrambling against you and pushing against your face as you go for the secondary bite it  jams its hand into your mouth and you gag for a minute and have to pull it out it manages  to stave off the fight for the moment at least that ends your turn mozuu skak youre up  travis how many are left two three  matt there are three theres one thats still stuck to arby theres one thats being held by  mozuu and theres one that /none/ fell off the shoulders of eden as he ran away  travis are any of them within 15 feet of me  matt from where you were youre not that far from arby and mozuu you could probably move in  pretty close yeah  travis i want to try and cast thunderwave  matt thunderwave okay  travis its going to hit you guys isnt it it hits everybody  matt you can aim it in a way that will hit both of them but youll hit hit either one or the other  travis i definitely want to /dung/ try to hit as many of you as possible  laughter  matt you could hit all of them all four you wont hit eden because hes too far away but you  can hit all four of them  sam shouting guys are you coming or what guys  matt perfect  travis may the dark lord grant me a thunderwave  matt what you do is reach into your pouch and find one of those explosives that you had earlier  and you throw it and clench backward i need both mozuu and arby to roll a constitution /none/ saving  throw im going to do the same whats your spell save dc  travis 14  matt they both fail you rolled a ten fail  laura 13  matt fail all of you take 2d8 thunder damage and youre pushed ten feet away roll travis  roll 2d8  travis 13  laura you asshole i mean you glob  matt both of you guys take 13 points of thunder damage and are blown ten feet back as this small  rolling ball explodes in a concussive blast both of the ghouls get scattered into nothing the /none/  sound of the explosion echoes throughout the mountains and both of you guys get pushed back  ten feet almost landing on the ground  travis can i bonus action my nimble escape to hide  matt make a stealth check  travis 15 no 23 stealth is plus ten im used to the other 23  matt all right so as the explosion happens and youre standing right where the ball rolled youre like  shit move back behind the mound and try to stealth and hide okay that ends your turn both  of them are detonated /none/ at this point there is the one across the way that fell off thats trying to  catch up to eden but is too slow theres none currently out in the open but you can hear sounds  of scratching and little voices  laura i cant really hear anything after that explosion  matt thats true the two of you your bells a little rung you hear this as youre hiding up  against the mound right now  travis how many of those explosive orbs did i use all of them or just two  matt well say /dung/ for as many spell slots as you have  travis fair enough  matt all right so that brings us to eden  sam im 80 feet away and my darkvision cant see that far so all i heard was an explosion in the  dark so i drop to my knee and i say as the only surviving member of the forcs i will say a word  to thank the great dark lord for choosing me to carry on the mantle of this mission and i will  keep running as fast as i can away  matt /none/ okay you bolt away this poor little ghoul has no sight of you as that ends your turn it is  now the ghouls turn its like panting its lost and doesnt see you its going to make a  perception check nope it begins scrambling its way back toward the mound  laura does it know where home is  matt well find out the rest of this story is the saddest little ghoul  sam its like benji  matt three more ghouls emerge from the inside of the mound  darin we can take it earth ghouls /none/ are easy thank you sorry  travis some of them are apparently explosive  darin what  travis explosive  matt they emerge but they are not in combat yet arby youre up  laura i think we should run away and i start running away  matt okay  laura as im running do i see the little lost ghoul  matt ill say yes ill say as youre running away its coming back towards you  laura i splat it i want to try to splat it as im running  travis i totally heard law school  /tavern/ darin i passed the bar  laura 26  matt 26 hits roll damage  laura 14  matt all right so this one ghoul who had made his journey back finally sees home and is running  up and sees you heavy footsteps impact and fullon whackamole him into the dirt  laura i keep running  matt you keep running  laura can i use as my bonus action im going to use my second wind  matt go for it you get to heal up some damage all right mozuu  darin question i started hitpointwise at /none/ 44 im now at nine i can perform lay on hands and  heal myself does that take time  matt its an action  darin yeah if its my turn im going to do that  matt okay you can use as many points as you want to heal yourself  darin so if i spend nine hit points to heal as many as i can  matt you have a pool of 25 hit points total and you choose a number of that 25 you only have 25  for the whole day that you can heal with /none/ that but you can do five or ten or eight  darin id like to try for ten  matt okay so you use your action to heal ten hit points mark those ten off and you heal ten  darin great im at 19 minus ten and then i will run  matt okay you go running and bolting off okay so as you guys are all charging youre still  hidden against the mound you see these three emerge from the side and theyre between you and  your allies as youre pressed against the mound  travis /none/ screams i take off running too  matt you go running past one of them it does get an attack of opportunity on you as you emerge  thats going to hit thats a 17 plus five  travis uncanny dodge  matt okay so thats five points of slashing damage which you take half of so thats two but  you go running past double charge okay as you guys are running theyre pretty quick and  theyre keeping pace with you they cant quite catch up to you but theyre following as youre  rushing since youre the /none/ furthest behind make a perception check  travis 11  matt okay after a while you eventually hear the sound subside and it seems like theyre returning  to their mound they dont want to get too far away from their home base  laura they dont want to get lost like some other little ghouls out there  travis wheezes i think they left us behind why do i sound like this  darin they get you in the throat did they  travis yeah were clear  darin sorry thought you were an imposter  travis forgot my /dung/ inhaler  matt as the three of you reconvene you make your way up the path and see one heavy breathing  exhausted eden alone  sam they fought bravely they were my friends they took care of me  darin theyre standing behind you  sam oh im hearing voices again  laura its the dark lord  darin yeah the dark lord is speaking to you now  laura you should probably pick your nose  sam two voices oh god  travis ureden  sam three voices he speaks in mysterious ways oh well ill end it /none/ all right here  travis wait  darin no its us turn around  sam oh hi  darin ologhai right back at you  travis youre faster than i thought  sam hi howd it go  laura we killed them all of them every last one of them  travis she killed five of them  laura i did is that how many i killed  travis yep  sam im sorry i left but when he made me leaver  darin leader  sam leader oh i thought he said leaver  travis made me leaver  /none/ sam all right shall we continue eastward  laura okay  sam which way is that  travis do i know which way is east  matt make a nature check since you guys are a little scattered at this point  travis nature check natural 20 that doesnt help with directions  matt you do that for a moment and realize that doesnt help however you glance over and see the  orange glow of the top of mount doom and that does help you realize ah that is east  travis that is east  matt as you /none/ begin to move in that direction ill let you since youre leading this charge again  with the helmet make a perception check with advantage because of the nature check that 20  gave you a benefit to this  travis perception with advantage or nature with advantage  matt perception with advantage  travis that helps 18  matt 18 you guys have now crested the highest point of this mountain range and are now making  your way down the opposite side of this first ridge as you climb over the edge you glance  over are you /none/ still on the shoulders of your ologhai friend  travis yeah i climb back up  matt you glance over the shoulders and look down just past the shelf and you see this very faint  bit of light tucked in this small outcove in the side of the mountain you glance past and you can  see six uruk figures five of which are bundled up in ramshackle rags small sleeping bag bundles  and one of them has a torch across its shoulder keeping watch they look roughly about the size of  the goblins that you saw /none/ fleeing from the scene  travis shushing i see figures ahead three of them three of them one on guard with a torch  laura do you think we could take them  travis yeah slit their throats while theyre resting  laura wait but im hurt still from the ghouls will you help me  laughter  sam im pretty hurt too and youre hurt as well should we take another rest  laura can we can we rest and watch them while we rest lets sit down for 30 minutes around and  maybe heal a little bit /none/ but then be ready to attack if they get up  travis no we charge in  laura no skak  sam i can heal us if you want and we can keep going  laura yeah  sam all right gather around i will need to use all of my healing potential for this what hurts  laura well my elbows been giving me some problems lately because i think the maul might be  a little too i may be overextending  darin i think were hurt from the fighting that we just did  laura oh well /none/ a ghoul bit me on my knee and a ghoul bit my ankle and another one got up here  around the shoulder but i cant tell if its from the scar that skak gave me  sam i cake some mud onto all of her wounds and heal her 13 points  laura thats good i was down 15  sam well where do you hurt what ails you  darin specifically everything i will take whatever you give o glorious leader i bow to  your healing prowess  sam i will take my hair  laura you /none/ have hair  sam yes i have a little bit i shake off the dandruff make it into a tea that he drinks but  its filled with protein  matt uruk scalp protein  sam yeah that heals 11 points  darin that was the best ive ever had in my life i may be chosen but you youre good  travis dandruff scalp protein  laura gross  sam i keep a little flask of grog ill swig that can i heal myself a bit  matt yeah  sam oh yeah 11 points back up in it /dung/  laura can we run to the restroom  matt i was actually about to say as you guys are taking this moment to heal yourselves up and  prepare yourselves for whatever point of entry to this apparently unaware group of sleeping uruk  traitors are were going to take a break well rest up here for a minute well be back here for  the second half very soon of our journey deeper into the dark depths of mordor  travis the forcs  all the forcs  matt thank you again wb games for this well come
