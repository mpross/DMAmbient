none	  youre so bad at this we will pay someone to teach you in front of a camera  liam he could eventually evolve into michelangelo of painting minis but we will never let him  forget that one  brian i have the picture of it on my phone because i sent a picture to gil and i said can you  paint this and he goes who the fuck i was like will did this himself  marisha i would have been like nah we cant that cant  brian yeah he was like i might need to 
dung	 just bleach it and start all over i said we should do  the same with will  marisha we got that picture and we used it in the first season to shame him in the very first  episode the new season is going to be great  brian it is painter’s guild season two january 8th critical role vox machina origins number  four from dark horse comics will be released digitally on january 24th  liam thats too far away  brian no its a hop skip and a jump grab your copy at digitaldarkhorsecom comixology with 
none	 an x  ibooks with an i amazon kindle nook or google play the fuck is a nook  sam a nook i think is a barnes  noble proprietary kindle  marisha they were a thing before kindle overran them  brian there are a couple of barnes  nobles around still but yeah  sam get yours at ballard’s books  brian people buy their books from ballard’s books waldenbooks hey guys the vox machina d20  set is still out of stock we appreciate your patience as we wait for the restock and will  notify everyone 
none	 via social media as soon as the inventory is in place  laura that’s true but i can say that it’s going to be very soon  sam that is some bullshit  laura no it really is gonna be super duper soon i just talked to fernando today about it and it’s  coming up you’ll be happy  brian a crucial addition to that last update the last batch of the critical role podcast episodes  101 through 115 will be going up on monday january 8th now that’s only a few days away  sam i’m confused 
none	 about that i haven’t recorded any ads for that i should probably do that  brian that’s because we replaced you with a gentleman goes by the name of darin de paul  sam ooh okay  brian he’s more expensive but says here easier to work with  sam i believe that  brian monday january 8th  sam it says it on your card  brian i would not give people halftrue information those last batches there’s no  batches the last batch of episodes will be out january 8th now does anyone who works here know  
none	 and i look at you the new campaign are podcasts going to be released like in groups also when the  new campaign come out for the new episodes  laura how’s that happening do we know yet  brian that’s a great question that’s why i  marisha to be determined says a member of  travis not in groups but were aiming to get them out much more efficiently  marisha i think we wanted to do it yeah more efficiently  brian i say wait till you’re 101 episodes in again and then do it  matt 
none	 they will be happening much more consistently  brian what else do i have to go over yes this is live you know marisha’s guesting on as in ne wisdom  marisha good close  brian this tuesday what is it  marisha asinine  brian asinine wisdom this tuesday the 9th at 900 on twitch  marisha one of our new shows where we debate about really dumb shit  sam marisha  marisha yeah  sam i was asked to be on that show would you be pissed at me if i did that show before your  
none	 signal boost show  marisha considering signal boost has been on hiatus for six months it doesn’t matter  sam i don’t watch the channel  brian yeah we know  sam not a big fan of geek stuff really  marisha no please do it go for it  brian sam did you know that the  sam hey what’s up with marisha’s show  brian we just plugged it for the amount of time it deserved  marisha we wanted to just take a break sometimes we move on this is actually a good question this  is 
none	 a good question because a lot of people will be like why did you cancel this show why did you  cancel that show the answer is there are 1000 reasons why you could and maybe cancel a show and  each show is going to be like unique in its own way  sam is it because i didn’t go on the show  marisha it might be because you didn’t come on the show no honestly we wanted to mix it up a  little bit  brian considering how well certain clips or viral music videos of 
dung	 you how well they do on youtube  you would think a signal boost would have been right up your tiger woods alley guys did you  know the critical role podcast speaking of was one of podbean’s top ten podcasts of 2017 can you  believe it sam did you get an invite to the podbean awards because mine must have been lost in  the mail  sam there was a mysterious bowl of pinto beans left on my doorstep  brian that’s from them that’s the invite it’s inside the beans  sam it’s like a secret 
none	 society  brian yes it’s inside one of the beans  liam i’m offended on behalf of all work no play i know we only do one episode a year  sam side note we’ve had an episode recorded since september that i haven’t edited yet  brian oh boy  matt quality over quantity  brian our questions for tonight are what was left over from the thousands that were sent in for our  wrapup episode dani and courtney are here as they are every week but this time they are  looking the the chat so if 
none	 you guys have some questions they better blow us the fuck away  because in my hand is a stack if you are going to submit one maybe where did the name critical  role come from or matt is dming fun some of those questions maybe we could just leave for  another time the last announcement for tonight is the new campaign starts next week okay  sam thats the most important announcement  brian okay the new campaign starts next week january 11th at 700 i want to begin by asking  how it’s going in the 
none	 creation of the characters whats the biggest hurdle or challenge youre  facing right now coming up with a new person  marisha culture shock  brian tell me about it  marisha were all doing pretty different things it’s like i dont know how to dd anymore  and its scary  laura are we allowed to say what we did  matt yeah every person is doing a session zero at home in private just like a very brief warm up  to feel out the character and if theres anything they want to change before we really 
none	  started the campaign  brian those were not filmed or recorded for all the people who have been asking us none of that  is going to be released at any time  matt our little nuggets just for us to have for ourselves  laura has everybody played  travis no liam and sam are tomorrow  laura oh my gosh so were the only ones who have done it oh gosh  marisha it was so fun oh my god  laura my hardest one is that i kept wanting to say darling as i was talking 
none	 i caught myself do  it out loud one time and i was like ooh i really need to not do that  brian because your disposition is just so naturally pleasant in real life it just flows  its how shitty things just flow out of me all the time  who is happy with the way they rolled besides liam  laura im happy with my roll  liam marisha has got to be happy  brian yeah are you happy did you do okay  marisha i did all right  travis i shit the bed  
none	 brian you shit the bed and then how did you roll  travis not great i got three single digit categories again  matt i think ashleys got you beat  liam but it was all under his watchful eye  matt she didnt roll poorly but you know she has some  laura she rolled some pretty fucking low numbers matt  matt and im so happy she did those are my favorite low stats are awesome  brian its going to play well into the character  matt it really is im excited  sam matt does anyone 
none	 have a stat lower than my lowest stat  matt which ones your lowest again  sam well i cant say  matt you cant say i think so i think ashleys is lower  laura oh i want to know hold up fingers underneath the couch so i can see what it is  brian this is the lamest talk about silhouette watch why are you showing me dont show me im  not looking good guys was there anything from the wrap up episode i know we were here for five  plus hours shooting that but was 
none	 there anything that you wanted to ask each other or ask matt or  matt that you wanted to ask before we jump into the questions  was there anything left unresolved  liam well months ago you hinted a little bit at something but didnt want to go into full detail  behind the scenes because we were still knee deep in it all it wasnt just me a couple of us  asked what would have happened if vax hadnt stuck his dick in the mashed potatoes and stopped  raishan from doing what she was going to 
none	 do and you mentioned that shed  and what would happen next  matt oh right if he hadnt done that then she would have gotten the information she needed from  thordak’s corpse the main thing was she was trying to get to the corpse of thordak to use the  torturous speak with dead spell to extract information from him on where opashs lair was  would have found out information she needed to do the dracolich transition and then she would have  just fucked off shes a long term person once she had dealt with the 
none	 immediate issue of the  disease and her slowly degenerating then she would have taken  all the time she wanted as a dracolich  laura she could be a villain in this next campaign  matt that was essentially what was going to happen yeah if you guys didnt stop her then  she would have gone off on her own done everything she could to be untraceable and  probably would have come up as a villain later in this next campaign but that didnt happen  liam so if we hadnt run blindly in she would have 
none	 poofed  laura if you hadnt run blindly in  matt her whole deal was to let her have a moment with the corpse  travis quit sticking your dick in the mashed potatoes man god fuck  liam thats what campaign two is for thats a beastie boys reference  matt he gets that feature at level 14  travis tater fucker  laughter  liam the new team presumably what you had said to me once was would have run into her having  lorded over where were going to be you talked about her being the next 
none	 shitting all over  everything where were going to be  matt there would have been a 20 year jump she would have had time to establish herself in an  area on the new continent and would have been one of the major players in that area  liam part of her argument during negotiations was ill get what i want and then you won’t have  to deal with me at all ill be gone she would have just pooped on wildemount  matt she would have been like you guys have taldorei thats fine i have ideas 
none	 elsewhere  brian taliesin how’s your campaign for mayor of tucson going  laughter  taliesin ive got a firm shot at it  laughter  marisha poor taliesin it’s been nothing but jokes  taliesin no ive been loving it  marisha i said it looked like he was ending a second year of finishing school  brian absolutely just for that unless you guys had more stuff you wanted to ask each other or  matt if you think of anything speak up  all singing so long farewell  auf wiedersehen goodbye  brian taliesin just for 
none	 being a good sport  taliesin this was my purchase in berlin im quite pleased with it  brian it looks great well just for being a good sport  im going to give the first question to travis  taliesin thank god  brian travis this comes from seth taylor what was one of the most memorable moments for you that  your negative intelligence made a situation go not the way you wanted  travis what was one of the most memorable moments  brian yeah  travis i mean i loved giving three vials of blood to 
none	 the vasselheim trader instead of the two that  he was asking for that was one of the first moments where i was like oh wait theres so  much i can do being this stupid  matt oh yeah man bartering grog thats legendary  travis its so fun and that was the first time where i think laura also was like im going to  fucking kill you  brian the first time yeah liam question from lazygothy little bit lazy little bit gothy  arent we all wherewhen did you first get simon what was the background 
none	  liam oh shit i dont remember matt  pathfinder home  sam did you buy him did you find him  laura no you got him off of somebody  travis did you make him in the forges of nithfluflop  liam thats it thats totally it  laura nithfluflop  liam nithflufloff  matt no he was a random treasure find i dont think i remember specifically when it was  but it was early  sam is that a common item like is that a thing that exists in dd  matt it existed in pathfinder yeah 
none	 it wasnt a powerful item it just became a snake then it went  and bit something and then it became a belt again but i think that good magical items are ones that  are not just useful in the game but eventually become a small portion of your character’s  identity i think thats a good example of that it wasnt entirely useful all the time but every  now and then it was but it just became part of vax  liam he might have actually accomplished something for me once maybe twice  marisha didnt you 
none	 use him to scare some poor merchant or something once  liam i cheered up a kid showed him my snake  matt at the end of the campaign on your way to the forge  liam he was my pet and he was less problematic than vexs pet and it was easy like a belt that  turns into a snake  brian yeah all right i see you going all night because were five marisha at some point in what  im about to read you there will be a question this is from tiamatzx marisha over the 
none	 course of  the conclave arc weve seen keyleth slowly overcome her hesitancy about falling in love with  vax with moments like the talk with vex in the hot springs and pike trying to convince her to be  more comfortable with him this is the part where theres a question what would you say was the  only thing that made her take that chance  marisha i mean it was answered actually in the question  brian fantastic we can  marisha yeah it was a combination of you giving your seal of approval and pike being 
none	 like hey  girl someday were going to die and youre going to regret not loving somebody i was like aw  shit shes right that was basically it  matt i dont remember it like that but i want to remember it like that  brian thats how those characters sounded  marisha actually i think what she said was you should just have fun  i guess it is what she said  matt im pretty sure it is one of sarenrae main stipulations in the religion just have fun  brian you be you  liam also 
none	 when vex finally stop making the hork sound both of our shoulders dropped  laura its true  brian the hork heard around the world a memoir sam question from yourreddog  sam oh clifford  brian yes clifford sam scanlans one man attack on the mansion as a triceratops is one of  my yourreddog’s favorite moments of the campaign how much of that went according to plan  and how much was improvised  sam plan i think the plan was i was supposed to create a diversion by setting a fire until i  realized i had 
none	 no means of creating fire and found myself inside the place as a dinosaur  surrounded by archers there was no plan at all  travis and then the stinking cloud and then the goliath came out  laura i think that was the moment when i was like im in love with scanlan not vex laura  liam yeah your face was manic  for that entire thing  sam that was an hour of just me and matt or felt like an hour anyway  matt that was about an hour  sam it was amazing  brian 
none	 every hour with matt is  sam yeah none of that was planned and it was just so fortuitous and it was one of my favorite  moments of the whole campaign  brian well it was yourreddog’s favorite moment  sam the writers you know they had a different scenario where it was contrived  liam there was a great art in the christmas gallery i dont know the artists name yet  because it was their first art ever it was one of two clockwork pieces done and it shows just  different vignettes and they did in 
none	 a circle the scanbo moment and it had scanlan with the  bandana on his head but holding bigbys hand like a gigantic ak  brian thats amazing  sam and that was fun and that was early on too  matt yeah that was during the whitestonebriarwoods arc  travis im going to kill everyone on this motherfucking house  brian yeah thats right that was back when it was fun taliesin question for you from  baewarden how aware or conscious was percy of everything that vex was doing and saying in an  effort to help him 
none	 out of his orthax and briarwoods induced darknessstupor  taliesin pretty aware i would say he was definitely not the worst he’d been i was not  prepared to where that was going to go there was no understanding of how the guns or the curse  worked at all until it just started happening  matt like a lot of curses do  taliesin there was no conversation about that at all that was just me as player sitting going  what the fuck is happening right now what is this oh no i may have made very poor 
none	 choices i  didnt actually even know where my character was at that point you just went with it man it was  kind of crazy  matt it was like the dms gift like heres a really tragic backstory filled with violence  loosely have fun with it and i was like oh i will  laughter  brian well the best part of doing the show with our brand new fireplace i dont know if we can  get a wide shot here but when im done with the card i can just literally throw it into the 
none	 fire  laughter  brian laura question for you from magestictrinket how fitting vex promised the  raven queen that she would destroy orcus in exchange for vax returning after being killed by  the kraken as we know does she have any plans or concerns about upholding that contract  marisha thats a good question  laura i totally thought that she was going to make us do that i guess im pretty happy that she  didnt because i dont im pretty sure that we wouldve died before we got to vecna if we did go  and 
none	 fight orcus  matt well it was more like i will give you my soul in exchange for my sister is something  that a god could be like okay ill accept that  laura yeah  matt i myself personally will murder the demon prince of undeath in the bottom layer of the  abyss shes like heh sure  laura aw i volunteered all of us together  matt right from her perspective that was something that if orcus became a prominent issue  immediately then maybe shed call it in but for the time being i think 
none	 she also felt that shed  claimed enough attention and happiness from the family here taking vax  laura i also as me and as vex had no fucking concept of what orcus really was when i offered  that like at all it wasnt until afterwards i was like hey matt can i learn some stuff about  orcus because vex is doing a lot of research after she did that and he was like okay he  sent it over and i was like oh no this is impossible  laughter  matt some of the lore stuff 
none	 that you had discovered as vex and you were like oh  laura were doomed  brian that was after you said that  laura yeah  brian that shows your level of commitment to your family that you would choose to take on something  like that i know youre not somebody whos comfortable with compliments but i thought i  might throw that one your way look this ones just blank what the fuck am i supposed to do with  this write my own  travis throw it into the fire  brian toss it into the 
tavern	 fire up next hey guys madam socks reminded us did we not talk about  this on the wrap up a it was a while ago b we were all quite drunk what happened to keyleths  mother we didnt go over that  laura oh thats right we didnt we didnt ever talk about that  brian i know we meant to get to it  marisha i thought we did a talks forever and ever ago  brian i think it might have been discussed on talks  laura i dont remember ever hearing about what happened to 
none	 keyleths mother  marisha shes dead but i guess we dont know how she died  matt well theres elements of the story and campaign that i like to leave somewhat vague for  people who are building their own  narratives and stuff  brian oh i see its all about money for you  matt yeah if you pay me enough ill happily tell you no thats one of the elements i want to  keep vague for the purposes of other writers out there  laura i like to imagine shes alive and living under the water 
none	 with one leg because her leg was  discovered and thats the only thing that was recovered right so i think shes a pirate  with a peg leg now  marisha like a mermaid pirate  laura how fucking cool would that be  marisha shes a mermaid pirate that’s actually kind of awesome  laura that’s what i think happened  marisha oh yeah thats right all they did is discover the leg  matt yeah that was the one remnant of the battle that they found  liam cliff diving accident  laura yeah  marisha that 
none	 would be kind of rad  laura and marisha that would be tight  brian question for you but before that how are you feeling about the new campaign  matt i am super excited and i am really stressed but im super excited i mean ive  disappeared for half of our holiday break was me just working on the campaign im sorry  brian i disappeared for half the holiday break too and im sorry ashley but it was out of my  control they came in the middle of the night  anyway  travis pay those 
none	 parking tickets  matt im excited im finishing up the details of the whole continent map right now  brian we are saving character reveal we are saving race reveal  we are saving all of that for the campaign  matt were holding it for that i want to experience the first game where all the characters  come together as a group the same with these guys  sam you have long arcs planned do you have the first session planned do you have the first three  sessions planned  matt depending on what you guys do 
none	 and where you go because thats always expansive i have the  first six or so episodes of story pretty well beated out from there i have loose arcs to  bridge all those and then i have longterm arcs i have level ten  level 15 arcs already kind of worked out  laura what if we just completely fuck up and  taliesin we could basically do sim farm if you want we could all decide to become sharecroppers  and that could just be the show are we going to do eggplants for this next season  
none	 or are we going to do carrots  matt that would be the fastest sunset of a campaign ever  marisha we just open a bb its great  matt we get to session 12 and im like all right guys as you all gather your harvest for  the fall you look off to the setting sun and think my kids will eat well next year and  thats our campaign thank you for joining us guys  brian probably not going to make a ton of shirts for this one but hope you like the characters  liam 
none	 this game is just cooking mama  laura oh i love that game  matt stardew valley dd version would be great  laura cooking mama taught me how to correctly beat eggs  marisha oh yeah because you actually had to do the little  laura yeah do it and then switch  brian cooking mama was the one that told me the other nuns didnt like me  laughter  brian im sorry i snuck that one in there we did however youre not going to get too much  juice out of us tonight  liam fart 
none	 noise  brian however we did tease you with something over the break le chiffre show it to me at once  we did tease you with something  cheering and clapping  brian put it back up people dont want to see me drink this  laura oh my god do it again do it again  travis yeah put it up show me those legs  cheering and laughter  brian there is a lot going on there  matt oh god  laura those glasses  brian we got to it didnt we  marisha oh look 
none	 at that look at that  laughter  brian oh wow what a great fade wow  laura that whole day its like are we in a cult are we in a cult right now  matt whats incredible is there are elements of that image that arent that different from my  middle school photos i took man ive always been a winner  laura ive seen that  laura dont you have a picture of you on a stairwell or something  brian with a hawaiian shirt on or something like that  matt oh yeah ive got 
none	 a bunch of pictures that the world will never see  marisha yeah i felt like the whole time we were doing the photo shoot because it was like a house  in the valley im like oh theyre going to think this is the weirdest porn  laughter  travis the weirdest porn  marisha throwback  brian yeah the place where that photograph was taken you guys lucked out  laura it was a great place  sam it was the only photograph taken there though  brian no that was it they came they posed they went 
none	 their separate ways  sam yeah it was about a five minute shoot  brian well back to questions about the last campaign  matt yes  brian what oh chiffres going to put something else on the screen side by side lets do the  look there do the face there you go tilt the head to yourthere you go  all yeah  sam i love that were comparing matt to matt two months ago  brian yeah matt two months ago and matt now  matt well this way you can tell just how much weight i 
dung	 gained over the holidays  direct comparison  brian exactly i know dont do a side by side of any of us okay back to questions about the last  campaign tiamatzx is back with a eloquentlyworded question for matthew mercer the  dungeon master percy had gotten two points of corruption before having one reversed by pike in  ‘against the tide of bone’ i guess that’s the title of an episode  matt yeah  brian what would’ve happened if he had gotten more than two  matt i had made a custom kind of 5e version of 
none	 the corruption what were actually called the  taint rules in the heroes of horror but i decided to change that because i knew that this  group would never fly  brian stay taint  liam you shouldn’t have said that shit now  laughter  matt yeah but it’s from the heroes of horror book for the older 35 dd i had used it for my  ravenloft game back in the day i took all those tables and i retooled them to fifth edition and  simplified a bunch of it past two points was a threshold 
none	 where you get to more of a moderate  severity of corruption which you get a mental of physical corruption and so i’d roll  travis a physical corruption on your taint  matt yes see what i got to deal with every week  travis listen  matt you’re making purvan cry  all aw  liam point of order i believe the taint rules apply in this situation  laughter  brian i so bad wish i could read all those cry babies on reddit  complaining about taint rules instead of  matt it would’ve been a 
none	 physical or mental corruption at that point it would’ve been either  a moderate insanity or a physical ailment like the eyes would’ve started to rot away or he began  to have the skin slough off a bit or he could’ve began to have obsessive mental characteristics  travis bring it back man we can handle it that sounds awesome  we’ll totally be grownups about it  laura no that is what it is we’re just not going to call it the taint rules  matt no that’s the corruption points now because it used to be divided 
none	 like a lot of third  and 35 edition rules it was super complicated when it didn’t really need to be so i pulled it  back a bit i was going to put them in the campaign guide but like i said it was based on  the heroes of horror and it was too close to the original settings i may just release them online  and if people want to give them a shot and mess with them them and retool them to yourself  brian something tells me that people will be very interested in that 
none	  marisha we can’t even get through that question without 30 jokes  matt yeah i’m so excited for the new campaign  travis all your hard work is extremely valued  laughter  brian liam question from gibberish vax originally planned to become a paladin of sarenrae  but was forced into the arrangement with the raven queen after meeting both which goddess did he  favor more in the end  liam in the end  brian yeah  liam confused noises i don’t know how to answer that  brian well as kirk douglas wouldn’t help us 
none	  travis go back to two episodes before the end and how did you feel  laura just what does your gut say just answer  liam rq man rq let him be there at the end there at the end  travis good call man  brian yeah that’s true sam  sam yes  brian thehollyphoenix would like to know was scanlan really trying to learn what it’s like to  be on drugs or was he just trying to find a way to numb the pain of the whole kaylie situation  sam hmm i think he 
none	 was the latter numbing the pain he had some issues and was having a crisis  of conscience  liam and taint points  sam yeah and he had  matt so much regret over here  sam he had some grundle issues  brian how do you think i feel  travis this has been its infancy  sam it’s taintancy  travis it’s a dwarf star it’s about to a supernova’s coming  brian liam’s had a month and a half to think of stuff to yell at you right before we go live  matt you’ve never 
none	 seen a faster tpk  brian matt colville this’ll be his favorite campaign kill all the players before episode four  sam he was genuinely seeking a way out of his distress he didnt know who he was any more what  his purpose on the team was or whether he should be on the team or not  so he was looking for a way out  brian i had someone message me im going to share this because i died laughing i had someone  message me and say i know that sam did the whole scanlan drug 
none	 arc thing because that’s what he was  dealing with in real life but do you know if like whatever and i wrote back and i was like  hahaha in all caps because i was like if you knew sam where did you and he was like i  just saw some people had said thats probably whatevers going on’  sam i got in too deep  brian yeah you were in deep man you got in the streets  matt a few weekends in lancaster and you just never were the same  sam part of the 
none	 reason i was late to so many of the shows was i would come in with just gold spray  paint then everyone would be like you have to go clean up just say you were late or whatever  matt it was a very stressful period of the campaign  brian it was man to think that so many laughs came out of such heartbreak  laughter  brian oh man well taliesin run for sheriff of abilene with an answer to this question from  schneeland  sam the captains uniform from lufthansa flight 91  laughter  
none	 taliesin thank you that’s what i was going for  brian oh man in a way taliesin percys greed and carelessness in the sunken tomb were  responsible for vaxs ultimate departure does this ever plague him  taliesin i mean its a long list and also i would disagree with greed  brian a long list of what  taliesin its a long list of things that he feels responsible for because hes the only adult in  the entire world it wasnt greed it was just hubris yeah it was just hubris hes a character  based on 
none	 hubris people make that joke occasionally like immediately going into hell  like okay nobody ever make a deal dont sign anything and then immediately within one hour is  like im going to to make a deal yeah its because this is what you do when you tell all the  kids dont touch the oven this is my oven im going to cook something its what you do when you  think youre the only adult in the entire world it always goes well  matt and taliesin as weve seen  brian the way i used to 
none	 see it was i was always the kind of guy who would steal your drugs and  then help you look for them  laughter  brian what man ill be right over ill be right over im sure you left it in the can of  pringles laura question from subokunotora isnt that the thing no thats did vex know  about tarys feelings for percy if so how did that affect their friendship  travis seppuku  brian thank you  laura i was thinking sudoku  brian i was way off laura  laura i dont think 
none	 so did she know about no she didnt know about him no  brian okay that wouldnt have been something that was discussed  laura yeah that was obviously we talked about that in our best friend hangouts  sam im sure you asked but i dont know if he was really into  laura like who do you like right now  sam he was probably not in touch with his emotions enough to even know  laura right  sam plus you talk a lot  laura i did i imagine that she did a lot of talking 
town	  travis that was a oneway street  brian he had to be a good listener  sam just on and on  travis did you know that and oh my god have you heard  laura i am so glad youre here because nobody ever wants to hear these things  travis i feel like you really understand me  brian matt and laura this came from the internet well these all came from the goddamn  samanthaxyz weve been off for a few weeks this isnt a permanent situation matt and laura what  would have happened if 
none	 vex would have said yes to saundor when she got her vestige  matt oh yeah i think we mentioned that in one of the talks episodes  brian dani said only one person asked that question  matt the offer that would have come with your character type going from humanoid to fey you  would have become a fey creature the tree would have embraced and pulled her up into the canopy  and there would have been this transformation process  brian a feyancé  all oh  brian this is why i write the show folks 
none	 this is why i alone write the popular program critical  role  laura now i am regretting not saying yes  matt you would have transitioned to a fey creature and some of the racial benefits would  have come with that  laura but then some of the downsides too  matt well some of the benefits would have been like a perpetual bark skin you would have had  other fey abilities would have come to you but you also would have gotten vulnerability to fire  damage  laura which would have been real bad  
none	 matt especially in the later battles  laura yeah i would have been dead fighting thordak  theres no way i would have survived those  matt and then you would have been bound to saundor in which case he would have become a  patron for the remainder of the campaign to you or until you rebelled in which case that would  have gone i dont know where that would have gone  laura super south  matt probably pretty bad but yeah you would have bound yourself to a notsogood person  laura yeah but i would 
none	 have gotten some sweet tree loving  marisha yeah you would have had those nice curvy tree hips yeah  travis sweet tree loving  laura saundor i would have gotten some saundor loving  brian may be a better way to word it i picture some bad things happening with those trees from  the second lord of the rings travis  laura ooh theres got to be some fanfic online  brian there is  laura some ent fic yeah  matt guess what were googling at break  brian yep not going to be a break unless 
none	 you want one  matt oh no keep going  brian do you want a break  taliesin thatll be the 90 minutes after this 90 minutes  brian travis cardamonelaw wants to know what was grogs character you played in the last  campaign fascination with the lycans about was he just wanting to tap more into his primal  side  travis what was the  brian fascination with the lycans  travis oh yeah i think he just what was the name of the big alpha lycan  matt oh in the feywild  travis ukurat  
none	 marisha ulrich  matt no not ulrich i cant remember off the top of my head  travis yeah i cant he was really in the face of scanlan right when he got there and grog took  issue with that and so i wanted to pick a fight but i was trying not to blow up too fast and get  us all into trouble and then i got petrified by a bunch of faeries so that didnt go well but  after that i think grog just realized that there was maybe more to tap into  plus 
none	 travis loves werewolves  laura yeah i was going to ask when are you going to say that part  liam that was my followup question what percentage is travis and what percentage is grog  travis oh it was 99 travis wanting to get werewolf art of grog  matt so internet make that happen  laura yeah did that ever happen did you ever get werewolf grog  travis yeah i saw it i saw some stuff i even got some minis while we were in i got three  werewolf minis in australia  laura thats right 
none	 i remember that  sam speaking of petrified how many fights were you in as grog where you were totally taken out of  the fight by being bamfed away frozen solid killed instantly turned into a dummy  turned against us  brian check critrolestats later and see if thats a thing  sam its got to be half right  matt oh its not half by any means  liam no but its the only way for the dm to get at him  matt well it depends on what youre fighting if its an intelligent creature it 
none	 knows what the  biggest threat is the sevenfoot eightfoot guy with the giant axe who looks like he could take  anything you throw at him im not even going to damage him just pop get out of the fight  travis okay bye  marisha you got grappled in that not kevdak the beholder  laura kvarn  marisha kvarn thank you  sam yeah in a holding cell or something  marisha yeah you got stuck for most of it  laura the mime box  matt it depends on who youre fighting a lot of things 
none	 that are not very intelligent will still go  after grog and be like ugh hes just not going down  liam wasnt he also grappled by something in the fight with the elder brain like you got too close  to a cage and got snagged by something in the cage  laura thats what he was talking about  liam oh thats kvarn  matt yeah there were two of kvarns experiments in cages anyone got close they would just  grapple and hold them to the cage  travis i had to be all curious and see 
none	 what was in there i was like ooh allies clang  groan help then i got stuck there forever  marisha you were just rolling so bad i remember that should have broken out man  laura you were just rolling so bad  travis we were really good at strategy at that point we were the avengers on point  laura no that was some good strategy in that fight  travis we got fucking lucky  sam we got worse at strategy as we went  liam but this is the year that we reclaim dignity  laughter 
dung	  travis gif that  brian says the guy who yells out taint whistle three seconds before we go live  laura hey thats going to be the first one  brian matt we had to mine really deep for questions for this thing you know when we did  the original thing and i found a gem and by i i mean dani found a gem only asked by  thehollyphoenix what does the moon hammer do  matt oh right  brian literally 10000 people show up at my house asking me about the goddamn moon hammer  
none	 travis mary gave me a moon hammer  sam did you use it  laura he never used it  travis no well it had to be used under the moon apparently but we rarely fought under  moonlight but i dont know what it did  liam its a plus one hammer  matt well naturally it was a plus one hammer and then when you brought it under full moonlight  it would empower the hammer what it would do is it would give it a charge that would allow you to  cast improved invisibility on yourself 
none	 or another target until it was charged again it wasnt some  grandiose powerful item  travis it didnt turn me into a werewolf  matt no that would have been cool but it didnt make sense for what zahras  travis i would have ripped my clothes off and run out of this studio right now i would have beat  myself to death during the rest of the stream if that was true  matt zahras enchantment capabilities werent super powerful so she can craft something that  was somewhat useful given the circumstance  laura probably at 
none	 this point shed be able to do some pretty badass  matt by now yeah but at the time limited to enchanting something with a one charge improved  invisibility  travis improved invisibility is not bad i never went invisible  matt no especially if you could use it as a person who was not a spellcaster that was the  benefit of it anybody was attuned to the weapon could then use it until it was recharged again  travis grog would have forgotten he was invisible its okay  laura yeah the minute you attack you would 
none	 have been visible again  travis yells aww  brian matt onceuponapun wants to know speaking of interesting items where and when did sylas  come into possession of craven edge  matt craven edge would have been probably one of the artifacts that the cult of the whispered one  had amassed even while vecna was scattered amongst the planes and trying to coalesce over  time those who followed him all the various remnants that were out there in the world were  collecting things for when he returned there were all sorts of artifacts and items that 
none	 they were  pooling in places where they had the most influence craven edge was one of the most  powerful artifacts that they had recovered when he brought sylas back and the briarwoods had  proven that they were dependable righthand men to vecna he went all right you can use this and  since you are undead by nature and i was responsible for your resurrection sylas you  could ignore some of the penalties of this item  travis the dying part  matt yeah it would have been harder for that to happen to him so 
tavern	 it was just amassed by the  remnants then gifted to sylas when he became one of the higherups within that structure  travis was grog the only one to take craven edge to the limit to its max anime status did he take  him to the ten give it to him  taliesin you maxed out the taint bar man  matt there may have been a handful of other ones that had bankaied in the past but you were the  only one in recent centuries  travis fair enough recent centuries is pretty good  marisha 
none	 good thing pike was there  liam i wonder what sylas toilet chats were like  matt nowhere near as interesting they actually probably had good debates and  philosophical discussions  liam does sylas briarwood even take a shit  matt you know thats a good question  laura is it just blood poop  sam matt doesnt want to reveal anything that might come into play in the next campaign  brian yeah guys a couple of things he keeps really close to the chest just in case sylas poop  was something we talked about  matt 
none	 there are some great dms guild things i am working on in the future around that so i dont  want to spoil anything  brian sam and matt was there any discussion about how doty was built i know that got asked  about a lot  sam how it was built it was part of the artificer class to have a something  matt a mechanical automaton that would be his companion  sam before i knew that and before he proposed the class to me artificer because i didnt know what  it was i had proposed 
none	 to him a rich guy who travels around with a biographer who buys all of  his gear and has no actual skill and he was like ive got it artificer and you have a robot  assistant i was like can he write and he was like yep done  matt yeah it was a perfect union the more you told me about the character i was like oh well  this just came out very recently on unearthed arcana  sam yeah  matt it worked out great  sam yeah it worked out great i dont know 
none	 about that class so much it seemed like it peaked i  dont know how much  matt its in the testing phase it definitely isnt a powerful class it is a utility  interesting class i can see certain builds that would be powerful but  laura i guess a support  matt yeah a support and toolbox type class  marisha your crown jewels saved me when i jumped off a cliff that was great  liam storywise when he was a strapping young buck was he taking physics and engineering  classes tutors  sam sure yeah 
none	 tutors  liam was it lawrence who taught him how to make doty  sam i dont know what lawrence taught him i actually thought that lawrence was more of a  literature tutor of romance languages or whatever but he definitely had all the best tutors  brian who do i want to talk to more in this moment matt  liam ashley is not here brian  brian i know erin bradshaw wants to know what were the plans of the illithid after vox machinas  escape would theydid they consider taking over kraghammer  matt the illithid 
none	 rarely want to get closer to the surface they prefer to bring things to them  they expand slowly from an inside standpoint conquering a location isnt as important as  building up power to base and then possibly jumping to a new plane or a new society they are  one of those weird alien colonizationtype species that jump between worlds the far realm  gets real interesting folks  liam and all underground when they dimension shift its just beehives under the earth  matt for the most part it depends on where theyre going theyre all about 
none	 enslavement and  mindcontrol and fleeing their hunters which are like the githyanki there are other species out  there that are constantly hunting and trying to eradicate them so they have this combination of  wanting to be as unseen as possible and then drawing things into their fold and controlling  them probably they were pulling things that got too close maybe eventually if kraghammer became a  huge issue they would maybe core it out and destroy the people and then leave the ruins but i  dont see them hanging as close to the surface as 
none	 kraghammer was  laura just like making some bedrooms in there and summer homes  matt yeah with some nice shawls or sweaters  brian i dont understand why my friends who dont watch critical role that tune into this say that  they are confused with answers like that question for everybody from myurnaoneshot its  as close as we are going to get gang what happens with the slayers cake does vox machina  stay involved with it  marisha we loosely talked about this  laura yeah i think they opened up chains  marisha yeah we 
none	 said they franchised it the next place would be emon  laura yeah  sam theyd release a cookbook  laura eventually an ankharel location  marisha 100  taliesin eventually theres like two a block you cant escape them  sam they have a low price point option sc2  marisha well part of my honey heist game that was part of the whole easter egg because it was a  year or two after everything had closed i dont think we ever actually got into this part of the  prize for winning the honey contest was that 
none	 youd be able to sell your baked goods and your honey  taxfree remember vex being like we have to go win this shit and then open up our next chain  laura taxfree  marisha yeah in westruun i think in my head we were trying to start making a name for  ourselves as the slayers cake in westruun  brian wow thats pretty awesome  laura plus think about it theyre friends with gilmore so hes telling them how to do stuff  they got to like  liam every gilmores glorious goods should have a little 
none	 slayers cake inside it  laura like barnes  noble with a coffee shop  marisha oh my  marisha and laura yelling thats what happened  laura thats canon  brian speaking of gilmore and his glorious goods  matt as gilmore yes you rang  brian people want to know especially the florist friar what a great name how did gilmore react  to vaxs death  matt oh terribly he was heartbroken just because  brian i was so hoping you were going to say he went who  laughter  matt even though longterm things didnt 
none	 pan out for them he still cherishes the time they did  have and the friendship he forged thereafter with everybody so hes heartbroken for both his  connection with vax and for the rest of vox machina and other people whose lives hed come in  contact with hes very thankful for the time he had the whole postcampaign for gilmore was a lot  of selfreflection he was very much this selfstarted wanting to prove to the world that  he can succeed and be as good as he can and had these dreams of perpetual expansion and 
none	  franchising he backed off that a little bit after all the events of the campaign and just focused  on small local shops and staying on taldorei  laura youre screwing up our slayers cake  matt im sorry  marisha it doesnt work anymore  matt well no hes an expansion of your territory you guys can go wherever you want  brian after he got famous from that meme it all went  matt yeah exactly  laughter  matt enchanter bae  brian yeah after he got famous from that he did his own thing  
none	 matt i think vaxs death and the whole events there especially in the tower at the end a lot  of selfreflection a lot of showing more appreciation to sherri and the people that helped  him build what it was and talking to his parents more often  laura yeah thats great  brian liam how does his sentiment about that nonexistent person resonate with your sentiments  about your own nonexistent person  liam oh man tainted love is a complicated thing  brian just to remind people out there these are fictional characters despite how close you 
none	 might  get to them  matt its just fictional from your standpoint man its been our life for three years  brian i just mean when i get death threats because i didnt ask enough questions about  gilmore hes not real what is real is your lack of life  all aww  brian im just kidding i plan to read a list of screen names at the end of it your reaction  liam sighs i mean he feels guilty about leaving everybody he didnt regret anything he did in his  life that was stupid and 
none	 there was so much but leaving people behind were his biggest regrets  for a long time and i said this at some point like six months ago that his biggest regret was  disappointing gilmore that was eclipsed by disappointing keyleth and leaving the family but  gilmore is a huge thing for me liam i mean i kissed guys in college you think im pulling this  out of thin air  sam college  liam come here baby  laughter  brian sam was immediately hurt i saw anger hurt  sam give me his name and 
none	 where does he live i will burn his house down  liam his name was kevin harris it was on the  sam did you like it  liam a little bit  brian i kissed guys in college he says  travis did you kiss him or did he kiss you  sam do you follow him on facebook  travis did you kiss him back  liam gilmore was one of many things that was like a huge blessing and surprise that i had no idea  that dungeons and fucking dragons would give to me and i 
none	 loved that i had that story with matt  brian like we talked about last time nobody even expected him to become probably the most beloved  of all the npcs or that he would play such a huge role in campaign at all  liam how many games did we have at home total eleven fifteen  matt seventeen  liam seventeen gilmore was not in the majority of those it was the minority right  matt i think he was in two sessions  laura thats it  matt the one where you met him and the one 
none	 where you guys made the deal that he would sponsor you  guys adventures  liam but he was super memorable and we loved our encounters with him but it wasnt a lot and then  were like oh we hope this npc that we thought was so entertaining and so amazing will show up in  the game and then it evolved rapidly again it just comes from us doing it every week instead of  every week instead of every six weeks  laura we shouldnt have eaten all of those beans and stuff before this  travis 
none	 are you saying that i shouldnt have eaten all those beans  laura no because thats what there was to eat right it was beans  matt it was seventeen home sessions but the home sessions were like six to ten hours they were  super long home sessions  brian but im thinking about the home game that im doing with mary and steve and everybody and  were coming up on almost that number and to think of having to go weekly online playing in  front of like fuck no that’s terrifying to think about  laura 
none	 i dont feel like your sessions are as long as our were right  brian some of them can be  laura because we went like twelve hours  brian if i drink and then the dice fall of the table and i have to reroll  laura brother we had a twelve hour game  marisha yeah we got there at like ten and we went until like ten  liam that feels right as well like all day feels right  brian yeah we do like the big sunday ones now where we drink mimosas yeah marys usually 
none	  throwing up by 1000am but thats just saturday to be honest  matt yeah like i grew with that shit wed do long weekends planned out where wed go to a  friend’s house and wed game all saturday sleepover and game all day sunday  it was amazing  laura that sounds amazing  matt i miss those days  liam laura and marisha big bear  liam you used to also have to corral us every game too for like the first hour it would be  like ah and we would be catching up and drinking 
none	 mimosas and youd be like  matt all right guys we’ve got to play get back to the table  brian now we see each other so often its like so what have you been doing since 200pm  laughter  marisha how was your shower and walking the dogs that was good okay cool  brian matt mike mahathy wants to know dont laugh it makes me laugh travis who was the  mystery person who contracted the clasp to abduct vex  matt oh yeah  laura did we ever talk about this yet  liam steve bannon 
none	  matt laughs kind of well there was an individual i didnt have to develop it too far  because you guys didnt go too deep into that plot thread but it was like a lower noble in westruun  who just in passing had a runin with vex and she totally blew him off in a very vex fashion  and he kind of developed this obsession with her and so he would try to find information send  people to follow her it was really a weird fucked up  laura it happens all the time actually  
none	 matt yeah and so the story with that was  marisha as vex im such a hazard  matt yeah hed try and court her shed knock it away hed have her followed  brian sounds like me and ashleys relationship  matt yeah well thats kind of what i was hoping to show you this later  liam she is a relentless stalker  brian she is yeah  matt and so he hired the clasp and said could you please bring her to me and that was when vax  had his first runin with the clasp he 
none	 noticed this guy was following her took him out and in  doing so himself was taken by the clasp and inducted into it as his means of paying back the  debt of knocking out one of their members  liam which was the pike and vax game at home  matt no  laura this was way before that  matt this was a whole off camera storyline  liam wasnt that the setup for the pike and vax game  matt it was the setup for it but it was your backstory to how you got involved 
none	 with the clasp  and got your branding and everything there because at the time this is really messed up so  you had talked with the spireling there at the time in westruun and told the story about how  this was your sister and you were protecting her and everything and you offered yourself like  whatever i can do to pay this debt back so that this doesnt happen let me know  laura take me instead you spireling bitch  liam youre welcome  matt the guy who you had knocked out who was following her 
none	 who was also being held down while  you guys were having this back and forth in front of the spireling he accepted what you were doing  then for failing for punishment to the one who failed he pulled out this artifact thats in the  liam yeah tongues stick of tongues  matt its an artifact in the book of vile darkness that is just made of tongues stitched  back to back and it can kind of still move and flex and quiver  laura i remember you talking about this i was like what the fuck 
none	 are you  matt when you touch it to somebody they have to make a saving throw or their flesh gets changed to  whatever form you want it to be  brian oh taliesin has one of those at his house  liam its right here  matt this wouldbe kidnapper that was hired by the clasp and failed his punishment was to be  touched with this and then turned into a replica of vex and then was sent to fill the bounty to  this guy who was obsessed with her  laura so theres some guy 
none	 that looks like me thats probably in a cage somewhere  matt probably  liam is he not dead by now  matt i dont know probably not  laura so if he ever breaks free theres another vex in the world  matt yes who has lived most of their life as a clasp member whos probably really messed in the  head right now  liam that was backstory for one game that ashley and i played because we both missed a home game  matt was gracious enough to give us a game together then three and 
none	 a half years later id  totally forgotten about it were live on the internet and you were like by the way and i  was like what the fuck was the story how did it go i dont know im telling it to laura but i  dont know what im talking about  laura i remember you saying something about tongues and i was like  thats fucking weird bro  marisha hey i have a question what wouldve happened had we not told the clasp to the half  of us that i got blamed for not 
none	 told the clasp to fuck off that thing that all but two of us  agreed to but i got yelled at by percy yeah that one  brian thanks keyleth  matt the clasp wouldve become a source of information and material and fast movement through  emon you guys couldve traveled through their caverns beneath the city  marisha but they wanted access to the city and other levels of the government in exchange  matt they wanted in exchange for that installation in vasselheim so they wouldve been  like we will help you we can help 
none	 get everyone out of the city safely well get them to places  that are safe we can move you in and out of the city anywhere in emon safely we can gather  information for you we can supply you with things you have full disposal of the clasp in  reclaiming emon from the conclave but when all this is done we need you to help us install our  satellite beginnings in vasselheim  laura i think thats acceptable  liam we all survived  marisha i felt like it wasnt our call to be like yeah 
none	 we can give you vasselheim  laura i wouldve done it  taliesin yeah im totally into it  liam we know  marisha keyleth still lingers on in my soul  laura heres my theory about doppelganger vex later in life she found the doppelganger and  hired himher  marisha where are you going with this  laura because the paparazzi gets overwhelming for the de rolo family everywhere you go so shes the  lookalike that goes out  matt i will say vex is not aware of this other vexs existence and has not encountered them 
none	  laura fine but when she does shell hire them  matt there you go  brian speaking of the de rolo family lipululu wants to know what are the names of percy and vexs kids  laura the pronunciation of the names are getting worse and worse  brian look its not going to be a good year for us folks what are the names of percy and vexs  kids unless you want to keep them private  laura its nugget  taliesin we named a couple of them  laura nugget north  brian nugget north isnt 
none	 that one of nolan norths kids names  laura no those are two names nugget north  liam nugget  laura yeah  liam im coming back from the dead to ask you why  laura salsa percival fredrickstein  brian rammstein  travis cheddar de rolo  sam capoeira  laura bacon thats a good one bacon  marisha bacon de rolo  taliesin and qwop  laura and then percival fredrickstein the fourth  matt when you guys decide those names you should put them on social media  taliesin i kind of like that they dont so 
none	 that if people want to actually play the kids in their  own games they can do what they want to do  laura i kind of want to name them though well name a few of them  matt you guys name your kids  taliesin we havent had time to sit down and go over this  liam its like george foreman they are all percy even the girls are all percy  laura percy percy percy percy percy  taliesin a couple of them wouldve gotten the other siblings names i think well go over it  
none	 brian sam jerrysalami wants to know  liam good name  brian sounds like the worlds lamest gangster hey its jerry salami hes going to put you in  the cement boots  liam jerry salamis coming for you  sam should i be worried  brian it was going to be andy dicks character on sopranos but he got cut did scanlan ever tell  kaylie that he let her win the flute competition  sam i didnt have to she knew thats my theory anyway because as i found out later in scanlans  life kaylie always knows 
none	 when he is lying so she knew and let him so she could get upstairs and try  to kill him  matt she knew yeah  sam yes she has this sense she can always tell when he is lying she can see through his charms  travis isnt that a great ability babe  laughter  brian terrible watch a marriage crumble  laura youre like the cat with the thing on its head  liam sings  brian taliesin bigcracker wants to know  liam whoa  brian look imagine a ritz cracker the size of this 
none	 card that i hold instead of perhaps a  middle aged  sam white guy  brian white guy who is probably very friendly he asks a great question when craven edge killed  grog how much guilt did percy feel knowing it was somewhat his fault for giving him the sword what  would he have done if pike couldnt bring him back  marisha yeah you’ve answered this  brian have you answered this  taliesin yeah i feel like i have but  sam youve never answered it in christoph waltz’ wardrobe  laughter  taliesin oh 
none	 wow thats a lot im just going to be sitting like this for the rest of the evening  no its weird one more  laughter  laura out of all the things that taliesin has worn this is the one you are getting the shit for  taliesin im so excited this is everything i’ve hoped for and more  liam thats bingo  taliesin it hardly matters how guilty he was he wasnt going to tell anybody he would have just  gone on the list of things i lived with it would be oh thats unfortunate but 
none	 it would be worse  if i actually got blamed for it so i am just going to keep my mouth shut why make things worse by  actually taking blame  liam my abs  marisha oh my god that was so good  brian sam ilikeporkandfighting wants to know did tary strike everything off his list  sam no shit i have it somewhere  brian tweet the list  sam i have a list i wrote down the things that i accomplished and the things that were left to be  done i also had a separate 
none	 list of all the things tary did with vox machina that he was going to  present to his dad possibly to prove that he was worthy but no he did not accomplish everything  on the list yet but there are many more adventures to be had for the two weeks before he  gets killed as a member of the darrington brigade  brian thats awesome taliesin and laura vohollica wants to know if percys first death had  not happened do you think that vex and percy would have spent their lives as really awkward neighbors  
none	 without ever realizing that they were pining for each other  laura we did talk about this too  brian god damn it it was so long ago and the mescaline and all the stuff  its just hard to remember  laura i think we said that they probably would have eventually come to it but it would have  taken a lot longer  taliesin and it would have been very awkward and strange  laura yeah for a while for a good long while  liam you once said to me behind the scenes if he doesnt 
none	 make a move its never going to happen  laura yeah  taliesin that may have just been because there was a lot of tension of when that was going to happen  laura and you did hear what she said  taliesin yeah i did so that was a thing  brian what she said  taliesin when i was unconscious  brian taliesin and laura yeah  brian unconscience marisha speaking of unconscience a question from you from our friend  tiamatzx how cathartic was it for keyleth to not submit to her vengeful desires and put raishan 
none	 in  her place by killing what made her who she was thus leaving behind a  feral shadow of her former self  marisha it was pretty gnarly  brian neat  marisha pretty gnarly  brian an answer worthy of a great question  marisha i fulfilled my promise right i guess i mean kerrek killed her  matt really you enabled the death though  taliesin he unplugged the machine you actually  marisha it was fitting as kind of my mentor yeah its good  liam that fact would have mentally tortured her far more than 
none	 the actual killing blow  laura isnt it so weird that so often the guests got the killing blow  matt that was crazy  sam mary especially  brian mary killed everyone  matt its frustrating from my end because i wanted to give some of these epic deaths to the mainstay  party but what are you going to do  laura i liked that the guests got them  matt it made a good feeling it does make for a cool memorable experience  laura yeah totally  matt but also its like the guest comes in 
none	 and is like hey guys cool thanks i win bye  sam who was your least favorite guest  brian thats a great question  matt will friedle  brian probably  matt im kidding i love you will youre amazing  brian i didnt care for  who was the fellow with the  matt danny glover  brian danny glover yeah ever since he got those dentures didnt understand anything he said no  offense to the denture people out there guys little bit of a situation here thats all the  questions that i have for the 
none	 cast i have several questions left for matt do you guys want to sit  here while i ask them to him or go out and eat that delicious food thats out there  travis peace out see you guys next week  liam well just keep saying taint thats fine  brian yeah just say taint for every answer of matts  matt please  brian no seriously you guys are more than welcome unless do you guys have any other  questions for each other or anything you want to ask matt that you didnt get a chance 
none	 to  marisha oh i have a question whats with the sphinxes and why didnt they live together  anymore so sad they were spouses and then they were separated  matt well when you live with somebody for a very long time eventually you enjoy the space you have  from each other  laura im going to throw something at you  matt well theyre creatures of purpose and they had purposes in different areas as was the  assignments of the knowing mistress they have the ability to communicate and every now and then  would probably

none	  a stay turnt my friends well be right back  all happy new year  matt good evening  brian thats all we had planned  matt mmhmm  brian were back your two dads in our robes here to answer questions  matt this is the best alternate universe my two dads  brian this is i know that was a great show  matt it was a show  brian was that a movie no that was a show  matt it was a show  brian i was thinking of three men and a little baby 
none	 starring tvs magnum  matt yes  brian matt i have some questions left over here that people are dying to know were going to burn  through these everyone else left because theres food and alcohol nearby so thats the way it works  vexmeupbeforeyougogo is back with a question  matt well played  brian might we learn more about vesh in the futore future futore do i drive a jaguar or  could you tell us about her a bit more her question mark a bit more youve said that  things as in who vesh is 
none	 et cetera werent quite as simple as kash thought  matt correct i mean ill go into it a little bit because who knows shes still an entity in  the world it might play into the next campaign i dont know theres a lot of questions where part  of me doesnt want to answer because i dont want to rob people of their own interpretations and  also because maybe things will show up in future campaigns i dont know with vesh in particular  vesh is an entity that presents itself as a god like anything powerful 
none	 would that wants to be  worshipped or given attention but isnt part of the pantheon as to whether or not she has  aspirations for it or is just trying to convince individuals of that to get what she wants you  know ill say that shes a powerful entity powerful enough to grant divine spells to her one  follower i will say that kash is not the first suitor that shes cycled through yeah ill leave  it there probably the most handsome not at all hes not handsome at all  kash has a very low 
none	 charisma  brian yeah cariboukai wants to know what were your original ideas for kynan did you have any  plans for him had vox machina accepted him into their fold in some way  matt kynan i had written to be their first fanboy as a party of adventurers begins to become  renowned and theyve had a parade set for them as thanks for helping uriel taldorei he was their  first interpretation of dealing with that attention and so my intent was for him to be that  lovable slightly annoying young upstart that wants to prove 
none	 himself and be friends with them  and wants to learn from them  brian oh like me with you guys  matt essentially yeah and we treated you basically the same way  brian yeah  matt so yeah the idea was for him to be this interesting obstacle on the way of renown  somebody that would want to tag along that theyd have to protect or leave behind or could  eventually be groomed into a hero if they chose to or in the circumstances that laid out give  such a harsh beat of reality in 
dung	 a way that someone as young and impressionable couldnt  emotionally process in a healthy way and it was so crushing to him at the time whether or not  that was the intent sent him on a very dark path and thankfully they were able to manage to pull  him from that i didnt expect any of his story to go that way when i was developing him  the whole interaction i didnt expect it to go that way  brian yeah well that happened a few times  matt a whole lot of times  brian 
none	 i dont know if i or someone else had asked you who your favorite i know its got to  be hard to pick one who your favorite npc as a person and maybe as to play is or maybe those  are different questions and thats okay  matt thats hard  brian im not asking you to choose but i am  matt theres different categories id put them in as far as villains go as much as i was  excited to play to jump into the role of my own interpretation of vecna whos this classic 
none	 dd  villain raishan and the briarwoods were both such living entities in my brain and for different  reasons i enjoyed jumping into those shoes its hard to pick  brian senokir was one that you liked right  matt senokir came out of nowhere he was completely spontaneous and he was a fun one just  because of the physicality and the creep factor and being able to just make the players feel  suddenly very uncomfortable  brian it was so uncomfortable  matt its great  brian oh my god and then the box  matt 
none	 oh yeah that was fun i have a special place in my heart for allura because allura  wasnt intended to be but in hindsight i can see was my selfinsertion npc if there was the one  where i felt was me trying to protect my friends and trying to be a guide in places i feel  theres a little part of me in each npc but in allura probably more than most her and gilmore  brian have you had that happen in other campaigns youve done where you find an npc or create one  that 
none	 sort of is an extension of yourself  matt a little bit but i havent had a campaign that ive been so emotionally invested before  its been a variety of different players ive had some players that were more into the roleplay  some players that were more into the mechanics and the combat i havent really had a game until this  group of fuckers where i can get so invested in the npc that i created if that makes sense its  still a very new level for me as a dm  brian well you wouldnt 
none	 be able to tell you hate it when i say shit like that im going to  keep doing that seedy88 wants to know could you share what happened to cassandra between the time  she took several arrows to the chest as she fled whitestone and the moment when percy found her  matt oh yeah okay cassandra was left to die in the snow and as she was bleeding out she was  recovered by some of the whitestone civilians a hunting squad that was out found her still alive  brought her back and nursed her partially 
none	 back to health knowing who she was but in the time that  she was recovering they were discovered by the briarwoods or the briarwoods lackeys and were  slaughtered and cassandra was recovered by them and nursed back to health after that she then got  to watch her whole family get hung the corpses anyway on the sun tree and was subjected to a lot  of brainwashing over a long period of time was forced to become a member of their family was  forced to eat dinner and breakfast with them every day they saw her 
none	 as an asset to keep the people  under control she was a connection to the old regime and they could kill her at any time but  she probably was more useful in the long run so they kept her around and she became this kind of  plaything this adopted child that they kept around for years and years she would try and  flee and escape and they would punish her for it and eventually got through a combination of  brainwashing and stockholm syndrome  brian oh where you actually fall in love with or begin 
none	 to  matt yeah and so they began to use her to weed out seeds of rebellion in the city and destroy  them internally they would send her out into the city to find those and be like i want to start  a rebellion who do i talk to theyd be like oh talk to this guy and shed be like okay  shed go and find out where the rebellions building in whitestone and return and tell them  where it was happening and they would wipe them out and they would quell any sort of uprising 
none	  using cassandra as an agent when vox machina arrived seeing her brother still alive and  seeing the possible fall of the briarwoods was just enough to break her from that and then there  was a recovery period a lot of her just trying to figure out who she was and dealing with the guilt  of the things that she did do even though she knew it wasnt her fault you cant get over that  right away thats something shes going to live with for a while but shes doing the best she can  to 
none	 make it right for people because of the things she did  brian but thats a lot of residual damage  matt oh yeah shes a very complicated npc that we didnt get to express too much but i didnt  feel it was necessary either her strength and inner stoicism i think said volumes of where she was  brian yeah and her mystery created a lot of intrigue as well  matt i hope so  brian it definitely did no it definitely did question that i have been thinking about what are  for you as youre 
none	 in these weeks and these months preparing for taking on a new campaign and  luckily getting to start at low levels and youre not dealing with a lot of the massive stuff that  youre dealing with at the end of a campaign but you are thinking about the end of that  campaign before it begins and how you map out and everything what are the truths of storytelling  that are the most important for you when youre thinking about something like this because  obviously you know you cant be married too much to an idea 
none	 and hold onto it in a place of  preciousness too tightly because youre with a group of people who can change that course at the  drop of a hat or at a bad roll or some things other things take a lot more time to mess up you  have to be malleable all the time in the storytelling so what are the pillars for you of  stuff where this is definitely something that i have to keep is that hard for you  matt i dont think its hard its hard when you start because when 
none	 you begin running games  your comfort your safety blanket if you will is the stuff that you have prepared thats what  makes you feel comfortable in the space the more you play the more you run games the more you  learn that does bring comfort but part of the joy is listening to the players seeing what they  do and change and actively alter what youve prepared and finding ways to incorporate that  into the things that you have already worked on and prepared for me the core idea is making sure  you have 
none	 a direction youre going but be open and willing to take the choices and the decisions  the players make and let that shift and alter what you have prepared and in many cases will surprise  you and end up developing something much more deep and interesting than what youre only one  person your input in a vacuum is probably pretty decent but the final product of having all these  friends come together and eventually build the narrative that leads to this points as long as  youre paying attention and youre open to taking these subconscious 
none	 suggestions theyre throwing  towards you as they develop the story itll end up being much more fleshedout and being much  more impactful for them and they themselves will sense the impact theyve had on the direction they traversed  with this characters you cant be too married to it you want to have a comfort of an idea where  youre going but constantly be listening and taking notes about the things the players do and  see how that would change the trajectory that youre planning and let it honestly in a lot of  cases a 
none	 big rule for me now is setting events and factions and a direction that will be happening  concurrently with the game as they progress whether or not they intersect with them in certain  times will gauge how they can influence the directions where those different factions or  storylines are going if they avoid them the whole game then itll definitely change whether  or not they end up encountering multiple times and plucking those threads earlier on for me thats  really exciting as a game master is to see what the players can alter at certain 
none	 times and  surprise you  brian so youre saying storytelling in this context is as much about listening and being open  you sitting down at the table every thursday with your heart open to where what they bring is going  to change the story and ultimately end up moving it forward  matt i dont solidly the plan more than one session ahead ill loosely plan arcs and maybe a  few sessions outlined and possibilities but session to session the players will make choices  thatll change what youve prepared now it is either being a 
none	 waste of time if you spent much  time preparing it in advance but you instinctively may be trying to railroad or push  them towards something that you had been hoping would happen three four sessions down the way and  sometimes that can work fine but for me its more thrilling to let the players really guide their  destiny a bit  brian can we get a fog machine on the dwarven forge this time i see people tweet some pretty  awesome pictures of their dwarven forge setups and they have dry ice and stuff like 
none	 that weve  got the budget with them firing me weve got some extra two three four five seven eight bucks  lying around  matt its more like a freetime thing i do what i can with the time i have  brian i know sometimes they get built during the break  matt yeah youll see me change pieces between based on the choices they make battlefields  that’ll never happen versus where theyre going and im like shit i have to rejangle this  brian its always funny because whatever pieces you leave behind ryan green puts 
none	 in his vest  matt its funny because sometimes they are eating and rehydrating and im a mad man in here going  like shit ugh  brian i know and by the time we have to come back matt is like i didn’t even get to pee i  was building what is hopefully going to kill all of them  matt well the new campaign will have a catheter so itll be much easier  brian yeah we got one put in the chair  matt im glad we got that approved by the way its a little 
none	 expensive right you know  brian sucks that i have to wipe it down every week cariboukai wants to know what were you  no just kidding we asked that farandaway15 you’ve mentioned that if scanlan didnt destroy  the gun that there was more planned for orthax how would that would have come into play if the  pepperbox have stayed around  matt well for one ripley would never have acquired orthax for herself ripley would have  been stalking the party for a long time to try and scrape what information she could off of percy  
none	 probably trying to find some way to steal some of his weaponry or even try to steal pepperbox while  it wasnt being tended to or they were sleeping orthax would have begun to push for the list for  completion and would begin to have a stronger influence on percival it would have been to the  point where certain scenarios where he would have moral decisions to let something live that  was either on the list or was impeding his progress to vengeance that he would have begun to resist the  will of orthax he may 
none	 have begun to exhibit more fiendish capabilities and being offered more  powers from orthax the more it began to consume him from the inside i didnt develop it too far  from that point but that was the direction i wanted to go with it based on how long it was  going to be around  brian wow do you plan on i dont want to say being harder on them now that theyre all gone  but this time around since they arent as much of a newbie as they were when they started before do  
none	 you plan on stepping things up a little bit or maybe challenging them more even though theyre  going to be obviously lower leveled theyre gonna be a little squishy you dont want throw  something crazy at them but now that they do with the exception of sam understand dd a lot  better are you going to be harder on them or maybe a little bit more  challenging this time around  matt i dont want to say harder on them because the point of the game is for everyone to have fun and  that doesnt 
none	 always mean making it harder but challenge them more id like to i think the  area where the new campaign is happening has a lot more social ramifications for the choices they make  brian also no doors in this campaign i thought that was a great choice this land has no doors  matt just archways which will be their new villain  brian hope they dont go into spanish villas then or hobbiton  matt to an extent yes i mean 5th edition dd was still new to me and them when we started  streaming this 
none	 so there was a learning curve through every level i was learning the balance and  everything and ive made mistakes here and there and i learned a lot going through the campaign  both on power levels and what makes an interesting encounter while also not making it so  hard to the point where it’s not fun weve had slogs and weve had battles that fall on that  category but once again thats part of the fun of playing this live is not everything is going to  be a perfect session were learning as you guys 
none	 watch it thats what i hope is part of it i  think so because its just us playing the game there’ll be those things ive learned a lot from  it the players have learned a lot i feel confident in their capabilities now of being a  little more tactical of learning that not every battle can be won some things are more about  creative use of the battlefield than just running and doing damage  brian theres a lot about gods  matt and learned a lot about preparation and learning what youre up against before 
none	 you jump into  that also and if not they’ll learn that very quickly i will say itll probably be a lot more  challenging also because as is the nature of dd once you get to the higher levels a lot of  things can be circumvented easier death becomes more of a nuisance to a certain extent the lower  levels are definitely not that case im both excited and very scared for the new campaign  we even ran our session zero with laura travis and marisha and in one attack lauras character  went to zero 
none	 hit points  brian she told me that  matt against a giant constrictor snake and i think that was a wakeupcall as it should have  been we’ll see how that plays out  brian dont show up with any weak shit  matt or at least just be mindful  brian nuclearwhale94 wants to know remember that one from the big nuclear whale of 94  matt yeah how could you forget  brian i remember where i was the morning raishan was in it for a purpose as we found out  can you elaborate on brimscythe 
none	 vorugal and umbrasyl  matt most of that  brian oh wait theres more can you elaborate on their motives and more of their characters as  we barely had any time with them  matt i’ll try and be concise brimscythe loved and had fascination with corrupting human political  structures so brimscythe had already as general krieg unrelated to the whole conclave incident  got himself ingrained in emons society and was basically just digging it out from the inside  thats why he had set a whole accommodation with a home there and a lair that was 
town	 not too far off  was out of just his own enjoying this degradation that he had created vorugal was an animal a very  powerful animal who was intelligent enough to get by but was more fascinated with the hunt was the  thrill of the stalking and fighting imagine vorugal very similar to akuma from street  fighter i guess you could say a warrior who is very powerful but has no goal other than to  eventually find something more powerful than him to give him a real challenge vorugal was very much a  similar mindset 
none	 to that i think umbrasyl had been hunted enough from lair to lair by people that  wanted to be rid of this black dragon scourge that had destroyed societies to the far west and  wanted an environment where he could rule without worry of being bothered or assaulted and  eventually hunted down  raishan and thordak although mostly raishan brokered this idea that if all of us  work together we can wipe out most of the controlling society on this continent and the  immediate threat of draconia which kept very close tabs on a number 
none	 of these members to just put us  in a position of power with no opposition and we can divvy up the land however we please and then  go about our business and help each other out when we need to chromatic dragons dont work well  together in a longterm deal so it was a short term like we all do this together then we all fuck  off to our four corners and we rule these four corners because we have wiped out opposition  that was the whole premise there for brimscythe if he had survived 
none	 he probably would have wanted  emon for himself but thordak honestly if brimscythe had survived when the conclave  happened thordak would probably have taken out brimscythe quietly without the rest of the  conclave knowing they never got there so i didnt elaborate too far on that one in the story but  there had been a conflict there between those two  brian that would have been cool  matt yeah i mean i can go on but there are other questions to get to  brian man that conclave arc was my favorite i think besides 
none	 the one where tary came in for a  little bit  matt its hard not to love tary  brian ledoomgov wants to know what were your plans had vox machina entered the hags house in  the shademirk bog  matt technically not a hag they thought it was i think i talked about this a little on one of the  talks machinas but this was another fey entity that was there that was a halfcorrupted  halfmonstrous and halfbeautiful woman if they had spoken to this woman and i cant remember  the name i have 
none	 it in my notes somewhere she could have given them information about saundor in  advance could basically have informed them with more history of his corruption what his quirks  were what he is seeking and would have given them possible knowledge that could have aided them in  the battle or to prevent a battle and there could have been a fully witsbased encounter with him  if they managed after talking with her convince him of his own folly and that he was not righteous  in the actions he had taken he may have felt so 
none	 guilty that he would have just withered away and  left the corruption to fade on its own without a conflict she was that but she was also an  oldschool ex of his from like a thousand years ago and they dont like each other anymore she was  excited to watch him fall but it never happened it was more of an interesting social encounter  that if they navigated well it could have lent more information with the coming conflict  brian i cant believe you remember all this stuff  matt i cant either laughter  
town	 brian myrennororunsha wants to know what exactly did jarett do that forced him to flee marquet  matt yeah that never came up in the campaign once again i have it in my notes jarett was not a  very welltodo individual in ankharel wasnt a street urchin by any means but was considered  probably very lower class and had through happenstance gotten involved with a very young girl who  was of a very high noble status in ankharel they began to pursue this romance in private because  from what her parents and family wanted was to 
none	 maintain a noble birthline and already had  suitors and im pretty sure had an arranged marriage prepared for her at a certain point and once  it was discovered that they had this tryst going on for a number of months he was going to be  executed he got the hell out of there so nothing illegal technically by the heart from the  family’s concern there he got out of there because he knew that if he made his way back there  it probably wouldnt end well it had been a while he probably could be 
none	 okay if he went back  and looked different enough but you know  brian its the same reason i fled nevada manlybubbles would like to know if the party  hadnt summoned the goristro to fight vorugal what would the adventure to find the spire of  conflux have looked like  matt oh shit that was a whole thing that never happened they would have to go to the  abyss they would have had to have gone to the maze of the abyss where the goristro hailed from  brian that would have been fun  matt 
none	 that would have been scary as shit because they would have had to not just navigate the  maze they would have had to navigate the maze to get to the specific goristro that contained the  spire which would have involved them finding some arcane means of tracking this entity or making  allies in the maze that could lead them in that direction let me tell you making allies with  demons always turns out well  brian yeah how do you think i got this job  matt laughs yeah it would have been complicated and very 
none	 dangerous so honestly that  was a very inspired use of the gate scroll when that item came up as a loot item i was thinking  it would be it was one of those systems for the dm and i recommend this for a dm sometimes  youll throw things in your campaign and youre like i dont know how or where theyll use this  but im sure it will be interesting whenever it does come up and it was their first real brush  with 9thlevel magic i was excited to see how they were going to 
none	 pull it out and that was  pretty inspired on their end  brian heck yeah one of those clutch things speaking of dr ripley from earlier  commanderclay wants to know what was dr ripleys plan and what was her deal with the devil  matt she wasnt a major player but she was part of a structure of military development in  rexontrum which is the capital city of west wynandir of the dwendalian empire  brian recsyndrome  matt rexontrum thatll show up in the new campaign she was on a medium scale a developer  of 
none	 military technology they were looking for ways to improve their dominance of that region  brian she was a justin hammer  matt kind of but a little more of a goebbels i guess you could say she was looking  into at the time more arcane diseases and things that could be a chemicalwarfare type  of basis that was technically illegal at the time and was using human experimentation unknown when  she was discovered she was about to be tried for it and so she fled but in part of that process she  probably figured out 
none	 that there was some bad blood between her and king bertrand dwendal which is  why he was on her list and a number of individuals on her list were people  brian yeah we had another question who were the people on ripleys list  matt i dont remember off the top of my head but all these people were all individuals she worked  with that were responsible for turning her in to the crown and getting her placed on a list for  trial she had some smalllevel magic as a lot of the higherlevel members of 
none	 rexontrum and that  area do and utilized what she had to escape and fled out of the kingdom over to the menagerie  coast at port damali and thats where she met the other fugitives the briarwoods they had this  unification of ideals and decided their purpose was to lets work together and see where this can  take us so that was that and as far as her plans with orthax it was just her now fascinated  with this new technology that she saw a lot of uses and as this was the source of it 
none	 it seemed  what secrets did it not tell percy yet what was it holding back and if she embraced this entity  what more could she learn from it that percival would never his moral code allow him  to make the sacrifice for she was driven a little mad by that pursuit at that time  brian one of the best npcpc emotional tugofwars sinister  matt oh man i loved it i was sad that she died in that battle i knew it was probably going to  happen but i was hoping she would be a 
none	 fun one to string along for a while and just  be a recurring villain  brian maybe there will be a version of her in the next campaign  matt she almost got away  brian yeah just like ash hakumen narukami wants to know what would have happened if vex couldnt  find the grey render or if it had escaped anything would have happened there  matt technically it escaped  brian ran away right  matt she wasnt able to necessarily charm it to her and if she had been able to succeed to  convince 
none	 it the grey render would have bound itself to her grey renders do that sometimes  they will pick an entity or a location they bind themselves to and will protect it at all costs so the  grey render would have become a force of nature that whenever she was in the area of whitestone  would protect vex from the shadows and then continue to protect her bloodline so any  children she would have had it would become the protector of the family she didnt succeed at  that so instead it just continues to wander the 
none	 parchwood around whitestone watching over its  young so she did miss that opportunity but thats fine it happens in dd not everything is  a success yeah thats kind of it  brian interesting speaking of the last fireside chat that you did brooke casey says when the  assassin created from the fireside chat was made into a baker was it pure serendipity that vox  machina in the downtime had founded the slayers cake or had you influenced that at all if they  hadnt how would she have been added  matt no that was completely 
none	 by a serendipitous scenario they hadnt even told me their intention  over the break to develop this the slayers cake at the time it was the whole chat trying to be  ridiculous and trying to get me to create an npc called troy baker thats where it came from  brian named after the video game voice actor troy baker  matt no named after the  brian oh the guy from deadliest catch  matt yeah exactly  brian the game about football deadliest catch  matt yeah that one  brian yeah its like death race 
none	 except they play football  matt i would watch so much more football or any laughs it was purely a chatbased joke on trying  to get me to name an npc troy baker i was like all right its a baker fine its a baker i  give you that and then when they did the slayers cake because i was trying to think how  the assassin was going to ingrain themselves into the story and that was the perfect in and im  like well thank you for solving a problem i hadnt come up with an 
none	 answer for yet fuck yeah  brian okay last few here weve got for you repete17 was there a way to avoid the fight with the  gigantic forge guardian at the core anvil  matt oh right there would have been if they had brought any materials to craft or create something  using the anvil  brian that was the trick  matt as part of the worship to the allhammer that this location maintained since the allhammer  no longer exists on this plane it would be to create and craft something on the anvil and leave 
none	  it as an offering to the forge guardian and the allhammers memory so if they had brought  anything whether it had been any of the raw ore that they had found in previous rooms and crafted  something that was deemed a worthy gift then they wouldnt have had to worry about the actual  encounter with the forge guardian but once again dd  brian yeah exactly tcoblivion is devossas cover story permanently blown now  matt devossas cover story with the people of ankharel no devossas cover extends to the  general populace but to mainstream 
none	 leaders in other parts of the world that have had to work  directly with jmon sa ord and their presence in recent events i dont think has blown any of the  cover there and theyre all very well aware of jmons necessity to keep such things under wraps  im sure rumors will spread but rumors have always spread and whenever a rumor has gotten  close to jmons existence theyve been very conscious to disseminate other rumors that would  just clutter and cloud that same space almost like our current political structure im not too  
none	 terribly worried about it for hundreds of years there have been theories that jmon is a dragon  but there have also been theories that jmon is a number of people that just pass through like an  office like the dread pirate roberts or that its an alien entity from another plane that lives  forever theres been a lot of rumors  brian or the saint the popular val kilmer film  matt its the film its an actual boxed dvd as the leader of ankharel  brian dani just started typing up her letter of resignation after 
none	 that joke  matt good job  brian was dr dranzel just looking to make a score or as a leader of the golden grin did he  have other motive for sending vox machina back to general kriegs house this question’s also from  mumbled  matt that was purely out of need for money dr dranzel is not a leader of the golden grin just a  member and its a very wellhidden fact on his end only those who keenly paid attention to the  campaign guide would have noticed that  brian few im sure knowing 
none	 this community  matt im sure many dr dranzel is all about as is the golden grin uplifting the underdog and  protectors of good in society and dranzel does so whenever the opportunity arises hes kind of a  passive member more active in his youth but that whole element was just basically going hey so  we need some cash and i hear theres some things that are pretty pricey that no ones watching  over want to go get some  brian how much do if at all real events impact any of the storytelling that you 
none	 do i think  about how david milch talks about how george hearst in the third season of deadwood is to  represent capitalism coming to america 1876 right the forerunner for capitalism would be a  serial killer in the form of garret dillahunts character so thinking about the campaign do you  find that what happens in the world whether it be the injustices or our successes in any current  shape find its way into the story is it hard to ignore whats going on in the real world  because so many of us look at 
none	 this game as a way to sometimes escape you know im not a big  escapism person but for four hours to just go like this will bring me to a place of happiness  matt its an interesting point i would say i dont tailor my stories to reflect the world but id  imagine subconsciously its hard to avoid it too  brian its hard to not be impacted by it  matt the world is filled with so much variety of conflict that no matter what you create in the story  that has conflict theres going 
none	 to be parallels whatever is close to you is going to lead its way  in some way shape or form into the work that youre doing its not just writing or writing  especially a lot things that you do they just find their way in i think in hindsight there were  elements in the campaign that im sure were you know things bleeding over this upcoming campaign  just in the way ive built the world im sure theres been a lot thats bled into it as well  therell be parallels and you want to tell 
none	 stories for some people its escapism for other  people i think its a therapeutic way of dealing with the injustices of the world im not trying  to show an example of a perfect world im not trying to be like the world sucks out there so  come to our place where everythings great im like the world there sucks come to this world  where some things do suck but people are standing up and making a difference people are trying to  actively make the sacrifices that are necessary and stand up and be heroes in 
none	 the face of  injustice and probable loss because somebody needs to and thats the tale i want to tell i dont  want to inspire people to ignore the darkness and find a safe space there is an  element of that but i think in that space you can also teach people the importance of standing up  for whats fucked up in the world around you and in what small way you can contribute to changing  the things youre unhappy with i think weve seen a lot of that in the community weve seen a lot 
none	  of that in storytelling in recent years in general the good stories come from people that  are frustrated with the world and want to make a difference and the only way they can is with a pen  and pencil  brian thats true thats a great sentiment whats the hardest thing for you to write  matt oh man thats an interesting question  brian are you struggling with anything right now that youre just like its not coming together  matt strangely no its coming together but its been a lot of months of percolating ideas 
none	 and  throwing things down  brian youve had some practice  matt i think the hardest thing for me is outlining enough faction perspectives to flesh out  a world but not have everyone feel like theyre constantly at war if that makes sense we have  all these various societies and factions that all have conflicting ideals and interests however  theyre not always battling for me its a conscious development choice to find ways in which  they have to coexist or find ways in which they have to agree not to  brian a trade deal 
none	 or a thing yeah  matt right you know with a long term idea of how to do i take you in the end or the  mutual destruction type idea of like you know well if we both do go to war we both will probably  kill each other lets best just hold this tension for now well table this at the moment and come  back to it later history is a great source of these stories you look at the history of  humanity if you ever want to run a game and you want to 
none	 get something a little more interesting  and political read history i know it may have sucked when you were in high school but i  guarantee the older you get the more interesting history is and there is some fascinating history  in human civilization around the world  brian or just watch a bunch of eddie izzard specials  matt that too honestly yes so yeah thats about as elaborate as i can get on the topic before  rambling and boring you all  brian yeah i get it im just sneaking in a few of my 
none	 own questions here because im selfish did  you have alternative plans for craven edge if percy hadnt picked it up and given it to grog  matt no it was just going to be a weapon that was left behind and would have probably gone into  some archive somewhere i expected it may have been found but also as youve seen in a lot of  battles sometimes in the throes of a very emotional sequence loot will be forgotten or i  expected somebody to pick it up somebody who wasnt percy and be like this doesnt 
none	 look good  let me go ahead and find somebody who can identify it and be like oh this is bad and be like  fuck this and throw it away that was the more probable thing but much like grog finding the  deck of many things sometimes the people you dont expect are the first to find the loot  brian that changed the game  matt i was like if anybody finds the deck except for grog theyll probably be okay  brian uhoh i know yeah and it being travis too vincek42 says so the party 
none	 was about one  rolldecision away from never discovering tyriok the mapmaker in his petrified form  matt oh right  brian how many dead or permanently incapacitated npcs who vox machina just missed are there  matt laughs  brian that happen a lot  matt not a lot because not  brian am i showing nipple are we okay  matt oh dont cover up  brian okay well were going to get banned on twitch they told me as much sorry  matt i mean recurring npcs not many because either they stay in places that are 
none	 safe or they  encountered them gilmore during the chroma fall when the conclave attacked emon tyriok their  friends when they were going up entropis at the end if they had not managed to protect or deflect  vorugals flyover of whitestone when they had put up the illusionary barrier and his return from  draconia there couldve been some bad stuff there because he wouldn’t have attacked then he  wouldve flown up or pretended it wasnt there and then come back later on with probably two other members  of the conclave and wiped out a lot 
none	 of whitestone and that wouldve been bad  brian yeah  matt its not too often because i dont want them to continuously meet npcs theyve already met  theres probably npcs they never met that probably died offscreen that they never encountered  brian or ones that got killed within one line of dialogue  matt or there was that yeah  brian that was hilarious gavrock wants to know how are shale and the herd of storms doing  following the fall of umbrasyl  matt the herd of storms which technically is no longer called the herd 
none	 of storms at this point  although the stigma around the title is a bit rough theyre doing all right theyre  rebuilding theyre taking a little more of a peaceful trade and interacting with local society  for goods and then staying to nature a less dominant kevdakstyle of conquer take and ruin  shale is not around anymore shale according to chris perkins and im not going to rob him of his  characters end probably fell down the mountain shortly after that battle and died alone somewhere  in the cliffkeep by his own words but shale 
none	 had done well and she had lived a good life up to  that point and contributed  brian thats crazy  matt go shale  brian go shale i know youre watching chris  matt drink to shale  brian i know youre watching christopher metallicagross wants to know chris you agree  with that  chris im a megadeth fan  brian oh hes a megadeth fan i like megadeth matt was there any exciting backstory  sidequests lore or loot tied to that ship in vorugals lair was that anything  matt the party put a lot 
none	 more to that boat than there was  brian okay so it was one of those things like senokirs box where it was like obsessed with it  but it was okay  matt yeah vorugal who had just relocated to make the ruins of draconia their nest then began  to amass what goods were nearby and so began to do flyovers of nearby villages and civilizations  and grab whatever was there kill whoever was present and take it back and began to build a  new hoard and one of the things happened to be a ship 
none	 that was out in the ocean that vorugal  destroyed partially and then took the rest of it back and then began to sift through what was  inside and over time began to freeze over there was nothing too special in there i would have  rolled up some random magical items for it i did have some random items rolled up for it but  nothing too crazy but thats also one of the things i love about being a dm is you can  convince the party unintentionally of all the possible intents storybased mystery about a 
none	  scenario that literally is just a broken ship  brian yeah thats kind of what happened on lost too  matt yeah  brian you know what im talking about sigh that ship at least they killed the guy in there  hey ellie a oneil wants to know what were the specific triggers for the vestiges awakening did  we talk about that already and were there any awakenings we didnt get to see  matt i largely prefer and i put this in the campaign guide a little bit for those who want to  use it 
none	 i prefer the vestiges awakening at moments of either heavy character development  advancement or a crux for their flaws or bonds if you run those systems or something that is so  out of character and them embracing a level of adventurous heroism they wouldnt otherwise  essentially whenever you as the gm or the director of the game goes oh man this would be a  fucking cool moment for this to awaken you know when the player surprises you with something  youre like well thats enough for this thing to start glowing and get more awesome 
none	 you know i  wanted to leave it kind of vague because to me its up to you to find those moments all of the  vestiges im pretty sure exalted in the campaign but not everything they found was  dormant when they found it and this because i didnt want people at higher levels getting  towards the end of the campaign comparably to have to get a dormant item and be like oh i have to  awaken it and then i have to exalt it necessarily i wanted it to be at certain levels so i 
none	 built in  a system where if a vestige is unattuned or unused for a long time it slowly reverts back to its  dormant state some of them may have been already awakened when they found them but hadnt been  exalted yet and hadnt quite fully regressed yet so that was my way of dealing with that scenario  brian yeah so youre saying for people who want to do it in their own campaign sort of  casebycase it because if you pick it out yourself you maybe rob yourself of a moment where  the player 
none	 does something that makes you go oh thats it  matt yeah i mean you could do it you could be like when they kill their 20th creature or when  they use this feature x number of times those are totally viable ways to do it i think i have a  suggestion of that in the campaign guide but for me its more fun to wait for those heroic moments  when a player surprises you and their party members and does something really cool really in  or out of character or really elevates the narrative in 
none	 a way you arent expecting and youre  like this is the moment where i reward you for that awesome moment with your vestige reaching the  next stage  brian yeah wow okay pretty cool thefoxykarama wants to know would it have been possible for  vex to call upon the help of galdric galdric right  matt yeah  brian of galdric while performing the trial to become mistress of the grey hunt  matt yeah totally  brian okay  matt yeah that was totally an option galdric is one of the the since being assigned by 
none	 vax now  is this perpetual guardian up until the end of his life of the surrounding whitestone scenario and  has been through years of being kept inside the necklace and through blessings of the raven queen  probably has a much more prolonged life than a regular wolf would so galdric will be around for  quite a while to keep watch on the woods and if vex decided to go call upon him then yeah totally  brian wow okay good to know if this character doesnt work out she can go start her own thing  
none	 with vex  matt laughter exactly there you go perfect  brian forsakengrundle come on  matt still one of the best  brian just right below my beloved arsequeef what happened to the new  lord of the quadroads crossroads  matt oh the one who was given the wishes by grog well like most people that suddenly come  into a lot of money spent a lot of it hes well established hes living fine he didnt have a  lot of aspirations with his wish spells other than more money nice house hes probably still  holding 
none	 onto his last wish probably yeah so with the influx of money hes not super high  level you couldnt wish for an exorbitant amount of money to the point where hes the richest  person in vasselheim but he went from squalor to a very comfortable mid to high level nobility and  title and everything with the wish hes doing all right but i think hes also tortured of what his  final wish is going to be and probably will never use it probably live the rest of his life unsure  of what it should and 
none	 then will probably die not knowing what it is  brian wow thats crazy last question  matt oh shit  brian minafae wants to know what is the relationship history between jmon and gilmore  they were having a pretty indepth conversation after that thordak fight  matt theres no history between the two they hadnt met before that i think it was more  gilmore realizing the opportunity to talk to what is one of the most mysterious prestigious figures  of his entire upbringing and culture it was this opportunity for gilmore to be like oh mr 
none	  president let me shake your hand and ive always wondered what are your thoughts on this and what  are your thoughts on that i think it was less jmon being interested in gilmore although happy  to answer any questions that he has i think it was gilmore more being interested in what they  were and what they had to say and just taking this one opportunity to shake hands with this majestic  entity that would probably never happen again so that was that there wasnt a long history it was  more gilmore being like 
none	 while youre here can i take a selfie that kind of feel  brian yeah thats what our friend chris did when he saw maynard from tool at lax  matt dont blame me i will say on that part theres been a lot of questions about it gilmore  is fine gilmore is happy gilmore has through the years developed his business on a scale that  isnt too fast and too expansive has found love lost love found love again gilmore is happy so  take that with you  brian thats good to know has he ever 
dung	 gone into a full beautiful delicious beard i know mine was  trimmed recently  matt later in life maybe but i think gilmore loves the fabulous jawline too much  brian yeah he wants to show off the jawline as we wind down here and weve been thinking and  talking as much as we can or as much as we want to about the new campaign i want to say as a  critter and as a fan of the show i think that theres a lot of speculation on the internet  theres a lot of the 
none	 discussion thread on reddit about the new campaign is at some astronomical  number of comments and theory and everything expectations being whatever they are theyre  going to range across the community if you were to do a survey which i dont recommend i want to  say on behalf of anyone who feels this way that my only expectation going into this and i hope  this in some way relieves any of that pressure my expectations going into the next campaign is  thursday night im going to turn on twitch im gonna be two drinks in 
none	 already but im gonna turn  on twitch at 700 and i hope to just see a bunch nerdy ass voice actors playing dd  matt thats the best i could hope for  brian yeah and i just think like i know theres a lot of pressure i know there must be with the  success of the show especially after talks machina came along before i mean it was dead in the  water lets admit  matt thank you for that for elevating us  brian yeah right but i just want to say as a writer 
none	 and as a friend the foundations upon what  makes this show not only successful and people watch it but people watch it not because its  entertaining only because they are a part of it in many ways and that creates a lot of healthy  things and it creates a lot of unhealthy expectations i just want you guys to feel like  ive talked to so many critters and so many people everybodys excited to see you back much  less in a new campaign and new characters and all that stuff and a new story line 
none	 i just want to  set the precedent that the expectations for those of us who really know and love the show is just  more nerdy ass voice actors playing dd whatever that ends up looking like if somebody dies in  week two just have fun and keep doing whats made it great  matt thank you im hoping that i will say these past two and a half three months or so where  weve been off the story even with the oneshots its been really hard ive really missed getting  back to the table every 
none	 week and playing a consistent story with my friends so im really  excited to get back to that but also for everyone who came through the story of vox machina  with us that many years of character exploration and relationship development lead to where we  ended that campaign do not expect the new campaign to start with that level of relationship  development and investment i mean anyone whos played dd its gonna be a weird ride for the  first beginning as everyones figuring out their characters figuring out each others characters  figuring out the 
none	 story and the world around them  brian accents  matt that too oh man its going to be fun so all i ask is come to have fun come to watch us have  fun fumble around and figure out where this is going and i hope you have a good time  brian clear eyes clear heads whats the anybody watch friday night lights  offscreen clear eyes full hearts can’t lose  brian thank you chiffre was that le chiffre come over here you guys before we go i have to  say one year ago today
