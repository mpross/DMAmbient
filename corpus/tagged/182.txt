making sure  that syrinscape 1 sounds awesome and 2 that matts hair is appropriately coiffed designed  and styled because if theres one thing that you cant have its an unattractivelooking matt on  camera  taliesin they have to dope it first so it sleeps through the game  ivan /none/ they have to make sure they inject it with a localized anesthetic so that it behaves  taliesin well it is carnivorous and it can bite if you havent had it properly doped down its  used to doing two shows a day so its pretty solid  ivan its fair normally its usually wellfed right before a show  taliesin you cant get it wet and you cant feed it after midnight  ivan it spawns little tiny matts hair yeah he heard me  taliesin speaking of things that should be an icon in the chat room  /none/ ivan oh
