none	 matt anything else cool were good all right lets dive into tonights episode proper so last  we left off the party vox machina having recently suffered their main city of emon and one  of their initial towns where they began their adventures in westruun under attack from an entity  called the chroma conclave a collection of allied chromatic dragons extremely powerful ancient  across the board it seems is wreaking havoc across all of taldorei they managed to save a  few allies make a few current tenuous relationships with the clasp and moved all of the 
town	  refugees that they had been keeping within greyskull keep to whitestone to keep them safe for  the time being as that town had seemingly been passed over by the dragons that are still heading  east across the continent after that the party made their way to vasselheim vasselheim the  distant city known as the cradle of faith the oldest living beacon of civilization in the world  that is currently known after making their way there the party made their way into the guild of  the slayers take where they had previously signed on after 
none	 a trial and are members of to  seek more allies throughout the city of vasselheim in hopes of preparing themselves to retake emon  possibly taldorei at some point in the near future that is where we left off as you guys  have spent some time resting within the actual weve got whispers going around over here already and we  havent started  marisha do you want to say  sam no  marisha no thank you keep going  matt okay two can play at that game so as you guys take a little bit of 
none	 time getting  reacquainted with the guild hall of the slayers take setting your stuff down that you need to prepare  for a short period of time staying in the city or longer if need be you ran briefly into mertin  cyndrial the husband of vanessa whos the huntmaster of the entire guild and had a brief  conversation with aldor who was beating thorbir at cards  laura what a dick  liam love that guy  matt hes a nice fella  laura not thorbir hes great  matt there you go not very good with 
none	 dice so that being the case what would you guys like to  do at this point in time  laura i dont know im just asking you guys  marisha so we slept and we woke up  matt you just arrived now its middayish at this point early morning to midday  liam yeah we slept at the slayers take we talked to aldor for a minute right  matt you havent slept youve arrived its like morning midday now youve just situated  yourselves in the guild you had an evenings rest before you came here but 
town	 you have used your  7thlevel spell to get here  marisha yes right yeah yeah yeah  matt so what is the plan  liam is there one  taliesin im at this point prepared for some decompression of some kind no one can be expected  to move at the speeds weve been moving at for the past week perhaps grab an earlymorning drink and  find out how much news has actually reached this town about whats happening out in the world right  now  liam thats a good idea percy  laura we need to 
none	 find lady kima  taliesin thats actually an even better idea  sam thats a fantastic idea  taliesin perhaps she will go to breakfast  laura shes at the temple of bahamut  liam yes  taliesin that sounds right  sam percy  taliesin yes  sam can i just remind you for no other reasons than to be helpful to you in the game and no other  reason that the black powder salesman lives here just throwing it out there you might need some  supplies  taliesin its interesting because i sleep at night and 
none	 these voices from nowhere consistently  remind me that theres a black powder merchant in this  liam what game are you talking about we dont have time for games there are dragons that need  dealing with  sam youre right how silly of me  liam stick to music please we dont need games  taliesin kima i think is an excellent idea  sam kima is a great idea  matt last i heard victor was blown apart  laura we also need oh  matt you dont know  laura we also need supplies  sam 
none	 oh yes hell yes i dont have anything  laura we need lots of potions health potions  sam yeah but they sell those here  laura they sell health potions here yeah  matt youve purchased them in the past  laura yeah they sell them here  matt remember thats where grog had his fantastic bartering skills last time to acquire a  few potions  travis yeah im an investment banker  laura thats right oh that merchant might be here still we have so many things to catch up  on  marisha we can also 
none	 talk to the slayers take as well  laura were just waiting for vanessa and zahra to get back from their hunt am i right  matt yeah  sam who oh the wife  liam yeah merkels wife  marisha i didnt meet zahra  laura no you didnt  travis shes got a tail  laura shes quite wonderful  sam shes very powerful  laura shes actually related to well percy you would know  sam shes related to percy i dont see the resemblance  taliesin no shes related to lillith they actually are they are 
none	 related that is true our  friend from previously  laura yes our friend from previously  taliesin with that lets find kima perhaps that would be the best course of action  matt so you guys are going to head towards the  liam do you think kima wants to go potionshopping maybe we should go get some shit  and then see kima i think kima would be a little impatient  taliesin that may actually be a good point  laura all right all right all right all right lets go really fast theres dragons in the 
none	  world we dont have time to shop  travis can you slam down an hourglass for shopping  liam sister dear how much coin do we have at the moment  laura well not a ton  liam how many poptarts do we have  laura we have a lot of poptarts but not very many gold pieces  liam in the party if anyones holding coin because i dont have much at all i dont need  much but we do need healing potions  laura i have enough in the party funds to buy some healing potions 
dung	 so i think  taliesin is that including what we got from my sister  laura yes it is  taliesin lets buy some potions  liam youre in charge lets go  matt all right as you guys heads towards the front door of the slayers take guild hall youre  but feet from it before the door slams open as the cold winter wind comes pouring in  taliesin oh thats right  matt there standing in the doorway you see the outer frame of a strong female form dark  brownishblack leathers you can see tousled dark 
none	 hair piercing pupilless eyes and there stands  huntmaster vanessa clutching a bag thats seemingly dampened at its base in her right hand  as she steps into the main foyer looking about all of you gathered in the front area well  isnt this a nice surprise in the middle of the morning ah  laura welcome back  matt a pleasure to see you all ah hold on the rest of you inside where its warmer and as  she steps inside you see two individuals step out of the shadows behind her one of which is another 
none	  tiefling female white hair red in skin and another individual familiar to some of you  human short brown shoulderlength hair series of scars across his arm carrying a shield and spear  as kashaw and zahra come in to accompany  travis get your ass in here  mary look what the bear brought in hello darling  sam where do i go  will im going to sneak through  mary hello have you gotten bigger  travis yeah ive been lifting lots of horses and mules and stuff  mary oh my goodness hello darling

none	  marisha lackeys  laura he doesnt realize that you bet against him  liam i would not bring good to see you again i wouldnt bring that up  will it was a wonderful fight did you see it  travis it was did you see me powerbomb him at the end  mary hello percy  taliesin lovely to see you again its been a complicated month well get into it  mary how are the weapons holding up  taliesin quite well hmm liquefied but mostly functioning  hello i dont think weve met percy fredrickstein von 
none	 musel klossowski de rolo iii  and you are  will whwhat confused can you say that again  taliesin just call me percy  will okay kashaw vesh  sam scanlan shorthalt  will how are you  sam its nice to meet you ive heard many a tale of your wit and bravery  taliesin that kashaw oh yes that one yes of course  laura weve heard so many things about you kash  will hopefully all good thank you  travis laughs then coughs  will is he choking  travis im good  marisha and 
none	 you must be zahra  mary i am and you are keyleth is that right  marisha thats right yeah yeah  mary you are beautiful arent you  marisha stutters  mary sorry  sam i told her i told her  mary yes  matt at which point vanessa groans staring at this display  sam oh sorry  laura sorry  matt i hope this has worked out well for all of you i however have a bit of business of ours to  finish okay  mary yes we do  liam hey whats in that 
none	 bag  travis yeah whatd you catch  matt she walks up to the table where mertins standing he reaches out to greet her with arms  extended she throws it into his arms he catches it pulls it open you see within there is a head  of what looks like a humanoid head but the skin is greyish and featureless the eyes are whitish  and milky what hair is there in wisps is white in color who here is trained in arcana  mary i think i am  sam i am  matt you know what 
none	 this is  mary i already know  matt roll an arcana check  laura why dont we ask you then  sam 21  matt 21 this is the head of a doppelganger this is a creature that spends a lot of its time  infiltrating society being able to take the form and shape of other individuals to assume their  position to take their wealth to do all sorts of sometimes interesting or dastardly things  will made him a bitch to find  mary yeah  sam its a shapeshifter  matt yep  sam what 
none	 can you do with the head  matt well turn it in for the money its worth spread the change and forget about it  taliesin how do you know when you have one  sam thats true  travis and what was it posing as  taliesin and at that point dont you just already have one at that point  matt well this is for me to worry about not for you to care  laura vanessa i have a question  matt yes please  laura do you ever hunt creatures just because theyre evil and theyre 
none	 killing people  matt generally somebody will eventually be paying for such a creature to be hunted so i do  not feel the necessity to do it without  laura what if lots of people are dying and you might be at risk as well  matt then i think it should be very easy to convince someone to pay for it  laura okay  marisha what if the cost is the end of the world  matt well i imagine that would be quite a terrible thing  marisha sure thats what were looking at here  
none	 mary really  laura okay so vasselheim is unaware of whats going on but a lot of cities have been  destroyed  will cities multiple cities have been destroyed  laura multiple cities emon was the first one hit  will its gone  laura well its still there technically just crumbled  taliesin and flat  marisha and under rule by an ancient red dragon  mary so much has changed since lillith was there  laura so much  mary how did this happen  laura he escaped hed been trapped in the fire plane and  
none	 taliesin were not entirely sure what happened but he escaped the fire plane and somehow created  a coalition of chromatic dragons and they are ravaging the countryside  laura yes which is very strange  mary what color  will how many  laura red white green black blue was one of them at a time  marisha they call themselves the chroma conclave  travis eight total  mary the chroma concl there were eight  laura theres four of them theres four of them  marisha no youre you dont double them by city its just one 
none	 city no never mind just  one dragon  travis one three five eight  matt vanessas crossed her arms and thinks for a second and she goes ah if what you say is true  this is very unfortunate and a bit larger than what our simple guild could even hope to really  help this would be something to take to the various temples  laura yes and we plan on it but we know that the slayers take is full of very strong very  qualified fighters and we were hoping to have you at our side 
none	 as well  matt well let me put it this way if what you say is true multiple incredibly powerful ancient  dragons roaming destroying this is not something you can throw yourself at until  eventually one or the other falls you have to find a weakness you have to find the way to be on  their level ask around see what other allies you can find  liam yes  laura a metallic dragon  taliesin temple of bahamut  liam what you say is correct these are the first moments after us finding out this is 
none	 a first  step but being members here and seeing what your people can do no audio i know this is just a  first step and were about to enter vasselheim proper but  marisha it should speak pretty loudly that we came to you first thats how much we trust you  liam can we count on you  matt sighs i am huntmaster of the slayers take i deal in contracts i deal in business i  deal in the hunting of relatively unorganized creatures this this is beyond me that is not  to say i 
none	 would not be willing to help but there are many things to consider first perhaps you  should speak with osysa  sam what who  matt osysa  sam osysa  liam the sphinx  matt our patron of ioun  laura okay  matt she would have a better mind for this than me this is  laura how do we talk to her  matt the same way you did last time  laura yes  matt follow me  mary before we go i believe we have a little settlingup to do  will im cold 
none	 and i still havent been paid  matt my apologies mertin  hes over there hes currently putting the head into a small case and closing up and he goes  aye not to worry ill be more than happy to get this for you and he leaves for a second comes  back goes through the contract reads a couple things pulls out a large chest and begins  divvying up coin and throws a satchel to each of you that contains for both of you divided for  this contract that would come to 2250 gold pieces  
town	 mary pleasure as always  sam they have more than we do  laura no they dont  mary thank you very much  matt of course thats what im here for  mary it was an interesting challenge thank you we had a rather good time with that one  will interesting trying to track it down thats for damn sure  travis what was it hiding as by the way  mary a plethora of different entities and beings it was running around town changing at will  laura isnt that like that rakshasa you were talking about 
none	  marisha it seems familiar actually  will does sound familiar that was interesting and bloody  marisha yup  matt regardless shall we very well and she begins walking further to the back of the guild  hall where you come to the same doorway that you previously entered with her before the chains in  the side that sets up a large slab that leads to a staircase that leads to the subterranean area  right beneath the slayers take you may have noticed it previously but there is a structure  above where the subterranean area is 
dung	 behind the slayers take and its it looks like a very  simple temple you havent really gone into it but as you step down into this dark area  underneath you can see the sconces lighting along with you as you step into this dark cavern as it  opens up once again you can see the remnants of this hidden temple to ioun the goddess of  knowledge and whats curious about this temple is ioun is a goddess of knowledge and openness one  of her main astute pushes is the fact that knowledge is to be 
none	 shared and spread so its  curious to see that something of hers is hidden theres probably a purpose to that pushing up the  steps again vanessa puts her hand up and tells you all to stop and calls out again osysa i  apologize to bother you but we have a predicament that i believe requires your attention  as a moment passes where once again you hear the low rumbling growl in the shadows growls you  hear slams of giant footfalls across stone as what little bit of light torches begin to spark to life  
none	 around the top of this platform this stone platform and at the very top of this staircase  that leads to the top of where this platform ends you can see standing above it a very large female  sphinx with a lion body a female head adorned with golden jewels around the neck eyes that are  light sky blue and white in color proud as these giant griffinlike wings stretch out and the  entity comes to rest at the top paws folded over the edge yes i recall so what do you need of me  laura 
none	 well  travis yeah go for it vex  laura your help potentially the world is under attack  matt the head sinks for a moment i have been watching by the heartstone naught but this past  day i have been keeping tabs in hopes that such a cataclysm would not find its way to my mate it  has not so being aware of this what do you ask  laura is there anything that you know of that could help us defeat these ancient beings  matt she thinks for a second steps up and closes her 
none	 eyes as her muscles tense her eyes open  again that color flashing with this luminescent blue color and her voice falls even deeper into  her register and almost has this monotone informative projection that says the vestiges of  divergence relics wielded when the gods walked and fought alongside their creations the light  fades from the eyes for a second she catches herself and steps back  mary may i ask what are the vestiges of divergence  matt she shakes her head i am a channel for this knowledge but the best i can understand  
dung	 they are old relics of the war of the divergence leading into the penance the second spark these  were armaments objects of great power that were used in these wars against the gods good and  dark many have been buried entombed lost forgotten the few that are recovered are passed  on through blood lines through symbols of power and of seats of great political importance but  the actual information is lost to me  laura do you know of any one in particular  matt she concentrates for a second not within my field of vision 
none	 objects of this powerful  enchantment are also prone to want to keep themselves hidden  laura thats convenient  marisha osysa if you are aware of this knowledge then you know that vasselheim is one of  the only remaining cities still left standing are there any other services you can offer to help us  fight this  matt the danger that you run here is that vasselheim has stood the test of time and survived  two possible ends of civilization as we know it but it has survived both of these events because  those who 
none	 guard it stayed to guard it  you may be hardpressed to convince others to step beyond the walls knowing that such a danger  could use that to their advantage and destroy the greatest city that we know of you are welcome to  ask but it will be a difficult journey what i can offer though my mate is a keeper of much  hidden knowledge over on his side of taldorei i may be able to send you to him to seek this  information  laura much hidden knowledge  sam about these vestiges perhaps  
none	 laura does he serve your same god or another  matt i am one of the chosen of ioun he does not serve her directly  liam information is welcome and we are thankful and we have been impressed by your wisdom very  much so the people you employ are chosen very carefully and very well and we all have been  impressed in addition to information you provide a service with the slayers take to vasselheim do  you have any interest in spreading that influence to emon if we can save it  matt her large paws 
none	 cross once again and she looks at you with a stern expression there is  great danger and darkness in this world and there are many fools who stand up in hopes that they  can keep it at bay if we were to lend our power to you i would ask that you prove yourselves the  ones that could carry this torch  liam how so  matt perhaps find these relics gather other allies prove to me that i would not be sending my  people to their doom then return perhaps then when you think you 
none	 are ready we could lend our  guild to your service  laura all right  marisha and where does your partner reside  matt she closes her eyes and concentrates for a moment south of the frostweald the mountain  range that guards it her eyes open again understand that it is our nature to present  challenges part of his journey to seek him is to find him yourself that is the first step  marisha does he have a name  matt it is his name to give  laura one small question osysa im sorry  
none	 liam no no  laura you serve the goddess of knowledge of openness  matt and she steps back and you see the crystal sphere the heartstone that she once helped you  look through before to look back at the world glows beneath framing light under her form  yes  laura does that mean you would know anything of the god of secrets vecna  matt as you say that name she snarls roars it would do you right to not mention that name in  this place  laura i apologize  matt yes i know of 
none	 him  taliesin his touch has been felt in the north  laura very close to here actually would you know of a way to rid ourselves of his weapon of  his tool  matt if i did we would have done so long ago this creature is one of the few entities that  shrouds my vision the limits of our sight of the things we seek to discover and unveil are  constantly balked by the veil of darkness he throws over the world he may have been held at  bay many thought destroyed hundreds of 
dung	 years ago but no he stays and he squeezes a stranglehold  on everything we seek to accomplish  liam well then allow us to do you a service we have had dealings with his underlings we have  knowledge which we freely give freely if it does anything to help our case winning your aid  and we will seek your partner and we will find your partner were not trying to score points we  are trying to do right percival  matt what do you know  taliesin dark creatures attempted to as best that we can 
none	 surmise open a gate beneath the  castle of whitestone  matt whitestone she steps back for a second her eyes flare up with energy again you can see  the heartstone embedded in the floor of the stone glow even brighter and brighter as she puts her  paws in the side and peers into it she begins to mutter beneath her breath i can see the snowy  north of taldorei the castle beneath one of our corrupted temples forgotten long ago  taliesin your temples  matt the ziggurats were not of his construction but he took 
none	 them her eyes wince for a moment  her head turns for a minute her vision and face staring in the distance i look out to follow the  anger the swath of death and hatred those who took emon they draw my gaze something is  happening  laura right now  taliesin what do you see  matt the path to westruun eastward  laura whats east of westruun who has the map  matt parts smoldering and left behind the path continues over the lucidian ocean eastward beyond  the shores of wildemount her head looks up 
none	 still staring off into the distance into the  drimaulth ravine  i see the floating islands of draconia falling crumbling gone  an army sundered people ruined the conclave sated returns towards your land once more you  can see blood pouring out of one of her nostrils now the light dulls in her eyes and the  heartstone fades for a moment she gathers herself i peered too far beyond the veil that  contains me im sorry my pained grunt she plops down and is breathing a little heavy  will can i heal you  matt 
none	 she takes a few steps down towards you brother kashaw it would be appreciated  will puts his hand around the medallion closes his eyes puts his hand out touches her  matt thank you she steps up and bows her head to you she steps to the top of the temple once  again ive seen this darkness you speak of under whitestone and i shall speak out to our brethren  of ioun in hopes of discovering the nature of this shadow im sorry i must rest  taliesin of course  liam we thank you for your 
none	 time we are your willing allies  matt return when you have proven yourself  mary we shall  matt when you think this conclave could possibly be felled beneath your weapons and might and  will she whips around the wings whoosh as the torches atop the temple flare out and you can see  the edge of osysas form as she dives into the shadow to the back of the temple you can hear the  impact of giant footfalls against sand and then silence  liam zahra  mary yes  liam you said we shall have 
none	 we convinced you  mary knowing that there are four dragons at least  laura at least  mary four to eight dragons according to grog out there and after our dealings with rimefang i  cannot let this go you know i cannot kash  will z this is fucking happy fun bunch over here they bring death with them everywhere they  go this isnt our fight  mary not all of them  sam i dont kill very much at all  will good to know  taliesin didnt you kill the king of  will except 
none	 for kings all right  marisha we just had a thirdparty perspective  sam yeah i mean she gave us a lot to sphinx about  groaning  travis wow  sam no no  mary its nice to know burt reynolds is still around  matt theres a very slow clap echoing into the cavern as vanessa goes  laughter  matt and to think i might have briefly missed you  laughter  laura we should leave the temple  sam wait did osysa just tell us she could possibly send us to her partner  laura she 
none	 told us where he is and we have to find him  sam oh we have to make our way  will you have to find the noname guy whos going to help you find the stuff thats hidden that  nobody knows where it is  laura i thought we were finding the stuff thats hidden while were finding him  mary we will find her mate he who is not named  will well as long as its not convoluted  marisha he is south of the frostweald in the mountains  laura i hate to thay this 
none	  liam yeth  mary speak freely  laura so these vestiges are ancient right spread across the land wasnt tiberius looking  for a bunch of objects of magic that his people had sent him to find perhaps thats the reason  draconia was hit maybe they were trying to hide these items  taliesin its possible  sam thats a big what if  liam do you really think the mending wheel  though would help us against thordak  marisha i feel like well know if its an ancient vestige of divergence  taliesin this is good 
none	 this is a path for us to walk  mary so draconia is gone is that my understanding  taliesin well most likely yes  mary what else is left  laura vasselheim whitestone  marisha zahra kash  laura potentially syngorn even though its hidden  mary well we can either stay here or we can  liam theyre opting out of the conversation  marisha have either of you been near pyrah in the mountains east of here have any of you been  where the fire ashari reside  mary i have not  will no  
none	 taliesin going to have to make our way there eventually  sam a lot to do  laura its a lot to do  sam maybe we should split up into eight groups  taliesin actually 11 groups  mary that would be 12  laura how many is that grog  travis four  laughter  marisha do we know how far away the frostweald is from here  matt the frostweald is back in  laura by westruun  matt south of westruun  marisha like where we started right in stillben  matt that was where you 
none	 got the heart of the nymph  marisha thats not far from the air ashari correct  liam do you think shes still there grog  travis oh yeah trust me when you have grog you never leave  liam yeah thats the expression im pretty sure thats the expression  laura we need to find kima we need to go to the temple of bahamut  sam yes youre right yes  laura talk to people that are capable of helping us  liam we need kima potions first i dont want to bore kima then kima yes  
none	 laura hey does the slayers take have potions we can just have dont they have like a supply room  liam it would be welcome  matt we have things we can provide as you are members  laura oh good yes  matt mind you not extremely active members as of late but  laura but we will be think about the giant amount of claws and teeth and eyeballs and leather  wings and scales  liam were about to get really fucking active  laura were going to be so fucking rich  mary think of the

tavern	 and this ale is like our tree okay we hug the ale and kima  will show up thats my theory  matt while this is happening vex you glance over her shoulder to the entryway to this bar and  you see stepping in a familiar burly looking halforc gentleman  marisha damn it i was hoping it was kima  taliesin that would have been hilarious  matt he walks in wiping his hands from dirt in the mines stops looks over at your table slowly  backs out of the tavern and steps back out into the

none	 bunch of big jackedout guys in there  matt not as big as him no but theres plenty of others that train under him all sorts of  warriors weapons of all kinds its kord he looks over and you see in the distance the giant  statue of kord that sits atop the trial forge he looks over and with a look of reverence gives a  nod and you can see that this man a glimmer of faith in his eyes he himself probably a follower  of kord as well hes a great man im not the 
none	 right temperament it seems but thats fine hes  getting along okay  travis right i wont take up too much more of your time but if i could ask you one last thing  aside from the slayers take and the trial forge if you had to find men at arms men to attack a  very large foe possibly quite dangerous where would you go  matt probably the platinum sanctuary between them and the trial forge thats most of the  actual army most of its trial forge its part of what the braving grounds are about 
none	 they train  the armies here its where they breed warriors  travis yeah  matt most of the bastions that look over the city are trained here so its those are my best  bets at least not much of a political man  travis well its been good seeing you no one hit quite as hard as you did  matt you too um the medal was a joke i was in a sore place literally a very very sore place  travis uhhuh  matt i wanted to apologize for that  travis uhhuh  matt i

tavern	 grog can you get this door open  laughter  mary it is open darling come on  sam are we going to kima now or are we going to go see grog fight  liam is grog fighting  matt to your left around the heavens stair the giant mountain that bisects the northern portion  of vasselheim around that way a little bit of travel but that heads towards the bahamut section  of the city where the platinum sanctuary is to your vision immediately outside the tavern you  can see the giant statue of kord where 
none	 the trial forge is and to the south of you is where the  quadroads are in the southern regions what do you guys want to do  travis i dont really feel like fighting i just want to go talk to master splinter at the trial forge  sam sure sure all right we can do that another day maybe or do you want to  travis im not in a rush  laura should we go to the platinum sanctuary where kima is right  taliesin lets go talk to kima  liam yeah right now  laura 
none	 oh should we wait until some people are more sober  mary no im all right coffee helps coffee helps  laura walking will help  mary walking and coffee  sam maybe we should they can wait outside or something  marisha but i miss kima  travis oh jesus  matt its been a few hours and you guys have had some coffee so youre still a little tipsy but  youre not useless  laughter  matt to put it nicely all right so where do you guys want to head into  laura the platinum sanctuary 
none	  matt all right you guys make your way south southwest around the curvature of the base of the  heavens stair you can see up along the mountain itself large ominous this monolith of earth  that looks over the entirety of vasselheim you can see embedded in the rock itself there are  various homesteads toward the base as you look up you can see theres a number of stairways that  just spiral around in different directions you can see small cliffs and precipices that are built  on the outside and look to be either various 
none	 places of individual worship where statues are  just barely visible cresting on the edge theres a number of constructs just built into this  mountain that are probably as old as the city itself  you make your way around the south portion of it back into the actual area of vasselheim the  silver talons reach which is where largely  bahamuts worship occurs you make your way past the  scattered temples all the different huts and hovels that build the central residential real  estate to this territory there are a few homes here that look 
town	 a little bit like this town is  built on existing in hardship and difficulty so a lot of people here are just stern folk that live  amongst terrible weather and money and wealth isnt really presented or flaunted in this city  its considered in very poor taste as everyone here is in some way shape or form to some level  is pious to some degree to one of the deities that are worshipped here you find your way to the base  of the stair that you recall following when you first arrived here in vasselheim 
none	 that leads up to  the platinum sanctuary where you were delivering the horn of orcus originally  travis oh thats right  matt you follow it up the side and it is an extended staircase that curves up to these three  silver spires that are pushing out from the side of the mountain quite a ways up after about  almost 20 minutes of stair climbing your legs start to cramp a bit but you manage to make your  way towards the top the outside of the large stone doors there you can see there are two 
none	  scalebearers of vord in their silver armor blue cloaks at their back weapons at the ready just  looking out and as soon as you guys approach the top of the stairway they change their stance to  be a little more prepared  marisha panting guys this is hard to do  with alcohol in your system  will hard to do at all  liam a lot of horses and chickens around here too  will i noticed that as well  liam everywhere  marisha i didnt know this was a farming industry  sam hello 
none	 there excuse us we are of the slayers take is that a good thing  laura yes  sam we are of the slayers take and we ask for entry into your platinum temple  matt your business is with whom  laura lady kima  matt turns nods to the other guy they both grab these small handles and give a tug and the door  opens slightly and one of the guys disappears between the two doors about 30 seconds pass to a  minute before he steps back out your presence has been accepted by the highbearer 
none	 vord the  silvertouched he will greet you in the central chamber please  sam thank you how do we address him  matt highbearer would suffice  sam all right  matt please enter  liam will kima be there  matt he doesnt answer the doors open even wider  liam hey  matt so as you guys enter the chamber once more this is close to where you flew in in bird form  and almost got arrested by the highbearers  marisha uhhuh right those guys  matt so as you enter the chamber you see 
none	 a number of the guards have already assembled and  theyre giving you a walkway path both as a presentory arrival vigil but also making sure  that you dont wander off the predestined path to the main central meeting chamber  will but it doesnt seem antagonistic in any way  matt no just theyre protecting their temple  sam well make it that though  matt you guys continue inward towards the central chamber the high stone ceiling before  you you can see there are holes carved throughout the ceiling and the stonework that cause beams of 
none	  light to come shooting through from the sky what catches your interest in here is that the sky is  cloudy there is no specific source of direct sunlight yet there are beams of light within the  temple itself that form a pattern across the stone marble floor of the central chamber  marisha can i do a nature check  matt certainly  laura whats the pattern look like  matt the pattern resembles a large shield when you look at it its pointed toward the base of  where you guys are walking in and fills 
none	 most of the chamber in an oval fashion before coming  together in a line towards the back  marisha 17  matt 17 okay this definitely isnt a natural occurrence the sunlight should not be projecting  this way which leads you to believe that theres something about the temples enchantment or its  construction that can either dissipate the veil of clouds to the sunlight or produce their own light  to mimic it during all hours  marisha cool  will do any of us recognize the symbol on the floor  matt youve seen the shield 
none	 itself is akin to the symbol of bahamut which is a shield with a  silver dragon head on it youve seen kima use it previously when you guys were looking after her in  the underdark  laura we never got that stuff back  sam her stuff  laura yeah  matt as you guys push to the central chamber you can see theres a line of three heavily armored  knights of bahamut that are all there standing shields at the ready big tower shields that  almost touch the ground two of them separate to one 
none	 side and one separates to the other and in  the center arriving before you is highbearer vord the silvertouched who some of you are  seeing for the first time long light brown hair that crests down past his shoulders his features  are very elven very soft and ageless but there is a very faint bluish hue to his skin his eyes  have no irises no pupils steps forward and extends his hands it is good to see such  friends so i ask you once again to join me in this chamber can i help you 
none	  liam whispers yes  laura you can actually well we hope that you can as it concerns dragon matters we know that  you serve bahamut the great the wonderful the very metallic these very terrible colored  chromatic red green lots of different dragons theyve attacked  sam how much do you know about the dragon attacks that have been raging across the world  matt he looks about the rest of you with a discerning glance just spending a beat on each of  you almost like youre being judged and read in that instant you feel 
none	 as if someone is prying  into your personality with but a glance and its unsettling at first but nothing too invasive  just enough to catch you off guard as he finishes the sweep of the party at hand i was given a  vision in the night of a far city of man swathed in ice and flame of colors bonded and unleashed  and i feared it was the work of our lords nemesis  laura straightup nemesis  marisha yes can you elaborate  matt he puts his hand up  marisha sorry  matt however 
dung	 with much prayer of mine and my acolytes we find no tremor of the dragon queen  nor the stench of baator on this business  marisha dragon queen baator is that what he said baator  matt baator baator  mary is the queen im sorry are the queen and baator the same  matt make a religion check  laura all of us or just  matt all of you sure make a religion check  laura 20  marisha ten  laura 12  mary 15  travis 18  will 24  liam 13  taliesin 
none	 13  will 24  matt okay none of these ring a bell except for you kashaw the dragon queen is indeed the  nemesis of the platinum dragon bahamut it is an entity known as tiamat and is essentially the  patron of most chromatic dragons she resides in baator which is one of the nine hells  laura eugh  matt however it seems that vord is speaking in a way that through much disturbed interest and  prayer into this matter there doesnt seem to be the scent of tiamats doing in this matter and  strangely 
none	 you see a bit of the tension in his face relax as he tells you this  laura so if its not the nemesis the big nemesis then you guys could probably take out  these dragons like no problem since theyre not the big bads theyre just really bad  matt while these entities do concern us there is the alternate vow that weve spoken and that  is to protect vasselheim the city has stood as long as it has because we have not left our post  and the moment that we were to attempt to move 
none	 even a minority of our people in the city to be of  aid to you in this endeavor this would be the moment that the dragon queen will be waiting for  to attack our citadel there are many more forces beyond these dragons that you speak of in this  world bent against the destruction of this city and we stand because we hold vigil here  marisha but sir you should understand how close this destruction came from your doorstep  matt and yet it avoided our city do you know why because even such creatures know 
none	 better than  to lend their talons against us  marisha but how do you know that will happen the next time is that always where youre going to  place your bet  matt do you think this will be the first time that ancient dragons have attempted to attack our  fair city  marisha how about four  matt i can guarantee you should they mount an attack on us four or not they will fall  laura wow then i guess everybody in the world can just move here  will wait a second you said 
none	 dragons have attacked before and they were defeated how  matt well we had the aid of bahamut with us at that time and he glances up and you look up and  you can see the rays of sun that have come through here from your current position you can see  actually form a matching symbol not of a shield but of a giant winged dragon outstretched across  the curved roof of this temple  liam but lets talk about  laura hes saying something  mary please continue im so sorry  liam my bad  
none	 will weve been drinking  matt drinking  will no water long walk up  matt well understand i hear your plight and i understand that we must aid you in this endeavor  best that we can but we cannot swear to you our army  laura what sort of aid can you offer then  matt well now while you seek out whatever your plot is to tear these creatures from their summit  we will grant to you from our place in the dawn city our finest champion while i have no  resources to offer at 
none	 this time this champion shall come to your aid to help in any way that  they can and once they can report their certainty that victory can be had perhaps we may be able to  send a little more of our power your way  sam will we know the presence of this champion or will it be a silent one  matt the champion is here and he steps aside and puts his hand out and one of the armored  knights steps forward full armor this tall widechested masculine form you cant see the  face 
none	 the helmet protects it but the shield comes out and slams the ground and goes to kneel on one knee  your charge platinum knight udire one of our finest warriors whom has had time and time again  at which point you hear a loud clang sound as all of a sudden udires thrown off of  his feet his shield bent in and skidding across the ground you see stepping up behind a female  halfling scar across the face  laura fuck yeah  matt  goldtrimmed armor blue cloak behind her shouting out oh no you 
none	 dont this is my  home turf im going  laura kima  marisha yeah kima  taliesin well take that one  marisha we want that one  matt highbearer vord rolls his eyes and sighs loudly growls kima you are in need of  discipline and guidance more than most who walk the warriors path your foolish impulses will get  you killed  marisha i think her foolish impulses are exactly what vox machinas looking for  matt she grins as she swings her maul slams it onto the stone ground a little bit of a rumble 
none	 as  you see a flash of divine energy from that and a beam from the sky comes down and frames her form  as she stands there clutching the top of it better to die a fool for something than live in  regret for doing nothing  travis church  laughter  matt an awkward pause as udire gets back up on his feet and pulls up the front of his helmet you  can see theres a very thin pencil stache underneath a chiseled jaw and a man who looks  like probably an intense chivalroustype knight 
none	 gentleman except theres a look of complete  disdain and frustration he gets up and goes really her vord raises his hand and grumbles  very well your new charge is lady kima whom you are already affiliated please keep her from doing  anything stupid  sam i think we want her to do her stupidest udire it would have been a swell adventure with  you maybe next time sir thank you for granting us this aid that we will definitely need in our  journey we also are new to this dragonslaying business and would love your 
none	 advice and any  information you might have especially about some specific items something called the  vestiges of divergence  matt his eyes squint for a moment as he puts his hands in front of his face hmm to step against  such powerful dragons is indeed a death sentence its true that you need to prepare arm yourselves  against this doom while we are meant to stay here in the most holiest of places these relics you  speak of from before the second spark still lie forgotten hmph these elements even balked the  primordials of 
dung	 old blades that slew the children of the dark where these relics lie only story  and tome can tell unfortunately know that at any given time you are not the only ones seeking this  power consider things of such great strength are perpetually in the minds of those who would make  their riches off of them or intend to take their own townships and peasantry under their own boot  and gauntlet well  mary do these vestiges help you control the dragons do you become their leader if you find them  matt i dont believe 
none	 any of that such capability but i also am not a scholar of ancient  magics and artifacts i have merely come across their whispers in books and various classes i took as a child  laura what sort of books fairy books  matt there are tomes scattered throughout the city and there is the cobalt reserve  laura cobalt reserve is gone the dragons took it out  matt that is unfortunate  marisha you said these tomes might still be in vasselheim  matt perhaps  marisha where  matt i wish i could tell you we 
none	 had one such entrusted to us long ago but that was destroyed  as part of the last assault on vasselheim that we withstood  laura do you remember the description of any of the items from your stories  sam or how many there were  matt the stories say of at least a dozen i cant be certain i wish i could be of more aid in  this but this is not a path that i chose to learn much on  marisha and are all artifacts necessary to defeating these dragons  matt i have no 
none	 idea  laura we should probably have asked  marisha osysa  matt though the warriors that once wielded these in the battles of old only seemed to have carried  one or two each  mary how did you defeat them the dragons that came to your doorstep  matt that was before my time my dear  mary there are no legends there are no scrolls that might recount the tale of how that happened  that you might still have somewhere  matt depends the second spark hmm he takes a moment to gather his thoughts as 
none	 i take a moment  to gather my notes  laughter  will while youre doing that udires stuck in his armor over there  travis dented in  will hes just dented in he cant get out  matt hes not happy at all about that  hold on got it  laura sorry one moment please  mary right here hold on  liam ive got all my dragon lore over here just give me a second  matt its a long tale and i recommend you research the history yourself but during the  times of creation 
none	 when the gods first came upon this world it was a place of chaotic energies  elements clashing the very landscape itself was in eternal turmoil wrestling for no purpose other  than the destruction of the others there were no boundaries yet the gods still came and they  created us the various beings and entities as they came to understand what their purpose was as  they themselves were still uncertain as to why they came to be they hoped that through their  creations they could learn more about themselves they began to watch the first burgeoning 
none	 elves  dwarves people within a short time a very short time the very chaotic nature of this landscape  consumed and destroyed most of what remained the only city that stood the first city vasselheim  the titans that walked across these lands great primordial elemental kings beings of no noble  mind sought to destroy any light or beauty thus the first war began the peoples rose up the gods  feet touched the ground and alongside their creations they slew the titans with the first of  these vestiges laying them to rest within the dirt within 
none	 the sky casting the elements away  from this plane and separate to their own where now they remain amidst fire earth air water  and their muddy boundaries between  thus came a time of great privilege and prosperity and it also came to be discovered that  some of the gods as part of creation during this bout with the titans began to question the  purpose of creation to embrace the chaos that they fought in this battle and they distanced  themselves from the ones that guide us to this day they began to take the 
none	 children of the gods  to corrupt them teach them the wonders of arcana magics beyond the divine the gifts of the gods  and for the first time the creations began to find power separate from the creators the  arrogance to think that perhaps now they were gods themselves now they were the gods  creations and they loved them very much so they did not see this as a threat but as the second  expansion of civilization spread across the world we saw rise great new towns and cities and  civilizations and cultures as well 
dung	 as a new wave of insolence and selfishness and these new dark  gods began to prey upon this and build a force to take those who still stay true to the first this  terrible war this is what we knew as the divergence this is when the people were split in two  the gods were divided as well bloody battles ensued and it looked as though while all other  cities fell into ruin even vasselheim would fall but in this time these vestiges were expanded  upon those first few weapons many more were created and 
dung	 the champions fought alongside the  gods once more and victory was had the dark gods banished to various planes far from this plane  but it was then the gods also decided that perhaps their delving had caused this and they receded  leaving the mortals to find their own way to rebuild a second time with the warning of the  dangers of arcane which vasselheim still to this day holds in its prime oaths many of these  vestiges that you seek were destroyed but some were kept some were lost some were entombed  some were 
none	 refound and rediscovered and used as symbols of power but since this second spark of  civilization the gods felt that the true penance was the destruction of all their people had built  and the gods leaving us to our own thus started the penance where to this day we still make up  for the infractions and sins of our arrogant brothers and sisters of that day so since then  weve had other new civilizations spring up wildemount taldorei syngorn marquet these are  the newer cities of the third age  liam may i ask vestiges 
none	 the word in these legends it seems vague does no one know anything  about what they were is that a standin for things we dont understand or know about what are  these vestiges  matt we know of them understand artifacts and relics of this power are very dangerous and what  better way to hide things of such power than to destroy the knowledge of where they may be or even  if they exist  marisha sir i come from the ashari people  matt yes  marisha we are here to protect those boundaries that 
none	 we set several thousand years ago do you  think that some of this knowledge might still be within my people  matt it is possible i am not a practitioner of the history of the ashari people  will objects with that much power have to leave some trace somewhere anything you can think of a  place to start  matt cobalt reserve there the monks keep some of the most ancient of texts we here at  vasselheim keep a watchful eye on things that relate to the wars of old the history of our  deities 
none	 of our temples to not repeat the mistakes we have the monks are more eclectic  in their collections perhaps they can be of more aid  laura maybe not all of the reserve was destroyed maybe they have secret rooms underground where  they keep the most ancient texts we should at least check  taliesin it would be worth looking at the very least  laura allura was on her way there  sam highbearer these dragons who are running rampant across the world them being chromatic  dragons do you think they have pledged their loyalty to 
none	 the queen  matt if they have its a very no they would not be able to shroud the sight of the platinum  dragon himself  laura isnt it very strange for dragons to pledge their allegiance to any other dragon  matt for chromatics it is  laura then why are they serving the red one  matt the red one  travis the cinder king  laura thordak  marisha thats what he calls himself  laura hes ancient he was in the fire realm the fire plane and broke free and now he has  other 
none	 dragons serving him  matt chromatic dragons respond to a few things gold dominance and strength if this red dragon  is as ancient and as powerful as you say perhaps he even he could bully lesser dragons  marisha or do you think its possible he is offering any one of those rewards  matt there are many possibilities you would have to ask one of them yourself  taliesin i get the distinct feeling we will get that chance  marisha so if this is the third age does that mean the fourth is upon us  matt 
none	 i hope not  marisha as do i  matt but if it does we will do everything we can to see that this city stands it is the only  link we have to the past should vasselheim fall i dare say all is lost  mary at the cost of everything else vasselheim stands thats my only question  matt that is your question  mary yes  matt from here civilization could spring anew people could defend themselves and thrive  thereafter the rest of the world is scattered petty squabbles selfish personal endeavors that  lead 
dung	 to foolishness and treachery should this city fall and one of those remain that is a  breeding ground for the dark powers that lie beyond the veil it is only here that those who  are the most devout could truly have the hearts and minds to guide us bahamut forbid into a  fourth age  sam well thank you for all your help one more question before we leave you to your  matt which you see kima slams her hammer on the ground oh my god can we just go im sick of  hearing him 
none	 rattle on  vord puts his hand out kima  sam on our journey we may have to travel long distances quite often is there any means of quick  travel to other parts of the continent from vasselheim  laura perhaps any flying carpets that you have lying around  sam airships teleportation circles any means that you know  matt we do not deal in such teleportation magics beyond the divineprovided ones and those i  assume are beyond most of you however there is still the skyport which i believe you arrived in  when you first 
none	 came to us other than that if none among you are able to achieve any sort of  distance translocation then i highly doubt you have the ability to stand up against these dragons  you seek to destroy  marisha we got it its fine its handled  laura thank you for the vote of confidence  taliesin i think we have everything we need here  laura yes unless you have any amulets or magical things lying around  sam hows that horn of orcus going by the way  marisha good question actually  matt shh  
none	 sam oh sorry  taliesin ixnay on the ornhay  sam sorry  matt and with that  laura so no on the magic items of protection  matt i have business for the day  laura cool  will im not going to ask him how his family is  sam no dont do that  matt show our guests out please  with pleasure slings her maul up on her shoulder lets step outside first  marisha yeah  matt and she leads you all outside the temple doors close as soon as the doors close she tells 
none	  the two guards shove off please we have to have a conversation the guards kind of  frustratedly turn around and go back and close the door as soon as the doors close behind them  she goes oh my god guys  cheering  matt she rushes out gives hugs to everyone that she knows she skips you asks to be introduced  to and  laura zahra kima  mary im zahra  matt zahra nice to meet you  mary nice to meet you kima  matt kima lady kima  mary lady kima lady all

none	 the airship  taliesin followed by the airship  matt earthbreaker as in dawn marshal the great dawn marshal of chuckles ive only seen him  from a distance hes a roughlooking fella  travis yeah right hes got a pair of arms on him doesnt he  matt im excited to see this puts it over her shoulder and shes walking down her little legs  clanging with her armor down the stairs  travis hold up kima hold up what do you mean have you spoken with him before  matt ive seen him punch someones head clear 
none	 off  laura off of his body  sam that is so cool  will you only turn them into paste  liam level up  travis im excited  mary oh oh dear  matt laughs youre not the only one and she continues rushing ahead you get the feeling  that kimas been locked up and been doing temple stuff for quite some time and is very happy to get  out of her general duties  liam lead the way shitkicker  matt you guys head back down the outside of the heavens stair making your way 
town	 back to the  outside of the trial forge you can still see now its middle of the afternoon all the forges  throughout the town are in full steam you see big plumes of black smoke pouring out of the various  steelworks  marisha on our way there i pace next to kash so do you have you met kima  will no  marisha i get the feeling that you guys knew each other  will no never met kima in my life she didnt seem to like me very much which is odd because  everyone 
none	 else seems to think im an amazing guy vax and vex everyone telling me they love my  eyes they love this i dont know its weird bunch of your friends are just very weird  marisha you seem really put off by it i didnt know it was so  will im not used to being around people all the time i have one real friend and thats z im  only with her because she saved my life id do anything for her everybody else is odd for me  marisha yeah i feel that  will there

none	 redcolored monument temple to kord very rigid and very much a temple  built to withstand its a fortress more than a temple and you see above it still across the lip  at the very top at the front walkway a little bit of the kord statue looking over the entirety of  this section of vasselheim  travis oh boy  matt the doors are actually ajar theyre open  travis oh  matt there are two dawn marshals there in their armor with the colors of kord as you approach  they step out of the way 
none	  laura ooh  travis yes clearly my presence is recognized in this great hall good day good day  laughter  travis wouldst thou care to follow me inside  sam lets do this  liam verily verily  laura huzzah i say my lord  marisha my liege  matt as you walk in the two dawn marshals that are out there put their arms together and they  lower their head and bow and as you enter they close the doors behind you guys the doors slam  behind you and you feel the stone shift from 
none	 the impact of the thud 25 30foottall doors that  mark the front of this  travis its all right pucker up were okay  matt the echo of the stone slam down the long hall you can see there are large pillars that  mark the run to the central chamber youve been here before and as you walk across the smooth  very very simple stonework ahead you can see there is the central portion its almost like a  giant cross like both sides of the temple meet in the center and there is a circular dip 
none	 in the  ground not really a pit its only about four feet down but its filled with a coarse sand and  as you guys walk up to that edge each monk acknowledging you as you pass quietly you can  hear the gentle chanting in the distance of low rumbling gregorian voices chanting and there  sitting in the center of this open circular sand patch is the earthbreaker himself he is sitting  there legs crossed arms resting at the edge of his knees eyes closed you can see even from  here for those who havent 
dung	 seen him before he wears simple freeflowing pants of a dark reddish  color with a gold trim on the sides but theyre tattered towards the bottom he has a oneshoulder  wrap across the front there and these large prayer beads that hang around his neck his skin is very  dark and weathered by sun and training and he is probably the most muscular human being you have  seen for his proportional form he is a human being built for discipline and physical martial  training and battle older though still you can see his long grey 
none	 beard that rests about middle to  his chest the balding on the front a little bit the rest of his grey hair rests to his midback  and he just sits there quietly in the center the rest of the monks have gathered up and begun to  form around the circle  travis how many monks would you say  matt right now about 15  travis onefive  matt yeah  laura are they talking at all or are they all superquiet  matt superquiet  travis i walk up to within 20 feet of earthbreaker groon 
none	  matt okay so you leap down into the sandpit  travis yeah  matt okay so you guys on the side grog you leap off  travis how deep is it lowered  matt you dont know how deep it is but its its not its hard sand its packed so you just  kind of  travis yeah but i meant the depression is it like a couple feet  matt right the depressions like an inch  travis okay cool  matt oh you mean the depression into the actual ground  travis yeah  matt about 
none	 four feet  travis oh shit yeah so  matt so you vault into it in a bound  travis does he move at all  matt no hes still facing a little bit away from you in the far corner  travis i put my fist in my hand and i bow slightly does he move at all  matt the silence is broken immediately by a low rumbling voice that seems to have no particular  source in the vicinity where you stand it says you come because your lands now harbor a terrible  conflagration how do 
town	 you think groon can assist still facing away from you  travis we have traveled near and far great grood  marisha its like sesame street  travis and we would like to request upon you a moment of your time  will why is he doing the talking why is he doing the talking  matt as most of you noticed this time his name is groon  laughter  matt at which point he stands up and you know would only come to about your sternum  heightwise but hes just this tense every muscle is seemingly theres 
none	 not an ounce of fat  on this body and  travis like a protein shake  matt yeah  sam paleo  matt turns around towards you and says you stray from the darkness that i warned you but  this current distraction is too great even your blood is drawn to the flames of promise and power  this shall be a test to see if you will break against the shadow  sam what shall be a test  laura whats the test  matt i know many things grog strongjaw  travis he said my full 
none	 name  matt but such knowledge is earned not given  marisha whispers shit you might have to fight this motherfucker  matt where do you find your strength  liam whispers whats he talking about grog  matt as youre thinking in a blinding instant you see a flash of movement and like a dagger in  your stomach his elbow is impact sound  groaning  matt moved three feet in an instant and has slammed you right in the center of your abdomen the breath  just escapes you as you fall back unable to really catch 
none	 yourself and just land flat on your  back in the sand  travis wheezing sounds  marisha were all hanging back  matt puts his arm down  marisha just watching  matt strongjaw where do you find your strength  travis in my anger  matt you walk between worlds weakness in mind or weakness in conviction what do you stand for  where do you find your strength at which point as youre getting up theres another blinding  flash for a second and your feet are left out from under you go ahead and make an 
none	 athletics check  because youre now prepared for this one  will jeez  taliesin gonna get smackdown  travis 19  matt your feet go out from under you as you slam onto your back you just barely caught your breath  before its almost knocked out again hes looking down at you this time once again his eyes just  white choose choose the two here who would save you  travis whispers pikes not here  matt who would push you to your potential choose your bloody muses  sam does he mean us or  travis

none	 is a 32  matt okay good that hits  liam and then the second one is a 27 and the third one is a 17  matt first two hit  liam first two hit and the first one is sneak attack with the blunt edge  matt right which is doubled because hes unconscious  liam yeah it is  matt melee attack within five feet  liam oh im so sorry nine plus whoa that is ten 16 22 23 25 is 50 plus the 59 59 for  the first  matt 59 hoo  liam

none	 attack even though he was unconscious  matt well he woke up after you slammed him second attack hits and in reaction as he sees you  rush off he kicks his leg up and manages to catch you  liam yeah im feeling that  matt it doesnt manage to trip you but it does deal  liam uncanny dodge  matt so you deal half the damage on that all right so you take what would be 12 points of  damage you take six points of bludgeoning damage  liam ah fucking ankle come on  will 
none	 it was still uncanny  matt it was quite uncanny all right that ends your turn  liam yes  matt all right its now his turn all right so  liam im so acrobatic  travis were waiting to see if hes awake or not  matt so yeah until the spell ends you can use your action every turn to try and give him another  effect if you wanted to scanlan so he still has eyebite but hes conscious  sam can i change the effect or does it always have to be  matt you can 
none	 if you want to when it comes to your next turn but it has to be on your turn to  use your action to do it he gets up using half his movement which is fine hes going to as he  looks over and you can see him glance to the side of grog and see where you are as the giant crack  in the side of his head and the blood thats trickling down the side of his face he just  rushes around still in melee with you so he doesnt get an attack of 
none	 opportunity and hes  gonna go unarmed attacks on you for three natural 20 thats a 17  liam no  matt with your haste yeah you get a bonus so thats a miss and that is a 25  liam that hits two of those hit  matt all right so the crit 28 points of bludgeoning damage and the last one is gonna be  14 points of bludgeoning damage and hes going to use three ki points as he comes around elbows  you to the side of the face you just werent expecting it and it 
none	 cracks you and you feel like a  tooth crack and the pain sears through your jaw and youre like ugh and then he brings his lower  hand and impact hits you right in the center of the abdomen and it hits you and it hurts but  its not as impactful as you thought it would be for the force but you feel like this strange  like quivering vibration in your midsection like almost like the muscles are spasming  uncontrollably and you dont quite understand why that is going to end his turn grog youre up 
none	  travis no and i go into a frenzied rage if its gonna be an assbeating we take we might as well  just get on with it and ill use reckless attack and great weapon master against him  matt okay go for it  travis which means he gets advantage on everything against me but fuck it hes hitting  anyway oh 19 so close 28  matt 28 hits  travis 23  matt 23 hits  travis 16  matt misses  travis damn it those were high okay  laura you couldve used your inspiration

dung	 strong and you end up jamming it  into his forearm as you pull away the blood streaks out each hit hes still focused on you  and hes not showing any pain hes not grimacing youre just seeing the wounds being had and hes  just still intent on moving and his expression focused on you  travis he made both those checks okay  matt yeah and at that moment he looks at you and says you carry such a dark weapon with you  thats all he says is that the end of your turn  travis 
none	 yeah  matt all right scanlan  sam hes still eyebitten  matt correct yes actually lets see he has to save at the end of his turn which he rolled a  one so no  sam all right instead of sleeping this time i would like him to just get sick be sick i want  him to be sick now  mary what kind of sick  laura like pukey or like the other one  sam oh he has like diarrhea  marisha thats the worst  laura oh man thats so embarrassing  matt all 
none	 righty yeah as you keep focusing you can see his form shifts a little bit and you  swear you hear the cramping of someones abdominals in the distance like an unhappy  digestive tract  sam you didnt sleep well did you no  liam like a tree cracking in the wind from this guy  sam and i will turn to vax this time and inspire him and i will say singing kill that monky  douchebag white boy kill that monky douchebag right take out your daggers and kill that monky  douchebag til he dies

none	 said thats not what you said  matt its not a surprise attack  liam so it doesnt stack  matt no  liam yeah but hes hes up against grog so i get  matt which is meaning you get sneak attack so youre doing sneakattack damage on him you  critically hit so you just double your sneak attack damage  sam just take your 80 points of damage not your 160 points  liam so i double sneakattack damage  matt yeah you said quadruple its not quadruple its just times two  liam 23 the sneakattack 
none	 damage is  laura thats 28 times two  liam 56 all right yeah  mary thats good theres no disappointment there  taliesin and now you add your knife  liam 68  matt oh total of 68 gotcha  liam critical hit on a sneak attack got it got it got it  matt he is going to use a ki point to deflect missiles  liam im gonna use my last bit of luck so that he has to roll again  matt okay all right its not an attack roll on this yet just so youre 
none	 aware  liam okay  matt this is him just reducing the damage he takes from it  liam oh all right  matt so that is a total of he reduces the damage by 13 he still takes the impact but he manages  to slow the blade with his hands before it finds itself in his chest and he rips it out you can  see the spray of blood that hits in the sand across the front before the dagger disappears from  his grip  liam and i duck behind scanlan  matt all right  
none	 sam dont hide behind me  liam yeah sure its that was a four ten  matt nope this one  liam no i rolled i rolled a bunch of times didnt i roll a bunch of times okay all right  well she rolled a 20  matt for nothing  liam i rolled a oh that did fine its a 27  matt wait so you did a total of 60something damage on him from the one attack  laura yeah  matt yeah got you yes the second one does  liam second one is ten  
none	 matt yeah so the second one attack hits go ahead and roll for it or roll for damage  liam nine  matt nine okay cool cool  liam im scared to death which is why the math is so bad  matt thats good well as it comes back to groons turn groon you can see the blood is just  pouring out of the wound that you left he takes one hand and just impact sound slams it really  hard and it just kind of the impact sears the wound cauterizing it  liam dont want to 
none	 be fighting you  matt still looking at you he puts his hand out and does this and that quivering in your stomach  you felt earlier begins to shake and the vibrations begin to spread through your entire  body i need you to make a constitution saving throw yeah  sam youve got inspiration still  laura does that work on saves  liam plus inspiration  matt yeah  liam its a 23  matt 23 that is a success you manage to just stave it off as you can feel it about to tear your  
none	 insides apart and you just tense real fast and the vibrations slowly fade no effect  sam no effect  matt wouldve been 10d10 necrotic damage  sam 10d10  marisha what happened like a chestburster like came out of him  matt its called quivering palm its a monk ability  liam its uma thurman its fucking kill bill  marisha and will the fivepoint exploding palm technique  matt hes going to use another ki point a bonus action as he goes into a defensive stance a  familiar one that youve seen before  travis before i 
none	 whooped somebodys ass  matt yeah but into this fully defensive looking about and keeping his eyes aware of the entirety  of his surroundings and is going to stay right there that brings us to grog  travis piece of shit i dont know what that stance is i chop at him some more with craven edge i  dont know can i do one great weapon master and the other two just regular  matt yeah  travis okay im gonna do that  matt are you doing reckless attacks or not  travis yeah reckless  matt 
none	 okay his patient defense gives you disadvantage on all attacks he just nullifies  it so you just have one roll per attack  travis 16  matt misses just knocks the blade out with his own hand you hear it impact off to the side  travis 16  matt this time he actually catches with the two sides of his hand and throws it back towards you  sam you could be inspired god damn it  mary its right there  travis im gonna use my other d10 thats not tainted so not this one  sam 
none	 all you have to do is pledge allegiance to the washington football team  laughter  will wow  travis 27  matt 27 he goes to try and catch it but you change the direction of the blade at the last  minute and find the side of his flesh go ahead and roll damage  travis okay so 12 19  matt he does make his save on that  travis 29 damn it he does  matt 29 damage  travis 29 all that  matt hes got a decent constitution  travis yeah you think  
none	 matt all right so the third blade finally sinks in about two inches into his clavicle area and  probably would snap the clavicle bone if he hadnt put his hands up and caught as much of the impact  as he could and then throws it back again and just kicks you away to get a little bit of  distance  travis shit really little distance or  matt its just like a foot just away from being clenched up  travis okay can i move opposite of where my two lads are so i stay behind him 
none	 again  matt right there yeah you can do that go for it all right that ends your turn  travis yep  matt scanlan youre up well let me see actually if he resists the nope  sam still sick  matt actually actually no remembering this because i kept forgetting to do it before but  thats fine hes gonna use his legendary resistance to automatically succeed so he no  longer has eyebite  sam oh so hes done  laura hes not shitting himself anymore  mary no but the stench is great  matt so 
none	 sickness fades he spent last round not doing any actual physical  attacks for that reason  sam all right well im far away from him but grogs right next to him so i probably shouldnt  do anything too terrible  travis do it do it  liam but hes a sponge  travis do it if you dont do it he will do it  marisha thats why we have grog around  sam ill join in the bludgeonfest and i will cast sings bigbys hand and i will ill make  it come right next to him 
none	 sort of between him and grog i cant get between him and grog  matt there you go not between them no but you can put it like next to him or behind him  sam okay to the side to the side would be good and just punch just a couple punches just  throwing some punches  taliesin stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself  matt make a melee spell attack  sam melee spell attack  matt got it melee spell attack  sam what do i add  matt you add your spell 
none	 attack modifier which should be on your spell page  liam on your same page your spell page  sam spell attack bonus okay 27  matt 27 thats a hit as the hand appears to his right hes still focusing on grog and glances  over for a second and tries to do a deflection technically hes still in his defense stance  though so roll twice because he does have disadvantage for attacks on him  taliesin yeah thats good  sam that was a natural 20  matt yeah  sam but the disadvantage so the 27 
none	 yes oh wait now i roll for damage  matt yep  sam with bigbys hand i rarely do this  travis thats true yeah  matt 4d8 force damage  sam 4d8  laura you need to do that more thats pretty good  liam come on scanbo  sam ill just roll this one four times its fine 17  matt 17 damage  sam 4d8 right  matt yep so as bigbys hand pulls back with a giant fist the fingers cracking in an arcane  echo whack slams into his side he holds himself strong and 
none	 actually slides about seven inches in  the sand from the impact and you can see him shake off his arm from the hit yeah that hurt  sam decent decent and i will inspire grog again with a little ditty i will say singing  youre a psycho killer with a bearded face grog grog grog grog grog grog grog grog grog run r  thats fine  matt all right take your d10  laughter  matt all right vax youre up  liam i just drop to my knees so i can aim better and right over 
none	 scanlans shoulder  dagger dagger dagger  matt go for it  liam okay first one is a one so that misses second one is a 23  matt 23 youre rolling disadvantage on all these right  liam disadvantage for what  matt for all these attacks because hes still in his patient defense stance  liam oh shite  matt so what was this roll you just got  liam well the first one was a one and a  matt yeah first one missed the second one was a 23 and what did you roll  liam 
none	 i dont remember what it was sorry  matt roll again its fine  liam all right so this is the second attack that is a 17  matt misses  liam third attack is a 21  matt 21 misses  groaning  matt so all three daggers come at him and he just dodges one right off the head another one he  parries out of the way and the third one he does a crescent kick whack and knocks the dagger  out of the air that spins off to the side before it returns to your 
none	 belt  liam and just under my breath i say so fucking cool  laughter  matt at the end of your turn before its his turn hes gonna go ahead and use one action point to  use like the wind where he moves his speed without taking attacks of opportunity he turns  and rushes up to scanlan  sam im a little boy  matt starting his turn now hes gonna come for you scanlan hes gonna go ahead and do a flurry  of blows against you  laura oh no scanlan  matt so scanlan 
none	 first attack is 29  sam yeah  matt natural one fails on the second one  sam okay ill use cutting words on the last one  matt okay well the third one is a 20 and the fourth one is a 31  travis jesus  matt so three hits  sam but im using cutting words on the third one to try to  liam you said the last one  sam no i said the third one  marisha it doesnt matter they all suck  matt whichever one you want so the first one hits 
none	 cutting words to reduce the attack on the  sam on the one that was a 20  matt yeah so go ahead and roll your d10  sam okay six  matt six whats your ac  sam 17  matt yeah no so you manage to what do you shout at him as hes doing these punches against you  sam i sing singing no no no no dont phunk with my heart  laughter  matt he cocks his head like a confused puppy for a second and the fist just hits air above your head  
none	 travis youve gotta be kidding me man  matt however you do take 14 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike and  another 14 points of bludgeoning damage so a total of 28 points of bludgeoning damage from two  hits go ahead and make a dex saving throw if you could  sam dex dex dex  taliesin four  sam 16 oh plus four really okay oh yeah saw that for some reason theres a plus four  there 20  matt 20s what you need his last hit hes trying to kick you square in 
none	 the chest and knock  you off your feet and while it hits you it actually forces you back into vax and vax holds  you up and you manage to keep on your feet  liam whoa buddy  sam oh hi im between two strong men  liam debatable  sam im lucky pierre  matt or no its grogs turn its grogs turn because you just took yours yeah  travis its my turn yeah i just keep swinging away  matt so youre gonna move up to him  travis yes please  matt oh and 
none	 as a note i need you to make a concentration check for both of those hits they  were 14 damage each so and you have warcaster right  sam oh yes oh yes  matt so go ahead and make constitution checks constitution let me look at this  sam thats 11 plus two is 13 right not great not great and 14 13 and 14  matt okay yeah thats gonna end concentration bigbys hand off the table  sam gasps bigbys hand is gone  matt too much damage for you on that one so from the 
none	 impact of the blows you just managed the  spell fizzles from your mind and the hand dissipates into the distance all right now grog  travis at the end of his turn did he go back into his defensive pose  matt no  travis okay great okay so reckless attack thats lets make it great weapon master with the  inspiration 24  matt 24 hits  travis thank you  matt youve gotta say great weapon master before you roll by the way  travis should i do it for the next one then  matt yeah 
none	  travis okay so that one didnt  matt because it cant be like oh that doesnt hit im not gonna do great weapon master yet you  have to get the penalty before you roll  travis right that makes sense right so it was a 29 no i mean it wasnt what  matt you said it was a 24 for that one it wouldve been a twenty it hit regardless  travis okay hit regardless  matt so yeah so the first one was just a regular hit  travis so well do the third one will 
none	 be great weapon master this is disadvantage come on  where are the damn crits 20  matt 20 misses  travis yep okay this is great weapon master with adva with the inspiraton  matt yeah so  travis 28 no minus five 23  matt 23 just hits  cheering  matt so a regular hit and then a great weapon master hit  travis okay six 11 19 is the first one  matt 19 damage all right  travis fuck nine 17 27  matt 27 got it both of the strikes makes his save makes 
none	 his save  travis sputters not once  matt its a 12 dc its not a very hard dc for  travis yeah but hes gotta roll shitty sometimes  matt he probably will eventually so anyway as youre striking the blades at him the pain hes  just taking the pain to his back now because hes facing scanlan and both times hack into the  back of his shoulderblades and the exposed muscle you can see as the blade draws back you can see  the muscle and the blood arcing after each draw of the weapon however 
none	 he glances over his  shoulder at you as you finish your second blow and at the end of your turn hes gonna use two action  points to use whirlwind of blows  travis can i move oh i already moved  matt you already moved yeah i mean you can keep moving if you wanted to move away  travis i wanted to move in between him and scanlan just wrap around  matt you cant move between but you can get there if you want  travis okay thatd be good  matt okay so hes gonna 
none	 get an attack on everyone within range of his punches which would  be you and scanlan that is gonna be a 26 against you  travis yeah  matt and a natural 20 against scanlan  sam that doesnt hit that doesnt hit  laughter  matt first to you grog that is 18 points of bludgeoning damage halved to nine and scanlan  that is six no sorry 24 points of bludgeoning damage  sam ah thats not bad ill be fine  matt all right now its scanlans turn  sam oh shit i get to do

none	 save for half he gets no damage on his success so as you do lightning bolt he  literally just goes into the splits as the bolt streaks over his head  liam he van dammed it  matt slams one of the nearby pillars and as you realize that you look down at him as he squeezes  his legs back together and lands right back on his feet  will oh god he took no van dammeage  laughter  sam hes fast as lightning damn it  matt is that your turn  sam i mean thats

none	 hear his  voice piercing into your head that just says grog you are stronger than this thing that binds  you where do you find your strength  travis in my friends  matt the darkness around you immediately shatters and you can see now your friends off to the side  keeping their weapons ready the entirety of groons posture has dropped and he just bows  before you  cheering  mary yes yes  will wow  matt at this point he takes a moment and closes his eyes and you can see theres this inner 
none	 glow  in his chest and a bunch of his wounds heal up in but an instant and as those wounds leave these  scars he looks across the body i will wear these with pride  sam strained so will i  laughter  sam oh fuck zahra did you see how awesome that was i was really good  mary that was wonder you still have a little sand right there  matt at this point he groons not even looking at you guys still looking at grog he goes you  need not the strength of vasselheim
