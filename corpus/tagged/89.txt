none	  conclave destroying cities all across taldorei the party escaped sent the refugees they could  as well as allies back to whitestone seemingly not on the radar of this attacking front of  dragons at the moment and then made their way toward vasselheim to find allies pike staying  behind to help with the refugees at the moment upon going to vasselheim you managed to encounter  a number of old friends from the slayers take and enlist them for the time being to help you with  the refugees and your current wanderings here in the city 
none	 proper at the same time you encountered  lady kima who also has agreed to help with the events in whitestone and this entire dragon attack  towards the east and you after wandering the city for a bit retrieving these allies followed  grog into the trial forge where you had a conversation with earthbreaker groon and by  conversation i mean a fullon dragout sandpit battle to prove your worth to him in which case  you were given information about these things called the vestiges of the divergence artifacts  of great legendary power that existed from 
none	 previous wars that had wiped out most of society  multiple times these vestiges have been scattered around the world many of them lost to the history  books or passed down as symbols of power through various bloodlines or government positions or  stolen and havent been seen for hundreds of years youve found the location of two of them  one of which was the titanstone knuckles and the other happened to be some sort of a leather a  deathwalkers leather that belonged to a champion of the raven queen this exists in apparently the  champions 
tavern	 tomb which used to exist to the west of vasselheim until it eventually sunk into the  ground as the topography shifted over time and resides beneath a lake known as the marrowglade  loch so that is where we left off as you guys recovered from the encounter in the trial forge  and deciding on your plan going forward stepping from the tavern having a few drinks and  discussing the merits of your current path what would you like to do friends  travis that fucking hurt  laughter  travis old dude hit hard  mary 
none	 well done though  travis i mean we found two of the vestibules of  sam what did you find again brass knuckles of some sort  travis no no no he mentioned he mentioned titanstone knuckles  laura do you know about those  travis yeah yeah its a bit of a sensitive subject clears throat i think my uncle kevdak  has em  all what  travis yeah the leader of our wandering herd he has two prize weapons that he pretty much  used to use to beat me like near death  mary oh  
none	 sam and now we have them  all no  travis no we hes still got them  mary so where do you have any idea where they might be wandering  travis yeah its this thing i lost the gps tracker on them so no  laura you should use waze  laughter  mary sometimes it gets there well 20 minutes here or there  travis yeah but hes real strong and its only one of two really powerful weapons he has so hey  at least we know where one of them is  mary how is 
none	 your relationship with him now besides the fact that he used to beat the crap out  of you when you were younger  travis just peachy like  mary really  travis really great no its fucking terrible  mary oh thats lovely  travis yeah  marisha all right well we know where one is where are these leathers then from the raven  queen we need to figure out where the marrowglade loch is  mary the marrowglade loch  marisha do we know where that is  laura its a lake  mary i did get 
none	 a map from the slayers take is there anything on this map that would indicate  where the loch is  matt yeah the marrowglade loch resides about a seven to eighthour journey swift of foot to the  westsouthwest area of vasselheim and it is marked on the map its not marked as a major  place its just this sunken somewhat muddy swampish land youve passed  mary this wasnt the place that we passed on the way to go get rimefang was it there was  matt no no no no that was more north but you 
none	 passed this in your travels and some of your hunts  with the slayers take before but its never been a place of consequence it is just a lake that  exists on a map until this significance was given to it  mary so we so kash and i have passed it before  matt yeah id say probably some time in the past  laura so we know its relatively close we should probably head there  will if you think your uncles closer than eight hours away  marisha no hes on another continent  will then 
tavern	 hes probably not closer than eight hours away  mary or hes in the tavern down the street you never know  laura i feel like we need to we told  travis what  laura we keep changing places and nobodys going to know where we are pike is in whitestone how  do we let her know were moving or are we coming back here  sam wait where are we going marrowway cove what  mary and laura to the loch  taliesin well were only going for a day  liam that dragons days are numbered 
none	  marisha yeah i feel like if pike really needed to get a hold of us she could  taliesin we could also leave word for where were going  laura lets leave word at the slayers take that were heading out so if you know allura or pike  shows up wanting to find us  taliesin or god forbid if something happens to us they know where to retrieve our bodies  will the takes not coming out to retrieve our bodies  mary no they wont  will the takes not coming out theres no money in 
none	 your bodies  matt and kima at this point looks about and says well if we have plans to head east and probably  not spend much time here among vasselheim for a while i have some business ive got to clear up  here as well  mary can i introduce myself lady kima i dont think weve ever met before have we  matt this is true actually no and she steps up to you and you you know at first view youve  had you see shes squareshouldered and pretty rough in the physicality of what youd 
none	 imagine  from most halflings you see she walks with her shoulders forward and she has this intensity to  her step even when its just a friendly exchange she bears armor that is gold with various silver  and blue details on it that are parts of the presentation of bahamut and the temple that is a  representation of his worship she carries a large metallic hammer that she keeps left over  one shoulder she has justpasthershoulders wavy ashy dirtyblondish hair and a big scar that  rides across her face as well as a number of 
dung	 other scars that arent quite as visible she grins as  she steps up and moves her hammer to the other side of her shoulders with a clink and puts her  hand out  mary i put mine out as well and say your appearance fascinates me on so many levels i look  forward to getting to know you  matt she pulls her hand away and she goes interesting coming from you definitely  mary yeah  matt all right  will i dont think we met either how you doing  matt anyway  mary thats 
none	 kash a man of few words  matt ive met few as unremarkable as you in my travels  will im sorry i wasnt listening what  matt touché well ill get about my business here you said youre traveling for half a day to  a day say meet back at the slayers take in about 24 36 hours then head on to the east  liam are we assuming its going to be as easy as all that  laura so wait a couple days and then were heading out i thought we were heading out now  
none	 matt or meet up with you im going by what youre telling me we can meet up whenever youd like  laura are you coming with us  matt im coming with you yeah but i have some business to take care of here in the city before  we go ahead and head off  laura well can we wait a day  liam to have kima with us i think so yes  matt well you guys are going where  mary we were going to head to the loch  laura to the loch  will what 
none	 do you have to do in vasselheim first  travis oh good question  matt she crosses her hands for a second and says why are you so interested in my business  human  will well because if youre coming with us then we have to wait so what youre deciding to do  very much affects what were doing so let me ask it a different way what business do you have in  vasselheim  sam he just raised his voice a little that was the difference  taliesin i didnt catch that  matt i was 
none	 trying to arrange passage to the east got a little bit of pull here in the city  some favors thatre owed to me i figured maybe i could do a favor but thats i dont know if  youre going to have an attitude about it  will well then were in trouble i have an attitude about everything  mary pay him no mind its not personal kash  will what im just its a logical question see shes got something to do in vasselheim we  have to wait what does she have to do i dont 
none	 feel like im talking out of turn  mary making friends as always  marisha to be fair kima and i had a rough start too shes i mean i love you kima but i mean  sometimes you can get a little bit of theres  matt are we meeting back in a couple days or are we waiting whats the business here i  marisha yeah  liam how long do you need to get what you have done you need a day  matt im assuming a day i have to try and find a couple of 
none	 folks and pull some strings  sam do you need me to stay with you to help you  matt no im fine ive seen plenty of your strengths in the past  sam and nipples  laura okay  will were missing something i dont understand  laura i feel like were missing something wait youre trying to get us passage to the back  mary youre trying to get us passage to the knuckles place is that get them passage  laura or are you trying to get us to the lake im so confused this is out 
none	 of character i  literally dont have an idea whats going on  travis i want to insight check kima  laughter  liam little rusty after three weeks folks  matt part of you coming and asking for the aid of the palace was to help with this whole scourge  of dragons youre talking about to the east the ones that you say have destroyed most of westruun  and most of my friends still exist in that area so i figure thats the passage we need to get  over there  marisha when you mean east 
none	 you mean like far east  matt eeeeast  marisha like really okay well no theres time  laura heres the thing also our lady keyleth the beautiful princess that lives among us she  has a way she can travel us very very quickly through trees so we dont actually need passage  matt through trees  marisha its a new skill ive picked up since we hung out last  matt thats weird  travis no its really quite painless its pretty cool  marisha its yeah and it has a nice cedar scent when you go through 
none	  laura so unless were getting supplies and we need to travel with a lot of things then you  know we dont actually need passage  marisha also i need to go by the fire ashari before we really head easteast and theyre west  so  will yeah theres like 37 things we have to do before so  liam we need to carve out a plan kash is right we should pick something shortterm and do  something because  taliesin lets head to the loch  marisha the loch is on the way to the fire 
none	 ashari anyway  laura do you think that this is going to lead to some serious fighting because it sounds like  these vestiges are wellguarded  travis well you dont have any reason to think that could be hanging from a tree branch  laura im sure you know what grog thats an excellent point  travis yeah just hiding in plain sight  laura hanging on a tree branch under the lake  travis thats where id hide it  marisha z kash you all have been by the loch before would you know what  will it 
none	 was pretty unremarkable last time we were there if its the one im thinking of  mary actually i may have remembered something about the loch what do i would i have remembered  anything at all  matt make a history check  mary what do i do for that  laura roll a 20 and add it to your history so 11  mary 11 is that an eight  matt its a pretty unremarkable loch  mary its a pretty unremarkable loch  matt as far as lakes go its maybe a few hundred feet across its 
none	 more from a part of the land  mass actually having a large sinkhole and where certain things may have existed and there are  bits of ruin throughout the surroundings of some sort of a structure that existed there but most  of it seems to have been swallowed up by the ground and the lake has formed in its place  though this was quite some time ago and it swells or drains based on how much snowfall there has  been in recent seasons and its been a pretty heavy winter for you guys so you imagine 
none	 from the  times youve seen it that its been pretty high if not frozen over at times  mary so its rather unremarkable but i think its something that we can handle definitely  within a 24hour period  laura well we just loaded up on a bunch of potions some dickhead  marisha i am with vex though i have a feeling that the chance that this item has been completely  forgotten is not likely  liam well we need allies and we need power because were not in shape to take care of a coven  
dung	 of dragons at the moment seems like slightly lowerhanging fruit than the other option  marisha and laura lets try it  sam what time of day is it right now  matt at this time its probably say midafternoon  laura well were not going to get there before dark so maybe we should sleep here tonight and  start out in the morning  travis well i have a question and not like i can really help with this but should we go see if  we can read about some article of shadowdeath whatever the fuck its 
none	 called like is it in a  library  laura maybe the slayers take knows more about the lake about these vest no these are pretty  secret i think the vestiges are a pretty wellkept secret people arent going to just know  where they are  travis no like what if theyre superold but they go by a different name or something  laura i wonder if somebody knows about a cavern under the lake  taliesin thats what i would assume is there must be some sort of underground structure some  part of the ruins  
none	 laura or maybe we need to breathe underfrickingwater  travis oh ive got two vials of that shit  marisha why dont we take the rest of the night to try and do some research is there any way we  can find maybe maps or something about ancient history books  mary and i do have a map from the slayers take that i could  marisha oh no but i mean we need to find like books about civilizations that mightve been here  in the past that might get us some sort of like a library is 
none	 there a library  travis pictures or no pictures  marisha there might be some pictures  travis all right im in  laura is there a library nearby  matt laughs oh its been two weeks and i missed you guys  will do we have a library at the take  matt hm there are a collection of books at the take but most of them are in reference to  cataloging various creatures details about their lifestyles their inherent weaknesses what  elements of their bodies can be harvested and what clients are usually looking for its 
none	 more  specific to the business of the slayers take than anything that would involve local history i mean  ill say if two of you would like to make an investigation check between the two your choice  whoever wants to do that well base see what information you can find  sam i feel good about my investigation i have a keen eye  laura ive got a pretty decent investigation you and me brother  sam lets do this  laura all right 23  sam not as good but pretty good 17  matt 17 in 
town	 taking the better part of the rest of the day and asking around you manage to find one  location that carries books and what you would consider as sort of like a library though nothing  of the ancient historical fashion there are many books about the history of the temples here in the  town elements of the battles of old but theyre all very vague in their writing as almost like a  story as opposed to a historical factgatheringtype presentation you manage to  find a place that does deal in dusty books partially repaired and 
none	 restored books a little  bit pricier but there is one tome that seems to talk specifically about the history of the raven  queens rise here in the city and if you would like to possibly take this book for a price that  is up to you  laura is somebody watching me at the moment  sam have i rejoined her  matt no you guys are doing this separately  laura are we just perusing a bookstore or  matt essentially right now you are its a small place but there are two employees and its 
none	 not  very busy at all youre the only person in the room so theyre both just quietly watching from a  distance  laura i sit down on the ground and start reading through the book  sam barnes and noblestyle  laura and see if i can find information  matt well about 30 seconds into that one of the employees comes up and goes excuse me miss  laura oh hi  matt if you are going to  laura i keep reading  matt i would ask if you would wish to read this to purchase 
none	 it as that is our business we are  not an open place to just utilize the information  laura oh i thought this was a library  matt its a book sale collection please if youre going to read it please purchase the book  or leave  laura of course well can i just check and make sure that its actually got any information that i  need because if it doesnt then i dont want to buy it you understand  matt you may peruse for but a moment if you do not find an essence of 
none	 what youre seeking at that  time i would have to ask you to leave  laura all right of course yes are you just going to stand there and watch me peruse then  matt yes  laura well i just start looking for what i need  matt in the brief time that you have going through you manage to glean there is a chapter  that speaks of the divergence it speaks of the last large struggle that happened in the center of  civilization this was the second battle before the gods themselves fully rescinded from 
none	 the land  itself and the raven queen did have a number of chosen champions as a part of this endeavor and  thats as far as you get before he goes all right so youve had a bit of time  laura i just dont know i cant really tell if it actually has anything interesting  matt there is a tag on the book that says 30 gold  laura whats the back thats 30 gold 30 gold its so dusty though i mean is that even worth  it if its this dusty 30 gold does it 
none	 have spells in it no  matt he reaches out and grabs the book and says if you are not a serious collector im sorry  then it seems that we  laura oh oh  matt and he starts pulling it tugging it up  laura no i hold onto it well i know people that you know care about dirty old books so i  guess i mean i might be willing to purchase it for them but they usually like things in mint  condition when they buy their antiques this has a damaged spine i see 
none	 it and yellowing of the  pages and it seems like somebodys bookmarked this one  sam it wasnt kept in its neoprene sleeve  matt he slams the book shut as youre perusing through the pages 30 gold or i will ask you to  leave  laura oh this is the worst haggling ever  sam get out your buyers guide  laura whats your name  groaning  sam just kill him  matt make a persuasion check  liam oh good grief  laura 18  taliesin we have robbed cadavers  matt as far as 
none	 youre concerned right now my name is no sale and pulls the book back  laura i feel hurt and i pull out 30 gold and i say i suppose weakly ill buy it  matt takes the gold hands you the tome  laura damn it it hurts it hurts me in my soul  marisha thats the first time ive ever seen vex pay full price for anything  mary is that the first time youve ever paid full price for anything  laura it is actually the first time  mary momentous occasion hunters mark that son 
none	 of a bitch  laura i kind of respect you im a little impressed  matt benjamin cole should you find your way around here again and wish to pay full price for  another one of our fine books  laura benjamin cole youre a dear  matt come again he says begrudgingly as you exit the facility so looking through the book  it does talk about specifically there are a few champions many that were lost entirely to the  battle unrecovered one of the highest of the order of the raven queen that fought in her 
none	 name  was named purvan  laura cackles yeah he was  marisha perv on  matt purvan purvan  sam last name pedobear  laughter  taliesin were running out of good names arent we weve finally gotten to the end of your list  of good names  travis giggling purvan pedobear  matt oh you guys are cruising to a tpk today  laughter  laura not on the anniversary matt not on the anniversary  matt no this is great  travis giggling purvan pedobear  mary kash and z were left staring at the bodies 
none	  matt with great emphasis purvan  liam yes yes get your perv on emphatically  matt all right thats more hit points onto these guys here for later all right  mary perv on macduff perv on  matt purvan suul is the full name though the name was given to the raven queen at the time of  signing itself to the order in which they become nameless the champions are just mentioned or  spoken of in public as the champion so the name is part of the gift they give to the raven queen  when 
none	 they swear themselves to her fell in the final conflict and was interred within a tomb to  the west of vasselheim it is said that it is a multileveled tomb and as the raven queens  fellowship began to fall out of favor after the divergence had happened essentially because her  realm is death during times of great conflict and strife there is great power and a lot of energy  given towards the raven queen when things fall into peace time or at least for an extended  period of time there isnt a lot of conflict 
none	 or burgeoning death and destruction within the  vicinity her worship tends to dwindle as that dwindled there wasnt enough people within the  remaining bloodlines to maintain the tomb it fell into disuse and since then has not been tended to  travis yeah nobodys there  laura theres definitely going to be ghosts there kashaw  will yeah  laura do your holy shit when we go there all right  will i will absolutely do my holy shit you dont want to see the god but well do the rest of the  holy shit well be 
none	 fine  laura oh really is it not like sarenrae sarenrae is that your god  will no  travis no hes married remember  laura youre married to a god wait youre married and you  marisha wait we didnt have that conversation with her  will yeah we didnt for the record she married me and theres a difference  sam youre married  will technically  marisha i dont know if that holds up in court vesh  will shes not really going to care about court so much as ripping the bones from your back you 
none	  really dont want to meet her its a bad thing but yes we can do a whole lot of stuff to get  through the ghosts  laura good times  will well just stay away from her they werent good times  laura i want to hear more about this  will you really dont you wont sleep  travis so we also need maps right we need your maps  mary yes ive got maps  travis wait dont you have something for me also  mary yes i do oh yes i do actually i forgot 
tavern	 i did keep it with me as drunk as i was  i do remember telling you about the moon hammer so i did i brought it and i give this to you my  friend im very excited  travis how big is it i know im looking at it but what does it look like  matt you go ahead and explain  mary no go right ahead  matt it is a fine smooth dark metal warhammer that as the handle itself leads towards the heavy head  portion of the hammer the metal turns instead to 
none	 almost a glistening ivory that has symbols pushed  into it a language you dont understand but theres a giant moon crescent carved into each  side of the hammers head  travis whoa  mary it took me weeks to forge it  travis this is beautiful can i hit something with it  mary sure  travis what can i hit with it  mary scanlan where are you  travis scanlan come here  sam whats up what do you need  travis just stand right there  sam sure whatever you need  travis i reach 
none	 back halfway and give a quartermeasure whoomp right into scanlan  matt make an attack roll well say with disadvantage because you were taking a  halfmeasure  travis about the same as the firebrandish  matt its technically nonmagical  travis okay 14  matt 14 you manage to just barely as you see this thing coming towards you and duck beneath it  sam i thought you were going to tell me a dirty joke or something when you say come here  usually thats what that means  travis no i wanted to try out the hammer 
none	  sam oh well then no try it on vax  liam im already 20 paces away  travis vax  liam i go stealth  matt roll stealth roll a perception check  travis vax shit  liam 27  travis two  laughter  matt try as you might to look around vax is nowhere to be seen  liam i literally just pivoted around my sister and pressed against her  travis doing exactly what she does  sam im going to use minor illusion to make a really shitty vax a really cruddylooking vax  laura 
none	 not in vasselheim  sam oh shit too late  matt too late so as youre looking around you see this strange quiver of shadow that seems to  formulate in the air and this awkward still unmoving awkward mannequintype visual recreation  of vax muddles itself there i need you to roll an insight check  mary laughs please be low  travis it is four  laughter  matt finally vax cannot evade your vision this time grog  travis you stand right there i swing down in an arc to try and hit vax  matt okay 
none	 with this weird awkward halfgrin frozen in place the hammer streaks down through  this form and passes completely through it slamming into the mud beneath splattering mud up  and around you across your chest and for a brief instant vax completely seems to have evaded the  attack  travis yelps i killed him hes all over me his bits are all over me  laura grog how could you my brother  travis what did you give me  mary its a hell of a hammer isnt it  matt with that the illusion is dissipated and 
none	 vax is no longer there before you  travis screams weakly ive killed him ive killed poor vax  mary come here darling  travis what is this evil monstrosity  mary no come here i lead him around the side of vex  liam hey big guy  travis youre alive come here and give him a big ol squeeze and i squeeze a little tighter to  make sure he doesnt turn into mud you turned into mud last time  matt the harder he squeezes you you fear you may turn into mud  travis did it 
none	 hurt did the moon hammer hurt you  liam no no i was able to dodge both ways apart and then came back together its my cloak does that  travis shit this is like were going to save this for the really nasty fellas all right im  going to put this in the bag  mary all right  travis you know if a kid or scanlan or pike sees it shell be so furious  mary yeah shell be terrified  travis i put it in the bag of holding  matt all right at this point 
none	 kima has pulled a small flask out and takes a swig and goes sighs  ah ive missed you  will can you give me a swig of that come on  laura best friends forever gasps  travis grunts splutters respect  will fair enough  matt so are we resting or are we off im growing impatient  travis and laura were off  laura were going to go were going to camp overnight yeah  will sounds perfectly safe  laura you know what  taliesin it doesnt matter if its going to be daylight if were 
none	 underground  laura thats true all right i just think outside of vasselheim you know things come out  at night but whatever  will weve killed a lot of them  mary yeah we have  laura if you guys think this is the most brilliant decision im on board  taliesin im actually hoping that its the worst decision we make because then everythings  uphill  laura so much wisdom  taliesin thank you im just trying to bring  travis lets do it were out  mary having passed the loch before would we have an 
none	 idea of what we might anticipate on the way  matt there are all sorts of things that you could anticipate along the way there are a number of  denizens of this forest that are all sorts of levels of danger there are roving orcish bands  from the far far northwest which you encountered on your way to rimefang there are a number of  other creatures that wander these areas some of them bestial some with some element of culture  there are bandits that come from the far west possibly from across that sea that occasionally 
none	 try and  kill and pillage as best they can most everyone avoids the city of vasselheim because that place  is pretty hardcore by comparison so yeah all kinds of things you could find  mary then i think we should go we can handle it yeah im ready  laura keyleth cant you turn us all to mist and then we poof there  marisha i was going to say do you want to mist walk this it would be appropriate this time  laura then we could be there before the evening  travis can we control 
none	 the direction that we move  marisha yes  laura can you mist walk us all including trinket  liam context is everything  taliesin better doublecheck that  marisha let me see how many people i can do  travis how far away is it ish  matt at a fast pace on foot it would take you seven to eight hours  mary i know a place where we can get horses as well  laura horses would die out there  mary thats all right theyve died before  might need food as well  matt you 
none	 guys have a great history of  sam killing horses  liam i say we let keyleth handle it we swish out and camp for the night  sam lets go just do it  matt up to ten willing creatures for wind walk  laura yay lets do it  matt all right  mary and laura ghost noises  mary were like a giant fart  matt for some of you its a familiar if still uncomfortable physical feeling as your body  marisha just accept it  will whats happening  marisha just accept it  matt 
none	 you become this amorphous cloudy vaporous form you can fly at a very swift speed even  against a relatively strong wind  laura we probably should have talked out our plan before we did this  matt trinket in his mist form is seemingly very uncomfortable with this  circumstance  mary i use beast speech are you all right are you all right trinket everything okay i can  speak to him  matt whats happening  mary its all right darling were going to a loch its going to be great fishing for you  matt i 
none	 will follow  laura we can talk in mist form  matt sure  laughter  matt at this point i dont give a shit  will your fun is wrong your fun is wrong  mary your fun is wrong  travis the tshirt exists  mary it does thanks  matt i can imagine as part of the enchantment as you guys can pass wind through your mist vocal cords  mary just about everything hes very good at passing wind  matt oh hes delightful  travis you really should just chain up with me and ill 
none	 get us there super quick  matt all right so you guys begin to head westward following your previous experience at  the direction that it takes you you push that way kima is also still getting used to this whole  mist form endeavor it takes a little bit for you guys to adjust to this locomotion but it is very  swift in comparison to moving on foot drifting over the top of the forest canopies you guys  riding the top in this fullon falcor flythrough moment as youre cruising through the snowcapped  forest  travis 
none	 like et  laura thats awesome  matt you can see a cluster of large eagles in the distance you guys manage to swoop around  eventually as the sun begins to make its way towards the horizon you managed to cut a good  four or five hours off your journey on this making your way towards the marrowglade loch  there are certain areas where the canopy itself breaks apart and you can see ravines you can see  where areas of the topography have cracked or shifted in time and there are drops that go deep  
none	 under the earth though you cannot quite see where they would continue to go until you make your way  to the marrowglade and there you can see still full to the top if a little icy at the surface  it seems relatively undisturbed you make your way all drifting down back beneath the canopy of  the vesper timberland and at the edges of the lake  mary are there any islands in the loch are there any islands or any sort of rocks or outcroppings  or anything within the loch itself  matt no actually its 
none	 a pretty solid surface and as you guys have drifted down in your form  looking at it you can see that there is a layer of ice youre not quite sure how thick but the  surface is very crystalline  taliesin any remnants of ruins around the loch  matt make a perception check  laura from above could i see any sort of caverns or openings in the ground or something that  looked like caves thats what i was keeping my eye out for as we went  matt make a perception check for you as 
none	 well  taliesin 25  matt 25 you see there are bits of stone scattered about 30 feet out from the lakes edge  going to inspect them and looking about them there are pieces of fallen walls and what appear  to be elements of the tomb possibly before it fell within but you do not see any sort of  opening or entrance its just a part of some structure some foundation that was left behind  will are there any runes or any markings of any kind  matt make an investigation check  laura 22 is 
none	 what i rolled  matt 22 nothing near the loch the largest chasm or portion of land that you saw that was broken  and receded into the earth itself was probably about a halfmile to a mile back nothing that is  in the immediate vicinity of this lake  laura okay is this technically are we in the woods is this my favored terrain again  matt yes you guys have come down into the forest youre all still in mist form so youre  unable to directly interact with anything in the area  will 11  
none	 matt 11 doesnt seem to have any specific elements or markings  mary can i try as well because i can read any writing that we find may i make a check as well  matt make an investigation check sure  mary oh thats terrible never mind  matt so you guys all rest around the outskirts of this lake  laura how do we stop being like this  marisha just think about it think about being a person again  travis how high are we  matt as high as you want to be right now everyone 
none	 has come down to the edge of the lake so  youre right off the ground  laura should we turn like people again  marisha yeah lets turn like people again  laura tell trinket to turn like a bear  will why is everyone talking like this  laura oh can we talk normal oh  mary trinket hon just concentrate on turning back into a bear and youll turn back into a bear  matt okay  laura tell him i love him  mary oh and vex loves you  matt laughs if a bear could 
none	 grin it would however the process is very strange as you see  this misty cloud poof into a bear its about a minute for the full transformation the spell  still maintains its eighthour time period and you can transform back and forth during that  eighthour period  laura killer  matt so well say its been about three to four hours so youre about halfduration all of you  eventually take a minute to revert back to your physical forms and youre all now standing at the  edge of the lake  liam so for the 
none	 next eight hours with a little bit of concentration we can jump back and forth  matt next four hours  liam next four hours we can spend a minute to go foomf and foomf  matt yep you just cant do anything while youre in that form other than move  liam yes i remember  will can you move underwater  laura gasps can we mist underwater can farts travel underwater  marisha i guess if we get trapped underwater we could just concentrate and turn into bubbles  laura thats kind of cool  marisha right that 
none	 would work theoretically  will or well all drown  laura or well drown  mary its a freshwater loch right  travis i dont know i walk up to the edge of the loch and i look in the water what does the water  look like  laura and liam its ice  matt so your head goes boosh a little crack cracking noise  travis its ice  matt as he says that you see a trickle of crimson streaking down the front of his head  laura thank you grog  travis welcome  taliesin im 
none	 going to put some pressure on the ice with my foot is it giving or is it not giving  matt at the place where he put his head or any other place  taliesin no im walking im just testing the ice  matt okay testing it with your foot on the edge it doesnt seem to be any give looking up close  you can see its probably a good inch and a half of ice  laura can i go hit the place where grog hit his head and see if i can crack a hole in 
none	 the ice  matt yeah it takes you a few minutes but you manage to break apart and make a headsized hole  liam and how thick is it based on what she just did  matt its about an inch  liam oh just an inch ooh  laura this is going to suck and i put my head underwater to see if i can look around  matt make a perception check with disadvantage  laura oh shit  mary its good though  laura oh with disadvantage doesnt it count as disadvantage by destroying the rest of 
dung	 my dice  liam yeah  laura perception that is a 31 no 41  liam no 71  matt you see through reality  laura yeah 31  matt giant floating baby right outside of the planet in space  laura what  matt all right so glancing through the murky water beneath the ices surface it is dark and  what little bit of light that would be hitting the surface is refracting through the ice so its  very hard to get a form you can see theres a very thick layer of bottomofthelake  undergrowth various 
none	 underwater plants that have caked the entire floor area of the lake however  you can just see at the edge of your vision before the rest of the light is swallowed by the  water and the murkiness of the depths you can see what looks to be the edge of some sort of stone  structure where two walls would be joined but they break off and crumble and disappear into more  of the undergrowth  laura gasps coughs its down there oh its so cold  liam i take her braid and i start wringing it 
none	 out  laura my poor little feathers are like poo  mary can i use my staff to cast light and shove it down in to see if we can get any light out of  it beneath the ice  matt sure you cast light at the end of your staff it glows and illuminates and as you shove  it down the light disperses beneath the ice  taliesin im going to take my mask and put it on and use the glass to create a clear view into the water  mary should give you some light 
none	 percy  taliesin thank you  matt okay so having to close one eye separately as the light source is literally right in your  face you do look past using the air trapped in the mask a little bit of water is peeking in  because its not perfect you do manage to see beyond that yes there is indeed an element it  looks almost like a slightly tilted peak of some sort of structure that comes to a point and the  top of the point is broken off and crumbled and there are a couple of 
none	 sections of stone that seem  to offshoot at four different points towards the very bottom of the lake itself  laura how deep does it look  matt id say its about 50 to 60 feet deep  taliesin 50 to 60 feet deep  laura oh good good  taliesin give or take  liam do you want to try to cloudcreep our way in there  marisha how far away is it under the ice  taliesin about 30 to 50 feet  marisha lets stand over top of where it is  laura is there any 
none	 way because i have this horrible feeling that were going to get  underwater and then we wont be able to get out because its covered in ice can we melt the ice  can you do something  marisha i was about to do that yeah but i want to go over right above it  taliesin oh thats a perfect idea  marisha yeah so  laura walk carefully  travis are we all going in  laura i feel like we should  sam this is the same day as the monk fight  matt yep  
none	 laura we didnt rest were idiots  travis but we were going to camp when we got here right  matt its about dusk now if you guys are landing  laura lets camp oh god  mary so were going to take a rest what if i  taliesin we can at least start setting up in the meantime  mary so if we rest will it be a long rest overnight  liam yeah were going to camp for the night i dont think we should  sam but our mist form will dissipate so if we want 
none	 to mist it we should mist it now and check  it out  laura im going to try to mist down and just see if i can  liam im going with her  marisha i have water breathing we could do that too  mary or we could polymorph and do something  liam well lets just use the magic you already expended first  matt you pull out your brand new hammer  travis yeah the moon hammer  matt doosh doosh ice shards flying off splashing in the water youre covered in this  icecold water 
none	 now  laura im concentrating on making myself a fart  matt vex turns into a large gaseous form  laura hes doing it too  matt okay the two twins foomf together  liam twin farts  mary id also like to use sculptor of flesh and polymorph myself into a very large alligator  matt all right  mary and go down and check it out  matt all right you guys all three of you descend into the open portion of the lake that  grog has broken through  laura can we go in as gas 
none	  liam can we breathe  matt you guys do its a slog and you can move slowly but the speed thats normally granted to  you by this you actually move slower in this form underwater than you would normally swimming  and as you submerge yourselves you realize even in this form air is required and you start  straining noises  laura i go back up  matt the forms its almost like mist appearing on the edge of the lake that fwoosh forms up  into your two different forms  marisha so pretty  matt 
none	 you however still delve down as your alligator and you swim your way down across the  bottom of the lake  liam percy we did some science that didnt work  taliesin congratulations thats good to know  marisha all right if we rest i can learn water breathing  laura oh killer  sam our good old zahra is already down there looking  laura lets try to set up camp in the trees so were not on the ground  travis yeah like in whitestone  will as theyre setting up camp kash doesnt leave the side 
none	 of the lake hes just watching for  where z went in hes just staring the whole time  matt all right so as you guys are setting up camp in a similar way that you did in whitestone  up within the actual tree canopy itself i need you to make an investigation check  laura any sign of her kash  will nothing yet  mary oh natural 20  cheering  laura oh natural 20  matt as you check around the ruins looking about you can see there appears to be two  different entrances that 
none	 are both completely caved in what you do see though is theres an area of  the bottom of the lake about ten feet away from one of the edges of the temple itself that there  is no undergrowth theres the muddy floor but it appears as if there is no actual plant life that  has grown in this tenfootcircle area  mary can i investigate that area  matt its mud  mary its just mud all right can i get down with my fabulous snout and dig down into the mud a  little bit  
none	 matt okay you take your snout and dig through the mud and bring up some clouds of dirt and  whatever scum has congealed at the bottom of this pond it murks up the water around you your  vision is obscured doesnt seem to be revealing anything per se  mary but i do see an entrance  matt you see what would be an entrance to the structure but the stonework itself has collapsed  in on itself  mary can i see any writing any runes any sign of carvings on the rocks at all  matt 
none	 actually no its pretty plain the exterior is pretty damn plain in presentation  what minor bits of design or grooves that were put into the stone to give it a presentational bump  have eroded over time but beyond that it seems surprisingly plain  mary what the hell would cause no plant life and i can do no more investigating than just that  matt what else would you want to try and do  mary laughing i dont know  matt you are welcome to do whatever you want to do while youre here  laura maybe 
none	 keyleth can find out something  mary all right then ill go back up to the surface and report back what i saw  matt all right  will right when she gets out he throws his cloak over her  mary and i transform back into myself and whack him on the butt as a thanks  laura with your tail  mary with my tail  taliesin thats what tails are for  matt you guys return and you relay what you found to the rest of the group as you guys are  preparing yourselves at this 
dung	 point the sun has set and the night itself is going from red to  dark purple to a proper evening sky anything else you wish to prepare for the evening before you all  find yourselves resting  liam yeah sit on the ground your hairs a mess  i undo the braid and i just  starting over  laura yelps  liam hold still  matt all right anyone else  mary can i go speak to keyleth about what i saw  matt yeah  mary keyleth i saw something strange down there i told everyone 
none	 before but i just dont know what  it is and im not quite sure how to go about finding out whats inside there theres no plant  life whatsoever and you have a connection do you not to plants to trees a much stronger one than  i certainly do i would imagine  marisha i do i could attempt to see what happened what do you mean there was no plant life  mary well i went down there were two entrances and obviously they had crumbled and were no longer  accessible and it seemed like there 
none	 was one more but around it there was pretty substantial plant  life all around coming out from the ground but in about a tenfoot area there was nothing there  and i tried to get down in with my snout but all i did was kick up more silt and i couldnt really  see anything  marisha strange this was at the bottom of the ocean floor  mary of the loch yes  laura and mary the loch  marisha can i do a nature check to see if that sounds like anything familiar and could be 
none	 a  problem  matt sure go ahead and make a nature check  laura did it seem like a perfect circle zahra or was it jaggedy  matt it wasnt mathematically perfect but it was noticeable to be a section of the lake floor that  was glaring to be missing in a large patch  laura how soft was the ground when you dug into it it was softer than the rest of the ground  matt it was very soft  mary i just stuck my snout in it and it kicked up all the mud and 
none	 i couldnt see anything after that  laura sounds to me like a creature that would burrow  marisha its possible 18  matt 18 from what you understand the reasons for something to not grow on the bottom of the  lake would mean that the dirt and the surrounding earth would have to be disturbed enough to where  nothing could take root  will its a lair  laura do i know of any creatures that are underwater  marisha that burrow giant worms  laura is it like the worms that we encountered before  matt 
none	 from what you know and have researched about the worm you discovered previously they tend to  favor more rocky mountainous terrain than underwater there are many creatures that can burrow  marisha are there any underwater serpents  matt plenty of underwater serpents theres all sorts of manner of creatures in this world  laura its possible its a creature thats burrowing or its possible thats an opening into  our underwater cavern and nothing can grow there  marisha it could be a sinkhole it could lead to  will could be a chimney  marisha unlikely but 
none	 it could be a chimney  mary working for the slayers take and having done research on the animals that we have  destroyed for money would there be anything that we would know about serpents or another creature  that might inhabit this loch  matt serpents in lakes nothing that would be monumental beyond actual water serpents which are  minor inconveniences and just natural creatures anything of this size per se there are all  sorts of entities that it could be but none that would be specific to a lake location necessarily  whether it be 
none	 a subterranean creature that uses it for passage or if theres something that lives in  the lake or is part of the lake living in the water itself nothing comes to mind from your  experience  marisha what time is it  matt its past sunset its now in proper night  marisha let me go take a look real quick  laura youre going underwater now its freezing cold  travis were all going in there anyway  marisha i can do my beast thing ill be fine i jump in and go shark form  liam 
none	 i go to the edge of the loch and watch  will so do i  matt okay so the two of you are waiting at the edge of the loch keyleth jumps off the edge and  in midair forms into this giant shark form that slams into the surface of the cold water through  the opening that grog had already opened  laura shes really attractive now isnt she that shark  liam im with kash man what  laura huh  laughter  matt all right make an investigation check  marisha i cant do nature 
none	 or anything like that  matt are you inspecting the ruin what do you want to do  marisha can i see if the hole is naturalmade or manmade  matt investigation check  marisha damn it  matt theres a difference between your knowledge of nature vs actually having to investigate a  specific detail  marisha 14  matt 14 if youre looking at the area that she was mentioning where the plant life is missing  it doesnt appear to be manmade by any means it just looks to have formed by some perpetual  disturbance of 
none	 the muddy earth in that vicinity  laura sounds like a creature  matt anything else you want to investigate while youre down there  marisha does there appear to be any type of motion or does it look like its going downward  or is it just flat  matt it has some variation to it and theres a portion that appears to have been dug up or at  least there is a slight indentation  marisha let me do a quick lap around the ruins and see if i see anything that jumps out at me  
none	 matt okay make another investigation check about the ruins specifically  marisha oy 11  matt 11 looking about same details that she made out about it you do see there is one other  stone entrance of the partially tilted stone structure looks almost like there was a double  doorway there at one side of it but a series of stones and a portion of the structure have  crumbled in on it and it has blocked the passage  marisha does it look to be a similar downward suction thing going on like the other hole  
none	 laughter  matt looks like a partially collapsed or completely collapsed entrance to this structure  marisha okay  will downward suction thing  laughter  marisha thats the scientific term  matt csi vasselheim  laughter  marisha i bounce out  matt okay the shark boosh out of the water catches you off for a second almost jawsride style  marisha three point landing hi guys  liam fin fin  marisha yeah fin fin land shark  matt there you go keyleth reverts to her normal form  marisha im with zahra seems like something scary is 
none	 probably burrowing down there well  probably just have to avoid it tomorrow  mary there are no other entrances that could be the entrance  taliesin we can unblock some of the blocked entrances thats what were going to have to do  is unblock the blocked entrance  liam its going to be a big day tomorrow we should probably get some sleep  mary when i went around the ruins did i notice how large the stones were that had fallen in for  the blocked entrance  matt they varied in size because it was part 
none	 of the wall that had fallen in on itself so there  are sections that are three three and a half feet in diameter and there are also a number of  smaller headsized rocks and chunks that had all filled in this space a lot of the general soot  and mud that had gathered as part of the lakes creation had filled in and covered elements of it  and seeped in to form this puckerpoint if you will  laura laughs pucker point  taliesin its getting weird tonight  mary its an anus of the loch 
none	 the loch has an anus  laura we should settle down to sleep  liam scottish accent oh youre going to loch anus are you  mary scottish accent i love loch anus its very muddy very muddy well it is i put my nose in it  all make sounds of dismay  mary i did as a crocodile  matt why are you making it weird  laughter  laura as were settling down to sleep i make sure that trinket is laying between kash and  keyleth always  matt all right  marisha i just snuggle 
none	 up with trinket hey bud  laura yeah trinket keep keyleth warm shes cold she was in the water  matt all right  will hes a big bear  matt hes a very big bear and the moment that you glance over and give a look without even  looking at you you just hear this growls  will okay fair enough  matt all right anything else you wish to prepare for the evening  taliesin im good  matt all right you all find yourselves asleep  all wait wait wait  liam ill take first watch 
none	  laughter  will whos watching  liam what are you doing man  mary then they all died in their sleep  laura you need to rest you got beat up  liam we take fucking turns  laura you go to sleep im going to stay up for a little bit because im fine  mary ill stay up with vex  liam all right  taliesin wake me up when youre done with your shift  marisha yeah wake me up whenever  laura we climb up in the tree and keep watch  liam i find 
none	 the only empty spot of fur on trinket left and snuggle into it  matt okay the whole process of getting trinket up into the tree itself is hilarious  laura its difficult  matt its a group effort to a certain extent theres a difference between climbing a tree and  getting up into a tree and then getting into a comfortable place where you can rest and not  destroy the tree its a combination of minor druidic talents to create an element of the trees  growth that would be able to support a weight the size 
none	 of a bear  marisha yeah i grow a basket  matt yeah youve done it before  taliesin a bear basket  laura trinkets very thankful  matt all right the two of you keep watch for the first watch well say for about a fourhour  period okay as the end of your watch progresses i need you both to make a perception check  laura oh shit  mary each of us  matt the two that were taking watch the twins  laura he went to bed i was awake  mary we stayed up  
dung	 will because somethings coming out of loch anus  sam a dark force is coming out of loch anus  laura its okay im good 34  mary six  matt looking off towards the other side of the lake you see under what little bit of moonlight  is peeking through the cloud cover over the area which breaks up every now and then you can see a  few stars glistening and a little of the moon peeks through catches your attention  specifically as the moon is the essence of your patron through your vision you can 
none	 see a handful  of small i say small small from this distance but relatively large trinketsized furry entities  that cluster up to the edge of the lake on the opposite side  laura trinketsized furry entities i cant see if theyre actually bears  matt not at this distance no  laura i cast pass without a trace on everyone around me and i stealth  were already stealthed  travis whats the circumference of the lake  matt the full distance around it id say 250 to 300 feet its not a huge lake  travis its 
none	 a giant pond  will so theyre not that far away then  laura 24  matt theyre about 50 60 feet from you guys right now  mary i have darkvision can i see them  matt darkvision up to a certain distance  mary 60 feet  matt id say best you can look at it youve encountered these in the past and this appears to  be a small group of eveningwandering owlbears that are passing through the vicinity  laura owlbears  mary i can talk to them  liam big angry bastards  sam oh 
none	 well why didnt you just say so  matt they do not appear to notice your presence and are just passing through  laura lets just watch them  mary what are they  sam throw things at them  laura we just sit and enjoy this magical moment of seeing the rare owlbear in person  marisha whispering so majestic  sam quick start eating a tootsie pop  mary one  laura and mary two  all three  laughter  matt mr owls bad but mr turtle was a real dick because hes the one who sent 
none	 the kid to it  knowing full well the owl was going to eat that treat the true villains mr turtle  will what about the education of the kid where hes got to go to animals to learn things oh  forget it  liam half the audience is going yeah and half the audience is going  what the fuck are they talking about  matt you get slightly nervous as the owlbears make their way closer to your edge of the lake  going to where the initial breaking of the ice was set by grog they 
none	 all drink of the icecold water  and then eventually make their way scare on the opposite side of the forest  laura did they leave any feathers behind  matt a couple maybe  laura after they get away i want to climb down and gather the feathers that they left behind  matt you find two owlbear feathers  laura okay  mary we can put them in our hair  laura i want to fletch an arrow owlbear arrows  matt okay what kits do you have with you  laura oh shit really you know those 
none	 ones i have  matt make a dexterity check just a straight dexterity check  laura okay  liam where did you get those thieves tools  laura i have thieves tools because im a thief now  liam where did you get them did you buy them  laura i stole them dude  liam stole them from where when i dont remember that did that happen ingame or did you  make that up  laura matt told me i have thieves tools dick 27 27 dexterity  matt he is asleep talking in his sleep  mary 
none	 voice in my head brother twin  laura shut up  matt you finish out the rest of your watch using the moonlight at your disposal you manage to make  a couple of owlbear arrows with the feathers you found  laura these are special  matt theyre functional theyll do  laura cool  travis theyre fucking feathers  laura shut up im writing two owlbear arrows  matt next watch  liam yeah  taliesin hello  matt all right you guys go to sleep the two of you stay up all right you watch and the 
none	 next  four hours go by unhindered  laura oh i warn them theres owlbears in the area before i go to sleep  liam where what the  will about three hours into their shift can i come and relieve him  liam wait i wanted to talk to him youve got to wait  laughter  will ill wait ill wait  liam percival  taliesin yes  liam de rolo how are you doing a lots going on a lot but it hasnt been that long  taliesin no im pleased for the distraction honestly i feel 
none	 sighs  liam has orthax fully left the building  taliesin i dont hear anything anymore if thats what youre asking  liam it is  taliesin i think i think all im manifesting at this point is scars honestly i feel a little  lost now im really not entirely sure what im doing with myself  liam can i tell you i believe you are a good man  taliesin thank you  liam if you listen to your better angels and theyre within your friends listen to them i  dont want to be pushy im sorry 
none	 but you have a family if you want it  taliesin i know ive been thinking a lot about why were together and what were doing  liam i think we all are yeah  taliesin and the conclusion that ive been coming to so far sighs and pike being the exception to  this rule as shes the exception to so many things is i think were very broken people but i  think together we are far greater than the sum of our parts i like who we are together and i think  thats important  liam 
none	 i agree with that  taliesin and i like the influence that everyone has on each other and this includes perhaps you  taking some strides with yourself sighs  liam how do you mean  taliesin its good to want things its very very good to want things its also very very  good to have things its good to its good to find the things that are important to you and move  towards them im in a place where im realizing that i have to make decisions about whats  important and im a little envious that 
none	 you seem to be ahead of the curve on that  liam i wish i felt that way  taliesin i know  liam well i started talking to you i just im sorry if ive done anything to offend you  taliesin never  liam were a bit of an awkward family but we are trying  taliesin and i apologize for any of the mistakes ive made and honestly any of the mistakes im  likely to make but i am starting to imagine a better version of myself im not quite sure who  that is yet 
none	 but there is a destiny i think for us all together  liam this is all a lot bigger than us individually now  taliesin weve been given mighty deeds to accomplish we will rise or if we fail no one  will ever know chuckles  liam laughs theres comfort in that all right ive said my piece  matt at which point you hear a voice say good im trying to sleep  laughter  matt the clinking of armor as kima rolls over on one of the branches and is facepalming at the  conversation  liam 
none	 you are really fucking cool you know that dont you  matt at this point you hear a distant screech that echoes across the night sky all of you wake  up while not extremely loud it is very noticeable and cuts through the silence as there  is a very still wind tonight  liam even if my sisters waking up i kick her hard in the ass  laura ah fuck you  matt you two make a perception check  sam have we achieved our long rest yet  matt not yet no  liam 22  
none	 taliesin 17  matt okay  laura i have pass without a trace cast on us  matt as you went to sleep you didnt  laura shitballs  laughter  matt as you guys are coming back to consciousness you see a shape thats just cant make out the  actual details of it but it coasts across the distant sky across the clouds and a little bit  of moonlight framing the image  taliesin i pull out bad news and im just going to try and use the scope to trail  matt okay you pick it 
none	 up and what you see in the distance is a very very large bird cresting  across the distance it doesnt appear to be coming in your direction but it just slowly makes  its way just over the opening in the canopy  liam i am of course reminded of the giant roc is it the same shape  matt its pretty damn close it disappears over the opposite side  sam wait is it our guy  marisha he lived  liam after ive kicked her i grab keyleth by the shoulder and i start waking her up 
none	 roc roc roc  marisha does it look like the same one  matt it does you catch it just before it disappears over the distant horizon it arcs away  and then vanishes past  marisha whispering he made it  taliesin its very pretty i dont understand what  laura its the cowroc when we were cows when we saved a roc  taliesin was i i dont think i was there  marisha percy was having you were having an episode and locked yourself in the basement  laura oh shit percy  mary kash its the

none	 i wake up can you guys talk a little quieter some of us are sleeping  will are you going to be able to get her on board with my little plan for her brother  sam i think she just wants her brother to be happy you know  will and thats wonderful how do you come up with your songs by the way  sam oh well you know i think of like a word and then i try to think of a rhyme for it like  kashaw like what could that be that could be pshaw 
none	 you know something like that i dont  know im working on that im working on it  will thats amazing its a skill that ive never had before but i guess as you said when you  really take in the world and can see people and how they feel you can really  write a powerful ballad  sam im a man of the world im welltraveled im cultured  taliesin snorts awake rickshaw rickshaw snores  sam rickshaws a good one let me tell you secret weapon i sleep near percy a lot and he  rhymes 
none	 in his sleep its the strangest thing here ill show you ill show you i havent a  fear in the world  taliesin mutters incomprehensibly  laughter  sam sometimes it takes a while  will i dont i dont understand  sam it takes a while  will okay  taliesin mumbles something rhymes with world  sam see its amazing every time every time  will absolutely incredible  matt as the hours pass  laughter  matt through intense conversation and learning about one another the sky comes to a glow with  the rising sun 
none	  will for the love of god let something attack us  matt the rest of the group finds themselves to consciousness the cold morning air and frozen  bits of earlymorning dew across the grass and growth in the forest  liam hm my ears feel really hot this morning i dont know why that is  taliesin ive been breathing on them  liam what  travis what about the little hole in the lake that we smashed is it still there or did it  freeze over  matt the holes still there but there is a 
none	 very thin layer of what appears to be forming ice that  could be easily cracked  travis i got it ill do that and i go and take my morning wee right on the little hole where its  starting to freeze back over  matt there you go grog has now effectively peed in the marrowglade loch  will kash walks over to also pee and looks down at grog and goes holy god  and just turns and walks  laughter  taliesin and thats canon folks  travis thats the sound of 20000 pens hitting paper 
none	  will for the love of god  matt two weeks folks weve been storing this up all right so whats the plan guys  laura i guess we should breathe underwater and head down right  will can we handle the cold is the question i want to know  marisha that is true how cold is that lake  matt its the surface is nearfreezing by the just general temperature of the morning air  youre liable to get hypothermia if you spend any extended period of time in the water  laura extended period  will can 
none	 we send somebody down to try to find the entrance and get in before the rest of us go down  there and flounder around  laura i can well i have really good perception so i can go down and see if i can  find an opening that you guys didnt see yesterday  liam im going to take a walk around the whole thing and see if i can see anything on the edges  marisha how big you said the lake was like 350 feet  matt its about 350 feet circumference around its not a 
none	 very very large  will i can destroy water but i dont know  marisha i can control water  laura could you like make a you know parting of the red sea sort of thing  marisha i might be able to actually yeah  laura try that  liam did a 22 perception check around the edge of the loch find anything  matt nothing beyond the edge of the lake there isnt i mean you find bits and pieces of broken  stone but nothing that seems to be indicative of a change in topography  taliesin 
none	 i would actually say breathe underwater would be the safer bet in case something happens  if we have to escape we dont want to necessarily rely on your consciousness  sam i can make us all look like fish  laura oh thats good useful that could be useful if something was attacking and they  wouldnt attack fish  taliesin yes theyre like oh look fish im not going to eat that im so bored of it  sam ill workshop that one  liam yeah its good that you have it but just hold onto it for 
none	 a rainy day  marisha i can focus to part the waters for about ten minutes  liam ten minutes thats more than enough time  laura ill run in search around  sam you well all run in  laura well all run in search around like maniacs for ten minutes  liam grog are you ready to dig  travis yeah  marisha and then if we dont find anything then i can still cast breathe water on us  sam how much water can you displace  matt a cube of up to 100 feet on a 
none	 side so you could pretty much part the entire lake  laura lets do it and run down and search  mary in doing so could she get all the water out of the lake so that it would be gone forever or  is it just a temporary parting  laura i feel like thats killing a lot of wildlife  marisha are there a lot of fish in here  matt youve been around there are some fish that live in here  liam lets just get in there lets not destroy the loch  marisha yeah i 
none	 probably cant even get all of it out but let me let me see what i can do  matt so you cast control water  marisha i guess i cast control water  laura keyleth i have total faith in you  marisha thank you  sam go keyleth go  matt as keyleth completes the spell in a rapid series of hand motions concentrating her eyes  illuminate with the power of her druidic divine energies she extends her hands and the water  itself in the center of the lake the ice cracks up almost like a 
none	 fissure is building in the  center its almost like tin foil being folded back from the inside out the ice is actually  breaking and being pulled to the sides and as the ice is pulled back the water is pulled back with  it like someone has torn into the surface of the earth and peeled the ice back like a sheet it  forms this long tunnel that leads directly down into the center of the lake the water is being  held aloft over the surface not actually being cast to the sides out into the 
none	 river you could  empty the lake for the most part if you wanted to do it now but right now youre just holding it  aloft as these two water pillars  taliesin could you build an ice tunnel perhaps take some of the ice and actually structure a  marisha i was going to say actually i think as control water i can also change if it freezes and  if its solid can i freeze the edges of this make an awesome  matt you cannot refreeze water with this spell unfortunately you can just control its 
none	 shape the  temperature is a whole different ballgame  taliesin but there is frozen we could take the existing ice and create  laura you know what im running in and keyleth just be ready to throw it away  marisha im just going to focus and keep pushing it out  laura i run in and start looking for anything  marisha go move fast you have ten minutes  mary i go to the entrance that was blocked and i investigate to see whether or not theres any way  we can climb our way through focus 
none	 on the nonvegetative spots and get in  laura im going to that and seeing if theres something there  matt okay the stonework you can start pulling the stones that block the area that lead into that  one collapsed entrance and yeah you start moving things out of the way and they tumble down to the  bottom and stick into the mud the bottom of the pond is a very interesting sight when its  drained all the plant life is just sucked together and youre all sloshing through youre  up to your knees with each 
none	 step as you just sink into the mud  sam its a super muddy ahnus  marisha i am going to go ahead and start pushing some of the water outwards out of the lake as im  keeping it pushed  laura i go to the hole to the ahnus and start looking  matt looking in there as you begin to step into the mud it is a thicker portion and your feet  begin to sink into it  taliesin you can control water can you control the water in the mud  marisha ive got a 
none	 lot on my mind right now percy  taliesin okay okay i was just throwing it out there  matt to a certain extent you can control elements of it but because the earth itself is  not part of it it does resist the spell effect so it would be very minimal effects as you step  into it you begin to sink  laura oh i just stepped right in because im really smart you guys hold onto me  liam i start pulling  matt make a strength check  liam oh thank god im so strong 
none	 that is im going to use luck and thats shit  laura im going im sinking grog  liam 11 11  matt all right the two twins are now sucking sound being pulled in into this small mire  travis what happened to you two  laura grog help seriously quick  liam remember how happy you were that i was alive thats not going to last much longer  laura come on come on grog help  travis how deep are they  matt shes about up to her waist now  travis nah youre good just swim 
none	  matt up to upper torso vax is now getting to right around upper thigh  travis oh look i mean youre not even twinsies about it youre at different lengths youve got  to even out a bit  will dont struggle or youll sink faster  matt trinkets all concerned grunts  laura i take out my rope of infinite twine and throw it to trinkets mouth from far away  matt chomp grunt  laura pull me out  matt all right and with that trinket begins to back up sucking footsteps cant get traction in  
none	 the mud hes trying to pull but is sliding in space  laura this sucks you guys  taliesin im going to try to grab the rope  laura grog why are you being a dickfuck i need to get out of this mud seriously  taliesin ugh thats a 12  matt theres no movement on this point you guys are trying to pull and theyre not sinking right  at the moment there is tension on the rope but theyre not being pulled out either theyre just  held in place  marisha you all had better be 
none	 making damn good use of this time  laura great use keyleth we found an entrance point ish  sam are we just at the edge of the pond  matt you guys are now in the center of the base of the pond  sam but we havent gotten to the part  matt no you guys are at the base of the stone structure which is not too far from the section  theyre sinking in  liam dying in slow motion over here  matt youve been pulling rocks away from the crumbled entrance which is much 
none	 easier now that  there isnt water pressed against it so youre actually moving rocks out of the way and youre  making some headway into this entrance  mary do i even see them  matt you see out of the corner of your eye them talking and shouting to each other  mary grog come over here darling ive got some rocks you can move maybe we can  get in on this side  laura youre not going to even help cool  mary i cant see you corner of my eye i hear you squabbling you 
none	 guys squabble all the time  travis now what are we moving  laura seriously were dying were going to die  liam we are sinking in the mud over here  matt kima runs up to you guys looks over and goes ah theyre fine and starts grabbing rocks  travis here we go lets move this shit  sam hey guys you want a hand  laura yes please get us out with bigby  sam so i will cast bigbys hand and i will gently lift them up and cup them as i pull them up  
none	 from the muck  matt easy enough to do the giant shimmering arcane hand of bigby scoops both of the twins up  and dislodges them from the muddy surface setting you guys down gently and drifts to your side with  a thumbsup  laughter  taliesin since we have bigbys hand why dont we use it to  sam sure sure sure what do you need me to lift  laura can you scoop out all the mud in that fucking hole that just tried to kill us  sam all right lets scoop were scooping im scooping 
none	  matt are you scooping mud or are you scooping stone i didnt hear which one youre doing  sam i go with zahra what do you want me to scoop zahra  mary oh well did i even hear any of this im still over there with grog moving  travis were moving rocks  mary were moving rocks louder i think were going to move rocks can you give us a hand with  the rocks  sam sure here it comes whee  matt okay laughs ill say the two of you guys make strength checks and 
none	 you go ahead and roll a  d20 and add your charisma no bigbys hand is  travis 20  taliesin wow thats your wisdom modifier holy cow  sam is that good or bad  taliesin thats awful thats amazing ive never seen anything like it  matt yeah plus eight to it  sam 16  matt 16 okay 20 and  mary four  matt four so youre helping  mary im more of a delegator  matt yeah youre the foreman of this exercise but between grog and bigbys hand though large  sections of stone 
none	 are being scooped out and tossed to the side  marisha i start tossing water out of this lake  matt youre hitting the five to sixminute mark its a tenminute duration  youre a little past halfway  marisha seeing that theyre still doing a lot of work im going to start seeing if i can push some  of this water out of the lake a bit  matt okay you push some of the water out of the way some of it is splashing off to the side and  being soaked into the local dirt and 
none	 earth youre still holding about half of the pond itself up at  the sides you guys are beginning to make headway through and you see a lot of the stones here have  been pushed in with suction from the mud and kept a barrier and about three minutes later you  begin to find an opening and you start pulling out a big plug of stone and you can see beyond  that there is an actual stairway and a pitchblack lightless entrance that goes deeper  into this actual structure  taliesin lets go  travis well 
none	 problem stairway but when water comes back in you drown in that stairway so  will well have to block it up behind us  mary once this is done can you cast one of those  marisha maybe i start walking towards them  laura once were in and waters covering it were not going to be able to get these stones away  liam keyleth can you walk down this way while still doing that and scanlan can you use bigbys  hand to block the hole once keyleth is past you  sam for a very small 
none	 amount of time  liam yeah and then keyleth can you make a wall of stone once youve let down the water  marisha yes if we try and go super fast  liam lets do it  mary i can cast light and get us down there  sam okay i can make a wall behind us or something  marisha i go and start heading towards the tunnel and pushing all the water outwards  matt okay so keeping the water at bay now rotating around your movement into the center you  all make your way towards 
none	 that rocky entrance its just big enough to get each of you through  grog and trinket at the very largest you all push your way through climbing in the other side  keyleth concentrating steps inside as the last one as you begin with the last few minutes you have  sam i guess ill just pack it with mud and rocks right  matt just taking it all chunk after chunk after chunk just at the tail end of your concentration  the hand pulls in the last plug as the water crashing water sound comes crashing into 
none	 itself  filling the space as you all are standing there the light of zahras staff lighting the area  theres the impact of water rushing in against the stonework and you can feel the whole place shake  from the impact and immediately water begins to rush in through the cracks of  this created section  laura oh  sam im not a good builder  laughter  liam hold it scanlan hold it for a moment  matt i was going to say based on the push of the water against the rock and bigbys hand against 
none	  that i need you to go ahead and roll a d20 and add eight for bigbys strength to try and hold the  plug in place  sam 24  matt 24 total roll with that impact you can see streams of water pushing through and mud and other  elements filling the gaps of the stonework bigbys hand pushing up against it looks like the  stonework was ready to give and the water begins to go ahead and fill this vicinity the hand  pushes back until the streams that are peeking through turn to a trickle 
none	 and by the time the  spell finally comes to an end the hand vanishes the plugged hole gives a little bit and then  seems to keep itself in place waters still dribbling out and trickling there is still a  gradual bit of moisture passing through here and you dont know how long itll hold but for the  time being it seems to be holding  sam yikes  mary well done scanlan  sam thank you for the idea  liam well we could risk it or keyleth are you able to put up a wall 
none	  taliesin i think we can risk it for now  travis yeah risk it because we have to come back through this way probably  laura thats true if something happens you can put it up  marisha lets head downstairs and we might not need to worry about this in a second  travis hey sneakysneaky go take a look  liam are you talking to her or me  travis no you shitbrain  laura hey you know what were not doing anything for you you fuck cause you didnt even  try to help us  
none	 travis oh look at me digging in a muddy hole that led to nowhere  liam i let them argue and i skulk forward while theyre fighting  natural 20  will see that my mans going to check some stuff out  sam ah you must be so proud  will very excited  matt so as vax vanishes from your sight disappearing into the shadows down the stairway  that leads forward were going to take a quick break  cheering  matt well be right back so get your snacks get your bathroom on well be here

none	 they just cut the power on our show  matt so are you guys all staying at the top of the stairs or are you staying a little bit behind  vaxs movement  liam im 20 feet ahead  laura were moving but we should probably i dont know stealth i dont know what would be  alive down here but there might be undead actually can i take a moment and use primeval  awareness and sense if theres any undead entities around any ghostly or undead zombies  anything undead  liam and i sorry rolled a 
none	 30 for perception  laura aberrations  matt which one are you focusing on i think you have to choose the type  laura lets start with undead  matt undead you take a moment focusing here  laura up to six miles  matt yes as vax pushes forward nothing catches your attention undeadwise there are no undead  entities within the vicinity which you can focus on so thats one thing you  dont got to worry about  laura one thing  will i think because z is in the front with her light kash backs all 
none	 the way up to the back and  lights a light as well  matt all right so the two of you have light from this pitchdark vicinity which is helpful for  those of human descent no undead presence in the vicinity vax pushing down this stairwell it  continues down with a slight curvature almost like a gradual spiral staircase until eventually  it hits a floor area the flooring here is at a tilt from what you can see this whole tomb this  whole ruin when it sank in it sank at a slight angle and 
none	 the surface of all the stonework here  is still slick with water and various liquid that has trickled through over time you get the sense  that there are a number of leaks within this temple and the pond that would grow larger is  steadily slipping into this ruin and then being filled over time from the rainy and snowy weather  as it hits the area  as you hit the bottom and you look around you see ahead immediately across the way as youre the  first in there two small humanoid shapes down this tjunction 
none	 to the right and left of you are  two tunnels and there is one ahead and about 35 to 40 feet ahead of you you see two humanoid  individuals  liam weve already got company i see two small little buggers ahead of me  i dont know what they are  laura i cast pass without a trace on the group  sam can you kill them  liam i dont know yet just wait for a second im going to sit for a minute one minute and see  what they do  laura can we 
dung	 stealth  marisha yeah lets all stealth  matt all right everyone roll stealth are you keeping your light spells up  mary and will no  matt both of you snuff the light spells so you have zero visibility right now  liam i am really wellhidden  mary ive got darkvision  travis i do too  sam so do i  matt stealth checks from everybody  liam i am covered in mud  laura oh thats true we are really camouflaged  liam the twins are dark right now  marisha i rolled a natural one

none	 of you guys roll  perception checks those with darkvision right now  sam oh wait darkvision  mary natural 20 natural 20  will yeah thats your second one  travis 14  matt 14 the two of you can see these entities theyre humanoid bipedal two arms two legs  standing up on their legs however their feet are these webbed clawtype physicality theyre  wearing haphazard leather tunics wrappings around their wrists and theyre hunched forward as  theyre walking away from you deeper into the shadows seemingly completely unnoticing of your  presence their heads are 
none	 these bowedforward fishtype visions you can see they have these  bulbous eyes at the edges jagged toothy mouths that end at this small point to the end very  very fishlike amphibioustype entities they both scuffle alongside each other and shuffle into  the darkness beyond down that further hallway  liam theyre walking in pitch black right  matt yes  mary we have tunnels left and right  matt left and right and in front where they both disappeared  mary we dont hear them speaking we dont hear them doing anything  matt no theyre just 
none	 walking  marisha do they look to be on patrol are they walking back and forth  matt theyre just walking they havent turned back  will are they armed  matt yes you can see both of them have what looks to be a cluster of ropes to one side  hanging off their belt and have spears that theyre clutching and walking along  mary are the ropes attached to the spears  matt no  mary do they have eyeballs  matt they do  mary what color are they im sorry  matt theres no color 
dung	 in darkvision its black and white  travis everyone listen up theres two of them and theyre walking away from us down a hall they  dont see us yet  mary they appear to be some sort of fishlike creature theyve got spears and ropes  laura you know what i bet if they live in the dark light will blind them  mary you know youre very smart  liam are we all huddled together at this point  matt theyve all gathered down to the bottom  liam they came up behind me right yeah so youre 
none	 talking into your ear to me  laura guess what  liam what whats going on  laura theres fish people up ahead  liam it sounded like that but i cant see shit down here zahra you were able to see  marisha i poke my head in between the twins and i go do you guys have an earache does your ear hurt  laura can you see us we cant see anything  liam you cant see shit either  laura should we get some light  mary should we theres a tunnel to the left and 
none	 theres a tunnel to the right  liam i pull out my flametongue dagger and make dim light  matt okay so as the dagger gives off a bit of flame those of you with lowlight vision have  extended visual at this point at this point too as youre adjusting to the atmosphere here there  is this very heavy smell of mold and mildew throughout this entire area and looking down you  can see the bit of light dances across the stone floor that has water trickling across it and  leading to one side to the 
none	 left with the tilt of the floor what do you wish to do  liam well we can follow the fish brothers or we could check out these two tunnels  travis i like that  laura i have a question in my book that i bought for 30 gold did it mention what level of the  multilevel tomb the champion was buried on  matt no there wasnt much detail about the tombs actual build it spoke more of the history  of the man who was buried there and gave reference to the direction you were traveling 
none	 to just to  reaffirm you were going in the right way  liam you got played  laura i got played it was a worthless 30 gold then  matt no you learned information about the history of the man whos buried here its not  like every stone structure of ancient history has a book of blueprints available at your local  7eleven  will that was 60 gold  matt yeah thats a little more expensive  mary all right grog since you and i have darkvision is it still did you cast light  matt no 
none	 you can see vax is holding out his flame dagger it has a little bit of fire trickling off  it its eversogently lighting the very local area  mary id like to investigate the tunnel to the left  travis and ill look at the one on the right  matt to the left you go to the one on the right  travis i tell vax to stay on my six as i go up  will and i follow z  matt okay so we have grog and vex are heading to the right  laura vax 
none	  matt sorry grog and vax are heading to the right and zahra and kash are going to the left  anyone else everyone else staying in the center  taliesin staying center  marisha ill stay center with percy  sam im going to go with zahra  mary ive noticed that you all have some sort of earpiece do you have any extra  sam no but im going to go with you so ill be able to report  will oh great  matt okay two of you stay behind  sam kash are you sure you 
none	 dont want to go with vax  will no im good thank you  sam all right  matt all right so grog and vax you guys traverse to the right with what little light hes  giving off the dagger it continues for about 15 feet before it curves sharply to the right roll a  perception check grog  travis i have that darkvision too thats not bad 17  matt 17 you turn the corner and manage to stop yourself just as your feet meet the edge of where  the stone flooring has dropped out the 
none	 tunnel itself here just seems to have ended and there is  a chasm that disappears beneath your visual range a couple of stones cracking noise crumble  travis stop stop stop stop get back back up  matt you hear them after a number of seconds eventually hit with a slight splash of water  liam what is it  travis i just think you should go in front of me here is all  liam you think i should go you want me to scout ahead  travis yeah it looks a little slick but just go ahead 
none	 just real careful  liam all right i walk past  travis no im kidding jesus it falls off into eternity its instant death  liam what the fuck is wrong with you  laughter  travis what you cant see  liam i really cant get a bead on you  laura can you guys keep it down i can hear you from here  travis i grab my earring and i say im on the right it is a dead end all the way  mary can you see down the hole  laura is it a dead 
none	 end so its a wall in front of you  liam i grasp his giant fucking forearm and lean out with the dagger and how far can i see with  this dim light  matt you can see that this collapsed portion goes for about 20 25 feet and then the path continues  beyond that for about another 20 25 feet and then comes to a halt at the opposite side  liam so theres a big gap and then theres more path further  travis yeah its like 20 feet does anybody climb on anything  laura 
none	 do you see any openings down there  liam youre not here you dont even know what were doing  laura shit  travis cant you climb on shit  liam i can but lets see what the others find on their end and then well figure out if we want to  deal with this  travis all right hey scanlan  sam oi  travis what did you and zahra find  sam well  matt so as you guys continue down the other way  laughter  will meanwhile  mary back at the ranch  matt 
none	 you guys step down this surface and the water is pouring down this way and as you step  theres this squishing sound not from the water but there is every ten or so feet theres a  patch of very thick mucusy slime that seems to cover portions of the wall and portions of the  floor you slip a little bit and catch yourself and there is a residue that you have to slough off  your boots  will this is never going to be good  matt eventually the tilted tunnel comes to a very tight 
none	 spiral staircase that descends further down  mary scanlan tell them i can see some sort of spiral staircase but there seems to be a lot of  goo here and im always wary of goo  sam goo is rarely good we should continue on to find out  mary i agree should we do we check in with the others and see  will what are you holding your ear for  sam this is something we all do i dont know why we dont need to do this its just a thing  travis its like professor 
none	 x  sam you know what im going to try it without it might feel weird louder grog can you hear  me grog can you hear me  travis oh now i can hear you  sam see it doesnt work that way  laughter  sam grog theres a spiral staircase and some snot so were going to keep going  laura wait wait youre going down into the snotty  sam talking to grog  taliesin lets all go down into the spiral staircase  liam i heard it as well we dont want to split up 
none	 wait there for a minute  marisha is there any mosssnot near percy and i in the middle of the hall  matt looking about your general vicinity very quickly at your foot yeah theres some  marisha can i do a check a snot check  matt make a nature check  marisha that one failed me  will i blame the dice  marisha get out of here lets do the wood one oh thats good 29  matt taking the slickness of it you were expecting some sort of secretion and there is no  acridness to 
none	 it there is nothing about it that seems to jump out at you as a natural creation by  a creature youre not quite sure what the source of it could be it could be somehow over time  slickness that came in through the water or some other source you really in your experience as a  druid have no clear idea as to where this may have come from  marisha so its not from a creature but it is natural  matt it doesnt appear to be natural the viscousness doesnt match anything youve  encountered from 
none	 nature so youre not sure what the source is it doesnt appear to be like a  large snail or something like that the only reason you would know that is from your experience  with subterranean creatures and studying that in your books and as you go through what youve  researched nothing jumps out at you  taliesin youve milked a lot of snails and youve never seen anything like this  will laughs this is the strangest snail milk ive ever seen  mary does it have any aroma  matt no actually no aroma whatsoever it 
none	 is relatively featureless other than  its viscous texture  sam im going to pull a grog and taste it  marisha you said theres no acridness  matt okay i need you guys to both no im kidding  laughter  matt flavorless  marisha hey guys i dont trust this goo it creeps me out just be careful  liam on our end theres a big chasm over here and there is a path on the other side of it but  wed have to get over the chasm  marisha i mean we can manage that if 
none	 you think its not a dead end  liam but youve got a complete stairway over there with boogers on it  taliesin i think we want to head down down is the way to go  matt theyve gone beyond your vision you dont see them the path just continues on in the  direction they were walking they have not noticed you and have not seemingly returned yet  travis like a sentry i just keep looking that way  mary i think we should go down  will what do you think about a little bit of 
dung	 light  mary i can still see in the dark for a little while lets not alert anything of our presence  matt the two of you are fumbling in complete darkness right now  laura its really fucking dark  mary when you cast light do you get to control the amount of light or is it just  matt sure i dont see why not  mary all right ill cast light and keep my staff behind me a faint candlelight as i continue to  use my darkvision  matt so do you guys return with the 
none	 rest of the group and the group continues down the spiral  staircase  laura i want to keep an eye out for any traps or anything  marisha i keep an eye on the goo  travis ill stay in the very back and leaving the dust of tracelessness  matt at this point trinket finally comes down the rest of the staircase staying back from the  rest of the group being stealthy  mary trinket have you ever experienced anything like this do you know anything about this gooey shite  matt trinket is actually far behind 
none	 youd have to back up to converse  mary all right never mind  matt you guys have quite a large group here especially with kima involved you have quite the  party this is going to be very interesting to see how it  sam were all in the same tunnel now  matt you guys are all making your way down the left tunnel down the spiral staircase that zahra  found so you progress downward youre looking for  liam traps im looking for traps  matt just keeping an eye out  liam yeah im using 
none	 the light from her thumb or whatever  mary my staff  laura i want to look for any imperfections in the stairs that look like they could collapse at any  time or they could be unsafe  matt both of you guys make perception checks with disadvantage  marisha disadvantage  matt very low light  liam i dont know why i rolled both at the same time 22 for me  laura 28 for me  taliesin thats a disadvantage roll  matt coursing down what catches your eye is a little ways down the spiral staircase 
dung	 there are a  couple of small dark what look like minor objects that stand out against the rest of the  stone structure  laura can i crouch down and look at it and see what it is  matt they appear to be a couple of dark feathers they are beneath an actual layer of slick slime  theyve been there for a while but there are two feathers  laura do they look like the owlbear feathers that i picked up earlier  matt no actually owlbear feathers are textured with some layers of color like a 
none	 natural owltype  entity would have these are jet black you recognize it very quickly  laura hey keyleth have you ever seen feathers like this  marisha do they appear to be raven feathers  matt they are raven feathers yes  laura why were they covered in goo  marisha maybe this was some sort of offering to the raven queen we might be getting close  laura fuck the raven queen right that makes sense  mary well done  laura thank you you guys ravens  marisha ravens yeah onward  matt pressing down the spiral 
none	 staircase it comes to another floor beneath the one you just hailed  from go ahead and make another perception check you guys going forward its the two of you at the front  laura yeah  mary do you need more light you all right  laura oh was i supposed to still be at disadvantage  matt if shes behind you with a very faint bit of candlelight you guys have lowlight vision so  you can still make these checks right now but its at disadvantage because its very very limited  liam 22  laura 26 
none	  will the twins baby  matt all right as you guys push forward you reach out and stop vax before he takes another  step as you notice this pathway now hatchbacking back in the direction you guys had come from on  the lower floor you can see these very very thin about two inch wide slits in the stone walls  to each side of you  liam im going to take a closer look at those things do i need to roll anything if i see them  now because shes pointed them out  matt 
none	 she pointed them out  liam im going to try to disarm them they look like things ive seen before they look like  traps im going to try to disarm them  matt okay go for it  mary i extend my staff and i raise the light just a bit so you can see  laura does it look like traps you want to perceive them  liam what is disarm traps dexterity check  matt this would be using your thieves tools and for this it would be i will make this an  intellect check with 
none	 the tools  liam an intellect check not the thieves tools  matt thieves tools proficiency plus your intelligence modifier  liam plus the intelligence modifier  matt correct because this is you actually have not encountered this type of trap before and  youre trying to ascertain its nature without setting it off  travis i need popcorn for this  liam 23 then  laura wow youre really smart  matt 23  liam yeah  matt as you step forward and begin to try pulling your tools out to inspect the nature of  these looking into 
dung	 the dark paths on each side theres an instantaneous movement like a puff of  air that comes out of each side i need you to roll a dexterity save  liam instinctually i do evasion if its dexterity i rolled a 12 plus 22  matt 22 all right you zoomf just out of the way as these two pendulum blades whoosh right  past you missing you by about a half an inch and then whoosh disappear and then swing back a  second time resetting on opposite sides of the hallway  will we all saw that 
none	 right  matt you all saw that with a very whoosh whoosh  liam scythes in the wall my nose tickles right now im going to attempt to take these out and  hold on  laura can i perceive around and see if i see any switches or anything that would turn them off  matt make an investigation check  liam thieves tools to disarm right  matt based on the check you previously made these are a little more intricate and youre  having a hard time finding a way to disarm them this would be more 
none	 of trying to find a mechanism  in which to disarm them which she is currently doing  laura this wouldnt be underdarky at all would it  matt no  laura then i rolled a ten  matt well this is an investigation check  liam investigation all right  matt ten you have no idea of the nature of these  liam 13  matt from this perspective you have no inkling or idea as to what the mechanism is where its  hidden if there is a way to be able to disable the trigger you have 
none	 not encountered this before  and it is a little beyond your expertise at the moment  liam grog theres giant scythes in the wall or something and i cant figure out how to take it  apart do you have a weapon that you could jam in this fucker like a throwaway weapon that you  dont care about  travis yeah ive got three greatswords that are shit  liam do you want to fucking fuck this knife hole with a sword  sam on vexs suggestion im going to make an investigation check 30  matt so 
none	 while you guys are having this conversation scanlan you step directly up to the  very edge of where these blades swing from  sam kashaw watch this  laughter  mary i think someone has a crush  matt and you notice that just glancing ever so slightly on the inside there is some sort of a  latch that is guarded by the blades embedded portion you realize as you put your hand forward  you trigger some sort of arcane sensor that is part of this that causes the blades to whoosh  swing back and as 
none	 they swing past you you hear a click on the inside of the groove that they swing  from and then as they swing a second time to reset it gives a louder click sound almost like  it resets itself  sam and how long a period from the blade swinging to swinging back like a half a second  matt its about a second its whoosh whoosh  sam so someone needs to reach their little hand in there and click it  laura someone with little gnome hands maybe  will impress me  sam shit  
none	 laughter  sam all right watch this yalls im going to try to do it  taliesin we get two tries each itll be great  laughter  marisha scanlan would you like a little bit of enhancement  sam enhancement  marisha natural enhancement of course  sam ooh i will never say no to enhancement  marisha i reach over and i enhance what are you probably going to be using dexterity  sam i guess a little shortswordy blade i guess to get in there or i have  marisha is this going to be a sleight 
none	 of hand check  sam i have climbing gear i have a cube i have a flute what can fit in there  matt its about two inches wide the gap  laura so its wide enough for your fingers  marisha im going to cast enhance ability and give him cats grace for his dexterity checks  matt okay so you have advantage on dexteritybased ability checks currently  sam come on i need these babies to play  marisha dont lose your hand scanlan we dont have pike to regenerate it right now  sam do you have 
none	 any tools i can borrow  taliesin i have a sword  sam that shitty sword that you dont care about  taliesin its a very nice sword that i care about quite a bit  sam could i shove a blade in there and jam it maybe  matt you can try to  will thats never a good answer laughs you can try  sam im going to use my aberration bane sword shortsword or whatever it is i have never used it  mary muffled dont use that sword what are you thinking  sam all right 
none	 im going to jam it in there  matt are you going to do it  sam sure  matt all right so you reach over and trigger the blades pulling back immediately fwoof they  pass back in that one moment you go for it make a straight dexterity ability check so roll a d20  you have advantage on it  sam okay plus my dexterity which is zero so thats 13  marisha dear god  matt once you understand the nature of this its not a very difficult thing to find you bring the  blade 
none	 around in that brief moment and as you bring your head into view to inspect the inside  you can see there is a slight stone protrusion from within that groove you realize the blade  probably isnt going to help at this point you reach over and just tkch  sam with my finger  matt you hit it with your fingers as you do you look quickly over to your right and the blade is  already pulling back towards the area where your head is and then creak crunch halts and now  the blades are just 
none	 hanging  relieved noises  matt locked in place as the arcane nature of this trap has held them aloft  mary that was hot that was very hot  marisha what was your first roll  sam thank you five  matt laughing that would have been very bad  sam thank you for the advantage keyleth  will that was impressive if it werent for vax youd be my man  sam laughing oh kashaw you sweettalker  laughter  taliesin im in the middle of this  sam dont worry everyone ive cleared the way  laura 
none	 i pat his little head as i walk through the blades not his cube just the top of his head  laughter  matt so as you guys continue forward down this long hallway heading at a slight upward angle  now going against the tilt of this temple whos leading all right pushing forward it continues  for about 60 feet there was a tunnel split over to the right side but that has entirely collapsed  and is just filled with stone and it spills out partially into the hallway but its easy to step  over and 
none	 get past eventually  liam are you saying its not blocked its just some rubble and you can step over it  matt meaning the passage that youre walking down it looks like there was a path that went to  the right that whole thing collapsed inward and is completely impassable  liam its pooped into the passage  matt it has spilled into the passage but its nothing you cant traverse over  liam thank you  will wow you paint with words  matt his vernacular is impressive  liam this is my profession  laughter  
none	 will it pooped into the passage  matt pushing even further forward the passageway begins to curve gradually to the left over about  20 feet and disappearing around a corner as you continue to push forward here you have moved  beyond the light unless zahra are you keeping the same essence of light here to help with his  vision you would have to travel up with him to be able to see around the corner as you move  liam vex could you tell zahra to come up another 20 feet or so  mary coming coming 
none	 now so i go up and i stand next to him  laura walk quietly dear  matt as you continue to move forward with him the light cascading further down the hall  eventually the curvature comes to a halt and you can see before you a tintersection of the tunnel  across the way the tunnel directly across from you comes to a halt it just ends about 20 feet  beyond this intersection there is a path to the right and the left make a perception check  liam 22  matt okay you can see in 
none	 a similar fashion to the tunnel you and grog first discovered the  floor that is the center of this tintersection has completely fallen out as well there are  sections of stone that jut out from the edges but it appears that this intersection for about a ten  by ten foot area of the floor is just completely bottomed out  liam so i had a fuckedup passage on the right behind me ive got a t ahead of me that goes in  two directions but theres a hole in the middle of the t  matt 
none	 correct  liam and theres nothing else  matt nothing else visible in the area  will how far are they sticking out from the stone walls  matt you arent with them  will oh thats a good point  liam i back up against zahra and i say to everyone else because shes right next to me  weve got a t in the passage here but theres a big fucking hole in the way so were going to  need to use our neverending rope perhaps or some means of getting over this hole if we want 
dung	 to go forward  taliesin or into the hole maybe it goes further down  mary i could use my cloak and i could fly  laura you have a wait  mary i have a cloak of the bat and i can use mine to investigate left or right whichever side  youd like and i can do a quick investigation and come back and see  laura you can fly  mary i can i can also cast flight on all of us but that would i think at this point it might  be best to do 
none	 a single investigation  liam how strong are you  mary laughing im terribly not strong at all no but i can get in and get out  liam cant carry any one person over maybe a gnome  laura i could maybe try to leap from the sides of the hole or something  matt where it meets this center area its only about a fivefoot step over  laura and liam oh  matt to the other parts of the intersection  laura i could totally parkour that  matt as long as youre not going directly across 
none	 if youre just going cattycorner it would be a  relatively easy acrobatics check barring you dont roll a one  liam hold on ive got this figured out hold on hold on shush eenie meany miney mo catch a  tiger by the toe  mary do you want to go left ill go right  laura whispering i think we should go down  liam eenie meany miney mo we go rightwards  laura can we look down can we just look down  mary does my darkvision extend at all 60 feet down into the hole to 
none	 see whats there  matt all right as you guys approach vax deftly attempts to leap over to the right side of the  tjunction make an acrobatics check  liam thats a 30something 30  laura three  matt perfect twotoed landing just tading and you are immediately met with a wall it ends  to the right its almost like across the way and immediately to the right both just end abruptly  liam and theres nothing here  matt go ahead and make a perception check  liam 31  matt you can see there are symbols 
none	 burned into what looks to be some sort of a bird head that  ends in these streaks that are carved into the rock intricately and done with a very careful hand  liam groans theres a bunch of bullshit on this wall and a ravens head and i dont know what any  of it fucking means  mary i use my cloak of the bat to fly over and to read it  sam wait you can read bullshit  mary i can read bullshit i have  taliesin oh i read bullshit  mary eyes of the 
none	 runekeeper  matt okay its not a language it is a symbol but you can make a religion check  will are we up there with them now  matt you guys have stepped up to the edge of the tunnel  laura that little ledge wont support i mean is it a long hallway that ends abruptly or is it  this much space  matt its maybe ten 15 feet beyond the break  mary 20  matt 20 this being a tomb of a champion of the raven queen looking at this you gather this is  
none	 the symbol of the raven queen  mary thats the symbol of the raven queen  sam oh yeah that makes sense  laura i drop something down into a rock that i find and drop it down into the hole  long pause  matt sploosh  laura its pretty deep guys  liam what do i hear if i knock on the wall that were looking at  matt quiet knocking solid stone  liam doesnt feel hollow  laura can i since its only five feet away on the left can i look around and see if 
none	 it looks  like theres any similar sort of traps or anything down that hallway  matt okay so you get around and glance around the edge to the left tunnel there is no wall  instead youre met with a large ten foot tall eight to ten foot wide double set of doors  sam doors  liam we should just leave  laughter  taliesin im going to hop over to where the doors are  laura i hop over to the doors too  matt okay both of you guys make acrobatics checks  sam jesus dont 
none	 fall highpitched noise  taliesin 13 14  laura 31  matt okay yeah you guys make it across fine  mary can i just fly over and land  matt kimas getting impatient and she joins you guys across that way shes fine on her roll  marisha yeah ill jump over towards the doors as well  matt okay acrobatics check  will me too  marisha oh yeah i rolled an 18  will yeah 20  sam 15  travis i rolled a one  all no  marisha what  matt so as all of 
none	 you start leaping across into this small tunnel right before the doors taking a  moment to inspect it the final member of the group right before trinket who rolled a two  laura you rolled for trinket  matt yeah dont worry trinkets fine the one was the killer  laura gasps oh my god  matt so you hear a yelp as suddenly that slimelike mass that youve seen appearing  throughout the stonework here has also gathered itself along the edge of this open crevasse in the  hallway your foot hits it and within a moment 
none	 the stones beneath your feet are beneath your feet  no more and you find yourself about to plummet into this  laura can i leap forward and try to grab him  matt this is happening very quickly i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw to  see if you can manage to catch the edge  travis 17  matt 17 actually no because there is slime on this i need you to make it a roll with  disadvantage  marisha oh no  travis 11  matt 11 you grunts just 
none	 catch yourself on the edge your fingers are shh sliding off the edge  right now youre barely holding on  marisha i turn and i cast grasping vine from up here and try and yank him back up  laura trinket turns and puts his claws into grogs hand  liam smart bear  matt okay so in a very scar in the lion king moment whoosh  laughter  travis yells just drop me  matt you do take four points of slashing damage from the claws that dig into your hands as trinket  is holding onto 
none	 you there then a vine streaks out from the stonework wraps around you and pulls  you up out of trinkets grasp slamming into the ceiling and now holding you aloft before it drops  you plopping right into the stonework between the rest of the party  marisha good to join us grog  travis yeah no big deal  laura good to know you can jump at all  mary yes howd that work for you  travis listen an example of what not to do  laura are your hands okay  travis yeah should we proceed 
none	 what is all this dillydally  laura are the doors locked  matt you go ahead and push on the door  liam wait what are you doing over there  laura are there traps on the door i check for traps  liam wait up okay go for it  matt make an investigation check  liam do me proud  laura 16  matt okay looking over it there is what looks to be a locking mechanism on it but it is not  currently locked  liam well that was lucky  taliesin is it  laura 
none	 door squeaking sound i push  matt you push thump it doesnt budge you have to put some of your weight behind it to get it to  shift at all and it creak opens up slightly into a pitchblack room ahead of you  laura oh good more darkness  mary i peek in and using my darkvision see what i can see for 60 feet  matt okay make a perception check  liam im going to catch up with the ladies and acrobatics over to them  matt go for it  liam 20 33 excuse me 
none	  matt yeah yeah you impact around the edge  mary balls ten  matt ten its hard to make out much detail in the room you can see what appears the room just  lays out before you it seems to open up slightly and then even further partway in it ends on the  opposite side with curved corners you can see what appears to be four pillars in the room that  meet the floor to the ceiling the ceiling which is about 25 feet tall most of the tunnels youve  passed through here are about 
none	 15 to 20 this is about 25 feet tall at its full height but these  pillars reach to the ceiling and there are steps across the way what appears to be a raised  platform thats the most detail you can make out of it at this distance youd have to get close  mary cant see much its a taller ceiling there seems to be a platform in the middle and some pillars  laura like a platform like a tomb  mary no i cant see really  marisha like an altar  mary its a slightly 
none	 raised platform thats grog can you help can you do anything can you  see any further than me  travis yeah i come over and cause i have 60 feet of darkvision can i try  matt yeah make a perception check  travis nah i cant see shit  sam all right ill look ive also got darkvision so 12  matt all right you all come to the same conclusion some sort of raised platform across  the way  mary right its sort of a platform but you cant really tell what it is  sam 
none	 sort of curved to the back i could probably sketch it for you  laura can i stealth i want to stealth and perceive im going to like step in  sam oh lets just go in there  liam wait a second hold on a second this is the only thing we can do  laura 20  liam 25  matt okay so you guys stealth into the room you sneak in and you can see now this slimetype  substance that youve seen throughout  laura oh 30 because of pass without a trace which is still 
none	 on us  liam 30 35  matt all right it seems to coat most of the floor and walls of this interior you guys step  inside and with what little bit of light you have you see a couple shapes shift across the  way behind the platform  mary thats not good  liam whispers all right everybody get ready to play  travis what play  laura whispers theres definitely creatures in here i dont know if theyre hostile  liam i reach down are there any rocks or pebbles or anything on the ground  
none	 matt you find a couple of small pebbles  laura whispers can i just shoot an arrow  liam i take a pebble i throw it all the way towards the platform  travis dont waste an arrow  matt okay plop plop plop as you listen you hear a couple of hushed voices undercommon  do either of you speak undercommon  laura i do  matt you do  mary theyre jawas  all ooh  marisha secrets secrets secrets  sam check out the geek and sundry store for fantastic critical rolethemed products and  merchandise there 
none	 are shirts and posters for sale  laura gasps ohh i forgot wait gasps shh  liam whats the matter whispers whats the matter  laura whispers they know were here obviously you threw a fucking rock they want to fight us  whatever it is theyre protecting this champions  sam they want to bite us  travis i dont know if anyone can hear you when youre whispering  laura you want me to just yell it out  will well if they know were here  laura cool hey theres people on the other fucking side and 
dung	 theyre going to attack us when  we walk in here theyre saying to defend his fucking tomb  sam and will oh  will right place  mary so theyve been in the dark for a long time is that right im going to cast some light as  bright as i possibly can  laura im stealthing to the side  liam stealthing to the side  will kashaw jumps up with zahra they cast light at the same time  matt light spell is about as powerful as decent torchlight it doesnt become crazy you know  
none	 gandalfbridgeofkhazaddumstyle  will gandalf voice you shall not pass  matt yeah but it does light up the room and from what you can see now immediately across the  way atop this platform there is what looks to be another stone raised platform or what could be  considered as some sort of a tomb or stone coffin that lays atop these stairs on this upper  platform there is another humanoid figure that stands on top that turns around at the light and  you can see the light giving that weird ominous animal eyeglow whenever the light 
none	 catches it at  an awkward angle the fish face snarling at you robes drenched in various liquid and mucusy fluid  swish around for a minute as it turns to you this fish humanoid clutching this big staff you can  see now three other of these fishlike entities all clamor up from the side holding onto these  spears and these weird bucklertype shields on the side of their arms and they just  loud undercommon  laura and mary whatd he say  laura i want to get up and meet him at a  sam you 
none	 can also make donations to our charities of choice find links to those on geek and  sundry  laura i use my earring and i whisper theyre calling to their master something big i stay  stealthed  matt all right the rest of you  marisha oh shit  liam stealth stealth stealth stealth stealth  matt right we have two of you have stealthed inside and youve rolled stealth for this  laura rolled stealth  mary and we still all have pass without a trace on us  laura yeah everybody still has pass without a

none	 into the top of  the stone sarcophagus in doing so its hand hits it and a bunch of black feathers scatter off the  top and come to rest on the ground at the bottom of the raised platform does that end your turn  liam id like to use the rest of my movement just to sink down with my back against the wall out of  the way of the window  matt okay so that should be there all right that ends your turn kashaw  will okay how far away are they  matt theyre

none	 to rest  on the ground between the three of them as the feather hits the ground it creates this opening of  blackness behind them as they look down all of a sudden the darkness turns to bright searing light  as fire and divine energy just slams up from the ground beneath them into the ceiling and you just  hear these three simultaneous screeches as the flames die down there is nothing left where they  were standing  cheering  mary yes my brother  matt all right and that ends your turn he doesnt have 
none	 a turn anymore at this point in time  will im sensing something big is on the way  sam vax did you see that  liam im under cover im pressed to a wall i saw a flash of something  sam amazing oh sorry i wont draw attention to it  matt there is this echoing mutter this almost burbling that seems to rise up behind kima and  percy at this point  sam oh shit  matt you glance over your shoulder into the darkness below the collapsed tunnel and what  little bit of light 
none	 you see coming through you see something fleshy rise up from underneath its  glistening in places and immediately a cold shudder crawls down your back as you see a series  of appendages release each with a gleaming eye at the end of each one  laura gasps no  matt as one giant eye rises up it  all no  yelling  marisha son of a bitch  travis oh fuck oh fuck  taliesin no  marisha we werent prepared  taliesin not cool  travis happy anniversary you dicks  laughter  laura muffled oh

none	 manage to just duck out of the way slams  into the stone wall next to you of which that stone wall now just turns to dust disintegrated  rock behind you the one against kima see if she makes her save here no she fails this beam  hits kima square in the chest and as it does she doesnt seem to have any physical reaction but she  begins to back up instinctually from it you can see her jaw agape her eyes wide open she looks  like she is filled with the dread of the ages 
none	 and the third beam going towards grog have to reroll  that need you to make a dexterity save grog  travis im not raging or anything 19  matt 19 great a strangely quicksilverlike beam strikes you center in the chest it hits you  and you feel the muscles around your chest begin to seize up and crack into dust like the actual  flesh is turning to a slightly hardened stone but you flex and resist the effect the petrification  not beginning to take hold within your body  travis petrification  laura i dont remember

none	 want to stay where you are  sam well i assume it sees me now but ill slowly back away  matt okay percys in your way so you have to back over in this direction  sam does it kill me while i move  matt no its already made its reaction  sam and then i will turn to zahra and i will sing to her to inspire her ill sing sings zahra a  rainbow zahra a sunrise zahra the moon to wear thats not good enough no not good enough  not for zahra  laughter

none	 the previous ray and is nowhere near the  edge is just thrown off and plummets into the darkness below where the beholder originally  emerged you just hear her scream screams as the echo continues past you dont even hear an  impact that sucked  mary oh my god  matt now its your turn keyleth  marisha oh my god do i still have enough time to do a bonus reaction to try and save her with a  grasping vine or is she gone  matt i will say go ahead and roll a dexterity check

none	 that this mossslime isnt natural its not like a plant  matt correct  marisha and now im going to use my bonus action to go into earth elemental form  matt return to form  marisha yes this worked last time  mary what does that mean keyleth  travis she turns into a giant rock monster  matt that ends your turn at the end of your turn its going to use another legendary action to fire  another ray this one is going to be this is going to be at scanlan as its the one thats

none	 a streaking beam it sounds like a shrieking voice just shrieks streaks out and slams into  you this black solid beam you take 55 points of necrotic damage  laura gasps oh my god  sam yeah sure sure yeah yeah  taliesin i hate beholders so much  matt that ends keyleths turn kimas turn  laura is she unconscious or is she awake  matt were going to find out  taliesin shes possibly still falling it could be a really deep hole  will shes like damn this is taking forever  matt does not make 
none	 the acrobatics check  laura oh no  liam look at this guy hes cold as the universe  taliesin doing so much math  matt okay you hear a distant echo of a slam of impact that seems like the breaking of water  along with the hitting of stone you hear this distant echoing groans ouch  laura okay shes alive  sam wait we hear her say something i mean shes not underwater drowning or anything  matt correct the hit of water and stone sounds like wherever she landed it was shallow enough to  impact 
none	 when she landed but not enough for her to like sink or anywhere but she is right now  effectively out of this fight ending her turn zahra youre up  mary all right if i move to this tiny little alcove right there can it see me  matt youre not within its main eye but it can see everything around it  mary then im going to hex it no no im going to use witch bolt  matt all right what level  mary im a warlock what level can i use it at  matt well 
none	 what level would it be it would be your max level as a warlock  mary i dont know im sorry  laura six seven  mary six seven was last week and that doesnt count anymore  will no you cant finger it to death  mary i cant finger it to death and i want wait what  laughter  taliesin wow  mary which is a plus 11 attack bonus and then 5d12 plus two  matt so you yeah correct well technically it would be 6d12 if youre doing it at a sixth level  mary 
none	 oh 6d12  matt go ahead and roll to see if you hit first you have to roll to itd be a d20 and add your  ranged spell bonus  mary what is my ranged spell attack bonus do you know that  laura your ranged attack bonus 11  mary 11 and what is that i think its a nine 20  matt okay so you rolled a 20 total that hits go ahead and roll 6d12 lightning damage  laura 6d12 holy crap girl  marisha thats hot  will god i cant get fingered to death 
none	 outta my head  mary 24 close better than the other ones  matt 24  mary 24 plus two  matt okay so 26 all right so the lightning blasts into its side one of the nearest stalks  just looks over at you to acknowledge the impact and you just hear a slight snarl as the eye looks  out of the corner towards you is that going to end your turn  mary mmhmm  matt brings us to the top vex youre up  laura okay am i can it see me in its eye would 
none	 i be in its thingy  matt it is looking in your direction  laura im going to move stealthily along the wall so i can maybe be out of that thing can i be  matt you dont know well find out when you stop to there you would still be in the eye range  laura fuckin shit bitch  liam only she can get away with that none of the rest of us can  laura am i hiding am i still hidden  matt no because you revealed yourself in the attack you did a little 
none	 while ago i mean you can  duck partially if you want to use an action to try and hide you can do that  laura no i dont want to do that i just want to make my motion hide behind a pillar maybe  sam oh wait remember laura you can move a little bit faster because you have 30 gold less  than you did earlier  laughter  will but shes weighed down by the book  laura yeah i appreciate it my pouches are still pretty heavy im going to hold my action until  
none	 hes looking away from me and i want to move trinket behind the wall  matt so trinket moves behind the wall there looking over at you you can see noticeable fear  in trinkets face all right at the end of your turn its going to use its third legendary action  its going to take another eye roll another eye beam this one is going to fire at grog  groaning  matt actually no not grog it can still see the pillar no grog because youre one of the few  like big individuals in its front 
none	 way thats not in its ray  travis does the pillar grant me any cover at all  matt nope well see what it does though all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw  travis 19  matt 19  travis 20 actually 11 plus nine is 20  matt all right cool so as a yellowish beam streaks across and slams into your back you feel  your back muscles tense up and lock up and you resist the effect once again you just have that  hardy constitution of a goliath who seems to 
none	 be resisting every one of these beams that slams into  you for the time being vax its your turn  liam im going to use cunning action to hide and then im going to run along the back wall to the  pillar by across from vex at the back of the chamber and if counting is right im 60 feet  away from the beholder  matt youd be just within 60 feet  liam just within right thats what i thought and im going to throw three daggers at his  fuckin eyeball  matt go for 
none	 it you used your bonus action to hide so you get two attacks  liam two attacks but i got the hasted boots on i clicked the heels  matt right but you only have one attack with your main action  liam oh right thanks and do i have advantage no ones near him right  matt you have to roll a stealth check to see if he sees you or not  liam all right use my last luck no thats okay because im me so that is 25  matt 25 okay so go ahead and roll 
none	 your attacks  liam all right so the first attack was an eight 18  matt 18 hits and you do have advantage on these because he does not see you  liam okay so the first attack was 18 plus sorry it was 30  matt hits  liam and the second attack was 28  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage and sneak attack on the first hit because he did not  see where you were surprisingly being an entity covered in eyes  liam one plus two five ten 11 15 16 17 20 
none	 for the first no 27  matt seven yeah all right okay  liam and then the second attack is ten  matt got it 37 rushing up behind the side ducking into the shadows you go around the pillar  and watch one dagger spin around and watch a second one both of them sinking into him adjusts  in place angrily from the pain and impact but yeah  liam i also make a little like raspberry noise at the end and go pffbt  matt cool thats what breaks your stealth not the attacks strangely okay that 
none	 ends your turn  kashaw youre up  will i know but if hes looking right at me i mean he can see me essentially looking right at  me correct  matt everything else except for you and percy are directly out of the main eye but his eyestalks  look all over the entire room and they keep shifting and taking in the awareness of the  surroundings but the big eye is just staring right at you intently  will can i get out of the direct well can you cast magic against the big eye or 
none	 no  matt you dont know  will so should we give it a shot see thats the thing is hes staring right at me  marisha you could move out of it  will first thing we want to do is run away can we get out of the range of the eye somehow  matt possibly you have not encountered a beholder in your time go ahead and roll an  intelligence check  will god its ironic that i dont even know how to do that  matt just modifier  marisha plus two  will yeah 
none	 so 12  matt do what you want to do  will thanks for that how far away can i get  matt i mean you can move six squares 30 feet so  will two three i want to get away from the eye can we move to behind that wall is that possible  matt yup  will and then i still can see him though but he can look at me and im just going to be  wasting stuff if he so im going to hold my action until hes not staring right at me can 
none	 we  do that  matt sure  will theres not much i can do yeah so thats what im going to do going to run away  matt okay that ends your turn it is now the beholders turn the beholder is going to float up  towards the ceiling of the area  liam how high does he go  matt this is going to put it at  will 25 feet right  matt this is going to be lets see need to find something to weigh that down actually  taliesin make a sandbag  matt 
none	 perfect all right so it is approximately 20 feet up right now which gets it out of  predominantly melee range of most anything at the moment  laura so now when it looks down at us does it change the direction of the cone  matt the cone still spreads in the area and its going to look right there so it looks away from  you kash so what action did you want to prepare  will should we try it now do you think im going to try to blind it so if he cant see  
none	 maybe he cant do some shit so im going to cast blindness at a third level  matt okay  taliesin hes reading blindness right now  matt all right so constitution saving throw that is a 19 wheres the dc  marisha its fucking 18  matt it resists the spell unfortunately  will oh shit  matt however it is now going to make three eye ray attacks lets see whos in the radius here  it cant get a ray towards the four of you so its going to do one ray at zahra one ray at

none	 19 points of damage  matt all right great the blade sinks into it as you yank it back go ahead and make an  athletics check to pull the blade back  travis oh thats an eight  matt thats an eight you yank on the chain and its just still embedded in the bottom of the  beholder you cant seem to pull it back  travis thats all right go for a ride  liam its like a balloon in the macys day parade  travis i did get the one strength one  matt you did 
none	 yes all right grog is that the end of your turn  travis yes  matt scanlan youre up you lucky lucky gnome its your turn  sam hes 25 feet up  matt 20 feet up technically  sam if i aim a fireball right at the roof will it hit any of us  matt right at the roof  sam 20foot radius  matt it might you dont know depends on where youre hitting if you aim it up here it may hit grog  laura just do it  sam ill aim on the far side 
none	 of the beholder  matt over here  sam yeah just up from there  matt well you cant see that wall area because its all blocked there you can only see through  this passage so you can only hit anything on the ceiling and this way unless you move into the room  sam well ill just try to get it as far away from grog as i can  matt okay so well say about there is where you can hit it go for it  sam okay wand of fireballs and ill do it at fourth 
none	 level  matt okay what is the dc for the wand  sam if i use my does that go through the handcone  matt not for the wand no the wand has its own dc it should  sam the wand has ew a dc of 15  matt okay it does make the save so it takes half damage so go ahead and roll damage on that  travis do i have to make a save  matt currently with the blast area no and it would have hit percy except for as the fireball  explodes the 
none	 fire just seems to dissipate around the cone actually absolving the flame from its  current position  sam is he going to be affected  matt he is affected yes  sam okay 30 so 15  matt 15 points of fire damage okay the blast and you can see some stones thuds from the  ceiling from the impact of the blast it weirdly shapes around the cone in the front of its eye  and do you want to move or are  you going to stay where you are  sam if i move hes going 
none	 to hit me i will inch away from the precipice  will i will inch away from the kimahole  taliesin god you even make that sound weird  sam lets see whos going next i will inspire percy with a song i will sing sings and if  were talking percy you got a perfect gun so put it on me and pull that trigger if you shoot him  right youll end his life on and on and on  cheering  matt take a d10 inspiration dice for that all right percy its your turn  taliesin 
none	 first im going to deal with this fucker in front of me so im just going to pull out my  sword and slash him and stab him and see what happens  matt okay so using your quick draw you well you have one hand so you can pull out a second  weapon so go for it  taliesin its a onehanded sword thats 19 to hit  matt 19 hits  taliesin all right and thats ten points of damage  matt ten points of damage with that you eviscerate as it croaks out croaks and just 
none	  falls to the ground gurgling into a pile  taliesin sorry i dont speak fish  laughter  taliesin its the worst kill line ever i especially floundered that one  laura can i ask a technical question  matt yes  laura if ive held my action until he does something and he never does it do i ever get to go  matt nope  laura i just hold it until the end of the turn  matt yep and then you get a next turn  liam so technically thats a gamble and if the thing 
none	 you ask for never happens you forfeit your turn  matt let me check the rules real fast just to make sure because i dont want to screw you over  laura its good to know im gambling that away if  matt let me doublecheck because the internet will let me know if i mess it up its technically  readying an action so  liam did you remember hunters mark  laura i didnt do hunters mark on purpose because i cant do any magic on him because hes  looking at me  matt how it is 
none	 with this essentially is you wait for the trigger or you can ignore the  trigger which means if you want to you can just do it at any point if it never happens so at the  end of the next persons turn you could unleash  laura say screw it  matt totally  liam so you can just chime in and say fuck what i said im going now  matt yeah  taliesin so my other question is my attempt to cast a spell while in the cone does that cancel  out that spell so 
none	 i cant cast it anymore  matt yes the spell is used unfortunately beholders man theyre assholes  taliesin im going to make a run for cover towards the wheres the laser pointer  matt towards which way  taliesin run that way there am i still in its  matt one more if you want to  taliesin okay and while im running im going to take a shot im going to pull out the big gun and  take a shot with the big gun  matt okay  taliesin and im going to attempt to make this 
none	 a legswing hit and im going to try and knock him down  matt does not have legs does not have wings  taliesin oh shit okay thats fair  matt hovering entities arent really affected by prone you would know that  taliesin no theyre not thats very fair in that case im going to just do a sharpshooter  shot and see how this goes  matt go for it  taliesin roll well and i have inspiration which im going to add to that so thats thats 18 to hit  matt 18 just hits scanlan comes 
none	 through again  taliesin thank you thats very useful wheres my other d12 why do i never have any d12s  there they are  matt keyleth youre on deck so be prepared  taliesin nine ten 11 12 thats 28 points of damage  matt 28 points of damage  taliesin and reload and thats the end of my turn  matt thats the end of your turn thats all your attacks okay that ends it with percy at the end  of your turn percy its going to do one of its eye rays this one is going 
none	 to be towards grog  because grog is out of the cone and rushed underneath throwing the blade up and stuck into  it one of the eyestalks shoots down okay grog i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw  travis yeah i get advantage on those because of ddddanger sense 19 21  matt 21 all right not a worry you manage to duck out of the way before it slams into you  all right  travis what kind of ray was it  matt it was a black ray that streaked towards you a ray 
none	 youre very familiar with  travis yeah i remember that one  matt all right keyleth its your go  marisha question did enough stones fall out of the ceiling that might be like meshaped  matt not from the ceiling no you currently only have two  marisha from the fireball  matt no because its mostly flame its the impact and explosion its not enough to damage  the structure of it  marisha is the ceiling considered worked stone or is it just carved out  matt unfortunately it is considered worked stone if you wanted to 
none	 like shape up there and try and  break through it you could attempt that  marisha yeah lets do that  matt okay  marisha like the hole that was already created by scanlans fireball  matt okay so you whats your movement as an earth elemental  marisha well i dunno im doing the earth glide so oh 30 feet do i make it  matt 20 30 its cutting it close  marisha just make it okay and i just want to  matt all right go ahead and make a strength check with the strength of 
none	 the earth elemental  marisha oh wait was that cocked i dont know i dont think so and its not great no seven  matt seven no you pull up and you slam your fist into the stone beneath you and it cracks a  little bit but not enough to give way at all so you are currently resting up in this vicinity  marisha thats my turn  matt i mean thats your action and your movement  marisha try it again next time  matt kima cant do anything right now so kimas just currently trying to 
none	 heal her wounds a bit  she can heal  taliesin okay not dead  liam think ill take a walk  matt at the end of your turn its going to attempt another eye ray this one is going to be  at kashaw five through well actually those they dont have to reroll for the same because  theyre each different turns i need you to make a dexterity save kashaw  will 21  matt 21 you guys are rolling some serious fucking saving throws as a dm who loves using a  beholder its really frustrating 
none	  laughter  matt thats great all right so you dodge the same black ray that just streaked past grog  ducking out of the way as it vmm across the wall all right that brings us to zahra  mary i believe i still have witch bolt going now my question is because witch bolt is a  concentration i still have a cantrip of eldritch blast which is not a concentration may i use  witch bolt just the single  matt witch bolt is an action to use and it only does 1d12  mary yes i 
none	 know but its still going so technically its an automatic 1d12 damage  matt well you have to use your action to do it which means you cant cast any other spells  if you do it  mary i cant cast any other spells  matt yeah  mary big hairy balls all right im going to  eldritch blast plus invoke agonizing blast which  does not use a spell slot  matt all right so go ahead and roll three attacks with your ranged spell attack  against the beholder  laura 12s  mary these are 
none	 d12s i need d10s  laura you need 20s for attacks  mary oh just attack im going to use luck 12  matt plus  laura plus your attack modifier  mary im sorry so thats 23  matt okay so that hits second one  mary groans 13  matt misses and the third one  mary natural one  laura oh no  mary cant luck on that  laura i dont think so  matt all right so go ahead and roll 1d10 plus five  mary six plus five 11  matt 11 points of 
none	 damage as your beam streaks and blasts it from the side  laura i use my action since thats the end of it right i pop out and i shoot two arrows at  him grunts thats it just like groans  will that was awesome  matt both of the attacks do not get the magical bonus to hit and damage so whatever your attack  bonus is minus two to damage and hit  laura because of my bracers no  matt actually it would be minus four all of your magical equipment doesnt work  when youre 
none	 in its eye  laura i know but my bracers only add to damage  matt right but your actual bow is magical and adds to hit and damage minus two to hit and minus  four to damage  laura four to damage why four  matt technically its just supposed to be plus two to hit on that item actually misunderstanding its  all good so  laura well this one is 29  matt that hits and the other one is  laura 20  matt this is with the minus two  laura yeah  matt 
none	 okay they both hit roll damage on each minus four  laura oh god thats pathetic five ten  matt all right 15 points of total damage as you streak around releasing these two mundane arrows  from a mundane bow momentarily both hit and you can see now its starting to look a little rough  its hurting theres streaks of blood out of various wounds its taken it still has craven  edge jammed into its underside stuck in its craw all right so that brings us back to the end of  zahras turn where it uses 
none	 its third and final ray  mary i havent moved  matt yeah you can move if you want to where do you want to move  mary actually im going to stay where i am  matt okay this last ray is going to  travis so tense in the silent moment before he said that  mary i know  matt this ones going to be at scanlan since all of the rays have hit everything else  laura everybodys hiding  matt everyones in his cone or hiding and scanlans the one little visible one there  
none	 laura oh thats right he cant attack anything within his own cone  matt all right i need you to make a constitution saving throw scanlan  sam 17  matt 17 all right jesus christ guys you take as this shimmering purple ray slams into your  chest you manage to get most of the ray to not impact you in the flesh but where it hits you do  take some damage so you suffer 16 points of necrotic damage all right vex youre up  laura i am going to scoffs if i run back to where 
none	 i was standing am i  out of its fricking cone  matt you would be yeah  laura all right im going to do that  laughter  matt youd have to get over there to get to a space out of it  laura all right back to all my magical stuff all right im going to shoot from my sky sentinel  at him thats my first attack for that and that is 22 for the first arrow because it splits  matt that hits  laura 20  matt hits  laura no that was wrong 
none	 no thats right oh that was weird 16  matt misses you get two hits on that with the sky sentinel  laura okay so that adds 1d6 to my damage with those  matt correct  laura okay balls eight nine ten  mary kill it  laura 16 for the first 14 for the second and then my second attack i want to shoot through my  blazing bowstring at it  matt okay go ahead and roll for attack on that one  laura 17  matt as the arrow ignites in the middle of the air 
none	 the enchantment is too strong and actually  burns the arrow to a cinder before it reaches its target just scattering ash against its body  travis i hope that wasnt one you notched with the owlbear feathers  laura oh no that wasnt one of my owlbear arrows for sure im going to duck behind the  wall right there if i can  matt okay actually currently all of the areas of the wall are taken by trinket and kashaw you  could have trinket move out of the way  will fuck you get out of here 
none	 i got this part this is taken  laura no okay i push trinket out and make him run around and hide behind the other wall  laughter  travis wow from the mothers mouth  laura i love you move  mary get out of the way  laura hes got 40 so technically he could make it behind that other wall  matt all right so at this point in time now you can see where the slime all over the walls  all of a sudden a series of tendrils begin to whip out of them  
none	 sam wow  marisha what is happening  matt all right so good to know so now pretty much all of the slimecovered walls in here and  within this hallway are now reaching out these semitranslucent almost created out of the same  slime tendrils that are reaching out and grasping  laura what the  liam over every part of the wall  matt yes  mary how far out  matt out to here so its within ten feet  laura everything at the walls anything hiding  sam oh good im glad that were all right 
none	 next to a wall  matt vax its your turn  liam can you show me where his glance is again with that doohickus you have  matt you have to guess you dont know the specific elements of his ray  liam im going to use cunning action to hide  matt well first and foremost at the beginning of your turn i need you to make a dexterity save  liam yeah evasion yeah dont worry thats 30  matt all right dont say youre using evasion yet it doesnt damage you or you could have  wasted 
none	 your evasion for no reason however you do avoid being grappled as they try and grab onto you  and hold onto you you can use your bonus action to  liam hide  matt all right roll a stealth check  liam that is a 25  matt 25 okay  liam im going to run past trinket along the back wall all around the edge over to where vex and  kash are  matt all right right there  liam im going to keep pushing along  laura this is our spot  liam im going to 
none	 get between them and i know that slows the movement down but i want to be in  there and im going to use my two actions left to throw daggers at the floating fucking bowling ball  with eyes  laura i duck so he can shoot  matt you do not have advantage because it rolled a natural 20 on its perception check and you are  not stealthed  liam oh wow so the first one is a 21  matt that hits  liam yeah second one is a 17  matt that misses  liam 
none	 so its a measly little attack of nine  matt nine points of damage a little toothpick impact that ends your turn  liam no i use the last of my movement to lower down behind kash  laughter  will wow  matt kash at the beginning of your turn i need you to roll a dexterity save  will ten  matt ten the tendrils wrap around you and youre currently grappled which means you cannot move  will okay so can i cast well can i use freedom of movement on myself  matt you could yeah 
none	 if you really wanted to  will but i guess it wouldnt matter because then thats my turn right am i taking any damage as  its holding onto me  matt no its just holding you in place  taliesin it just feels really uncomfortable  will it does its just uncomfortable and frankly just too close to me and now a little creepy  then i guess theres not much i can do  marisha you can still cast a spell  will can i cast a spell still  matt you can certainly try to yeah  
none	 will all right then im going to try even from there being grappled a 6thlevel flame strike  marisha woo  will lets try to do some damage here if we can  matt so hes going to make his dex save which he makes so he takes half damage but go ahead and  roll 8d4 oh sorry 8d6 points of damage  will d6 thats not bad at all so we got ten 16 21 22 23 24 25 26  matt 26 nice so half of that would be 13  will 13  matt 13 points

none	 up and  grabs the back of the beholder like a baseball just palming it thrusting it down towards you  zahra its mouth open it reaches down teeth open momentarily frustrated by the moment its  going to use this to try and bite down as you reach up you slam your staff up into its mouth  and release the witch bolt at ground zero from the inside of its body the eye widens for a second as  the top of the staff pierces the upper part of its palate and with a burst of black and 
none	 bluish  electrical energy the entirety of its skull just explosion just detonates from the inside  sending chunks of slimy flesh and bone and whatever brain matter resides inside the cranium  of this beholder scattering across the room  mary are we all covered in muck  matt yes you are  mary yes  will oil can  laura i immediately call out help kash  mary kash  liam and i start running to the edge kima are you all right  marisha i run to the edge with vax since i saw fucking kima go

none	 slime  and putrescence the real core of where this beholder had been existing at the  bottom of this tomb  laura if youd gone down there i wouldve jumped right down there  matt kimas down there currently holding one shoulder you can see shes tended to herself  with her wounds for the most part on her own but just currently looks up like ive got nothing  as soon as you descend from the pit dangling from the rope she goes okay good  liam hold on lets tie you up grog  travis yeah

none	 loot around the altar and  around the dead bodies  matt okay  taliesin trinket with me if you wouldnt mind and were going to walk up to the altar and push  the sarcophagus open  matt okay so you guys move up and push the sarcophagus open as you guys slowly start  bringing kima up the rope itself tense with the weight cause shes wearing a lot of armor but  it manages to pull her up without issue you go ahead to the top of the sarcophagus there and it  is covered in black 
none	 feathers some of which got pushed off in the battle you shove the top open  and you can see inside a skeletal corpse that is resting surrounded by what looks like very very  fine golden and silver jewelry that have just been laid at its sides and on the corpse itself you  can see there is a set of jetblack studded leather armor that has a series of runic  engravings and carvings along pretty much every square inch of the leather and you can see around  the the mantle of it where the leather mantle 
none	 falls the edge is trimmed with black feathers  marisha thats hot  travis thats fuckin sick  liam thats some labyrinth of jareth shit right there  travis artists go  matt make an investigation check  liam 15 a very average 15  matt 15  laura im trying to brother im going to go look at the stuff that theyre finding okay be safe  liam okay im looking through some bones  laura and i run over to the sarcophagus  matt you find what looks to be roughly within the brief time youve spent and

none	 crappy leather and through all them all about 12 gold pieces  taliesin that can almost buy a book 21  matt you manage as you reach out and grab for the armor as your fingers touch it theres this  vibration and it seems like the shadows the nearby shadows in the corners seem to reach up  towards your hands you pull back in time but you and trinket notice a little too late as theres a  burst of death a burst of death energy that just bursts out for a tenfoot radius around the entire  
none	 sarcophagus you avoid it both you and trinket suffer 56 points of necrotic damage  laura im unconscious trinket  matt does that bring you below zero  laura yeah  matt vexs body falls and hits the stonework and you look over as you see her eyes stare up the  last bit of air escaping from her lungs as the life drips out of her form  taliesin oh shit  mary what  liam whats going on  taliesin running over  mary what running over pouring a healing potion in her mouth instantly as quickly as 
none	 possible  will i can revive her too  mary kash do something  matt the healing potion has no effect and as you go to her you can already feel the clutch to her  skin her body is instantly cold from the necrotic blast  marisha kashaw  matt you glance over at the sudden intense energy of the room and see your sister lying cold and  lifeless on the ground being cradled by zahra  liam the fuck happened  mary kash kash kash  will i can raise the dead  liam i run over 
none	  will i can revivify or i can raise the dead  marisha revivify revivify  will lets do it  liam im already running over im picking her up what happened i was only down  there for 30 seconds  matt do you have it prepared  will what do you mean  matt do you have it prepared as one of your prepared spells  will i believe so yeah  matt check your list to see if it has a little dot next to it  liam im pouring a healing potion in her mouth im 
none	 pouring a greater potion in her mouth  matt okay no effect  liam the fuck is going on  will yes i do  taliesin do it do it  will i do i have it prepared  sam its true its written down its true  taliesin do it  will and i have third levels left  taliesin do it  marisha oh my god im shaking  will i can bring her back  matt you rush over you reach in your pouch and pull out a bit of clustered diamonds in your hand  that 
none	 you keep just in case for such a circumstance and as you place them out you  sprinkle them across her chest pushing vax a little bit away knowing that you need the  concentration on this at which point you pull up the symbol and this type of magic life and death  magic draws a little closer than you feel comfortable with vesh and you realize at this  moment that youre going to have to make the choice to possibly call her attention forth  sam call whose attention forth  liam what are you hesitating for 
none	 do it whatever the fuck youre going to do do it  will she could destroy everything  liam do it  marisha what do you mean she could destroy what do you mean  sam whos she  will i mean the dragons are going to be the least of your fears if she comes back  thats what i mean  marisha kashaw youre running out of time  sam whos she  will im going to bring her back  matt okay so were going to do a quick ritual skill challenge as part of this revivify 
dung	  enchantment so as you grasp the symbol and as you do you can see all of the scars across your  forearm begin to light with a deep red crimson energy just hissing sound and you close your  eyes and as you look up you can see kashs eyes just go straight black and this dark energy  begins to swirl off and as it reaches out it touches the diamonds which then shatter upon  impact and the dark energy seeps into your sisters corpse the back arches though she does  not register on the face 
none	 or any of her movement her body lifts slightly in place her arms just  draped dangling and scraping against the stone beneath her as shes elevated there how do you  guys want to help with this ritual  taliesin i take out three of my shards of residuum and i place them in where the crystals  are as an extra offering  matt okay so you place the residuum across where the diamond dust was shattered and use that as  almost a focus for the energy from the spell all right i need you to go 
none	 ahead and roll an  intelligence check just roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier  laura im going to throw up oh no  taliesin i can use my rerolls as well correct i cant use my  matt thats for saving throws not for ability checks what did you roll  taliesin six  matt six the energy itself vibrates within the glass shards which then shatter seemingly not  able to focus the energy of the spell  mary i take my enchanted moonstone from my staff and place it next to her  matt okay 
dung	 so as you take the moonstone and are you speaking to your patron to aid with this  mary i am  matt all right so as you take the moonstone and hold it aloft you place it near the focus of  kashaws ritual the dull white glow begins to intermingle with the dark shattered energy of  veshs grant and as they impact it creates this strange grey swirl i need you to go ahead and  roll an arcana check roll a d20 and add your arcana skill to it  liam depending on what she does 
dung	 id like to do something next  laura whispered thats good thats good  mary 17  matt okay the grey balances and where the two meet now there is just grey energy seeping into  her body you focusing look up at the altar where the body was and you see the very faint  drifting image of a dark female form looking on who wants to make the third and final attempt to aid  sam i will  liam i do  sam oh sure i will let you do that  liam i pull my sister 
dung	 in close and i say take me instead you raven bitch  matt go ahead and make a persuasion check with advantage  liam 11  matt 11 okay at this point the dark female form that drifts from the altar you glancing up  intently feeling the sudden intense fearful gaze of vesh upon you as it gets closer and closer  the presence is different what you feared was vesh is not vesh actually it is an image a  specter of the raven queen herself the face is formless at this proximity you cant make any  
none	 details its just this perpetually blurred female form of a face the hair just tumbles down past  and as it steps forward no expression no words the hand reaches out towards you vax theres a  nod the magic strengthens focusing through your moon crystal into vaxs body  ill take a picture of this so that no one questions this a moment passes  a second moment passes  the vision of the raven queen nods the head to you steps backward and the specter vanishes  gasping breath fills vexs lungs as she begins to cough her 
dung	 form drifting back to the stonework  your vision clears and you find yourself looking up at the partially broken stone ceiling of the  dark altar into the face of your brother tears streaming down his face the rest of your friends  gathered around  laura what happened  mary hello darling  laura i feel so cold  liam you were knocked out  laura knocked out  liam yeah  laura sighs well that was a close one laughs did we find anything  marisha i reach out and i touch vax on his back do 
none	 i feel or sense anything different  matt no  laura exaggerated sobbing god  mary i take my stone and put it back in my staff  laura why are you crying  liam im not crying stupid  will im all right you people suck  sam i just hand vex 30 gold and say sorry about before  laura what happened  travis you fucking died  mary grog  travis yeah we turned around i pull your brother out of the pit and youre laying there  lifeless on the floor  laura what  matt 
none	 at which point you immediately have this perpetual slapping of wet bear tongue across your  face as trinket is just bear noises nuzzling up against you and like pressing all his weight  against your body to an almost intense degree  laura all right all right your breath is lovely okay how did i  travis how do you feel  laura i feel i feel cold  mary here take my cape  laura how am i not dead then if i died  travis thats a good question vax how are you feeling  laura softly 
none	 vax  liam i walk out of the chamber  laura wait percy did you set off a trap is that how i died  taliesin yes  laura laughing nervously well who brought me back  sam kash  taliesin and your brother  laura oh  travis and zahra  laura oh  marisha i grab kash by the hand and just to him what does this mean  will to be honest i have no idea  marisha how do you feel  willi feel okay i hope the barrier that was sealed has remained sealed or 
none	 this is the start  of very bad things  marisha why did you do that  will cause i knew you wanted me to  travis hey vex do you want any like ale or anything you i got some like firewater  laura yes yeah yeah give me some of that itll warm me up  travis yeah  laura we need to get those those leathers those vestiges or whatever and get the  out of here  travis well i think that was the problem right did we get it  matt no thats the moment 
none	 you touched it is when that blast went off  travis right  laura can we not can we investigate it and see if theres any traps i mean how do we make sure  it doesnt happen again  mary well lets keep you away from it for now darling have a sip of firewater just to warm you up  travis here heres a big flask of firewater  will can we read any of the runes that are on the  matt as you walk back up to the altar and look on the inside the corpse 
none	 is dust the blast  whatever it was while it didnt damage anything seemingly the remains are dust the armor is laid  there same place it was when you found it if a little slumped in without any sort of something to  fill it out also most of the jewelry thats there has turned green and seems to have been  robbed of whatever precious metal it was once contained the only thing that sticks out to you  is what looks to be a black crystal that comes to a point on one end it has a 
none	 loop on it like it  was part of a medallion or a necklace or some sort of a loop to carry on a chain those are the only  two things you see within  mary so the leather is gone  matt no the leather is there the corpse is gone  mary yes all right is there any way to pick this up without touching it i mean is there any  way to can i use mage hand to lift it  matt yeah yeah its pushing the boundaries of mage hand but you can try 
none	  mary i can hold up to ten pounds  matt yeah its full leather armor you can just id say  sam i can assist ive got mage hand as well  travis look im a giant tank and ive got a super long like sword i could try and give it a  pickup if everybody backs away  mary well what if i lifted it up and put it onto your sword and then you could carry it out that way  travis i was going to put it in the bag of holding  mary oh 
none	 put it in the bag of holding can i lift it up and put it in the bag of holding  will again can we read anything thats written on it  mary well we need it thats whats going to help you guys  matt well all the runes are inscribed there you can make an arcana check or religion check one  of the two probably would  mary i glance at it i can read i have eyes of the runekeeper  matt the language is a forgotten language it has been dead for probably since before 
none	 the  divergence but your eyes clarify on it in the arcane nature of your sight you pick up phrases  throughout and it is a tale of the creation of the raven queen it is a tale of her ascendance  from mortal to immortal it is the history of her penance for ascending and taking the throne of  another entity that was supplanted its just seemingly a history tale that is woven in with a  very very strong enchantment and you see within each one of these little runic sections there are  mentions of elements 
none	 fire ice lightning you know it runs through all these various elemental  arcane properties that are bound into this enchantment youre not entirely certain what the  nature of it is  mary well do you want to put it into the bag of holding and then deal with it later when youre  up against these things  travis yeah  sam matt i just did an arcana check and got a 23 does that help us know anything at all  matt okay it is very magical it is very enchanted and id say based on the 
none	 circumstances  in looking at this whatever the blast that was set off here the runic elements that maintained  that trap that were in the sarcophagus are currently expended  sam okay lets take it  mary all right what about the jewelry and the black crystal  matt you can take the black crystal as well  travis it was the runic things in the sarcophagus that set off that blast not the leather itself  matt you dont know but there were two runic circles within the inside of the sarcophagus that  were not visible when 
none	 you first looked into it that are both now visible and expended of energy  travis all right yeah lets put it in the bag of holding you want to mage hand onto my swordy  and then we shishkabob it into the bag  mary yes ill take the crystal as well is that the only thing the rest are all tarnished and  green yes  matt yeah  mary all right so heres the black can i do an investigation check on the crystal at all or  matt youd probably have to take some time with 
none	 it like a short rest to go ahead and ascertain  the nature of it  mary all right well maybe on the way back i dont know get some insight so here mage hand  it up there we are  matt so you gather your findings your first retrieval of one of the vestiges of divergence a  success barring difficult circumstances you make your way back out through the tomb  marisha i walk up to vex and i just say you know he loves you very very much so very much  laura thank you dear 
none	  mary im so sorry but we still have to deal with the water and getting out of here a stone dont  we have a stone wall there we still have to get out  marisha i still have one more control water spell i can do  matt yeah well it wouldnt be an issue well say for the sake of story brevity you guys make  your way up through the temple in relative silence just taking in the moments that have  transpired through the aid of keyleth and the rest of the party you manage 
none	 to make your way  back out the way you came parting the remnants of the marrowglade loch and start making your way  back in the darkened evening hours towards vasselheim  laura we need rest  matt do you want to rest on the outside of the loch here  laura i feel like we should maybe camp and sleep and rest up and get i dont know  its up to you guys  travis yeah no i think a little treeline rest would be a good idea before we go anywhere else  mary i pull 
none	 vex aside and say walk with me for a moment  laura okay  marisha and i go with kashaw  matt okay  mary im not sure what just happened but i need you to know that youre very dear to me ive only  known you for a short period of time at any rate while you were gone and im not sure how  much time ill be spending with you from now i have something for you after our fight with  rimefang i forged something for you as well and it is one arrow of 
none	 dragonslaying and i want you  to have this if for some reason im not here or i cant help you i want you to use this to do  whatever you can to get rid of these things  laura whispers thank you zahra  mary youre welcome  laura want to kill it  mary yeah i want you to kill it and i want you to write me and tell me how you did it details  lots and lots of details  matt now its keyleth and kashaw  marisha you know kashaw for a cleric 
none	 i was concerned maybe you didnt believe in much at all  and i was very unsure of how you got all of your radiant powers considering i didnt know what you  believed in but you must believe in something so what is it  will i believe in life thats all i was raised to believe in was life when youre married to  death its pretty much all you have and i didnt believe in any actual person until i met zahra  she saved my life she didnt have to but she did and she started 
dung	 to teach me what it meant to  have family i didnt really know what that was like until i first saw you guys together i  figured there was no way that was going to happen and then there she was and suddenly i had a  sister once again i realized that at the end life conquers all  marisha well you did our family a great service today and you didnt have to do that  will yeah vax wouldve killed me and like i said i believe in life mine above all others  hes a 
none	 good guy you know and a hell of a warrior a little creepy the way hes always  staring at you but i cant really blame him  marisha you know youre a good guy too even though you try really hard to pretend not to be  will dont let that get out i got a reputation  marisha thank you for everything  will there is something you have to do for me though you got to go and kill these fuckers  marisha you actually think we can do it  will i dont really know but

none	 own bahamut arc of protection on the tree below where you guys are set up as  everyone gathers around she kinda gets your attention for a moment and goes all right so  best that i can understand we have most of our allies and many of the survivors at your place  right in whitestone  taliesin yes  matt while youre seeking most of these things thats where the bulk of our hope resides this is  also you say where allie is and where the rest of the survivors of the council are  taliesin yes 
none	 everyone everyone that we could save  matt okay well for the time being im probably going to head there and make sure that we  have defense in case any of these dragons manage to get some sort of wind that this is where their  possible usurpers are theyre going to hit it and theyre going to hit it hard want to make  sure that we have at least a decent chance of defending these people so i figure all strength  that we can spare beyond those that are searching for these artifacts go and stay 
none	 there at the  moment besides itd be good to catch up with a few friends myself  mary lovely meeting you lady kima come and find me when you return to vasselheim  matt youre welcome to join us in whitestone we could use the help over there  laura both of you  matt i can guarantee you probably seeing what you guys can do today we can definitely make use  of that better over there than killing things for cash here in vasselheim but to each their own  just a noble cause helping your friends 
none	 whatever  mary id have to put it to the group of vox machina is that all right with you  laura yes well meet you in whitestone  taliesin whitestone would be honored  mary id be more than happy to id be honored actually  will as would i but damn this is going to be awkward now we just had the whole big thing  all right  marisha well i mean were wed be passing through itd be  will yeah fair enough wed love to help just the world and everything so  marisha just

none	 guys thats awesome  taliesin we havent had a neardeath in ages i am so sorry i am so sorry oh god  laura i had just rolled an investigation before i could even i had just rolled to check for  traps and then you pulled the stuff  matt its only the champion of the goddess of death man  laura no you know what thank you all of you for not  marisha yells what did you roll  matt huh i rolled a 12  laura a 12 okay what were you aiming for  matt 
none	 the dc starts at ten each failure increases the dc by one and a success lowers it by three  so it had gone to 12 and the success had brought it down to a nine if i had rolled an eight or lower  youd have been gone for good  liam would she or would i  matt well she wouldve been gone for good you wouldve had to have made a very serious journey  elsewhere possibly to make that exchange  mary what about trinket  laura he survived he didnt even go below zero on 
none	 that hit i was just already at 41 so it  lowered me he had four hit points left  travis the best part of that was that you were totally out of the blast range and you were like  i want to go be there when they open up the sarcophagus explosion  will yeah she ran back totally  laura i know no believe me i am aware that my greed fucking did that to me i am aware  will life lesson  mary and will she learn from this moment  will i thought for 
none	 a second i hadnt written down that spell i was like oh my god wait i didnt  write oh yes there it is thank god oh my god  matt you still couldve done raise dead it just wouldve been a little more expensive  will thats crazy though  marisha well i thought raise dead just brought them back like to life as a zombie thats what  i thought  matt no no no no raise dead is a proper like resurrectiontype spell it just is really  expensive and its a ritual there are limitations to 
none	 it revivify is good but it has to  be used within a minute  which means when you used previously before and we were in midcombat and i didnt want to do  the whole frickin ritual in the middle of the battle so i let it go through  marisha because pike got on him next turn  will thats crazy  laura ashley was texting as it was happening like no  matt thank you mary and will for  travis thank you mary and will yes  marisha and mary getting the how do you want 
none	 to do this again  matt yeah i know man  mary i like big beasts and i  matt that was that was a good that was delightful overkill that was like six points  left on that beholder and youre like oh like 70something  mary look my timing is fucking perfect though i always get either the hellish rebuke or the  witch bolt right its all about timing is all because he was really slashed up  matt he was wrecked  laura still  mary yeah he was  matt guys well done well welcome
