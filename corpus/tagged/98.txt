none	 groovy critical role theme  matt and welcome back everyone that was pretty weak  travis i know im sorry  matt last time we left off the mighty nein had gone towards the evening nip where they had  finally crawled into the subterranean hidden basementtavern where the gentleman does his  business you had encountered yasha who joined back up with the party you had a brief discussion  with this gentleman which led to a bit of cardsharkery from fjords end a fair played  game made quite a bit of money and earned his favor there 
none	 you discussed what was to be done  with this new arrangement he took some blood as it was required of him to make sure that he  could ensure  laura wait what  matt yeah  laura just kidding i was watching  matt you were watching you guys said that you were possibly looking for furthering some sort of  relationship for business purposes but for now you had an individual who needed to be smuggled  out he said it would be fine but one favor requires one in return and to prove yourself both  
none	 capable and he had heard some tales of which you had done within zadash he requested that you go  and inspect this newly discovered buried ruin this series of chambers that exists on the  outskirts of their underground river escape towards berleben and the ounterloch you went  ahead and retrieved horris brought him back he was then supposedly it seems to be so sent off  and escorted out of the city safely  laura quietly they killed him  matt they totally killed him they probably killed him  sam but these criminals promised us  
none	 matt laughs you found yourself down towards the subterranean docks to this river by the way  through all of this molly was having a mild panic attack about his story encountering cree and  apparently being called the name lucien and nonagon  laura nonagon  matt upon making your way to the docks you were given two boats and utilizing them to move further  downstream towards where the exterior of this ruin was discovered you all gathered your supplies and  by the glowing orbs of calebs dancing lights ahead of you we left off with you 
dung	 traversing  deeper and deeper down the dark tunnel and river  sam do we remember which boat we were on  laura i remember that fjord asked me to be in his boat  travis dont read into it  ashley i was with caleb and nott  matt usually i do this just before the game and i totally forgot to  sam thats okay we can just do it now while people are watching you  matt thats what im here for thats okay  liam its like a real game  travis yeah the boats were 
none	  liam yasha caleb nott  laura yeah  marisha and beau jester fjord  sam great done  laura nonagon singing na na nana  taliesin its going to be in there isnt it  matt so yasha caleb nott and the other ship was fjord jester beau and molly  laura yeah  taliesin everybody have their stuff together  travis oh gosh our ship is way better than you guys  laura our ship is so colorful  liam dinghy battle  marisha laughs whack  matt heading down the tunnel the two boats the width of 
none	 it is just enough to fit both of you and  occasionally you have to pick one or the other as it begins to pinch a bit and then expand i will  say due to weight unless somebody wants to actively paddle the boat with caleb yasha and  nott will probably be taking the lead in those moments  sam yeah  laura although i think probably fjord i should be the one paddling the boat because im a bit  stronger than you  travis well thats why youre on the boat  laura okay  travis 
dung	 yeah did you think it was for another reason  laura no i just no  liam yeah yasha are you paddling  ashley yeah  liam yeah so we would be at the front of the boat going  taliesin the back of the boat would actually be up a bit  travis bow up  matt each couple of splashing sounds that hit as the oars hit the water and the occasional crack of  the water against the brook or a rock in the center you being to maneuver your way through  this dark tunnel with 
none	 just the low light that youve been applying it gets colder and colder  the further down the tunnel you go and while it is moist you begin to see your breath just in  general this low in the ground  liam terrible  sam jesus laura  travis literally 12  laura im glad im back  matt we are too laura we are too it would take about a mile journey to get to where they  said this would be so you have a few minutes is there anything you guys wish to do prepare  
none	 laura oh gosh  sam prepare oh  taliesin youve got your holy oil right  sam me  laura are we going to fight undead things what is going on  matt you have time youre traveling  sam i forgot did you give me holy oil  taliesin i believe or was it  marisha you gave me holy oil and you holy oil  matt holy water not holy oil  sam i have it apparently well what am i supposed to do with it  taliesin you throw it at something that looks evil its pretty 
none	 simple  sam should i dip my bolts into it  taliesin it doesnt work that way sadly its not  marisha its a like a splash grenade  taliesin water balloon with glass  sam okay  travis hows the light in here by the way  matt the only light you have is the light from calebs dancing lights which hes reupping as  soon as it completes its one minute cycle each time  travis okay  laura this is just like that scene in tusk love  sam which scene  laura the scene where the 
none	 ship is sinking and oskar and genevieve have to paddle to shore  marisha it was guinevere  laura guinevere thats was it was i remember oskar a little more only oskar was paddling in  that one  liam it is sad when ships sink  laura it is  marisha where do you why  liam i dont know  laughter  matt so you guys continue  liam pigeon cooing  matt continue down the river for a short time the river splits up for a bit and actually divides  into two tunnels  sam where 
none	 are we going  laura should one of us go in one and one of us go in the other  liam that seems not like a good idea  sam i know something about sailing the right one is the bow and the left one is the stern  laura should we go in the bow or the stern  travis is there water running to the left or the right does it look like it picks up current on  either side  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because of the low light  travis oh 
none	 thats a fucking two thats four yeah  matt hard to tell at this distance and its coming up quickly  laura can we feel more wind coming from either side  matt make a perception check  sam and laura wind  travis water  marisha heart  laura 21  matt 21 it does not appear that the wind is picking up one way or the other but its  approaching very quickly  taliesin is the general feeling of supernatural unease coming from either of the or any signs  of i know that were going to 
dung	 be facing probably some willowisps or something like that  laura you should row backwards too yasha  matt i mean the general sense of ominous dark future tunnel but theres nothing supernatural  about the darkness ahead of you  travis anyone have a preference  taliesin any sound coming from either of them  marisha do i notice any textures on any walls they talked about the north side of the wall being  more textured and having a pattern  matt that being what gave them the idea that thats where this is thats where the entrance 
none	 to  this  travis were heading east right  matt you guys are heading east yeah a northeast path  sam well were in the lead boat and yashas paddling so yasha its up to you  ashley im rowing back  laura i think left  marisha try the north side  ashley i go right no im just kidding ill go to the left  matt so as youre paddling backwards yasha adjusts the oar and changes the trajectory of the  boat and heads it toward the left path do you follow suit  laura should 
none	 i follow them  travis yeah i think thats a good idea  laura okay  sam good oar work  travis its like a steering wheel  liam nice carrot top nice  marisha were on a jet ski this is great  matt most spastic rowing partner ever heading down the water path does pick up a little speed  and seems to dip suddenly before picking up with a mild splash but you catch yourself  marisha whispers were on pirates of the caribbean  matt it slows down a little bit and you start seeing a 
none	 few rocks that break the surface and you  have to maneuver around them one you push off with the oar to make sure that your boat doesnt  strike it youre not going fast enough to where it would damage the actual boat but it could list  and get stuck on it if you were to not be careful you push off thankfully because you both have  light sources here  liam yasha can you use your oar to see how deep we are does it touch bottom  matt okay it gets just to the very 
none	 edge of the oar before it touches bottom  sam how long are the oars  matt the oars are about five feet long  laura so youd be fucked  sam thanks  travis can you swim can you swim nott  sam no what  ashley well you could get on my shoulders if you  sam im not going to get in the water dont worry  marisha have you been practicing any of the techniques that we tried out  sam yeah ive been practicing one technique its called wearing this ring of water walking  
none	 laughter  marisha sure thats good  sam tried and true  liam unfucked  taliesin you could literally be walking along side of the boat  sam oh thats a good idea can i ghost ride the whip  liam excuse me you could be stealthing ahead at this moment  sam oh im going to gingerly  travis oh my god please  sam just ghost ride  travis barefoot ski  sam barefoot it onto the water and see what happens  matt on the water okay as you reach over the edge of the boat and 
none	 slowly lower your tiny goblin  feet across the surface breaking the water water splashing  cheering  matt go ahead and make a general dexterity check for me please  sam ooh not good but its dexterity so six  matt okay  sam this is fun hand me a rope ill water ski  matt as youre so entranced by this you glance down just in time to see one of those stones  thats protruding from the river seems to have come out of nowhere before you have a minute to  punch off it hits you 
none	 across the knee and bruises the heck out of it your whole leg starts  throbbing and youre like ah so your skiing is now crashing splashes underneath  sam all right ill try to pull myself back up  matt all right it takes you a moment and caleb you go and help get nott up onto the boat but as  you do a little water logged the water splashed over your face a bit  sam jesus thats an intense water ski  matt because at that moment the lights go out as soon as you pull 
none	 nott up into the ship theres a  brief moment where nott breathes and looks back up with a smile about to say thank you before you  see out of the corner of your eye one of the stalagmites at the top of the ceiling detach  float down and open up almost like an umbrella before it lands and collapses on top of nott  laura gasps its just like the rug  sam ah what happened whats going on  matt with advantage because it was with a surprise attack on that one so that would be 
none	 a 19  to hit whats your armor class  sam of course that hits yes  matt all right nott that is five points of bludgeoning damage and it is attached to you you  now see a pitch black and gray spined octopustype creature that looks from the exterior like any  other part of the cavern wall but has these deep sunk red eyes at the top of its base and its  completely wrapped around the top of nott and is currently crushing down on top of her i need you  all to roll initiative 
none	  liam in the boat  laura oh my god  liam i had these miniatures i forget what theyre called  ashley oh thats terrible  liam i dropped my colville meteorite  sam were already in it we just started  travis thats the best  marisha oh thats cool  liam oh i got a 20  matt it doesnt count if its on the floor dude  travis there are limits  matt there are  liam oh i got a one  sam wait were rolling ones thats 100  cheering  laura i rolled 
none	 a one too  cheering  ashley thats 300  sam two  ashley wait did you roll a one  sam no  ashley oh okay sorry i got excited  liam the 20 would have been nice though  ashley and travis what is math  matt molly roughly where are you on this board  taliesin i would assume im in the middle  matt all right fjord and beau in that order  travis yeah thats good  liam thats so cool  ashley this is awesome  laura oh cool i like the cat just 
none	 like blah  matt you now see this entity has fallen and latched on to nott so in that degree  sam jesus  travis uh oh  matt all right 25 to 20  travis nobody  matt 20 to 15  travis 15  sam wow thats it we suck  marisha we did bad  laura we rolled real bad  matt 15 to ten  marisha nine  matt hold on 15 to ten  sam ten whoa what you guys are all single digits oh boy  ashley i always roll shit initiative  sam 
none	 you do you really do  ashley i dont know what  matt historically  ashley yes  matt all right ten to five  marisha nine  matt beau at nine  taliesin seven  laura five  matt wow molly jester thats everybody right  ashley four i rolled four  matt and four  liam und ein  laura you dont have any initiative  liam oh do i oh sure two  laura okay so you rolled a three good job  liam no no plus one so now its two  ashley whats a two 
none	 in german  liam taliesin and laura zwei  sam taliesin laura eins zwei drei  sam thats it thats all the numbers in german  matt caleb youre holding up the rear  liam ja of course  travis oh god im first  matt first and foremost fjord youre up  travis yeah right okay  matt it has completely attached itself and the end of its tendrils coming to these pointed hook  protrusions this thick flesh webbing between each of these tentacles that form the umbrellatype  shape have all engulfed most of nott and you 
none	 hear the muffled muffled yelling from within  and the little bit of the feet trying desperately to hold onto the boat and maintain balance  travis jesus do i have a clear line of sight to nott and octopus fuck  matt you do  travis okay i wont hit caleb right  matt probably not you know what youre doing  laura it looks like no im seeing your angle  liam im pretty sturdy though so i wouldnt sweat it  travis as im looking is it nott and then octopus behind it or is it enveloping 
none	 him so i cant  matt no its enveloped and is currently wrapped around  travis all right im going to send an eldritch blast towards the octopus  sam ashley and taliesin muffled yelling  sam not again  laura oh my glasses are in my car shit  travis thats a 21 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis that is 1d10 that is eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage nice does that end your turn  travis yes  sam do i take any of that  
none	 matt no you do not  sam oh  taliesin thats nice  travis actually with my bonus action can i cast hex on umbrella fuck  matt you cannot unfortunately because well no because eldritch blast is a cantrip so you can  travis yeah  matt yes you can  travis woo thats 1d  matt well you would have had to have done that first  travis thats right thats on the next thing right  matt correct but next time it gets hit by you you can add extra damage  travis copy that  matt 
none	 okay that finishes your go  laura oh its like hunters mark  matt now its their turn being attached to there the strange darkmantlelike beast  travis can it have disadvantage on strength checks  matt it can sure  travis i never said that before i got to remember  matt yep there you go strength checks it is all right  marisha its okay its not that big a deal  matt you watch as it begins to slowly crush around nott instead its eyes flash red and you  watch as a familiarlooking orb of blackness 
none	 emanates from it completely filling this space  with darkness so at the moment everyone on that boat is blind  ashley wait i dont think i can since i have danger sense can i be blinded  matt you can be blinded but you have advantage on dexterity saving throws against things that you see  ashley okay  liam but do you see it  marisha so it did like an ink cloud  matt essentially but a magical darkness that radiates outside of it another one going towards  the source of the beam of light that 
none	 had emitted and damaged its ally sweeps down towards fjord and  attempts to go ahead and wrap around  travis shit  matt that is going to be 21 to hit  travis that definitely hit  matt you take five points of bludgeoning damage as well  laura wait another one came down on fjord  matt and attaches itself to fjord yeah  laura oh no  travis muffled yelling  laura its going to make us blind too we got to kill it quick  matt that brings us to nott youre up  sam can 
none	 i try to get out of the grapple is that a thing that i can do  matt you can attempt to you have to make a strength check to do so  sam all right i will push with all my little might against the creepy ooh just a strength check  matt yes a strength check  sam 18  matt yeah thatll do it so you manage to break free from its grasp  sam yell thats my action  matt yep  sam i cant see it  matt nope it is just darkness you push 
none	 it off of you and you still have nothing before you you  didnt see the darkness emit from it youve just thrown it off and youre still blind its a  little off putting to you at the moment  sam okay ill spend the rest of my turn trying to figure out if that was caused by just touching  the water because im not sure what happened  matt okay you throw the creature off whatever is on you and its just darkness around you you  start reaching out for some sort of sign of something 
none	 in your vicinity  sam sure  matt are you holding an action  sam i used my action to  matt no thats right thats your turn that brings us to beau  marisha okay im going to go mild screaming and do a straight whack on it sorry fjord its  on you ooh thats a natural 19 25  matt 25 hits roll damage  sam well remember where they are its fine just leave them  marisha what is it 1d thats not great six damage  matt six point of damage to that one all 
none	 right its glomped onto fjords head the rest of it  pulling and wrapping into the insides of his armor you hit it just above where you feel the  impact fjord but its mostly absorbed by the strange rubbery flesh exterior of this creature  travis ow  marisha did i hurt you  travis no  marisha okay whack i deck him right across the face yeah ill take that 16  matt thatll hit roll damage  marisha okay  travis its like getting punched with a motorcycle helmet on  marisha seven damage  matt nice 
none	 you clock both this creature and fjord across the chin no damage to you fjord but you  are a bit dizzy from the impact in the darkness around your face  travis strained i feel like that was personal  marisha ah one more im going to do flurry of blows  sam oh boy  travis impacts  matt essentially  marisha thats a natural 17 thats a four eight damage  matt eight damage nice  travis sick good turn  liam we are level four eight damage sick  matt after you deck the darkmantle across 
none	 the face and fjord you backhand with a full back fist  blow to the side you see it almost detach and its looking like its scrambling to hold on that  finishes your turn  marisha uhhuh  travis i am definitely woozy  marisha sorry  matt that brings us to molly  taliesin im going to take out my swords and just im going to try and cleave some of these  tentacles off see if i can start to get it to lose its grip im going to take my first shot  im going to 
none	 stop saying that thats a 23 to hit  matt that hits roll damage  sam gunshot  taliesin thank you nine points of damage  matt as you take the blade and swing you cut down pretty close to where fjords head is as you  cleave through the body actually splits revealing fjords face as it limply falls off into the  water slinking into the sludge  laura it looks like he was being born  travis thanks  taliesin welcome we probably should head towards the other one  matt that ends your turn molly  
none	 taliesin that ends my turn  matt all righty that brings us to jester  laura i cant see anything on the other side  matt no you can just see darkness  taliesin but we can boat in there  laura yeah i mean i will move the boat closer up  matt make a strength check  laura oh that was terrible six  matt six okay you struggle it doesnt seem to get purchase youre confused by this  laura i cant move the boat yall  matt well its a lot going on in the moment 
none	 and youre trying to figure out what to do you dont  quite have the gumption to get it catching up relatively fast so it goes just five feet  laura okay does that count as an action or a movement  matt that would be your action on that one  laura cool  sam welcome back laura  laura thanks this is fun guys all right then im going to save  liam mistress of the hunt  laura yeah thats what i got i guess yeah sweet  matt that ends jesters turn yasha youre up  
none	 ashley okay well i guess i wouldnt know this his went into the water  matt well no you have no idea  laura did you hear a splash  matt you watched as it slip around nott and darkness envelop it and thats all you know  travis you heard a yelp impact  matt you know the general direction of where it is  ashley okay can i use the light cantrip and see if i can make some light in the darkness or wait  because im a light bearer  matt you are you spend your 
none	 action to create the light cantrip you watch as it flickers for a  second and the darkness consumes the light the spell has no effect  ashley okay i dont know if i can still do this as a bonus action can i try to slowly move us a  little forward  matt yeah if you want to well thats an action to do that technically so you couldnt you used  your action to do the light cantrip unfortunately  ashley okay yeah okay  matt so thats your turn  ashley yeah thats my turn  
none	 matt okay caleb youre up  liam i went from being able to see almost nothing to seeing nothing i heard nott get scholpped in  and then i heard some cry so i raise up the glove of blasting and im going to fire at where i think  this thing is  laura oh no  sam im dead  matt thats scorching ray for that  liam yeah  matt three attacks  liam three strikes at disadvantage  matt all at disadvantage because youre blind  liam thats correct okay good for the first is 16 
none	  matt 16 hits  liam yeah let me do them all 11  matt 11 just hits  liam und 15  matt all three hit actually even blinded  liam frantic noises plus that is ten the total is 13  matt 13 points of damage all together right nope it loses concentration on its darkness  cheering  matt but is still standing you watch as the darkness flickers out of the way theres flames  burning around the outside and three giant singe marks on the outside of its rubbery skin its  floating in the 
none	 air there for a second before its going back in for a swoop against the one who  recently singed it  liam okay before it hits me ill say i sit down on the bench and just go whimper  matt all right that ends your turn top of the round the boats continue further downstream  taliesin what are those things on the side  laura oh  sam those are just rocks  laura thats not a rock  sam its fine its rocks  matt top of the round fjord its you  travis im going 
none	 to cast armor of agathys on myself  matt you watch as the moisture from the air and some of the water droplets from the river from  the splashing of the boat suddenly stick up and congeal in ice form around the outside of fjords body  travis hex is still maintained on that bastard right  matt correct  travis so i can roll 1d6 or do i for the i cast hex on the one that was on nott  matt it only takes the 1d6 damage when you damage it  travis oh shit right  
none	 matt that ends fjords turn another one swoops down and is going to attempt to envelope the one  that scorched its ally  liam i am a monk its fine  matt thats going to be a 14 to hit  liam yeah of course it hits  matt you take nine points of bludgeoning damage and it is attached to you  liam yeah thats wunderbar  matt the one that is still existing is going to attempt to attach to you once again nott  sam no  matt thats going to be a 12 to hit 
none	  sam does not  matt that is a miss  laura and sam yay  laura things are looking up you guys  matt that ends their go nott youre up  sam i will seeing the one on caleb spin around and fire my hand crossbow at that one  matt okay go ahead and make an attack with disadvantage because you are in melee with  another creature the other creature that tried to grapple you is right up against you so it is  still harrying you when youre trying to fire  sam disadvantage  
none	 liam does she get sneak attack since im adjacent to that  matt yeah if she hits  sam it was going to be good ten  matt ten does not hit unfortunately you attempt to fire and at the last minute it shifts out of  the way you can see calebs chest exposed to where you were aiming and you pull back and fire  wide off into the darkness  sam then ill turn again and shoot with my bonus action at the one that im engaged with  matt all righty  sam disadvantage right  
none	 matt yes  sam so 20 to hit  matt 20 does hit you dont get sneak attack however because this guy is not engaged with  anyone else go ahead and roll damage  sam i will still say get off of my boat i cause two points of damage oh wait no six points of damage  liam one question is frumpkin by the thing because frumpkin is an ally  matt i dont know if frumpkin  liam i know that i have read that frumpkin can help me give me advantage  sam but he is 
none	 not engaged is he  liam whatever you want  matt id say for now given the fact that frumpkin is in a small boat and the creature is  flying up i would not consider it harrying the entity enough to grant sneak attack but it  doesnt matter because that was enough to finish it off it had already been damaged quite a bit in  the previous round so as you fire your final crossbolt into that one it impact splash into  the river below you watch as it sink below the water as your boat 
none	 begins to scoot by scraping  noise and begins grinding against this center stone here in the middle of the river its just  barely making its way around finishing that thats the end of notts turn beau youre up  marisha okay is the one still next to me that was attacking fjord  matt no that one has been slaughtered there is one on caleb over there  marisha oh theres one on caleb hes still on top of him  matt it is currently attached to him around his head yeah  marisha im probably not within 
none	 five feet  matt nope theres probably about a ten foot distance between you and the other boat  laura leap for it  marisha yeah thats what im saying im going to do some cool monk shit im going to  sam why do i get disadvantage  laura because its a ranged attack  sam yeah but i ignore all disadvantage with my crossbow expert feat  matt oh thats right because you got a feat for it  sam yeah  matt so you would not have disadvantage on that  taliesin okay  sam well next 
none	 time  matt well well let you roll damage for calebs because it did work  sam thats going to be a lot of damage  matt i forgot that you had gotten that feat go for it  sam wait i dont even remember what i rolled  matt the first one was high the second one was low  sam all right thats a lot its 20 points of damage  liam i would say leave me in that motherfucker  taliesin that was an intense roll right now  sam its okay i dont need it  
none	 matt so with that one moment as beaus preparing you manage one blast of the crossbow that strikes  square into one of the eyes of the creature you hear this this strange guttural pain sound as its  still holding onto caleb but seems to have taken a big hit on your turn beau  marisha confused battle cry continuing on im going to leap across and see if i can do a jump  and a slap with the staff on top  matt for the purposes of this roll an acrobatics check this is a more parkour 
none	 off of the boat  using the weight  liam this is your jam  marisha parkour  travis the boat goes bobbing in water  liam get it altaïr  travis sail  marisha 14  matt so you jump skip off the ground and  laura skip off the ground  matt on the small stone in the center there and use the momentum from that with the staff  swinging go ahead make your strike against the  marisha im going to swing upwards yep thats a natural 16 so 21 i dont know why i rolled 
none	 that  die thats not necessary nine damage  matt nine damage with that you manage to slap that one into two separate pieces that go slapping  and sliding against the wall and splatter and begin to slick down the side of the cavern exterior  marisha i take my staff and i wipe it on caleb  matt your hairs slick back from the blood from the impact and the wound that gets taken  liam in a split second before when i heard a blunt impact oh that was beau  marisha sorry are you all right 
none	 your heads okay  liam im feeling pretty good i feel streamlined  marisha yeah the oils working for you  liam yeah i clean up well  marisha yeah very dapper  matt ending beaus turn beau caleb molly and jester you hear this mild rumble and you watch as  from the somewhat rocky outside of the two sides of the wall these large figures begin to burst  from the exterior and begin to slowly make their way towards the edge so their action and movement  puts them right up to there and this one moves 
none	 up to there  laura earth elementals  matt you see them covered in greenish algae and vines they look like theyre made of earth and  stone youre not certain what the nature of what they are theyre bottom heavy and crawling across  the ground and pulling their body forward youre not even sure if they have feet  laura screaming  sam good gravy  matt theyre coming up to the edge of the river thats going to end beaus turn molly youre up  laura oh my god  taliesin oh  laughter  travis you 
none	 did a  taliesin sure i know are they within striking distance  matt theyre not yet no  taliesin im going to hold my action until somethings within striking distance  matt okay  taliesin i will also say im at least going to back up to the side of the boat where im far  enough away from that thing as humanly possible  matt okay well thats where jester is  taliesin oh well fine  matt so youre like oh jester still has the oars in place does that finish your turn  taliesin yeah  
none	 matt all righty jester your turn  laura oh gosh well i hate to use my action to do anything else but i should probably try to get  away from the thing thats on the shore huh  sam youre going to action row  laura im going to action row  matt all right make a strength check please  laura strength check  sam oar master  laura thats a good one thats just jesters strength thats a 22  matt oh shit jester is power rowing as it begins to motor whir down the river to 
none	 about there  liam half of the skiff  travis got to go  matt you scoot by the entity gets to the edge of the water and then watches it pass its body  shifting it looks powerful but it looks slowmoving  laura im going to use my bonus action to turn around and go eat shit rock face  matt perfect that ends jesters turn yasha youre up  ashley all right yeah im going to try to  matt maneuver around  ashley maneuver around  sam smash into their boat  matt go ahead and 
dung	 make a strength check  liam still the only light in here are my four globules correct  matt correct which actually you had to roll a concentration check for  laura oh god  liam not so good  ashley 19  liam nine  matt all right so it is dark in here remember the dancing lights is concentration  sam can we see anything  matt no it is now absolutely pitch dark  laura its pitch dark  matt its pitch dark yeah  taliesin didnt you cast a light spell  ashley i did  
none	 laura it got eaten by the darkness  matt yeah it dispels the light unfortunately it doesnt encapsulate it it dispels it so you  begin rowing in the direction in the darkness whatd you roll  ashley 19  matt 19 oh yeah without issue you can row past and just begin to get beyond your friends there  laura we crash into each other and get stuck ah let me go  matt thats going to end yashas go caleb youre up  liam foomphs  matt okay a couple lights go up again you guys go from 
none	 darkness to immediate light again and  behind you see the two creatures dragging themselves forward by their upper body  liam i scrabble back and squish in with nott at the front of the boat  matt okay top of the round now the water carries the boats further down  sam we might be okay  matt to about there  laura i think those things are going to get us  marisha eventually  matt well say here with the movement of the creatures actually they cant catch up because  you guys managed to push ahead 
none	  sam action row  marisha full winklevoss twins  matt for the purposes of cinematic movement on this you guys continue to row as hard as you can  looking back with the light pushed towards the back to give a view they are failing to keep up  with both yasha and jester keeping the ships going at full speed eventually they both stop and  begin to back up heading back towards the vicinity where they had originally emerged  disappearing into the shadows and darkness behind you  sam well never know what they were what 
none	 they could have done  laura i know actually im feeling a little guilty for calling him what if he just wanted to  be friends  sam thats true maybe they had information for us  marisha youre feeling guilty for calling him rockface but not for telling him to eat shit i  like that thats great  liam bye  matt as the sounds of the underground river begin to fill your senses once more you settle and  listen and the quiet aside from the slow rushing of the river is all you hear whos at 
none	 the front  of each boat keeping an eye out  travis im at the front of ours  matt fjord moves to the front of that boat whos at the front of the other  liam i guess i am  matt i would like you both to make a perception check please  sam crazy roll there travis  travis forget that i get to reroll thats a natural one  cheering  liam 12  matt 12 okay as you guys are moving along fjord mildly distracted partially from the mist  that is rising up from 
none	 the ice and armor  marisha drinking a drink with cold ice  matt caleb you focus off to the side and to the north side of the riverbank you see a shift in  texture and a mild rock slide part of the wall has caved in a bit and is now pushing into part of  the river  liam halt wait stop  sam he says to stop  laura im trying  sam action brakes  laura squeals  liam can you fight against the current for a moment  laura yeah were rowing backwards  
dung	 liam okay its going to get dark in here for a second all right but dont worry i drop the  globules and i cast detect magic  matt okay so as you focus on whats the range on that one  liam it is only 30 feet  matt 30 feet okay as you guys drift lazily down the course of the river  laura slowly  liam im focusing obviously on the rock slide that you just described  matt as you move in that direction past the rock slide you get a faint source of magic further 
none	  beyond that rock slide  liam beyond the rock slide  matt you get a better look at it actually you dont get a better look because you dont have light  liam thats on one side of the passage that we are in  matt thats on the north side of it yes  liam if i crane my neck in the other direction is there anything on that side  matt nope nothing of magical essence on that side of the chamber  liam all right well in the darkness you hear there is something of an 
none	 arcane nature in the  middle of those rocks that were ahead of us what do you want to do do you want to go scrabbling in  the dirt or do you want to keep going forward it could be something beneficial or it could be terrible  sam are there sides of the river  liam nobody can see anything right now  matt those with darkvision get a better view as they get closer at this point youve gotten  close enough for your magical essence so you get a view of this nott you can see 
none	 on the northern  side of it the cavern wall that has been slowly shifting through millennia of mineral buildup  changes into bits of solid smooth stone and a portion of it collapsed into what this rock slide is  marisha we were looking for a collapse a change in texture  sam we should go investigate  travis yeah  marisha this is it  laura should we park the boats  taliesin lets park the boats  laura can we have some light  liam does anyone have a torch i would prefer to keep this up 
none	 for the time being  ashley i pull out a torch  matt yasha ignites a torch the fire burns brightly and the interior of this chamber now is  very easy to see the details around you the water is still cruising by as you guys begin to make  your way up along the shore a bit stepping off to the side of the river and pulling the boats up on  the rocks theyre not going to continue to be carried down by the stream  sam im going to take my old little dry flowers and 
none	 just stick them in his gross ichory hair  liam do i look like the gentleman right now  matt the gentleman on hard times maybe  liam okay  laura a little less blue  liam its not that weird  matt past about a roughly tenfoot wide portion of this wall that has fallen in part of the  ceiling has come in and above it is just dirt its loose rock and pieces of wellcarved stone  and masonry that have been destroyed apparently upon exiting whatever was beyond this wall  liam can i see what 
none	 was giving me the arcane signature  matt you feel it on the opposite the other side of this rock slide  laura can we clear out these rocks  travis i think we just need to get closer  laura but were right here  liam yeah what about you two beefcakes can you move these stones out of the way  ashley and laura grunting  matt both of you make athletics checks to get through the endurance of pulling these stones out  of the way  laura well thats totally cocked that was terrible athletics  
none	 matt yes  ashley 16  laura 13  matt between the two of you about ten minutes pass as you watch your two beefy companions one  after another moving large stones and rocks scooping them out of the way some spilling and  rolling into the water other ones being pushed off to the side  liam question because the spell that i cast only lasts ten minutes somewhere around the eight or  nine minute mark do i see you said it was on the other side of the rock slide so are they  uncovering anything 
none	 before the spell is gone  matt id say about the time it begins to fade you guys begin to see a faint purple glow through  a breach of this slide leading into the next chamber its a very faint pinkish purple light source  sam like coming from another room  matt coming from that room it looks like theres a room or a chamber beyond  liam so not a door but just a passageway  matt youre just starting to expose it a bit all youre seeing is the light and stone on the  opposite 
none	 end but there is a gap theres about a tenfoot space between where youre starting to  see this and where you see the light reflecting on whatever this other surface is within about then  your spell fades  liam the torch is still up  matt the torch is still up yeah you guys manage to pull the stones from it the final bits leaving  just enough of a space where you can crawl through independently you are now looking into the center  of a spiral staircase  travis i remember they said they threw an 
none	 explosive behind them and dropped even more so  this wont be the first rock slide  marisha they said that the glowing orbs that made the men collapse were purple  sam this all checks out we are in the right place  taliesin does that sound like a willowisp  matt willowisps generally fade like a dull yellowgreen color  taliesin does this ring any bells then  matt not particularly as you begin to move beyond you can look up inside this spiral  staircase above you and about two feet up the corner there is a 
none	 wrought iron cage that is built  into the wall containing a small crystallike stone that is purple in color that is giving off  this light source  laura ooh hey caleb look dont you want to steal that its probably magic  liam its possible that i will want to steal it but can i make anything out does it look like  anything that i have read about or encountered before  matt there have been different artifacts that have been enchanted with equivalents of either  continuous flame or a magic that themselves can emanate light 
none	 the way its affixed to here it  looks like its designed to be a general light source  liam so its a glow stick  matt essentially yeah its a purple glow stick  travis well lets get in there  liam but its in an iron cage  matt like a small iron cage that is bolted into the stone  marisha thats a nice sconce  liam lets continue on  matt okay you have two directions up or down  laura would you want to go up  travis wait were in the spiral staircase and 
none	 it goes  matt it goes up or down you pull through and begin to find your way into the spiral staircase  its about roughly eight or ten feet wide as it continues downward it also continues upward  youre entering partway through the staircase  sam oh  travis we cant see around the bend to how far down it goes right is it an open spiral  staircase or just a wall  matt no no its closed theres an actual column in the center of it so you have to traverse  up or down to 
none	 get more of a view of where it leads  liam before we leave this little cage does it look bolted into place  laura its a couple flights up though you said  matt well no its just right around the corner on the edge locked into the central pillar  travis we can only see as far up as the curves go in either direction  matt yeah it looks like the edges of the cage where the metal has been bent  liam its small  matt its small its about that big and its pressed into 
none	 the stone like the stone was  probably ground into various holes and then the iron was put in there and then sealed in you  dont know how easy or hard it would be to remove  travis unless it lets people know when something crosses in front of it  liam maybe later lets continue on which way do we want to go  laura lets go down usually scarier things are down  marisha im always a fan of going down  taliesin more expensive things tend to be up but im happy to start with down 
none	  sam gross just gross  marisha what  sam youre super gross  taliesin i didnt even catch that  liam you have one setting naughty  sam offensive  travis were going to head downwards  matt all right what is the marching order heading downward  sam were going down do you need me to check for traps  travis yeah please  laura yeah so nott in front  matt nott in front whos after nott  ashley ill go behind nott  sam ill take a big swig of shitty alcohol  matt okay whos 
none	 after yasha  laura i guess i can be after yasha  matt all right jester after yasha  travis im right in the middle  taliesin im after jester or after fjord  travis where do you want to be  marisha ill take up the rears  sam deep voice i always take up the rears  ashley im always a fan of the rears  liam yeah i was going to say not the back but i will let the bruiser walk behind me  matt so beaus at the back keeping an eye open as you 
none	 guys slowly step down the stone stairs  deeper and deeper still  sam check for traps  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  travis thats cocked as hell  sam is that cocked as hell  matt is there a number up top  sam there is but now it just moved  matt roll it again  sam well thats a natural 20  laughter  sam thats an embarrassing 20  matt you guys continue down for about 40 feet or so very slowly very carefully as nott inspects  each individual step eyes 
none	 lurking around looking for any signs of uneven stone of gaps between the  mason work nothing catches your attention you hit the very base of the stairway before it evens  out there is a small intermediate chamber thats about 15 feet wide and only about five feet  sorry 15 feet long and about five feet wide and then a thin hallway about four or five feet wide  that goes on for about 25 feet you dont see anything beyond that there is no light other than  the torch light that you have currently  sam 
none	 its 15 feet long  matt so as you exit the stairs  liam the shaft is  matt its essentially five feet to each way on the ends  laura okay  liam laughing no  sam yeah  travis why are you cupping the balls under your mouth  sam because this is where we are  matt its a rusty trombone man you never seen that  sam this is the shaft in front of me and then theres another a longer shaft so we can go down  that shaft if we wanted to  matt 
none	 yes yes nott that is correct it looks to be five feet to each side of you once you exit the  stairs like a resting space  sam okay these are the balls  matt and then there is a four to fivefoot wide shaft that continues forward  marisha i have no chill you talk to me two minutes later  matt i know im proud of you  liam has it been that long  marisha i dont think so  sam i have no idea of the layout of this room i was just going for 
dung	 a gag  matt congratulations notts been drinking enough where shes not entirely certain where things are  or where you are  laura are we free of traps in this little  sam there are no traps here  laura okay  sam should we continue on straight ahead  laura should we send frumpkin down there and see if its clear  sam or schmidt  liam well schmidt cant see shit but frumpkin can my cat see in the dark i would know that i  dont know  matt cats generally nocturnal i would say it 
none	 would have unless it says in the actual i will  look in the monster manual im fairly certain having grown up with cats that being nocturnal  creatures theyd have it  liam it makes sense for anyone who had gone into their basement and seen the cat go humming  laura oh yeah cats can see  taliesin cats can see your soul  matt they do not have darkvision according to the rules  liam okay well lets go by the rules then  laura the rules need to be changed  matt but they do have 
none	 perception on vision  laura why dont you send your little dancing lights down there with him  liam well i have a range on that i dont like that idea actually  laura what if i just send something thats on fire and i throw it down the tunnel  liam how about i send frumpkin with you and between frumpkin and you well be in good shape  sam me and frumpkin  liam yeah  sam am i protecting  liam youre just peeking  sam okay all right  liam who am i behind mollymauk i 
none	 place hands on his shoulders and send frumpkin down ten feet  ahead of nott and im seeing  matt ten feet ahead of nott  liam yeah or listening and trying to listen and see through frumpkin  matt frumpkin darts ahead down that long 25foot very thin hallway to the opposite side  and in the next chamber what little bit of lights making it in there because its pretty  low light based on what little bit of torch is coming through and its like a lantern light at  this point because only whats coming through 
dung	 that hallway is then spreading out before you you  see a raised platform about a foot high it looks triangular in shape in the center of this room  and thats all you can make out with the little bit of light thats there but the room continues  on about another 20 or so feet beyond that entrance before it goes to darkness  liam so it gets too dark and hazy past that altar  matt correct  liam yasha can you hand the torch down and get it to nott so that she can go a 
none	 little bit further  matt nott are you traveling down the hallway as well  sam im ten feet behind the cat  matt all right as you approach the first bit of that hallway that continues downward you step in  and at that moment you hear this click and glance over to the right of you as you checked  for traps in the stairs but not the hallway you glance off to the side and can see a scattering of  holes on each side of the wall about nine or ten of them at different angles 
none	 and one of them goes  click you glance over before something comes firing out at extremely fast lightning speed  towards you  marisha rogue shit  matt thats going to be a 26 to hit  sam that hits  matt you take five points of piercing damage as a long metal bolt fires out of the hole and sticks  you right in the front of the thigh  sam ah fuck  laughter  sam i found a trap  laura really  liam is it spent now  sam let me check ill see if 
none	 theres any other triggers for this trap  matt on this trap at this floor point you jump up and down make an investigation check if you  want to in the area  sam 22  matt it looks like whatever this trap is the actual entire stone floor around you is a pressure  plate that frumpkin did not set off it has not gone off since youve stepped on it but as youre  investigating and listening closely to the stone you hear a very slow clicking  laura oh its resetting  sam im going to 
none	 go forward a bit onto the next pressure plate  matt okay that is 14 to hit  sam does not hit  matt does not hit this time hearing the arrow firing out of the side and being ready for it  you duck out of the way and it splinters off and sparks against the stone  sam oh god theres many of them  liam are you going to tell everybody about the pressure plates  sam oh god theres lots of traps im dying out here  laughter  laura were just seeing you youre really 
none	 close to us arent you  sam boy oh boy rogues suck how much further until the end of this hall  matt about ten feet from where you are  laura can you disarm the traps so you dont keep just setting them off  liam do we have anything heavy to put on them to hold them down  sam they reset though right i dont know  liam we dont know  sam im on this one and im going to listen to see if this ones resetting also  matt ticking sound  sam okay ill 
none	 see if theres a way to disarm it or plug the hole or something  matt okay go ahead and make a thieves tools check which is your proficiency bonus plus  dexterity modifier should be plus six i think  sam 18  matt 18 okay looking at this central platform here as you inspect it listening to where its  clicking you listen for the holes that are clicking most of these holes are not actually  functional theyre just there to confuse whoever might notice that theres an issue only one of  them is active and 
none	 you listen very closely and listen for the one thats making the clicking  noise and you quickly take one of your thieves tools or not your thieves tools something on  you that can plug that hole a piece of stone something that you might have in your vicinity  that might function to that degree  laura a button  marisha ball bearings you stole from me  sam i do have ball bearings hold on i have so many things  matt ticking sound  sam oh god i dont want to get rid of that thats 
none	 cute a vase  matt the holes are about that big  sam ah shit  matt ticking sound  sam i take my brass doorknob and shove it in there  matt okay there is a section of the doorknob that will fit within that hole you jam it in  there and you push and grind it in there until it feels wedged in the stone and eventually you hear  ticking swoosh and the door knob cracks for a second and theres no more clicking apparently  you have managed to break that device  sam i 
none	 am going to take the doorknob back  matt as you pull the doorknob out  sam shit  matt with disadvantage oh no thats a 12 to hit  sam it shoots out anyway  matt it shoots out anyway but haphazardly and then it breaks  sam great  matt you hear a clanking on the inside of the wall there and that trap is busted  laura are there any more  sam i dont know i check for more traps two for investigation  matt two for investigation  liam has the party held up at 
none	 this point  matt you guys are all just in the back watching this happen  sam i dont know how to be a rogue  liam while that happened i would like to investigate the part of the room that i can see  is there anything dangerous or hinky  matt make an investigation check  liam yes thank you  sam i rolled a seven that was not a two it was a seven  matt okay hard to tell at this point  sam great were all clear  liam 21  matt the chamber youre 
none	 in right now looking around you can see a heavy layer of dust across  the floor and the edges of the wall  liam this is where frumpkin is correct  matt oh sorry i thought you were checking for yourself  liam through frumpkins eyes the half of the room or the portion of the room that frumpkin can see  matt the portion that frumpkin can see is just the center platform the center platform looking  on top has a series of symbols on it looking close frumpkin can see they arent symbols that  are 
none	 drawn on it they are carved in actually the triangular shape resembles that the center hole  is the deepest it goes out of sight the other ones are just mild carvings in the stone  laura oh no is this going to be a puzzle  sam i hope so  laura oh fuck me  marisha definitely a puzzle  ashley so thats whats up ahead  matt yeah you guys are still back waiting for nott to finish walking through  ashley im just going to run across  matt youre just going to run across  
none	 ashley im just going to run across and pick up nott on the way  matt as youre like coast is clear yasha comes rushing past in the time that its taken  the first trap has reset that is going to be an 18 to hit  ashley uhhuh  matt ooh that is 11 points of piercing damage as it strikes you in the back of the calf  actually piercing through the muscle and you stumble for a second you rush past the floor  where nott is no effect the third one it goes off another 
none	 trap that is going to be a 14 to hit  ashley yeah that just hits  matt thats going to be seven piercing damage to that one this one catches you in the back in the  side of your rib cage under your shoulder blade and you manage to emerge into the next chamber with  the torch now wounded  ashley fuck  matt but you made it through theyre both sticking out of you as you turn around and look in  the chamber  ashley maybe nobody else do that  laura no im going 
none	 to run  marisha i feel like this is going well  sam im running  matt all right as you guys run through its still resetting whos going through  taliesin im going for it  liam are we all going  travis ah im running  liam im holding onto mollymauk and just following  matt whos holding up the back  marisha ill hold up the back i want to look around and see if i see anything that looks of value  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because youre now outside of the main 
none	 light the  rest of you rush through making it through the traps have reset  marisha ill take that natural one and give another 100 to 826la  matt beau takes a moment there looking around the corners it looks like this portion of the  chamber is more of an antechamber or something that leads into the next bit theres nothing of  worth or interest  travis yeah just things to shoot you in the fucking legs  marisha wait up for me  matt okay you run to the first chamber it shoots out towards you 
none	 thats cocked thats  going to be a 16 to hit  marisha miss  matt misses just past you the second platform notts already disarmed no effect third  platform does come shooting out at you that is going to be a natural 20  all ooh  marisha i want to catch it  matt okay lets see if it works  marisha knowing its coming  liam its down low though  matt 13 points of piercing damage for that one  marisha 1d10 plus eight  laura you can do it  liam get it  
none	 marisha groan wait how many  matt 13  marisha 11  matt 11 you catch it and it embeds itself about an inch into your chest before you pull it out  marisha i caught it argh  matt you throw the bolt to the ground and continue on to the chamber you only suffer two  points of damage  marisha those are from earlier  sam i am so sorry i did not handle that very well i was told to check for traps and i missed  many of them and i will strive to do 
none	 better in the future and im sorry and this one this ones on me  laura its okay nott  sam im sorry  laura i pat your head you know its a lot of stress youre learning still  sam it is all these traps are different i wish they would just stick with the rope across the  hallway trap  laura then the log coming down  sam yeah thats the one i know its a tried and true classic  taliesin its classic really  matt as you guys now have a moment here to take 
none	 in the chamber around you yasha holding the torch  aloft lighting up the vicinity youre now standing inside a tall octagonal chamber that  rises up about 25 30 feet above you a domed ceiling with abstract designs and symbols written  in each pieslots of this octagon around  laura were at burning man arent we were at burning man  matt no  taliesin this is a great installation  matt you see in the center where all of these triangular pieces of the dome meet in the center  there is a blue thick ten foot 
none	 wide pillar that descends about ten feet from the ceiling about 15  feet above you its square and ominously held aloft  laura that things going to try to kill us  matt below that you see there is that triangular piece of stone and there is no visible exit to the chamber  travis is that triangular piece of stone raised off the floor  matt its raised off the floor about a foot or so  travis how big is it  matt for each side its about two and a half feet  marisha its this 
none	 thing  matt its that thing  sam how wide is the whole chamber again  matt the whole chamber would probably be about 50 to 60 feet wide  laura oh wow its big  travis if were just coming into the area which edge is pointing towards us the flat or the point  matt from your perspective entering this would be the front end and theres these two sides  there you have the dome with all these symbols and strange designs upon each of these eight  pieces of the octagon dome  taliesin do i 
none	 recognize any of these symbols does anything look familiar  travis from your brief life  matt what skills are you trained in  taliesin skills  matt yes  laura what skills you got  taliesin i got acrobatics insight deception sleight of hand  matt okay what do you have proficient in  travis whistling going to have to get back to you perception intimidation investigation  sam yeah theres a little dot next to it  taliesin investigation and survival also  liam arcana insight investigation  matt well as you look up first off as yasha 
none	 holds the torch up so you can see the symbols  marisha oh shit  laura what this is intricate  marisha look how cool  sam what are they theyre all over the ceiling  marisha yeah  liam i have that kids toy that makes these you spin it and the little pen goes around and around  laura are all those facing towards fjord  matt all of these are from fjords perspective  sam those are on the ceiling  matt those are on the ceiling yes  sam let me just check for traps  
none	 im going to walk around the immediate area checking for traps 22  matt 22 as you slowly crawl your way around the exterior checking the stone checking the  placement you do see that each of these symbols are about maybe half an inch thick into there  except for the centerpiece which you cannot tell how deep it is the hole in the center goes down  for a while from what you can tell  marisha you said this was pretty big  matt its about two to two and a half feet  to each side 
none	  laura on the ground just on the ground  matt yeah flat on the ground  sam no traps  matt you do not see any traps around the interior of the chamber  liam something was giving off an arcane aura before we came in here but i cannot see it now  so if you indulge me and give me ten minutes i will  sam ten minutes  liam yeah  laura yeah take your time  marisha can i do a check to see if i recognize any of these things  matt are you 
none	 trained in arcana  marisha i can use my mystical erudition to spend a ki point  matt i will say because of your monk background i will allow you to go ahead and attempt it as  well if the two guys trained in arcana as well are looking up at the symbols and studying them  you are welcome to do so  marisha i get advantage on this  matt if you spend a ki point yes you do  laura are the symbols just painted on the ground or are they carved into the ground  
none	 matt those symbols are carved in the ground those symbols on the ceiling of each space  laura theyre on the ceiling  matt theyre on the ceiling in each octagonal piece of the dome theyre painted above in a  circle around  travis 21  liam 16  marisha 18  matt okay in the focus of intending to cast the detect magic spell youre not as focused on the  symbols however the two of you keenly together staring up at the ceiling begin to make  out something similar in these patterns you dont fully understand 
none	 it as it comes from whatever  knowledge was imparted upon you from this entity youve made a pact with you however in studying  various forms of the arcane and coming into knowledge that isnt your specialty but knowing  it is definitely a specialty you look at each of these symbols and these are not classically used  theyre improvised interpretations or specific retoolings of the symbols that mean each of the  eight schools of magic between fjord and beau you guys get to make out what each of these  symbols means  travis oh shit 
none	  marisha cool  travis so i dont know why i know this  marisha yeah its like magic people code  travis yeah  marisha the people i learned from were super into this shit  laura does that mean we have to cast some spells or something  marisha i think its a puzzle i feel like this thing rotates and we have to match the symbols on  the bottom to the symbols that match the school of magic it feels like the divination is a full  symbol of the star  travis it feels like 
none	 the triangle is down here  marisha evocation right then the diamond  liam you can tell if you were to rotate it it would line up triangle to triangle that would  bring the star to that one there  marisha what would the diamond be  liam theres a diamond right there  sam does it look like it goes inside  matt you can give it a shot if you want to  sam ill go gingerly touch the base and see if it moves a little bit  matt it does not shift at all  
none	 travis is anyone on the platform  matt currently no  laura i wonder if you have to stick something in the hole and twist it  marisha i bet theres a key  liam caleb is still going through the ritual  matt okay  travis fuck it ill stand up on the platform  matt okay you step onto the platform a moment passes two no effect  travis can i look down into that black hole in the center of it  matt you can although in the light source yashas currently holding it just looks like 
none	 shadow  ashley do you want it  travis i have darkvision oh yeah ill take the torch  matt okay you take the torch and hold it over to give you a better glance over it the hole  descends about a foot and a half and stops  laura stick your wang in it  travis i will put my finger in the hole actually i dont know how big the hole is but i  want to feel if there are any grooves on the inside or any sort of indentations  matt right its roughly a 
none	 half inch wide so about that wide  travis i put my little pinkie in it  matt fits inside  travis solid walls  matt solid walls on the inside  travis well its short there anything around here that looks like a staff or a pole or rod  marisha im going to start looking around digging seeing if i see anything that looks like  it would fit the shape im also going to shout out be careful the shifty three were talking  about an octagonal room where they got attacked  travis the floor around 
none	 this triangle shape its flush in the ground right theres no circle  around the triangle platform  matt correct it is just flush and set in the ground  travis so the grounds not going to move maybe the ceiling has to move  laura oh because of the thing in the middle  travis right were not going to be able to turn the floor  sam how do we turn a ceiling  marisha maybe weve got to go all the way back up to the top  taliesin thats my thought  sam the top of 
none	 what  marisha the spiral staircase  ashley to see from the top  marisha we need a down here team and an up here team and maybe a frumpkin to communicate through  liam well i will remember this i have a perfect memory i will remember this exactly  laura does the pillar coming out of the ceiling have a hole in it as well  matt make a perception check  sam shes good at finding holes  laura i am really good at finding holes  liam she talks about them a lot  laura yeah 
none	 20  matt glancing up at it the pillar itself comes down in a squareshape and the very base of it  has a slight curvature or dome to it but it is solid you dont see any seams in it you dont  see any marking it is just a solid pillar its about ten feet wide or so  liam has ten minutes gone by yet  matt at this point yeah as they began to look around you said youre searching for anything  else in the chamber  marisha that looks like it would fit in 
none	 the rod  matt make an investigation check  marisha okay  matt as you begin to slowly make your way around the room looking for any markings  ashley i feel like that goes in the hole  laura but the hole is  sam this wide  laura yeah the hole is  matt the hole is like a halfinch wide  marisha okay 16  matt you spend a little while looking for any signs of grooves or where anythings hidden the  chamber is solid and there is nothing in the room that looks like it 
none	 would theres nothing to grab  on to there are no other objects in here its fairly empty aside from this dome that octagonal  shape and this small engraving on the ground and that pillar at the top  travis caleb do you have anything to draw these symbols  sam wait jester draws great jester can draw  travis oh yeah jester please both of you yeah just to get a rendition of the ceiling in  relation to the ground  laura i open up my sketchbook and i start drawing the symbols here look i made 
none	 this beautiful picture  marisha you work so fast  laura well im really talented  taliesin you dont have a heal cantrip do you  laura cantrip no  ashley i have some potions  liam did detect magic reveal what was glowing in here before  matt no this chamber is far further below its 40 feet below where you guys initially came  through so whatever you sensed earlier would have been near where you entered  liam oh it was just the glow stick  matt it was probably the glow stick yeah  travis i 
none	 think maybe we need to see where those stairs go up  marisha the stairs are back through the hall and up right theyre not in these chambers its one  big chamber  matt nope one big chamber with no other exit beyond the hallway you entered from  marisha all right ill jog up the stairs  travis wait youre going to wait until she disarms the  sam this is my chance for redemption  marisha oh sorry  sam let me break the traps first  marisha get it girl  travis marisha and ashley singing 
none	 get it girl get it get it girl  marisha singing to the front to the side to the back disarm that trap  sam can i have a handful of ball bearings  taliesin i hand nott a handful of ball bearings  sam thank you ill start working on it im going to disarm trap three  matt go for it  sam 19 plus stuff  matt oh yeah the next trap you come up to you leap up onto the side using your fingers to dig  into some of the holes there and jam about 
none	 three ball bearings into the one hole that you see is  the one where the bolt is actually embedded within and as soon as you step back down you  hear this grinding noise and the trap is pretty shattered from the inside  sam okay im going to go to trap one ooh not as good six plus six right 12  matt 12 the middle one is still broken theres only three platforms youve seen that actually  lead to this trap youve broken two of them the third and final one you go to attempt to 
none	 put the  ball bearing in there  sam oh boy  matt however it does shoot forth through your thumb thats going to be a 21 to hit  sam oh yeah that hits  matt you take eight points of piercing damage  travis redemption is fucking painful  matt actually it goes through your thumb and into your hand and into your wrist and so youre  bolted through there and its sticking out right there and youre like shocked sounds the shock  hits you you dont feel the pain yet youre looking at it jutting 
none	 through your hand  sam heavy breathing  taliesin we can fix that  sam while its reloading im going to jam some ball bearings in with my other hand and try to  break it  matt okay go for it roll one more time  sam nine  taliesin is that including the bonus  sam yes  taliesin wow  matt youre having a hard time breaking it you hear the clicking going and youre putting the  ball bearings and they keep slipping back out and you cant find the right way to keep it in 
tavern	  you have too much pain from your hand  liam shes too drunk  sam what else i got  matt ping another one fires out towards you thats going to be a 13 to hit  sam misses  matt so you duck out of the way you attempt to jam it back in  sam frustrated growl im going to try one more time natural 20  cheering  matt angrily with your one good hand you take a handful of bearings and jam them inside holding  your wrist there as you can feel the impact 
none	 inside and then a spring breaks somewhere beneath  the stone all three traps have been disabled  liam sorry 826  sam relieved panting all clear  taliesin oh well done with oh my god your hand  sam its fine its nothing its fine its just a little blood  taliesin thats ugh  liam you want to deal with that right away  sam pained groaning  marisha hey can i keep that i think i can throw it later  liam yeah here you go  marisha thank you thanks nott  taliesin did you just 
none	 pocket a thumb  sam no thats the bolt  marisha oh sorry heres your thumb back i just want the bolt  liam big lebowski  travis you want a toe i can get you a toe  matt as youre bleeding profusely from your wounded hand you guys head up the stairway  marisha yeah whos going up  liam well heres what i think i can send these little globules of light quite a ways and i can  also send frumpkin quite a ways so why dont we let frumpkin have a look and we just 
none	 hang back  taliesin i think lets all head up in that direction but put frumpkin first i think  frumpkin ahead but lets  travis ten feet ahead is fine  marisha i have a feeling theres going to be a levery or a movey situation  taliesin were also going to have to keep checking for traps and then well send people down  when we need it  marisha yeah you might need opposable thumbs  sam hey its too soon  marisha sorry  travis yeah we start heading up with frumpkin ten feet in front 
none	  liam lets say 30 feet in front of the group with one of my dancing lights about ten feet behind  her him him  matt him its your pet  sam wait so whos going up  travis everybody  sam but whos going to be downstairs to  taliesin well weve got to figure out what we  liam its all right jester drew it i remember it were good  matt marching order heading upstairs  marisha ill take the front  liam ill take second position  taliesin ill take third  ashley ill take 
none	 back  matt yashas in the back with frumpkin up ahead perfect as you guys progress spiraling up the  staircase you come by the glowing purple orb thats embedded in the wall and youre helping  caleb come up the stairs vision currently focused through frumpkin frumpkin heads above curling  upward another 60 or so feet above where you entered so 100 feet above spiraling where this  base floor you had already inspected was eventually it emerges into a fairly wide  squarelooking chamber  liam looking for dangerous shit  matt all right frumpkin emerges and 
none	 looks inside its a baroquestyle grand chamber with  intricate designs and a beautiful interior the floor itself is solid marble squares that are  offcolor to each other and give almost a checkered pattern to it against each wall the  walls are carved to be beautifully intricate with halfpillars carved out of them and parts that  are inset with art pieces once were set but are gone there are shelves in places in here where  things of worth were once set but have already been taken the opposite side of the room by the  way 
none	 has completely fallen in this chamber should be about 80 feet across but it looks like  something has happened and caused it to collapse inward and the chamber is slightly tilted to one  side theres a slight tilt a decline towards the lefthand side of the chamber there are two  loadbearing pillars that mark the center of the chamber that lead up to the ceiling and the  ceiling itself is about 30 feet up similar height to the previous chamber you were in make a  perception check for frumpkin  liam for me through frumpkin 
none	 is terrible seven  matt with the low light in the chamber its hard to make out any of specific details beyond that  but this is what you can see the collapsed opposite side of the chamber that has fallen in  and there is rubble and stone and earth that has filled the opposite side of the chamber there is  the nice marble floor and the designs and carvings in the sides of it  travis is there any sort of door at the top of the stairs that leads into this chamber or is it  
none	 just open  matt it just opens up the spiral staircase just emerges into that chamber  liam knowing distance space the direction of north at all times with frumpkin in there am i  able to tell how far back we are from this chamber were 20 feet back  matt you guys are about 15 20 feet behind frumpkin yeah  liam would you say that detect magic is still cooking at this point are we still under the ten  minutes from when i cast in the other room  matt youre getting close to the tip 
none	 of it to the end of it  liam am i sensing anything  laura snickers  ashley just the tip of it  liam find one thing youre good at in life and do it for the rest of your life  laughter  laura im sorry  matt so what are you doing  liam im going to scooch well no im with beau so im asking if i sense anything of arcane nature  matt nothing in the vicinity of the spiral staircase no  liam a retroactive question no never mind  matt okay  sam 
none	 im going to pop a healing potion  laura oh i can help you you want me to heal you  sam i mean i dont want to impose but im bleeding profusely  laura im going to cast cure wounds  matt level one  laura yes  ashley she cast it on me too  laura i did it on you too so thats seven points of healing for you  ashley tight  matt seven points for nott okay cool  laura does that help  sam it helps  taliesin still 11 down  matt are 
none	 you guys staying in the staircase or are you emerging into the chamber  travis im walking in  matt so you all begin to make your way inside this chamber  liam anything arcane before it dips out  matt nothing arcane in nature that catches your attention immediately in a 30 foot distance are  you heading into the chamber  liam no im behind beau  matt okay behind beau at the entrance way you dont feel any arcane presence the rest of you  begin to push past and make your way into the chamber and 
none	 once again you see  marisha any ghosty globbies  laura yeah ill looking for willowisps  matt thatd be perception checks from both you guys with yashas torch and the globes you have  there you dont have disadvantage  liam im dropping frumpkin vision  marisha natural 20  laura yes thats real good  matt natural 20 you  laura seven  liam youre also good  matt okay you notice a couple things  marisha okay  matt one there is a relief in the center of the chamber right before the wall collapse covers the 
none	  floor built into the marble it resembles two faces and one body in the center like one torso  leads into two faces that look upward their eyes are gone theres circular empty sockets where the  faces are and their emotionless expressions looking upward very thinly carved into the ground  marisha on the ground  matt yeah looking from above you can see it but looking from the side it looks very strange  because its a very flat carving you see that in the center ahead in the chamber  marisha okay are they like profiles 
none	 or are they front  matt no theyre looking straight up theres two sockets to each and theyre empty  marisha looking up deadless okay copy  laura deadless  marisha and travis lifeless  matt yes deadless deadlifts yes theyre looking up from the deadlifts its  marisha sorry absorbing a lot at once keep going  matt you do look to the right and left hand sides of the chamber you can see all the shelves and  inset areas where artwork would have been placed you do see two upside down acornstyle alcoves  that are mirroring 
none	 each other on each side of the chamber  laura does that look like that shape  matt from this distance you cant see theyre open theyre maybe about a foot tall and empty in  the inside with the light source you have at the moment you cant see anything inside of them  looking above you you do see a set of chains that are hanging from the ceiling that appear to be  affixed to some sort of red clay urn or vase that is dangling above  marisha i relay all of that of course  
none	 matt looking across the way in the rubble because you rolled a natural 20 you see a faint  glimmer of something metallic that catches the light of the torch occasionally as yasha moves  back and forth  liam you point that out as well  marisha i do  liam off of her first comment i would send one of the globules floating up to the ceiling to better  illuminate what shes pointed out  matt okay it looks to be some sort of vase or urn that is dangling from chains about 30 feet up  
none	 laura how big  matt its about that tall the full container its like a reddish clay color to it it looks  fairly well made but nothing ornamental per se its dangling from a chain on each side the light  lifts around it to inspect and reveal its coloration  liam was that 30 feet above us is there any space between the ceiling and the container  matt about a foot foot and a half theres not much distance its affixed to the ceiling right there  marisha and we can see it sorry  liam no 
none	 youre good  marisha we can see a closer of the dome with the symbols on them  matt theres no dome in here  marisha oh were not there yet sorry were just up the spiral staircase  matt youre starting to enter the chamber and there is no ceiling shapes or anything that  resemble the previous chamber you were in it comes to a there is a slight curve to where the  marisha im assuming its through the collapsed tunnel right okay got it  liam something metallic in the rubble vase above  matt correct 
none	 and the two alcoves in the sides the two pillars that are load bearing in the  center of the chamber  laura do you want me to throw something up at the vase and try to knock it over  travis no lets see whats on the other side of the room first  liam just to clarify your description the container is being held from above  matt correct it is dangling from the ceiling  liam chains coming down or no two chains from the ceiling  matt just two chains from the ceiling that are holding 
none	 it in place  marisha that feels like that might be a trap  sam yes  travis cool i start walking towards the other side of the room  matt okay fjord you walk through the relief on the ground ahead of you and there is that weird  source of metallic reflection that beau had seen from across the way  liam im going to scoot up behind fjord and see if i can detect any arcane anything before the  spell sniffs out  matt okay in the final throes of the spell the source of that 
none	 metallic shine does give a faint  arcane magical aura before the spell fades  liam what kind was it  matt for that one it would be abjuration  liam yeah  sam im going to scoot around the side and see if i can peek into those holes those reliefs in the walls  matt the alcoves  sam alcoves  matt okay you head over to the side alcove make an investigation check  sam 16  matt 16 you glance up inside its about three and a half feet off the ground and you have to 
none	  climb and scurry up with your small goblin body looking inside there is another clay urn of the  same red color thats set about a foot and a half inside  laura im going to get down on the ground  sam i will inform the others  taliesin im going to go check out the other alcove  matt the other alcove also contains a similar clay  taliesin three red urns  liam i catch fjord by the arm be careful whatever is under there is something of  protection something to keep us out or 
none	 to protect something  travis the little metallic glimmer that we saw can we see  matt as you approach you can see buried in some of the rubble a long brass or bronze rod of some  kind you only see about a foot of it sticking out from under the rubble  laura ayyyy theres a rod  travis about a half inch in diameter would you call it  matt you get a little closer and look down at it it looks like it would be about a half inch in  diameter yeah  ashley what 
none	 was underneath the urn in the ceiling on the ground  matt on the ground theres nothing directly below it  laura where are the faces on the ground  matt you walk up to the faces  laura yeah  matt you go over and sit over it and you can see a well carved robed figure male on one side and  female on the other but the same features like two sides of the same coin similar hairstyle no  coloration to it but a white marble relief on the ground the torsos merge and extend on 
none	 the two  sides and they both sort of look up with the emotionless face and where the eyes are they are  vacant circular holes about that big  marisha ooh all of them  matt as you get closer and look where the holes are vacant its only about maybe a quarter inch deep  laura whoa  matt so they dont go fully below theyre like a quarter of an inch deep  laura should i stick something in these eyes  sam maybe  ashley is there any way to see what is in the urns 
none	 like just have a peeksies  matt you come towards the urn you have to pull it out slightly to look into it because the  interior is too hard to see from this point  sam im going to get my crossbow ready to fire  matt okay  ashley can i just with my sword just a little  matt sure you take your sword and wedge it out it shifts forward a little bit and you look  inside it looks like there is ash in the urn its only about halfway full make a perception check 
none	  ashley uhoh seven  matt all you see is ash inside the urn  ashley i think its trash  travis these are trash urns  ashley yeah  sam why would they put trash urns in these weird  ashley its garbage  travis can i try and move some of the rubble off of the bronze rod  matt sure start shifting some of the rock make a strength check this would be athletics to do  this athletics sorry  travis okay i think thats a 15  matt okay you start shifting and pull the 
none	 rocks off the rod begins to coil you start moving it  and you pull and manage to pull it free from the stone some of the rocks falling down and  stumbling to the side you pull out a four and a half foot long rod that is straight towards the  bottom for about a foot and then is in a tight coil to the very top where there is a small  metallic knob at the very top you pull it forth and it vibrates a little from the impact of  pulling it out from under 
none	 the stone and then it comes to still in your hand  travis does it wobble  matt a little bit very faintly  travis does it make any noise  matt no  travis if i swing it harder does it  laura dont break it  matt you start swinging it it makes a air whipping sound as you swing it around  liam i think i would have noticed that the circus bouncer looking in the urn did not get blown up  but also looked a little puzzled so im going to go over and take 
none	 a look at the same thing  taliesin im going to take a look at the other one  matt okay as you go to look in the other urn you glance over at the urn that yasha was turned  away from and you see this glowing fire emerge from the urn in her direction just this small  glowing orb begin to shift out of the urn right towards her back  sam am i ready to fire  matt you are you get to make an attack  taliesin im going to start with one of my 
none	 blades  matt go for it  sam okay im going to shoot a crossbow bolt at that fire  matt go for it  sam natural 20  matt oh shit and that is a 19 against you yasha  ashley okay wait yeah okay  matt okay do your damage  sam okay is this sneak attack or no i dont even know what this creature is  liam yasha is right next to it  ashley do i get a saving throw  matt no saving throw but you do take 13 points of lightning damage  
none	 ashley im going to die  sam i deal 16 points of damage  laura wait do you double it because its a critical  taliesin yeah  sam i dont know  liam the dice are doubled not your modifiers but the dice  sam wow okay thats 28 points of damage  ashley thats better  matt 28 points of damage all right  sam all the dice are doubled  liam yeah  sam good god  matt so you actually take no damage because he was holding his reaction and as soon as it  emerges 
none	 he fires you watch as the orb dissipates the faint little motes of energy  shift and vanish on the outside of the urn  taliesin im looking at the other urn is anything happening  matt you watch as another one begins to slowly emerge and another begins to emerge from the  ceiling i need you all roll initiative  marisha here we go  sam shouting no time to thank me  ashley thank you  sam shouting no no time  taliesin oh my god really  ashley oh my god  liam i got another 
none	 one for 826la  taliesin i rolled the same initiative this is the worst initiative ever  matt you got yasha off to this side going this way nott youre not too far from there molly  you were off to the opposite side to look to the other edge caleb where were you  liam i was where yasha was i went over to look at her urn  matt thats right so you were over by yasha fjord you were over by where you found the  object frumpkin was   liam frumpkin would have been just 
none	 15 feet into the chamber  matt okay and then beau and jester where are you placed  marisha i would be probably be in between fjord and caleb  laura i was wherever those bodies where because i was kneeling down and looking at them  matt right so that would be this relief right here by fjords all righty and you watch as  molly actually molly was making his way over there as this happened and that one emerged  laura it look like lightning corn on the cob  matt another one shifts out of the 
none	 urn that you just had one emerge from  sam its my own urn  matt that nott has destroyed it dissipated then the small motes fwoosh back into the urn  laura oh no its like never ending  ashley now that i know its there  laura its not a surprise at least  ashley not a surprise  matt so going for initiative here folks 25 to 20  marisha 22  sam 22  matt oh wow all right so we have nott and beau all right 20 to fifteen  travis 17  matt 17

none	  liam they vanish theyre gone theyre fucking ghosts  taliesin im trapped in that well never mind damn it  laura arent willowisps like kids arent they the spirits of children  marisha is that true  sam is that true oh god that is awful  laura thats what i learned in quest for glory shadows of darkness  matt you would know this but its different from story to story its not necessarily the case  here so the three willowisps come back into visual range and ones going to be attacking  molly one against nott 
none	 and one against beau  marisha copy  matt the one against beau is going to be thats a nine  marisha nein miss  matt thats a miss on you it goes wide theres going to be one attacking you molly that is  going to be an 18 to hit  taliesin oh that hits  matt that is eight points of lightning damage against you against you nott that is a 22 to  hit you take 12 points of lightning damage as these willowisps reach out and strike you  theres a burst of energy as 
none	 electricity strangely like undead lifesucking energy  electricity begins to shoot through your body you feel your muscles tense your teeth and your jaw  clench and you break away and regain composure for a moment but they seriously hurt you with a  brief gliding by your essence for the rest of their movement this one is going to shift around  this way this one is going to go ahead and shift this way this one is going to go ahead and move  right there to melee move fjord all right first up we have nott and 
none	 beau  marisha okay you want to go first girl  sam sure i will shoot towards cocking sound is the one near molly engaged with molly  matt it is yes  sam okay i will shoot at the one next to molly not good 12  matt 12 does not hit unfortunately you fire towards and it swooshing sound just dodges out  of the way completely avoids the bolt as it ricochets off the stonework in the distance  sam cocking sound fire again bonus action not much better 15  matt 15 it manages to arc 
none	 out of the way of the other one both bolts go wide from where its  position is striking the stone no effect  laura 15 didnt hit them  marisha 15 didnt did you try to shoot it  sam twice  matt nott are you going to move or stay there for your turn  sam no im engaged right  matt yes  sam im going to say shouting help me im going to die im going to die  matt beau while this is happening what are you doing  marisha okay seeing nott have a

none	 hand and palm in its face  matt youre not proficient with it but its still your dex to hit with it  marisha 12  matt a 12 okay that pulling out a book here thank you for your patience singing holy water  marisha is it a dex saving throw  matt thats a ranged attack against the target creature yeah no you try to smash it but it  ducks out of the way because youre smashing it it doesnt hit the ground and shatter so you  still have it your hand but you swing with 
none	 it to try to break it over this entity and it dodges  out of the way they are very quick  marisha okay do i still get my bonus attack  matt because it was a ranged attack sure its stretching it a little bit but i will let it happen  marisha natural 19 25  matt 25 does hit go ahead and roll damage  marisha eight damage  matt eight points of damage for that one nice  marisha do i punch a ghost  matt you do hit it but it doesnt take as much 
none	 damage as you would expect as you swing toward  it it gives resistance to your fist and numbs it as you punch through it it does react to the  impact but its not quite as impactful as you hoped a swing that strong should have been  marisha okay  liam you punched cotton candy  matt you did kind of stinging cotton candy  marisha a little cold  matt does that finish your turn  marisha yep  matt all righty finishing beau and notts go fjord youre up  travis i got a question you 
none	 said ten minutes on the boat as we were moving forward ten minutes  for him to cast detect magic and another ten minutes for detect magic to run out so its been  about a half an hour  matt id say with searching around everything its been closer to 45 minutes  travis okay great so my armor of agathys is still up  matt your armor is still up  travis so can i bonusaction hex the glob the wispy thing right next to me  matt sure there we go  travis nice  matt youve 
none	 hexed it  travis great can i take swipe at it with the wastehunter blade  sam wastehunter  travis wastehunter that is 15 to hit  matt 15 to hit you hex it and as you swing your blade swooshing sound it shimmies out of the  way its light moves with sudden rapid haste as soon as you try to strike towards it and dodges  the blow entirely  travis wow can i use all of my 30 foot walking speed to run towards the door there where we came  out of  matt all right

none	 blade you cut it halfway through the air the actual urn bisects sending ash clouding  into the air around you and you watch as the willowisp pfft  sam oh why dont we do that with all of them  marisha nice thats what we do  travis nice dude nice  matt the urn clatters to the ground the top of it breaks the second half hits with a heavy thud  sound thats different from the sound of the clay that shatters on the ground that finishes your turn  taliesin other than that im going to 
none	 take a look at it down below to see if theres anything in  there thats weird  matt ill say you have to wait until next round you reach around and finish that whirling dervish action  laura i should have thrown something at the vase  sam yeah  matt caleb youre up  liam caleb does what that bearded dude in the gif does going seeing that happen and i cast  scorching ray myself and i will send one ball of fire at the next pot  matt all righty  taliesin the one on the

none	 top half of it to detonate the bottom half of the clay cracks and  the bottom still remains in place the ash clouding out of it the one  liam so that did not get destroyed then it got damaged  matt this willowisp flickers out it had been heavily damaged already and that amount of  scattering of the ash caused it to flicker and disintegrate the bottom of the urn is still  holding itself in place the top half scattered and broken  liam that was just one so i continue to wrap my hand around 
none	 and a second one shoots out at the  one in the ceiling that is a natural 18  matt that hits roll damage on that one  liam yeah that is an eight  matt eight it shatters and breaks the ash comes clouding down like the slight drizzle of soft dust  and ash this willowisp vanishes into the space  travis ugh its in my eyebrows  liam the other one shoots up in the air and lands two feet behind me just goes explosion  sam whoa so cool  matt as youre threepoint landing there 
none	 caleb  liam no im standing  matt standing but hurling a laughter as you stand there the explosion behind from the  scorching ray as the bottom half of the urn from the ceiling tinging rolling  liam oh shit thats hot  sam that was amazing  taliesin im going to pick up the bottom half of that and im going to examine immediately what  ive got  matt all right and well come back to that after our break because its just after nine oclock so  well take a quick break here and be back

none	 okay we can keep going  travis were still resting  ashley still garbage  matt you and molly are doing this if i recall before we entered the break the base of each urn  the lower half of it is actually a metallined bottom looking on the inside as you scoop out  the ash blowing get it to empty the space you can see very faintly on the inside of the metal  very faint carvings matching the symbols you have seen in the previous room  sam oh shit  laura which room lets take the 
none	 piece of metal down wait does each of the urns have a different one  matt each of the urns has all eight symbols in it  laura oh  liam at this point we should be able to see the things that the very perceptive people saw which  was two faces eyes with holes in them in the middle  matt yes  liam in this room  laura yeah  liam should we do it in this room  travis are the eye holes about the size of gold coins  matt roughly  travis ill take

none	  travis he always gets his due  liam mama put the coins in my eyes because i sure do not believe what i am seeing  travis thats an eight  matt thats an eight  sam as he falls i throw a piece of feather and i cast feather fall on him  marisha holy shit thats awesome  matt thats a reaction whats the range on that  sam 60 feet  matt yeah youre fine fjord suddenly begins to disappear the floor going out underneath this  looks of fear comes over his eyes as nott 
none	 barely releases the spell in time and fjord goes from  plummeting to gently falling you glide down and you look down below you into the darkness you  descend ten 15 20  marisha beau hollers out hey i think you figured out that puzzle  taliesin we should probably put a light in there  liam caleb doesnt say anything or move at all but hes thoroughly impressed with nott by the way  travis yep me too  matt about 30 feet down you see something rapidly coming up below you looks like a floor or  
none	 a surface though it is somewhat amorphous and jumbled that it looks hard to see any sort of  shape to it  travis are things moving  liam i will send two of my globules down after him  matt okay with your low light vision looking down below eventually your feet land its soft  and crunchy as your feet land you glance down and the smell gets you immediately its a heavy smell  of decay of dust and ash you look down below and your are sunken into a pile of longrotting  clothing occasionally your 
none	 foot hits something that cracks and you can see some charred bones  that remain within  laura charred  matt yes  taliesin this is how they clean the room  liam how far down is that does everybody see  matt its about 3035 feet down  ashley im going to take a rope out of my bag and wrap it around a pillar  matt okay you take it and tie it off to the side  laura fjord do you see anything cool down there  travis yeah theres a bunch of old clothes it smells 
none	 awful down here  laura does anybody have weapons or coins on them  travis i havent really looked i still got this damn bronze rod with me too so i got to find my  way out of here  laura well get you out just look for something cool though  ashley can i throw the torch down there  matt yeah as you  ashley fjord  matt you hear your name and you look up just as the torch  travis okay  matt you reach up and try and grab it catch it fumbling  
none	 marisha let it fall  travis falls in the clothes i start burning alive  sam a rope  liam yeah  taliesin we already have a rope down  ashley i put a rope down  travis can i look around see if there are any weapons or objects  matt make an investigation check  liam caleb is travelling down the rope that yasha dropped  travis oh thats great natural 19 thats a 21  matt 21 you guys hear the sound of shifting and clattering of material and bonelike objects  against each other and the 
none	 stone side of the chamber you fjord begin to pour through youre  tugging through the clothing thats here has been slowly rotting over time the material coming  apart as you pull it apart you see the tunics and the pantaloons and all the different pieces  of clothing that are in here pull apart almost as your fingers go into it theres no remaining  flesh the decay smell is not fresh decay its old stagnant long past sealed decay as you pull  through you do find some pieces of silver and gold jewelry theyre tucked in 
none	 pockets of some of  this clothing you can see one skeletal wrist that has this really nicelooking bracelet with a chain  that goes around the center finger but the bone is snapped off and the bone itself is still charred  black around most sides only a little bit of grayish white peeks through in places as you rub  your finger over it there are some pieces of jewelry here thats probably worth a little bit of  money because you rolled that high you also pull through in one of the pockets you can see a 
dung	  small leather case about that wide with the lid thats burnt as you pull it it tears off  entirely looking inside theres a very thin diamond shaped vial you pull it out and shake it  it has a stopper on it that looks either a rubber or a coated cork that is buttoned on one side that  is built into the actual crystal containers cap you watch it swish around holding the torch up  to it it has a brackish dark brownblack tint to it like thick sludge pond water  liam i wouldve gotten 
none	 down the rope at this point and seeing fjord examine that i cast  detect magic instantly  matt okay it is definitely magical  liam okay what kind  ashley and laura what kind  liam im allowed to know its in the book  laura you can ask nicely  matt i would say abjuration  liam whats in the fucking potion matt  matt you have to identify it to find out  travis okay ill take some of the nice jewelry and stuff like that and the little vial are there  any other doors or 
none	 entrances or shoots  matt no it ends here there is a pit and you finally reached the bottom after pulling through  youve probably gone through about 40 or so equivalent outfits  liam does detect magic uncover anything else besides what hes already looking through  matt no just the vial that he discovered  laura everybody else was resting up top while  taliesin oh yeah short rest  maisha ooh can we do that  matt if you guys want to take a short rest about an hour or so to take a moment and take 
none	 a  breather use your hit dice  liam oh an hour  laura its okay because i dont get my spells back with rests so thats really good that i used  it and everything  sam i appreciate it  liam fjord hold that up for me so i can tell you what it is i will spend the next 10 minutes with  fjord sitting in front of me and me looking at it and doing the ritual  matt well you guys havent taken a short rest yet theyre taking a short rest you can go 
none	  upstairs if you want to  liam you want to rest first or do you want me to tell you what it is now  travis you can tell me what it is now  liam okay so 10 minutes that takes identify  matt all right that is a potion of necrotic resistance  liam well i dont have it you have it  travis when you drink this potion you gain resistance to necrotic damage for one hour nice  cool  marisha whenever we get done with the short rest can beau start peeking through and 
none	 digging away at  the collapsed entrance into that tunnel  matt okay make an athletics check  sam i sewed my thumb back on  matt okay ten minutes pass you guys climb back up out of the pit  travis yeah  matt okay you guys head up and join the rest of them are going to be resting for the next 45 or so  minutes you can join them if you want them to wait for you as well  travis id like to yeah  matt okay you guys complete a short rest as well 
none	 go for it  liam arcane recovery  matt while you guys are finishing that up beau is rummaging through the rubble  marisha it wasnt good six slow going  matt you spend about 30 minutes or so and you maybe get about two feet into the rubble and  youre not sure how far back it goes a lot of the stones now youre getting to are now too big for  you to move  marisha was there a little crawl space at the top that we could crawl through  matt no the ceiling caved in 
none	 on that side  marisha well its just me and i rolled shitty  matt all right you guys have all taken your time to short rest  sam weve also discovered that ashley has more dice than laura apparently  ashley no i dont  sam what is this what is this gigantic box of dice  ashley listen she has a whole duffel bag  sam yeah but she doesnt use those these are all active for tonight  ashley listen i like to have all my options  matt exactly  laura yeah  sam this is 
none	 terrible  ashley its not all my fault  taliesin i believe in you this is fine  ashley thank you  laura she needs better organization  ashley i need better organization  laura you got to divide them out  travis shall we make our way back downstairs to see what this rod does in the little hole  sam i thought we were supposed to turn the ceiling from up here no  taliesin how big are the bevels that have the relief of the 12  matt theyre about that big in the bottom and about 
none	 a heavy bowl size  laura i think the corkscrews going to stick in the hole and move the whole room or something  liam yeah the eyes were for uncovering all that death underneath our feet  marisha the ceiling is through here and its blocked by a bunch of rubble we can try and dig  through it if we think something should be up there  sam no we should use the stairs  marisha all right  matt so what are you guys doing  travis yeah were going to go back downstairs  laura we 
none	 can try to move some of the rubble  marisha ive been like small boulders ive been struggling  matt so youre taking the rod and you guys are heading downstairs  taliesin and the bowls  matt using the bowls as well okay you have the three urn vases  taliesin mmhmm clean them off a bit  liam fjord you can of course stick that thing in the hole in that bottom room if you want but  if you like my man schmidt could do it with little risk to the rest of us if you like 
none	  travis oh yeah give him a shot  liam we should all stand back better safe than sorry  laura do we know which way were turning everything now  travis taliesin and liam yeah  laura oh everybody knows it already  sam i dont know it seems like they know they decided without us  laura but why did you decide the way that youre saying it  liam well look here now that were back peering through the doorway at this we have this star on  that corner and if you would rotate we dont 
none	 know what were rotating is the thing  travis were hoping that well get it to turn  marisha if the thing goes two clicks correct it goes there  liam were saying thats the idea because theres a diamond to a diamond and a star to a star and  a triangle of dots to that triangle  laura yeah i like the way you guys think that sounds smart  sam so smart  liam well i bumped up to 20  laura so thats evocation you guys and divination and necromancy  liam edubation its critical  
none	 marisha so wait divination evocation necromancy  sam thats dead things good things and inbetween things  marisha and elemental things right isnt evocation  liam evocation is destruction  marisha fire lightning elemental things  matt you guys descend the staircase find your way to the base floor you head to the hallway  where you had previously disabled the traps and carefully step across each threshold without  issue they still remain disabled  sam i did that  matt you make your way into the central octagonal chamber what would you like to do  liam im 
none	 casting in an instant unseen servant schmidt is here with us  matt schmidt appears unseen  liam fjord hold out your magic whatsit there i command fjord to give that to schmidt schmidt  takes it  travis i refuse your command and i give it to schmidt willingly  liam the spell runs out  laughter  liam i ask schmidt to insert the spirally staff into the laura bailey hole in the center of the dais  matt you watch as the rod gingerly drifts over to the center place slips in locks into place  marisha 
none	 something bad might happen once we turn this so be on guard  liam it is true thats why were hanging back behind the door do we think we should go  clockwise or counterclockwise  travis counterclockwise  liam schmidt please revolve that staff counterclockwise please  matt nothing moves  liam well try it clockwise then schmidt  matt nothing moves  liam well thats a lot of bollocks then  laura maybe its got to be a real person maybe you have to cast a spell that has to do with the  class of magic  
none	 taliesin ive got an idea im going to start rocking upstairs  travis rocking upstairs  taliesin im walking upstairs  marisha im going to join molly i think someone needs to be upstairs you guys stay  matt molly you have the bowls right  taliesin i have the bowls  matt beau and molly head back up the stairs  taliesin im going to take a look at that purple is there only one of those little purple  glowing rocks that seems to be creating light  matt as you look going through you see there are 
none	 a few other stone cages that have been opened and  left empty that is one that has not been removed  taliesin im going to open it and i will im going to poke at it to see if it seems trapped or anything  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin all right  16  matt does not appear to be trapped  taliesin im going to open it and grab the stone out  matt make a strength check to try and wedge it from the stone its attached to  taliesin thats a six 
none	  matt grunting its not budging your lithe tiefling form is not quite sturdy enough to pull  it from the stone  liam dance it out of there  taliesin beau  marisha yeah  taliesin can you punch this  marisha i got you one better ill shove in my staff and push against the pillar and use it as  leverage see if i can pry it open  matt okay yeah ill give you that make a dexterity check finding the proper point of  leverage to push on  marisha ooh natural 18 22

none	 im going to put it in the room see if anything happens  matt no reaction  taliesin weve got these bowls im going to put the bowls gingerly im going to put one of the  bowls on one of the symbols to see what happens  matt okay which symbol  taliesin put it middle of the star  matt okay place it in the middle of the star the metal bowl sits there the fine engravings of  all the symbols on the inside of each bowl dont seem to react  taliesin im going to try 
none	 and move the bowl to match the engravings in the ceiling  matt okay you have three bowls and each bowl contains all eight symbols in the inside so its  hard to match them per se  laura cast a spell on one of the bowls  sam why dont we try a person to use the rod first before we start wasting spells  travis yeah okay ill walk up and ill grab the rod  sam youre weak shouldnt we use a strong person  matt the rod doesnt shift  travis it doesnt move  matt 
none	 you move it the other way and it comes out you have to put it back in and lock it into place  but it doesnt seem to shift or move  taliesin whats the the top of the rod again the top of that little spiral  matt its a small little metallic knob at the end  taliesin im going to examine it anything interesting about it just a small metallic knob  matt best you can look at it it doesnt have any markings on it or anything unique its just a  solid round knob end 
none	  taliesin like a lightning rod  matt something like that  sam yasha youre strong why dont you go try and twist the thing  ashley all right ill give it a try  matt you spend a good two minutes shifting on the rod the opposite direction where it locks no movement  travis do we think we need to cast unique spells into those bowls for each of the three schools of  magic which is what jester said  marisha we heard you  laura angrily no its fine  travis im trying to figure out 
none	 how do you cast necrotic damage on a bowl  laura i dont know i could inflict wounds on it or something or toll the dead on the bowl  travis you want to inflict wounds on one of them  laura well no im going to use a cantrip because its better so im going to toll the dead on  sam what is it evocation  laura necrotic divination and evocation so ill try to toll the dead on one of the bowls the  one that is sitting on the diamond  matt you cast toll the 
dung	 dead the dark arcane energy from toll the dead begins to gather around  the hand of jester and as you release the spell you watch this burst of necrotic energy siphon  back and immediately attach itself to the very top of this metallic rod  cheering  matt its absorbed and theres a moment of pause before you feel banging sound  taliesin lets do the other two  laura wait is it turning  matt you hear a shifting of stone this faint slithering sound begins to fill the chamber  travis other two or maybe not 
none	  matt the slithering stops booming you watch as your eyes catch something shift above you that  large square pillar that was locked in the ceiling that dome underneath it opened up and a  strange translucent cubelike creature comes descending from the center i need you guys all to  roll initiative  yelling  liam not a gelatinous cube  travis did we pick the form of our killer  liam a gelatinous cube  marisha wait but you did necromantic right  laura yeah  liam oh shit  sam wait if we had picked a

none	 begins to  slowly encapsulate your arm and forearm as it rises up and your arm is numb you shake your  head and cut out to the side and as you do you watch the side of it splash out almost like  popping a water balloon the interior of it turns to liquid water and begin to spill out as it  slowly deflates and liquefies across the ground like a jellyfish beached  travis oh im stepping in it  liam ashley you just destroyed a classic dungeons  dragons foe  clapping  matt ill tell 
none	 you one thing that restraint saved your fucking ass at the start it never got  to engulf never got a chance to engulf  travis ill run over and ill kneel down next to jester and pick up her head and pour a health  potion there  liam imitating jester put your tusk in there fjord  laughter  laura oh oskar  travis fjord  laura thank you for saving me  travis its fjord  laura sorry i mean fjord  travis yeah you all right  laura yes  travis okay get up come on

none	 thing again will  another one come out or do we need to try to hit all three at the same time let me come in there  matt actually i guess ill leave this here  liam leave it nearby  matt ill set it aside  marisha well if you hit all with everything at once then the worst that can happen is that we  have to fight two more things at the same time  liam well jester did necrotic and i can obviously handle well i can handle evocation or  laura who has divination 
dung	 though  matt what you didnt notice during this process was the pillar above the base reclosed  marisha so we have to do it all at once  liam i can do both divination and evocation  sam at the same time  liam can you do one of those things  sam i dont know you taught me magic what are mine what are my spells  liam well tell me what you are able to do  sam here ill show you on dd beyond  travis what are the last two divination and  liam divination 
dung	 and evocation  laura does anybody have one of those  sam most of mine are illusion and something else  liam yeah you can do evocation with this one  sam okay i can do evocation  liam but you have to get up there though you have to touch it with that one  laura can your mage hand lift you up  sam no but i can do climb  taliesin well we have to do it in the bowl  sam or we do it to the rod  travis to the bowl  liam so 
none	 you handle evocation i can handle the divination you handle necrotic  matt where are the bowls placed right now on the symbols in the center  sam in the hole  matt what are you doing  sam i can do shocking grasp as a evocation spell  laura wait i have an idea maybe we should take the bowls outside of the room and cast something  on the bowls and see if one of the symbols on the bowls light up that way the staff doesnt absorb  the spell immediately because when i cast toll the 
none	 dead i was trying to cast it on the bowl  right but instead my spell went up into the middle of the staff maybe if we try casting it on  the bowls outside of the room that wont happen  sam cant we cast it on the staff  taliesin there is a room outside this room where it seems like there was a room for maybe preparing  the bowls  travis yeah lets do that jester lead the way  liam it is worth a try of course it is  laura just so we dont 
none	 have to fight another cube just in case  liam im pretty good i have not let go all of my preparation for the day  laura how many points of healing did you give me when you poured the spell in my mouth  matt was it a regular healing potion  travis yeah just regular  matt 2d4 plus two  liam is everyone all right  travis six  liam jester how are you feeling  laura im feeling like im a little sick right now but you know  liam no not laura but you jester

none	 laughter  travis wubba lubba werbage  laura lets fucking go out into this hallway okay  travis yeah beau and i take the bowls we head out into the hallway  matt you guys head out past the traps carefully stepping across the currentlyheld traps and you  have the bowls in the far hallway  laura should we try casting a spell on one of the bowls and see what happens  travis yeah we lay all three of them one two three out in a row  liam necro evo and divination all together  travis evo 
none	 you first pick a bowl  sam wait no we have to do it instantaneously  laura no we dont i dont think so because were not in the room anymore so we can try to see  if the bowls do anything  liam do you think it would hurt if we did it at the same time  sam yeah whats the problem with that  travis sure try it well see what happens  liam lets do it at the same time  sam at the count of zwei  marisha beau takes off her belt  
none	 laura im going to cast my spare the dying cantrip  matt which is  laura necromancy  matt necromancy youre casting  sam shocking grasp  matt okay which is evocation  liam identify which is divination  marisha i take off my belt and i hold it up like a rally car racer girl  silence  travis were waiting  marisha three two one swishing  sam gibberish  matt you guys all cast your spells no effect on the bowls  sam we have to be in the room  matt its hard to see because 
none	 theres still the ash caked on the inside of it  laura wait i blow on the bowl does it look like any of the symbols got any brighter  taliesin i would say the one that i had i probably polished up  matt its very hard to see with very little light in here  liam okay that was good we checked that box so lets go back into the room  matt make an intelligence check  liam yeah okay  marisha come on  liam yeah thats good its 20  matt 20 very good there 
none	 is something bugging you in the back of your head something that says  the fact that these were urns that carried ash speaks to the purpose of these you cant make the  connection here but the fact that each of these were filled with ash is bugging you theres  something there  liam the urns currently are totally empty  matt theyre totally empty yes  sam why dont we cast it on the rod  liam i know i  laura do we need to set these on fire  liam we maybe need to go 
none	 upstairs and scoop some of the dustbuster bullshit into these and bring  them down  travis nott you want to go cast it on the rod lets go you and me well do it  laura you need three spells  liam no im saying we need to go collect some of the ashes of the dead from upstairs  travis or maybe we need to set them on fire  liam something is missing here  laura we need to set it on fire  ashley wait are they already filled with ash right now  matt the 
none	 ash has been mostly cleaned out  marisha i still have this holy water too  matt yeah you have your torch and you have your spells  liam its possible that we need to burn something afresh  laura hold the torch under one of the bowls  liam yeah i can set things on fire as well do you want to do one  laura just hold it under and see what happens  liam yeah its easier i cast firebolt into one of them  matt you cast firebolt into one of them the flame bursts in 
none	 there as you guys take the torch  over to the side as the fire subsides you see each of the symbols portions of them are left  glowing and slowly fade  marisha which ones which portions  matt all of them all the symbols have certain parts of them that just glow for a second in the  presence of fire and then fade  laura hold the torch under one of them for a long time and see what happens  matt whos going to hold the bowl  taliesin ill hold the bowl im resistant to 
none	 fire  matt you take the bowl and you hold it out there it hurts a little but as you hold the torch  underneath it begins to light up you watch as the symbols begin to glow on the inside of these  metal inscribed bits  taliesin look at this  laura woah here we go  sam so creepy  taliesin there we are  marisha yes  sam what parts of the symbols are glowing more  laura we were wrong about what we needed to cast  liam just to note schmidt is still here 
none	 with us if we need anyone to hold anything thats dangerous  laura thats that one  taliesin we need transmutation  laura what is this  taliesin thats  laura illusion we need an illusion  sam i know those  taliesin and we need enchantment  laura transmutation  taliesin illusion and enchantment  marisha and enchantment  laura i have an enchantment  liam i have transmutation  travis theres fine writing around the square thats not just a shape see this writing in here  sam i know an enchantment spell and an illusion spell

none	 we know what we need to know because of  these bowls i think we need all three of these versions of the spells placed in each of these points  marisha we put bowls no  laura we dont even need the bowls  sam one two three right there thats where we need to spin it over there  taliesin everybody stand at their point  laura wait i got to find my spell that actually does the thing that i said i could do  sam oh right there see that symbol matches with this one  
none	 taliesin sarcastically are you sure  sam i figured this out guys  laughter  laura wait i have enchantment  sam so what do you have  laura enchantment  taliesin we need transmutation and illusion  liam i have transmutation and enchantment  sam i have illusion and transmutation  liam and what do you have jester  laura i have enchantment  liam so youre enchantment that means i have transmutation  sam im illusion  marisha all right yes  taliesin if anything starts to happen i want you to run for the door  laura 
none	 okay ill go stand by the enchantment under the symbol for enchantment just in case  taliesin that would be the three dots  sam what about you fjord dont you have some spells on you why arent you helping out  travis what do you want  laura can you do enchantment  travis nope i got evocation i got necrotic  liam if another cube or something comes out  taliesin we need fighters  marisha me and fjord will stand by in case anything else drops out of the ceiling  liam thats right weve got these 
none	 two bruisers here thats good i concur  taliesin just in case im going to light my other sword too  matt flames mark your damage on that  sam where are we casting it upon  laura i think were casting it at the staff  sam all right  marisha yasha you want to take another point fighters and casters  ashley yep  travis oh my god im going to cast armor of agathys on myself again  laura do we need to be standing in front of the symbol that it lines up with  taliesin 
none	 i would stand in front of the symbols on the triangle personally  laura ill go stand in front of the three dots  marisha this was a research facility for mages theyre super uppity about this shit yeah  sam i go over next to the illusion one  liam i of course in front of transmutation  matt as you guys are triangulated around those specific coordinates youve set yourselves what  do you do  laura we count to three and we go  liam youre doing what im doing maximilians earthen grasp again with my cats 
none	 paw  laura im doing hold person  sam im taking a bit of fleece and doing some hand symbols and casting silent image  matt all right youre casting  laura hold person  marisha i pull off the belt again  ashley sword at the ready  marisha one two three  matt as the three of you complete your incantations the energy unleashed from the arcane  and divine schools of magic you watch as the energy disperses from the spell and all three go  sucking sound right into the center rod it sits there shimmering 
none	 from the impact you guys back  away and it slowly goes cold again on the opposite side of the chamber you hear grinding  and you watch as a false wall on the opposite end rotates open leading you to a hallway on the  opposite side that was previously closed  cheering  matt well done guys  laura oh man  travis i cast armor of agathys for nothing  matt you still got it for an hour  laura thats good because who knows what else well run into while were down here  marisha on 
none	 the other side  travis well im wearing it ill run over to the door  taliesin check for traps  liam wait i sit down and i start doing the ritual for detect magic again ten minutes  matt while hes doing that anybody else doing anything  travis im running over to the door im not crossing the threshold i just want to see i got darkvision  matt looking inside with what low light is coming through from the edges of yashas  torchlight the first thing that hits you is the smell its a strange combination 
dung	 of old decay  strong rust and burnt hair its hard to describe but its a very unpleasant mingling of  smells as it hits you looking inside you see a chamber ahead divided into three smaller sections  and a center main chamber area the center main chamber area is what you can most make out the  details of it looks like some sort of inert arcane circle in the center theres a symbol  drawn there with runes around but its currently cold and dark you cant see much further beyond  that because youre staying at 
none	 the doorway and to the right and left it looks theres two smaller  chambers immediately and then it goes further in  travis we got more magic stuff inside i know calebs meditating but its going to get hairy i  bet smells a little burnt hairy  ashley i walk up behind fjord  matt the torchlight extends into the chamber and you can see a little more now the two side  chambers are almost pillshaped theyre rounded at each side and theyre enclosed but open into  the center chamber at each of these rounded edges 
dung	 as you step inside and glance to the right  and left you can see cagelike contraptions iron domes that are very tightknit dark iron rusted  metal theyre on the edges of each side you see loadbearing pillars in the center of the chamber  to the right and left and cold braziers behind those against the walls little domed pieces of  stone that once contained flame for light across the way you can see two tables with chairs a  bookcase thats all you can see at this distance  travis the dome cages are solid steel 
none	 or are they bars  matt theyre bars but the bars are an inch inch and a half between each its very little space in between  taliesin im going to start heading in this direction too does one of them look like it was  possibly holding a gelatinous cube at some point  matt are you entering the chamber to look  travis yeah ill go with you  laura you should detect traps  sam all right ill look for traps i know its my job  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  liam 
tavern	 five more minutes  sam 13  matt best you can tell theres no traps in this first portion of the chamber  sam all clear i take another swig from my flask  matt okay how drunk are you right now  sam pretty drunk  matt well put you in the drunk status then  sam its been a long night  travis yasha molly want to come in  sam by the way yasha can i say you werent even with us yesterday and now youre down here  doing this is this crazy what were you

none	 chamber you are now stepping into the  center of this inert magical circle with the two cold braziers and the pillars you see the four  cages on the two opposite ends of the rounded pillshaped side rooms and across the way there  is the bookcase and the two tables as you get closer and see theres two nonlit candelabra  what faint bits of candle remnants are there are mostly melted and the wax dripping off and  causing small pools in the ground but theyve been cold for some time  travis i go over to 
none	 one of the cages  liam did we wait the short amount of time for detect magic  marisha i am inbetween you and them and im going come on come on  travis i go over to one of the cages the nearest left one  matt perception check  travis 14  matt you glance through with the light thats flickering through the various gaps in this iron  cage and inside you can see a similar clay urn deep red sitting in the center you see burnt and  tattered clothing at the sides of it  
none	 travis oh jeez got another urn here full of ash  laura be careful  sam kill it break it  travis anyone want to check the other cages make sure its not the same thing in each  taliesin ill go take a look at the other cage  ashley ill go look at another one  matt you glance make a perception check  laura im hanging out with caleb and beau  matt you finish your ability your detect magic is now in effect  taliesin 19  matt glancing into one of the far end cages 
none	 what did you get yasha  ashley i got 17  matt you guys hit two other cages on the right side both the far end close edge of that  platform youre looking in the small cages you see another urn and you glance up and see at the  very top theres a chain of some kind that was wrapped in a noose you see the urn that contains  the ash down within there are remnants of ash around the outside in a circle and bits of cloth  and material and this chain noose hanging above 
none	 where this urn was  taliesin would i be insane for thinking this is how they make them  sam make what  laura the willowisps  liam the willowisps are the dead they are left from the dead  taliesin this was a factory maybe  travis heading over to molly i stop in the middle of the room at that inert circle does it  look like anything  matt make an arcana check  ashley are we near the table at all  travis 21  matt you guys can move to the opposite end if you 
none	 want to get closer to the table looking at the  inert circle it looks like you have an instinctual arcane knowledge thats been imparted  upon you by whatever this gift has been given to you so the knowledge comes to you its alien but  familiar at the same time and your brains trying to work through this disconnect this circle looks  like it was once developed to be a teleportation circle but has since it seems been scarred and closed  travis i feel like this was used to move or deliver people or things this 
none	 was a center for transportation  sam what the fuck are you talking about  laughter  laura are we in the other room still or did we come in  matt caleb has now finished and you guys can enter the chamber  travis real bright  laughter  sam sounds good fjord  ashley how close to the table can we get  matt how close do you want to get theres two tables both kittycorner into the further chamber  taliesin i want to wait for caleb at this point  laura can i look around the 
none	 room  sam do you need my help  travis is he done yet  liam give me a second to blacklight the room  marisha caleb i love you but we are missing out on other shit im having extreme fomo right now  come on  laura were in the room lets go  liam yeah im waiting for the narrator to  matt yeah i told you a couple times you finished your spell  liam yes good right so im walking is there anyone between the bookshelf and me where i am  is fjord  
none	 matt yes currently it looks like jester and yasha are in between that space  liam whos the closest  matt theyre both equidistant  liam i walk up between the two of them and i have a 30 foot radius on the spell so im  basically doing this but im very interested in the bookshelf obviously im looking everywhere  matt theres a very faint magical aura from the symbol in the center but it seems largely clouded  and marked off its like somebody had taped over a blacklit drawing its been marred and prevented  from 
none	 use from what it seems at the moment  liam is there a type i will ask that every time  matt yes there is and just to be consistent here  liam friendship magic  matt it is conjuration there is a very faint magical essence straight ahead as you focus and  lean forward it becomes a little stronger above the bookshelf there is a shape embedded in the  wall that is emitting a slight magical aura  liam in the wall above the bookshelf  matt above the bookshelf you dont have quite enough light and 
none	 yashas holding the torch thats  being cut off from the roof  taliesin ive got a light stone in my pocket if anyone wants to go for it here hold on  sam a light stone  laura ooh ill climb up on the bookshelf  taliesin careful  matt as you approach the bookshelf is mostly empty similar to the first chamber you went to  it looks like either everything in here was taken or destroyed most of the bookshelf is plain empty  with broken pieces and tattered bits of paper and no books present on 
none	 the shelf at the moment  liam zero books  matt that you see on the shelf as you close in to look at it as you climb the shelf and look up  above the bookshelf there is placed ornamentally on the wall a very wide blade longsword of some  kind is bolted onto the wall as an ornamental display  laura does it look trapped is this trapped on the wall  sam you want me to check it  laura climb up on the bookshelf with me  travis please pull it out  taliesin this 
tavern	 cant go wrong  sam i go up and check i got a oh wait disadvantage im drunk thats a 19  matt 19 best you can tell theres no trap  laura should i try to pull it out  travis yeah pull it off ill give you all my health potions in one day  laura i lift i pull and i try to pull it off the wall  matt okay it takes you a moment because its bolted in the blade comes free and you pull back  on it you begin to whoa off the 
none	 side you guys catch jester she plummets off of the bookshelf  you manage to trust fall her if you will as she falls from the top  laura good job not getting stabbed you guys because this is sharplooking  matt it is a heavylooking blade the hilt of it is gold and curls up to the side it is all these  tiny runes inscribed along the edge the central blade is thick its about that wide at the side  and slowly tapers to the edge none of you come from a specific blacksmith background so you 
none	  wouldnt know the purpose of the blade but it looks dangerous  laura this is a sacrificial blade for sure  travis is it long  matt yeah its about six feet long  liam jesters holding it  laura im holding it  liam hows the girth  laura its pretty girthy can you identify it  liam i obviously can do that and i have a little bit of reserve left but we are still not topside  yet so we can either sit for ten minutes and i can tell you exactly what it does or 
none	 we wait  until later but im not willing to do this  marisha no more ten minutes  liam it is ten minutes  laura ill strap it to my back  liam we can wait until later  taliesin put it in the bag  laura its very sharp and the bag is easily punctured and i dont want to risk it ill strap  it to my back  travis shouldnt we for good measure be breaking up these other ceramic  taliesin are those ceramic pots giving anything off  matt the tables by the way 
none	 that are right next to the bookshelf have writing utensils quills on  the side one has an inkwell that has been long dried over that has a spider web attached to it  liam does it have any paper  matt make an investigation check  liam a natural 20  laura ooh  matt you dont notice any paper but as you glance underneath one of the tables on the bottom  it looks like one book has been not taken or at least had fallen beneath and was left behind  sam liam just got an erection 
none	  matt i heard it it was like deep thud on the table  travis oh come on its like light thud  liam no the first one was right  matt the book as you pull it out a corner of it is burned pretty heavily  liam detect magics still going by the way  matt correct theres no magical source from it where you found it theres a bit of an ash trail  that leads back towards the far wall towards where one of the braziers is you get the sense  that maybe whatever was 
none	 in here may have been thrown in the braziers to burn and this book got  discarded or thrown you open and start looking through the pages what languages do you know  liam i know common oh god i dont know where to look on dd beyond  sam proficiencies  matt it would be under proficiencies probably  sam no its not there  matt oh its not okay  sam come on dd beyond  taliesin character details under description  liam description character details i know sylvan common and celestial  matt you do not recognize 
none	 this script  liam then i will cast comprehend languages  sam i hope that doesnt get rid of all your other spells  liam it doesnt just one i cast comprehend languages  matt as you finish casting the spell calebs hand incantation completes the eyes light up with  a strange yellowish energy all the words on the page that previously made no sense suddenly shift  go out of focus and come back into focus in a language that you can understand it is draconic  reading through briefly and it is scribblings disjointed and broken in 
none	 place taking a moment to  look through you get the sense this is the journal of somebody named siff duthar  liam dont write that down  laura why  liam because only i know it  marisha im definitely going to write it down  sam siff duthar  matt siff siff duthar  laura the thing is he probably wont ever tell us  sam hell tell me  matt the pages the ramblings speak of a coming war they talk about foolish pawns who follow  their gods to annihilation they speak of the armies of 
none	 ghor dranas washing over the land and  pauper and kings alike being saved not at all and being placed on a pike and held like a banner into  battle regardless of who they are they speak of the weakness of flesh and the need to endure  beyond the paltry life shell that were given it talks about experiments with refugees finding if  the soul is bound to the flesh in any form be it ice or ash it speaks of an obsession with  avoiding the eternal hunger of the crawling king he who tunnels beneath 
none	 the world and will find him  sam oh boy this seems like beyond our level stuff  taliesin is there an audiobook version of this  matt it speaks of a bounty hunter who had infiltrated this sanctum after siff and while it  cost siff his legs the hunter was burned into the brazier flames of erasure a trophy shall be  taken and displayed as a warning  marisha its the sword its the fucking sword  matt from there it grows more and more manic the scrawlings taking you a moment even with the  spell 
none	 to focus and make it out speaking on quaking within the earth around that shakes the  surrounding hills and darken the sky the betrayer gods come the power of man must remain the  arcane gifts must bypass their punishment show them that they are not above their creations the  final notes grow even more paranoid worried that the secrets that siff seeks will fall into the  hands of ghor dranas and that all must be destroyed all must come to ash and from the  ashes shall rise again thats the final page before the rest 
none	 of the book is charred beyond recognition  liam right i tell nobody this  sam just say that all again one more time matt  matt i can  laura say it all out loud  liam i do read it out loud  sam that is hard core  taliesin whats in the urn  marisha yeah from ashes shall rise again are we going to fight some guy whos going to chop off  our legs  laura what  marisha it talked about chopping off our legs  laura but then this sword belongs to the 
none	 guy who came to save siff the bounty hunter  travis yeah  marisha yeah the trophy was a warning he lost his legs  taliesin i want to take a look at some of these cages with the urns  laura what was the thing about fire or ice though it was like fire or ice  liam jester while molly is looking around hold that for me hold it still  laura hold what still  liam the sword and i will tell you what it is but you have to hold it for a while muscles  
none	 laura im good  matt as you guys are having this conversation you begin to notice as youre yelling and  talking your breath is now visible in the air the temperature growing colder and colder still  you looking past the chamber towards one of these urns you see a very faint light a flicker within  where the ashes are as this happens the center circle of the chamber begins to glow darker and  darker as a shadow begins to emerge from the center of the chamber shifting out of the ground  some sort of whipping 
dung	 cloak around a humanoid figure rises out made of pure shadow and darkness  the cloth is tattered and shifting around causing this horrible whipping sound like a wind is  blowing extremely intensely but only localized around this figure as the face is visible you  see this ghastly fleshstretched against the skull thats still made of dark gray matter that begins  to shift and move with the shadows around it the voice rasping now secrets are yours well pick up  there next week  yelling  sam wait what  liam oh man  travis something 
none	 wicked this way comes  sam im so confused  laura i dont have hardly any hit points  sam hes going to talk to us  marisha i tried to write as much as i could  liam its okay i have one spell slot left its fine  laura ive got a 2ndlevel and a 1stlevel  marisha maybe we should run  laura we should probably run  matt we have a week to think about it  laura was he coming up out of the teleportation circle  matt you guys were all towards the bookshelf 
none	 and the tables it emerges from the center area near  the circle not from the center of the circle but in that vicinity he wasnt emerging he wasnt  teleporting in he was rising out the ground while mollys off by one of the cages on the side  taliesin i saw something happen in that cage  matt you did  travis im at that other corner  matt yeah you and molly are both at the other corners  ashley i dont want to wait a week  sam may i ask what were we sent here 
none	 to get again  marisha i was going to say i dont think weve achieved anything  travis no we were supposed to get rid of the orb  matt you guys were sent here to  marisha he wanted us to bring back any type of ancient research that we could find  sam just research  marisha but we could keep any of the spoils  laura we could run away bring the book and run away  liam all we have to say is we cleared it  travis yeah if we want to be a little
