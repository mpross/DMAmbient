thank /none/ you guys unless you have anything else to kick forward i think we jump  back into the chaos of the city of brass and the elemental plane of fire on tonights episode of  critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back everyone sorry you waited too long taliesin so last we left off  vox machina was slowly making their way toward the final confrontation with thordak the cinder king  as well as the end of the chroma conclave hopefully or the end of modern taldorei as  we know it one way or /none/ the other you found yourselves preparing fort daxio for some sort of a  plot to draw thordak out in the process you took the rest of your intrepid adventurers to the fire  elemental plane in search of the final vestige that you had referred to yourself by the  androsphinx earlier in your adventure upon arriving here you spoke with a number of efreet  that ran the outskirts of the city of brass entered found yourselves immediately traced and  followed and discovering that the society here is well very different than ones that youre  used /none/ to you managed to barely escape a confrontation in an alleyway with two efreet you  escaped on the path of two seemingly recentmade allies for the time being led into their  establishment in which jewelry is crafted and with a plot to hopefully find whoever this fire  giant is that holds onto the plate of the dawnmartyr many of you allowed chains to be  affixed to your neck and wrists so you could pass as slaves in a society where theyre relatively  normal under the efreet that run the city your new friends senokir and /town/ uten are to help guide  you in the direction of the next part of your venture so picking up where we left off you  guys have been led out into this main street watching the giant lava fountain that pours out  into this deeply carved pit in the center of the ground you see flickers of flame that  occasionally burst out between the various bits of stonework that make up the floor in the center of  the streets here looking up into the sky you can see the deep reddishorange hue of the skyline and /town/  one burning hot sun in the sky that doesnt seem to move from its position but grows slightly  dimmer as the day goes on you are all led out into the street with senokir and uten leading you  out into the main area senokir turns back to the rest of you this slight halfsmile on his face  so we are to find our way to the first giant you requested this was the one named whaska is that correct  laura whispering whaska louder mmhmm  matt let us find our way to the zenith forge /none/ where he does most of his work  travis forge  matt zenith forge now come follow me and he tugs the chains with a sudden burst and pulls you  along as you begin walking he begins to talk about how whaska is one of the few giants that  still maintains the privilege of freedom there was a coup within their people a few years ago  seemingly orchestrated by some of their own as such most of the fire giants in the city  either were cast out or were placed in chains and the few that /none/ remain one of which youll speak  with on this day is one of the ones that sold them out so i hope you have your questions ready  travis yeah for you shitloads  matt shh  travis sorry  matt dont talk to your master in public  travis that was hot  laughter  liam i feel like youre working some shit out here  laughter  travis do we have a safety word  matt you did not establish one  laughter  laura oh no  travis weakly oklahoma  laughter  all singing oklahoma /none/  matt youre led through a multitude of streets led along the outside of this large place that he  points out to you that he refers to as the furnace that is where the charcoal palace exists  and the sultan of the entire city we wont be going there  laura the chuckle palace  sam the chocolate palace  matt the charcoal palace you are listening you are not supposed to speak  laura whispers im sorry  liam like charcoal  matt charcoal palace the air itself here as youre spending more time outside and the /town/  interior of these buildings arent meant to detract heat or cool either most if not all of  the denizens here are welltempered against the heat as you guys are being dragged along i need  all of you who do not have fire resistance to go ahead and make another constitution saving throw  taliesin damn it  travis im a master of a good burn does that give me fire resistance  matt nope so i think that you dont have to worry about it  marisha i had cast fire resistance on me  matt yes /none/ and how long does that last  marisha it lasts an hour has it been an hour  matt its been about an hour now so thats past  marisha ill recast  matt okay  taliesin im going to do a reroll  sam this is a saving throw or  matt a saving throw yes constitution saving throw  sam am i allowed to inspire myself on a saving throw  matt only on ability checks sorry  sam 11  matt 11 okay  taliesin 16  matt all right vex  laura oh 15  matt /none/ all right  ashley seven i burn to death  matt all of you manage for the most part to resist the heat your sweat is starting to become  more of a prevalent downpour across your face pike you take a point of exhaustion  all oh no  ashley im just feeling so tired  matt so you are currently at disadvantage on ability checks  marisha the heat makes you lethargic  travis im very familiar with that  laura well it does  matt travis can work you through the exhaustion levels  travis yeah  /town/ matt heading past the buildings and constructs you see these spires that come into these rounded  point towers all made from some colored glass some dark greens and blacks you begin to see  there are deep carved and wellmanufactured waterways or what would be considered waterways in  other cities except here the actual molten lava from the sea of fire pours through so there are  large bridges that lead over these constantly bubbling and churning long aqueducts that are  filled with molten rock  travis in the ground or raised or  matt in the /none/ ground similar to how you see most city aqueducts constructed except for the sea of  fire spills into it anything going over there is uncomfortable as the heat grows astronomically as  you pass over each bridge and the air itself becomes more sulfurous and you find yourselves  coughing autonomically as the fumes reach your lungs you begin to pass by  liam were walking out in public at this point right and theres people about we see other  beings about  matt you do you see as the sun whichand youve been here for two hours /none/ now so you have some time  its still very busy in the city and as you pass by you see many efreet on their own business  some coasting at different levels of height some just traversing through occasionally you come  across strange horned devillike entities that work walk in clusters  liam so question because i put on the ring of invisibility before we left  matt yes  liam but senokir i think might have chuckled when i gave my sister a wet willie so as were  walking and ive got the ring on as /town/ we pass people im doing this and looking to see if anyone  is reacting to that  matt no one else reacts except for senokir who looks back towards you with this  laughter  taliesin oh god that face  laura oh no hes so weird  i can hear you moving around me  liam fart noise  laura blends in with the sulfur i dont care  matt being led through the street you eventually see two large lithe grayfleshed creatures that  stalk by with these large hooked tails that bend over in front you /none/ can see barbs sticking out of  parts of their body and they move in clusters of three or four  laura wait were they walking on two feet or  matt two feet theyre bipedal and theyre stalking through  sam three feet  travis with like bigass scorpion tails  matt it resembles that the more you push into the city the more diverse the populace becomes  and you do see the occasional human the occasional elf not being subjugated though they  do usually carry some sort of a bodyguard or a handful of servants at /none/ their side as well but you  do see devils walking amongst the people here and many many efreet that are all walking the streets  with large scimitars at their side and with a uniform a long silk vest of a dull grey charcoal  pattern and it looks to be a pendant that hangs around their neck that constantly churns with a  flame and its a uniform for each of these and you get the sense as they walk around singularly  or in pairs that these probably act as the patrol as the guard of the /none/ city  travis those that are walkin around that dont like have a bodyguard and dont seem to be  enslaved are they still wearing that white and gold cloaky thing that our strange bit is  wearing  matt no they are very diverse in their attire  travis really  matt you get the sense that at least the outfits theyre wearing is their signature outfit but you  also have a hard time grasping what the cultural intricacies are of the city of brass being that  youre grog  travis hey man  matt as youre /town/ passing by these various aspects do you have a question  laura oh i just wanted to whisper vax  liam coughs  laura can you pick these locks as were walking  liam softly yeah  laura do it then subtly  liam i will stealthily pick my sisters locks  matt okay as you guys are walking past and at this point senokir is talking and he mentions off  to the side we are now passing the street of artisans and the city market this is what we call  the pyraklum this is where were going /none/ to find whaska this is where were going to find the  zenith forge and hopefully the end of your journey but we can work out the specifics later  as this is happening i need you to make a sleight of hand roll  liam get behind grog  sam whispers sleight of hand roll boy  liam well im going to luck that sucker  laura oh god  liam it doesnt matter it doesnt matter its a 20  matt okay go ahead and make a lockpicking check  liam okay okay thats fine as well thats /none/ 25  matt okay it takes you the better part of about four or five blocks to very carefully walking  with your sister keeping in pace with her gait making sure not to rustle the chains or anything  to distract senokir or uten as they walk along and uten is being very you know very careful  with his watch not just on you but on the city overall its not like theyre you know honed in  on you per se but very observant of the atmosphere and you get the sense that uten  definitely as /none/ far as the partnership goes seems to be the more paranoid of the two of them  however as time goes on you eventually click hear the gentle release of the lock on one of her  arm manacles and then slowly the other  liam as i trail backwards behind her you hear twins motherfucker  laughter  matt as you begin to approach a large black and gray building built from heavy heavy stones  marisha can i talk to uten a little bit while were walking  travis is she picking your nose  liam i thought /town/ the same thing its a scratch no pick  marisha so do you play tour guide often to newcomers in this town  matt uten says it is not often that we take newcomers under our wing like this usually they  are either customers or well to be arrested shortly so no this is probably the first tour  weve given senokir seems to strangely enjoy it  marisha playing tour guide  matt apparently motions over and senokir other hand out is like and around this way you  can see the fenstral spire which is a wonderful /none/ craft fair that happens once every two weeks  uten goes back to you  laura hes making shit up as hes walking  marisha seems he has quite a love for the city of brass how long have you all been residents here  matt weve been in business together for about the better part of ten years ive only been here  about 12 it was a very dangerous scavenge to begin but at least the laws of the normal world  do not apply here i have no idea how long senokirs been here he keeps a /none/ lot to himself  that one but i trust him  marisha and your business mainly deals in  matt fine jewelry i showed you our establishment  marisha well as you mentioned people ending in arrest are you bounty hunters  matt no i must admit our life is not as interesting as you might be expecting and i am  sorry for that i will say probably should not be talking so much right now  marisha sure go slaves walk forward like you do  travis why are you talking to us like that  marisha because /dung/ shut up slave and i smack grog with the flail  matt doesnt physically hurt but emotionally theres a scar  travis im wounded ive been gashed open  marisha forward march whip crack  taliesin to be fair he didnt say oklahoma  marisha you never said oklahoma  travis its dangerous to keep a race car at a red im just saying im a race car at a fucking red  pulp fiction  matt as you continue pushing forward eventually you come to that gray building with heavy gray and  dark stones its large square in /dung/ shape and you see an oversized chimney that bellows out constant  black smoke that pours upward into infinity there are a number of stacks like that throughout the  entirety of the city hundreds that all eventually bleed together as they all mingle and join in the  atmosphere whatever this atmosphere is consisting of the large doors are partially open theyre  about 20 feet tall and about 20 feet as wide as well they are made from a very dark wood but as  you get close its just a textured stone you see a dull light /none/ from the inside  sam where are we master  matt welcome to the zenith forge so once we enter i would have to be the one to ask all the  questions but that would be difficult for us to do so the choice is yours either we try and find  a careful way to funnel questions or we put our cards on the table and you do the talking  marisha well i can alter myself to look like you if you can hang back  matt you already look like uten and other compatriots you can /none/ still speak i just want to make  sure that well our slaves dont talk out of turn  marisha sure  travis have you spoken with a fire giant before  matt its been a while since the upset socially i found it best to not deal with them  outside of a customerpatron relationship  travis so weird are they good conversationalists  matt theyre curious  ashley you seem a little bit nervous i cant really tell because youre so strange in a  wonderful way  laughter  matt youre sweet little one  ashley thank /none/ you  matt theyre very big  ashley okay  matt and consider that since they kept their freedom theyre probably rather cunning  ashley bigger than him  matt youll see  ashley oh  matt as he begins to tug the chains and pull you through the doorway  sam shit what questions are we asking  laura i guess we have to ask like hey do you have any cool collections do you play cards have  you won a lot stuff like that  marisha yeah whats going to make him give us this thing anyway /none/ do we have anything to give him  laura well arent we going to try and steal it once we see it or are we really going to try and  purchase it  travis maybe hes got beef with somebody in the city and well go out and jack em up if hell  tell us where  laura or maybe if we see that he has it then we can challenge him to a game of cards  marisha or maybe oh  sam if we see that he has it how do we know that he has /none/ it  travis and marisha yeah he might not have it  liam you could also chat with him and i could walk over and take it  marisha well maybe he wont know its value  travis its a suit of armor though  laura that he cant fit into because hes huge and its for normal people  marisha you still have your locate item correct  laura i do oh yeah  sam use it now  laura okay i use it  taliesin now  matt youre going to stop as youre being pulled into the /none/ foyer of this building in chains and  youre going to begin to cast the spell  laura oh do i have to stop i cant do it as were walking  matt i mean you can do it its a visual thing  taliesin we can hold him  marisha senokir hold  taliesin one moment  marisha senokir  matt yes  taliesin were going to  marisha hang on a little bit of preparation on our end if you dont mind  matt all right then decide i mean if you wish to progress  laura as /none/ hes talking i start doing it  laughter  matt all right its really quick and you basically have to pull out your component from the  side there its a little twig and you snap it and you continue the ritual all right you  concentrate for a second as hes talking and currently no you do not sense it  laura okay and that lasts for ten minutes  marisha but it can point us in the right direction  matt it lasts for up to ten minutes yeah  travis was it 1000 feet  matt 1000 /none/ feet  travis radius  laura senokir how large is the forge  matt well here its a few rooms its large enough to house whaska and his servants to  construct the crafts that they are good at  travis what do they construct  matt as far as i know arms armor you see fire giants they find their sense of selfworth in  society by their craftsmanship so its a very important thing for some  travis right yeah so like wheels or like weapons arms you said arms  matt i said arms  travis i /none/ have a hard time listening when you talk like that  matt would you like me to speak slower  travis it might help you know  laura no thats all right  taliesin no thats just fine  matt so are you to funnel questions or do you wish to ask as a troupe  travis and taliesin and laura funnel them  matt then decide on your questions now or covertly speak once we enter but we cannot stay  here in the open and continue to talk long  sam three questions quick  travis yeah has /none/ he heard of the dawnmartyr  taliesin were looking for a suit of armor he may have won in a card game  laura yeah  marisha looking  travis and maybe he didnt win it but has he seen it heard of it  laura right has he seen a suit of armor  taliesin that vanished during a card game  travis question two does he know where it may be  taliesin it has great emotional value  travis and question three if he doesnt want to tell us where is there someone that he has an /none/  errand that he need run in exchange for  marisha do we mention the suutan bloodline or do you think that would be bad blood is that bad  travis singing hey maybe now weve got  all singing bad blood  laura i dont know does senokir think that that would be bad  marisha is it a bad idea to mention the suutan bloodline  matt i dont know  laughter  marisha im sorry you just seem to know so much about this fine city  matt i know enough but i dont know of the /none/ bloodline specifically ive heard of it you can  certainly inquire within thats why were here  travis yeah thats three has he heard of them does he know where it is and if he wont tell us  does he need an errand run and suutan bloodline  laura senokir where are you from originally  matt these questions arent pertinent at the moment  laura thats true i was just curious youre so interesting  matt thank you now shall we  marisha yeah  taliesin yes lets  matt gives a tug on the chain leads you /none/ guys inside  marisha sorry guys  matt the interior is very dimly lit thankfully most of you have some form of darkvision this is  an open heavy hall where in the distance you can see four different forges that are burning  simultaneously they are being fed by a small trail of the exterior sea of lava that is being  funneled into the back corner within you can see there is a large anvil in the center of the room  as well as a number of smaller anvils off to the side it appears to be /dung/ four humansized figures  you can make out the shadow of them in the darkness they appear to be human or humanlike  and theyre in the process of moving things behind they have troughs of water so they can  quench the heated weapons there at the center anvil you see a large hulking figure standing  dark black leather apron across the torso currently holding with heavy tongs this large  superheated piece of metal red sparks fly and illuminate the room with one hit the second  splash of light as you see this piece of metal /dung/ being slowly rotated from side to side its  beaten into a heavier shape the dark metal having a bladed edge to it the actual length of it  probably twice the size of grog  liam whats the guesstimate on this fellas height  matt id say in the neighborhood of 20 feet 16 to 20 feet from this vantage point  laura i guess hes the size of the zombie giants we fought  marisha in whitestone  matt hammering so go  marisha you want me to talk first yeah no okay  matt well youre the /none/ one who wants to ask questions  marisha yeah i got this  travis and laura dont fuck it up  marisha thanks guys  sam im hanging back behind percy here  marisha does this guy have a name senokir  laura whaska  marisha right sorry good day fair whaska strong whaska  matt the last hit strikes the blade before the hammer pulls back the currently hunched and  focused fire giant suddenly pulls back and is standing you see the glowing iron metal off the  side gently gliding across the ground and scraping the stone /dung/ before it comes to rest at the  side the giant stands at its full height you can see the heavily red bearded chin of itself gently  singed on the edges the dark gray ashlike skin of the face looks down at you the eyes glowing  with piercing red dots through the shadow yes  marisha hi i am keyleth of the ashari druids sorry i was curious if i could ask you a few  questions and just take a moment of your time which im sure is very valuable  matt the metal blade lifts and /none/ smacks the ground with a resounding ting sound that rings all the  other individuals working at the forges stop their work and look up  marisha we promise we can make it worth your time  matt the giant looks back does this with his hand you hear the wind resistance across his  massive arm and all the rest of the servants gather their materials and begin to finish what  theyre doing quickly and set them aside as they begin to go about finishing up their business  whaska takes the large unfinished metal blade and sets /none/ it onto the anvil puts the tongs down with  this heavy echoing clack in this large chamber the apron gets removed and tossed over the rest of  the materials and tools and walks up slow heavy footsteps and stands there looking straight down  at all of you towering over your group backlit from the glow of the red forge hue behind him  you may ask your questions  marisha we are in search of a piece of armor something that holds great weight and many legends  behind it  matt then i have probably made /none/ it chuckles  marisha maybe you have it is called the plate of the dawnmartyr are you familiar with this  matt his eyes squint a bit i am not familiar with this i did not make this armor you ask  marisha i dont believe it is from this realm but it resides here it was won by a fire giant  as yourself in a game of cards  matt a game of cards  marisha or some call them card games  sighs and laughter  matt i may know who you would actually be seeking  /none/ marisha really that would be phenomenal information  matt this information that would lead you to this powerful legendary soughtafter armor you  seek is it worth a lot to you  marisha well look you shouldnt compare it to you or the things youve made right im sure  matt he crosses his arms you hear the clatter of the metal bracers he has on cling against each  other as his muscles tense  marisha yes its very valuable for us to find it yes  matt then he begins to walk over to the side footsteps grabs /none/ something in the shadow and you  hear this scraping sound creak of heavy wood being dragged across stone as he lifts up and  slams in front of you a table a little bit larger height than you you can look just above it but  its a relatively large table boom then make your offer  marisha im assuming you dont want me to  travis coughs jewels  marisha right quietly do we still have all those jewels  laura ask senokir what he means  marisha i look at whaska and i say let me confer /none/ with my other masters hey senokir what does he  want what do you think is fair here  matt well usually as a craftsman they want something of their craft perhaps  marisha craft they want something okay  matt or you could always ask  marisha sure yeah ill ask whaska  matt yes  marisha in speaking with my fellow masters we want to make sure we give you something that is  fair and desired is there anything that you might have on your wish list  matt he reaches forwards and rummages through a small /none/ pouch thats affixed to the side of his  belt when i say a small pouch small by his comparison the pouch is about the size of you  keyleth and as his fingers dig around inside you hear the clanging of heavy metal and various other  objects slamming into each other as he pulls out some sort of strange small cylinder he lifts it  to his eye and peers through it  marisha oh hes looking to see what we got  matt scans through  laura oh no  matt for servants you all walk with /none/ many enchanted powerful and desirable affixions to  yourselves  marisha you are a very intelligent and observant man  matt puts away the cylinder into the pouch  marisha giant fire respected fire giant  matt offer me some of

over very intently takes the blade holds it in his hands this is a very good start  marisha oh yeah well /none/ lucky you i also happen to have this awesome magic choker 1  travis choker did you offer the fire giant a fucking choker  taliesin he can wear it as a pinkie ring  marisha i also offered him a tiny ring hes going to use it  taliesin its going to be like a little eyebrow piercing  matt as

will tell the illuminated of the dubious outsiders masquerading as servants /none/ slaves  sent to undermine the rule of the the grand sultan of the efreet the lord of the flame the  potentate incandescent the tempering and eternal flame of truth the most puissant of hunters  marshall of the order of the fiery heart the smoldering dictator the crimson firebrand marrake  alsidaan alhariq ben lazan  travis god bless you  matt so what is your final offer  marisha was that one mans resume  travis vax give him all of your vestiges  laughter  marisha what if we give him some of the dragon

as yourself deserves only the finest of materials  how about some whispers dragon scales dragonhide white dragon what kind of dragonhide  white dragonhide  matt one large hard raises up and begins to tug at the edge of his beard  marisha a lot of white dragonhide i think we even have a fair amount  travis leave it /none/  laura just let it go  matt make your offer  laura get it out of the bag of holding  matt his finger taps the edge of the table  sam put it on the table people  laura give him like 40 pounds of white dragonhide  marisha yeah he needs a lot hes gonna have a big loincloth a really big loincloth  taliesin thats going to be weird  travis 40 pounds of white dragonhide  laura right can we do it like that  matt yeah you go ahead and unveil and put 40 /none/ pounds of white dragonhide  marisha i want to make sure its like one two three four five five minutes later 37  laura but its better if its one big piece as opposed to a bunch of tiny little pieces  matt you manage to pull all of the hide out with flourish as you finish whaskas mouth turns into  this wide grin as his arms go out thump scoop it all to his end of the table your respect will  be remembered he takes the handfuls of it and the sword puts the rings into the /none/ pouch takes  the sword and jams it into his belt takes the hide and walks over to the side and opens this  large chest throws everything into the side of it closes it and begins to walk over as he  walks away from it you hear this heavy metal click when hes about 15 20 feet from the chest he  steps to the table now he then rests his elbows on the table folding his hands under his  chin leaning forward towards you and looks over the rest of the troupe there are two other /dung/ fire  giants here one is sugan sugan well was the brains behind our positions i have this foundry  and this forge because sugan led us against our people he currently enslaved most of our kin  with my help and with the help of juuraiel and her late husband guras sugan he currently  resides within the foundry itself as a respected chain lord to the rest of his kind do not speak  to sugan you seek juuraiel juuraiel runs a powerful slag mine in the pits her home is  outside the shrine to surtr called /none/ the smoking hammer shrine look for the spiraling tower of  black iron and copper if there is any problems and he reaches back and pulls forward a small  square metal icon and he flicks it over towards you it looks like a small piece of copper in his  thumb but as he flicks it in your direction you reach out instinctively to grab it keyleth and  then realize oh shit and you have to back out of the way as it loud thud roughly the size of  a manhole cover  marisha its a ring /none/  matt its a large piece of square metal you look at it and it has a series of runes that you  recognize as being giant imprinted into the metal this will grant you respect and conversation with  juuraiel should she show any resistance just tell her i gave it to you  marisha thank you i go over and i start trying to grunts pick it up  matt make a strength check  laughter  travis use your legs bend the knees  taliesin oh no  liam pull a hammie  marisha eight total  /none/ matt you can get it a few inches off the ground  marisha or just a check right just a straight check  matt yeah just with your modifier  marisha okay then five  matt you get it a few inches off the ground before it crashing sound hits the ground with a  resounding clang  marisha hisses in pain  matt almost got your finger but youre fine  marisha okay  travis do you want me to  marisha yeah  travis cmon beast mode  laura youre so strong pike  ashley ill give it /none/ a try  sam cmon pike lift that thing  laura get it  ashley oh definitely not just doesnt even move thats a seven  matt between the two of you given about five minutes you guys could eventually carry it  marisha you wouldnt happen to have a wallet version would you dont worry about it  taliesin can we put it in the bag of holding  matt grabs the table and moves it back to the space he got it thunderous claps our business  is done good luck and should you find yourself in any /none/ trouble you never heard my name turns  back to the anvil slowly puts on the apron and goes right back to work metal ringing holds the  metal over into the large furnace to the side to let it glow to a brighter orange to white at the  tip and begins hammering once more as you guys gather the rest of your strength to pull that  along with you  laura sexiest fire giant i ever did see  liam who was that  matt there is this awkward pause whaska stops and looks over  laughter /none/  travis shes touched just dont worry about her  marisha oh whaska is it okay if i ask one last question  matt depends on the question what do you ask  marisha how do fire giants feel about the name the suutan oh wait i already asked him  that never mind you know what been a huge help  laughter  travis youre not going to fistbump or anything  matt metal ringing goes right back to hammering  sam have you heard of the plate of the dawnmartyr  marisha is it too late to roll /none/ an insight check to make sure he was telling us the whole story  matt you could roll one now to gain his current composure while hes hammering the large sword  marisha thats pretty good 25  matt he seems focused on his work and cares less about your presence now than he did when you  entered  travis how heavy is that thing  marisha you know its more  cumbersome its awkward  sam doesnt have handles  marisha its very wide i cant really  sam like picking up a box  marisha yes but /none/ its not that heavy  travis you guys are doing a great job with that really  marisha thank you  taliesin its like a piece of prepackaged ikea furniture  matt yeah  marisha how is it they didnt design this to fit into a car  matt as keyleth and pike carry it along at an angle because of height difference  ashley got to take a second to switch hands  matt wait wait oh oh oh  marisha you walk backwards  taliesin we bought the new bed frame its called the nupe  travis no /none/ you go first you go first  ashley ill go backwards ill go backwards  travis turn it over  marisha are you okay going down the stairs okay okay  ashley okay  clanging sound effects  liam as we leave i give the saddest puppy stare to that wallet on the side of his belt and wish  upon a star and then i leave  matt all right you guys make your way out into the main thoroughfare senokir turns back very  well i know where this shrine is so follow me  laura imitates senokir /none/ great we will  ashley imitates senokir great  travis whispers weird  matt are you mocking me  laura what what are you talking about  matt right continue please pulls the chains a little bit  travis choking noise  matt an extended period of time to make it towards where the mines and the pits are for the  next hour or so walking through the streets as youre heading in this northward direction you  pass by a series of intersections where a lot of these lava rivers merge and splinter off you can  see /none/ there are individuals that are taking elements of it and carrying off large metallic buckets you  also notice in the distance one very terrifyinglooking structure all the rest have  this beautiful grandiose design to them there is one that looks like it is made of curved obsidian  spikes like a series of giant clawed hands climbing up over themselves it forms a bastion in  the center of the city this is on the outskirts of the furnace that you walked past or saw in the  distance when you first left senokirs establishment pressing beyond that /none/ you notice  that there is a heavy number of nastylooking devilish entities that seem to be running patrol  around the outside of that building you get the essence that theres a heavy devil presence in the  city of brass devils of multiple kinds you gather many youve never seen before but they  seem to be gathering around and have that same terrifying essence to them you see some that are  humanoid but covered in long chains with hooks at the end dragging on the ground behind them you  see some that are these nasty /none/ little impish looking creatures that leap from section to  section and usually travel in packs but they all have business they carry small satchels at their  side they mingle with the rest of the efreet and the other denizens of the city unmolested  unbothered unprovoked  liam i wave at a couple quietly  matt from a distance youre not getting  too close no one seems to pay mind  laura senokir what is that place  matt that is the embassy we shouldnt go by there  travis why whats in the embassy  matt /dung/ well thats where the ambassadors to the nine hells reside  travis right nine thats a lot  marisha is it like a cityscape  sam we have diplomatic immunity  travis senokir did that exchange go about the way you thought it would  matt sure  laughter  travis good  liam this guy likes to party  matt as you continue eventually you come upon the outside of this beautiful temple that is made  of hundreds of heavy dark iron and metal hammers that are all molded together in this mishmash  that forms this giant /none/ archway as you walk past it senokir pipes up again and that is the  smoking hammer shrine that was spoken of which means and he points over to the right there  you can see it resembles a home that is conical in its advancement its thick at the base and it  spirals upward made of black metallic substance rough around the edges like its been pushed  together similar to the shrine you saw but its this spiral that continues upward this very thick  spiral that quickly tapers off into a point you see there are /town/ levels to it and there appear to be  openings and windows this is an abode of some kind a very massive abode and to a certain  extent one of the more impressive buildings youve seen in this immediate vicinity  laura big enough for a giant to live in  matt easily as you get to the front of the building there are no windows that lead to the  bottom floor there is one very heavy door that is a halfcircle youre not sure how where or from  which direction it opens but it is this /none/ big round metal slab that stands there at the front  you do see a brass knob in the center of it that is roughly about eyeheight to you grog and  thats the extent of it as you approach senokir turns around so i believe weve found our way to  the home of juuraiel as you acquired the information about your turn  marisha yes we know sorry  matt so what is your intent here  sam well gang i dont feel like we should say the name of the thing that we want in case she /none/  doesnt know what it is  laura maybe describe it i feel like the more we make it seem like its valuable to us the more  theyre going to ask in return so maybe make it seem less valuable  liam she won it in a card game and hung it on the wall as a decoration  laura she could think its a fucking trinket it could be like nothing it could be like a  candlestick  travis do i know if giants have any natural enemies that they hate  matt other giants well they /none/ have depending on the type of giant many natural enemies usually  that exist within the topography theyre used to you only really know about stone giants in the  cliffkeep and maybe hill giants there is no specific sworn vengeful enemies to the stone  giants that youre aware of  travis did he say that sugan being the brains of the two enslaved other giants  matt you got the essence that there was a large coup there was a larger free  citizenship of fire giants that existed within the city through some circumstance these three  /none/ currently remaining giants sold the rest of their kind within the city into slavery or had them  ousted the three that did so elevated their social status and became more powerful  figures within the city of brass  travis i think you might have to play him in a game of cards  sam and marisha yeah  sam wait keyleth will  marisha no i will not  laura scanlan will  marisha thats a scanlan or a percy thing  sam me  travis singing youre a hustler baby  liam i dont want to do /none/ anything i want you to win this in a game of cards but ill be a plan b  theyre not going to see me  taliesin if you have the magic still we could find out precisely where the armor is  marisha thats true that spell lasts for ten minutes the locate item spell  laura so id have to cast it again i only have one more level two spell because i dont have very  many spells  marisha i can cast it because i shouldnt speak here  travis you did so good though  /none/ marisha thanks  travis oh fair fire giant fair hammering at an anvil 20 feet tall oh fair gentle fire giant  marisha oh giant my fair giant  travis do we do the spell when we get up there or now  laura do it now because its 1000 feet  marisha ill cast locate item  matt all right as you go and pull up your component you snap a twig  marisha no ones around and going to maim me right  matt you take a moment to wait until theres no immediate approaching individuals that might /none/ see  it as far as spells go it still requires a lot of physical action but you can keep it condensed  as soon as you finish you feel the immediate glowing beacon of your intent within that  structure  marisha its here  taliesin is it on the ground floor or does it feel like its above us  matt it appears to be maybe 25 feet up from where you currently are at an angle on the inside of  the building  marisha its going to be right on the inside hanging on the wall /none/  travis cant vax do some spiderman shit and check out the windows hes all invisible  sam its risky  travis why if he falls nobody will see it well just hear it  liam yeah and then you pretend like you tripped  marisha are there really high windows  matt there are no windows on the bottom floor on the second floor up there are yes which is  about 40 feet up  laura no its definitely on the first floor  marisha theyre 20 feet high so high up  laura thats what it is /none/ its on the first floor up high  liam so let me go  sam yeah dude this is what you do  laura he just said there were windows on the second floor  liam im already climbing would this be acrobatics  matt for climbing this would be athletics  liam athletics dang it bobby thats a 16  matt dang it bobby all right thanks to the rough construction of this building it isnt too  difficult to find handholds though there are certain moments where you have to leap and catch  to get there it /tavern/ takes you probably the better part of 15 minutes to eventually get up to that  area the first opening you see even though its a window is an oval porthole in the side of that  structure as you glance inside getting your arm up in there you are inside a servants quarters  but even the servants quarters are very large its simple you see two beds in there but the  beds are 30 feet long 20 feet wide with various hides and furs that have been patched together in  this quiltlike fashion but haphazard in /none/ their stitching other than that its not very pretty  liam i think there might be a lot of giants potentially in here at any one time  matt you see two very large metallic pissing pots that currently reside at the edge of each bed  laura eww you could take a swim in it  disgusted noises  matt were you so inclined you definitely could  liam but nobody in here now  matt nobody in here now no  liam are there any other windows along from where i am i know they would be a /none/ ways off  matt its a ways off to the next one but you could try to climb over if youd like to  liam yeah  matt i need you to make another athletics check for me  liam thats a 19  matt you slowly shimmy over while the rest of you guys are waiting as youre sitting there you  cant see whats happening you occasionally see a pebble thunk and a bit of dust fall senokirs  like well how about we walk around for a moment so we arent looking weirdly in public doing  /town/ nothing  sam youre right if you think were looking weird we should trust that  matt well said tugs the chain and you guys begin to be dragged in a heavy circle around the  nearby street  marisha i radio over the earpiece to vax and say hey were going to walk the block  liam yeah cool im just hanging  matt all right you leap over grasping lose your hand for a second and get back up there the  soreness is starting to kick in youre not used to this much physical activity of this /none/ type of  strength and its kicking your ass  liam so fast but so weak  matt so fast but so weak its already hot here and the beads of sweat are pouring down your face at  this point  liam i have little indoor fans like im a baseball mascot  matt yeah basically thankfully you have fire resistance so you dont have to worry about the  heat getting too much on you its more of the physical exertion thats getting you you do  eventually pull over to the next window as you get to /none/ it you pull up into the lip and as you  reach out to grab your hand hits something you look up and you see that this particular opening  has an imperfect thick glass window or at least a glass surface that is currently blocking the  entrance this is actually a window that is closed  liam is it transparent  matt somewhat transparent yes  liam so its just cloudy  matt its somewhat opaque because of the nature of its creation it wasnt perfect glass its  about that thick and the entire oval is about /none/ six feet high and about four feet wide  liam can i check for traps  matt sure go for it make an investigation check  liam okay oh good 27  matt all right this window is trapped as you glance around you can see that it is it is a  window that has a slot on the side the glass is wider than the window in a slot thats pulled up  through chains that you gather would probably lift it from the inside like a winch that would pull  it open or closed however on /none/ the bottom you can see along the edge on the very bottom edge you  can see some sort of slight bit of material that doesnt match both the glass or the blackened iron  structure of this building its a silver plate that rests where the glass sits down as soon as  it would move a weight would shift and something would happen  liam looking at it do i think i could disarm it from this side or is it something from the inside  of the room  matt it would need to be something from /none/ the inside even if you were to attempt to do it from  the inside you would have to be at the base of the structure from this side its too big for  you to do anything really  liam okay and i cant see shit  matt make a perception check  liam natural 20  matt which gives you a total of  liam oh perception a total of 32  matt all right as you peer in and close your eye on the inside you can see another bedroom similar  to the one over there /dung/ that you just passed by but this one is exorbitant in its decor you see  beautiful deep red tapestries along each wall that are the full length of it the bed itself is a  canopy bed that is 40 feet tall with heavy dark silks and fabrics that dangle from it this is a  gaudy bedroom for some sort of a giant  liam any armor on the walls  matt no armor visible from this perspective no you do see small pieces of art there are other  metallic trinkets that are built into the wall /town/ but nothing that resembles armor unfortunately  liam well my arms are starting to do this thing so im going to start going down  taliesin theres a giant velvet elvis  matt you eventually make your way down and wait for the rest of your group to return you guys had  a nice awkward walk being led quietly through the street and back around  travis can we be the monks from monty python  taliesin pie iesu domine dona eis requiem  matt as you guys begin chanting to yourselves senokir goes actually sure go ahead and /none/  keeps pulling you along as you guys chant in whatever phrases you decide upon you come back  around and you see the rest of them arriving at the door although they cannot see you senokir  does glance over in your direction ah it appears that our walk was just enough time  laura oh shit you can see him  matt i have my ways yes  ashley what kind of ways  matt your brother is a fun character  laura you mean a dick  matt from your standards yes being from where im standing /none/ i find it hilarious clipped laughter  travis oh god his laughs the worst  matt now shall we  ashley lets  sam we dont even know how this door works what if its like a delorean and flips up or something  laura do you know how to open this door  ashley do we just knock  matt well lets try i have not been here just knocks on it it barely makes a noise  travis sounds like bubbles popping  matt its like the knuckle against the stonework its making this dull awful sound nothing /none/  travis should i knock do you want me to knock or do you just want me to knock  sam taliesin and marisha knock  travis which one was that i dont know  laughter  sam the big one  travis okay can i lean back and slug the door using siege  matt yes you can go ahead and roll an attack no weapon bonus though just your strength  travis yeah so thats a 15  matt okay so thats your strength bonus and your proficiency modifier  travis not my proficiency modifier  matt so /none/ that would be 20 you reach back heavy impact and you watch as his hand hits the section  where the engraved metal door is dents inward and leaves this big heavy dent in the front and  the impact is like a dull thunderous clap of lightning you hear it echo on the inside  ashley its engraved with something  matt there was some very faint texture or pattern to it yeah a design that was built into it  travis knuckles by the way can i see that manhole cover you guys have been carrying around  /none/ this whole time  marisha yeah sure  travis its got giant runes on it runes of giant  marisha help me hey pike can you help prop it up on that side  travis do i recognize any of these runes  matt you recognize its giant you cannot read  travis yep this is very important script it says that you must carry this at all times and if  you let it go prematurely you will die  marisha what  ashley i dont think hes telling the truth  taliesin better safe than sorry though  /none/ matt grog make a deception check  ashley well hold it  travis natural 20  marisha what bullshit goddamn it  matt which is a grand total of  travis its a grand total of 21  matt keyleth pike i need you guys to both roll insight checks  taliesin this is the first time that actual travis has really leaked into grog  laura yeah no shit  marisha natural one  taliesin wow  travis the stars are aligning  ashley thats a 14  matt okay suddenly as grog says this you realize him being /none/ of giant kin and the  seriousness in his eyes and the stark intensity in the way he describes this if you drop this  something terrible is going to happen  marisha pike i need to readjust my grip here i want to put it on my back  ashley grog maybe you should hold it then because were not as strong as you  marisha yeah i dont want to drop it will it kill all of us is it a blast radius thing  travis the fable goes on to say that if you hand it to /none/ one of your friends you will shit  everywhere immediate bowel loss green apple splatters all over your feet just awful  ashley that doesnt sound true  travis the giant tales are to be respected  matt you probably dont believe the second half  but you do believe the first half  travis it is a fable  sam so it could be metaphor  ashley safe than sorry well just hold it  matt its at this point you hear this thunk and you hear this heavy low clicking as the sound of  chains being tightened /none/ and winding forward are followed by the large doorway rising up  laura oh it lifts  liam does it get stuck with the dent  matt you watch as it rises and there is a small carved slit where the knob itself rises up  and fits as the door entirely lifts into the structure leaving the front walkway open and there  standing you see with arms off to the side apparently finishing the rotation of this chain  sam a wench  matt no you see two male fire giants fully armored with large blocky black metal /dung/ swords  staring down at you from each side  marisha what are they wearing  matt they are both wearing dark plated scale mail and both of them have  these black bands of metal across their neck that have a small pulsing red gem in the center  sam but matthew are they fuckable though  those guards would you do them  matt scanlan thats up to you man  youve done some freaky shit in  your time although in this circumstance youd be the gerbil  sam im the gerbil  marisha lemmiwinks  matt /none/ you are lemmiwinks in this if you want to gain some experience thats up to you  taliesin and really interesting fanart  matt anyway they both stand there expectantly saying nothing  travis is this where we let the master do the talking  marisha were here to speak with juuraiel  matt theres a small pause you hear a voice echo from further back in the room though you see no  source for it what is your business with this juuraiel  marisa we have a deal wed like to make we have a token of our /none/ we want to play cards  matt make a persuasion check  marisha oh jesus  travis why are you talking persuasion check  marisha im the only one not in chains im the only one who can its bullshit  laura you could have made any of us look like not  marisha no i cant its only a self spell or else i wouldve oh thats not too bad  persuasion 18  matt theres a pause and you hear a few heavy footfalls getting louder as they go emerging  from around the side you see now /none/ a tall broadshouldered female fire giant with a very  strong square jaw her hair is pulled into this long red braid that dangles past her lower back  and you can see it drifting behind her with this large metal ring that its braided into at the  bottom shes not wearing any armor at the moment just wearing casual clothes and these clothes are  lined with gold and platinum this is a very expensive ware that she has on as well as rings  that encrust both of her hands as she steps forward and looks out /none/ towards you so you want to  play cards and make a deal you say  marisha i lift with pike the big manhole cover  matt she reaches over and grabs it from both of you  travis the fables were a lie  ashley were safe  matt she glances over it and puts it over in her hands so you have spoken with whaska  marisha yes  matt okay i will hear what you have to say lets hear your deal let them in she turns  around and walks across to the end of the /none/ room as the two giants step to the side removing their  crossed swords from the entryway that scrape across the stone and you may enter the premises  laura i want to look around immediately all the walls  matt make a perception check  liam 25  laura 29  matt as you guys walk in this central chamber the foyer if you will its beautiful the use of  autumn colors mixed with various golds and metallics to create this archway that is a band of  brass a band of gold a band of platinum a /none/ band of brass and repeats itself onward it has this  tunnellike feel and within each of these walls there are a number of weapons large giantsized  weapons that are bolted into the wall and have beautiful runes inscribed within and wooden  plaques on the bottom that contain language that only you recognize but cant read there are  shelves that contain large books that are locked up behind glass and chains roped across it this  is a collection this is like a small personal museum to your size it is huge to juuraiels  size its /none/ like a nice den  liam are there any pieces of armor with a sun on it  matt as you guys continue inward there is a large desk on the opposite side as well as a few  comfortable chairs off to the sides and a staircase that spirals upward to a second floor  there are very bright red burning torches that the flame itself would be a heavy bonfire by  comparison to any of you it burns and licks the edge of the interior without any damage done to  the beautiful construct of the foyer /dung/ this desk at the end which she has now walked around and sat  on the opposite side is made up of beautiful dark green wood and has gold leaf designs all throughout  the legs everything here speaks of projected affluence juuraiel this fire giant you have come  across makes a statement with her wealth with everything she presents the other two giants that  you saw at the entryway who had the binding on their necks close the door behind them place  their weapons up leaning against the wall and both lumber behind you as you /none/ walk in slowly  keeping watch as you progress inward  juuraiel raises her finger and says could you please bring a means of my guests to speak eye  to eye and the two giants diverge slightly both grab two of the chairs and scoot them in up to  the edge of the desk these chairs are about head height to both of you at the resting point so  youll have to climb up into them and then probably get to be up at the desk level  liam the cards are going to be like giant /none/ novelty cards  travis can i ask a question in my bag i have two vials of foxs cunning is that a potion  matt yeah  travis can i drink one  matt if youd like to  travis its so hot outside im so thirsty i would like just a sip i had it made because im  an idiot just in case the sewer plate says eat these and enjoy or something  laura yeah she already took it though im looking at the walls at around 20 to 25 feet do i  see it up /none/ high on the ceiling because ive been looking  matt as you guys get to the desk itself on the back wall behind the desk above her shoulder you  see a beautiful ruby shield that refracts the light in the room its roughly from head to toe  grogs size its pointed at the bottom and rises up almost like its designed to look like a flame  it has this uneven flickering frozen in time of the construct of the top of the shield on the  other side of her other shoulder you see much smaller in /none/ size but a beautiful set of make  sure i get the description right on this beautiful brass armor with priceless cut rubies  all across the rest of the silver inlay of the armor itself  laura youre going to be blinging out we got to get it  liam how many feet up the wall  matt it is about 25 to 30 feet up the wall its up where its resting about the top height of the  shield so theres an even point and its about five feet down from the ceiling  laura should we /none/ let just keyleth and senokir up on the chairs  sam i would like a seat at the table if thats all right  marisha let me get us out of this juuraiel do you mind if we speak candidly and dispose of our  guises that led us here  matt but of course youve already presented trust from one of my allies you are safe within here  laura can i roll an insight check on the whole allies thing  matt you may  laura i was having difficulty choosing 19  travis i told you the /none/ fables were true  sam oh yeah you know like loot crate and stuff  taliesin loot crate magical loot crate  sam doctor strange use criticalrole for 10 off your loot crate guys code criticalrole  matt you drank the potion grog  travis yeah  matt so you have advantage on intelligence checks  travis nice do i gain any temporary intelligence  matt theres a clarity in your mind that hasnt been there in a while not since being an eagle  travis do i look over at the symbols and do they all of a sudden /none/ start to mean something  matt no  laura oh no you cant read still  matt you need to learn to read still  taliesin you have a deeper understanding of the tragedy of that  travis i got to a b c well work on it  liam while you dont recognize them as letters theyre like little characters that  youre familiar with the burly guy and then the cross guy hes holding swords  travis yeah thats the tree yep that ones the wiener  sam keyleth may i speak  marisha i said wed dropped /none/ our guises so yes everyone you can take your slave robes off now  sam were all chained  travis not wearing robes  matt you see senokir looks over at uten  marisha senokir can we  matt not to worry uten if you dont mind uten pulls out the ring of keys that he has and  goes through and begins undoing your guys shackles this will take a little while  travis did the door to the room close  matt its closed the two servant giants closed it juuraiel leans forward with a grin so  /none/ please what do you come here requesting  sam hello hi there hi  matt even smaller and now leans in real close to the edge of the desk the massive size of her  face and the breath its delightful its a combination of rotting vegetation and very dry  earth but her teeth are gleaming the smile is interested in whatever youre about to say  sam hi there im a bit of a gambler im known around the worlds as being one of the luckiest men  with a deck of cards youve ever met ive won /none/ games in many of the different planes i see that  you collect many treasures that youve won in matches as well is that true  matt eyes shift back and forth over the rest of you here i have an interest in games of chance  on occasion yes so you come all this way to play games  sam yes i have i spend my life just playing games its my livelihood ive won many things  over the years in fact all of these great people large and small next to me i won in  various /none/ card games around the planes that one over there the big one i won him in a game of  gin rummy in the feywild this guy i picked up in a game of fish im here to collect possibly one  of your items if thats all right with you  matt make a deception check  sam 32  laughter  matt leans even farther forward to where its about two feet between you and her large eyes that  have come in and her chin is scraping against the wood to get a really good look at /none/ you she looks  over her red pupils slowly inspecting you the grin grows even wider as she leans back well  you intrigue me small one if your luck has been so great as to collect these fine specimens of  strangers and you bring them all with you to such a place where do you hail from if i might ask  sam places that information is not relevant right now  matt fair enough so you come to play me for what  sam maybe ill decide after our match  matt well i need to know /none/ what the ante is so i can ask for a suitable request for my side  sam certainly  taliesin im going to lean in and no vocals  sam theres a large ruby shield back there is that true  matt ah yes  sam he wants that but i think his taste sucks so im going to go for that brass piece of armor  back there  matt ah interesting so you wish to play for the armor  sam sure im a little man and it might help me in a fight someday if i ever /none/ lose  matt fair enough so she leans behind and pulls out a wooden box from a small cubby and you  now look behind the desk and there are a series of cubbies that are embedded in the wall and there  are different things that shes thrown in there she pulls out this wooden box unlocks it with her  heavy fingers and opens it she pulls out a deck of cards that is larger than what youre used to  playing with but small enough that you could functionally hold a hand small from her  perspective /none/ kind of  laughter  sam let me cut the cards  travis and you die  matt she takes it and closes the box begins to shuffle them without even looking away from you  as she looks at you she cocks a bit of a halfsmile to one side and says so for that do  you know the history of this for you to come so far to play a game there may be a reason you  come and the thing you select for the game we play has much value to you  sam honestly /none/ the game itself is whats of value to me i am just happy to win and keep my winning  streak alive what i get out of it is meaningless  matt okay  sam but if youd like to enlighten me on that object  matt we will play three hands the winner of two takes the pot  laura dry heaves  matt request the armor me i request your friends  laura i knew thats where she was going to go with this  sam well i was going to offer one of your choosing but youve /none/ only offered me one of your  items  matt take it or leave it if you truly have no idea what this armor is worth perhaps you wish to  choose another thing to ante  sam you seem attached to it i want it ill have it  matt how badly do you want it  sam certainly badly enough to risk these scoundrels  matt then we have an accord  sam we do  marisha hell yeah lets do this  travis ive never been an ante before  liam stonecold gnome  taliesin so many /none/ bad ideas start with  laura do we need to all sit on the table then  marisha does it work like vegas are all the odds on the house  travis is it wizards chess  sam may i ask what game were playing blackjack are we playing  travis strip poker  sam strip poker fivecard stud  laughter  matt we refer to it as the tinder start but you probably know of it as the gambit of ord  sam weve played this before  marisha wait did we end up playing it  matt this /none/ is the thing you didnt end up playing  marisha fucking fuck we didnt end up playing this but wait we remember the rules  matt you didnt play it you make an intelligence check being a bard that you are and  add a 2 to it  travis get the hand cone out  sam 21  matt you have played this game  laura thank god do you suck at it  sam i suck at everything  matt the hand is represented each of you roll a d8 but you keep the die hidden then you /none/ both  roll a d6 and then keep it secret then you both roll a d4 and then reveal them all together but  you can raise it as you wish  travis you raise after each roll  matt yeah  laura whats the goal what are you trying to get to  matt the highest number between the three rolls but you can fold if you want to this usually is  done in a betting type circumstance so well see how things go from here anyway finishes  shuffling tosses you a series of cards takes a /none/ couple cards for herself sets the deck aside  right in front of her the two guards in the back by the way we hear them stepping away and  retrieve their weapons and head back behind you guys just keeping them at their sides  liam so in this room lets say youre her and were all where we are and the giants are behind  the group is that about right  matt yes  liam and how much room is there behind her and the wall  matt maybe 15 feet 20 feet  liam im going /none/ to slowly tippietoe around the side of the wall carefully avoiding giants i want  to stand not directly behind her but off at an angle  matt make a stealth check  liam 30  matt okay you both take a look at your hands go ahead and roll a d8 okay  sam and now  matt so for this circumstance well go ahead and take a d6 roll it and put it next to the die  all right and now take a d4  sam and if we fold do we start over  matt if /none/ you fold you lose the round  sam oh well then its just a number  laura so its just numbers at this point  matt at this point yeah you walked into a game of her choice  laura theres no way to cheat  liam so theres three rolls in a row and shes done two can we see them from where i am  matt you currently went around the table  liam yeah im at an angle but im a lot lower than she is  matt make a perception check  liam luck thats fine /none/ 22  matt you get a good glance at the first two cards yes  liam can i mutters inaudibly in the earring as quiet as a mouse can i just breathe it  matt make a stealth check  liam with advantage  matt not with advantage because its an audio thing  liam is it three rolls i dont understand the game  laura theres no way we can cheat because the antes already on the table  liam yeah im going to wait  laura right theres no way to cheat  matt that you can think /none/ of  laura unless you can fudge the dice  marisha but thats risky  laura its technically cards  matt its cards the dice is just the mechanic for it take a look at your hand  sam i know my hand wait am i rolling the d4 or no  matt we rolled the d8 and the d6 she looks down and goes all right so to make this even more  interesting ill wait let us see how the first hand goes shall we and she puts her third card  in front of her face down /none/ roll now  sam quietly not good you guys  matt and call and she turns the cards over four six one a total of 11  sam one five two total of eight  matt that is an unfortunate way to open it my small friend but you seem keen on winning and i  respect that she takes the cards places them to the side deals out a new hand brings it back to  her shall we begin go ahead and roll your d8  sam oh man this is just straight rolls  travis were going /none/ to kill everybody in this motherfucking house  laura theres no way to fucking sleight of hand this shit is there  marisha can he add his bardic inspiration  matt no this isnt an ability check  ashley if i cast enhance ability on him  laura maybe can you pray for sarenrae  matt this is quite literally a game of chance if you wanted to try and fuck around with a creative  way to cheat youre welcome to try that could also go very poorly depending on how it goes before  you do the next /none/ one she stops and goes so as i was going to say before how about as your  friends are the ante on the table throw yourself in as well  sam and what will you give me if i win  matt perhaps the ruby shield  sam i love myself a lot a lot more  than a bunch of rubies  and a handle ill tell you that much if im giving myself to slavery forever i want  something a hell of a lot better than that im a man whos won 500 straight card games /none/ in a row  you think these slaves are something you should see what i have at home  matt make a deception check  sam 32  travis uhoh  laura oh no  matt she nods  sam ill give you myself as a slave if you do not draw your next card and skip straight to the  third and thats your number i get all three  matt very well  travis oh nice dude  laura oh hopefully she didnt roll an eight on that first one  matt she rolled the first die is /none/ placed there  laura and travis she rolled an eight  sam oh fucking balls fuck balls  laughter  laura we have to be ready to fight grab it and then jenga out  matt she rolled her last card but is not showing  ashley but take the shield too though take the shield  sam whispers pretty bad  taliesin no were good tell her to show her last card  laura maybe its a one  matt its a two a ten what did you roll  taliesin i cast minor illusion on the first card /none/ to turn the three into an eight  matt as you begin to mutter the incantation under your breath she says i would not recommend  bringing incantations into our game of chance  sam before i reveal my cards i have one more proposal  matt yes  sam whispers i dont know what it is  laughter  laura maybe we can perform for her  sam ill come clean with you we know exactly what that fucking piece of armor is  matt i had a feeling  laughter  sam we want it were not leaving /none/ here without it im sorry im not going to show  you my cards because before i do youll be dead sorry guys  matt she turns her head to the side you do not want to walk this path do you because if you  truly cherish the lives that you and your friends here have based on your current change in tone  this tells me that they now belong to me perhaps you would wish to continue to make this agreement  you came to make show me your card  sam i drew a three and /none/ a three and a three  travis oh that sucks  matt by one each time perhaps it was time for you to lose cards after all based on our  agreement you and your friends are now property of juuraiel however i see that you are traveled  you seem capable you are bold you walk in here after acquiring the will of whaska so you want  freedom yes  sam yes  matt then perhaps there is a favor you can do for me in exchange for this favor i  will nullify our contract and you /dung/ will be free to go does this sound viable  sam possibly is it a card game  matt the other choice is you are now mine or as you threatened boldly before that i was to  die but i can say given the current place that you reside the enchantments i have on this room  the friends of mine that i have at your back you will not have the outcome you wish  sam what is your offer  matt do you agree  laura did you ever meet a dragon named thordak  matt no /none/  laura fuck big red guy took a lot of fire giants with him  matt there are a number of red dragons that walk  laura this one was special he had an enormous jewel in his chest  matt sounds worthwhile but do you agree to our arrangement  sam just curious can we draw the third hand i just want to feel what it feels like to win once  ashley what about best out of five youre probably so bored with life why not  sam my slave speaks the truth  matt you are full /none/ of spunk and life and you are foolish do you agree to our accord  sam im really curious about this last hand if you beat me in this last hand i agree  matt if i beat you in this hand you agree otherwise what i still own you  sam yes well thats the deal  travis yeah i like that maybe youll win one  ashley one more hand  matt we will see who wins this hand for your own sake  sam thank you that would make me feel so much better about myself  /none/ matt it does not change our deal first die second and third she reveals four four four  literally rolled all fours  travis god matt you  taliesin and marisha wow  sam im really just bad at everything  travis did you roll an 11  sam i rolled an 11  matt oh my god  travis you are a deity  matt i wish i had this luck in vegas like literal gambling  travis its just four hours  sam best seven out of 13  laughter  matt you have agreed to our accord /none/ as per the agreement  sam i have agreed im already your slave so i couldnt really say no so yes i  agree to our accord what favor can i grant you  matt you will have your freedom and the armor you seek my lover does not live because of an  altercation with one who frequents the city my partner drogat died needlessly in the streets of  an innocent altercation with ghurrix a pit fiend that lives at the embassy  laura groaning ah jeez  sam sorry were not supposed to go to the embassy /dung/ we were told so by our tour guide  matt oh you should never go to the embassy but this ghurrix is tied up with a lot of politics in  this city as much as i would love to squeeze what infernal life he has i fear it would cause the  execution of me and mine so i sit and fester with the need of vengeance i need you if youre  as capable as you promise to go and find ghurrix in whatever way you see fit and carve  the life from his body now ghurrix /none/ frequents the arches which is the slave market of the city  where he finds rare and unique servants for the nine hells and his masters there goes about once  a week and is probably due there in a day or two go slay ghurrix and return to me with no mention  and no trace that can be brought back to my home then the armor is yours as is your freedom  there is no agreement youve already agreed so go  sam yes we accept thank you my master we will go do so right away /none/ two days you say  matt two days yes  laura does that mean we dont have to answer to you anymore youre equal to us  sam yes  marisha high five yeah  sam i release you from your slavery  marisha and into another one  sam what does he look like  matt she reaches down to the side of the desk and pulls out a very small book relative size  and flips through and opens a page to turn towards you this is what i seek to see  destroyed you can tell ghurrix /none/ wears a symbol of his station it is a thick black chain and at  the bottom it has the symbol of two manacles intertwined within a red symbol that pulses with  anger that is your mark  sam are you sure you dont want just a game of pinochle instead  matt you try my patience small one  sam please call me kenny rogers  matt two days go  sam lets go slaves im sorry equals peers lets go  matt as you guys step down the two giant guards step back and begin to walk /none/ towards the door to  let you out  laura actually madam master do you have any symbols that you can give us like something we  could show people so they dont try to claim us for themselves because were a lot smaller than  everyone else here something that shows that were your slaves  matt hmm she gets up from behind the desk and walks up the stairs for a moment  laura is she out of the room  matt shes out of the room currently  laura and two other giants are behind us  /none/ matt yes  laura what are they doing  matt theyre standing watching all of you  laura all of us except for  liam im standing there but im not  laura jump up and fucking see how its attached to the wall  travis how big is the suit of armor the dawnmartyr  matt it would fit a human a minute passes you hear the footfalls return as she comes down the  stairs with her hand in a fist she throws her hand open hitting the ground and scattering  across the stonework some of them /dung/ stopping at your feet or beyond a series of black metal  rings that match the ones that the two giants wear around their neck  travis but smaller  matt but smaller various sizes theres probably like a dozen or so you can pick from some will  fit better than others these i had made but i had no need for servants of your size until today  so go these should be enough  laura thank you theyre lovely  travis yeah i put mine on i like it a lot  sam have a lovely afternoon /none/  matt you as well good luck please kill it return  travis do we want to stay the night here  marisha yeah i was going to ask that  sam gross but okay go ahead  travis a quick query were like visitors we dont really have a place to stay now that were  yours do you have like a broom cupboard  matt senokir pipes up and goes actually youre welcome to stay at our place we have facilities  that could function besides its a lot of chain we have to carry back now  /dung/ taliesin its true  laura well do you the favor senokir of carrying this chain back to your place  matt thats wonderful thank you  laura a favor for a favor giggles  matt indeed well talk soon about mine  travis hes going to wear us like winter coats going to make a suit out of our skin  marisha nice lampshade  laura ooh his eyebrows literally going up when you said that i think he wants to do it  matt so the door is lifted you guys are led back out onto the street closes /none/ behind you  the time that has passed now i need everyone once again to roll another constitution saving throw  travis but i drank that foxs cunning  marisha am i okay  taliesin were going to be fine anyway we have the mansion  travis 24  taliesin 11  sam 20  marisha do i still have fire resist  matt your fire resist would have gone away you could cast it again  marisha ill just roll this time its just straight constitution  laura saving throw  ashley with a saving throw  matt yeah /none/  ashley so roll another  matt well no you roll and then

laura oh no pike but youre already so little  ashley my whats halved  matt your speed is halved so you are trailing behind everybody  laura grog pick her up she looks like she needs some water  ashley grog im just so /none/ tired  travis you look so mopey  ashley i feel very mopey  travis did you want a piggyback ride  ashley yeah  travis all right i pick her up and i put her on my shoulder  matt you guys eventually make your way back being led by senokir back to his establishment  lets go ahead and take a little break for now go ahead and use the restroom  travis you looked like the creepy guy was saying we should take a break for just a second  matt that would be frightening wouldnt it /none/ all right guys well be back in just a few minutes  well see you in a second  break  matt welcome back everyone to critical role that was terrible  travis the timing well shes been gone  matt shes been gone a while its okay welcome back  ashley im sorry  matt ashley youre amazing  ashley im just not working right now  matt thats okay so you guys have returned to senokir and utens establishment to rest until you  feel is necessary to undertake this endeavor but it is your guys prerogative as /none/ to if you want to  wait over the next day day and a half to jump to it or is there anything you want to do to prepare  for this circumstance what do you want to do  taliesin lets sleep in the mansion so we can gain some of our  laura yeah lets sleep in the mansion till we can at least get rid of this heat  sam if its a day or two we could go back to daxio and check and come back but then wed have  to get back into the /none/ city thats probably a terrible idea  marisha can i bamf right here whats your name what is simma sina  travis sequin  marisha senokir took a tenminute break and thats it senokir is there a way we could if i  wanted to plane shift home is there a way that i could plane shift right back here and not get you  know our heads chopped off for it  matt i dont know is there  marisha let me check guys you know let me check the druidic texts and see what they say  matt /none/ specifically you can choose a target in general terms itll probably bring you right back  to where you arrived here so youd be back to the outside of the city  liam at the respawn point  marisha well i cant say senokirs jewelry shop in the city of brass  matt you can specify a target or destination in general terms so the city of brass or dispater on  the second level of the nine hells you appear in or near that destination  sam no guarantee that wed be back in so we should stay  /dung/ matt up to you crapshoot its possible  laura as long as we know that allura will send us a message if something goes wrong  liam did it get dark out at all or no  matt actually by this time as you guys have gotten back and ended this rest you guys have  really come to get really thirsty and as the exhaustion hits in you all continue to reach for  your waterskins and theyre dried up  taliesin we should go back into the mansion  sam i agree  matt the sun however has /none/ gone to a darker red color like a soft eclipse almost and as it does  the heat remains but the light gets dimmer and dimmer into a red twilight and as it does the  city shuts down everybody goes home locks up and nothing but the efreet that you saw wandering the  streets earlier with the little flaming brooches or amulets in the uniform outfit wander the streets  laura why doesnt anyone go outside at night  matt pardon me sneezes  marisha bless you  laura bless you senokir  matt sneezes  travis give /none/ me a third one  marisha bless you again  matt fuck you hate you so much live gaming you ask this to senokir  laura yeah  matt thats largely because the illuminated maintain a curfew and if you dont follow the  curfew youll wind up in chains  laura okay different chains than regular chains  matt at first yes  laura okay  travis waterskins from our servants  liam whos that guy what is that guy  offscreen thanks govner  laura what are we at  matt kill him  laughter  matt if /none/ you require water i can procure that for you if you like  laura hmm  matt if you want water i can procure that for you  taliesin can we get water from the  sam well we have water in his fucking jug  laura yeah weve got so much water  marisha i can also create water  laura yeah but hes got a jug full of it  marisha pike and i can create water me and pike both can  travis i can create water dont say it like its cool  taliesin theyre not /none/ speaking in metaphor we know you can create water  matt all right so what do you guys wish to do  liam i mean are we in a hurry do we want to try to make this happen tonight  taliesin lets mansion for the night and then i think in the morning we cant find him tonight  can we  liam im not talking about him im talking about doubling back to the house and trying to get  through the servants window  sam you really want to try to break into this fire giants house /none/  liam if were in a hurry i mean weve killed some pretty gnarly things i know theyre big so  are we  laura she could be gnarlier than the giants that weve fought  travis and there might be an unbelievable amount of fire giants in that building  sam or traps  marisha or allies nearby its in the middle of a city  liam yeah and im sure the other thing will be super easy  laura the pit fiend  liam its on the table i mean whatever you know im going to follow your /none/ lead  sam you want to do a smash and grab  laura run in grab the armor plane shift out can they chase us down if we do that  marisha classic be plane shift takes a minute  laura no its instant remember we checked it  matt its an action  marisha it takes an action as long as were all in a circle holding hands  travis oh shit  taliesin and what happens if you cant plane shift out of that house we probably want to get  out of the house and then plane /none/ shift  marisha in case its magically locked down  taliesin in case its magically locked down  laura yeah thats pretty smart  taliesin in which the phrase i have many enchantments upon my home led me to believe  theres probably  travis i mean i really dont see what the problem is right hellfiend goes oh time to go shopping  for slaves he walks up to the arches we set a trap vax goes stabbystabstab percy goes  gunshot pike goes highpitched hi and like donesky  taliesin youre writing the best childrens book ever  /none/ laura i mean im down i think thats a great plan grog  marisha he also said that the pit fiend could be there in one to two days  laura yes  sam could be there tomorrow  marisha also do we know how much time passes in the fire plane versus the real world  matt youre not entirely certain comparatively the time you feel like youve been here for i  mean a while by the cycle of the sunlike light source in the sky here on the plane it seems like  youve been here for /none/ about a day  laura oh shit  marisha do we remember any type of relative time jump when we were here last time in and out  matt no but you were only here for maybe a handful of hours last time you guys came here  travis were you worried about being away from fort daxio for too long  liam yeah thats what i was suggesting  marisha yeah i mean we could come back to thordak just destroyed everything  travis cant we scry on the fort  marisha i cant scry between dimensions  matt /none/ it has to be on the same plane  laura can you scry on the pit fiend  marisha yeah  sam we know what it looks like  laura and you know like a thing for him right we know his name  travis thank you watering boy  marisha yes i could  sam cabin boy thank you  travis thats what i meant thats what i wanted to say  marisha yeah can i use the scrying eye to try and scry on the pit fiend  matt you certainly can so you have secondhand knowledge of /none/ the pit fiend  marisha and trying to imagine his emblem that she described with the two manacles and the black  chain because that was pretty cool  matt so focusing on the emblem that you were described you close your eyes and concentrate  holding the orb of scrying within your grasp okay whats your spell dc  marisha 19  matt whats the spell dc of the scrying orb  marisha it doesnt say  matt it would be 15 unless you cast the spell right  marisha yeah i get to do it so it should /dung/ still be mine right  matt usually it would be set for the item but for the purposes of this it wont make a huge  difference whats your spell dc  marisha 19  matt 19 okay yeah so it wont make a difference you close your eyes and you see a  brief fuzzy vision of the city from your perspective and then your vision jumps suddenly  and comes to fire then comes to black then comes to a quick view of that weird citadel carved out  of black obsidian hands reaching over each other the /none/ one that you saw earlier the embassy then  you feel a wall and youre thrust through a series of walls not able to really take in any visuals the  process is so fast wall after wall then you come to a darkened room a wide chamber that contains a  long series of papers and scrolls that are laid out in a specific format you can see chained to  the walls individuals moaning and crying and you see sitting in this small circle in the center of  the floor a humanoid a humanoid in the sense /dung/ that it has arms or legs but you see the pit fiend  sitting there almost meditating eyes closed large teeth jagged and pointed coming out of its large  jaw dark red horns that curve behind its head these large wings that are folded around it from  the back as it sits its knees out crosslegged its arms resting upon the edges eyes closed it  appears to be sleeping or at least resting  marisha can i get a focus on what the slaves look like  matt unfortunately you cant the target of your scry is /none/ about the most you can focus on you can  give a blurry atmosphere around them you can barely pick up the aspect of their presence but  thats the most you can do with the scry spell  marisha okay well he appears to be in his bedroom definitely in the citadel as she said  laura does he have any like cuts on him anything that looks weak  marisha he had big gnarly teeth and slaves  ashley did he look scary  marisha he looked very unpleasant  travis but its just him right one dude /none/  sam we could take one dude  marisha well he also had a bunch of people chained to the wall and this was after my vision  being slammed through several walls it seemed to be very deep in the labyrinth that is the embassy  which seems like a labyrinth  laura so well have to wait until he comes out  taliesin can we trick him into the mansion  sam the mansion door i think is only ten feet tall  laura how tall is he  sam 20  matt best that you could tell /none/ probably close to 15 feet  laura he could duck in  marisha hes a little taller than grog  ashley what kind of slaves did it look like he had all types  marisha i tried to look i couldnt tell looked like a nice variety  laura if we said hey i heard theres really good slaves up in this mansion  sam and then what do we do in the mansion  taliesin we can quietly attack him from all sides have a fight that wont draw the attention  of the guards  sam something tells /none/ me that people fight in this city a lot  laura yeah but i dont think the slaves attack the owners very often  taliesin theres nothing we could damage in there that would remain damaged  marisha unless we tried to use ourselves as slave bait again put a few of us on the auction  liam you seemed to be able to talk yenk into doing whatever you wanted do you think you could  do that with this guy  sam i could certainly make an appearance of yenk  liam i meant convince him to come /none/ inside  sam you mean dominate him  laura he could be much more intelligent than yenk was though  liam could be  sam i can try  taliesin he wears jewelry  marisha he has a logo  travis he meditates  laura he meditates  travis yep  taliesin bikram yoga  laura is that the hot one  taliesin that is the hot one  travis should we go recon on the auction as slave shopping or whatever it is  laura in the morning not now  travis set up the door outside of the /none/ market or whatever  sam so hes going to the auction to slave shop  taliesin yes  travis unique slaves he likes unique slaves  sam seems crazy that a gigantic fucking pit boss whatever he is would be like oh sure ill  step into this creepy door weird stranger  laura the mansion door is rather creepy isnt it  sam yeah for sure everything about me is creepy guys  travis but its unique and what if inside the door we make it look even more unique  laura yeah cant you make the mansion look /none/ like anything you want  matt within reason  travis thats important to say  matt there are limitations its still a mansion  laura i mean if it looks like a sexy den or something  travis yeah and if he doesnt come in the door then we kill him  sam this seems like a plan c to me convincing a giant killing machine to step into a nice house  seems like its a desperate plan of people without anything at all  taliesin hes not a giant killing machine hes a businessman looking to purchase  /none/ travis what do we go and make a deal with the devil goofy chuckle  sam the deal is we just attack him and kill him whats the big deal we were sent on a killing  mission here  taliesin where are we going to kill him  sam wherever we see him lets talk to sonny here creepy sonny  liam what about this this is a terrible idea could one of us goad him into following us out of  his abode or some building somewhere and you plop the mansion door outside the actual door so /tavern/  he goes to try to leave the tavern or whatever the fuck he goes into our house  laura ultimately if we can get him in a building and then back out of the building great but if  we can get him in that building why cant we get him in the fucking mansion  matt as far as you understand for a person to walk into the mansion they have to know theyre  walking into the mansion  sam so we can definitely entice them you guys can pose as slaves and show him some amazing /none/ feats  and say theres more where that came from inside the mansion but if he says no then  whats our plan  matt senokir pipes up at this point hes been listening in to this whole conversation off to the  side he goes if you are indeed going to fight a creature of this esteem i will request to not be  present thus you will be masterless in this city i dont know how to protect you the way you look  travis dont we have the neck rings the collars to mock that were  /none/ matt perhaps that will be helpful just make sure you have a solid story or another way  of masking yourself otherwise  sam i can make us all look different what would make us passable in the city  matt well dressed more like us or the others who are free it all depends on what you can look like  travis less appealing less different  matt or at least amongst the elite of this city where you wont be bothered  sam i can make us all robes and stuff  ashely dont we want to look /none/ unique for him to want  laura one of us  marisha seeming allows you to tailor us right  sam sure sure  matt actually what does seeming allow  sam i can shrink or grow us by a foot change our general appearance and clothing  marisha how about we do a little bit of both we can have a few of us maybe two as slaves the  rest as masters walking around incognito once one of us gets sold off we track him back so were  not fighting a member of the embassy of the /none/ city of brass in the middle of the market  laura that would be bad  liam i like the mansion idea what if we pitched the mansion as a traveling magical boutique slave  shop artisan slave shop we lube this guy up in a loincloth and this guy after a hard days  tinkering and we sell them this guy can sell anything this guy could sell a hunk of shit to  the emperor of emon  marisha these people have seen a lot of shit not just one hunk of shit  laura what if you /none/ and i dressed in exact identical clothing and then were unique were  you know twin slaves  taliesin i was actually going to say quintuplets we could all look the same  marisha is that a fantasy that people have  taliesin it is now  liam thats the plan  sam im sorry whats going on were all looking like you  liam were septuplets sextuplets and youre the salesman  sam im selling a group of identical sextuplet slaves and the advantage is just that they look  cool check out my slaves they all look alike /none/  travis if you give us one order we all understand the order  taliesin somehow a stamp with an upsidedown airplane is worth a fortune this obviously is  more rare  sam i could make you all other ways unique  liam i mean were fairly attractive i feel like six of us would be worth the price of admission  laura although you can only grow us or shrink us by a foot so this would be a really little  taliesin well make her taller and you two shorter  marisha can i also throw out /none/ that maybe six might be pushing it a little maybe we should drop it  down to like quadruplets  taliesin no because six is what hes walking around with hes got more back in his shop  liam its got the word sex right in it sextuplets sex sells sextuplets sell  travis you can do it magic door sextuplets  sam i love this idea dont get me wrong but i feel like convincing him that you are ablebodied  slaves with magical abilities might be even more of icing on the cake than hey they look alike /none/  travis i like that you vamp baby you do whatever do what you do  sam all right and when it doesnt work sonny can we fight him right there in the arches will  people be like what the fucks going on arrest them all  matt he is a known entity in this city if you wish to fight him in the open i would recommend  having a way of perhaps having the illuminated on your side  sam thats the guards  matt that is the guard  liam artisanal halfelf slaves  laura wait /none/ if we can convince them that hes broken a law of some sort  travis and laura bribes  sam we could also try to convince them that hes broken a law or done something horrible  laura whats against the law here  matt well going against the sultan is the most grievous of things he is a paranoid one  laura hes the one in the big no  matt in the charcoal palace  sam i could make the image of our mark standing out there in the middle of the arches cursing the  sultans name /none/ and pissing all over the place  travis right but listen i dont know if we have enough to bribe all the efreet what if we went to  the charcoal palace spewed a tale and said that this pit fiend is plotting to overthrow the  charcoal palace and all we want is to remove the problem for him  matt i can really recommend you not go near that palace  laura yeah lets not do that  travis so we do it  laura no lets not  matt they have wards to pierce through lies you /none/ will find yourselves never heard from again if  you have falsehood in your midst  taliesin does the sultan mark his slaves  matt the sultan i imagine would though i am not aware of it myself  taliesin does he have a seal  matt i believe so  taliesin if we were to sell ourselves as slaves we could be marked as the property of the sultan  sam and then what  taliesin and then we could claim that he was trying to steal property of the sultan  sam are we still sextuplets in this /none/ scenario  taliesin you dont get to negotiate that aspect even if were just sneaking back into the house  and stealing the armor were doing it as identical sextuplets theres no fighting that  anymore  liam one addendum our sizes dont change right  sam i can make you a foot taller or smaller  liam we could be the matryoshka nesting dolls from biggest to smallest thats unique  sam that is unique  marisha i feel like were spending a lot of time on this and maybe not enough time on our battle plan  liam /none/ oh that would go to shit anyway  sam okay so far lets recap recap vote and move on  laura senokir if you saw a bunch of people who looked the same that went from small to big  wouldnt you want them as slaves  matt depending  laura they were totally hot too  matt probably  ashley and also if they had skills each of them had a separate skill  matt most likely there are many unique slaves that pass through the arches  laura oh really whats the most unique one youve ever seen /none/  matt theyve had a few celestials through before those generally fetch a pretty penny with  the individuals youre speaking about the winged ones they apparently are very soughtafter by the  nine hells  laura wings you have wings  marisha or we could seeming wings  laura yeah but they could probably see through that shit his are real  liam so far only cinnabons here has been able to see through my shit  laura i feel like theyd be able to tell but whatever  taliesin if each of the sextuplets im never going to /none/ get tired of saying that were unique in  their own way and yours was that you had a trace of celestial which is why you have wings  travis do we still want to try and get him in the mansion  taliesin yes  sam so wait im going to recap these plans here plan a making us all sextuplets and trying  to get him into the mansion  travis celestial sextuplets  sam plan b were all sextuplets  matt seeming does not add wings it has the same arrangement of body parts but if one /none/ of  them has wings you could change those wings into a different color  marisha can i use alter self because alter self gives because i can give myself gills and stuff  like that  sam so plan a again sextuplets slaves mansion plan b were still sextuplets but this  time were somehow framing him for dishonoring the sultan and then attacking him in the middle of  the square  taliesin which is why plan a is much better  sam plan c still sextuplets that doesnt change but now were just ambushing him in the /none/  center of the arches and weve paid off the guards to turn a blind eye  taliesin we dont have enough money to pay off the guards  sam we have tons of money  laura we dont have that much money  sam i mean we could bribe them with six identical slaves so whats it going to be plan  a the mansion thats certainly going to fail plan b the framing job or plan c the bribery  slash ambush  laura plan a into plan b if it doesnt work  sam all right great /none/  taliesin remember were just to show off youve got more  sam of course ive got more  laura what is the sultans name  matt the sultans name is the grand sultan of the efreet the lord of flame the potentate  incandescent the tempering and eternal flame of truth the most puissant of hunters marshal of  the order of the fiery heart the smoldering dictator the crimson firebrand marrake alsidan  alhariq ben lazen  marisha its like when you start the little halloween singy things  laura i almost got it memorized though  travis /none/ i thought percys was long shit  taliesin mines better  liam scanman can you rearrange the inside of the mansion to look like whatever you want  sam yeah what would it be a slave auction house  liam could it be a theater for presentation or a ring to show off amazing skills wings arrows  sam a circus sideshow thing  taliesin somewhere between the folies bergere and caligulas living room  sam caligulas living room i can do  marisha maybe have a little side area with hookah and some nice dancers you know as he /none/ watches to  add to the atmosphere  sam i mean sure i can do some of these things within reason right  matt maybe  sam once the mansion is built does it stay built it rebuilds every time  taliesin i think its like a windows pc you can change the desktop settings  marisha what if the ladies went on a redecorating tear really fast  laura they hung a bunch of fabric up and lit some candles  marisha dim the lights  matt its still a mansion you have an indoor foyer you can customize /none/ any other floor plan you  like and the decor of it but it still looks like a mansion  laura so we can put pieces of fabric up  ashley opium den style  liam can we build a stage out of chickens  taliesin you could have little slave chickens  sam i mean that sounds so great im on board lets try this stupid crazy plan so were going  to go to the arches tomorrow disguised as the slaves of whatsherbutt  laura juuraiel  taliesin youve already made a sale and you have more back /none/ at the  sam sure so youre slaves im a slavemaster what do i look like  laura whatever you want to look like  sam no ive got to look like a slavemaster senny what would i look like  matt i would recommend not being a pinkskinned gnome like yourself perhaps something that could  live in this city  laura like maybe an imp  matt an imp would be interesting  sam an imp with jewelry and such  matt however an imp would not be solo and would probably still be behooven to the nine /none/ hells and  would work and be considered a subordinate to a pit fiend i would not recommend an imp  sam give me a thing  laura something little  matt perhaps an azer  laura what is that  matt well as you would consider close to them a dwarf you may have seen a few youve  seen a couple of strange individuals throughout the city as youve walked by theyre dwarflike  theyre thick theyre muscular they look like a dwarf except for instead of hair and a beard  its fire a wreath of fire /dung/ across dark grey almost obsidian skin  taliesin baby ghost rider  laura awesome be one of those  matt to give you a specific visual to give you a feel for what im talking about here when i say  taliesin thats baby ghost rider  laura that is awesome  sam im in  liam highpitched flames  liam taliesin and matt highpitched flames on the side of my face heaving heaving breaths  sam ill make a mansion for the night well all take a rest and then go tomorrow  matt i was going to make /tavern/ some beds we have  laura oh thats so kind of you but we have beds that are specific to us and we  taliesin just the break from the heat is the only thing that would force us to deny your  hospitality  matt very well  taliesin but we will keep the door to our rooms of course in your abode  matt of course well discuss soon our arrangement good night  taliesin why does he keep doing that  ashley should one of us sleep in his house  laura no nobody should  taliesin /none/ theres something wrong in it theres something in the basement  travis i have a quick request before i go to sleep can i try and find pike and see if she will  teach me the alphabet before my foxs cunning wears off  taliesin thats the saddest thing ive ever heard  matt you go and find pike in her room she comes to the door already groggy no pun intended  sorry about that you open your door and you see grog standing there looking a little sheepish  ashley grog whats wrong  travis yeah look /none/ i had trouble sleeping and i actually know giant but i cant read it do you  think maybe before this fancy smartpotion wears off you could teach me some letters  ashley well if we have a book or something i could a beginning to read giant is there  anything like that where i could know what the letters are  travis well no i dont see a lot of giant just even common or  ashley just common letters yes i can show you the alphabet ill write it out okay do you know  how to /none/ spell your name okay its very easy you have four letters in your name but there are two  of the same letter so you really only have three letters in your name  travis how many im not so hot on the numbers either  ashley okay well we wont talk about numbers okay whats the first letter of the alphabet  this you know  travis g  ashley thats the first letter of your name  travis oh it is  ashley yes but thats not the first letter of the alphabet youve said it before ah /none/  travis ah i hey  ashley oh its the first letter well you wouldnt  know that because you dont know how to spell  travis fucking a this is tough  ashley oh you said it  travis fucking a  ashley a a is the first letter of the alphabet  travis a ay a a  ashley and we can keep going  laughter  matt okay for the purposes of the narrative you spend the next few hours with pike in your room  beginning to learn elements of the alphabet of common you go /none/ through enough of it where you pick  up some of it and as the potion fades so does the memory of the last three hours  yelling  marisha thats so mean  matt this is flowers for grogernon but it wouldnt have mattered because the common alphabet  and giant runics are totally different things  travis yeah totally i just wanted to know something  ashley did i at least teach him how to spell his name  matt make an intelligence check grog  travis do i still no it wore off right i dont have /none/ advantage  laura you can do it grog roll a natural 20  matt ill say as you feel the potion fading from you  travis i burp and i get a little bubble  matt sure go ahead and roll an intelligence check  travis oh thats even worse aw minus two fuck twelve  matt you get gr and thats where it ends  travis my cursive is sweet im so tired you know ive learned all of these but im really  sleepy  ashley well keep working on it  travis im not sure we will /none/ but yeah keep working good night thank you pike  ashley you sleep so well okay  liam smash cut to a year later where hes going see kevdak run  ashley no thats so cute  before i go to sleep i am going to cast lesser restoration on myself to maybe get rid of  one point of exhaustion  matt okay  taliesin out of curiosity sleeping outside of the effects of the heat should make  matt thatd the greater restoration technically to try and  liam theres ac in here isnt there  taliesin theres /none/ ac  laura in the mansion not in the studio  laughter  matt greater restoration reduces exhaustion but you can do that as well  ashley ill cast greater restoration before bed  matt okay so you reduce a level of exhaustion  taliesin i am going to send a little time working on a couple things for the fort when we get back  netting ammo for the trebuchet just a sketch to start to design a very simple bolo for the  trebuchet  matt okay just designing  taliesin just penciling and then penciling ive got /none/ a notion for a watch tower thats super super  simple platform for two people tops with a rope that connects to a bell so when you start heading  down it it goes high voice fuck  matt great all right so as you guys all come to consciousness the next day you gather your  things and you step out of the mansion into the center of senokirs shop  marisha do we recover our point of exhaustion when we sleep  matt with the long rest you recover a point of exhaustion so youll all back to /none/ baseline  including you pike because your greater restoration your spells are recovered hp is  recovered if there was any loss of it so the day is yours what do you wish to do  sam go to the arches the golden arches wait first weve got to cast seeming  marisha are we going to scout i guess we still need seeming  ashley so were all going to look like vax  laura and vex  ashley and vex all the girls are going to look like vex  liam three vexs i mean its kind of /none/ the same  laura i mean yeah but ones got boobs  liam which one  laura which one  laughter  sam were going right all right so yes ill cast seeming on everyone making them various  level heights of vex and vax i guess  laughter  laura shouting this is awesome  sam and theyre slaves right theyre slaves tattered clothing  laura no no make us look like good slaves  taliesin simple white robes  sam all right simple tattered white robes  laughter  laura no i want to look pretty  ashley /none/ youre so rich you want us clean  laura make us clean like pretty slaves  sam youre clean thats right youre the best of the best you would have the best robes right  ashley like princess leia jabba the hut  sam totally right the best finest simple white  travis and we still have the neck thing  sam absolutely and wait am i making him celestialish  laura oh yeah make his wings when they come out like white wings  sam is that a celestial what does a celestial look like do they glow all /none/ the time  taliesin they have white wings correct  matt most angelic entities have white or gold wings  marisha did we find out if i could alter self wings  matt you could not it has to be the same physical structure  travis wait a minute we dont want him walking through the streets to the arches as a  celestial we want to get him in the house  taliesin when he pops his wings the wings will be gold  travis yeah we havent started walking though  liam can they be gold delayed later /none/ when they pop out  matt well find out  liam oh shit well  ashley can you hide them under a cape  sam i dont know where you hide them normally  laura they only last for an hour  liam in my shoulder blades  sam theyre in you ew  liam yeah well it feels that way  sam are you wolverine  taliesin we are learning way too much about everyone  travis so seeming on everybody but vax right  sam no  laura no why  liam the seeming on us we look /none/ like us already  laura its just clothes though  travis have we headed to the arches yet  sam were walking there right now  travis were going to walk with a celestial in the middle of the streets  laura no were saying were not making his wings look like that yet dude  matt you guys are not sure where the arches are  laura oh senokir  matt yes  marisha should we maybe go scout the location first as regular slaves  laura sam and taliesin  no  matt what do you require  /none/ laura hi where are the arches  matt do you require guidance there uten why dont you bring them to the arches i will not be  joining you  taliesin thats very fair  matt i wish not to get involved with a pit fiend i will ask though just to be safe if i  could have of your choice one small bauble to remember you by as we still have an arrangement  to discuss and knowing to an extent your capabilities theres a chance that you might  escape without returning to me  liam is /none/ that for memories or for some voodoo shit  laura its voodoo shit  matt it is to make sure that should you abscond without upholding your end of the deal i can find you  liam from each of us or  travis i can give him one of the sandkheg bottles  marisha no its okay i druidcraft a band around his arm  matt thank you thatll die soon  marisha you can like preserve it  travis no its going to die keyleth dont  matt itll still function it just will be lifeless so continue /none/ please stay safe  taliesin okay  sam yeah great  travis we go  matt uten is like okay follow me i will lead you even he is looking a little weird over at  senokir  sam and when i cast seeming i also cast it on myself making myself look like an azer  matt an azer the flaming beard dwarf  sam yeah i dont know if i can make flames with seeming  matt well say for the purposes of the illusion you can pull off something that resembles flames  enough to the point /town/ where it should pass  sam all right great  matt all right so as you guys walk out into the city you are lead by uten on a similar path that  led you by the pyriculum where you met whaska but you continue past that in the northeast  direction heading towards as he tells you as you pass near the naval grounds of the sea of fire  beyond that you guys find the streets become wider and the network of clusters of metal cages begin to  adorn portions of the center street islands within these /town/ cages you see humanoids of all  walks of life creatures beasts its a collection a veritable zoo of entities from all  the planes all bound to various cages chains and other elements whereas efreeti individually  bark from top in a language you dont understand you see large banners and streamers set across  elements of the road to mark various segments of this area and at this point uten turns to you and  goes well you have officially reached the arches i will bid you adieu as i also will not  want to deal with /none/ a pit fiend good luck  laura wait uten  matt sighs yes  laura so what happens are these all for sale then and  matt all the ones that do not look like theyre yelling for you to buy something most likely  laura okay and then other people come through so if you like do the door thing here then this  could potentially be a market  marisha is it okay to just set up shop  matt if you are convincing enough  laura convincing enough  liam do we need a shingle to put /none/ out front  sam a sign  liam flowers to make it look pretty  taliesin keyleth can you shape something  liam oh my god you look just like my sister you look just like me that is fucking weird  laughter  liam im going to go stand over by grog ill talk to you later never mind  matt you go walk over to grog and look up at a much larger slightly butcher version of yourself  staring down at you  liam yeah slightly completely butcher  laughter  travis whats up me  sam /none/ are we going to pose and start selling  laura i mean well set up shop and only sell to him  marisha i could also theoretically i just dont know well these things can see through other  things i could do hallucinatory terrain right around this and make us look like a little legit  kiosk with a little entrance incorporating your door  sam how much can you change the  marisha i can control it as much as i want  taliesin can you grow a gazebo  laura yeah but people will see the gazebo /town/ appear out of nowhere  taliesin its a magical tent  sam what do we need to sell people we just need a slab to put them up on to say look here  theres this one for sale  laura yeah but we need the mansion door to get him inside so were not going to have us outside  are we  sam yeah of course were going to have you guys outside how else are we going to convince him  that there is more good stuff inside  laura oh i understand  liam were the /none/ showroom window  taliesin can you grow a gazebo out of grapevines  sam or just a stone slab we dont need much lets not break the bank  marisha i mean i could do some druidcraft but thats minor growing a gazebo out of vines  thats plant growth i guess i could do plant growth fairly instantly without the full  because its a one or the other kind of a thing  laura i thought you said hallucinatory terrain  sam why do we need a fucking gazebo  laura lets just fucking stand here  liam /town/ we dont want to look like three card monte guys with a cardboard box  laura what if we danced  sam matthew what does everyone else have around them  marisha i still feel like if we are a crowd of slaves at a door  sam what are the other kiosks are there any  matt there are many scenarios in which you see people being sold you find elevated wooden  platforms you find metallic stages that are being lifted by slaves held up where the barker shouts  out among them there are all sorts of /none/ presentations each person is trying to shout over  the other many of the various humanoids and efreeti you see in the vicinity are all yelling  over each other and trying to catch attention its this weird constant barking almost auction  type atmosphere where its a lot of din noise music and voices shouting over each other its  also very crowded in this area there are a couple small parts theres like an alleyway nearby  where there is a little more of an opening like if there was a spot to set up it would be /none/ there  if not theres probably could traverse the rest of the vicinity of the slave market but currently  where you are thats the one space thats not too close to an existing shop  travis set up there  laura yeah set up there then grog you lift him up and make him look super tall and were doing  this around him  travis the celestial will sell itself we dont need anything fancy  liam in a row in a row  laura in a row doing the same move  marisha can i druidcraft some /none/ nice inviting looking bushes  travis shrubs  marisha shrubs yeah  matt sure which will definitely catch attention because no vegetation exists here for the most part  marisha never mind then  matt im just saying it would catch attention if you want people to look in your area  taliesin no it will be fancy i think it will be fancy  marisha what  taliesin plants where there are no plants is fancy  travis what  ashley and if a slave can do that thats pretty special  travis maybe we wait until we see /none/ him so we dont get unwanted buyers  ashley maybe you can do some flair as people are walking by  sam should we sit here and wait for a while  travis yup  taliesin lets keep an eye out why doesnt whichever one of us is the one that can be sneaky  and look around  liam we all need to be voguing  travis were staying together  laura well look as were voguing  taliesin all right all right  travis we wait to see if the pit fiend shows himself  sam can you /town/ guys all do like the robert palmer video  laughter  matt singing simply irresistible  laura do you want to give us instruments and well all play something  sam sure sure ill play a little ditty well jam to it  matt there is a series of smaller buildings in the area there is the main street that runs  through here and across that street is where there are many of the various slave blocks and larger  platforms set you guys find the entrance to this alley way which curves around behind you and there  /none/ is a large wall that leads to another section beyond that this is where you begin to set up or  where youre planning to set up shop so you guys wait there for a while looking about you can see  most of the people that are selling slaves there some of them are humanoid some of them are kobold  servants some of them are worse for wear looking like they are hoping to get sold soon before they  expire you do see across the way two young boys maybe about 15 or so years old light /none/ blue  laughter  matt no scanlan no  laughter  matt light blue skin and pupilless they are held by redcolored chains and they look broken of  spirit and they are both sitting with a hunch  laura aw can we get them go get them  sam poor nightcrawler  laura go get them and see if we can get them  travis are they celestials  sam i am going to go over there and buy these two kids for what  laura maybe and then we can set them free once were out of here /none/  sam all right  travis and taliesin what  travis no leave them alone  sam this isnt our fight  travis stay on target  sam do one of you want to go over there and say hi slave to slave  laura yeah ill go over there  sam yeah sure go on  matt okay vex by the way your alignments back up to chaotic good  laura oh fake sobs  matt that was the last little push there with that instance  liam i murder an old lady  laughter  liam welcome back /none/  matt all right so what are you doing  sam ill walk over with her so it doesnt seem weird that my slave is wandering around i  suppose i guess  laura yeah talk to the guy and ill talk to the slaves  sam they have an owner  matt yeah as you approach the two of them with the red chain around their necks and arms and they  are leaning over the edge of the small wooden platform looking dejected at the ground and  approaching them the skin itself is like a soft white /none/ porcelain with a slight translucent blue hue  to it white pupiless eyes they look human but they are beautiful and out of place here even in  their destitution you cant help but be struck by their presence both their chains are currently  locked to this stump that is in the center of this wooden platform and behind it you see this  grotesquelooking dwarf in very fine clothing that is very very dirty and old he stands there  clutching the edges of his lapel going all right weve got here before you two two i found /none/  and kept beneath my will for sale with angel blood within them  sam french accent hello i am slave master francois australia and i am curious about your two  angel boys  laughter  matt well if youre looking to purchase these will both set you back about 10000 gold apiece or  18 for the set  sam french accent what can they do i would be curious to find out  matt whispering whatever the fuck they can do i dont know i wasnt selling them for their  skillset i was selling them for /none/ their uniqueness  sam french accent how do you know anything about these boys how did you get them  matt whats it to you small one  sam french accent i like to see a chain of ownership so i know that the previous owner will  not hunt me down and kill me in the night  matt there is no previous owner i went and got them myself the chain of ownership is this chain  right here he points to the one on the stump you can see greasy black hair that is parted in  /none/ the middle mustache comes down into a weirdly fluffy beard that has weird oily portions of it  hes an awfullooking dwarf so are you going to buy or shall i wait for the ones im looking for  sam french accent which ones are those  laughter  matt piss off  laura whispering offer him 15 for the pair  sam french accent whispering merci normal volume would you take 15 for both of them  matt are your ears clogged i said ten each or 18 for the bundle  sam french accent yes but you dont /none/ seem to know where they come from who they belonged to  before its a risk that is possibly worth 3000 gold  matt make a persuasion check  liam this is how sam wooed me in 2008  laughter  sam is this persuasion solely 20  matt cash on hand 15 whispering dont tell anyone i said that  sam french accent oui oh slave can i have the gold  laughter  sam normal voice are we really going to do this  laura yeah we are going to buy them we are buying them  travis /none/ were taking in everything  laura theyre so young theyre innocents  taliesin and then we have extra slaves its beautiful  matt haha well its been fine doing business with you he puts the coins away pulls out a  piece of paper whats your full name  sam french accent francois bertrand jeanluc australia  laugher  matt here you are transference of ownership grabs the chains unhooks them takes the lock and  hands it to you theyre yours to take now you two shove off do what the man says  sam french accent do they /none/ have names  matt no its your choice to name them  sam au revoir  matt so as the two of you walk back with these two chained boys who walk behind you  laura do you speak common  matt stuttering yes  laura how did he find you  matt well we they both look at each other it doesnt matter its you who own us now  laura it matters dear  taliesin lets not have this conversation with them yet sister until all has been taken care of  laura ugh retching  travis i /none/ see why we got them now even better bait  laura come stand over with us  taliesin what sister

theyre talking keyleth you notice across the way the dwarf they had spoken to and  purchased these two from has packed up his things and looks around pulls a wand out does a large  circle and him and his kiosk vanishes  liam we fit right in  marisha see there are a lot of popup vendors here guys  taliesin good to know so if you summon your magical room  marisha maybe youll be more impressive  /town/ sam makes sense  travis can i survey the road in the direction of the embassy do we see anything  matt make a perception check  travis natural one  laura aw man  matt you look over in the

the alley  matt from what you can see currently no  marisha scanlan  sam oi  marisha do you want to come with me back /dung/ into the alley for a little bit and watch in case anyone  sees you could be giving me a good firm scolding just in case  laura scanlan should be visible at all times  marisha well it takes a minute to do the scrying  sam vax vex dont argue well get through this i mean im going to go back with you so  marisha stand guard ill be right back  sam sure ill stand watch  marisha i go back to a little dark corner and i pull out the scrying eye  taliesin pike /none/  ashley no

any questions without my permission do you understand  matt /none/ yes  ashley and dont be scared  matt okay  taliesin ive got a plan follow my lead this should be interesting  matt as you guys begin to wander off with the two boys keyleth you hold the scry crystal in your  hand and as you focus you see this flash of heat in your mind and then darkness again the spell has  no effect  laura hes not even here  sam or hes blocking it somehow  laura no i bet hes in the fucking nine hells right now  sam getting some money /none/ to go and come to the slave market  laura yeah hes probably sold all the people that were hanging out with him last time  matt just so youre aware the scry spell fails if theyre not on your plane of existence or if  they succeed their saving throw  sam ah  taliesin you can try again in ten minutes  marisha i can try again  taliesin im going to look around for something interesting  matt okay you begin to walk around you hear the barking of various heavythroated creatures you  come across this /none/ large it looks almost like a wolf or dog but the face is a little less  pronounced like a wolf and a little more humanoid in the front but it is still bestial and  monstrous the coat is gray and matted and you can see these long fangs protruding it barks and  snarls but every single time it reaches for the bars and the bars themselves look like a flimsy  wood but as it tries to tear at them or bite there is a spark of arcane energy and it backs up  and seems to /none/ recoil from the attack and begins to pace back and forth in its cage again  taliesin i try and discern who runs this establishment  matt you also see behind that there are two more cages that contain these very large insectlike  creatures that have very long bodies with multiple legs looks like a set of eight or so legs almost  like an oversized praying mantis the giant pincers in the front but they are currently  collapsed on the ground within their cages resting in the heat behind them you see an individual  that appears /none/ to be a similar racial background as senokir but is older with this red and graying  goatee that comes to a very defined point at the end of the chin and is currently sitting sipping  off of a wine skin and watching you slurp  taliesin most humble greetings good master  ashley ill bow as well  taliesin my sister and i have been sent by our owner to peruse the market for things that he  might enjoy and i have been asked to inquire upon the nature of what youre selling and your  suggested /none/ price never making eye contact  matt very well we have today and today only two ankhegs for sale mind you not bound the  will is yours to break and one barghest at the front the prices the ankhegs are 500 gold  apiece the barghest 8000 gold  taliesin my master is always interested in creatures of unusual disposition and he will be  excited to know what you have for sale i thank you for your time may i please leave your ive  lost my brain  matt yes please go  taliesin i bow i /none/ back off properly what are you feeding me in this cup  laughter  matt as time progresses and you guys have been wandering around eventually the image does come  across your mind as you wish to you wanted to scry again  marisha yeah whenever i can  matt okay still no success unfortunately  taliesin im making sure that the whole market knows that there is someone perusing and  purchasing for unusual creatures and making sure they see the weird twins and the two angelic im  making a show of it and im making a /town/ show of our nonchained obedience  matt as it progresses the actual twins you notice far up the way to where the arches begin  you see a sight youve been seeking this entire time you see a large deep red entity begin  strolling down the street with its burly rippling armored muscles its giant red wings flared out  behind it its horned head and crest piercing the sky behind it as its burning eyes and fanged jaw  and mouth he lumps forward with each step and as it does you begin to see the essence of /none/ the  necklace that had been described previously dangling around its neck  liam preemptive jenga  sam all right we go back to the sales area  taliesin were not going to hurry were going to meander so that maybe we get seen  ashley he gets a glimpse yeah  liam can i tell you something really quick i am super impressed with you that was very kind thats it  get ready  matt as you guys wait in the spot that youve chosen the pit fiend as youve rightfully  designated it at this point begins /town/ walking through and slowly making its way through the  crowd as it glances around you can see it strolling up to a few bars and running its claws  across you hear the clanking sound of it thank you criss angel you see it running its  claws across the bars with a heavy clanking it seems disinterested by many of the creatures that  it passes by  marisha should i do something theatrical magicky  sam ill play a song singing hot in the city hot in the city tonight tonight  matt make a perform check /none/  sam 23  matt heavy footsteps it begins to eventually cross paths with the alley where you guys are  situated it turns its head and looks down to you with your flaming beard and firewreathed head  playing your song it slows its gait ever so slightly it is an imposing and frightening  entity even just being in its presence even as you play the best you can you feel everything  almost slowed down in its proximity as its sheer immensity passes you leaving you in its shadow  for a momentary bit of time in /none/ that moment you feel the back of your neck stand on end all the  hairs immediately come to full point you feel cold and alone as it sets its eyes upon you it  moves its gaze beyond and continues walking  taliesin im going to walk by with the slaves  matt okay so you come by the other direction as you guys finish your meandering as you walk  by it footsteps stopping looks at the two boys that youve procured and slows  sam ill call out to percy french accent its no use no one /none/ has enough money for our slaves  forget it we should clean up and go home  taliesin of course master  ashley of course sir we tried so hard  matt the pit fiend has turned about and is standing there with its arms crossed watching  this transpire maybe halfway up the block where you guys had set up its eyes narrow with a bright  spark of yellow light that situates where its face is heavy footsteps it saunters up in your  direction looks over to where the rest of you are and where the two /none/  sam is he coming over  matt hes heading in your direction  sam okay ill summon the magnificent mansion door and ill say to the slaves  french accent all right it was worth a  try but we must pack it in  matt as youre saying this the pit fiend puts a hand up its mouth doesnt move but you hear a  voice piercing deep inside your head it says stop i have discourse to make with you small one  sam but of course i am here to sell if you are here to /none/ buy  matt i have interest with your aasimar  sam french accent they are for sale for a good price  taliesin ive already brought them into the mansion ive already handed them off and said  put them very far downstairs hide them  matt you bring them into the mansion  taliesin oh yeah ive brought them into the mansion and have put them downstairs the servants  are taking them down  sam french accent we have already packed up for the day but if this is a serious business  proposal well i can go /none/ in and fetch them  matt the creature leans down toward you the pit fiends very presence itself almost causing the  air to vibrate around you though it is not the largest creature that youve faced there is  something about its presence that is purely evil a bastion of power across all elements of the  cosmos that you havent had stare you down at this proximity as it leans forward the voice  once again pierces the center of your brain it would do well to bring them forth  sam french accent i cannot just communicate /none/ with them would you join me inside my shop there  you will see many other fine specimens  matt what is your price  sam french accent well you havent seen what i have to offer  matt i have seen enough  sam french accent so you are not interested in the naga the goristro the other celestial  beings

narrow it leans back as its head cocks slightly have you never  done business in this city before  sam french accent im afraid that i havent but if you are serious and it seems that you are  by the way that you are not moving your mouth  matt he /none/ begins walking away from you  sam french accent wait would you like to come inside with me and see them for yourself  matt it has completely written you off and is walking northward back from whence it came  travis quick throw a price out  sam french accent 30000 apiece  matt footsteps slows its gait turns around footsteps keeps walking  sam french accent 10000  matt it stops turns around and starts heading back toward you footsteps the voice once again  pierces this time even more intense more oppressive youve seen shadow youve never /none/  really felt it inside you before the voice itself presses against your will you hear it say your  price is acceptable you know the embassy is good to pay present the charges and i will take them  laura can i come out and bow before scanlan and say forgive me master for interrupting but  the female aasimar is fighting back  sam french accent well put her ugh im so sorry sir i must go deal

portal and they see across the way the pit fiend standing there with his  arms crossed they both gasps you hear the breath escape their lungs as the fear hits them  the pit fiends arms go lax you can see a bit of a smile on its face now /none/ it looks like its  pensive frustration in waiting has been expended the voice says you will be paid  sam all right  taliesin money first  sam i dont want to

travels forward like a slight ripple  almost like a miniature breaking of the sound barrier strikes across the air seems to collide  with the front of the pit fiend as it hits the energy fizzling dissipates not affecting its  /none/ form you watch as the pit fiend suddenly its attention  marisha he takes 4d6 psychic damage  matt he does  liam was scanlan walking toward him or had they gotten

of arcane energy splash across the torso and head of the pit  fiend and it steps onto its back foot and you all realize this is the jenga moment as youre  preparing to go into combat you watch as the pit fiend narrows its eyes and from immediately to  its left a small localized gateway tears open and out from it you watch a humanoid female with  large red feathered wings carrying some sort of glowing lasso or rope at her side armor and a /none/  large weapon with a bow slung across her shoulder flies out next to the pit fiend you rang  laura aw fuck  matt and thats where well pick up next
