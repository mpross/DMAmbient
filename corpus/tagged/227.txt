none	  matt everyone everyone  sam can we open our fricking books yet  marisha not yet  matt welcome to wildemount the year is 835 pd or postdivergence this continent is divided both  by jagged terrain and political powers the menagerie coast a collection of citystates  united under the clovis concord monopolizes the southwestern shores and ports of wildemount  thriving on open trade and cultural freedom beyond the cyrios mountains lies the massive  region known as wynandir bisected by the ashkeeper peaks eastern wynandir houses the  expansive wastes and turbulent badlands of xhorhas overrun 
none	 with all manner of beasts and  terrors relics from the final battles of the calamity that ruined that scarred landscape  northward you would find the greying wildlands a lawless realm harboring a curse that has kept it  unconquered by human hands however this story begins in the territory of western wynandir  within the boundaries of the dwendalian empire emerging 13 generations before the dwendalian  empire has slowly spread to encompass the surrounding societies of the region absorbing the  peoples of the zemni fields and the marrow valley before finally conquering the julous dominion and 
none	  taking the whole of western wynandir for the empire  sam there will be no test  matt no this is let me continue under the rule of the current king bertrand dwendal now in  his 68th year most are left to their own devices you live as you did before the crown only takes a  tithe of what you produce and earn you follow its laws worship its gods and bow to its installed  local leadership in return denizens of the empire are protected from the chaotic horrors and  shadowed evils that stalk the 
town	 edges of the civilized lands this accord has led to a  prosperous century for the empire or at least the political elite tensions brew beneath the  chafing watch of the crowns guard every temple is governmentowned and run and worship outside  the approved idolatry is met with imprisonment rumors of military clashes at the eastern border  near xhorhas have many common folk on edge our story however begins much smaller here in the  southern reaches of the marrow valley beyond the entry gates of the wuyun gorge lies the small  rural town of trostenwald 
town	 bordering the blue waters of the ustaloch this town came to  prominence near the turn of this recent century when the surrounding fertile farmlands were  discovered to produce a unique type of grain and wheat leading to a boom of breweries when the  glut subsided three large families stood triumphant in the local business of fermented  delights now trostenwald thrives on their exports of fish crops and ale here in this sleepy trade  stop along the amber road a handful of wandering destinies slowly begin to intersect  we begin in the early hours of 
tavern	 the morning on the day of grissen in a messy room on the second floor  of the nestled nook inn a blearyeyed bruised man in a tattered coat slowly wakens from his  lengthy sleep catching his small snoring ally curled at the foot of the bed liam if you would  like to describe your character please  nervous laughter  laura oh my god no pressure  sam were we supposed to prepare this  liam im pretty filthy i have a mess of reddishbrown hair and really filthy road  clothes i wear a long coat 
none	 that i slept in i slept about 20 hours last night jeez unshaven a  bit of a mess  sam so far youre just talking about current liam  laura what color are your eyes i need visual  liam theyre blue thats it it was a rough day yesterday and thats it  matt and your name is  liam oh caleb caleb widogast  matt all right as your smaller friend curls awake sam would you like to describe your  character  sam yeah um i am a little goblin girl  laughter  sam i 
none	 am a goblin so you know the green skin the green hair the yellow eyes and she wears  notgreat clothes just like her traveling companion there she hides in the shadows a lot  because she knows goblins arent welcome in this part and thats about it i mean shes a little  skittish and right now shes probably stirring awake as well right  matt well whats your name  sam oh nott the brave  matt so caleb as you come to consciousness you glance over and can see slowly snoring and  rousing at about the 
none	 same time notts eyes blink open her slowly groaning face looking over  towards you  sam highpitched cockney accent oh youre finally awake  i see oh yeah motherfuckers its on you were out for quite  some time there rough day eh  liam light german accent not our best day no  sam no i mean usually youre so good at everything but yesterday you were just maybe  you needed the sleep is what you needed  liam thank you  sam well dont thank me yet i should probably tell you what happened while you 
none	 were asleep i  mean you were asleep for so long i got bored frankly i was going through my pack and  reorganizing  liam has anybody seen you seen you seen you  sam well i mean many people i got bored youve never slept that long so i left i went  downstairs i thought id do a bit of windowshopping and you know how sometimes i get  the itch you know  liam i do did you make it back here okay at night  sam im here arent i  liam yeah you are 
town	  sam yeah i did but i might have been spotted by a few of the crowns guard  liam did you have the mask on  sam no no i didnt but they didnt catch me so listen im sorry sometimes i get the urge  ive got to take something you know i was trying to replentish what you lost yesterday and i failed  liam well we sighs discussed coming to a bigger town its going to be a little more  difficult now you cant go it was easier on outskirts it was easier in farms 
none	 but we cant do  that here  sam i know im sorry yeah i know youre right yep i just got a little bit squiggly  thats all  liam okay well i think today you should have the mask on at all times  sam yeah good idea caleb  liam its better when were working together if you need to steal something do it with my help  all right  sam yeah yeah of course yeah  liam back up the conversation a minute thank you i would not be alive if you had not you 
none	  saved my life so thank you  sam ah no problem  liam yesterday was really not great  sam yeah well well do better today right  liam sure sure we will are you hungry  sam yeah im starving  matt at this point you notice the gentle smell of cooked meats and promises of mediocre porridge  and eggs just barely begins to creep beneath the subtle floor of your room meet your nostrils  liam well nott what are we going to do today i can go down and get breakfast and bring it up 
town	  here at least i dont know i mean im a little wary of just splashing back into the town  right away  sam lets go down get some food ill come with you cause as you said were better together  and well take it from there you need some books and stuff right  liam always  sam all right well thats on the todo list  liam all right well lets get something to eat then  matt all right so you prepare yourself with your mask set over  sam yes yeah so i have 
none	 a half a mask that covers my goblin face and with the hood over  kind of obscures maybe its not a goblin maybe its a little halfling person or something  matt which is helpful the southern more rural region of the empire especially near felderwin  which is one of the largest tilling and farming areas of the entire empire has a very heavy  halfling population and so while this city is not the core of it youd probably see a larger 2025  of the population here in trostenwald is halfling so you pass off pretty 
tavern	 decently as long as you  keep away from discerning intent eyes so the two of you manage to gather your things for the time  being wander down the stairs from the top floor down to the base of the tavern which the air is  already bustling with townsfolk and all manner of travelers preparing to take on the days  responsibilities yorda the 40something woman barkeep with shoulderlength blonde hair and  weathered skin that you previously rented your room at the inn from frantically darts behind the  bar while the redheaded barmaid rushes from table 
tavern	 to table it seems that the clientele is a bit  more than they were expecting this morning yorda yells from behind the bar to the barkeep  adelaine two more brats and a bit of mush at the corner table she looks up im working on it  and she runs over and heads back to the kitchen theres a faint bit of music as two  slovenlylooking musicians in the corner are trying to work for tips with a small hat on the  floor that it looks like nobodys thrown any coin into it the tables are 
none	 fairly busy except for  maybe two that appear to be available between the two of you guys if youd like to find a seat  liam okay sure is that easy to do find a seat  matt yeah you walk over to it you sit down  laughter  liam is this how dd works  sam what do we roll for  laughter  matt you sit down and due to the chaos that ensues around you it takes a little while for  adelaine the redheaded barmaid to come by and she scoots by the table 
none	 im terribly sorry what  can i get you  sam you know meat if you have it but if you dont thats okay too potatoes or bacon if  its on the menu but really anything  matt i can get you all three its fine what you want  liam a trost for each of us please  matt for breakfast i like you all right two trosts and a bunch of meats be right back and  she rushes off she pulls her hair back and ties it as she goes into the kitchen getting ready for 
none	 the  midst of chaos while you guys have a moment there at the table you can hear conversation muttering  around you and you have a brief bit of privacy to discuss  liam yes i need books thats true but did you find drink yesterday  sam i have a little left in my flask  liam how much  sam just a couple swigs  liam so thats also on the todo list then  sam i mean if you dont want me to get too jittery yeah  liam all right okay so well do that 
none	 first  sam all right  travis i love her  laughter  matt a short time passes before the two platters are rushed over and scattered across the front of  your table with a clattering pile of meats there set for you a little bit placed on the side  because you might need especially with the look on your face adelaine gives you a glance and  goes put something in your belly comes back and slides two trosts to you  sam i remove my little mask and then just go eating noises  laughter  
none	 liam i take the last piece  matt as you guys are partway through your meal lets see this would be caleb you notice out of  the corner of your eye a gentleman enter the door looking kind of meek middleage looks  workhardened he has a heavy chinbeard that is unkempt and a bit wild but his eyes are warm  hes holding his hat in his grip and he scans the room with an eager glance before his face  brightens and he begins to push his way across the room in your direction it looks like 
none	 he  scoots over towards your table and as youre about to turn and see what hes about  liam im putting my hand on my purse  matt he pivots to the table next to you instead he turns to you three  yelps  laura weve just been sitting here this whole time  matt yeah youve met this man the day before rinaldo the fisherman who you had aided and as  he approaches he goes might i sit please  laura of course take a seat  sam whats that  matt as he sits down 
none	 in his chair i would ask each of you to please describe yourselves  starting with you laura  laura slavic accent oh well okay im just you  know a little blue tiefling thats all with blue hair  and im wearing a pretty cute dress thats all and im having a good time you know were just  having a good time here at breakfast  matt all right and you  marisha uh yeah yeah im you know simple girl simple needs just wearing nice baggy  clothes some monk vestiges theyre in nice blues and greys

none	 bone  laughter  travis green skin tone and got some piecemeal armor put together and stuff my names fjord  laura youre very handsome i just need to tell you  travis thank you appreciate that  matt as rinaldo sits down clutching his hat still in his hands says i thank you for your  time fjord and i apologize i forget your names  marisha beauregard  matt beauregard and  laura jester  matt jester thank you you all came when no one else would yesterday and because of you my  daughter is still alive 
town	  marisha oh yeah sorry for being a pessimistic asshole by the way when we first came into town  matt oh thats okay  marisha im not used to things turning out good  matt youll do well this side of the empire anyway i wont keep you but i we spoke  yesterday and i didnt have much to give you sent you away with nothing but my gratitude but  ive been asking around the other fishermen lochsmen and weve put together a little bit of  coin for your troubles so and he turns his cap 
tavern	 over on the table and this catches your  attention you hear this clattering of coin your eyes glance over especially you nott and watch  as he leaves this pile of what looks to be mostly copper and silver pieces with a couple of  glimmers of gold and as soon as it clatters across the hard wood table here in the center of  the tavern other faces begin to turn gather attention as to whats happening over here in the  back edge and he takes his cap back and pushes it forward towards all of you 
none	 his dirty you can see  cracked and very callused fingers shoving it in your direction before taking his hat and placing  it back over his head  laura so cool  liam those coins went all over the floor  matt all over the table i hope its helpful but thank you  marisha yeah yeah oh wait  travis we cant accept this right i mean its too much  marisha were supposed to at least say that right and then still accept it right  travis i think youre supposed to do it if you say 
none	 it  laura well i mean he did go around to a bunch of people that was a lot of work on his part i  would hate to make him go back to all of those people and give it back to each individual  person  travis fine fine  marisha if he didnt keep a ledger you know we wouldnt want to do that its rude not to accept  a gift right its rude not to accept a gift right  matt i would hope that is the case anyway thank you very much i am 
tavern	 sorry for getting in  your way and he stands up and gives you all a nod and rushes out of the tavern a little  embarrassed by all the attention thats now placed on him by the other patrons and as he leaves  everyone goes back to their business a couple of wandering eyes starting to count what coins are  there as you slowly mitt them in your direction  laura divide it up  marisha okay okay  matt there are four gold pieces amongst the pile 22 silver and 48 copper pieces  travis can 
none	 i clock the room see who else is watching her count  matt perception check 48 copper  travis is this the first roll  matt first roll of the campaign  travis natural 20  cheering  matt and thats how you start it all right  laura so im leaving it to you to do that counting which is really hard for me personally  but there you go  marisha how do you split up four gold we have four gold and theres only three of us  laura dont know  travis well i actually did 
dung	 pretty good at that card game so you can have mine  marisha aw i will okay  laura so two for each of us thats great  marisha oh thats good one for you two for me two for oh wait no wait math doesnt  make sense  sam shes your treasurer  matt this is going to go great  laura its hard not being the treasurer  marisha ill give two to jester one for you one for me and then 22 silver thats  laura tell you what you do that math  matt while 
none	 youre counting this out and figuring out the division of your gains fjord you glance  about narrowing your orcish eyes across the room and you can see two other tables there are some  gentlemen who are peering over and as soon as they meet your gaze they go right back to their  business and completely shrink away theres a man and a hooded figure at a table immediately  adjacent to you the man looks rather filthy his hair a bit unkempt and hes trying to finish his  drink however the smaller halflinglooking figure is just 
none	 glaring intently and is slowly  leaning in the direction of the table  travis thats creepy fucking disgusting i think we have people watching us  laura who is watching us  travis well just take a look right over there  sam dont arouse suspicion but did you hear all that coin hit that table caleb  liam i did its on the table though so i think on the table it will stay  sam yes but we could follow them out we could do the moneypot we could run rat food we could  do prince 
none	 and the pauper to get it from them we could try spider eyes any of those could work  laura are you guys staying here  matt this blueskinned tiefling suddenly leans over to you at the table  sam dont move dont move tieflings can only see movement  liam i dont think thats true  laura its very true we have a hard time seeing things that arent moving its very true but i  can hear you you should take a bath you know they have showers here its possible  liam a what now  laura 
none	 you bathe yourself in water  liam no ive bathed before yeah i know what a bath is  laura its because you smell really bad and its wafting over this direction im just letting you  know i would hate if i smelled that bad and someone didnt tell me  liam ive only just met you  laura hi im jester  liam hi im caleb  laura nice to meet you caleb how much silver did i just get  marisha seven  laura woo  laughter  marisha and 16 copper arent you all jealous

none	 to the skin and  with the little words that have poked through her lips you can see what appear to be teeth more jagged  than expected of the halffolk  marisha i just shout over and i say good morning in halfling  sam i know halfling right yes ill shout back top of the morning to you  laughter  marisha would you like a coffee id love to buy you a coffee  sam weve got free coffee yeah yeah ill take it sure thank you  travis youre being mighty fucking friendly they were looking

none	 matt eventually adelaine comes by and brings two fresh trosts to the table glancing about at the  unique tension in the air right here would you like anything as well  laura oh yes lots of baked goods if you have them please  travis pork belly if you have it  marisha i dont think ive seen you eat anything other than pastries  laura i really like them  marisha im kind of concerned for your wellbeing its fine im not that concerned  eat whatever you want ill have bacon some ham whatever  matt all

none	 in you notice one of them begins to step from table to table glancing about with a  sort of grace to the movement the other staying a few feet behind taliesin if youd like to  describe your character please  laura i didnt think we were going to meet you so soon  taliesin neither did i  ashley i didnt either  taliesin but here we are a lavender damn it travis a lavender tiefling with red eyes and very  pierced extremely ostentatious horns that are pierced with little gems and little baubles hes  got 
dung	 a tattoo that seems to be running up the side of his face a peacock tattoo that goes off into  his very ostentatious ridiculous overblown robes that he wears his two swords and pouch dangling at  the side of his hips hes very broad in his dress  liam so a literal and figurative peacock  taliesin oh yes  travis one of your characters no  taliesin i know mine who knew  matt as this tiefling darts from table to table a few feet behind you see  ashley wait did you say your name  
none	 taliesin i didnt say my name  ashley okay so there is a woman behind him taller than your average lass  laughter  ashley shes very very very paleskinned her hair is black that starts to turn white as it gets  longer its matted its dreaded its braided her clothes are a bit tattered but just sort of  shes a bit of a mess and she has two different color eyes one of them is a light greenishblue  and the other is a violet color and shes very standoffish hunchy arms folded  matt you watch 
none	 as these figures slowly move from table to table the tiefling engaging in some  distant conversation leaving a slip of paper walking to the next table gauging the atmosphere  not leaving a slip of paper and quickly moving on and then eventually your eyes meet what looks  to be two tables with a very motley crew of individuals that are both awkwardly avoiding their  own tension and currently trying to figure you out  taliesin can i tell if where are they in the dispensement of the coin can i tell they have a  little 
none	 coin on them did i catch any of that  matt theyve completed distributing so you dont see any coin unfortunately  taliesin well i dont believe ive ever seen a group of people more in need of a good time in my  entire life mollymauk tealeaf of the fletching and moondrop traveling carnival of curiosities if  there was ever a group of people that needed a good time to go out have a laugh see things that  you have never seen before and my god take my word for it one months time people will be

none	 yes matts got to make cat sounds now  matt i didnt even think about that until now god damn it all right so as you guys have  gathered at this point the oranges and the pinks of dusk begin to peek through the quitecloudy  sky the chilled air of the coming night sky signalling the crowns guard to begin lighting the  hanging lanterns that line the streets of trostenwald a renewed energy takes the streets as  the sound of a fiddle seems to creep through the night air  sam my god ashleys a master 
none	 fiddler isnt she  ashley beedledeedle  laughter  travis i love how your fiddle noises were beedledeedle  ashley thats the sound for all instruments right  sam drums  liam by the way dm can i ask sometime in the entire day when nott was getting wasted could i  have spent an hour using arcane recovery to gain back that one spell slot i used this morning  matt sure yeah ill allow that all right folks begin to prod their heads out into the open  air curious about the source of this unusual din and 
town	 you find your vision capturing a small  procession of flamboyantly dressed people parading through the central road a lanky man of some  obvious elven descent leads the pack his long ashybrown hair curling eversoslightly past his  midback his long coat and tails knocking around by his skipping step two halfling women in purple  and green bodysuits dance from side to side handing flowers to children and flyers to adults  as a bald man in a neckfrilled frock coat of bright red his face adorned in vibrant orange  makeup to look like the setting sun 
none	 behind him plays the violin that you heard earlier in an  upbeat jovial manner a tall halforc masculine man with a wellgroomed handlebar mustache that  curves out to the side billowing white silk shirt and black trousers follows behind with a big drum  slung over his shoulder going drumming along with the fiddle the tiefling man of lavender skin that you  saw earlier walks along with a grin juggling two curved scimitars as he walks in place almost  loses one and catches it continues to go families are beginning to gather out to see this 
dung	  display the two dancers part and then a woman of short fiery red hair and dark skin walking  between them lifting a small candle before fwoosh a giant burst a gout of flame emerges  from the front of her mouth brightens the vicinity and everyone collectively gasps and  begins cheering and clapping as they continue the walk there to the back of it you see the rather  burlylooking pale woman arms crossed just following behind and keeping an eye like a  security guard to ensure that no business gets out of hand the gasps 
none	 and the cheers begin to follow  and as the procession continues down its way the families and civilians begin to gather and follow  behind as the last bit of the sun sets behind the mountain range the torches glowing the  procession curves through the center of the loch ward to the edge of the ustaloch itself through  the fishing village more folks begin to gather do you all follow  all yeah  laura and i cast blessing of the trickster on you again just in case  sam thank you  matt people following the 
dung	 parade you see faces eager for this fresh form of entertainment  children laugh and chatter excitedly while the crowns guard in their familiar bronze and  vermilion uniform try to maintain order between themselves being quite curious or visibly  mistrusting of these hooligans that suddenly have usurped the evening air the procession continues  towards the eastern side out along the southern edge of this loch ward to the ustalochs  southern place towards the new completely constructed large dark blue tent lengthy  streamers of white and silver flap with the cold winds from the top of 
none	 the structure as you guys  walk you watch as the horned tiefling you had approached earlier slowly saunters up to your  side you recognizing these individuals you had spoken with earlier  marisha i go molly molly hey  taliesin oh its my favorites hello  laura we came  taliesin im so glad you all came to see the show its going to be great tonight  ashley deadpan its going to blow you away  laughter  sam the hype continues  ashley youre going to love it  taliesin first show of a rounds always

town	 the night air walk slowly we need just a moment to set up and  the halfelf man bows and tips his large it looks almost like a top hat that gets floppy  towards the top and flops forward and he puts it back on top and begins sauntering continuing the  music but picking up their pace to get ahead of the crowd as they draw you all slowly towards the  exterior tent and thats where were going to go ahead and take our break  yelling  travis face is on fire  laura am i

none	 play with it this is nice  taliesin very nice  ashley i like it  sam its a falchion  laura youre going to hang out with us the whole night  ashley ill hang out beside you so you can watch  matt make a perception check  travis 11  matt 11 thats enough as she spins the falchion around you notice that affixed to her back in  uncharacteristically clean leather towards the rest of her outfit what appears to be a  slungover sheath and a very large bladed weapon larger than your falchion affixed 
none	 to her back  marisha i just like how everyone says falchion  liam its pronounced felching  laughter  taliesin im going to pick up my cards in a very specific order very quickly and start stacking the deck  ashley all right well if you want to follow me ill take you to your seats and ill stand beside  you the whole time  travis fucking lead the way  taliesin hey jester before you go tiefling to tiefling and thank you for keeping this rabble in check  laura of course you know theyre a lot

none	 to the rest of them  taliesin such grace such form such dignity  travis the birds are out already  matt at which point the other bo bo the breaker goes ahead and collects five copper from  each of you as you pass through so mark off five copper except for the two of you you guys are  part of it  laura if i skip around will i be part of the show and then i dont have to pay  taliesin weirdly being part of the show means you strangely pay more im not entirely 
town	 sure how  that works  liam nott do you have five copper  sam for you caleb i do  liam no im not asking i was going to help you but if you have it youre good  sam no youve been spotting me all day ill take care of both of us  ashley mollymauk that jesters adorable  taliesin i know highly entertained  ashley i like her  taliesin i do too  matt so stepping into the interior of the tent the rocky floor filled with grass and dirt and  various flattened groundscape 
dung	 on the outskirts of the ustaloch you can see a thick heavy  tarplike material hitting the very edge where the heavy dark blue cloth hangs from the sides of the  tent youre within you can see where the seating is guided across the floor and there already in a  very packed room you see a few dozen townsfolk that have begun to gather in a semicircle there  is the entrance flap of the tent where you guys are walking in as soon as you walk in you can  see a central pillar a heavy column 
town	 of wood a tree that has been completely rounded off on all  sides held aloft to carry the top of the canopy of the tent itself and across the way you can  see a larger flap tent that is currently closed that appears to be probably the performers  entrance you can see above you four hanging lanterns that glow with what seems like a flicker  of light but the pattern to them is consistent meaning its not probably natural flame children  and people are beginning to mash around the sides and the space along the 
town	 edges of the interior of  this tent is starting to get a little cramped where do you guide them yasha  ashley did you guys want to sit in the front row  sam thats what we were told is the best seat in the house  ashley we want to sit in the front row  matt so theres if you consider a semicircle pattern here theres if youre entering you  can go front to the right front to the left front to the center anywhere in between where  would you like to be currently sitting 
none	  ashley front and center or do you want to be on the sides  laura front and center  ashley i take them to the front and center  matt front and center okay  liam im going to keep my hand on my meager purse for the evening  matt okay  laura as soon as i sit down im going to pull out my sketchbook and draw the moon and the shadow  card that molly showed me  marisha as were walking over i say hey yasha cause i was totally on your shoulder heard you 
none	  talking about my friend jester  ashley ah shit  marisha yeah  ashley i didnt mean anything by it i just  marisha no dude no shes never mentioned a significant other so i mean  ashley oh im not looking for anything i just  marisha will you hold me through the show  laughter  marisha like cradle me  ashley thats an extra charge we do do that though  marisha how much  ashley well its an extra five gold pieces  marisha five gold  ashley these arms are worth a lot  
none	 taliesin its a very swaddling hug youve never experienced anything like it  ashley its the best way to see the show if thats how you want it  marisha ill give you five silver just to have your shrug to sit on so my butts not on the floor  ashley i dont take off my shrug  marisha oh sorry  ashley how about you just keep your money and ill put you in a chair and ill just watch over  your weapons  marisha okay  matt so she places you on the ground as there 
town	 are no chairs  ashley on the ground i mean because theres no chairs  laura oh theres no chairs aw i was picturing benches thats okay  travis theres no benches oh fuck  matt where are they going to transport benches from place to place  ashley thats a good point  travis carnival i dont know  laughter  matt well sorry you have fletching and moondrop to deal with  taliesin bring a cushion from home like a regular person  matt so as the music has died down and everyone begins to crowd in and 
town	 whisper to themselves  eventually it begins to quiet a bit everyone having their seats the familiar sound of the  fiddle begins to play and everyone quickly gets quiet down to a hush the music seems sourceless  in the interior of the tent everyone begins to look around to see where it may come from you  hear points of hushed looks pointing off in different areas and at the top of the tent you  see seeming to stretch and fall like a slow drop of water the man in red you saw earlier descends  from 
town	 the top of the tent but now dressed headtotoe in a matching deep blue outfit and  full makeup to where he appears out of the canopy of the tent he hangs from a rope by one foot  its wrapped around and clutched as his foot catches the edge playing his violin  eversoslowly as he carefully descends and then at the last moment releases the rope and lands on  his feet continuing the music hes playing he slowly spins as the longerhaired elf leader of  the earlier parade that you saw the one that had marked 
town	 back briefly to your two new friends over  here enters the tent from the distant flaps the performers entrance his head now sporting that  same tall hat flopping backwards at the apex he extends his arms removing the hat and takes a  deep bow as the crowd begins to clap  applause  matt ladies and gentlemen of trostenwald i am carnival master gustav fletching and allow me to  welcome you to the fletching and moondrops traveling carnival of curiosities  applause  matt i ask you each and every one of you you hear some 
town	 children giggle as he makes eye contact  grant us your imaginations this eve but a trifle bit of time and allow us to reveal a realm  of laughter mystery danger and beauty i see youve already met desmond and he gestures  towards the man in all blue whos playing the fiddle hell be part of our story tonight so  keep a wily eye for the shifting fool but first i tell you a tale of two sisters of the fey and  as desmond slowly leaves the tent you see two armored guards by where he 
none	 is now have entered  two of the crowns guard are stepping by the entrance where he walked in watch him pass lost  without form into the mazes of the underworld there where the body would break they found a  teacher in a mystical serpent and the gift they received was the ability to bend with this maze  that captured them and slither their way back to the surface to reclaim their place in the world  may i present to you mona and yuli the knot sisters as he slowly backs through the  performers entrance 
town	 the two halfling dancers you saw earlier in the full bodysuits emerge from  behind the carnival master as he discreetly exits they sport serpentine makeup scales affixed to  the sides of their face and arms approaching the central spire the pole that holds the tent up  one immediately leaps onto the shoulders of the other bending her back a nearimpossible amount  creating this humanoid sculpture that you see the front row cringe at the idea of the pain that  would cause an average individual but these halflings are very nimble and able to create  
none	 almost a single form out of two bodies their rigid form becomes fluid to the eye as they move  and shift to the music the violin now sourceless once again not seeing where this desmond is  placed but they seem to move as it picks up speed  laura whispers its like the serpent we fought you guys  sam i was expecting more ringling brothers actually  laughter  matt suddenly the top one folds over and slams into the ground tumbling across the center in a  wild display of physical control the two of them 
none	 begin to tangle and wrap like two battling snakes  their bodies seemingly disconnecting from the rigid halfling forms you had seen and you swear  for a moment becoming serpentinelike as they intertwine around the base of this pole its  beautiful and violent at the same time its offputting and watch as they curl around the  base of this pole the lights above begin to become a dull greenishblue and get darker and  darker presenting this imagery of the underworld one by one they silently tell a tale of struggle  crawling across one then the 
dung	 other one at a time using their serpentinelike forms as an  extending ladder folding over each other as they use every muscle in their body to cling around  this pole and ladderstep up like a snake its a very strange but alluring sight and you cant  help but notice that you forget that these are two halfling girls and you find yourself pulled into  this wordless story they tell of climbing back to their place to the surface towards the dark sky  of lightless blue cloth as the baubles that contain the interior light of 
town	 the tent begin to  glow brighter and brighter their climbing becomes more fevered the two of them arm into arm leg  into leg rolling up and swirling until eventually at the apex they grab each others arms  around the pole before spinning downward backtoback legs outward with a rapid pace the  music coming to a full crescendo like a maypole they both curl and twirl and then tumble to the  ground before the audience with a flourish arms in the air and the audience erupts in applause  applause  matt as they both begin 
none	 to back away smiles on their faces nodding to each other gustav emerges  once more from the performers flap the fool appears at the back entrance again taking an  ominous tune with his violin this time his outfit no longer blue but deepset black the hanging  lights darken once again as gustav takes the center stage in a flash beyond the ash the  gods all went and gone the darkness came to grasp reclaim and suffocate the dawn suddenly  out of the darkness behind him a burst of flame lights the room but from that 
town	 night a burning  light doth keep back shadows bane the strength to fight will set alight the morning sun again  ladies and gentlemen i present to you ornna the fire fairy and gustav leaves the tent once more  as you watch a pair of metallic fans alight with flame now frame the beautiful woman of short red  hair you had seen before in the procession gustav slinks into the darkness and vanishes as ornna  spins in hypnotic twirl her simple dress of golds and reds almost glowing in the firelight around  her the flickering 
dung	 of the flames giving her the visage of a warriorgoddess battling the dark that  surrounds the frenzied fiddle of the fool picks up as she twirls the fans in her grasp her face  stoic and graceful simultaneously the hushed awe of the audience fills the air watching this  magnificent warrior strike at the shadows the lights above flickering brighter with each spin  and dive banishing the shadows from the room she matches the pace of the music drawing to a  crescendo and leaps and barrelturns and climaxes with her striking a powerful pose as the 
town	  lights rocket to a victorious luminescence once again the crowd goes crazy  applause  laura this is really different than most carnivals that ive gone to  sam its very artistic yeah  matt gustav enters as she exits with a bow the fans flickering out he enters clapping at ornna a  low drumbeat begins to beat in the distance as the fiddle grows tense once more even as the sun  would rise anew bellowing roars will quake the lands of xhorhas and beyond terrible beasts now  freed from their dark masters scattered into our 
none	 world roars a terrible guttural roar shakes  the room followed by the sounds of grinding and dragged chains from behind the performers flap  the halforc bo who youd met earlier the breaker and the fool who is now still playing  the fiddle yet the bow of it continues to go on its own as he drags the other chain with his arm  wrapped around his forearm the two of them pull something through the flap it swells and from  beneath it is revealed an enormous creature of green scales slimylooking skin and a corpulent  
town	 form large toadlike legs frame a rotund torso and muscular arms that are manacled and pulling  him in it fights and wrestles against the taut chains as its pulled further and further towards  the center of the tent but is held in place by the two men it roars a second time roars the  front row immediately pulling back and screaming you hear kids begin to cry a handful of townsfolk  shoot to their feet grasping the children in fear preparing to run  laura have we ever seen anything like this before  marisha yeah 
none	 whats it look like  laura well he just described what it looked like  marisha by name  matt you have not seen this creature gustav continues seemingly unflinched by its approach  the deviltoad crawls hungrily  sam but what does it look like  laughter  matt into the land of the free folk lording over nightmares as they say and what truth lies  behind the eyes of this beast what would be learned when the guiding heart of innocence  pierces the hateful soul and brings it to see beauty for the first time i 
none	 present to you the  vivid voice of toya and as gustav backs away the deviltoad struggling against the chains a  soft faint voice begins to slowly emanate from the air  a voice appears in the background music  exclamations  matt eyes previously locked on the frightening creature now seek a source and find atop a  platform within the chamber high up on a small platform set against the apex of the pole a young  dwarven girl maybe 12 years of age her braided golden hair clasped and her hands at her side a  
town	 white dress obscuring her feet she sings with a mystifying mature voice that pierces your hearts  with joy unexpectedly and uncontrollably the crowd audibly gasps as one the entrancing song of  this girl bringing every person into this music the deviltoad stops struggling against the  chains seemingly caught by the sound of her voice its face drops into a soft smile as it  slowly walks towards the base of the pole and sits the halforc and the fool drop the chains and  back away leaving the beast free in its rapture her voice almost begins 
none	 to summon a chorus from  the ether magical in nature as there are no others but her joining into this piece her smile  is infectious and you cant tear your eyes away you only now realize the tears down your cheeks  but you cannot break your gaze from the front row of the audience on the left a man stands up his  arms outstretched towards her his dirtied cloak falls away his face and skin wracked with age  you see his legs shaking as he stands his cheeks wet with tears he shouts exclaims his 
none	 arms  drop and clutch his chest gurgles a burst of vocal pain once more and folks nearest to him begin to lean  away as he begins to shake you glance over as the old man yells out once more as the skin on his  arms suddenly begins to tear the bones splitting from the flesh writhing cracking dust and blood  shake from his wounds as his form swells screams begin to ring out from the audience around him  people rising up and running for the exit chaos breaks into the room around you toyas song

none	 the way and begins crawling across the ground as it goes for a second attack that  however does hit its a 16 thatll do it so with eight points of bludgeoning damage it  reaches down and slams its fist into her chest and as it does she gives out this horrible yelp  as it rips into her and begins gnawing into her flesh and pulls away with a mouthful of it and  stands up its eyes scanning the room for the next possible victim its going to begin to stalk  forward coming up to that 
none	 guy all right yasha your turn  ashley okay how close am i to them i want to give them their weapons  matt youre right there youd have to youre pretty close to everybody you could distribute  you could use your action to toss the weapons out to everybody this turn ill say  ashley okay ill pass my weapons out this turn  matt okay so youll spend your action throwing them out to the individuals so your shortsword  and crossbow clatter to the ground and you quickly scramble to grab them calebs dagger  falls

none	 creature as crystals form where the  wound and impact was it cracks back into place where it was end of your turn all right nott  youre up  sam okay having seen the beautiful dwarven girl was it who sang and soothed a monster  earlier in the show im going to attempt to sing and soothe this monster so i step forward and i  open my mouth and i sing singing badly and i will always soothe you  laura can i shoot an arrow at nott  liam hes killing the memory of scanlan

none	 go oh fuck that i dont know if thats true and im going to do a flurry of blows  and do two poppop thats unarmed right poppop  matt that is correct  marisha i do two right  matt yes if youre using your ki point to do that yes  marisha yes i am so first one its plus six okay first one is 19 no 20 first one is 20  total and then the second one is 15 total  matt both hit roll damage for each  marisha okay not great  sam what 
town	 are those dice  marisha theyre d4s theyre just fancy d4s yeah that is four eight 11 points of damage  matt between both great so after the grapple fails and it pushes you away you go ahead and  pull back and then leap kick it in the chest and then uppercut it in the chin  marisha yeah thats cool  matt looks back towards you so that would be putting you up basetobase with it there all  righty ending your turn okay at that point the crowd is now screaming and begins to swell and  
town	 push in this direction these folks all begin to run back and around this way this crowd begins to  push the guards are trying to push forward and they can only get a little ways forward to there and  there everyone just shifts out this direction  laura god somebodys going to get trampled  sam its really a hazard they should have had more exits  laura i mean its a fire hazard for sure  matt caleb and nott i need you both to make dexterity saving throws  sam 15  liam oh pretty good 
town	 that is 17 for me  matt all right you both manage to just bob and weave through the crowd to prevent being trampled  and backing away from the chaos as people are pushing through the entrance is too small for  everyone to leave and theres now a giant bottleneck thats beginning to push up as people  are now screaming and trying to get out theyre crying and the chaos is just swelling into this  absolute cacophony as soon as that finishes the deviltoad carrying the dwarven girl who was  given a decree exits out 
none	 back with her to get her to safety these two begin to slowly back away  seeing that things seem to be handled and the guards making their way in are looking scared at  each other not really knowing what to make of the current chaos at that point you watch as the  woman whose chest was torn into by this creature suddenly  groaning  matt snaps up into place  laura oh shit okay we have to keep them from being dead  matt top of the round jester youre up  laura oh god  
town	 matt what was your initiative again  taliesin ten  matt ten oh shit thats right youre with nott thats what happened so molly you go ahead  and go for your turn as well my apologies  taliesin im going to yell to the back open the tent wide and im going to pull how far away am i  matt youre right there youre in the middle of the crowd as its swarming around you and yasha  taliesin sighs im going to run around and see if i can flank that creature if i can move  
none	 towards flanking that creature with the other two  matt you cant really flank it but you can get next to it  taliesin all right can i get close enough to take a shot  matt you can yeah  travis take a shot  sam you have guns  taliesin well old habit  laughter  taliesin as a bonus im flipping it out and im going to activate the first sword  matt okay so you watch as molly pulls the scimitar out and as he unsheathes it draws it  across the side of his exposed 
none	 chest causing a little bit of blood to spill out and as it does  he pulls the blade out and you watch as the edge suddenly ice crystals begin to build on the outside  of the blade  taliesin and im taking a shot at the creature  sam taking a shot  taliesin taking a slice  laura taking a stab  sam but with bullets  taliesin thats 21 to hit  matt that hits  taliesin thats not bad thats eight points of damage and one point of ice damage  matt okay so nine 
none	 points of damage on the first strike  taliesin no that was my bonus  matt that was your bonus thats all youve got okay so one strike you cut across and you watch  as you cut this wide wound open exposing the fleshy organs interior but theyre frozen where  the wound cut through and its still holding it together its looking like its starting to hurt  a bit and fall apart slightly  sam this is the bigger monster  marisha so its the one im fighting  matt yes so that ends your turn molly 
none	 brings us to the top so jester sorry back to you  laura oh now im worried im worried about the undead i dont know well i dont think i  would know this so its okay im going to say to the air and say dude are you here because this  is like the coolest shit weve ever seen and then im going to cast toll the dead on the first zombie  creature guy and theres a bell that tolls  matt toll the dead  marisha oh thats fucking rad dude  laura he has to 
none	 make a wisdom saving throw or take 1d12 necrotic damage  matt natural one go ahead and roll a d12  laura oh three thats lame  matt three points of necrotic damage so as this deep temple bell rings out in the air above you  watch as this creature who has turned and is beginning to just whale upon the surrounding  allies that are curling at its sides it seems to retract from the sound and cover its ears briefly  before angrily lashing out  laura and i made that sound like it was coming from 
none	 my duplicate and my duplicates going to run  back a little bit and stand next to the pole yeah  matt cool is that your turn all right the standing creature thats now been sliced  bludgeoned and wounded by all three of you is going to go ahead and make two strikes at roll  randomly to see who it goes for thats going to be at beauregard it swings at you twice both  with its giant massive clawed fists just striking out towards you first one is 17 to hit  marisha my armor class is 
none	 17  matt nine points of bludgeoning damage as the first one just slams you in the chest you feel  the wind knocked out of you for a brief second the second swings going to come at you thats  going to be a 20 to hit  marisha yup yup that hits  travis this things swinging hard holy shit  matt and thats going to be six points of bludgeoning damage to you  liam what are you at girl  marisha dont worry about it im bad  matt it slams into you once with the 
none	 fist and the other one grabs into your stomach abdomen  region and the claws dig in and its jaw unhinges and drops like a snakes  marisha i turn to fjord and i go im not a claque this shows bullshit  matt the other one is going to rush over towards you mollymauk as youre the closest one to it  and is going to take one swing at you  taliesin yeah no im going to use blood maladict  matt okay so youre using a reaction you dont have to roll anything for it he just 
none	 has  disadvantage on the strike  taliesin oh thats right because im not doubling it up  matt thatll do it he rolled a 16 and then a four so as it swings towards you you watch as  suddenly the reddish burning eyes of the second creature go black and it goes way too wide and  misses you you easily duck out of the way of its first strike as it runs past towards you this  way you get an attack of opportunity as it leaves your attack range to attempt to swing around molly  
none	 for a second strike go for it  travis that is 16  matt 16 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis nice that is 12 points of damage  matt with this brief opening as it rushes past mollymauk after its eyes go black you watch as  it stumbles its vision ruined with that moment you swing out with your falchion thank you  yeah its falchion thats right and strike across the back of its shoulder you see what once  was this beautiful young woman is now this swollen horrible undead form lumbering past and 
none	  you cut a heavy chunk of meat off of its shoulder it curves around and makes a second strike at you  mollymauk this one without advantage thats a natural 19 yeah thats a 24 to hit all right  you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as the first one you manage to move out of the way  and as you spin your scimitar around you glance over just in time to have it clock you right  across the jaw your vision blurs and doubles for a second thats going to end their turn yasha  
none	 youre up  sam all right yasha  ashley can i get to the big beast beast number one okay so this is the first time ive done  this so hopefully i wont do this wrong  i would like to rage  cheering  ashley im going to workshop it ill make something later for now its a placeholder  okay i would like to rage and reckless attack  matt yeah you can reckless attack any of your attacks  sam is that something you can do right away that sounds like a later thing  ashley

town	  sam google reported a weird influx of falchion searches  laughter  ashley 13  matt on the one thats already been damaged  ashley yeah the first guy  matt yeah all right  ashley get the fuck out of my tent  laughter  matt yeah no it does not make the save it rolled yeah so as you come down with your blade  and carve through its body you watch as it curls back trying to reform and hold itself but your  blow was too strong and its zombieish form cannot maintain a cohesive 
none	 hold on its form and  you watch as it just crumbles to the ground no longer moving  cheering  sam yasha  ashley okay okay okay  matt okay that ends your turn as youre there growling animalistically towards the creature  ashley ooh that feels fun  matt you have about five more feet of movement if you wanted to move  ashley okay so im going to go a little bit closer to wait how many more are left just  the other one yeah so ill get ready for the other one so a little 
none	 bit closer to it  matt all right that ends your turn yasha fjord youre up  travis shit ill turn and head towards other treezombie fuck i would like to use my  bonus action to cast hex on it  matt okay so you watch as fjord lumbers towards it his large armored halforc form holding the  blade in his hand puts his hand out and the shadows suddenly swirl and gather around this  zombified womans form and cling to it like its holding it in place so with it now hexed what  would you 
none	 like to do  travis i would like to use my falchion to open it the fuck up  matt all right go for it  travis 21  matt that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage  travis thats 12 points of damage plus five points of necrotic damage  matt 17 points of damage  liam level two thats major  matt so as you rush up after the shadows gather around it it looks up to you and it pulls back  ready to strike and you just shake your head and one large swipe of 
town	 your falchion carves this giant  mark across its chest where the cloth and flesh opens you can see this blackened interior where  the muscles are trying to move almost like worms to regather and tighen all right that ends your  turn that brings us to caleb  liam all right i know that its restricted movement but i will push this way through the  crowd so that i have a clearer shot as far as i can and then i will reup with chromatic orb  matt you can push right about there you just barely 
town	 pull through the crowd to the front to get  a clear  laura hi caleb  liam i certainly dont want to do that i want to stay in the crowd behind people and i will do  chromatic orb again but this time im going to set it to acid so see if it hit oh thats not good  its 11  matt 11 unfortunately does not hit so as you pull it out a second time youre pushing through  the crowd and you pull up your diamond and right as youre about to release the 
town	 spell one of the  people in the crowd slams into you with her shoulder and you get jarred off to the side the  acid bolt of the chromatic orb flies off and actually burns a hole through the distant tent and  then vanishes into the night sky  liam hope that didnt hit anyone  matt all right that ends your turn caleb nott youre up  sam do i have eyes on the biggie is fjord right next to her  matt fjord and mollymauk are both next to it yes  sam all right im 
none	 going to peek out behind whatever patron im next to take out my little  crossbow and just shoot a little shot  matt all right go for it  travis is it made of piano wire  laughter  sam 16  matt 16 hits  laura i like how every time you roll it comes out  sam it does this is very bouncy okay so 1d6 thats a four plus four is eight plus i get  sneak attack damage cause im a rogue another four so thats 12 is the creature bigger than  me i 
none	 will use fury of the small  cheering  sam to inflict another two points of damage so thats 14 points of damage  matt okay as you pull around the corner and release your one crossbow bolt it hits the bottom  of the chin and pokes out one of the eyes the eye goes flying off into the distance as the bolt is  now jammed outside of the socket the creature turns glancing your direction it looks pretty  hurt but its still standing  sam can i use the rest of my actionmovementwhatever bonus to look 
none	 at the  patron im next to do they have any baubles or jewelry on them  travis in this moment  matt ill say you can use your bonus action to just look theres nothing you can do this turn  but next turn you could so make a perception check  sam oh its just nine  matt nine its hard to look you see this what looks to be late30s woman dressed in some sort of  general workers clothing with a loose apron and shes just running and scrambling to get towards  the exit you 
none	 dont see anything of worth on her unfortunately sorry all right nott that ends  your turn molly youre up  taliesin im still engaged with it right okay im going to take two swipes  matt okay so you spin around you pull your second scimitar out as part of the strike one of  them encased in ice crystals so the first strike make sure you mark which ones which  taliesin purples the ice thats the purple is 12 to hit  matt 12 just barely hits  taliesin ooh so they both hit so thats good 
none	 so thats going to be or all three then because  the other one is 21 to hit  matt that hits yeah  taliesin the first one is four points of damage  matt four points of damage  taliesin im sorry the magic one is six points plus three ice so nine points  matt nine points of damage all right  taliesin the other one is four points of damage  matt okay so the first strike hits and as the scimitar carves through the body snaps and opens  and it snaps back into place the 
none	 torso locking back in the second strike does how much damage  taliesin four points of damage  matt yeah the second one hits again and you watch as the torso spins off it looks like only the  spinal column is holding it in place but its managing to maintain its structure as it snarls  that ends your turn  taliesin someone anyone yep  matt all right ending mollymauks turn that brings us to beau  laura beau you got this  marisha in response to him i say i thought you said you didnt let in 
none	 the sick  taliesin just kill it  marisha i come up and i want to do a flying superman impact  matt wham go for it  marisha first one okay 16  matt thatll hit damage  marisha i had my staff oh i had my staff but i said  liam you said superman punch man  marisha its fine its fine six damage  matt six points of damage natural 20 you watch as you sock it in the face and the jaw breaks and  then snaps back into place as you land pulling it 
none	 back you can see some of the teeth are  actually stuck in your fist as you pull back theyve broken off into your knuckles  marisha i go oh come on im going to use my other ki point to do flurry of blows again and  im going to try and punch him in the bridge with the remainder of his teeth  matt her teeth technically this is the woman that was killed originally  marisha oh ill be like you were so pretty too  matt go for it two more strikes  marisha 19 and 
none	 18 natural and then okay  laura thats a really pretty dice  marisha eight 12 13 damage  matt natural one no so the second punch you swing wide and hit the side of the head and the neck  snaps and its now stuck in a sideways position as it turns the jaw it pulls back one of its  weirdly swollen clawed hands ready to go for that open wound in your gut and as it does  how do you want to do this  cheering  travis first one  sam first blood  marisha 
none	 ill do the uppercut with the other one and the one that has its teeth in it i want to go  right between the bridge of the nose and get the teeth right in the eyes and break the nose bridge  into the brain you know that thing yeah  matt and as you do that you slam into its face you watch as the skull caves in the teeth  piercing both of the red bulging eyes and with this horrible sucking sighing sound it falls  onto its back no longer moving the shadows released  
town	 marisha i grab my gash and fuckedup ribs and immediately turn over me can i do a perception  check or an insight check on any of the ringleaders on any of what was going on the  ringleader or the jester  matt that was your turn unfortunately thats your turn at this point the current threats are  down and the crowd is screaming and rushing the two members of the crowns guard are rushed to the  front weapons ready and they see both of these creatures bloodied and ruined across the base of  this in 
town	 the midst of the chaos one of them points and goes you you stay where you are  and you watch as the rest of the crowd slowly pushes through you see as gustav  manages to make his way in dear god whats happened here looks over toward bo the breaker  the halforc whos now joined the rest of you sir i dont know how he got in here and  everyone looks around back at you bo looks at you gustav looks to you molly what happened  taliesin one of them turned i dont know what

none	 im going to drop my sword  laura oh thats better for you ten for you  matt okay at this point the two crowns guard that are there are trying desperately to maintain  control you can see theyre visibly shaken and they glance at each other like theyre a little  out of their depths at the moment stay where you are dont go anywhere  taliesin oh wherever will i go  matt and he turns to the one whos in the front looks to the other one who just made his way  through and goes 
town	 sivelmen find someone bring the rest of the guard please right now sir  and he pushes his way towards the back as the rest of the crowd runs out now everyone in the crowd  has mostly pushed out of the tent the last few dregs pushing through children crying people of  trostenwald just exiting out the flaps as they close and youre all standing there weapons in  your hands wondering what to do  travis what are the corpses doing now that theyve fallen  matt theyre both unmoving ruined torn apart  laura can i 
none	 search the corpse of the woman  matt you can as you go to move to it both of your forms merge the crowns guard goes like  dont move  laura which one  matt both uh he looks genuinely confused  laura when im going which one i make my second form just dart forward and start searching  the body  matt okay it mimics searching a body its not actually you begins rifling imaginary things out  of the pockets  laura look at all the stuff that that ones finding over there  laughter  
none	 laura can he turn and look and i try to search the other guy  matt make a deception check to try and deceive him to glance over  laura not bad 19  matt laughs he goes what over there looks over as you jump over quickly and begin searching  through it and you guys watch her do this and theres a clear line of sight as soon as he turns  back hes going to notice her rifling through the other corpse  ashley is gustav still in here  matt gustav is now walking up and 
none	 hes hands up in the air im terribly sorry i this has  never happened i dont know what happened what happened  taliesin weve never seen anything like it before he just he gripped his heart and fell  over and turned into that thing  ashley it was when toya started singing  marisha yeah whats with the dwarven girl why  taliesin nothing like this  matt shes been singing with us for over two years now  marisha howd she come to you shes a pretty young girl  matt she had no family and she 
town	 was singing in the street for change there was an opportunity  we seized it we gave her a family she didnt have  travis put your hands down  matt the crowns guard goes like grunts its fine just dont move  laura did i find anything  matt make an investigation check  sam she uses a different dice for everything travis  laura shut up  sam is that what im dealing with now  travis youre not even ready  laura 14  matt you manage to rifle through the old mans body through the stringy 
none	 bits of gore and you do  find three pieces of silver that are just coated in blood a few moments pass the rest of the  people are gone and its just this awkward quiet and at this point you watch as ornna the fire  fairy who had previously performed walks in and is like im sorry what has happened here  laura your little dwarf girl was singing and she turns people into zombies  taliesin i feel that that was entirely coincidental im really not sure that the two  things were related something was wrong 
none	 with this man  marisha see its interesting because i would say the opposite i would say it wasnt that  coincidental because  liam i would agree it seemed to happen with this  taliesin weve seen her sing dozens hundreds of times nothing like this has ever happened ive  seen people sit in the front row hundreds of times nothing like this has ever happened  liam have you had the elderly or the sick in these tents before  marisha yeah you also happen to be very explicit on your page that you dont want the 
none	 sick so  taliesin gustav  matt at this motion gustav goes its generally just because we want to promote a space of  welcoming cleanliness when were working amongst the outskirts of the empire we dont want to  bring an element that reminds you of death and  sam you hate old people so much  matt well were in entertainment we have to be cautious the single crowns guard guy whos  sitting there with his weapon out you can see him shaking almost hes never had to deal with  anyting like this before  taliesin 
none	 hold up ive never seen that one before he looks really suspicious  matt towards him  taliesin no the guy behind him  laura gasps he does look suspicious  matt make a deception check  taliesin sure eight  matt he goes dont try that on me ive been doing this for over ten years  ashley oh wait look at him  laura i cast thaumaturgy and make it sound like theres a sound coming from behind him too  matt make a sleightofhand check to see if you can cast this spell subtly enough or not 
none	  sam this poor guard ooh  groaning  laura natural one  matt as you attempt to cast this spell a little bit of spittle gets caught in your windpipe and  you begin to cough uncontrollably yeah it just falls away  laura coughing there was some popcorn that i ate earlier  travis you should know that whatever happened to that first man when he attacked the woman she  caught whatever he had  matt and that is extremely worrying nobody touch that body and he looks back and sees you  coughing over the corpse 
none	 and the guys like dont you touch that body are you sick  laura coughing i have bloody fingers  matt someone hold her down if shes sick and turns into one of these i will not  ashley shes fine just calm down  taliesin well weve already killed two of them  sam shes definitely sick  matt make a deception check  laura that was cocked unfortunately that was a good one oh well 16  matt 16 his face goes white and he goes kill the thing and rushes forward blade held above  ashley i

town	 voice i had a gut feeling that you were nothing but trouble when you came into our town gustav  turns around i guarantee to you my friend i have no idea what happened here the crowns  guard whos been shaken turns around and goes sir flynn there was a creature this carnival  seemed to create some sort of terrible entity that killed and then created a secondary beast i  watched it with my own eyes from the back row and the man turns back towards gustav and the rest  of you and who else saw

town	 members of the circus are hiding and as soon as you exit out  the front and they see you before the crowns guard they all immediately scatter and vanish to  the nearby shadows out of sight the two of you walk out into the center the fire crackling in a  small pit off to the side all right where is this girl you speak of  ashley shes in the back in the tents  matt show me  ashley follow me  matt he follows you which tent do you lead him to over here okay
