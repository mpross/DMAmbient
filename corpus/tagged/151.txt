none	 luck almost seemingly brought on by the mildly  antagonistic scoundrel shendo mccree has you nearing doing far dirtier work than you were used  to which thatd be quite dirty based on your past history  zac i seem to have forgotten what some of those things were could you elaborate a little bit how  dirty are we talking here  matt well things youve done in the past involved from what the public knows saving a  small village from a poisonous arcane sand golem and some artefact beneath on the outside and not  known so 
tavern	 well you burned half the village down you nearly threatened to kill the few survivors  that were there and took what little bit of gold remained in the pockets of those completely  distraught villagers  dan but we did save that woman from the house  matt you did you did youre right i take it back however currently ailing from the immediate  lack of funds you sit about the raucous alcoholmisted tavern known as verians beer den  drinking what remains from the inside of your coin purses and currently discussing amongst  yourselves how the 
none	 hell to pull yourselves out of this looming debt  dan how are we going to pull ourselves out of this looming debt  laughter  dan its just looming  zac well if you had done what i had asked you to do which is to communicate with these peasants  and possibly find us some good bounty work or at least something  dan no one wants to talk to a man with seven fingers no one  zac valid point how about will you tape on another finger maybe perchance  dan ah yeah thats not suspicious

tavern	 okay while salty pete is currently staring at the lowly stumps of what used to be his  digits on one hand the two of you notice on the far side of the bar a young girl maybe 16 or so  rushes into the tavern from the back with a hooded cloak covering most of her features she runs over  to the tavern owner behind the bar a rather robustlooking gentleman in his mid30s big  square chin gaston in appearance and a bit of swagger to how he runs this establishment this  being the verian character 
none	 she runs up to him and hands him a piece of parchment talking to him for  a bit you cant make out the actual speech and theyre too far to make out what the lips are  saying but she hands him the parchment and they speak for a bit verian then reaches down and  hands her a little bit of gold ulfgar you recognize the amount of gold passed over as you  are very tuned in to the presence of gold  laughter  matt five gold pieces have been passed on to this young girl 
none	 she immediately nods pulls her hood  up even closer and darts back out the door she entered from  marisha she was just getting a dime bag its fine  zac were you checking out an underage woman or was something else going on in that situation  ify no silly i was checking out that gold over there man i dont care about women just gold  zac what gold are you speaking of  ify theres some gold in that pouch that she gave to him now im about to go over there and im  going 
tavern	 to seduce him  zac carry on go for it  ify hey there i feel like two beefy dudes like me and you can really share some gold and some  good times together what do you think  matt as you approach verian at the bar and say this to him verian looks at you with a quizzical  expression and goes well i dont mean to tell you one way or the other but i am first off very  confused but mildly blushing at this offer youve given me but strangely enough you walk with

tavern	 hope its another 20  ify oh  dan hold on 13  laughter  matt as your hand slides across the front of the bar your finger touches the edge of the  parchment you wink and point with your most fingers in the direction and he glances briefly  and as you give a slight tug you feel his meaty hand slap onto your wrist and slowly pull  back your hand his glance comes back towards yours meeting your gaze and goes it is now 20  gold my friend  dan aww you got me there 
town	  ify i go ahead and take this opportunity to rest my hand on his hand and say we can work this out  my friend we got something here for both of us  laughter  chat room small street urchin boy runs by and steals paper  dan what  matt suddenly the paper is snatched out from verians hand the influence of the dark deity  somehow pushing fate along this child that shouldnt have even been in this tavern from the  getgo is just small enough to stay out of sight runs off going laughs

town	 the town square there i shall be  able to present to you perchance a way to make a bit of coin for yourself  dan you were right  zac you heard that i was reading in my head  dan what oh man our cycles must be lined up  zac basically we need to go to this building and theres a possible job for us  ify oh i like that job means money stephen rule number one always do something if its for money no  matter what  dan always  matt okay for the 
town	 money then as you guys continue towards the center of the town square  you eventually take a look about and you find the grey brick building on the corner indeed the  windows themselves a dim light from the inside the door is closed it looks to be a small  relatively unadorned or simple building more for function than visual presentation as you walk up  to the edge of the door the door appears to be closed and locked  zac its locked  dan ah thats where i come in ive got whats left of my 
none	 masterwork thieves tools id like to  unlock the door  matt okay  ify dont worry if it doesnt work we can always burn it down  matt roll add your dexterity bonus and your proficiency modifier  dan come on three fingers all right dexterity is plus three 18 plus modifier what is this again  matt plus two should be your proficiency modifier  dan there we go 20  matt with but a swift move of your wrist the door slowly creaks open and you can see the low  reddishorange light from the interior of 
none	 the room becomes visible immediately as you push the door  open and glance inside it is cluttered wall to wall small wooden crates and some broken glass  jars that contain dried weeds and other types of plant matter as you peek around the corner you  can see there are a number of shelves and tables set up before you that have strange long glass  contraptions with small brass wires that wind up along tubes liquids bubble and churn in all sorts  of different colors and textures the smell that hits you is this very aggressively 
none	 ironlike  viscous scent that causes your sinuses to immediately expand with this burning sensation  across the room you see hunched over a small iron table with big thick leather gloves on a  humanoid figure that is currently crouched in the middle of a very very intense some sort of a  situation such as working or tinkering  dan it looks like a hoarder  zac this could be a dicey situation i think this might be a good opportunity to maybe get your new  son some experience possibly go and greet this fine creature  
none	 ify im not going to send my new son to go im not sending my new son down the hall hes not  going down there now stephen stay with uncle pete im going to go down there  zac fair enough thats fine  matt ill stay with my uncle pete hi uncle pete  dan hello stephen  marisha oh god  ify ill go investigate that hole  matt okay as you open the door and step into the room you get a better view of the interior im  going to have you go ahead and 
none	 roll a stealth check  dan oh im the one whos good at stealth  laughter  ify three  dan whoops  matt as you step in and look around the rest of the door you see theres actually three other  individuals inside this room on the other side of the wall all patiently sitting armtoarm as you  step in you get about two or three steps before your elbow bumps one of the nearby tables as it  hits it a glass jar thats been on the edge topples and falls shattering on the ground  
none	 instinctively the gentleman whos hunched over at the other table goes whos there and throws  something in the air i need you to make a dexterity saving throw  laughter  dan this is not going well  ify seven  laughter  matt you take four points of acid damage as suddenly this vial thats spinning in the air  shatters on the ground before you filling your space with this horribly caustic liquid it fills  your lungs and pocks the outside of your skin and youre coughing it burns the inside he goes  oh im 
none	 sorry im sorry you spooked me wait what are you doing here  ify you just throw acid at anybody who walks in your house come on man  matt that door was locked for a reason intruder intruder  dan this isnt our hotel room oh my goodness what whats going on with you get out of our room  zac see stephanie this is why you send the dumb ones in first  matt um steph  dan hes not supposed to talk to you youre sending him mixed signals  ify dont listen to this crazy dude

none	 room if you guys would like to describe yourselves  zac hello  dan describe yourselves  laughter  orion my names quaalude methaqualone pleased to meet you wood elf druid do things  dan quaalude methaqualone wood elf druid you do things  orion nice to meet you hi this is my associate  liam my name is kurt i come from the northern hills barbarian folk i dont wear much i dont  have much patience dont test it  ify yeah i see it im liking what im seeing right there liking that outfit baby yeah

none	 take this  liam the fuck are you  yelling  ify hey come on thats creepy  zac i somehow feel like all of these things are being driven by some unseen force this is the  proof i was telling you about the shathrum exists  dan i remain thoroughly agnostic all i see is a stapler  zac of all the things that have happened  dan id love to take this creation this  ify wait so youre not going to throw acid at her she came out of nowhere you dont throw  acid at 
none	 her im the only one  dan presumably she was already in here  zac lets calm down and figure lets  matt at this point the poof of cloud smoke slowly disappears as the guild leader has extended the  stapler looks over towards the alchemist who invited you and goes oh thats josephine ive  known her for quite some time dont worry she thats how she gets in and out of the room its a  bit spooky a stapler thats curious have you tinkered this item yourself and she extends it  and goes no i

none	 well anyway ive called you here for a reason but  marisha who are you the chat room  orion what the hells that  yelling  zac stop stop stop you know of the shathrum  marisha im sorry once again hard of hearing sonny boy  dan this is awfully convenient  marisha the chateau yes ive been to the chateau  liam hes asking you where the shitter is  marisha the shitter the shitter is right around the corner  zac no the shat the shathrum the shathrum speaks to me does it speak to you 
dung	 too  marisha oh you know that voice are you referring to that voice  zac yes yes the voice  marisha i heard that too did you hear that is that what were talking about now i dont know  matt im certainly afraid no ones heard no shathrum thats a dark god we dont speak of  dark days in the past it rendered whole communities forfeit of their lives i really hope  that youre not saying thats what youre looking for  dan no definitely not  zac definitely i would definitely not follow every word 
none	 and commandment of the shath no  matt all right well down to business then  marisha okay oh wait let me can i detect magic on that stapler  matt do you have an identify or a detect magic spell  marisha i do have detect magic  matt okay you take a moment and it is indeed emanating a magical force on it  marisha can i tell what kind of magical force  matt you gather it has some semblance of an abjurationbased spell enchantment youd have to  actually take some time with it to ascertain 
none	 its nature  marisha you know i have to take a little bit more time with it but i feel like it might have  some sort of protective qualities to it  matt anyway youve all stumbled loudly into my home  ify yeah but i also got acid thrown in my face dont forget that  matt you snuck up on me  ify im never going to let you forget that  orion weve been here quietly  matt i know and thats fine i have two mercenary parties that are now vying for the same  
none	 job  dan shotgun blitz no blitz  zac we dont even know what this is what we dont agree to a job before knowing what the  job  dan fine please disregard  ify i agree to money and it smells like theres some money in here and it smells like theres  some acid in my face because you poured acid in my face  matt perhaps itll be worth it when you hear what the business is about all right now it  appears ive lost my assistant i would like to find him checking in 
none	 on his wellbeing is what i  ask of you discover where he is and bring him back safely if possible its been well weve  been working on some sort of planar shifting through alchemy and forgotten lore for a while  now and we found a nearby arcane nexus in the east toward the center of the zorla swamp  theres a nasty horde of goblins that live out there but we managed to barely sneak past them at  the time and we set up a portal anchor at a place underground now our first attempt already 
none	 proved  successful we managed to open a doorway to some unknown location im not stupid im not going in  there so i sent my assistant in with a rope tied around his side off he went he stepped  through  zac i like it i like it thats a good tactic  matt i think so too protects my wellbeing and what goods an assistant if theyre not  disposable right  zac i completely understand  matt so i sent him in he stepped through didnt return for about 30 minutes nearly  bringing all 300 
none	 feet of rope in with him  dan thats a lot of rope  matt i know it went taut i pulled him back in and eventually he came back safe and sound little  chilled a little confused but fine came back sneaking past the goblins a little bit of a run  as they discovered our passage but we made it back fine that evening he recalled a landscape  of shifting shapes and earth purples and darkness and forms without form and creatures that drifted  between the realms all kinds of interesting things one swam through 
none	 the air and through him  leaving him tickled and unscathed but thats all he recalls he says he only recalls about five  minutes of this portal then darkness for a bit but he was in there for a good 30 minutes i think  he lost some time in there anyway pulled him back he was fine but he grew a little more  distant over the next few nights not really answering my calls as quickly seemed to be lost  in thought a lot and eventually in the morning he went missing i used my divinations 
none	 as limited  as they are to discover that he had run off into the swamp by himself beelining for that doorway  that we originally found and opened so i count myself lucky on a blue moon and i wish not to  endanger myself by going after him myself thus im willing to pay 2500 gold pieces to the group  who finds him and brings him back  dan like i said shotgun  ify im going to need to take a seat real quick thats a lot of money oh yeah tell me how much  
none	 that was again  matt 2500 gold pieces  ify oh yeah  zac i apologize hes  dan hes an enthusiastic  ify say that one more time for me its just getting me there  matt im going to not actually theres children present  dan he likes currency  liam are you asking us to work together or to compete against one another  matt to be honest i would prefer you work together because i get the feeling this isnt  going to go very far if you dont  zac im completely okay with this 
dung	 as long as you all understand that i am of course in lead of this  party  liam laughs  orion as he says that im going to take a special leaf pod that i have and im going to pop  a couple seeds  dan was that an edamame  laughter  orion you want one its great  zac no no  dan just curious  marisha is that metamucil is that what that is  dan keeps him regular  marisha ah yes i forgot to take mine today  orion jumbled itll make you 
none	 poop  marisha what  liam were going to get your shit done for you where are we going  matt east to the zorla swamp past the goblin hordes youll find some sort of a mound with a  tunnel in it beneath there is where we found where the planes are weakest and where alchemy  allowed us to open that doorway hes probably somewhere within there scattered he does not  have the means of opening the portal himself this i know hes probably somewhere lost in that den  dont know why try and bring him 
tavern	 back safe if you could  ify do we want to rest before this maybe stop by the valarian bar for a little bit  chat room edna suddenly develops tourettes and cant stop saying vilian and dasmodel at random  intervals  marisha did they say edna  dan they surely did  marisha edna says what randomly now  dan she has tourettes and says  marisha i have tourettes and i say what  matt balium and deswomwom  dan balium and desmond  marisha balium and desmond  matt what was the phrase  marisha if

none	 front of the illusion it casts it into dust as the wave passes over as it rushes just about to  strike you with that the thunderwave passes and the entity is destroyed and is no more  dan holy crap  matt so as you all stand there clutching your glowing shaking stapler that slowly fades to its  mundanelooking self the immediate danger seems to have passed  marisha does that stapler still appear to be magical  matt you go over and take it and as the vibration is slowly  orion you all right edna

none	 like this entire group has fallen into a nexus period in which the  magical energies uncontrollably alter the landscape around thus the events that have  transpired in the recent time  marisha this explains why its been a very weird day  dan theres got to be a rational explanation  matt as you make your way toward this earthy mound you look about the outside and you can see  there are a series of animal limbs and strange crudely carved runes and various skulls that are  all hanging by pieces of twine all around the 
none	 outside of this entranceway that seems to delve  into a deep animalistically carved natural tunnel into the swamp floor proper  orion i want to do an insight check  matt onto  orion to see if i recognize any of the carvings or any of that stuff  matt it wouldnt be insight per se insights more of a persons motives you can go ahead and  roll a religion check  orion okay thats 14  matt okay  ify can i roll a perception check  matt what are you looking for  ify my vagina

dung	 root in salty pete you can see the  confidence of a modernday woman taking over what was once a relatively questioning male leads the  charge deeper into the swamp earth before you the tunnel dark and moldy from the interior the cold  air hitting you you can smell mildew and rot and what sounds like wood that has largely fallen into  dusty awfulness descending further into the cavern you hear in the distance low muttering  this small synchronized cacophonous chant this whispered incantations echoing maybe youd  imagine 20 30 feet ahead of you around 
none	 a bend you can see a little bit of flickering light  thats pushing into the hallway from around that turn  orion when i hear that im going to use my mask of the wild and im going to blend into the side  of the rock  matt okay as you shimmer to the side of the rock go ahead and roll a stealth roll with advantage  orion yeah thatll work thats a 19  matt 19 okay you crest around the edge you enter an actual chamber at the end of this  hallway closed off 
none	 and theres a couple of small rocks in the center but in the middle of this  you see a large bonfire an orangishblue flame is flickering and burning you can see stones  arranged almost like a haphazard halffallen doorway you can see what appears to be four  goblins around one of which is larger than the others with all this war paint across its face  and theyre all chanting in unison chanting  marisha i go ahead and cast mage armor on myself  matt all right you have mage armor on yourself you can see 
none	 though the lead goblin is throwing  things into the flame with each toss the flames flicker up into vibrant blue flames and then die  back down the color turning more and more from a blue to a bright vibrant yellow its pulsing  now the fires pulsing  dan id like to stealth  matt roll stealth salty petunia  dan all right that is a 30  matt okay  dan im level ten  matt all right so as you come around the bend too you see the druid which is currently hidden  across the 
none	 rock you also have the same view and you can see the danger at this suddenly as  youre watching you see the flames flicker in and the goblins all stand up and a tendril spikes  out of the flames this small purple door seems to open up and a tentacle reaches out and wraps  around a goblin and pulls it in it screams all the goblins keep chanting keep chanting it opens  up even further and further and from what you can see now this entity starts pulling through its  this weird fleshy mass almost 
none	 like this amorphous giant cluster of flesh that is  surrounded with teeth and eyes eyes that glance around in all positions mouths that open up and  screech and squeal and then disappear its constantly moving and shifting in its position  and as it comes out this weird twisting cacophony of voices of all different shrieking  sounds and low guttural murmurs all happening at once eldritch noises the goblins smile and  look more and more feverish as suddenly it reaches out and grabs another one stuffing it into its  maw until eventually only the lead 
none	 goblin remains as he stands there chanting and chanting  and chanting the creature moves forward and slowly envelops and rolls over the goblin you  hear this scream as its body is completely consumed as it pulls back you can see almost the  goblins face appear as part of its fleshy mass for a second and then vanish into it you also see  a partially absorbed human arm and half of a face that matches the description of the assistant  cyril that you were coming to find  dan its ulfgars vagina we found it  
none	 ify real funny guys you guys are real funny  zac i take my imp off my shoulder and i say lucas stand five feet in front of me and then i  use crown of madness and i attach it to the merchant my son and make him also stand five  feet in front of me creating a human shield well not human but a shield a body shield what  children are for theyre ready to soak up that damage  dan how big is this entity again how gigantic  matt there it is  dan
