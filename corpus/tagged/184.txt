as we all prepare ourselves  to begin to kick off  tonights episode of critical role  spooky ethereal music  heavy breathing  roaring  dramatic music  gun firing  dramatic music  crackling flames  matt welcome back  so picking up  where we last left off last week  vox machina the growing troop of heroic misfits  having recently felled  their first recent member of the chroma conclave  umbrasyl the hope devourer  as well as destroying  the current incursion of the herd of /town/ storms  in the city of westruun  you met with  the remaining people of the town  and began to decide a plan  for its continued existence  and the recovery of those that were displaced  in these recent conflicts  part of this process was meeting an individual named kerrek  who was a blacksmith who had been in the town for a while  who unwittingly  became part of this discussion  marisha my best friend  matt laughs  grog had spoken with  the remnants of the herd of storms  /none/ that had essentially  been disbanding from the name  and moving west  to join with the rivermaw  which had stepped off  from the herd not too long ago  you guys had a hot springs episode  in the mansion  sam laughs  matt scanlan  you had made your way back to kymal  in which you along with the aid  of a few of your friends  figured out a plan in which the people  who had been displaced  could eventually return to westruun  and also found kaylie  /none/ and spoke with her  had your somewhattearful  reunion there  you guys began to construct a subterranean portion of westruun  that would be protected from future dragon incursion  renovating and restructuring  within the sewer system  beneath the city  after this process was complete  you decided the next level  of your trek  the next direction you would travel  would be towards the far western northwestern continent of othanzia  specifically the city of vasselheim that you all know so well  all of you guys stepping through a tree portal /none/ presented by keyleth  you immediately step out  into the snowy exterior  of what seems like the outside of the quad roads in vasselheim  and now we see what  your next plan of action is  what do you guys want to do  sam sighs light a fire  laura what time is it laughs  marisha yeah what time is it  matt its hard to tell right now with the cloud cover so thick in the sky  but you envision at this point in time  its probably midafternoon or so  /none/ the general omniscient glow  through the clouds  kind of diffused light  but based on the time that you  where you were  and how far you traveled  you gather its probably  early to midafternoon  sam well youre the one  who brought us here vax  where would you like to go  liam i need to go  to the temple of the raven queen  sam well come with you laura lets go  taliesin i know where that is  liam i know that you all  have a lot /none/ of errands to do  i dont need everyone to come  travis we have a lot of errands to do  liam i thought so you mentioned  laura my only errand  is to keep my eyes on you  taliesin i have some errands if that makes anybody feel better  i have some errands to run  travis do you need any help with your errands  taliesin sure actually yes i would love some help with my errands  laura dont let him shop percy do not let him shop  taliesin that shouldnt be /none/ a problem  travis i dont know what that means but im sure i take great offense  laura laughs  taliesin youre getting smarter  travis how effin dare you  laura that eagle form  really made a difference  travis i spit out a feather  pthh  matt so whos off to where  laura where is this  raven queens temple  liam sighs  weve not been here many times  are we surrounded by people  are there people walking about  matt it is quite a busy time  in the afternoon /none/  there is actually a bit  of hustle and bustle  looking around  just a quick glance  at your vicinity in vasselheim  you can see a lot of the bastions  are out in force  many of them are in process  of helping construct  what looks like  reinforced dragonheaded ballistae  some of the ones you had seen towards the outside walls of the city  there are more being installed upon the inner walls  and the ones in the distance  appear to be under some form of construction  /none/ taliesin we have rooms  why dont we go claim our rooms  and im sure they can lead us to everywhere we need to go  liam that makes sense  marisha want to go check in at the slayers take  taliesin and we can meet back there when everything is done  marisha all right  laura do you need  to check in at your temple  or should we pretend  youre not here  so they dont try  to make you stay  ashley lets just pretend  for a little bit  /none/ travis yeah marisha okay  ashley and then ill check in later  theres no rush to get there  at least that i know of right now  sam god will wait  for a long time  travis all right  to the slayers take then  laura lets do it  taliesin to the slayers take  matt all right you guys continue  further south into the quad roads  until eventually you find yourselves at the slayers take guildhall  the door is partially ajar already  it appears that somebody  had left it /none/ open  but it is warm on the inside  you can see a fireplace hearth  on the far back and to the right  is already kind of filling the area  with this subtle musty smoke smell  and the crackling of wood  in the distance  is a very welcoming sensation  from the cold exterior  of the city streets  as you enter  you do not see anybody at the front desk at the moment  but you do see a few other random individuals of the guild  that have taken /none/ certain tables  some are eating  and some are in the process  of playing cards or passing the time  it seems to be  a relatively casual day  here at the slayers take  but your rooms are still available best as you need  anything you specifically require  in this place  laura can i grab one of the people  that are here and ask him  whats all  the hustle about outside  i see them installing more  matt okay you go ahead and  one of the guys closest /none/ to you  youve met him briefly in passing his name is loran  he has a completely bald head  with a single stripe tattoo  down the center  he has a very very pointed long chin  human but hes probably been busted in the face a few times  you can see theres just scars  and what appears to be bone structure  that may have been reformed at times due to blunt trauma  but hes just sitting there sharpening his weapons  just kind of doing good upon his own self being prepared /town/ for anything  but as you come over  to ask him the question  he looks up to you and goes  words gone  around the town recently  that theres some wandering  dragon horde  tearing through taldorei  so theyre just upping security  around these places just in case  laura smart  matt i hope so  hope they make their way here  laura nobodys sighted the dragons  though over here  matt not to my knowledge but  chuckles id love to get my hand  on some of them /none/ scales  blade scrapes  marisha whats your name  matt loran  marisha and sam what  marisha oran what  matt loran  marisha loran  matt because thats what i remember  liam thought so  laughter  liam it took over 50 episodes  for that to happen  laura im sorry  what was the question  matt well when you dont take notes  when i give you  a characters name originally  and they come back around  and its weird  when you suddenly take damage and your character starts hemorrhaging /none/  laura oh no loran loran was his name  liam i was just eating an apple why am i dying  matt laughs  travis veiled threat  ashley im just sitting by the fire so  laura slayers take  marisha so we have seen  this guy before  matt some of you  may have seen him in passing  you havent really  had a conversation with him  he just exists within the guild  theres many members that youve come across in the past  marisha sure that exist travis probably a dragon /town/  laura pointy chin got it  ashley stripe on his head  travis nothing wrong with those  liam how are the people doing  is there a sense of worry or do you guys feel pretty secure  matt as far as this town is concerned  it takes a lot more than a couple dragons to drop these walls  its the reason its been around  for a long time  and id like to see them try  marisha have you ever encountered a dragon personally loran  matt i mean ive come across a /none/ few small ilk in my days  marisha uhhuh sure yeah yep  sam laughs are you hazing loran  marisha nope  laura keyleth is proud of herself  because weve just killed our third actually  matt oh thats fantastic  i love to hear it  you halfelves are a humble bunch  laughter  travis fire put the flames out  marisha yeah team halfelf yeah  travis such a good burn  laura liam i dont want  to ask matt this  but the chick  that runs the slayers take  her names /none/ vanessa  all vanessa  sam cyndrian  liam and her husband merkin  sam mertin  matt laughs  laura are vanessa  and merkin around  sam mertin  laura mertin  sam merkin is a different thing  matt laughs yeah  a very different thing  i guess it depends on  if he shaved recently  he looks toward the back room where her main office is and he goes  youre welcome to go ahead and knock on the door  if youre feeling frisky  laura should we try to sell vanessa some /none/ of our dragon bits  travis we should sell to a merchant  laura well they tend to be in the  taliesin they may have a buyer  laura and marisha yeah  travis love that you  asked me that question  laura i know right what was i thinking  travis i dont know laughs  taliesin keep a few of the scales obviously  travis we can tell  what my place in the party is  laura of course grog come with me  marisha oh wait keep the teeth keep enough teeth for us /none/  taliesin well talk  about the cold bag for now  and see if theres anything else they want to talk about  marisha i have an idea for teeth  laura can i go find vanessa  matt you go  and knock on the door knocks  theres a brief pause  knock again knocks  laura singsong vanessa vox machina here oh hi  matt the door whoosh swings open you have to duck backwards  it thump slams onto the other side of the wall there  knocking a few knickknacks that were on a /none/ nearby shelf over  and vanessa swings out  what whos calling ah it has been some time  how nice of you to come and visit  may i be of service to you  laura oh well we were wondering if we could be of service to you  we happen to have acquired a great many dragon bits  and we thought you might be in need of  buying them for your sellers buyers  your people  sam fencing them  laura fence you know  taliesin i really thought  youd be better at /none/ this  matt there is no fencing  laura no fencing no no youre  matt we run a legitimate business  laura legal buyers  matt good  as was i hoping to hear this  let me check my ledger  she turns around  and goes back to her desk  her tail flicks behind her as she steps  over to her table leans over  muttering ah  pulls one of the books blows starts thumbing through it  mutters what color dragon  laura black  matt chromatic  sam quietly ancient  laura /none/ ancient black dragon  marisha yeah you might have heard  about him umbrasyl chuckles  sam youre super salty today  travis tone it down two notches  matt there is currently no contract for a black dragon  i do have one up for a bronze  or perhaps a white but  laura oh white  do we have any white bits left  travis yeah  ashley we should have white  from back in the day  laura what do you want scales or  matt specifically hide if there is white dragonhide  travis /none/ we have 60 pounds of  laura that was the dragon we killed for you before  because we didnt bring the  taliesin no it was before that one  laura no but we killed one with zahra we killed a white dragon  matt that was  for a different contract  this is for a newer one i came by  laura weve killed four dragons four fucking dragons go us  marisha yes we have yes  travis excuse us  while we reminisce apparently  matt deadpan yes it is amazing  the things youve /none/ accomplished i am blown away  but in light of your capabilities  i do not require anything black dragon  however if a contract comes in i know who to call  hold onto that because that would save you a trip  laura and marisha all right  taliesin we do have some white scales left over dont we  laura yes i think so  travis yeah we do we have 60 pounds of scales  matt is this hide or scales  travis just scales  no hide unfortunately  matt well i could definitely do /none/  a bit of business for you there  the hide would fetch more but 60 pounds you said  travis yeah 64 to be exact  laura of white dragon scales matt 64 of white dragon scales okay  matt i would be willing to continue at least part of this contract  for this applicant for lets say 4500 gold pieces  laura 5000 gold pieces  i think is a fair price  matt this is not about bartering  this is what the contract says my dear  this is beyond  a situation of conversation /none/  the paperwork is already signed  laura what if we gave you  less dragon scales  would you have said less money  sam thats typically how it works  taliesin and marisha laugh  matt vexahlia my dear  my delightful little  dragonhating halfelf  weve been good to you  weve done many great things for you youve done great things for us  this is a fantastic arrangement  thud she slams the book shut  and sets it down  but you have signed on with us  and the deal is to /none/ fulfill contracts  as they are signed as they are written  as they are agreed upon by the person  if you wish not to accept this contract  we can just wait  until somebody else picks it up  and goes out and fulfills this need  at the price  at which they are requesting for this  youre welcome to keep the scales  laura i think well keep them  and well sell them to other vendors then  sam havent we had them for years  taliesin i have a thing  im /none/ thinking about  matt see then its easy  for you to get rid of them  if theyve been a problem for you then im sure this would be easy  sam where are we going to sell these the worlds on fire  marisha okay hang on  we know its here  there arent that many white dragons walking around  taliesin certainly not anymore  marisha certainly not anymore we know its here  why dont we sleep on it  think about it  if were ever in a pinch for money we can come /none/ back  travis yeah sounds good  laura vanessa youre so kind  travis besides ive been working on that dragon immunity potion  laura im so sorry  matt that is all right goodbye  and she shoos you out  marisha oh wait vanessa wait  matt yes other female halfelf  marisha thats me wheres the temple of the raven queen  matt oh youre looking for  the duskmeadow ravens crest  she points loosely outward  kind of southeast of the direction of the slayers take guildhall  its kind of hard to miss its /none/ giant black ominous  chuckles youll see it  and she bops your nose a little bit with her finger  now please out of my office i have work to get done  laura thank you vanessa marisha okay bye  sam thank you  kords strength to you  matt that does nothing for me  slamming slams the door shut  laura they were worth a lot more  than what she was offering  just for the record  they are worth so much more  sam to whom  we havent ever sold them  /none/ or come across anyone  who wanted them before  taliesin this is no reason to get rid of something for wholesale  laura well weve not really tried  that doesnt mean  we should just give them away  sam we also are almost full  in our bag of holding  might i remind you  and 64 pounds would free up quite some  laura its not 64 pounds  sam its 64 pounds travis its 64  laura oh it was 64 pounds groans matt laughs  travis like i just told you ashley 64 /none/ pounds of scales  travis but i could  get rid of some other stuff  laura well theyre worth  like 20000 gold  sam to whom  laura you dont care  travis we also have 15 cases of expensiveass bottles of wine  taliesin im just going  to point out since  liam laura and marisha  we should drink those  taliesin we should drink those  first of all  that is the only thing that makes sense  and i feel and i apologize if it seems like i say this a lot /none/  but i do have a castle that we can drop things at  and we can leave them there perhaps get back to them at a later date  marisha to be fair percy  you do a lot to remind us  to try not to forget that youre titled  sam to be fair have we ever  gone back for something before ever  in our entire travels  taliesin yes sam what  liam we neednt stay here long  i dont think what im here for is going to take too long  i /none/ hope we could go to whitestone next  taliesin yes drop everything off  create a little nest of what we need  laura all

basilisk eggs  laura are they still good marisha those are probably bad  taliesin oh i bet those have gone really bad  travis i reach into the bag of /none/ holding and think about one basilisk egg  liam im sure they smell like grog  matt you pull out a basilisk egg  taliesin do they just turn to stone  matt its roughly that size its a dull grayishblue hint  liam sulfuric travis can i get the smell  matt it has a somewhat very vague  sulfurous scent on the outside of the egg  travis ill put it back in the bag  ashley oh vanessa  laura we could make stinkbombs with it  marisha and taliesin ooh liam yeah we could  marisha /none/ good idea i like that  travis all right so whats next  laura we go see the raven queen  you go see the raven queen and we wait outside  liam i didnt say anything

taliesin okay  matt youre heading  to the braving grounds  theyre heading to the duskmeadow  travis oh i like the /none/ sound of that  ill go with you  taliesin yes you will  sam ill come with you as well  travis yeah three who else  any other takers while vax goes and gets a tattoo  matt laughs  liam another tattoo  travis well i thought that is that not what youre doing  laura thats what hes

taliesin this is out of  i dont know if this is going to be any help or anything  by the way vax but just in case  im going to reach in  and pull out the mask  and hand it to vax  just in case  liam slowly i dont know  thank you  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha do you still have  that ravens skull i gave you  taliesin i do well talk about that marisha all right  taliesin but ive found in moments  when /none/ i was feeling less than brave  that pretending to be somebody else on occasion  even afterwards can be helpful  liam is there anything left  inside of this  taliesin just some spit  liam thats wonderful laura laughs  taliesin and something that smells nice  in the front that will help  it helps cleanse the air  liam all right percival  taliesin i dont know why  im feeling what would be the word  superstitious  marisha oh i was  going to say giving  laura shes ornery today marisha sorry /none/ angry  taliesin you know  i kind of like it  liam you know enough chitchat lets get this shit done  matt and travis all right  matt so you three  are going to the braving grounds  you four are going to the duskmeadow  laura we are  matt okay all right so  you three are making your way towards the braving grounds  following suit after percival  you make your way up not quite to the trial forge  which is where you had  your last discussion  and brief showdown /dung/  with earthbreaker groon  still seeing the large statue of kord  looming over the entirety of the realm  you can still see the large columns of dark smoke and soot  coming out of the various forges the various mining encampments  and a lot of the folks there  that are working on different pieces  of iron and metal  you i assume make your way to a very familiar abode laughs  taliesin of all the options of the world that youve given me  matt all right  laughter  taliesin this is /dung/ really your fault  as much as its mine  matt you come up to the outside  of a familiar hovel  previously damaged missing part of its roof  the roof is mostly repaired  you actually see two individuals  are over the top of it  hammering pieces of wood into it  not a very fine job  but definitely enough patchwork  to keep the rain and snow  from pouring in  the door is partially open  as you approach  taliesin sighs heavily  sam you might be blown up  /none/ if you go in there  taliesin i know

and the area before it and the actual frame of the door itself  no traps  taliesin all right  matt glancing inside though you can see a little bit of light  it looks like theres a hooded lantern across the way  and just a little bit of light is flickering  and its kind of  going against the wall nearest to you  to your right as you enter  the /none/ same familiar smell of fresh earth  really really really dry dust  and a very familiar smell of explosive black powder material  taliesin oh dear  sam is victor in there  taliesin no i dont see anybody in here  sam well should we just  purchase what you need via the honor system  and leave some coin behind  taliesin hes not necessarily always a believer in coin  sometimes he just wants some trade  also i need to talk to him  about some personal issues  matt thud you see off to /none/ the side  what you didnt initially notice  as you entered  what appears to be a wooden trapdoor in the far corner that thud  taliesin oh sweet gods of pelor  matt repeated thuds  and you notice  that apparently something  a large sack  of some heavy material  has rolled off a nearby table  and is now currently  holding the door down  taliesin okay  matt you hear a muffled im inside  taliesin im going to go  try and lift it  taliesin grunts  matt you lift /dung/ it up  set it off to the side boosh  coughing whats going on you

questions  just about other customers again  matt thats a lot taliesin i know  matt i have powder  taliesin you do  matt i can sell you more powder question one yes how much  taliesin one question

shouting how /dung/ much  taliesin well i was going to offer  i was originally going to offer  some gold if you like  but if youd like i could make you a tool  you could use  with your current

hat shop  is there a hat shop around here  matt considering noise  and he starts pulling around from a pile of oiled rags and shit  /none/ and he pulls up what looks like a small burlap sack  thats torn somewhat at the opening  hat  sam oh god ugh all right thank you thank you  matt my pleasure  happy to help chuckles  sam okay  taliesin that was everything i could have hoped for and more  matt dont get near the fire  taliesin really dont sam thank you  taliesin has dr ripley has a woman come by to buy black powder  one hand one mechanical hand  one normal hand mechanical hand  matt is that the /none/ one youre saying you can make  taliesin im going  to make you something  nice and useful claw piece yes  matt so youre saying  that this woman  made a better hand  than you can make  taliesin no i can make  a better hand  matt then make me a better hand why would you give me a lesser hand  taliesin youre going to need to give me quite a bit of black powder for that  and more questions  travis ooh matt really  laughter  matt ive had a /none/ bad day  taliesin is that recent sam that happened today  taliesin it doesnt look that recent  matt ripping sounds  he starts unwrapping the wound  taliesin oh thats recent thats wet thats very wet  matt its pretty recent  taliesin i can work with that i can work with that  im going to go construct you something  that will be perfect for your needs i have a great idea  i will need another hogshead and a half  of black powder  and a little information about another customer  and then /none/ i will leave you  to your work is that fair  matt fair  he turns around rushes over and grabs the same phantom hogshead  that he has lying around his place  taliesin he eats a lot of pork  matt before he fills it with powder he goes over to scanlan and goes  hums too big  travis good hat  matt fills it with black powder carefully brings it over  holding it under his arm  grunts  taliesin thank you grunts  i will put this  in something reasonable  ill /none/ be back  in just a little bit with  actually do you have a glove that you used to wear  or anything like that  do you have something  matt yes  he pulls out the glove  that was on the hand  laughing and you can see that its blown apart  hand burned to cinders  taliesin i can  take measurements from that  matt its more a sleeve  with a charcoaled edge  taliesin im going to be busy  can you cast the  sam no but keyleth can  /none/ and i think that would save you  a lot of time  marisha im not here taliesin shes not here  sam no but we can go get her  and come back  taliesin to sam to just fix his hand  taliesin i dont think  she can just fix his hand  sam someone can restore something maybe pike can  marisha i can  not today but i can over time  travis want me to give it a try  taliesin while im tempted  would you just  i feel like i made /none/ a deal  im just going to have to see to it  sam i think he would prefer a real hand than a claw hand  taliesin would you prefer  a real hand or a claw hand  matt depends  how cool is the claw hand  travis and sam laugh  taliesin thats what i thought  sam i would much rather  you spend time  on projects for us  than projects for him  taliesin this is projects for us  travis i vote for the claw  its pretty cool  taliesin /none/ and believe me i would like  matt cooler than that ladys hand  taliesin keeping him happy is pertinent  i can make this myself  its just very difficult  sam we have party members who can regrow his hand  travis hey percy taliesin yes  travis he wants the claw to be cooler  than that ladys claw hand  taliesin thats very easy to do she has no aesthetics whatsoever  travis all right  then eff the old original hand  lets give him  a reasonable claw yeah  taliesin

taliesin so im going to go  see if theres  if theres not a blacksmithing  if theres not somewhere i can do  a bit of basic smithing work  and technical work  then im going to go  find /none/ that blacksmith from last time  matt theres basic materials to do  essentially weapon repairs  armor repairs  minor armor construction within the slayers take  if you want something  thats going to be  a little more to the level  of what youre doing  you may have to actually  rent out a facility  taliesin well im going to go find that young chap from before  matt okay yeah easy enough to do  if you want to rent the forge  for the day  to craft whatever it is  /none/ youre looking to craft  hes charging you  50 gold for the day  taliesin 50 gold for the day  can i use all of his tools and just my own materials  matt you have to supply  your own material but hell let you rent  taliesin im going to run and find vax get my stuff and go to work  matt okay you guys  you four make your way over towards the duskmeadow  laura trinkets out  matt trinkets out whoosh  bear moans  laura come on trinket  matt grunts /town/  he rolls his head against you licks the side of your face  happy to be out  of that stuffy little necklace  you make your way towards the duskmeadow which youve seen before  its a very comparatively  glumlooking area of the town  hence the name that accompanies it  but this is the area  of the city that contains  the ravens crest the amaranthine oubliette  it also contains  the entire towns catacombs  this is where  since this towns existence  all of the dead are interred  perpetually /none/ deeper and deeper and deeper beneath this part of the city  also one of the oldest libraries of the city  is kept here as well  as you approach the outskirts and you can see a very fine line  between this area and the birth heart  which is the melora section of the city  there is a very very wide river divide between the two of them  and its like night and day  back and back  very very very directly  between the two of them  you can see on meloras /none/ side theres just stalks and stalks of corn  and other vegetation  thats being grown for food  theres almost like a lush forest that curls around the outside of it  that doesnt match  the rest of the indigenous trees  youve seen in this area of othanzia  the entire birth heart area where this temple to melora is  is just this  pluckedoutofnowhere section  placed into it  and then you move over to the duskmeadow  and its just like the color  has left the vicinity  and there you see /town/ in the center of this part of the town  this large looming ominous obsidian and gold structure  its like a giant black stone aerie  it has no intricacies  from this distance that you can see  its almost like a giant square building that is just devoid of light  with little glimmers of gold when the light catches it at moments  its hard to miss  and definitely stands as a centerpiece  to this section of vasselheim  liam the whole walk over  ive been talking a lot mostly to trinket  /none/ you know scratching him  behind the ears saying  buddy youve been  trapped in there a while  its good to see you out  matt moans snuffles  liam come hug your uncle come laura he doesnt mind it  liam im sure he doesnt im just happy to see him  matt he presses his nose  under yours  and lifts your chin up and you bite your lip a little  from the sudden impact  from this very large bear  but its all with love  liam yeah its cold youre sure /none/  you dont want to go back in  nah you dont want to go back in  i know  marisha whispering hey pike  liam just nervous talking  the whole way there  marisha whispering  i think vax is talking to himself  ashley whispering  hes very nervous right now  ashley this is a big deal marisha yeah  ashley this temple is very its lovely  marisha its gorgeous  its very intimidating  do you know anything about this youve lived here for a while pike  ashley ive never been by /town/  marisha never been in ashley ive never been in no  matt you do know from your time here and what little youve heard  that part of the purpose  of this vicinity  is not just to inter the dead within part of these catacombs  the library here  is kind of a loose partnership  between the people worshipers of her and those who follow ioun  it is a center for knowledge and history kept within the city  but youll see throughout the town and the landscaped outer wall  that surrounds this /none/ entire portion  of vasselheim  there are repetitive glyphs that line this entire area  and from what youve heard at the very least most of these glyphs  which you see  across the corners of roadways  and many of which surround the entrance to the catacombs  it is a perpetual enchantment that is  to seal any sort of possible undeath  there once was  a terrible scourge of undeath  in this part of the landscape  long ago  that corresponded with a battle  hundreds of years ago  and since /none/ then the reinforcement  has been put in place  to prevent that  from happening again  so the downside is  that the power of these glyphs  that prevent undeath  also prevent any actual vegetation from existing in this area as well  so all the ground  that youve come across  no grass no natural vegetation  its just dirt and ash and dust  marisha can we recognize the language in which the runes come from  matt the magic itself  is divine in nature  but its based in the same /none/ very very base draconic glyphs  that a lot of arcane magic  is based on  its very its old magic  ashley laughs its old  matt yeah its based  in some sort of divine ritual  marisha what did you say  the name was  of the raven queens temple again  matt the temple itself  is referred to as ravens crest  marisha ravens crest  matt ravens crest yes  marisha okay  ashley how are you feeling vax  liam im all right  im just going to talk  to /none/ my sister for a minute  ashley okay  liam you know  i know you want to  i know you i know you want to be here  laura i know you dont  want me to come  liam i dont  i really dont  laura i know  and i wont if youre sure  i put you in this place  and i feel terrible about it  and i know youre extremely nervous  trinket can sense it too hes very in tune with those emotions  and i just  liam listen /none/ to me  you did not  put me in this place  no one put me in this place  liam and everythings going to be fine laura everything will be fine  liam and i tug her sleeves and make them a little more orderly  and i move a bit of hair out of her face and i do a button thats not done  laura laughs  liam everythings going to be fine laura i wanted it unbuttoned actually  liam thats all right just wait here ill be out in a bit all right  /none/ laura yes liam everythings fine  laura i know everythings fine liam yeah  laura you dont need  to be nervous either  liam im not  laura i will be here waiting for you when you come out  liam i know ill see you  laura i love you  liam you know i love you too  laura im proud of you you know  shes just going to love you so much  and who knows  you might have a new girlfriend  when you come out  laughs nervously sighs  ive heard /none/ other people  have dated gods before  ive heard its done that cashew guy anyway  liam youre going  to wait here for me right  laura ill be right here  liam and then i drop the smile  as i walk off towards the other two  matt okay  which as you turn and look  when you originally approached  the stairs that lead up to the entrance  of this large structure  it was just empty doors closed  there was no guard post  on the outside  it was just /dung/ these two looming almost dark glasstype doors  about 12 feet tall and about 8 feet wide on each side  that are just locked shut  as soon as you turn  to walk towards them  the doors open and you see a figure  standing there at the door  just looking directly at you  or at least you assume  is looking right at you  its hard to see  this individual  somewhat lithe in physicality  is wearing long dark robes  and their face is shrouded in opaque black cloth  /none/ like a death shroud that just blocks the entire face  you can see  the hint of a jawline a nose  it looks to be a person of some background in there  but theyre just standing there watching you  and as soon as you react  to their appearance  the hand just beckons quietly  liam were you expecting me  all right  ive brought a couple of friends is that permissible here  theyll keep quiet  marisha i turn to vex  laura keep him safe  marisha i swear to you /none/  were all coming out of here alive  laura i know  marisha but if like an hour passes  and we dont  maybe come in  but were all  coming out of here alive  so dont worry about it  its fine  ashley and i squeeze her hand  ill make sure  he gets out okay i promise  laura all right ashley okay please be safe  laura itll be fine ashley itll be fine yes  laura ill just be right here waiting here with trinket  ashley okay  laura /none/ just calmly leaning  against a wall no big deal  ashley okay  marisha weve faced  way more terrifying things  than a few albeit creepy  men in robes  laura i dont even think shes that bad  shes not going to be bad  liam guys laura just go  ashley okay well go  well go in with you  matt all right  as you step up to the stairs the figure leads you all inside  and as you step into the main center of this initial walkway chamber  the figure /dung/ doesnt enter with you  it just closes the door behind you  echoing thud  you can feel the hint of vibration of impact  as the doors close shut  marisha its dark  matt its lowlylit on the inside and its interesting  from the outside it looks like  a black solid impossibletoseethrough building  from the inside  you can actually look out  and the entire building  is made of this glass this somewhatwarped dark glass  and you can see almost the entirety of the outside  from your position  the /dung/ doors are held aloft into it  its like a oneway  type enchantment  or the construct the material itself is somewhat translucent from this side  marisha like an interrogation room like oneway mirror type of thing  matt kind of or like a very very dark pair of sunglasses  but made of naturallyformed rock almost  liam noticing that i turn  and just sort of look at my sister for 5 or 10 more seconds  matt she doesnt see you and she just stands there quietly  looking around  inspecting the vicinity  /none/ pets trinket a little  liam hesitantly lets do this  sam chuckles  ashley do i feel anything  being in here  matt you just feel  a natural tremble  stepping into a place  of powerful divine influence  that is not  the warm comfort of sarenrae  which has protected you before  now you understand the way many deities work in these lands  and your place in it and sarenraes place in it  and you know enough  about the raven queen  to know that this is not  an /none/ unwelcome place per se  go ahead and roll a religion check  ashley 23  matt 23  you understand the raven queen  has also not always been  the one who holds sway  over the domain of death the domain of winter  the domain of fate  once mortal the raven queen ascended  as essentially a follower and a partner  to the previous god of death  which his name has been erased from the books  this mortal ascended many many years ago presecond spark  and has since taken what was /none/ once  a tyrannical position of death and afterlife and souls  and took it instead as the natural transition that it is  however  due to a lack of respect  or at least a lack of  for lack of a better term  belief or trust from the other gods  she only gained dominion over the actual moment of transition  not of the actual souls  of the afterlife  that influence was given to others  but the raven queen represents  one of the most feared elements of life  which is /none/ the end of it  but you also know  that that is a natural thing  your personal belief is up to you  the sense you get here is that  being an individual  that worships life  that worships redemption that worships second chances  you cant help but swallow a little hard  at the idea of a god thats purpose is to make sure  that if youre destined  to have once chance  it stays one chance  ashley okay  matt as you begin  to walk down this hall  /dung/ ever so slow as it is  each footfall deafening  in the clack  clicking footsteps  the hallway leads on for another hundred feet or so  before the glass somewhat translucent material  shifts into the next chamber  into an almost  deep gray and ivory icelike interior  the dark coalblack exterior youve seen  now transitions into what feels like  a very finelycarved  piece of architecture  from ice and bone  marisha do i get the sense as a druid as an ashari  that weve switched into another plane  /none/ matt go ahead and roll an arcana check  as this is not so much a naturebased thing yeah  marisha oh i rolled a 19  laughs 21  liam oh dear oh my laura oh gosh oh jeez  marisha oh goodness gracious  matt from your understanding  of transitional magic between planes  there has been no actual shift between planes  its just the material itself  is different upon the interior of this building  as soon as you enter this place  you do see another figure walking towards you  similar long /dung/ dark robes  however the veil  has been pulled back  and you see before you  what looks to be  an older elven woman with very  very bright silver hair  that just kind of falls long past her shoulders  down to her back about midwaist or down to the bottom of her waist  with a smile  you can see as she walks towards you a very welcoming grin  as she approaches she pays very little mind to you three  but directly to you says  laura whispers im not there /none/  matt you walk with her sight on you  you are ever welcome here  liam ive come  to understand my place in her sight  matt then i think perhaps  you are here for communion  come our most sacred chamber the communion pool awaits  only you may have entry unfortunately  liam right  liam i plant a kiss on the cheek  of each of the women  marisha do you need anything before you go in  any enhancement of any kind  liam just cross  your fingers for me okay /none/  marisha okay  i just kind of squeeze his hand  ashley same  be careful  marisha were right out here on the other side of this door  if anything terrible happens you have the earpiece  no one will stop pike and i from getting through there  if something terrible goes wrong  rules be damned  liam i made my bed now i gotta lie in it  ill see you soon  i follow  matt come champion  the lady of fates awaits  and she turns around and leads you 30 /dung/ more feet  to what looks to be an ascending staircase  that just enters up and out of the sight of you two  ashley well just hang out yeah  marisha i guess well wait yeah  matt you ascend a few feet behind her  about 40 or so feet  until it comes to a single large doorway  of deep deep dark oak wood  with what looks to be a dark iron ring in the center  as she steps up to it she takes it  and thud knocks on it twice  /none/ deep creak it just shifts open and leads into a central chamber now  that looks about a hundred feet high  and it is a large steepled dome  of what looks to be nothing but stained glass  its aweinspiring  its beautiful the colors the light as it peeks through  the source of light diffused as it is by the clouds  is sourceless in here  it seems like there are beams of light coming from all directions  and all the colors are just strewn across the floor  in what looks like this /dung/ perpetuallyshifting kaleidoscope  of dots of reds and blues and purples and yellows and pinks and whites  you can see across the room there are three other figures  that are all dressed in the same dark robes  the veils over their heads of varying size  you cant make out what their racial background is per se  but they are all stationed around the center of the room  in which lies from what you can see  a very very large round pool of some sort of deep crimson liquid  liam i have come /none/ to pay a debt  and i do so gladly and without question  what would you have of me  matt you came to speak with the lady  well the way is before you  she gestures to the pool  liam i walk slow and straight in  matt you step into it squelch  it comes up to your ankles to your knees  and what catches you first is that the liquid is very thick  it is viscous in a familiar way  this is most definitively a pool of blood  and it /none/ is cold it is icecold  as you step in you can feel that as it begins to seep into your boots  and begins to find its way into the crevices of your outfit  as you get down into your waist its just chilling  you cant help but to stand up straight as you step further in  not quite sure of how deep it gets  and it gets deeper and deeper  up past your chest up past your shoulders  and youre not even halfway into the center of the pool  before its /none/ going past your nose  liam i keep going  matt you take your last breath hold it  and submerge yourself in the pool  darkness around you the cold sensation  nothing  nothing  nothing  liam i open my mouth and inhale  matt as you do  you feel the blood fill your lungs  and immediately your lungs begin to seize with the lack of oxygen  you instinctually begin to reach up for the water and pull  but you cant rise  you cant get up  and at that point the /none/ cold piercing pain of the liquid in your lungs  becomes warm  all the liquid around you becomes warm  and in the darkness where you cannot see  you calm as suddenly your breathing is no longer difficult  its natural its like air  and its reminiscent of being in the womb  of the moment of birth youd forgotten so long ago  that youre just surrounded in darkness and comfort  and piercing the center of this darkness before you  you see a very faint bead of white light  just begin to spark /dung/ and grow and grow  and as that light widens out it becomes a face  a porcelain face  a nose lips a chin empty dark sockets  long dark hair that goes to crimson and surrounds you  you see a small hand reach up behind  and lift you from your legs  and for what you thought was only a few feet of liquid  you look around you and it is an endless space  a space youve been before  a space that you once visited in your sleep in your dreams  you /none/ look down below and you can see  the infinite skein of threads that you were once given inspection to  as you look down you see the very palm of the raven queen  holding you aloft in this space  as the mask pulls in close to you with a smile  the lips dont move  but you hear a voice from all directions in your head  a comforting voice a welcoming voice  my champion  vaxildan youve come to me at last  liam this was always supposed to happen wasnt it  matt /none/ there is destiny  but you still guide your path where it must go  especially you fatetouched  youre one of the few  that bends threads near and around you  thats why youre  so interesting to me  liam haltingly i give myself willingly to you  for the bargain that was struck  although i question if the bargain  was just the surface reason for this to happen  matt when one such as your  unique essence walks these realms  do not think i am the only one to take interest  /dung/ and do not think you are the only one either  but i was there to seize the opportunity when it arose  and as such you are now mine  and i know that you hate me i know that you fear me  most do  but only because they are without understanding  without death life has no meaning  finality drives change  innovation  greatness  it is the end that i bring  that drives all of your gracious creations of this land  to make the world better than we did than those /none/ before me did  liam i would learn your ways  i will learn your purpose  and i will serve  matt then understand the wholeness of what it is you serve  and what you represent champion  even after death the soul is carried to another purpose  but it is that transition where it is at its most vulnerable  it is my charge my gift your gift now  to safeguard that beautiful moment  there are those that find the immortal soul  one of the most pure and powerful means  of energy /none/ of sourced power in this world  that is an abomination  there are those that wish to halt the process  and live eternally in some form of undeath or the other  that is an abomination  there is also a difference  between bending your thread  around destiny fatetouched  and perverting the thread entirely  for death is sacred  but not all deaths are destined in that moment  some destinies require one to endure beyond the moment  to meet that moment many times before the final death is to come  we /none/ must guide these moments across this web  and as she sweeps her hand out  where she holds you in one palm another hand reaches out  and the entire web of threads just glows below you  in this curling wave out into infinity into the horizons  endless to each side of you and beyond  so to bend destiny  to bend these fates  is within our sphere of influence  its those that find a way to cheat this destiny  halt the progression  corrupt their thread to the point it sickens those /none/ around them  undeath wayward necromancy  perversion of the sanctity of the cycle  of our very domain is an atrocity  and must be stopped  and stamped out  that is our cause  your cause now  do you still accept this gift  liam whispering i do  matt you vaxildan ive had my eye on you for some time  and the smile curls into this much wider smile  to the point it seems  somewhat perturbing  your dual nature rushing prematurely towards your end  wantonly throwing your life before the /none/ flames  only to pull away in those last moments  instinct  you test your path constantly without knowing  youve been preparing  for this mantle your entire life  my beautiful champion  the smile subsides  the face goes stone lack of expression blank  the hand pulls back and you now can see  the full immensity of her size  her body infinitely long  looking down  before it disappears  into darkness  and as you look up  suddenly the mask is there before you  but normal humansized  youre /none/ no longer in her hand  youre standing on a floor  a floor of the same white icebone type substance  that the interior of ravens crest seems to be built from  and for a brief moment you see before you  the woman before the god the ascended mortal  no larger than you  from the hair that topples down the sides  the hand reaches up and grabs the mask and pulls it away  beneath the mask you see  a very beautiful  very sadlooking woman  but her eyes  are cold /none/ and red in the iris  her skin flawless and smooth white pale sunless  her brows thinned and furrowed  she steps forward and touches the side of your face  there are those who will be frightened of you  but know what we do  is one of the most important gifts  of all  and she grabs your head  pulls you down  and kisses you on the forehead  at which point suddenly your lungs  fill once again with searing white pain  you find yourself scrambling about  instinctually spilling out /none/ liquid all around you  and you finally coughs come out  on top of the communion pool  your eyes open and you can see  just red crimson pouring in your vision  you rub it out and youre in the chamber alone  eyes wide swimming around  you can see the figures on the side come to the edges  they all bow  the figure that led you in  stands at the mouth of this pool where you entered  shes smiling she has her hand extended  liam i take it  matt /dung/ she lifts you out of the pool  one of the other figures runs up  and takes one of the dark robes that they have  and pulls it off around them  revealing just a simple dark blue and black outfit beneath  still wearing the veil but wraps the dark robe around you  as the liquid is now back to its freezing cold sensation  your teeth are chattering  they lead you back to the door you entered  down the stairs and into the central chamber  where both keyleth and pike await  /dung/ you guys turn and see descending the stairs  being flanked essentially  by two of the members of the ravens crest  both of the shoulders with the dark robe wrapped around  a very cold and somewhat freakedout looking vaxildan  who has smeared red across his face  his hair is thick with viscous crimson liquid  ashley i run over you okay  marisha i stand at the bottom of the stairs and i watch  liam hoarsely i got answers in there  but they led to more questions  what am i to do /none/ with those questions  matt the woman who had led you in there  smiles and says  that is the nature of death  we cant have all the answers my friend  it is the pursuit of those answers that drives us  do you trust her  liam i do  matt then perhaps youll find those answers one day  liam thank you  matt thank you  they pull the robe off  and they all head back up into the chamber  leaving you all there in the room alone  marisha i walk /none/ over  ashley whispering im just going to stay where he is  liam im shellshocked  marisha you look well  liam its going to be good  marisha what did she say to you did she speak to you at all  liam whispering yeah  marisha shocked laugh  liam do you speak  ashley yes liam to her  ashley sometimes  liam do you understand  ashley i dont think any of us can fully understand  i think if we did

here  marisha why  liam everything has led to it  you and i wouldnt be standing here if my sister hadnt stolen a broom  wheres the sense in that  what else is it  i teleported into the stomach of a dragon with a gnome  and i am still standing here  if it is not fate what is /dung/ it  marisha i dont know  as someone who is constantly questioning mine  i dont think im the right person to ask  but i do know one thing  and i grab his hands  you were amazing and talented and special  way before she found you  if anything we can call her a god  we can also call her a great opportunist  she didnt give you anything special  the vax that i see before me right now  is no different than the vax that i saw before me ten minutes /none/ ago  im not saying  that what you experienced wasnt real and true  i believe you wholeheartedly  liam this is real  this was meant to be  and i am on board  marisha is it what was meant to be or what you just really wanted  and it found you  liam disbelieving laughter  it is not what i wanted  thank you thank you  i need to see my sister  and i head off towards the exit  matt you guys make your way to the outside of ravens crest /none/  the doors open once again  the figure that let you in is waiting for you opens the door  as you see the doors open  laura i jump up immediately ive bitten off all my fingernails  matt laughs rushing down the stairs you see pike keyleth  and your brother  in a little better spirits than when he first entered  if a little damper and redder  laura is that blood is that blood all over you  did she hurt you  liam it was really weird  but its fine  i /none/ told you id be fine  and im fine  laura i get out a rag and i start wiping everything off  laughs youre alive though  liam laughs yeah doesnt make any sense does

little lick  laura laughs  liam later buddy later  liam i climb on top  laura arent you glad you got out of the pokeball for this  liam i give a quick look back /none/ at my friends  and then i take a nap on trinket  matt okay  laura so everythings good then hes good everythings fine  ashley i think so i mean its it was very different  but that doesnt mean its wrong  laura he talked to her marisha

smiling with a giant black eye  sam laughs  matt you walk inside and its /tavern/ like  a small localized bar not a tavern by any means  but it has like one small setup in there  for just general beer  and just loads and loads of hats  leathers cloth all kinds of silly circumstances  you see some nice fancy hats with big feather plumes  you see joking hats that have multiple colors  and what looks to be bells hanging from them  as you step into the room  you see two other random individuals that are looking around shopping  and at the far end  you /dung/ see coming through a big thing of curtains  what looks to be  a rather rotund woman in her late 40s or so  big curls in her dark brown hair  and maybe a little too much makeup on her face who goes  darlings what are you looking for  what can i get you are you looking for hats  sam oh man  matt i assume youre looking for hats  sam wow yeah weve come to the right place  travis the guys are missing out on this one  laughter  sam hi

moisture  matt nothing to block the muscles no not at all  but i have to say with a fine smooth head  it does need a little decoration if you dont mind me saying  travis oh you think so matt chuckles you  sam something in a yarmulke perhaps  matt i was thinking  /none/ and she whips out what looks like  this fancy engraved leather cap with two straps on the side  and just shoomf right over your head  it kind of folds everything in  the straps just go very long and dangle there  laura and ashley laugh marisha yes yes  matt she takes them and snaps them underneath  to where these two little danglies are dangling from under the chin  and it just has these really intricate flower patterns  punched into the leather all around  sam i love it grog i think you /none/ look great  travis stutters sam we dont have a mirror here  matt i think it speaks of the seasons  travis is it over my ears  marisha is it like one of those oldschool leather helmets  matt it looks almost like the old

 travis screams everyone else laughs  matt exactly  men /town/ will fear you walking down the road  travis no please more like  a bit more like war death battlefield  more aggressive this is a bit more like sheepherder  travis here you go matt well all right  matt death battle aggressive sam maybe something with spikes  matt spikes spikes let me see what i can do  marisha laura and ashley laugh  matt and she runs off down the way gets into a bag  and you start hearing things going tink thud something rolls over  ah shit  eventually she comes out /none/  this is less of a hat and more of a halfhelmet  but maybe itll do  and she pulls forth  what looks like this very wide metal brim  almost in a swish shape to a point in the front  travis laughing conquistadors helmet  matt yeah it kind of looks like a conquistadors helmet  but its only the front  so its almost like a rhinoceros horn  that sticks up to a point  marisha yes laura oh my god  matt and the rest buckles to the back of the head  /none/ so its a giant metallic groove for the front  travis ill take it i dont even care if it fits  liam and marisha laugh  matt oh thats what i like to hear  travis how much is it  matt this will be 50 gold laura gasps  travis is the point very sharp  matt try it yourself  travis and i reach up and i hit it with my finger  matt its all right it can be sharpened  its more for decor  its not meant to slice somebody in half  travis /none/ yeah it could be sharpened  matt well i mean what are you  intending to do with this hat titters  travis nothing just look sharp  groaning  matt i

travis write that in a notebook somewhere  taliesin well be cleaning that off the floor for ages  matt so after about /none/ five minutes or so  she grinds down with what materials she has  to a little more  it does mess with some of the polish on the very tip of the metal  but it does come to a more solid point  be careful with that  travis so is it one piece or is there a strap on the back  or it just goes foonk  matt it goes on and then straps tight  in the back to fit your head  travis beautiful  laura its basically like a unicorn matt kind of /none/  travis rhino  matt its like a big old rhino horn that curls upward to a point there  liam wow wow matt it looks a little ridiculous  marisha im so excited for the art  travis what do you think hold on what do you think  sam wow  i

get it finished up  and youre pretty proud of your work actually and you feel  the whistle youre still doing as you do the final bits  you realize is the song that scanlan sang for you  just looping in your head  it happened to push you through your work  and get your final piece completed  taliesin i also carved a little message inside  that will not matter unless it /dung/ actually becomes

laughs try me okay do you go and deliver it  taliesin i do go and deliver it  matt okay as the sun begins to set in vasselheim  you make your way back over to the braving grounds  which as you look across too as the night goes dark  the braving grounds itself has /town/ a whole different life to it  there are so many forges and smelters going that theres  most buildings have this bright orange glow  through the ceiling and these various openings  where fumes and smoke and exhaust are sent up  from the various production constructs and such  it has this very luminescent look in comparison to a lot of the city  its very interesting  it reminds you of the deep deep portions of kraghammer  where most of the actual fire and melted rock  was being smelted and gathered and heated  /none/ so you make your way to the hovel  the roof workers are no longer there and the door is closed  taliesin knocks victor ive got your hand  matt muffled im sleeping  taliesin do you want your hand  matt muffled you want me to sleep  taliesin i dont see why theyre mutually exclusive  marisha laughs  matt you hear scraping sound a bunch of different locks fiddling  series of clicks fwoosh  and the door opens and you see victor  cleanfaced for the first time youve really seen him before  and /none/ he has a nightcap  which sort of foomf in front of his face  with a little puffball at the end  hes like  i told you i was trying oh hey  hesitantly percival  taliesin yes thats quite good i love your hat  matt thank you its comfy to sleep in  taliesin it looks it matt did you bring my hand  taliesin i did i grabbed your hand and i will show you  it is very special  matt come in come in grunts  and opens the door  you see /none/ hes wearing this long nightgown  that is covered in patches and tears in it  most of it has been turned black through soot  but the cap is perfect perfect condition  taliesin i have a special set of pajamas myself so i understand  matt they are comfortable  as he walks in still bandaged on the arm  you can see theres  a small kettle of tea set by the small fireplace right there  its a tiny little table and a tiny little stool  that hes just kind of sitting on right there /dung/  and he goes and he reaches over for the kettle  groans  tries to pick up the cup and just pours the tea into it  taliesin alarmed stuttering  taliesin im going to stop and

flipping through cabinets and knocking pieces of glass out  ah found it  pulls out another little ceramic cup  and pours the tea in sets it down chink click  cackles  sam laughs  matt /none/ to new hands taliesin to new hands  sam thats a great toast  matt it is pungent it is bitter  matt it has been steeped way too long ashley gunpowder tea  matt but it definitely cleans out the sinuses  and there is a hint of gunpowder to the flavoring  you get the sense that pretty much everything in this room  is marinated in some way shape or form  to be flammable  taliesin hoarsely victor  laughter  matt it can put hair on your balls  taliesin ohhh probably  has a /none/ woman been by to buy black powder  coughs has a woman been by  matt not in uh weeks maybe  taliesin weeks  matt did you make

and im going to walk by the raven queen temple  and just peek inside  matt okay you make your way past the quad roads  at this point at night the whole clientele has shifted  most people coming here you hear laughter you hear music  the /town/ quad roads is the new orleans  of the town comparatively  its still nowhere near as rambunctious as many places youve been  but for what seems during the day  to be a rather dour and serious business type city  the quad roads is where the celebration of humanity hits  when the evening hours hit  so you come by  and theres some taverns that are open  you see to a certain extent  what even appears to be an adult entertainment district  laura laughs sarcastically  matt you make your way beyond /dung/  liam clears throat ringadingding  matt its the oldest profession  you make your way all the way to the outskirts of the duskmeadow  and there amongst the  just barely peeking through the cloudline starlight  the looming dark structure that is ravens crest  taliesin im just going to gently open the door  and peek inside and see if anybodys inside  matt okay you go ahead and push the door open creak  doesnt appear to be anybody there  taliesin i walk in just for a moment and take a look around  /dung/ matt okay you walk in clicking footsteps  at this dark hour looking around the obsidiantype walls  are translucent glass on the other side  though you can barely make out through the material  the details of the outside world  due to the lack of light across the cityscape  especially here in duskmeadow  in which the magical lantern light that illuminates the city streets  are relatively sparse on this side of vasselheim  you take a few more steps in clicking footsteps  footsteps echoing across the long thin dark material of the floors /none/  creak thud  laura gasps matt door closes behind you  travis quietly what would why would you do this  liam said the t rex  taliesin im going to gently look around  and slowly back up and see if i can see anyone  taliesin hello hello  matt echoing hello hello hello  taliesin what do i have to pay to fix this  matt echoing this this this this  taliesin i leave  matt thumpcrash you hear the sound  of some sort of low distant hit and a rumble  and you /none/ see a distant light appear in a chamber just beyond the walkway  just faint enough to illuminate  and give the presence of some sort of life or movement  about a hundred or so feet ahead of you  taliesin i walk briskly towards it  matt you enter the next chamber  where you see the interior of this structure  is ivorywhite bone and glass with a blue hint  very much resembling the interior  of a very naturally beautifullycarved ice cavern  there is a stairway that ascends  as well as other hallways /dung/ that lead out  from the central nerve center  of the lower floor of the main structure  as you walk into this central chamber  you see ever so faintly at the very top of the stairs  a pair of feet footsteps walk and disappear up the stairs  taliesin im going to  charge after them  matt okay you go running up the stairway thud thud  you get to the top and you can see at the very top of the stairs  a dark wooden door with a dark iron rim  and /dung/ what appears to be  a large hanger or handle or knocker bolted to it  and it thud just closes  as you come underneath the top of the archway and up the stairs  taliesin i knock  matt doosh once  taliesin three times  matt doosh doosh with each hit  you can hear the reverberation of the echo of the knock  through a much larger chamber beyond  as soon as you release the actual door knocker  the door thumpcrash creak  just creaks open ever so slightly into a very very dark /dung/ chamber  you can see very very little in here other than the basic outline  of what looks to be a little bit of floor  some sort of a smooth glassy surface  that refracts just a little bit of light  that makes it through what looks to be  some sort of brokenup glass dometype structure above you  you cant make out much beyond that its very dark in here  taliesin hello please sighs  something terrible has happened  i dont understand how these games work  i need help to fix something /none/  something terrible has happened  you obviously care little for this world  i start to back out  matt as you step out of the room you hear a whisper  come from beyond the chamber within the darkness it says  is it yourself you wish to fix or something more  taliesin i dont think i can be fixed  there is something broken in the world  matt then come let us talk  taliesin i dont understand how these things work  im so sorry  where do you wish me to go  /none/ matt have faith  taliesin disbelieving laugh  matt step in join me  taliesin sighs i strip  travis gasps  taliesin and put it aside  sam put it aside  taliesin put my clothes in the corner  sam oh youre gonna jump her eh  taliesin youre filthy and i go into the pool  matt all right  as you step into the chamber freezing cold as your toes  taliesin were cold people  matt your legs your whole body eventually finds itself  stepping into this thick freezing liquid  you hear the /none/ whisper in your ears  just as your head reaches the level of the blood  that says  come come to me with your questions  just as your head goes beneath the surface  taliesin sighs were doing this  matt youre underneath and in darkness  feeling around the thick material  kind of just swishing your fingers around  but amongst the liquid  you still hear the whisper again in your ear  come bring your questions  taliesin and i swim down until its uncomfortable  matt you swim downward and you touch the /none/ bottom of the pool  you reach a somewhat concave  smooth floor to the pool  taliesin im going to head to the surface  i dont know whats  matt you head to the surface  theres no surface it just keeps going  taliesin sighs i do not do well with this  matt you do not you begin to panic  taliesin yes i do  matt you begin to reach around  and try to swim up and find the surface  but it just keeps going  the liquids thick and its hard to /none/ pull through  and you cant open your eyes and you cant see anything  and the ironlike flavor  is starting to find its way to the inside of your mouth  as its seeping through your nose and your ears  you begin to panic even further as the cold is starting to take  and you feel your muscles beginning to shake and seize  from the onset of hypothermia  you begin to head to the bottom of the pool again  and this time you crack your head on the bottom  in the middle /none/ of your stupor and you reach up and scream in pain  as you do the blood fills your lungs and you begin to feel yourself drown  you begin to shake and convulse  as you begin to try to find a way to force it out of your body  and you cant  and at that moment  where all of a sudden you realize that this is it  this is the end  this is how the tale of percival comes to an end  the sensation goes warm again  and its like all /none/ that cold energy goes away  and youre now swimming in water then air  and the pain subsides and youre breathing normally  but you still stand in darkness and you hear these distant footsteps  clicking footsteps sourceless  no light just shadow  and you look around  over your shoulder  and then right behind you you see immediately  a white porcelain face  the head is just standing there amongst the shadow  taliesin takes deep breaths do you know what ive done  matt ive watched  taliesin i have questions  matt /none/ then ask them  taliesin first is can we stop it  can we stop whats been released  is there something i can do  matt many things are released in this world  many terrible many wonderful many things  ask the right questions  taliesin did it choose me because i was broken  or did it break me  matt the mask which has not shown any expression at this point  pulls back a little bit from you and almost seems to grow in size  its strange  the proportion seems to stay the /none/ same but suddenly your vision shifts  and you realize no  its farther away from you and is just suddenly immense  like your visual focus just changes  and your whole perspective suddenly causes you  to lose sense of scale and balance  the voice comes in this time louder  you were always broken percival  and you were preyed upon just as it preys upon others  and will continue to do so until finally destroyed  taliesin can it be fixed  matt perhaps  your deeds will guide your path to salvation or /none/ damnation  the choice is yours you skirt that line still  taliesin but the first deed is so  theres so much and i dont think any of them see it  i want it to die before anybody sees it  can you help  matt ive already helped percival  do not think the path that you and your allies walk  goes unseen  there are many of those in this world that represent the will of us  just as there are those who represent the will  of those that combat us and always /none/ have  there are a great many deeds ahead of you  its your choice to take them  just know should you not watch yourself  you may not find yourself on our side  taliesin i know  there is nowhere  i can look for healing  other than deeds  i like to fix things  matt all life is inherently  broken from the start percival  take solace in that  there is no perfection in life  otherwise what would be  the purpose of death  its to try to find ways /none/ to better yourself before the end  that gives us purpose  you are all broken but also understand  at this point her voice  gets very deep and very resonant  mortals can achieve great things  i did  and the mask pulls back into the shadows  and suddenly gasp cough  you begin coughing finding your way to the surface  pouring blood out of your mouth and coughing  and eventually you find your way over breathing heavily  to the side of the pool and grunt pull yourself onto the side  cough /dung/ cough the rest of it up  a little bit of moonlight peeks through and you can see  the beams refracting through the purples and reds and blues  and just hints of specks of light  that just shimmer across the surface  of this dark glasslike floor  taliesin im going to take my sword  and im going to very carefully scrape my body clean of the blood  as much as i can  and im going to take the back of my shirt  and clean my hair off as much as i can /none/  im going to take a vial of the blood in the pool  one tiny bit  matt you do so  taliesin im going to put my clothes back on  and im going to cast hex on myself for my walk home  and banish it before i come in the door  matt okay all righty  so as percival finally wanders in  is there anything else anyone wants to achieve  before the evenings done  sam id like to go to the raven queen  laughter  sam no  liam are we /none/ next morning  or were still evening at this point  matt were still evening  at the moment  if theres anything else you wish to achieve otherwise  laura ive been slowly heating water  and giving it to vax to put in his bath  matt you do manage  to draw a comfortable bath for your brother and wash him clean  laura i dont wash him  i just give him the fucking water  matt you aid him in washing  himself clean so you specify  liam thanks man  travis do we /town/ see percy when he comes in  matt its going to be late  taliesin im going to walk quiet and late  and go tinker on a little thing for a minute  until i pass out  matt okay you do notice percy enter  looks a little frazzled but doesnt seem to  laura do i see any of the blood passive perception  liam youre in  the tubby town though  matt make a perception check  i want you to make  a dexterity check  marisha and taliesin groan  liam sorry taliesin /none/  sam youve got him  liam rolled high laura 32  taliesin 32  oh my god what the i couldnt have rolled that  like that wouldve been  a natural 20  would have been  the only way around that  matt you see just faintly  behind one of his ears  and at the edge of his collar on his coat  just a bit of familiar crimson and a look of  a distant stare that is familiar  matt all right  do you all wish to rest for the evening  /none/ sam no i would like to take 12 hours to read my book  matt okay so the first 12 hours  are completed  but you do not sleep  sam no  liam its a pageturner  sam lots of centerfolds  laughter  travis dont be stingy share those with me  matt written by john cleese its a wonderful piece  laura i also spend a lot of time that night reading  but im reading the book about the raven queen  matt okay  laura pretty much have it memorized at this point  /none/ matt yeah fair enough all right  you guys all find yourself to rest except for scanlan  who takes a point of exhaustion  for going through the night without sleep  sam i dont know what that is but someone will tell me  travis youll find out  matt yeah basically it means any ability checks  any skill checks until you get a full nights rest  are at disadvantage yeah  all right as you find yourselves to rest most of you  the morning light comes  greeting you to a new day  /none/ and were going to go

not too cold  the clouds are actually a little more separate this morning  you get brief moments of blue  it looks like the weather is a little clearer  than youre used to seeing in this vicinity  but the day is yours what do you guys wish to do  liam what do we need to accomplish here in town  is there anything we need to finish  or do we want to pick our next destination  sam do they sell  potions and /town/ things here in town  sam no they dont taliesin no very specifically they dont  sam then lets get the hell out of here  theres nothing for us here  travis what about the feywild sam

travis not you you  sam me taliesin oh you have a hat  sam i thought we waited for /none/ the hat  matt yeah he picked up the hat  travis oh shit balls ass all right  sam theres the feywild  theres dropping stuff off at whitestone  theres marquet which something is there in marquet  laura is one of the vestiges there  sam i dont know everyone just keeps talking about it  travis really  sam wait werent we  going to go to  marisha one of the vestiges is in marquet  laura which one  marisha hang on cabals ruin which is a magicdevouring cloak  travis hold on hold /none/ on hold on are we alone in this room  matt you guys are right now having breakfast in the guildhall  theres maybe two other individuals in the room  one of them is drunkenly asleep and snoring  the other appears to be going about their business  travis im just saying  marisha whispering okay ill speak quietly  theres apparently a magicdevouring cloak  who is being worn by the  its in ankharel its being worn by  laura its a cloak that devours magic  marisha a merchant warrior with a missing eye  /none/ sam and theres one in the bottom of the sea somewhere  laura and theres a really beautiful  strong bow in the feywild  travis yeah lets go to the feywild we at least know that place  taliesin i say we drop everything we take a pit stop in whitestone  and head towards the feywild  marisha so technically  we dont even have to head towards the feywild  do you guys remember  how i kind of did that thing with grogs evil sword  and kind of banished it away for forever  travis /none/ are we bringing it back marisha no  laura yeah to the dread emperors marisha right  liam not a good idea grog  marisha no were not bringing it back  i can do that with the rest of us  laura you can banish us to the dread emperors island  marisha no its not like a banishment  i can plane shift us wherever we want to go  to an alternate plane  laura to the feywild  so we dont even have to find an entrance  marisha yeah we just hold hands and think /none/ about it really hard  travis no way  marisha yeah its druid magic its great  liam and you put us  in a safe spot  somewhere in there somehow  marisha i can take us  to where weve been before to where its familiar  liam have we been there before i dont know  marisha very briefly taliesin yes  laura is it somewhere that you have to have been  or can it be somewhere that we have been  marisha it is somewhere i am familiar with i believe  through means that /none/ i am familiar  laura syngorn is in the feywild  sam normally  liam no not normally  laura they transferred  the entire city there  liam i know but youre saying weve been there  but they just did that recently  sam grogs been to the feywild  matt you can specify a target  marisha in general terms matt in general terms  marisha such as city of brass on the elemental plane of fire  sam oh is that where were going  marisha no  sam oh sounds like fun taliesin it does /none/ actually  marisha if you guys want to go to the plane of fire  thats like a hike and a jump through a hole  taliesin ah  travis no no not the plane of fire just the feywild  marisha all right yeah i can get us there  sam to the feywild  how big is the feywild is it like a football field  marisha its very big laura its a whole other plane  sam well how do  do we know where were going in the feywild  marisha i imagine well figure it /none/ out once we get there  taliesin do i know anything about the feywild  matt you have no knowledge of the feywild  ashley would i know anything else marisha what about me  laura would we have learned  something about it in syngorn  matt you have a general idea of it somewhat  marisha team halfelf yeah  matt somewhat just through your learning  you never actually visited there  the feywild is a near plane  a plane that overlaps this prime material plane  its a version of the world you live in /none/ right now  that is shifted and changed  in a place where time distance is relative and shifts  nature grows rampant and in cases  is hard to really expect its direction  things and entities exist there  that prefer to trick and lose wanderers  its a very strange place where some believe  elves initially come from or craft from there at least  liam do the two of us know enough  that were you to jump from the same place here  would you necessarily end up in the same spot in the /none/ feywild  matt you have no idea  liam we dont know all right  matt you dont know anything about the transition to the feywild  you just know that certain doors open at certain times  especially with full moons in certain locations  the classic toadstool rings  areas where the moonlight in the realms  can be a little thinner and the barrier doors do open  and those are where creatures can transition out or through  you do know its a place of fey magic  its tricky its difficult to follow  sam /none/ terrible laura it sounds awful  matt very like oberon and titania weird interesting  marisha question matt yes  marisha hmm okay sam good question  marisha it says the wrath of the fey warden  is what were looking for the bow and that it now acts  as the heart of a cancerous tree corrupting the verdant land  is there something i can do maybe try and  travis hold on is our stream up are we offline right now  lucas muffled from offscreen im checking just wait  ashley hold please  lucas it /none/ says were still online hang on  liam loot crate check out loot crate sam no one can see it  laura no it says its offline  liam refresh it marisha it says offline  liam quit the program and go back in  travis the chat is saying its off  lucas no were still online laura okay  liam tell them to quit and relogin sam its back its back  lucas im not sure what happened  im not sure it even  dropped frames on my end  liam whoa we were in the feywild /none/ for a second there  ashley oh it was crazy matt you guys missed six episodes  exaggerated sounds of relief  matt everything turned out okay  laura yay and we got the warden thing liam dragons are dead  marisha guys im so glad we won dnd we beat it  laura yeah that was the best  taliesin roll the credits scroll  marisha can i maybe sense a sick tree  you know what lets go to whitestone  lets go to whitestone and drop some stuff off  laura you know because the more i /none/ think about it  i mean we almost just died many times  and the last time we tried to get a vestige  it almost killed us and maybe we just need  a little bit more preparation maybe  taliesin lets empty our bags lets prepare ourselves  there are certainly stories in the woods of whitestone  of strange happenings  so im sure theres probably some connection  to the feywild and well see what happens  laura make sure whitestone  is actually  preparing something underground just like westruun  taliesin well we have /none/ something  marisha yes they have something underground already  laura exactly but theres a spinning orb of death there  taliesin which to be fair  is probably going to keep a dragon away  liam but i also think  weve earned more than a single day of rest  taliesin yes  liam lets go to whitestone taliesin lets go to whitestone  marisha all right ashley wheres the sea  sam the ozmit sea ashley yeah  matt the ozmit sea is to the east of you eastsoutheast  and that is a wide gulf that /none/ separates  from your perspective looking at me  theres othanzia ozmit sea and theres taldorei right here  laura oh okay  liam sneezes  taliesin and marisha bless you laura bless you  marisha the water ashari live in the ozmit sea  laura are they like mermaids  marisha no i think theyve got an island  ashley its also the sea that i sailed  marisha really laura gasps  sam ohhh taliesin really  laura in your roving pirate days  ashley i know it well  marisha how familiar are you  with the /dung/ sea  ashley im pretty familiar with it  travis what if we go there  sam we could  laura wait could i see  the list of vestiges  sam the one in the bottom of the sea is called whisper right  laura whisper  marisha a blade forged from metal pulled from the far realm  it was the center of many dark rituals  sam it now lies at the bottom of the ozmit sea  sunken with the lost ship the shrew  laura singsong the shrew ashley deep voice the shrew  sam /none/ a storm three hundred years ago near an island of glass  anyone know about the island of glass  laura have you heard about an island of glass  marisha have i heard about an island of glass  have pike or i heard of an island of glass  matt ill have both of you guys make history checks  marisha all right  i rolled a natural 1  matt you barely know what glass is right now  marisha guys water isnt glass thats stupid  taliesin i would have a theory as to what it /none/ was  travis she rolled a 20  marisha you rolled a 20 oh go pike ashley not a natural 20 total  matt explain  taliesin should i roll to figure out that this is probably an active volcano  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin im down  liam come on man  taliesin no wow  sam onesies marisha team ones whoo  matt natural 1 taliesin natural 1  liam snitch  matt doesnt quite come to you but what it could be  the idea of a volcano possibly comes to mind but  /none/ taliesin im distracted  matt yeah  you have not been there you havent seen it  but some of your crewmates while you were traveling  aboard your ship for that five sixmonth period  a couple of them did mention something about on the sea  a miragelike island that glistens in the distance  but they said to avoid it said it was dangerous  sam did they say where it was  matt no sam damn it  ashley heard many tales of the shrew  laura yeah ashley yeah the ship lost at sea  /none/ matt you know of the shrew you definitely know of the shrew  ashley all sailors know of the shrew  marisha whats the story of the shrew sam come on sailor  ashley there was a storm three hundred years ago  laura near an island of glass ashley near an island of glass  marisha it was really bad  ashley and the shrew just didnt sail on  sam it was tamed ashley it was tamed  laura laughs i was waiting for it to  matt come around again yeah it was good  laura come /none/ around yep taliesin taming of the shrew fits yeah  ashley good tale but well get there one day  matt whats the plan  liam whitestone sam yes whitestone  travis can i make  one other suggestion  emon  go take thordak right now  sam good call travis yeah one taker  marisha you know what grog laura its a good plan grog  liam its cheeky  marisha we will put that in our back pocket  and we will think about it  liam that helmet is really something else  laura you could /none/ really do  something terrible to him with that thing  travis im just saying i think we have an edge now  laura i think youre probably right sam chuckle attaboy  liam thats technically true yes taliesin you do have a point  laura but lets make sure  that whitestone is safe  before we do such a thing  sam percy we are in a place that has an airship dock  taliesin that is true  sam we could go steal an airship  taliesin we could go steal an airship  laura we dont /none/ need an airship marisha we dont need an airship  laura we have an instant ability to transport anywhere  sam it would be so cool though  taliesin then we wouldnt have to go to whitestone  it would hold all of our things  laura and marisha  when we kill all the dragons  taliesin we could hold  all of our things on the airship  and i could have cannonades  laura that will be the first thing we do when thordak dies  is we jump on an airship  ashley party on the /none/ airship  marisha well buy it with all of the gold  that weve stolen from all the dragons  itll be great  taliesin we wont need the airship if the dragons are dead  laura all the fun has gone out of it travis what are we doing  laura were going to whitestone marisha were going to whitestone  marisha piercing spell noise  sam before we leave do you want  to sell these stupid white dragon scales  taliesin no sam all right lets go  liam lets go to whitestone  marisha repeats piercing /none/ spell noise  through a tree  matt all right as you guys walk  outside of the slayers take guildhall  you find the nearest tree which youve used before to traverse  as you all step through the portal percy and scanlan  look over their shoulder at the distant skyport  and see the one airship docked there and think one day  liam so handsome  sam someday it will be ours taliesin youll make a fine sailor  sam passenger liam swabby  matt you jump through and emerge out the other side  as /none/ you step out of the portal you find yourself  jumping out of the center of the sun tree  marisha can i do something sam nope  matt what do you want to do  marisha while im in the tree can i do something  travis like kill us all  no no no say they go first go go go go  and i kind of start teleporting through the tree  and while im in the sun tree i just want to be like  hey boo  laura laughs  marisha i missed you  /none/ have you heard of this whole cancerous tree situation  in the feywild  sam whispering youre talking to a tree  marisha shh no im in the middle of the tree  im in the tree  laura youre stuck in the tree  matt as you finish this thought you hear this sound emerge  vacuum sealing sound and realize its the sound  of the whole portal youve made closing behind you  because it only lasts for six seconds  and you should probably get the hell out of the tree  marisha aww i step /none/ out of the tree  ashley good try  matt as you step out a voice goes  hey boo sorrykiss noise  laughter  matt and it closes behind you  marisha ill talk to him later  matt you guys emerge  due to the time differences you land here in whitestone  looking at where the sun is in the sky its early afternoon  as opposed to the morning where you guys just stepped away from  there are people in the streets and you see a few  a little bit of life has returned /town/ to this town square  though still by comparison  there are folks now that are bringing in actual  healthy looks to be fruits from nearby trees  theres a little bit of trade going on  this is the first real chance youve had  to see a little bit of whitestone coming to life again  as you emerge from the tree a few individuals nearby  stop and look and smile and wave recognizing you as you approach  laura are there any leaves on the sun tree yet  matt actually no there are not /none/ there are no leaves on the sun tree  sam quietly because its winter  laura whatever  travis we should check with the border patrol  sam theres a border patrol  travis yeah laura a wolf  sam oh the wolf  travis whistles i whistle as loud as i can  matt okay sam whats his name  marisha i dont know let me find it  sam oh boy harold  laura i just want to go find zahra  and give her a hug and say hello and see how shes doing  while hes /none/ talking  matt you whistle as loud as you can for a little bit nothing  travis must be off doing something belches important  taliesin quite  matt you head off and asking around  you find zahra is actually up in castle whitestone right now  just poring through one of the studies of books  and is just currently reading and reading on her own  as you eventually ask around and find your way there  entering the room you see her  with a small set of spectacles at the end of her nose  /none/ she takes them off and  my darling vexahlia  and comes up and just gives you a big hug  and picks you up and sets you down  im so glad to see  youre all right  laura dear the dragon arrow  you gave me killed him  well i didnt kill him actually with it  but i did a lot of damage  matt you killed a dragon laura umbrasyl dead one down  matt i knew you would  laura wheres cashew  matt i dont know hes testy these days  im /town/ sure hes around  laura i know his name  is fucking kashaw  so hes not there  matt probably down in the city somewhere  hes helping where he can you know broody types  laura i do know broody types  matt yes you do  laura what are you reading  matt oh im just learning about the history of whitestone  and im very intrigued as to the actual properties  of this stone  the entire town is built on  theres a lot of really really interesting things  that can be done /none/ with the materials in these mountains  laura im sure you have ideas matt i do  laura i sit down next to her and ask just catching up  and see if theyve spotted any dragons  matt you guys continue your conversation catching up  letting her know how things happened and vice versa  you dont get any info that any dragons have come by  apparently there have been a few other arcane practitioners  that have been helping set up some sort of barrier to help  essentially dissuade attention towards the city  the /none/ idea of keeping this place as far off the map as possible  should any prying eyes find their way there  its in the process of being set up right now  laura zahra how long did it take you to make that arrow  matt a few weeks  laura if i were to give you some more money  do you think you could do it again  matt probably based on what sighs if im able to use  some of the resources here within the castle maybe  laura ill talk to percy but im /none/ sure if its for a good cause  matt all right perhaps i can  laura all right  ill come find you dear  matt wondrous  what else are you guys  trying to achieve here  liam i am trying to find shaun gilmore  laura thats his first name sam shaun gilmore  matt and marisha yeah taliesin yeah shaun  laura shaun  how did you know that  marisha he told us  matt he told you guys that a long time ago  laura i fucking know i remember matt

liam lets start asking around town for him  matt you start asking around  you come across a few folks you recognize  you find a few of the guards who helped you  with the initial reconstruction of this city and such  and asking around  one of the nearby guards takes his helmet off and is like /none/  first off i am so excited  that you guys are back im so glad youre all safe  i heard that you were off to do some dangerous things  liam you heard right  matt well great im glad that youve survived  looking for mr gilmore  hes actually down with the realmseer  theyre inspecting the ziggurat underneath the city  so you could head down there if you wanted to find him  liam thank you  im not terribly familiar with whitestone  could you point us in the right direction  matt /none/ its under the castle  liam the castle matt yes  liam cant miss that  sam yeah weve been there before yeah lets go  liam lets go  matt he puts his helmet back on  thank you again  for all that you do  he clicks his heels together and continues walking through the city  liam all right yeah  sam i guess well head down to the ziggurat  liam lets do it  matt everyone else going with  travis fuck yeah lets go ashley yeah yeah  laura we taking a trip /none/ taliesin sure  marisha oh are we all going down to the ziggurat  laura yeah travis nothing else to do  marisha sure  matt all right you make your way  down to the basement area of whitestone castle  into the family catacombs  which have been cleaned up and you can see  cassandra has put a little bit of care into restoring it to what it was before  the tunnel that was carved in has been given a little more support  and as youre making your way down a familiar tunnel  the /none/ same tunnel where you had the showdown with orthax  you hear a few voices  from up ahead  two familiar voices  you hear the echo of some older gruff elderly gentleman  and a little more rambunctious familiar voice  as they turn the corner you see them deep in conversation  its the realmseer himself hunched forward  with his white hair and balding top turns around  and its a great mystery to me  that they can put a oh look theyve returned  vox machina themselves  gilmore at this point opens his /none/ arms standing and healthy  my god ive been waiting for you  laura laughs ashley and marisha aww  matt and all of you so graciously clean  laura you

laughs hes like  chuckles so ive heard  weve spent a little bit of time  looking at this strange oddity beneath the city  and im not going to lie to you its really confusing  ive a few theories on it as does the arcanist  but were still comparing notes  and we dont want to jump to any conclusions  as tests have been inconclusive and rather dangerous so far  however before anything else goes underway i believe theres  a very /none/ important bit of business that we must attend to  sam business what business gilmore  matt and he walks straight up to grog and just gives you a big hug  sam aww laura oh  matt and pats you on the shoulder and is like  chuckling you big lug  travis you gilmore  laughter  matt walks over to you pike and kneels down and gives you  a little pinch on the cheek

marisha i give him a hug back  matt vax  laura giggles  matt vaxildan light of my eye smiling boy  /none/ laughter  matt and he walks up and puts his hands across your shoulders  and kind of cups your face  ive missed you most of all  and pulls you in for a big hug and lifts you up off the ground  liam oh hey you  laura youre strong enough to be careful of your wound gilmore  matt as he sets you down he’s like  ooh i shouldnt have done that my apologies  liam i pat him on the ribs  matt dont touch that its still very tender  liam its fantastic /none/ to see you  youre a sight for sore eyes yourself were very happy to see you  matt my sight is sore so this works out well  but please these tunnels are dank and not becoming of us  dinner should be happening soon  and you should join us now that youve returned please  marisha oh before dinner i think we were all just curious  on the state of the ziggurat as we were calling it  laura the orb matt lets talk over dinner  marisha spinning orb of death is what we call /none/ it  matt lets talk over dinner marisha all right yeah sure  travis wait you said you were doing tests on it right  did you throw things at it did it blow up  matt that is part of the test nothing blew up things did go away  travis they went away  laura they get sucked in grog  matt well talk over dinner  i hate to have this discussion without allura here  i think this would only behoove the conversation  if were all present  taliesin an excellent argument  laura we /none/ have some delicious and very expensive wine  matt chuckling well  ashley expensiveass wine liam yeah  laura expensiveass wine we could bust out with dinner  matt color me intrigued  laura oh i havent got to wink in a really long time you guys  it felt so good  marisha back to your old self liam hard life  matt it was a good wink finest in the land  well come to the surface then this place is dreary  taliesin yes  matt you too eskil  matt aye  too many smiles in /none/ this area i like it its jovial  dont see that around these places too often  its good to see all of you come now yes lets move  matt you all eventually make your way back to the surface to whitestone  marisha i go to vex and pike and go  is this a good opportunity for us to break out our formal wear  ashley gasps yes laura definitely dear  marisha okay  travis oh jeez  taliesin i genuinely have no idea what youre talking about  marisha the ladies take  like 20 /none/ minutes  travis lets be honest its 2 hours taliesin 40 minutes  travis fucking 20 minutes my ass  on what plane are you  right now laughs  laura laughs  marisha not the feywild  but maybe soon  ashley theres magic involved  taliesin same plane as the break room 5 minutes is 15 laughs  marisha laughing yes yes yeah  travis ill be 20 minutes the next day  liam on the way out as were all walking out  i walk along with gilmore and i give him  just a gentle shoulder /none/ shoulder to shoulder and say  its really good to see you on your feet  its the best smile ive had in ages  matt you and me both  laura while were getting ready  i would like to talk to pike  about a certain proposal that happened  none of us have addressed it  ashley i know because i just  laura what happened ashley what should i do  laura what did you tell him did you tell him yes did you tell him no  ashley im just so  marisha hang on /none/ what exactly did he say by the way  ashley i just said well circle back  laura well circle back marisha circle back  laura laughing how did he take that  ashley i think he was fine with it he just understands that i just  marisha treat proposals like we do our dungeons  laughs we circle back  ashley isnt that the only way to just treat all things  i guess i dont know i dont know  marisha giggles laura how do you feel about him pike  ashley i just dont know i /none/ just feel so confused  marisha i understand that  ashley he wears you down a little  liam cracks up  ashley and theres  something there for him  marisha i dont know if thats a good reason to say yes though  ashley oh i dont know  hes just very charming  marisha and laura he is very charming  laura and i noticed hes becoming more charming  ashley yes i know  marisha yeah what is with that i didnt know that was possible  ashley how i feel like he goes to sleep /none/  and then the next morning  hes like  ashley and laura even more charming  laura i dont understand it  ashley why is that marisha i dont know  laura like every once in a while i look at him and i go  marisha yeah no and then i feel really  laura no but hes small  but at the same time im kind of interested  marisha right and you kind of think about it for a second  and you entertain it  and then you feel really gross about yourself  laura /none/ you feel like yeah ashley yes yes  laura but if youre actually interested then its not gross at all  marisha no of course its not gross if youre actually interested  ashley i know i just groans  ive had feelings for someone for a long time  but maybe theyre slowly fading i dont know  laura wait marisha wait what  ashley i have i dont know if i feel comfortable talking about it  but its fine  laura we dont want to push you pike but you know its just us girls here  /none/ marisha i know and weve been through so many uncomfortable things together  ashley groans  marisha most of life is so uncomfortable  be comfortable right now  ashley i just i dont know  its still something that i need to think about  laura all right marisha we understand  ashley im just  laura you pray to your sarenrae about it  ashley okay laughs  you do look lovely though in your dress  laura you look beautiful marisha you look so cute  laura ashley and marisha laugh  ashley thanks ashley i do /none/ a

tight grunts  laura can you breathe  marisha strained no but that means its right  laura all right marisha all right im good  taliesin i assume theres clean clothes  for everybody in their quarters  matt yeah its all good  travis im wearing the same shit  laughter /none/  sam and the big hat travis yeah  matt laughing to dinner shoonk  travis laughing yeah i paid money for this thing  taliesin and im going to arrange for our stuff to be stowed in the vault  matt okay not a worry  all right so as the sun sets  you find your way down to the proper dinner table  gilmore is there eskil is there cassandra is there  marisha we look fabulous matt you guys look fantastic  sam they do marisha yes we do  matt fine outfits have been provided /none/ for the men  if they wish to wear them as well some do not  taliesin oh i am dressed liam im dressed yeah  sam oh ill dress up ill dress up for dinner  matt all righty as you guys sit down  pleasantries are exchanged  yawns pardon me  you catch up a bit with cassandra partway through  laura aw matt  matt what  liam e3 yall  taliesin sit down have a beer  watch our game  marisha laughs 2 pm  matt within the next 15 minutes or so  /none/ before food is brought to the table  allura finally enters in a very very nice dress and says  it is so good to see you all are safe  marisha allura ashley hello  laura i give her a hug  matt she then gives you a big wonderful hug  laura hows kima we havent seen her yet  matt well  she looks over this way and kima walks in  for the first time youve seen her  really out of armor since you first saw her  her hair is also in similar braids /none/ to her side  and she herself is wearing a golden dress  though shes kind of like  travis yeah i know the feeling  laughter  matt she comes in  marisha kima matt hello  ashley oh you look lovely  marisha keyleth goes over and gives her a hug  matt she gives you a hug and goes  its good to see you guys im glad youre all right  this feels weird does this feel weird this feels weird  marisha its only for a few hours dont worry about it  travis what /none/ are you wearing  matt thats what im saying do i have to wear  hes not wearing anything do i have to wear  laura you dont have to wear a dress kima  matt you dont have to wear it kima it was just a suggestion  laura chuckles  matt im going to go change ill be right back  travis yeah go change  matt she darts off for a bit and allura smiles and facepalms a bit  sam you two are at the kiddie table  laughter  liam you ought to let her /none/ try that helmet on later  sam show some class man  travis laughs  matt you guys catch up a bit as allura speaks  about her and drakes escape from westruun  kima eventually comes back wearing ratty clothing  shirt pants the general wear shed pick up throughout the city  and is still carrying her small maul at her side  its like her little comfort blanket thud next to the table  travis yeah thats better  matt she scoots up next to allura  gilmore snaps his fingers  and wine begins to pour /none/ from the servants cassandra says  well thank you all for coming  i believe there is much to get underway here thisa  matt and she gestures towards gilmore and allura they nod  eskil raises his hand a moment  matt so while youve been gone  allura youve been doing this research for a bit  thank you thank you so weve been trying  to ascertain the nature of the ziggurat beneath the city  the ziggurat itself is built over  what appears to be an ancient temple of ioun  the glass substance  /dung/ the diluted whitestone that has been reformed into glass  is used as a very strong arcane current  a lot of energy was being placed in this location  as there is an actual what appears to be  an arcane leyline a nexus point  near and above whitestone hence the sun trees placement  taliesin yes of course  matt and why it flourishes so well in this region  but everything within a certain vicinity of this temple  of this dark spot if you will is eaten  doesnt vanish its not cancelled its taken /none/ devoured  everything placed within that small little globule of darkness  is taken somewhere as well  now at first we thought maybe it was just destroying  but the arcane energy we feel  the flow of it its drawing it somewhere  meaning that this is not what i had feared to be  a sphere of annihilation an object of complete destruction  instead it feels like its a siphon  now a siphon siphons are very old siphons were used in the first war  they were used as a means  of transferring extremely /none/ powerful  raw magical powers  they were placed strategically throughout the worlds crust  at these various nexus points  as a means of creating extremely powerful relics  the ones that you seek the ones that made the vestiges themselves  were crafted through the use of some of these siphons  but they have been lost and many thought  destroyed for a very long time or at least inert  i have reason to believe that this may be one  and it may be active  as to where the other side lies i do /none/ not know  because each siphon has two points  taliesin so its fair to assume that at the other end of this  is something old something trapped something hungry  matt perhaps  laura would it be in this plane or another  matt i have no idea  everything weve attempted to put through it  that had any sort of magical connection  whether it be through interplanal scrying  anything that would bring us to the other side of this  is crushed consumed and transferred as part of it  none of our rituals /none/  or enchantments  will let us see through this spinning marble as you call it  laura you havent put any blood through it though  taliesin lets not  laura no im hoping  that hasnt happened  marisha so nothing survives  the transfer  it is destroyed into its purest components it sounds  matt seemingly yes  liam or is it dont know  is it that you have no idea what happened to things put through  matt were still delving into it  and it may be a little while before we figure /none/ this out  but this is the best i can ascertain with my knowledge at my disposal  and the realmseer and gilmore can back up this research  weve all worked together these past weeks  and were all kind of coming to the same conclusion  she gestures to gilmore gilmore says  ive only been on this case personally  for a few days  of rising health standards in my body  and ive thrown everything i can at it honestly  and its all just come to nothing gone pthbbt  taliesin this is disappointing /none/  matt youre telling me travis what about a person  matt laughing im not sending a person through there  marisha to be fair grog i might have tried that a little  sam what taliesin yes thats right  marisha i sort of stuck my hand in the spinning ball of death  and lets just say  im glad im still here standing with you all  laura was it sucking you in  marisha it did a considerable  amount of damage to my hand  and definitely felt like it was sucking me in  /none/ and i had to resist pretty hard  but it seems like anything that goes in that sphere  doesnt come out the other end intact  laura gilmore any of you allura  have you experienced any kind of draw toward the orb  do you feel different having been around it for very long  matt gilmore cocks a curious eye to the realmseer  the realmseer thinks and scratches his chin  looks to allura  allura looks down at the table with her arms crossed  looks to kima  kimas finishing her big drink  /none/ i stay away from it it creeps the hell out of me  not to my knowledge do you think we should be worried  laura well i dont know  i mean it is a very strong relic that we dont know how it works  matt the difficulty in our research  is most of our means of inspection are well  laura up close and personal matt of arcane nature  taliesin i was hoping that perhaps we could talk  about some engineering possibilities of finding ways  that science can measure what it is where /none/ magic cannot  something safe  sam scoffs science percy  taliesin in this sense as it stands  matt were open to all possible suggestions  were kind of at the end of our rope for the time being  we may send a few of us across the way to well  a few different places for more information  may do a bit of traveling ourselves it seems  taliesin ill sketch something with my copious free time  matt hm please do  sam no dragons have buzzed by here in our absence  matt they /none/ kind of look to themselves  none yet but weve been very careful  were in the process of installing some semblance of  sighs for lack of a better term sort of a screen  ways to reflect and perhaps cloud anyone  who attempts to peer too far into the northern regions of whitestone  the last thing we need  is any of these dragons finding their way up north  where youve kept all of us and the refugees safe  so were trying not to piss any of them off  while also trying to /none/ make sure that maybe theyre  not really looking behind this curtain of cloud  taliesin any fortifications would be helpful  laura dont dragons sort of see past those things  matt were doing our best to try and meet those standards  taliesin i have another request in that direction that might help  if there was a way to spread the word in this city  and amongst those who travel to not speak of us  we should probably not be hailed in this city at all  our names should be stricken from any record /none/ of it  matt allura leans forward  on the table  no i see youre right  there is merit in that though it will be difficult  many here look up to you  they see you as the salvation of this city  but i believe we can go about and speak with them  and help instill the idea that its for the better good  that you are not mentioned  taliesin best to be nameless at this point  marisha its for their own safety taliesin its for everybodys  laura wewhomustnotbenamed sam the /none/ unmentionables  taliesin cracks up youre a terrible person  laura gasps i love it  marisha yeah my choice is the unmentionables i like it  matt allura says i did find some research  on some of these vestiges you are seeking  taliesin oh laura yes  matt from what i could bring forth  from the cobalt reserve in westruun  there is an artifact that lies in the feywild  swallowed by a terrible tree  laura yes the warden  matt is that the name of it laura the wrath of the fey warden /none/  matt so youve found some information yourself  laura just the name  sam and that its in the feywild but nothing more  matt sighs this tree that holds it its a tree seeded by the betrayal  of an archfey whose hatred burned into a black heart of disease  the cleansing rivers of the gilded run  prevent the spread  of the shademirk bog that seeps from it  travis sounds nasty  matt it doesnt sound very fun no  sam the shademark balg  matt the shademirk bog sam ugh it sounds awful /none/  matt it seeps from this tree  it is held at bay by the rivers of the gilded run  marisha the rivers are called the gilded run  matt mmhm  sam okay well that helps us those are clues  laura yeah yeah yeah  marisha and the shademirk bog  pours out of the tree  laura out of the cancerous tree  marisha the tree is responsible for a swampy bog  matt from best i could ascertain from my research yes  laura and fenwraths whats the name  sam fenthras wrath of the /none/ fey warden  laura fenthras is inside of the tree that is terrible  matt it is very possible  taliesin oh no sam okay  liam do you know anything about the vestige itself  matt i dont unfortunately most of the cobalt reserve was destroyed  and i was under siege at the moment from the return of the dragons sighs  laura did you happen to find in your research what perhaps  we might face in the feywild  i mean weve learned a little bit of it  but i know that its going to /none/ be rather dangerous  matt ive not been there myself  to be honest it creeps me out  laura laughs travis laughs no sorry  matt i did find also about the spire of conflux  it is a staff that can bend the elements  and was taken into the abyss  by joran the seaspeaker hero of the verdant expanse  about four centuries back and was never heard from again  marisha joran the what matt joran the seaspeaker  sam he speaks to the sea  matt perhaps  taliesin or just the letter c /dung/ laura laughs  sam cookie monster travis hero  matt i do have some research about the dragons as well  laura oh  matt ive done a bit of looking into the personality types  the habits of some of these chromatics you may be coming up against  the black dragon you seemingly already dealt with  if word has come to me correctly  laura yes  matt which is magnificent and well done very dangerous  lets hope they dont decide to strike back soon  laura good thing we didnt provoke them in the cave /none/ at all percival  taliesin if they came there they wouldve been provoked  i figured  matt i did find that the white dragons theyre more primal  theyre overall less intelligent than other chromatics  and some  of this information you know  laura yeah why am i writing this down i know this shit  matt but what they do is they  sighs well dont let the lack of intelligence  lull you into comfort  they are also unpredictable and raw  dangerous hunters  they stalk in ruined lands of ice and vengeance /none/  their memory is eternal  they recall every slight defeat  and have been known to hold vendettas for centuries and centuries  they despise other dragons  and this loose alignment with thordak  is stranger than the others for the white dragon  though vorugals distance to the others is intentional most likely  i mean the entire alignment between them is strange anyway  but particularly with the white dragon  they generally steer very clear of or are bent on destroying  any other types of dragons that may wander in their midst  laura /none/ whispering interesting  matt green dragons in particular are manipulative  liars by nature finding pleasure in power over others  through deceit and promises of wealth and glory they corrupt  they play subservience to other dragons  then plot their demise to claim their hoards  theyre the seedy underbelly of the chromatic world if you will  they amass powerful allies human and beyond to their will  bending them and using them as tools  their life and their very presence  is poison to those around them  and is the very basis  of /none/ their danger  they corrupt the air around them to be venomous  i found a bit about this raishan you mentioned  and word has spoken though little that exists out there  that she is also a very practitioned  weaver of the arcane arts so be warned  marisha so much so  that she could almost pass as a druid wielding natural magic  matt i can imagine thats quite within her grasp  ive heard rumors of her calling the sky down upon her enemies  previous individuals that hoped to raid her space  /none/ were swallowed in quaking earth as she laughed from above  sam druidy things  marisha i want to kill her so hard strained i want her to die  taliesin do we know where these  where these dragons have been all this time  where they were banished to  matt i mean most of these dragons  lived their lives wherever they once were before  raishan used to exist in the mountains outside of syngorn  and actually had amassed  a sizeable horde of followers lizardmen lizardfolk all sorts  taliesin wait then thordak was /none/ banished to the fire plane  matt thordak we had banished yes thordak in particular  now red dragons are true tyrants built on impulse and rage  arrogant to the core  they see themselves as rightful rulers over all  and thordak the king of all other dragons as well  he is powerful enough to amass networks  of spies and followers far beyond  just the dragons that weve battled im sure  so the more time that passes  the more powerful that network will become  laura muffled oh fuck  taliesin ive had /none/ a terrible thought  and it is sort of my business to have terrible thoughts  what else has been banished to the fire plane  travis the djinn  taliesin well i say this  because if i were to slowly open the portal to the fire plane  and power it and make it bigger and bigger and bigger  eventually it would be a hole into that dimension  thats big enough for a dragon to fit through  but still not big enough for me  so i need to keep eating to make it bigger /none/  laura gasps  taliesin and maybe they might be looking for whats down there  so they can feed it and make a bigger hole  just a thought it may be nothing  laura you think theres something bigger than thordak in the fire plane  taliesin i have terrible thoughts its a terrible thought  marisha i mean im sure there is something bigger than thordak  probably in the fire plane  but the fire ashari closed the portal  taliesin that may not have been the portal  marisha that was the portal  that /none/ thordak came out of it ripped apart my entire  taliesin that may just be where he escaped  that power may still be flowing  marisha well allura how did you lock him in the fire plane to begin with  matt well we had through clever subterfuge  managed to have a member of our team  work as a follower of thordak  work into his greater trust  and convince him that to perpetuate his wealth  his growth his strength  that he needed to truly embrace the essence of fire  and there are /none/ crystals  there are remnants of the first war  that exist in this world and others  the very core of the elemental chaos itself  the hearts of the titans left behind  these heartstones are the very basis  or at least shadows of the basis  of what made the elements when creation came to be  we had found one of these on the fire plane  but the nature of these is that they cannot be removed  if they are brought beyond the plane themselves  they generally shatter  and the few /none/ that can be brought across temporarily  the magics that contain them do weaken  and those that attempted to harness their power  leave it to ruin destroying all around them  before it whirls itself into a frenzy  of uncontrollable arcane mass and destroys everything nearby  these were many of the fools  who ushered in the beginning of the second war  so essentially we convinced thordak  to find one of these in the plane  and convinced him that he had the power to contain it  once there all of our forces /none/ gathered  and we attacked him pressed him down  and the gem that we had convinced him  the heartstone that we had convinced him  to take into himself  well we found a way to seal it  to banish it permanently to that plane so that he could not escape  marisha all right so thats all good  but he did escape  laura could he still potentially have it inside of him  marisha exactly that was my question  sam well she asked it so technically its hers  matt she turns and /none/ you can see gilmores sitting at the table like this  i got a very good close at that dragon  a very good close look to finish my sentence  ive been drinking plenty of wine tonight dont judge me  ashley expensiveass wine  taliesin its the best wine  matt it is very expensive fine wine  travis matt’s vineyard is the best  matt thank you grog its wondrous  marisha laughs  matt but his mass  his unforeseen size to a creature like that  i couldnt help but notice that within his torso /none/  there was a pulsing heart  of red glass  laura all right  taliesin look how clever food makes all of us  matt he looks over to allura  allura nods  well if that is the case then its i think  theres very much a chance  that he did escape with the heartstone intact  travis i have a question  weve got one of the vestiges  in these titanstone knuckles made from the heartstone  if i left the plane with these  are they gonna blow everybody up  matt an /none/ intact heartstone is the true source of power  those have been carved from one an inert one or at least  they carry but a smidgen of the power  i think youre safe grog  travis oh thank god ashley phew  laura which one  travis kord laura oh kord i got it chuckles  matt allura leans in again  i have been keeping an eye on emon from this distance as well  it seems that thordaks very essence  twists the land with elemental magic  travis whispering oh shit  matt my distant /town/ views of the city  have shown the center of the town cracked with volcanic fire  as he digs and burrows beneath the city itself  taliesin whispering fuck laura oh fuck  travis wait why is he digging and burrowing  liam hes reshaping the land as he sees fit  travis or is he looking for something laura because hes a dick  travis is he not looking for something  taliesin he might be looking for something  or might be making  marisha so these heartstones  embrace the essence  of where they reside /none/  matt their essence is created where they reside  marisha and he has the heartstone of the fire elemental plane  living inside of him  matt a heartstone there are many marisha a heartstone right  laura im confused  travis i need more wine  do you think he was just making himself at home  or do you think he was looking for something  matt i dont know he seems pretty lax  from what i could tell from my investigations  the major step in the conclaves plan  is already over  laura /none/ take over everything  matt now they settle into the divided territories  and forget each other  now i feel that thordak is far too old and covetous  to be content with just emon  now this was vengeance which is now complete  who knows what the next stage in his terrible design is  marisha so youre thinking  the chroma conclave was simply a temporary alliance  matt there are very few  permanent alliances  between chromatic dragons  laura well thats good marisha we can use this  laura maybe they wont take /none/ vengeance  ashley maybe we can get one of them on our side  taliesin we can only be so hopeful that they tear each other apart  laura maybe the white one will want to help kill thordak with us  marisha turning them against each other is not a bad idea  taliesin our best hope at this point is just to amass power  we are not strong enough  laura no  taliesin but we will get stronger  laura does the heartstone make him even stronger than he already was  matt i dont know /town/  but he was not that large when we sealed him  laura shit travis seize  marisha so we can take yeah  laura if we can pry it out of his body  we could shrink him down  perfect plan  sam then we could go inside a dragon again  laura we can go in another dragon  liam every one of them one after the other  travis you seen any dragons on the outskirts of the town  have there been any flyovers or close calls within say  50 to 100 miles or /none/ so any reports  matt hundred miles  there were reports of the white dragon a week ago  south of us far south of us  travis far south  laura doing what just flying  matt just flying flying east  taliesin unless they know whats underneath the castle  theres nothing of value here  liam do we know where vorugal has taken up roost no one knows  matt no ive tried to scry  but theyre apparently protected against that now  travis what about means of protection for whitestone  do you have a /none/ defense planned a warning system  matt were just getting now to that point  it may be a few weeks before were ready to go  its a lot to build and its a very big space to protect  but me and drake are working on some ideas sighs  marisha do you know exactly how these heartstones are forged  matt theyre not forged they existed  they were the hearts of the primordial titans  that existed on this world before the gods even came here  marisha oh thats right laura wow  matt they /none/ were the true denizens of this world before any of us  sam this is an awesome dinner by the way super good  laura so good taliesin i love game meat  matt im sorry its been a very tense time  laura this wine is pretty good ashley its very good  matt perhaps rest is in order for all of us  its been a lot im so sorry its good to see all of you  travis you as well laura youve done so much  matt allura brightens up a little bit you can see /none/ that she feels guilty  that she just did this information dump and is like  sighs its good to see all of you  marisha it was good to see you  matt sighs well let us rest for the evening  drinks the last of her wine stands up  well talk on the morrow  she gets up kima  im coming let me finish  laura and marisha laugh  matt no seriously its good to see you all  im glad youre all right  laura you should have been with us  matt i /none/ shouldve been with you i didnt know you left  laura sorry kima were dicks  matt is westruun okay  laura its better  marisha whispering its not great though  laura its getting better taliesin it lives it lives  sam thats true marisha it stands  matt does my house still stand  hesitant noises  sam whats a house really but a bunch of bricks  matt oh its fine  marisha home is where you make it kima  matt object impermanence glug glug  next time youre going there you tell me  laura /none/ oh yes we will  taliesin we will be returning  travis on one condition dont wear any more dresses  laura laughs  matt you saying i wasnt pretty grog  travis i like you in your armor better  matt thats why i missed

your respective rooms  resting for the night  some doors adorned differently than /none/ others  partway into the evenings resting  well say the wee hours of the morning postmidnight or so  your door opens slightly vax  you hear a little knocking sound on your door  liam yes  matt you look over and you see gilmore pop his head in with a soft smile  im sorry if im waking you up  liam its all right  matt here  and he produces what looks like a folded pile of material  and throws it on the foot of your bed and goes  come vax i made /dung/ you a gift  put it on come walk with me awhile we have a lot to talk about  liam i open it up  matt its a very wellcrafted silk robe of dark blue and black  beaded nice against the skin its really really nice  liam quietly give me a minute  louder theres a wooden screen in the room  i go behind it and wipe any oil left off my butt  laughter  matt thats fantastic  liam everything looks all right and i put it on  matt all right  he /none/ waits for you patiently in the hallway  so he begins walking along puts his arm out to you  liam take it  matt you take his arm you guys walk up along the hallway  he leads you to a staircase that leads up further and he goes  i know a lot has happened these recent months  ive been watching from afar  keeping tabs on your journey best that i can  but i still know so little  you ascend the lengthy staircase  and you make your way to the higher floor  /none/ you eventually open an intricate door  and walk out onto a wide balcony on that tower  that overlooks the grounds and the castle before you  beautiful moonlight the night air  you see the moon is nearly full and the white light illuminates  the denselyforested countryside surrounding the castle  he closes the door  and walks up to you at the edge of the balcony  looking over it all elbows on the edge  some time has passed vax  and much of the world moves on to newer greater threats  but true /none/ pain never really heals  he turns to you  and steps up to you looking you close in the face  you hurt me deeply and continue to hurt  agony for weeks months  pain i had never experienced  deepening to a growl its all i can think about  liam can i make an insight check  matt you would if you had time  marisha oh my god laura gasps i knew it i knew it  marisha no  matt the pain hits you suddenly before anything else does  as youre lost in /none/ that face and the sudden feeling  the sensation  of terror and horror  you suffer 18 points  of piercing damage  and i need you to make a constitution saving throw  liam oh thats my specialty  taliesin whispering we dont know what the hell this is  liam constitution save matt mmhmm  liam 11  matt you feel the poison  liam ill use luck matt roll again  liam 18  matt you feel what should be a pulse of poison hit your system  and you manage to fight it off as /none/ suddenly you look down  and there is gilmore holding a blade thrust into your stomach  your robes now beginning to fill with crimson red around the wound  its at that moment you see him pull you in and stare into your face  with a very low growl  its all i think about  and you watch as a flicker to his form happens  and you see for a second theres a flash not skin but fur  you see teeth you see whiskers  and the hand holding the dagger is facing the other /none/ direction  thats where were going to end tonights session
