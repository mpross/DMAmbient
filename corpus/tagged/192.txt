/none/ matt welcome everyone to this  thursdays episode of critical role  where a bunch of us nerdyass voice actors get together and play dungeons  dragons  this will be our 10th episode i think  which is awesome  for all the classic folks that have been coming every week  good to see you again for a bunch  of newcomers out there as well  welcome and thank you i hope you enjoy  were going to cut to some videos here probably the last time  that we run the character backstories at the start /none/ of the show  we usually use it as partially a stall method  when some of our players havent gotten here on time  clears throat ie scanlan but hes on his way im sure  but also since we have a lot of new people watching  and we figured it would be cool for them to actually get an idea  of the character backgrounds as well  but going forward  well just be playing them for the intermission break  so well be back here in about 10 minutes or so  in the meantime /town/ enjoy the character backstories  well see you guys in just a moment  dramatic music  ashley pike grew up  on the outskirts of town  near the bramblewood  her ancestors  were a family of deep gnomes  with quite an unfavorable reputation  thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse  of the last name trickfoot  sarenrae  the goddess of healing and redemption  had other plans for pikes  greatgreatgrandfather wilhand  who left his family at a young age after a dream  a dream that changed the /none/ course  of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on  that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion  as a child  pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people  or even flowers  she felt she had a purpose  in making things whole  that had once been broken  she studied and learned  the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life  quiet and simple  until one day /none/  wilhand was captured and almost killed  by a group of goliath barbarians  one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome  and he himself was beaten bloodied  and left for dead abandoned by his herd  wilhand went to pike for help  she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered  his name was grog strongjaw  after that they were best of friends a rather unlikely pair  little did she know  that /none/ in a few years time  grog would soon return the favor  and bring her back  from the clutches of death  roar crunch  after being killed in battle  pike felt angry  she wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again  she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other  this time pike is ready  travis right listen up  if you have ale /none/  then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite  for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted  for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years  armed with his twohanded great axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks  of his familys wandering herd  /none/ but after coming upon an unsuspecting  elderly gnome in the woods  he objected to the killing  of such an innocent life  a creature of impulse  grog felt only pity for this  well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished  by the herd leader his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd  it was then that the relative  of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him  it was the kindness  /none/ of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog  bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends  ever since  most nights grog can be found  challenging entire taverns  to wrestling matches ha  or accompanying scanlan  to the nearest house  where you pay forÂ… lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth  would leave you with little information on the halfelven druid  you might even think  that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing  is kind of /none/ sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise  to underestimate her  based on first impressions thunder  under that unintimidating petite frame  is a vicious beast  waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions  pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe  of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics  it is her peoples inherent duty  to protect  the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes /none/  begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl  she had quite a knack  for air manipulation  and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long  before the headmaster of the tribe  her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities  and she was inveterated  to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that  her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced  with endless spell /none/ memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leader to be  must embark on journey  to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce  and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente  or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready  he set her on the path  to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if  she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain  towards stillben  she meditated on the task /none/ ahead  part of the aramente  is proving yourself a strong warrior  a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge  one thought plays on repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children  born to a noble family who lived  far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone  with so many siblings  to share the burdens of lordship  percy turned his attentions  to the sciences  engineering and naturalism  one day a /dung/ mysterious couple named  lord and lady briarwood came to court  during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently  took control of the castle  killing or imprisoning  everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon  only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men  as they ran percys sister took  several arrows to the chest and fell  percy kept running  eventually jumping into a freezing river  and floating unconscious to freedom  /none/ he did not remember  waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered  the next two years  as he slowly made his way  as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke  offered him vengeance  against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke  percy began to design his first gun  gunshot  sam oh you havent heard  of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eye on you  a talented musician /none/ master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much  as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome  scanlan used his endless charm  and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin  and support his single mother  one day he was discovered  by a halforc promoter  and joined dr dranzels  spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of the world  and honed his skills  as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life  scanlan has never /town/ quite come to terms  with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion  while his years on the road  provided many shall we say  educational experiences  with the opposite sex  deep down scanlan yearns  for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself  a lover first performer second  and fighter distant third  on the battlefield  hell support his allies  but rarely draws blood  unless its to protect  fellow gnome /town/ pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh  a rollicking song  and a twinkle in his eye  that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded  in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic  the judges and the draconian high council  were amazed  at how powerful my spells were /none/  for how long i had been training  at 20 years old  i was the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history  for the next few years  i almost went mad from the malaise  of being a guild member  as its rather boring  however one day  i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books  and maps of the surrounding cities  and areas around the known world  for months  i would frequent the chamber /none/  and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research  i made a list of artifacts  that caught my eye  i brought these findings  to the high council  and was told  that all of the information  in the chamber i had stumbled upon  was either believed to be fiction  or unsolvable mysteries  and hence were lost forever  i found those answers  to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse  and managed to convince the city council  to lend support /town/ in me leaving draconia  on a mission of peace and diplomacy  for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town  and making friends and allies  in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands  in that respect  but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world  and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that  /none/ i am much sharper  than most give me credit for  i just dont pay attention  to things sometimes  ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky  and well dangerous  i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then  but overall i think im quite friendly  for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome  in the company of elves or men  vaxildan learned at a young age  to skip past formality  preferring instead  to invite himself in your door  along /town/ with twin sister vexahlia  vax was born by a chance encounter  between elven royalty  and human peasantry  raised by their mother  in their early years  the twins were eventually sent off  to their father  in the elven capital of syngorn  but their cool reception  among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last  the siblings stole away one autumn night  and set out on the open road  after a few years of wandering  they eventually decided  to return to /none/ their mother  and journeyed back  to the lands of their youth  but instead of finding  their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone  their home burned to ash  pressing the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day  the dragon came  roar  with their ties all severed  vaxildan and his sister set out  to find their fortune together  in taldorei  an outsider since birth  vax quickly learned  to solve lifes challenges  in his own particular /none/ way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack  for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping  the way of blades  the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves  vexahlia has spent most of her life  suffering the cool reception  of a people who dont fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life  took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan  quickly realized /none/  the only people  they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother  and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city  for which their father was an ambassador  he quietly took them in  but always kept an icy distance  and after too many years  of disdainful looks  the pair decided  to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities  /none/ stealing small trinkets  and learning the ways of the thief  while vex kept to the woods she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer  she learned to hunt and to track  to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion  in the form of a bear  her own stolen trinket  to fight alongside her  and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable  and gives expert massages  dramatic music  matt hello everyone welcome back to critical role  first /dung/ off i want to thank the chat for buying this amazing cloak  this most delightful dungeon master cloak

recommendation /town/ from tiberius stormwind  taliesin i like that you two match actually  laura the episode of dread part 2 came out today of tabletop  its so intense you can watch it on geek  sundry  im not telling you anything but its very intense  taliesin we cant talk about anything  sam did we talk about the shirts  orion i dont think we did  matt lets get this on the road then so we can get into the story  laura im so nervous travis laughing i dont want to live  matt so /none/ to get everyone caught up to where we are  the party was initially sent on a quest  into the mountainous region beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer  to find a folk hero of the region named lady kima of vord  whos a halfling paladin who had gone missing  while on a vision quest that had apparently led her to some evil  that was brewing beneath the city  as the party went in search of her they ended up finding themselves  climbing deeper and deeper into the underdark  a very scary portion /dung/ of the subterranean world  encountering numerous beasts and talking cellphones  orion sorry  all laugh  sam disadvantage  matt discovering that there was  apparently an alliance  that had been forged  between the illithids  the mind flayers that lived down there  and the duergar who normally are at odds theyve forged some sort of pact  upon battling their way deeper  into the cavernous regions below the lavaencrusted obsidian walls  they began to uncover a plot that apparently some monstrosity  some new dark leader by the name of kvarn  /none/ had been the one responsible for uniting them  and currently resides in a temple in the center  of the subterranean illithid city of yugvoril  you guys made your way down to what seems to be the cavern  that contains the island that yugvoril resides upon  you manage to scavenge a few broken boats from the lake that surrounds the island  percy repaired them and you rode around the outskirts  to what seemed to be some sort of a beachside cavern  upon entering the cavern  you found a partiallyburied chest or container /none/ of some kind  in what looks like a camp that had been destroyed and scattered  and a few rotting corpses against the walls  as you continued to inspect the area  the corpses began to rise from their sitting positions  with previous experience in the realm of undead  you however know that these eyes of these creatures  carry far more intelligence than your runofthemill zombie  and that was where we left off at this point in time  which requires a music change  ashley oh just jumping right in laura just right /none/ into it  matt right in  we have a good number of the party that is still out in the boat  that is being towed by keyleth currently in shark form  ashley were in a boat taliesin were in a boat  ashley im in a boat im in a motherfucking boat  matt theres keyleths shark form  laura where awesome  matt right there  so in the cavern i believe we had vax we had scanlan  tiberius and vex on the flying carpet and are making their way down  you scouted ahead /none/  and began to check the interior  before this happened  so these creatures are now rising up off the ground  looking insidious in their expression all glaring at you  as youre the most apparentlynearby individual  what are you doing  laura you have fuzz in your hair matt and its going to stay  laura no you got it its gone matt aw damn it  matt i was hoping it would bother you for the rest of the game  so that being the case  were jumping right into battle at the top /none/ of this game  in the center of this beachside cavern roll initiative everybody  travis shit laura god  sam first roll of the night yeah travis fuck yes  taliesin bam  marisha new dice not bad sam wordless squeal  matt all right so top of the round whos got 25 to 20 anybody  taliesin 25 matt ooh percy with the rolls  matt okay so 25 travis and laura 20  matt 20 and 20 for grog and vex  all right 20 to 15  orion 16 matt 16 for tiberius

this youll be fine  sam well we roll well when it counts  ashley yeah but for initiative we always roll less  matt well thats the plate armor and i dont know why  and what have you guys got initiativewise  sam four ashley oh wow i got seven  matt pike then scanlan all /none/ right so top of the round  percy youre out in the ship are you going to stay on the ship  taliesin garbled no matt laughs  taliesin garbled these cookies are really good  matt i know timing is everything what are you doing quick  taliesin im going to tug on the rope three times in succession  to let our shark friend know that its time to boogie  im going to take the rope im going to jump out of the boat  is there anything to tie the rope to  matt this beach /none/ is just gravel theres no particular physical element  maybe on the far end there might be a part of the wall  but its going to be an awkward hinge and theres really nowhere to latch  taliesin is there something that if i had an adhesive that i could  matt well if you have an adhesive you might be able to stick it  to the wall at the far end of the beach the cavern wall that youre up against  but theres nothing actually on the beach floor at all  taliesin im going to /none/ attempt to take the piece of rope  place it against the wall  and take an ice shot slightly above the rope  and freeze it to the wall  matt okay so as you hold it up  you line up your enchanted ice chamber of your pepperbox  fire and with an extremely loud echoing gun noise gun shot sound  throughout the cavern you see a blast  the bullet itself ricochets and spins off into the distance  into the darkness but you do see left behind  where part of the rock has chiseled /none/ from the impact  ice has coalesced and cracked  and has for the time being  held the rope  to the edge of the cavern  taliesin im running in for the rest of my movement  matt all right so percy is there  percy its going to take you a few rounds to get there  its long winding pathway  but youre in the process of making your way there  all right great so that brings us to grog and vex  grog and vex what have you got  travis would you like /none/ to go laura well youre outside you can go  travis is the boat beached  on the shore yet  matt no the boat is not beached the rope that the boat is attached to  is currently attached to the wall so its anchored  travis okay good ashley and im in the boat  matt youre in the boat  grogs in the boat clarota kima  travis i would like to bust out at a full dead sprint after percy  theres no blood being had without me  matt as grog leaps out sploosh splashing /none/  its shallow at this point youre about waist deep in the water  you trudge up to the shore run across the gravel beach  and start heading  straight into the cavern after percy  travis screaming  matt yelling into the cavern a big old goliath scream  laser pointer if anyone needs it by the way there you go  all right that brings us to vex  laura which one looks biggest  matt youre still on top of the flying carpet the three of you  laura does one of the ghouls look scarier /none/ than the others  matt best you can tell there are three that all look similar in stature  theres one over here that is generally larger  taller more lanky and appears  to have a semblance of armor on him still  and he almost seems to be giving looks and silent commands to the others  laura hes a master zombie hunters mark him  matt whats the range on hunters mark youre back here  taliesin hey laura laura i did it  laura hunters mark 90 feet matt yeah you can get there  laura /none/ okay good well i dont need it  because im going to conjure barrage  a cone at them all  once hes hunters marked  sam barrage a cone sounds like an italian porn guy  matt hunters mark on that one  laura while i whistle for trinket to get his butt in  matt trinkets ears perk up from the distance  he can hear your whistle echoing through the cavern  on the beach side he stumbles out of the boat  sploosh big splash and chases after grog  laura okay and then i conjure /none/ barrage  matt all wet and soaked the fur pushed against the body  conjure barrage whats the range of that  laura its a 60foot cone  matt you are quite a distance from most of them  you might have to hop off the flying carpet  laura i will  orion she can move it just fine just think forward  laura can we fly the carpet forward  matt youre currently not in control of the carpet tiberius is  laura can i delay until whats your initiative  orion well 16 but thats fine  /none/ laura ill delay until his  can i do that  matt you can do that vex delays on that grogs turns ended  all right so the undead take their turn so as all the entities rise up  they all swarm in rushing around with an unnatural speed  liam age aint slowing them down nothing wow hi fellas  matt they all leap up you see portions of their jaw dangling  with these sharp awful blackened teeth that are broken and gnarled  liam i feel so popular  matt you glance around suddenly as this /none/ darkened room  which youre able to make a little bit of light  from tiberiuss light on the end of his staff  they move whoosh with a blur of speed and theyre right up in your face  taliesin 28 days later zombies  laura oh god get out of the middle of them  matt first thing you notice one of them  is giving off an awful stench  the smell you smelled when you first entered the cavern  is now so strong that its nearly overpowering  liam is there one specifically  matt /none/ its hard to find a source to it  however you are taking a claw strike from each of them  liam oh good  matt that is going to be a six that misses  matt that is a 19 liam yeah  matt hits 18 liam yeah  matt and then 20 liam hell yeah  matt all right so three claw strikes  you take seven points of slashing damage another seven points of slashing damage  and then a ten so thats  a total of 24 points of slashing damage  liam okay grunts  /none/ matt as all these horriblymuddied and halfrotted claws  start sinking past the armor into your flesh the back of your neck  one catches you in the side and it all happens so fast  you feel like youre almost spun around by the sheer force of the impact  i need you to make three constitution saving throws  sam theyve got poison or something  theyve got poison magic  liam okay 15 laura okay plus your constitution  liam plus nothing laura oh really  liam its all in speed man 15 matt 15  liam /none/ six matt all right  liam 19 matt okay  matt okay so two of the impacts you feel this sense of strange rot  impeding upon your system and you shrug it off  but one of them still manages to sift through and your system seizes  you feel all the muscles in your body begin to tighten up  and suddenly you are unable to move  your entire body is one tense giant flexing muscle  and youre unable to shift anywhere from your position  liam strained feels like rigor mortis  matt youre currently /none/ paralyzed  my friend  laura oh no i cant do anything you wont be able to dodge it  matt yeah all right that brings us to tiberius and vex  liam send a fireball right here  laura and sam no travis that would be bad  orion how far away am i right now  matt right here id say youre approximately  orion well ill move the carpet  the minimum distance i have to for her to get in range  matt you can probably push it 20 feet its about there  orion okay /dung/ so thats where ill stay this doesnt look good  i cast obelisk of stone on my dear friend fshh  im going to raise him up out of harms way  matt all right  so as you finish casting  you can see some of the actual sand that fills the bottom of this cave  begins to swirl up in a wind around tiberiuss hands  and as he lifts his arms up  a single column of stone shakes and shifts out of the ground  lifting your paralyzed body 15 feet into the air  /none/ thankfully the actual cavern itself is about 25 feet tall  so it doesnt crush you against the ceiling  orion no i only raise it about 20 feet  matt it can only go 15 feet for level 3 or 20 im sorry 20 feet  so youre barely brought up to the ceiling  it crests the top of your head  but not enough to actually crush you or do any damage  but you are seemingly out of harms way from the current undead onslaught  orion and then i go that was a good idea /none/  and then i spend three sorcerer points  and i hock a fireball fwoosh at all those fuckers too  matt all right so tiberius as you lift up the pillar with one hand  the dust settles and falls from your hand and as it does  this hand back here begins to coalesce this small bead of red burning energy  you fling it out with your off hand  it streaks across hits the base of the pillar  and explodes with a blast of red fiery magical energy  go ahead and roll damage  /none/ your dc on that is 17 right  orion yes two four six  is it six or eight  matt they all failed their saving throw its 8d6  sam 8d6 jeez seems unfair  matt same damage your lightning bolt does  sam oh youre right man im a bad mama jama  orion 32 damage matt 32 damage  matt so as you guys are running into the cavern  you hear this loud familiar explosion sound  that has this weird dull thud and then flaming heat  you see flickers of light from around the /none/ bend  and this wave of heat hits you the explosion as it finishes  you can see these three undead are completely incinerated  and are left as burning cinders on the ground  this ones still standing  however the force of the explosion also destroys the pillar from underneath  sam oh orion oh shit  all laugh  matt causing him to fall  orion hold on as he falls do i still have a movement after this  matt you used your movement to move the carpet sorry  marisha its like the tower of /none/ terror  liam how much bludgeoning damage am i taking  matt you only take id say 2d6 liam okay  matt no 1d6 because its only a 20foot fall  liam right okay  matt youre able to catch yourself and its also sand so its not too hard  all right that finishes your turn  orion it certainly does  vex would you finish that bastard off  matt wait you did land in a bunch of rocks of the broken pillar  roll another d6 points of damage  liam that was more substantial  matt /none/ if it was the sand  it wasnt so hard  but it was the fact that i realized there was a whole crapton of pillar rubble  that your paralyzed body fell upon unable to brace your fall  so thats going to hurt in the morning vex youre up  laura okay well theres no really anybody else so im going to  travis teasing theres no really  laura theres no really anybody else i can shoot through my fire thing right  matt if you want to yeah you still havent used it for the day /none/  laura should i save it  laura ill attack him twice matt okay youre attacking him twice  matt as youre sitting on the carpet you pull out schwoop schwoop  and rapidly release two arrows in succession  laura oh natural 20  all cheer  matt yeah all right and whats the other attack  laura 21  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  laura hit him oh actually 23 i forgot i had bracers on  matt that hits well the bracers only  affect your damage not to hit  laura good /none/ to know 21  matt you get 2 to all damage rolls with ranged attacks  laura what do i do for a critical then  matt you roll the regular damage multiply it by two  and then add your modifier at the end  laura okay oh thats not that good 15 for the first one  and 12 for the second one  matt and hunters mark on both of those  laura and hunters mark on both matt because its on the board laughs  laura that was definitely a six that was a six  /none/ matt there you go laura seven then for hunters mark  matt the smoke filters out of the way and you make the visual  you see your brother on the ground currently seizing  and in the rubble you see the shadow of one of the undead  still standing angrily  it rears back with its claws forward  and gives this horrible gnashing sound as its jaw opens and actually widens  this long tongue wet sucking noise whips out on it  as you bear down and release one arrow  shoomf piercing the side of /none/ its shoulder  as it reaches out to break it off its tongue still out  the second one goes into the tongue out the back of the throat  choking noise it reaches up and breaks off the arrow in the throat  looks towards you goes to lunge and as it does you can see  it just collapses on top of his body no longer moving  travis embrace him embrace him liam give me some sugar  matt all right so the rest of you  finally make your way into the cavern  you manage /none/ to shrug off the rest of this paralyzation  stiffly get up and find your way out of the rubble  laura can we land tiberius orion im sorry yes  travis tell me its not over  sam oh sorry grog the fights over orion sorry grog  travis i live for one thing  ashley am i close enough to get out of the boat  matt yeah you can get out of the boat  laura are you alive liam im alive  matt keyleth youre left out there as a shark as everyone goes inside  /none/ laura i go look at the treasure chest sam im going too  liam good job badasses  marisha ill stay with the boat  taliesin all right that was fine  ashley i didnt even need to get out of the boat  you guys just handled it like that  taliesin ill go back to the boat then its fine i dont care  orion im sorry percy listen im sorry everybody  i didnt mean to kill everybody  so quickly  ill let you kill everybody next time  percy  matt vex you go over /none/ and lift the top of the chest  which was unlocked previously by your brother  as you lift it up for a split second  you see what looks like a flash of orange energy a very familiar one  as suddenly a secondary fire blast explosion sound  emanates from the treasure chest itself  laura i thought you checked for traps liam i didnt do nothing  others laugh  matt the blast radius sends the top half of the chest  careening off and scraping off the roof of the cavern  you guys who just /none/ turned the corner see this giant explosion  sending you about 20 feet backwards  laura awesome good thing you didnt get there in time scanlan  liam is that chest ten feet away from me as well  matt yeah so a reflex saving throw for both of you  laura okay cool liam i have a thing i can do too  laura whats reflex is that dexterity  matt or dexterity sorry singsong carry over from pathfinder  i meant dexterity  laura 30 matt 30 jesus christ  liam this is a dexterity check  matt /none/ yeah liam 20  matt you both manage to find a way to dodge most of the impact  but you still both take 14 points of fire damage  liam as a rogue with evasion if i succeed its nothing  matt then you take nothing  laura as a twin of a rogue  matt you take 14 points of fire damage  laura can i have your thingy liam my thingy  laura your eraser thingy liam i dont know where it is  laura oh thanks ashley youre welcome  matt the familiar whine of the /none/ trap catches your ear  you dodge out of the way instinctively your sisters not so lucky  you take the brunt of the damage but not the full damage  laura oh no did i destroy the loot  matt if you want to inspect what the chest once was  as you go back to where the chest was most of the chest is destroyed  its knocked off its hinge  what you do find inside though is what looks like a very very  there we go  what looks like a slightlycharred twohanded blade  /none/ a giant sword that is currently laid inside  looks like its been there a while in storage  there was a set of natural armor  thats been completely destroyed by the blast  laura aw come on  matt there are a number of coins in there  theres probably a good hefty pile of gold  slightly molded by the moisture  thats been kept inside this chest until it was detonated  gathering it up you find  approximately 420 gold pieces  sam yeah 420  liam whats that mean is that a reference what /none/ is that  matt but for everything that was damaged inside the chest  the sword which would be considered a greatsword  seems to be largely unaffected by the blast  other than a little bit of soot that you had to rub off the blade  laura ill take it to grog  because i figure  hell probably be able to use it  matt there you go she hands you this fantastic sword  laura i dont know if its magic or anything grog  so you might want to have tiberius have a look at /none/ it  travis hold on let me check i take it and i shake it really hard  orion thats not how you really  travis i think i know what im doing all right here you can check it  orion as hes doing that i get 18 trying to see whats up  matt okay theres definitely a magical aura emanating from the blade  you take a moment to inspect it and you ascertain the magical nature  orion what you have there is a greatsword of frenzy grog  you have a 1 bonus to attack /none/ and damage rolls  made with this magic weapon  ooh when you attack a creature with this magic weapon  and roll a 20 on the attack roll after dealing damage  you can immediately make an additional attack for free  travis glad i shook it  laura pass that piece of paper over here  sam maybe scanlan could use it  matt scanlan could its a little big for you  youd be at quite a disadvantage using this weapon  travis give it over here a greatsword of frenzy  sam id like to rage /none/ frenzy  are there any bodies that we can look at  matt you guys were inspecting  what remains  of three of the undead creatures  they have been turned to ash pretty much from the force of the explosion  the arcane nature of the detonation you find pieces of them  most of them have been charred and burned away from the bodies  who are already in partiallydecomposed form  the larger one that you had hunters marked though  upon inspecting it while most of its armor is destroyed  it does manage to /none/ carry a partiallymildewed coin purse  looking inside you only find  about five or six pieces of gold  but you do find one really  really nice  looks like its taken a little bit of damage  but it was once a really pretty diamond  laura im just going to keep this with the party gold  sam with the party treasury oh sure laura plus one diamond to the treasury  orion vex let me see the diamond for just one second  as hes shaking his sword  i go into the bag of /none/ holding and take out the mending wheel  laura did you turn it back into coal orion thats not how it works vex  matt tiberius you reach into the bag of holding  you pull out the mending wheel which is a magical artifact  that you found earlier in the campaign as part of your personal quest  it looks like a large spoked roulette wheel when its laying down  with these strange points that fold out of it  once you spin the wheel  you place an object in the center of the wheel  /none/ its lifted without gravity  and mends itself  back to its undamaged form  you place the diamond in the center and spin the wheel  you can see the actual cracks on the surface of it slowly begin to mend  eventually the diamond is brought to a solid undamaged  finelycut example of a diamond  laura whoa sparkles orion there you go  ashley its so pretty  sam what time of day matt you have no idea  sam how long has it been since we rested  matt it hasnt been too terribly long /dung/  you rested at the camp after taking out queen ulara  so id say its probably been about with the travel to get to this point  probably about six hours  since you rested  travis plus nobody is hurt laura well hes hurt  travis well im not hurt  laura can i perception check around the cave  matt go ahead and roll perception  sam can i remind our party of a couple things  pike might be a good time to try to heal vaxs foot again  and also while we have a /none/ moment  did we ever discern what is in that yellow vial  orion oh this thing sam yeah do we know what this is  orion ill do an arcana check on the vial which is not great  i dont know it looks icky  sam let me take a look as well ooh yes 24  matt you take a look at the liquid and it looks enchanted  but the way its mixture is  the colors seem to swirl and shift in a very caustic way  you can see from glancing at the glass /none/ vial its contained in  the interior of the glass looks slightly pockmarked  almost like the viscous fluid within has actually damaged the glass slightly  sam it sounds bad bad news  matt youre unable to really ascertain what the nature of the liquid is  but those are the details you can make out currently  ashley i went over to vaxs foot again  laura oh no come on dont  all laugh  sam theres a little zombie poo on it  laura im getting real tired  of your shit  liam ever since /dung/ we were five  laura i rolled 22 on perception  by the way  matt all right make a medicine check  orion does this cave bottleneck  matt it ends here this is the end of the cave  it curved around and ended in this little portion here  so you had a perception check what did you roll  laura 22 matt 22  laura yes yes yes sam oh snap  marisha secrets travis the second whisper  sam get down into frame lower into frame pull them down  orion pull them down  /none/ sam ladies and gentlemen  we have a bunch of shirts to sell tonight  laura quietly i think maybe liam you look weird whats up  laura we should not be hanging out in this room right now  can i try to get a better look at what i saw  matt you see best you can and you guys follow her eyeline  you look up and you see  what first looks like its part of the cavern ceiling  it has this weird texture it looks almost like the smooth rock  that the interior /none/ of the cavern comes off as  however as you see it shift and move  it looks almost like a portion of it is moving and slowly crawling  and it looks like theres a red gleaming eye and then two  and something drops down from the side  almost like a tail that seems to dangle for a second  at which point it detaches  fwoosh opens up almost like a giant ray  with a screeching mouth that screeches screams at you  it lands down in the center of the room  ashley i /none/ rolled a nine for medicine just btw  all laugh  liam hows my foot doing these days  matt your foot is still healing but unfortunately  based on the medicine roll it is getting better  but not enough to complete the process of you getting all your toes back  ashley i saw that thing out of the corner of my eye  and was just distracted  orion you guys want to run sam oh what is that thing  laura its a big ray of death i dont know  liam it does look like /dung/ a flying manta ray  matt lets roll some initiative folks  laura ugh ashley ugh come on  sam get out of this cave liam cheeky bastard  ashley oh really really i just rolled a natural 20  why couldnt i get that for medicine  matt thats how it works  marisha just throwing it out there still the shark with the boat  laura ugh double 20s on the table  liam natural 20  marisha if you guys want to run the keys are in the car  the engines warmed up ready to go /none/ ive got the key turned on  its nice and cozy  thats such a good roll though thats a good initiative roll  matt so at this  this thing leaps out from almost nowhere  the only reason you picked it up is your acute vision and as it lands  its right around the corner from the two of you  and it has this long almost spined tail  and this jaw that opens up this nasty toothy gaping maw  all right initiative rolls of 25 to 20  taliesin 22 matt 22  travis /none/ 21 liam 25  matt 25 all right travis and the shark  marisha 20  ashley 20 matt nice all right  matt what were you  taliesin 22 travis plus ashs was natural 20  matt and grog what was yours again  travis 21 matt all right  matt 20 to 15  orion 18 matt 18 for tiberius 15 to ten  sam 11 matt 11 for scanlan  laura ten matt ten  ashley sorry scanlan  sam its all right ill see you next match  marisha were all over ten though  thats /none/ pretty good guys we should be proud of that  matt all right so top of the round as this creature sits there  its giving off this weird horrible moaning sound  screeches  thats starting  to just fill your ears  at the top of the round is vax  laura what should we do command us  liam command us  laura do you want us to stay  liam run  all laugh  liam weve never done it before  laura weve never run travis lets see what happens  liam what the hell /none/ is it called my quick action to dash  laura just leaving me liam yeah  laura youre leaving me behind  liam can i grab her by the scruff  and run  matt if you want to try and move her youll basically move both of you  you can do that but youll have no other action  liam thats what i want to do matt okay  liam grabbing my sister  matt grab your sister  orion get on the damn carpet you fools  laura groaning can it fit us  matt currently you /none/ guys would be able to get onto the carpet  laura we jump onto the carpet  ashley what if he flies laura he probably does  matt what  why would a giant wingedthing fly  ashley laughs he looks like he flies guys  sam wait can we have an aerial battle  over water lets do it  matt percy taliesin im on the boat  matt no youre not on the boat  you guys have come into the cavern after this point when you gave chase  you guys are in the cavern  taliesin /none/ i started heading back to the boat  matt oh you did then yeah youre still out by the boat  taliesin so i just heard someone yell run  so im going to start unhooking the boat im getting the boat ready to go  matt you take the butt of your gun  and you start bashing against the ice that you set against the wall it cracks  and eventually you get the rope free from the side of the wall  taliesin and im bringing the boat around so that people can get on really quick /none/  matt okay that brings us to grog  travis i would like to rage and run  all laugh  travis passing as many people as i can  matt all right  travis rage running frantic noises  matt okay so you just bolt out i say rage run and barbarian speed  youre going to get nearly completely out of the cavern  liam his knees  are really high in the air  matt keyleth are you staying out in shark form at the boat  marisha yeah i guess  i feel percy unhook  /none/ and i start the forward momentum  pointing that direction  matt okay all right pike  ashley oh wow im up so soon okay im going to start running  matt all right so you turn and run you catch up to grog  because he traveled twice the distance that you could have  with your tiny little gnome legs in your fullplate armor  youre like grunt  plus its sand so your feet are sinking with each step  its rough for you to get around because of your size and the terrain  ashley can /none/ i jump on his leg or back  matt you can try to  ashley all right  matt all right  make an athletics check  with disadvantage because youre in fullplate armor  liam nothings free laughing youve got to roll for everything  ashley all right we got a 19 and we got a nine  matt all right whats your strength what was your athletics total  ashley my athletics is a one total  matt so that brings you to a ten ten is what you needed  so as you run up you leap /none/ and grab onto grogs back  grog i want you to make a  ashley wait no hold on i need to be honest i rolled an eight  my athletics is a one so doesnt that make me nine  matt that makes you a nine  ashley sorry  travis look at that honor code  laura that was good because i was going to let it go  matt so as you jump to grab onto the back of grogs back  you manage to find purchase  grog instinctually reaches back with an elbow  and /none/ hits you right in the side of the armor  which knocks you flat on your back  youre currently prone in the sand right there  and grog just keeps running  you glance over your shoulder for a second but because youre raging  you dont see her you just see shadows in the cavern  travis screaming in panic  matt so you start moving your hand in the air freaking out  holding your axe in one hand and your greatsword in the other  just panicked screaming  ashley laughing oh my god thats hilarious /none/  travis whack boom oh my god  ashley thats all right im tough  matt the large raylike  cloaked creature  swoops down towards the top of the  ashley oh shoot weve got to get out of here  travis laughing sorry  liam its a good thing we ran laura oh yeah does it even matter  laura no its just going to attack us liam we just gave up a turn  matt all right its going to make  a bite attack against tiberius  and a tail attack against scanlan  so its /none/ the two that are immediately visible to it  so the bite attack against you tiberius thats going to be a 21  orion yeah that hits  matt the bite attack against you is going to be a 23  all laugh  matt the tail whapsh whips around as youre on top of the carpet  about to try to get everyone out of there  you turn around and see this thing go piercing by  it strikes across your chest  your armor takes most of the damage but you can feel the bruise underneath  /none/ it doesnt actually pierce the skin  but you take seven points of damage from the impact of the tail  matt tiberius orion yes  matt all right it comes out and sinks its teeth into your form  across your shoulder area and it bites down you end up taking  orion youre ruining my robe grunts  matt laughing ten points of piercing damage  marisha oh no liam squishing noise  matt and the creature wraps around you squelch completely envelops you  sam him or me or both matt him  matt it completely surrounds /dung/ you and wraps you like a blanket  all of a sudden your vision goes dark you feel yourself like muffled yelling  youre unable to really move you are blind and unable to breathe  the air is not able to get to you at this time  travis shit liam it is poppycock  matt so thats going to end its turn tiberius your turn  orion well grunts fire breath  matt okay laura oh thats good  orion roaring get off of me  matt because its attached to your head its going to have disadvantage /none/  so i think its is it a dexterity saving throw  its head is right by your mouth  go ahead and roll damage  i rolled a natural 20 and a six  so because of the disadvantage it does not make its save  orion so wisdom liam d6 times something i think  matt yeah roll the damage for your fire breath  orion how many d6 liam depends on your level  matt depends on your level as a dragonborn  orion oh hang on matt should be on your sheet  orion is it /none/ no matt no no its here ill  matt no its part of the dragonborn ability  let me pull it up real fast  orion i dont want to roll wrong i think its 2d6  liam thats for a low level  laura you know nothing here travis your powers are worthless  sam if only there was a way  taliesin if there was some book  that had all  this information available  matt it is 3d6 at 6th level  orion oh awesome cool  taliesin some ancient tome which suddenly answers everything  /none/ orion panting in relief 21  matt 21 points of damage you all hear a muffled explosion sound  as bits of flame begin to shoot out  from the corners  of where its wrapping around the torso of tiberius  surrounding his head  the creatures tail flicks around in pain  you hear this muffled screeching sound as it keeps still tight around his head  fighting through the damage and maintaining its hold on him  orion if i do something ill probably have disadvantage  right correct well ill just try it again  ill /none/ spend fuck jeez no  laura dont spend all your sorcerers points  orion no i fly around and ping hit one of my stones  and ill spend  five sorcerer points to cast telekinesis  and blast sound fling it off me  matt okay all right  were going to do a contested roll on this  liam its a contest its like an arm wrestle  its like arm wrestling with dice  orion oh yeah arcana  matt well no  for this i believe its the roll plus your spell modifier  should be /none/ five so roll a d20 add five to it  orion 20  matt 20 all right  so your ioun stone is floating around your head  which is currently surrounded by the creature  its clinging to your head  you can feel it grinding into the top of your skull  you instill the ioun stone to trigger  as you do the force begins to pull it grunt off of  and flings it off of your head  the creature is detached and thrown back at that point of the wall off of you  /none/ orion grunts good  i use my movement to get the hell out of there grunts  matt all right they move out that way  marisha trinket run  laura its not my turn yet tell him to go  matt scanlan are you staying on the carpet  anything else you want to do  sam i am staying on the carpet wait is pike off the carpet  ashley im laying in the dirt matt pikes laying in the dirt right now  sam okay i will jump off the carpet grab her and say  pike /none/ come with me  if you want to live  all laugh  sam and i just hold her really tight  and i sniff her hair and it smells like strawberries  taliesin got to make it weird man ashley laughs  sam and then i dimension door us to the boat  marisha aw thats cute  matt as scanlan grabs you and holds you for a second  for a moment youre confused  and you hear that strange shrieking moan in the distance  and suddenly the darkness gives way to this flash of purple arcane /none/ energy  and the two of you boof fall a few inches into hard wood  and you feel the boat rock  for a second  as youre now  on the outside in the boat  being tugged by keyleth the shark  ashley scanlan thanks  sam dont worry that hard wood is the boat  all laugh  travis i have to applaud  matt okay vex  laura trinket run  matt bear moan trinket runs up are you staying on the carpet  laura i jump off the carpet climb on trinket and we /none/ take off  matt all right  you jump on top of your bear and you start bolting down the hallway  all right that ends your turn clarota just whoosh vanishes  kima laughing goes running on her halfling legs  towards the flying carpet  she takes her full turn and she just manages  to get on top of the carpet and thats her turn  and she goes go go go go  orion i am going  matt laughing all right so for the time being  well say you guys manage to whoosh make /none/ your way  outside of the cavern to the ship  sam for now taliesin up up up  laura can you go oh youre a shark  matt being towed  laura damn it taliesin were fine  laura wonder how far this thing can fly  travis well well find out real quick  taliesin we have lots of ways to hurt it before it gets there  we have arrows and guns were fine  matt as you guys all get into the boat  marisha laughing follow the macys day balloon shark  sam shushing this /none/ is the craziest thing ever  matt as keyleth begins to pull away the boat picks up speed into the water  and you hear that moan sound begin to get louder  as the creature swoosh out of the cavern giving chase  taliesin i take a shot  matt all right so for the purposes of this  taliesin youve been waiting to use this sam this is a james bond water chase  all laugh  matt all right so going off same top of the round  vax youre up first  liam okay so i /none/ throw a dagger at the mcray there  matt due to its distance the darkness behind it  and the fact that you are in a boat  you are at a disadvantage on both your attack rolls  liam plus i had a one on the first one  matt so you super miss on that one  liam no it was a seven plus  13 on the second  matt okay so you throw both daggers whoosh whoosh  unfortunately its hard to make the form of the creature  it seems to almost i cant say /none/ change its color  but it embraces the shadows around it and it gets harder and harder to see  and for a moment you swear  you see two more appear at its sides  liam oh mirror images sam oh no  matt you fling both daggers and they vanish into the darkness  and return to your side that ends your turn  percy youre up  taliesin all right  im going to take a deadeye sharpshooter shot  im going hardcore with this  so with bad news im sitting down  matt so youve /none/ leaned your giant sniper cannon  that youve constructed up against the side of the boat  aim it up best you can and take a shot  you are at disadvantage for this shot  taliesin im at advantage for this shot  matt so it cancels out its just a regular shot  taliesin regular shot liam come on  taliesin 13 liam beautiful human  matt 13 taliesin yeah  matt 13 unfortunately misses taliesin damn it  matt gun blast sound  the ship actually rocks from the impact of the explosion  for a second /none/ there you all feel like  its going to list and take on water  laura are we all on the boat or are some people still on the carpet  orion no a bunch of people are on the carpet  matt whos on the carpet still travis were in the boat  laura we didnt all fit in the boat  thats why we didnt all take the boat originally  orion im still on the carpet  matt okay tiberius is still on the carpet  laura youre the only one still on the carpet then  /none/ travis like i said  taliesin by the way if anyone wants to make us  a little sixsquare carpet that would be awesome  marisha if someone crocheted us a little singlesquare magic carpet  orion thatd be so fun  marisha so we could put it on our little floaty deal  taliesin and i reload  matt so you go ahead and reload yeah thatll be your turn  that comes up to grog  travis how close is manta ray  matt the creature is approximately  40ish feet away at an angle  so its /none/ about 50 feet away from you up in the air  laura how long is that chain on the axe  travis i was going to do something else  matt you can try and shift your weight to the back of the boat  and get closer with your movement if you want  travis i dont think the chains long enough 50 feet long  is the chain of returning long enough to get to him  matt you can certainly try  travis laughing im going to hold off  i would like to hold off and /none/ maybe hell come closer  since i seem to be an intimate sort of fellow  matt all right cool keyleth youre pulling the boat  marisha im going to use a run action just double speed  i feel action above and im just shark instincts  matt okay so you manage to get some distance for the ship  pulling it further behind  marisha yeah  i have a swim speed of 40  matt youre moving slower than that because youre pulling it  towing the entire boat behind you so youre going 20  but /none/ youre putting distance  between you and the creature  for the rest of the party  which makes it harder  for it to catch up  all right that brings us to pike  ashley okay  im going to send a guiding bolt  to the flying manta ray  so i have to roll and see if it hits  matt yes add your spell modifier to it oh you found your sheet  ashley yeah i did matt awesome  ashley it doesnt hit its 12  matt 12 does not hit unfortunately  once /none/ again you fire and you think you hit one of them  but it seems to hit one  of the group of three  thats now flying overhead  and one shimmers and vanishes seemingly unaffected by the bolt  but that one image of it disappears  ashley can i do anything else since im just sitting  matt no not unless you want to move somewhere in the boat  ashley no dang it  matt all right its now its turn it is going to move  it gains up on the boat to about there /none/  it actually gets a little lower  its starting to gain on you guys  make its way shh gliding down towards the front  and you see now theres now two of them side by side  that are coming down towards you guys  sam are those real laura i dont know  matt its then that that strange moaning sound its making  moans begins to grow louder and louder  and all of you close your ears for a second  everybody make a wisdom saving throw  marisha including me  matt you dont /none/ actually hear in the water youre muffled  marisha im in the water yeah  matt its to the point where it doesnt actually affect you  plus youre in shark form  orion oh crap wisdom matt yes  orion aw sam laughs  matt all right scanlan  sam i rolled a two but my wisdom is negative two  all laugh  sam so im at a zero matt all right tiberius  orion i rolled a four matt four percy  taliesin one  matt one oh no grog laura oh no our whole party  /none/ travis 13  ashley 12  laura 11  liam 14  sam oh boy taliesin we are killing it  matt grog and vex now lets see you rolled a what  laura i rolled an 11  matt 11 okay yeah so no vax however is okay  so kima vax and grog and clarota all hear this horrible moaning sound  and plug their ears and shake it off not a problem everyone else  sam instant peril  matt this creature all of a sudden its form becomes far more frightening  than you ever saw /none/ before it almost seems to swell with the cavern  orion is it casting a spell  matt its a natural ability all of you are considered frightened  orion oh my lord  sam is it charming us  matt nope it is not a charm effect it is a fear effect  you are scared of it currently  laura trinket is immune to being scared  it doesnt matter  because im scared  matt youre scared trinkets not affected but you are  essentially until the end of its next turn  its disadvantage on all /none/ attack rolls and you cannot move closer to it  travis can i take that turn now  matt you can take that turn now yeah as its moaning  travis now since i shook it off im like thats lovely  and i would like to try for the first time intimidating presence  sam is that a spell  travis on a creature within 30 feet  matt it would be within 30 feet turn around  ashley get it  laura get it grog get it  travis yells  all laugh  matt all right so /none/ whats the dc on that travis 13  matt 13 for what kind of saving throw travis wisdom saving throw  matt okay for the creature wisdom saving throw  it rolls a 12  all cheer  matt so after it does this moaning sound  that sends the entire boat shaking with fear  everyone grasping the side of the boat  looking at each other like were going to die  grog turns around steps forward  pushing pike and scanlan to the side a little bit  and just glares at this creature  gives a /none/ giant bestial goliath shout roars out into the cavern  that counteracts the moan that its doing  you can see the creature teeth bared its wings out  looking extremely frightening looks visibly shaken  it begins to flap backwards and actually get about 30 feet of distance  between you guys instinctually with its movement  travis thats right bitch  hes frightened until the end of the next turn  laura does that cancel out our fear  matt it doesnt cancel out yours  it just means its further away and cant get closer to grog /dung/  sam but were still scared of it  matt youre still scared of it until the end of its next turn  but now its keeping its distance from the boat  it was starting to catch up to you guys and now its actually pulled back  not wanting to get near grog all right tiberius  orion whats the creature made out of whats his skin like when i look at him  matt it looks leathery  it has almost the texture of a very very thick bat or lizard skin  but its very dark /none/ from what you can see  youve had just little glimpses of it here and there  most of its been shrouded in shadow  its almost like a thick leather cloak thats come to life  orion well i dont really  hey what do you think i should do guys  all laugh  travis knock it into the water let the shark have at it  sam can you make us faster can you haste her or anything  orion haste doesnt work that way now  laura how high are the ceilings can you pillars it /none/ down into the water  sam just defer  orion ill defer for now  matt okay so tiberius you move your movement to later  liam we cant sail away  sam can you shake us can you shake our magic fear  matt not unless you have an antifear spell  scanlan youre up  sam im going to attack at disadvantage i guess with  im going to create a big hand right in front of him  to stall him with the bigbys hand  ashley talk to the hand matt all right  travis bigbys /none/ hand orion bigby hand nice  sam its this guy i know his names bigby he has a big hand  matt all right so you take your turn are you just using the which one  sam im going to grapple and try to get it into the water  matt oh grasping hand ashley ooh  matt okay all right  attempt to grapple  use the hands strength score to resolve the grapple  sam what do i do what do i roll  matt strength of 26 so roll d20  8  marisha come on /none/  sam i dont know what that is is that a six or a nine  laura there should be a dot on one side  sam its a nine  matt okay so nine plus eight  youre at 17  its contest was at 15 oh but you are at disadvantage  so roll again  marisha oh come on laura dont be lower  sam 14 yeah im good  matt okay so as you rear back your eyes squinting  just scared to even do anything with this creature  you try out this new spell /none/  that youve only just recently managed to conjure to your attention  sam singing talk to the hand  matt as scanlan finishes singing  the rippling sonic energy from his singing  shoots out from in front of him and forms this giant  slightly ethereallooking  arcane fist the size of the creature  that reaches out  grabs onto it as hes moving his hand  controlling it silently from a distance  it grapples the creature holds it in place  as its wings are also folded on itself and you pull down  lets /none/ see here grasping hand all right so you are trying to  sam well i dont know  does it fall from gravity or does it just it stay there locked in  matt its locked in where youre holding it  sam okay then ill just lock it there  matt okay so you lock it there great you can use a bonus action to crush it  sam oh yeah i can crush it  yeah i also give it a little squeeze a little tickle  matt so as youre holding it in place you use your /none/ bonus action to squeeze it  it takes 2d6  5 bludgeoning damage  sam 11 plus five 16  matt 16 nice  as it is currently held in place screeching screech crunch  you hear this strange crushing sound  of bones breaking on the inside of its strange form  sam this is the strongest ive ever been  all laugh  matt all right and it is considered grappled  which is bad for a creature like that  that ends scanlans turn vex  laura hunters mark  matt all right you hunters mark the /none/ creature  laura and im going to attack him twice because im original  travis i have one thing i do  laura 16  matt 16 does hit  laura and 28  matt all right technically because its grappled  liam does it cancel out the disadvantage  matt it does not technically it just means he can move it  so yeah it does not cancel out the disadvantage  laura oh so ive got to roll a couple more times  matt yeah  laura they both hit theyre both high  matt okay great there /dung/ you go  so as youre on the boat you can see the hand grasping  it gives you a moment of bravery  you pull out swoosh swoosh let loose two more arrows  into the slightly dark shrouded exterior of the boat  both arrows strike true  into the currentlygrappled cloaklike creature  laura 26 for those two plus hunters mark  oh wait no 30 for those two  and 9 for hunters mark  matt nice portions of it are trying  to squeeze free of this arcane hand  one strikes through its wing /none/ leaving a gaping wound in the middle  where you can see  its going to have a hard time maintaining height at this point  the second one strikes it  and actually pierces  one of its red glowing eyes  it gives out this horrible  painful screeching sound screech  into the cavern  as you can now see what was once two gleaming red piercing eyes  left with only one  and darkness on the other side of its face  travis yes yes ashley ooh  matt that brings us  to kima /none/ and clarota  kima at this point in time is unfortunately at a disadvantage  of finding out what to do at this distance being a paladin  she is going to attempt  travis the middle finger  matt nothing shes going to wait it out  orion i see what happens  matt so youre taking your turn after laura  orion yes ill follow suit  im going to  im going to straightup cast this because i have to  i cast telekinesis and i pull the eye out sucking noise  laura ew travis kill /none/ billstyle right  matt interesting okay  so clarota at this time  is also going to attempt a mind blast on the creature  it moves to the back of the boat  and while its currently grappled hes going to attempt that  the saving throw does succeed so it only takes half damage  okay marking that  and then as you do telekinesis roll a d20 plus five  orion okay and do i have advantage because of the grapple  matt the grapple does not give you advantage no  so you have disadvantage on /none/ the roll technically  because you are scared of it  orion and thats my what matt plus five  orion 17  matt 17 all right so as you focus your energy once again  even just facing this creature is a terrifying thing  you see that one gleaming bit of red thats piercing through the darkness  the secondary form around it dissipates  where there was once two gliding one of them vanishes entirely  as that gleaming red is suddenly much brighter  yanked from its socket  it now gives out another painful screech /none/ screeches  as it is blinded being crushed by a bigby hand  and you now have drifting amongst you at your control  one of the eyes of this creature  all laugh  laura put it in a little vial keep it for later  orion im going to float it over and put it in one of my vials  matt okay write down in your inventory cloaker eye  orion im going to smell it first of all  orion no laura not good  taliesin you know exactly where thats been  matt this guys /dung/ not having a good day vax youre up  liam all right dagger dagger thunk thunk  but at disadvantage because of the dark im not afraid  matt well no you resisted the fear you have low light so youre fine  liam okay first one is 26 matt hits  liam second one is 26  matt hits because it is blinded you do have advantage on it  not advantage you are able to sneak attack  liam sneak attack all right okay  matt its currently held aloft grappled by the hand  it has no /none/ visual sight currently  sam ive no idea what were even fighting  liam 23  matt all right how do you want to do this  marisha cheers  liam i saw where tiberius pulled the eye out  and thats what im aiming at its eye socket  so i flip it in the air and when i catch it  i immediately let go and fill in the blank  matt okay sam socket to me  matt so as the creature is flailing about in torturous pain  suddenly the dagger fwoosh thunk  sinks into /none/ the empty socket in the front of its face  as it does its body tenses up and reaches out  against the force of your arcane hand  you actually have to focus to keep it in place  in its final death throes  all of its tension and then it falls limp within your grasp  you now have this limp creature at your disposal  sam oh im going to bring him to the boat  matt as scanlan slowly drifts over the limp body of this creature  to the edge of the boat  /none/ laura what was it can we loot him  all laugh  laura does he have teeth and scales and neat things  liam its a cloaker because that was a cloakers eye  taliesin can we fashion it into a sail  sam thats a good idea  matt there is no wind in this tunnel  marisha i can make one  sam taliesin and laura we can make wind  ashley we do have an air ashari laura we have a grog  travis oh we can make wind taliesin grog will make wind  orion i /none/ rolled a 16 for a history check on the creature  matt historys not going to do much for you  nature is what youre going to want to do  nature or arcana those are the two  orion so thats 14 oh no arcana matt roll for arcana  orion yeah 25  matt yep this creature is a cloaker its an aberration  its one of those creatures that drifts over from the far realm  or at some point in time drifted over from the far realm  and is an unnatural entity to this plane /none/ they normally live subterranean  when not moving they are nearly invisible and blend in  almost like a straight leather cloak left and discarded to the side  hence the name cloaker  taliesin ive got a great idea  i want to sit and i want to skin this thing  orion well yes i want the teeth also  taliesin you can have the teeth im going to skin it  matt okay so you guys are now currently in this boat  drifting along in the open area over on that side  laura should we /town/ make our way to the little island  taliesin or we could go to those strange buildings  that are off in the northwest corner  laura all the way up and over  marisha oh well i was going to say we could go into this cave here  sam maybe move it this way so the people can see  laura oh yeah its right on the edge  taliesin keep going there you go  marisha well what about this cave  laura the only thing is  im afraid that if we keep using up all /dung/ our spells  then we wont be able to take down the big baddie if we come to him  marisha we need a rest laura and ashley we need rest  marisha i want to be able to use my scrying spell  before we try anything  laura oh okay so should we make our way to this cave  marisha sure travis good well do that  orion how close are we how long will that take  matt if you guys start heading that direction youll find out  taliesin lets start heading that direction  /none/ and i want to skin this creature  matt okay as you guys are moving along you leave a little space for percy  its a little unwieldy in the ship  its hard for you to do this so its not going to be the best job  taliesin not going for craftsmanship  matt fair enough as youre plucking what you think might be interesting  from this creatures body as in the process of skinning it  you probably take a moment to realize that a normal blade  is going to have a hard time cutting /none/ through its hide  so you might have to borrow one  sam i sing a little song to inspire him  i sing when youre trying  to skin a cloaker  heres some inspiration  when were on a creepy boat heres some inspiration  i want you to be near me speaking all right thats it  all laugh  matt right so you gain a d10 inspiration dice  taliesin im making a camo canopy for the boat  matt yeah this is going to be a survival check on this roll survival  orion i /none/ rolled a natural 20 to help him with any arcana enchantment  if he succceeds  taliesin 17  matt 17 did you add the inspiration dice to that  taliesin i didnt  matt you dont have to if you dont want to  taliesin im keeping it for later matt okay  sam no it only lasts ten minutes  taliesin oh does it only last ten minutes  orion a lot can happen in ten minutes  taliesin oh in that case 26  matt 26 would make a difference in the confined space on this ship /none/  as you guys crest around towards the northern side of that island  you begin to move around you can see to the right of you  there is this tunnel that filters out the side of this cavern  thats just a continuation of the water a river on the far end  you dont know where it goes it disappears in the darkness  and you can hear in the distance the light sound of rushing water  marisha can i use my shark eyes to look down the tunnel  matt it begins to curve about /none/ 20 feet in  so youre unable to make much past that distance  and it looks like a continuation of the water flowing through or into  youre not quite able to tell from this distance  taliesin singing nobody knows what its like  taliesin and marisha singing to be a shark man  matt orion and sam laugh  matt percy you manage to pull from it all the teeth in the process  taliesin for you  matt so that comes to roughly 45 cloaker teeth  you dont know what thatll be worth but you /none/ have that at your disposal  so you can write down 45 cloaker teeth  you manage to skin most of it  you get most of the top of its hide  usable its still wet  itll take a while to do that  let alone in an area where its dry on the surface  but you manage to pull most of the top of it off  so you have this wet skinned portion of the back of the cloaker  at your disposal  taliesin im going to build a relative canopy  specifically for /none/ the left side of the boat  so that were protected  and visibly obscured from anybody in the city  matt okay make a tinker check  taliesin whats the bonus on that again  matt well for that it should be dex i believe  taliesin dex thank you raspberry noise  matt plus four because youre proficient with it  so its your dex plus your proficiency modifier  taliesin thats 11  matt 11  taliesin i rolled really badly  matt yeah you did you still have the hide  in the time it takes /none/ for you to get to the beach  you dont have much material at your disposal  and to fashion anything thats on that side  the most you manage to get is a slight lift to it  and by the time you get to the beach it just collapses on itself  taliesin okay once were at the beach and we have all evening  ill make another attempt  matt okay itll take you some time its doable but itll take a while  taliesin i had a two ashley its okay  travis we made our /dung/ way to the beach  matt as you make your way towards the beach  keyleth you see in the distance in the water what looks like  something slinking on the very bottom of this underground lake  probably a good 50 60 feet down  you can barely make out what looks like a dark form  probably about 100 to 150 feet away and its only because of your shark form  that youre able to make out any sort of semblance of it  but it looks big  and it looks like its slowly moving /dung/ through the bottom of the lake  doesnt seem to be moving towards you  orion its just a thing theres going to be things here  sam what if its just like one of those party cruises where they  travis on the bottom of the  taliesin submersive party cruise  laura how close are we to the cave are we still really far away  matt you guys are maybe 300 feet from the beach  sam but we dont see it because were on deck right  matt the creature no only keyleth does  marisha /dung/ i drop them off at the beach  taliesin lets drydock the boat  matt okay im going to ask keyleth to make a stealth check in shark form  taliesin a shark stealth stealth shark  matt the dex bonus of a shark form  is zero so just roll a d20  marisha thats not true its 1  matt giant shark according to here it says one its a zero dex is 11  marisha oh i was looking at mine sam shark argument  marisha its okay 17  matt 17 okay  as you deftly /none/ drag the boat at just the right distance  to curve around  this large subterranean form  it doesnt seem to take notice and eventually drifts far enough away  where you can no longer make any sort  of visual connection with its form  you make your way to the side of the beach  you drag up to the point where the ship begins to hit the gravel  you begin to move curve to the side and it grinding sound lifts up  and comes to a rest at the top of the gravel beach /none/  you guys all step off the boat  okay grog you go ahead and haul the boat up  laura im going to cast  pass without a trace  on all of us right now  matt okay  marisha i go ahead and unshark myself  matt okay  liam and im going to look for bad things on the beach  sam yeah whats the layout of the beach is it just a beach  matt okay so looking at the beach here its an open beach  you can see there are a few rock /none/ formations  small 15foottall portions of stalagmites or stone  that either have been here for a long time  or have been constructed or put there to jut out of that part of the beach  but for the most part its just an open gravel beach  that slowly comes to stop at the edge of the cavern  and there is a tunnel about 15 20 feet wide ahead of you  sam is there a halfsubmerged statue of liberty or anything  matt perception check  all laugh  sam i got a 16 for my /none/ perception  matt 16 you do not see any sort of halfsubmerged statue of liberty  my apologies  liam how far away are we from the main island  is it like dumbo to manhattan distance  matt yeah id say its probably about a good half a mile or so  travis i would like to perceive  if lady kima has been giving me any second looks  after i intimidated old flappy wings  matt make a perception check  travis ten plus probably nothing yeah nothing ten  matt its hard to tell  she /none/ seems very focused  on the task at hand  her eyes have been for the most part up in the air around you  unfortunately grog you dont think  shes paying much mind to you at the moment  because shes more concerned about keeping the group alive  and where you guys are currently headed  youll have to try harder to get her attentions  its okay grog  laura can we look around the entrance  and see if anything dangerous looks like its around  im looking up on the ceiling  matt yeah /dung/ now that you know the idea of what to look for for a cloaker  go ahead and make a perception check  liam 29  matt okay you guys glance around and  currently looking at the walls on the exterior of this beach area  nothing matches the description of what you saw in the previous cavern  for the time being  it looks relatively safe on this part of the beach  laura okay liam and theres caves  matt there is a singular cave on the far end  theres a slight outcropping and then /dung/ it leads into  that one 20footwide cavern that goes deeper in there  liam im going to creep up just to the edge of the cave  im not going to go in  is it a separate perception check for the inside of the cave as well  matt yes  liam all right  matt you want to make a stealth check one more time  stealth check first  liam stealth check is good its a 21 31  matt 31 okay so making your way up  you dodge from low on the side of /none/ the beach  jumping in front of these strange stone platforms  keeping in look for cover  you make your way up against the side of a wall  begin to glance inside make a perception check  liam and that is 19  matt 19 its pitchblack in the cavern you have no light source unfortunately  you have darkvision which does help you to a certain extent  you cannot see the entirety of the cavern  but you can see about lets say 40 to 60 feet in  the beach gravel comes to a halt /dung/  and comes to this smooth stone flooring  you dont see anything that particularly catches your attention  liam manufactured or made or just paved floor  matt it looks like it has some natural change in the topography  its not a polished floor  but its definitely been worn over time  laura can we maybe try to look in orion could be a tide cave  travis we have firewood bundles  and stuff  marisha im wet that was a really cold lake  orion prestidigitation now youre all dry  liam its very hard /dung/ to know though its dark in there  laura should we just light it up see whats in there  taliesin lets light it up see what happens  laura hey tiberius  orion yes oh light  laura i shoot the arrow  matt okay so as you cast light on the arrow its blinding  you know at this point to close that one eye  as you release it in the distance  laura oh wait wrong eye  matt there you go thats the one  laura right right  matt you fire the arrow into /dung/ the depth of this cavern  before the light spell wears off it arcs inward  and it hits the back wall and ricochets off  looking inside it all looks like a natural cavern interior  the light is the same glowing white light that youre used to  once it enters the deep part of the cave  the light almost gets a purplish hue before its snuffed out  laura this doesnt seem very good  ashley wait the light gets a purplish hue  matt the white light becomes purple and then ffft is snuffed  /dung/ orion i want to do an arcana check 18  check for any nasty magic  matt at this distance its hard to make out any sort of source  you dont sense anything directly at your distance  youd probably have to get deeper in the cave  to make a true assessment of the magical source  laura oh you didnt add ten to your stealth pass without a trace  matt you have pass without a trace now too  laura well i already yeah  liam so my stealth was at a 41  matt okay /none/ good to know laughs  sam what do we do  weve got to get someones going in  travis want me to go in  sam yeah man go in others no  liam no if anyones going in send me im at a 41 stealth  and if we stay on the beach were in view of the main island  laura weve got to try to hide a little bit  ashley so the arrows not still lit it just went through  can you light tiberius  laura just get some light in there  can /none/ you put daylight in there  liam tiberius my dagger do the dagger  orion well sure but it means  that thing will be bright the whole time  liam i would lose stealth  orion yes you would  marisha pike can you check  ashley i have darkvision  matt yes as do a lot of you guys  ashley oh we all do  laura can you see if its evil  sam light a fire lets just light a fire and throw it in there  liam nonmagical travis we have torches  liam yeah /none/ throw a torch in  sam yeah lets just toss a torch  travis i pull one of the three torches we have  and tiberius will you  orion fire breath noise  travis i give it a nice long throw  matt all right tiberiuss flame breath fsssh coalesces  and begins to ignite the tip of the torch as grog lobs it in end over end  you see it hits the far end of the cavern  topples and hits the ground  the fire itself the bright red burning as it comes to rest  /dung/ takes on once again a strange purplish hue  liam do the halfelves and the gnomes see anything  when theres light going through  matt you see nothing in particular  you catch what looks almost like small whiffs  of almost a mist or a fog but its like ffft then vanish shh  laura i dont think  we should go in there  matt almost like theres this perpetually  materializing and dematerializing tufts of small clouds of smoke  liam forget this forget this cave keyleth can you do that thing you do  where /none/ you make the beach look like an empty beach  or something other than it is  can we camp on the beach instead of going in there  marisha i can  orion lets do that i agree im tired  marisha what if this is a clue or something important  sam yeah weve never shied away  from a confrontation before  orion pike can you sense if theres any nasties down there  ashley can i use dispel magic  matt you can attempt to yeah  ashley okay ill attempt  matt okay so pike /dung/ as you step up to the mouth of the cave  looking where the torchlight is you cast dispel magic  as you formulate your divine energy  grasping onto your symbol of sarenrae around your neck  you can see this strange pulsing shimmer of divine energy that clears out the area  the purplish hue to the light vanishes  and the light becomes  a natural torchlight for a moment  and all the wisps of smoke vanish  then slowly filter back into the space  travis we dont need to go in there  sam /none/ indeed if only we had someone who could go under the ground  and be one with the earth and pop up in there and look around no  laura but shell be popping up into the wisps  sam yeah but shell be fine  travis wall it up  laura i think just wall it up can we see anything sparkling  can we look in and see if theres anything that looks useful  travis yeah do i see any shapes and colors and sparkly things  ashley should we check for traps  matt its hard /none/ to tell you cant see  the entire cavern from this distance  because the cavern opens up and then curves around  theres a whole portion you cant see without entering it  liam heres what i think all right  we dont need to whack every problem over the head  and we have something far more important than whatevers in there  laura right lady kima  orion right i suggest we go and rest i believe we can get some respite  matt i think we have a specific goal at this point in time  /none/ and who knows what dangers or terrors roam these tunnels  aside from our specific directional choice at this moment  liam the only question is do we want to try to rest here  under some sort of illusion  or do we go to the island we can see  laura no because the islands way over back here  taliesin we rest here we take shifts we should be fine  liam we could sail there to the northwestern edge of the island  theres some sort of structure there  laura i think we rest up /none/ before we do that  marisha what if theres something in this cavern that could help us though  laura can you wall it up  travis between you and tiberius with the columns and stuff  marisha we could how about this  travis i dont need to rest so i can just stand guard  marisha how about i do what scanlan says  sam oh hello  taliesin that always works  marisha yes i know i think this is the first time ive said this ever  maybe ill try what scanlan says and ill turn /none/ into a rock elemental  and just bamf in there and see if theres anything good  and if its bad ill just run out and make a rock wall  sam oh okay  laura all right well all be ready to attack on the outside  marisha maybe okay travis go for it  taliesin yeah lets go for it this is a terrible plan  i think its a great idea  marisha lets do it i like it sam yeah lets send in one person  orion as soon as i see  her royalty go /dung/ in  matt all right you all gather yourself on the exterior of the cave  you get into defensive positions and prepare  liam can i ask one quick question before we go  regardless of what happens  if there is something shitty in here or not  are we camping here afterward  others yes  liam were sure okay then i click my boots of haste  matt all right  marisha im going to go ahead and cast enhance ability on myself  before i do that and give myself  extra wisdom  matt /none/ all right extra wisdom  marisha i want to be a perceptive bastard while im in there  matt so keyleth transforms herself into her earth elemental form  taliesin rah thats what rocks say  taliesin and marisha rah  sam im going to inspire her with a little dolphin dance or something  whatever that is i dont know im just going to  matt its hard to explain why  but his strange shimmy is slightly inspiring  youve learned something about yourself today  that you hope nobody else wants to bring up in conversation  /none/ you get a d10 inspiration dice  orion as soon as i see keyleth go off i rub my ring and go invisible  matt okay so as you guys all mount into your defensive positions  keyleth are you going straight through are you going beneath above  marisha burrow beneath  ill go deep voice byebye  matt this large earth elemental form takes a few lumbering steps forward  and begins to sink into the sand and gravel below  just shifting sound  marisha oh yeah wait have you guys seen this one  all laugh /none/  marisha as i go into the ground  matt the most awkward earth elemental exit ever  marisha ill take the elevator  travis i think its the funniest thing ive ever seen  all laugh  matt grogs loud laughter bellows echoing through the cavern  you make your way underneath the ground  using your tremor sense to formulate where the top of this cavern would be  and you poke your head through the floor  looking into this you can see now there are portions of this cavern  where it looks like elements of /none/ the mithril veins  that the subterranean kraghammer mines were currently pulling from  seem to now spread down into this cavern  there are small veins that trickle through the rock  in this cavern of mithril  you also look up and make a perception check  marisha with advantage right matt this is wisdom yep  marisha thats a 13 thats a 19 ill take that one  matt all right total of  marisha 29  matt 29 you take a moment and formulate your vision  the firelight still trickling through although you have darkvision /none/  you look about the room and you can see  there is a strange energy about the room  theres something about this room  that feels similar to when you encountered the frost plane  during the first westruun winters veil encounter  theres a type of energy that seems to be brought into being  whenever youve caught a mind flayer shifting and bamfing  out of any sort of combat you come into  theres something about this room that seems like its crossing over  or has a thin barrier  with some other plane /none/  liam its a gate  matt you dont see a particular doorway  but it feels like there is a very thin veil here  and as you focus more on the vicinity  you can see what looks like little bits of energy that leak through  that mist you were seeing seems to be elements  where the actual reality of this room is warping temporarily and shifting  ashley its like stargate  marisha can i take a piece of rock  and toss it up  matt you take it and you throw it up /none/ it arcs across  hits the other side of the room and clatters to the ground  as it clatters to the ground you suddenly see lightningquick  five of these large  fastmoving slithering weird creatures  that were up against the wall and now visible at this point  strike at the rock and seem to start fighting each other  for whatever that movement was  theyre large bluish and purple in color when it shifts in its form  with these sharp beaks  and what looks like four tentacles that wrap out from the face /none/  liam thats familiar sam maybe theyre friendly  matt make a nature check if you want no this would be arcana  arcana this wouldnt be nature  marisha arcana all right  taliesin youve got a number there  marisha ive got a vague number 11 matt okay  marisha wait plus four 15  matt arcana is intellect though its not wisdom is it  marisha i used scanlans die  matt oh you did oh i see 15 unable to really make out  more than youve heard of creatures like this  unlike most aberrations /none/ and creatures  that seem to bleed over from different planes of existence  this one is not an aberration in its form  this is just a subterranean monstrosity its known as a grick  marisha a grick  matt essentially it looks like that  all ew  sam show the people at home  travis i automatically dont like it  matt as they all take a moment and realize  that whatever they were fighting over is not living and not moving  they hiss at each other and slowly find other alcoves  and what /none/ you can now see are small caves that are dug into the rock nearby  something draws them to this room  as any natural space with this strange fluctuating energy would do so  marisha but theyre not necessarily bleeding through from the other plane  they come from this plane  matt it seems to be yeah theyre not too weird  theyre weird but theyre not too weird  marisha big worms with tentacles but not too weird  matt youve seen it all  taliesin theyre not wearing sombreros or anything  laura so what are /none/ you doing keyleth are you staying in there  travis please say no  marisha im just going to seep back down  liam take the stairs though  marisha i take the stairs  matt all right after a few moments keyleth reappears  marisha but before i reappear i go grog im in a boat  all laugh  travis shes in the floor and shes in a boat its magic giggles  liam it is pretty funny  travis will you teach me that sometime  marisha no  matt for a splitsecond as youre doing that /none/  you realize that laughters probably very audible  marisha im not an elemental anymore  matt so as you start laughing you revert back from elemental form  marisha i go teeheehee shh  ashley make a wall  laura wait what did you see keyleth  sam wait is she back  matt yeah her elemental form is gone shes now back into keyleths form  liam were all just on the beach  orion im not  sam thanks ti liam people were still laughing  ashley im laughing just a little bit i maybe peed a /none/ little  orion pike is chuckling at best travis i stop laughing  laura what was it was there anything in there  marisha it seemed like it had dimension door properties  but i dont know if it was necessarily at full dimension door strength  laura were there creatures  marisha there were creatures  there appeared to be these things that ive heard of called gricks  theyre like worms  with beaks and tentacles  laura oh ive heard of gricks theyre really fast  marisha yeah theyre superfast laura yeah they slither  laura yeah /none/ man i studied the underdark liam all right  marisha they did this whole hungry hungry hippos thing  sam but you said it was a gate to another dimension  marisha it seemed to be some sort of dimensional gateway  i dont know which dimension  sam i we come across any people that we can beat information out of  we might want to ask them if this a known thing  a gateway back to the overworld  laura i think it would probably go to the abyss or something  liam or a shortcut into /none/ the marisha into the temple  laura i wonder do they attack things they seemed really fast right  marisha the grick things yeah  laura percy can you make a bomb  sam oh he did already ive got it i have a bomb  laura can you throw the bomb in there and they would all maybe attack it  and maybe it would blow them up  sam maybe it might hit some of them  do we want to go in there because we can certainly do that  laura just throw it from outside and /none/ see what happens  marisha if we take a few minutes and i take another breather  because being a rock elemental takes it out of you for a little bit  and you guys can make some bombs i can go back in there as an elemental  orion actually i think thats a good idea percy  the bomb that scanlan is holding could you fix a thing around it  to possibly hold magic properties  taliesin i have not the slightest clue how to do that  orion you can use some of this one of /dung/ the glass my potion  what do you call those fucking things  travis vials orion yes  sam are we right outside the mouth of the cave right now  laura we are really close to it  sam can we get away from the mouth of the cave  travis okay who needs to rest show of hands who needs rest  marisha im going to rest while they talk  while they figure out a plan  liam tibberhoods do you have any fireballs left in you  sam tmoney what do you think  orion i /none/ cast silence on vax  all laugh  sam i cast dispel magic  orion counterspell  sam countercounterspell  orion do you have counterspell you dont have counterspell  sam no  all laugh  matt all right both you guys go ahead well no roll your counterspell roll  orion counterspell  just fizzles his shit  matt what level is your spell  sam its a level 3 spell  matt so no your spell just pfft  sam damn it  orion and i dont silence him did i have to roll anything to do that /none/  matt no orion oh cool  matt he has to make a save for silence  liam am i silenced  matt whats the save on that one orion 17  matt right but whats the actual save is it wisdom is it intelligence  liam well i rolled pitifully so it probably doesnt matter  orion i just know its 120foot range should write the other stuff down  laura tiberius  was that really necessary  orion no it wasnt but yes i do have fireballs left  and i dispel it immediately  liam yells incoherently /none/  laura shh  liam i didnt know  he was going to dispel it  orion im unpredictable  ashley because i have spiritual weapon  maybe i can try to create a crazyass bomb type of thing  sam we have a bomb  matt you do know that the essence of spiritual weapon  it creates a weapon that is partially in form  with your deitys weapon of choice or preference  its mainly melee weapons nothing too intricate  taliesin we are not making a holy hand grenade  laura we already have a bomb /none/  just throw it in they attack it we close them up  sam i have a bomb travis weve got a bomb  orion with what vex is getting to percy  is if you could fashion such a thing or if i could ill enchant it  laura throw a bomb they attack it  then you can throw a fireball at the same time  we just have to get them in a cluster  orion can i attempt to imbue the bomb with a fireball in it  matt no  that is a delayedblast fireball /none/  which is a higherlevel spell  orion okay  ashley throw the bomb in  laura and liam onetwo punch travis scanlan toss it  sam im not a good thrower is that what you call it thrower  marisha here give it to me and ill go in as an elemental  liam no we can just throw it laura just throw it  sam then youll have to hit it to light it  ashley who has really good dexterity  orion you have a bomb sam i have a bomb  orion hold it out in /dung/ your hand please  sam i dont want to touch it its a saddlebag bomb  liam im not trying  to get it into a basket  laura we just need to throw it into the cave  orion i cast telekinesis  i pick up the bomb and i start guiding it into the cave  laura is it so hard to just throw a freaking bomb into a cave  sam its already in  orion pay attention ranger  matt so the bomb that was constructed ages ago by percy  that was originally intended to /none/ put on a summoned pony  sam yes never got to use it  matt but now is finally being used  tiberius you approach the edge of the cavern  make a stealth check  ashley how do we light it  sam hell light it a what check laura a stealth check  orion im still invisible  matt right so you would have advantage on that  orion oh dope  laura and you have pass without a trace  orion yes whats with that so  matt invisibility and telekinesis are both concentration spells  you /none/ would lose your invisibility to cast telekinesis  orion all right well i rolled 21  matt a 21 total on the first roll  orion yes i rolled a 13 the second time  matt okay got you  so as you make your way up to the edge of the cavern  you come in partially you guide the bomb towards the back  and you lob it towards the far end  this large awkward saddlebagstyle construct  of percys design made of leather metal bands  hits the back wall  taliesin i was very proud /none/ of that  orion as soon as i let go i cast invisibility on myself again  matt okay  orion im going to wait what happens  travis yeah you wait and see what happens  sam lets find out  matt okay the bomb hits the wall hits the ground tumbles for a second  awkwardly slumps over on itself  at which point in a blur of motion the strange hissing sound  a bunch of momentum hits the room  and you see all these creatures begin attacking it  orion as soon as i hear /none/ that noise fireball  laura whats the point of the bomb why not just do that  liam itll ignite the bomb laura youre right it will yeah  matt so the fireball impacts the far end of the wall  where the cluster of these strange worm creatures are  it explodes with a large blasting echoing explosion sound  sam im doing this  matt hold your ears roll damage on that  ashley i take my shield and put it in front of a couple people  taliesin scanlan is there any way you could absorb this /none/ sound  marisha yeah could we cast silence  sam nope he cant too late hes casting like seven spells right now  matt all right how much damage is that  liam once we finish this math this explosion is going to be really cool  laura and really loud  orion 32  matt 32 points of damage orion yeah  matt that blasts open  percy roll 4d6 points of damage from the actual bomb  as the fireball detonates the saddlebag simultaneously  with the explosion of the fireball  taliesin 14 points of damage 4d6 /none/  matt okay all right great  so simultaneously you guys hear explosion noises  you can feel the sand shift and move and some part of the beach  some of the gravel moves and rocks a little bit  taliesin oh god  matt pitchblack smoke comes pouring out of the cavern  you have to guard yourself  liam thats going to attract  some attention  matt as the smoke slowly clears you get a glance in there  and you can see there are bits and pieces and chunks of grick matter  across the /none/ wall and the inside of the cavern  with some gaping halfbodies of these creatures  torn open from the explosion  there is nothing living and nothing moving  from what you can see at the center of this cavern  sam lets go in  matt the occasional dripping sounds chunks dripping off the ceiling  travis excellent ashley is the magic dispelled for sure  laura take a couple steps in and perception  matt perception check liam 15  sam it was a good bomb taliesin it was a very good bomb  sam thank you /none/ for crafting it for me what do i owe you  taliesin your life at this point and a song you owe me a song  sam maybe start on a new one  laura 24  matt okay glancing through you can see the small tunnels  that these creatures house themselves in as a defensive position  these creatures are not hunters theyre more scavengers  but they fight in packs and wait for things to find their way in  this tunnel was definitely a place where they do that to keep fed  however this tunnel /none/ appears to be empty other than  the strange phenomenon of this energy in the tunnel  orion i feel we should camp here for the night  ashley no more magic orion or day whenever the heck  laura is there anything that can come through the portal  taliesin its more just an energy shield  sam before we plan something is there a portal or something  matt make an arcana check liam something funky in here  orion yes of course thats obvious  laura whats all this purple stuff  liam well lets figure it /none/ out  sam 16  matt 16 as you take a moment  and step inside and feel the essence of it  there is no portal there is no doorway there is no tear  theres just a very thin veil between this plane and another  youre unable to really ascertain the nature of this energy coming through  but youre able to see there is these strange warps in reality  as you walk into this room you look at your hands  and for a second your fingers seem to bend and go to form  /none/ as you look at peoples faces they twist and shift and then go back  sam i dont think we should camp here  matt you dont know if its purely a visual thing  or if matter itself is actually twisting  but its very discombobulating being in this room  for any length of time  liam clarota what are we looking at in here  matt clarota as he enters behind you guys  puts his hands together and goes  this i believe is the veil where kvarn stepped into the cavern  orion yes exactly /none/ thats what i was going to say earlier  laura okay tiberius  orion me clarota mm thats what i do with clarota  matt the tentacles writhe around clarotas maw  orion that means he likes me  matt this is a boundary a thin membrane  between this prime material plane and elements of the far realm  marisha the far realm  orion ooh clarota yes do you think we could  after a rest of course conjure a way  and possibly break the barrier and go to that side  matt you wish not to /none/ do that your mind would break  orion oh that would be awful i need it  sam clarota is this a possible thing that we should maybe shut down  could kvarn send his allies through here  matt we have not the power to shut this down  it is how they overlap  laura is it safe to be near it  matt i dont know  all laugh  laura i got him guys i got him  matt well have to find out  orion well at least we know this beach is secure  /none/ we should go out in the front and seal this up for the night  laura you were rather loud  im afraid things might be drawn to this beach from that explosion  ashley we could keep watch  travis i dont need to rest ill stand guard  orion this is inside and i was outside they were hearing stuff inside  taliesin could this veil exist in sunlight  matt i do not know i have not traveled the boundary myself  liam i wonder what would happen  if kvarn was cut off from the other /dung/ side of this  taliesin thats exactly what i was thinking  laura maybe it would be good to block it off  liam or collapse it  taliesin at least wall it off on our way out  sam yeah thats a good idea laura i like it  travis do that you two  marisha like completely cave it in  travis yeah just block it off taliesin just wall it off earthmeld it  marisha i dont think throwing up a stone wall  is going to necessarily stop kvarn  laura no but cant you use /dung/ your rockchanging ability  and squish all the rocks down and close the cave off  taliesin i was just having this conversation  marisha i can spend time essentially collapsing the whole thing  laura yeah  travis i start kicking sand and gravel into the cave  orion wait how wide is the slimmest part of the cave  matt its about 20 25 feet  laura keep going grog youll get there  liam we can camp  but its only been 6 or 7 hours since we woke up really  marisha its been longer  /none/ it was 6 or 7 hours when we were on that side of the thing  taliesin we did take about 8 hours or so  liam 8 hours all right  ashley some of us can stay up i can stay up keep watch  travis me too  marisha theres still things i want to do  liam spill it girl spill it  marisha clarota  matt yes his tentacles quiver as you call his name  and he looks over at you with a curious hungrytobeofservice expression  on his tentacled mind flayer face  marisha /none/ do you have anything that might assist me in a scrying spell  to help spy on kvarn maybe something in his image  matt i have not seen kvarn with my mind or my eyes  ive only heard of him arriving after i was cast out of my colony  taliesin the description of her dream  ashley wait but i had a vision i had a dream  laura so you know what he looks like  marisha do you know what he looks like  ashley well what i saw was like a  laura are /none/ those cheezits youre eating right there  ashley its what i do when im thinking i had a little snack pouch  taliesin crackers all around liam its lembas bread  ashley i saw a single twisted unnatural black horn of  matt which kima mentions again  that that is what were trying to prevent making its way to the surface  orion i see laura okay  matt thats the horn of orcus  laura maybe you can envision the horn  ashley would that work  matt i dont know im not a scrying type  orion /none/ if youll excuse me  i reach into my pouch and pull up the scroll of telescription  i enchant it to reach my brother jerahd  i write on it dear brother it seems i am in a bit of a pickle  with a certain type of creature that can take control of others  with its mind and do nasty things  goes by the name of kvarn and the only thing i know about him  is that he has a black horn please help love tiberius  sam i put a little cologne on the /none/ page  orion he cant smell it scanlan  sam yeah but its always a nice gesture  orion and i send it  matt okay so the scribe rolls itself on top  and poof vanishes in front of you  orion hopefully he answers back promptly  jerahd is a warlock  and is a wizard of the mind arcana things i do not know of  he could possibly help us  and has access to great knowledge in this matter  sam phone a friend  ashley good resource laura i like it  marisha well /none/ i guess while we wait for him to respond  im going to start using all of my stone shape  and im going to start bringing down this tunnel  taliesin im going to work on the boat  marisha just start collapsing it  matt okay  travis still kicking sand in  laura while shes doing that can i use my primeval awareness  and see if theres anything undead or aberrations  or things that are around us that are seeming more active  matt okay you have a long distance you can pull on that /none/ one  you take a moment and concentrate not in your immediate vicinity  you do sense that across the way on that island  there are hundreds of aberrations  travis hundreds taliesin thats two zeros  matt hundreds  you cant make out the details you just sense the presence  you see clusters you see some wandering the outskirts of the island  and the center of the island you sense  there is one very strong source of aberrationbased essence  marisha on the outskirts of the island  matt no in the center  laura /town/ in the center travis in the temple  laura so wait im sensing  would that help you to know that kvarn is an aberration  marisha id assume anything helps  laura im sensing a really strong energy of an aberration  in the middle of town  marisha aberration in the center  laura and thats something that wouldve come out of this portal  right clarota  matt clarota gives you a look and says most likely  or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil  marisha wait what /none/  sam or at least is related to the kin from the other side of the veil  matt that  sam i speak clarota  marisha thank you  matt pay attention druid  marisha i was taking notes  taliesin he said pay attention druid  sam while this is going on i go near lady kima and i start humming  im going to cast suggestion on her  matt okay  sam or try to im just going to say  singing gnome makes you want to check out grogs bod  gnome makes you want /none/ to check out his bod and sweat him so hard  orion is that b52s sam yeah  travis i go over to the water and scoop some and pour it over my head  all laugh  matt as youre doing this grog  kima who at this point as you got out of this conversation  is currently rewrapping the handle of the maul  that she found earlier in the cavern stops what shes doing  glances over at scanlan with a very stern look and goes  gnome i mean no disrespect when i say toy /tavern/ with my mind again  and youll find the business end of this hammer  right up your rectum  all oh  sam and thats the part i need for shitting on beds  so i apologize i apologize im sorry  matt youve bothered me enough recently with your antics  as she does that she motions towards your nether region  id watch it  sam i do call it my antic but yes youre right  im sorry that was disrespectful i apologize  i tried man come on im your wingman  matt she keeps /none/ wrapping the handle of the maul  liam scanlan she didnt say antdick she said antic  sam thank you vax  travis did it work sam i dont think so grog  matt as were

travis ive got to pee  matt 5minute break guys make it quick  well see you back here in 5 minutes thank you  dramatic music  ashley pike grew up  in the outskirts of town  near the bramblewood  her ancestors  were a family of deep gnomes  with quite an unfavorable reputation  thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse  of the last name trickfoot  sarenrae  the goddess of healing and redemption  had other plans /none/ for pikes  greatgreatgrandfather wilhand  who left his family at a young age after a dream  a dream that changed the course  of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on  that him and his family would live a life of service and devotion  as a child  pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people  or even flowers  she felt she had a purpose  in making things whole  that had once been broken  she studied and /none/ learned  the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life  quiet and simple  until one day  wilhand was captured and almost killed  by a group of goliath barbarians  one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome  and he himself was beaten bloodied  and left for dead abandoned by his herd  wilhand went to pike for help  she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered  his /none/ name was grog strongjaw  after that they were best of friends a rather unlikely pair  little did she know  that in a few years time  grog would soon return the favor  and bring her back  from the clutches of death  after being killed in battle  pike felt angry  she wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again  she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her /none/ morningstar in the other  this time pike is ready  travis right listen up  if you have ale  then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite  for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted  for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years  armed with his two /none/ handed great axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks  of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon an unsuspecting  elderly gnome in the woods  he objected to the killing  of such an innocent life  a creature of impulse  grog felt only pity for this  well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly weapon crack  beaten bloody and banished  by the herd leader his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd  it /none/ was then that the relative  of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him  it was the kindness  of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog  bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends  ever since  most nights grog can be found  challenging entire taverns  to wrestling matches ha  or accompanying scanlan  to the nearest house  where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth  would leave you with little information on /none/ the halfelven druid  you might even think  that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing  is kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise  to underestimate her  based on first impressions thunder crack  under that unintimidating petite frame  is a vicious beast  waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions  pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe  of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the /none/ elemental magics  it is her peoples inherent duty  to protect  the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes  begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl  she had quite a knack  for air manipulation  and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long  before the headmaster of the tribe  her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities  and she was inveterated  /none/ to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that  her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced  with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leader to be  must embark on journey  to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce  and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente  or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready  he set her on the path  to truly discovering herself  not knowing /none/ when or if  she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain  towards stillben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente  is proving yourself a strong warrior  a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge  one thought plays in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third  of seven children  born to a noble family who lived  far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone  with so many /dung/ siblings  to share the burdens of lordship  percy turned his attentions  to the sciences  engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple  named lord and lady briarwood  came to court  during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently  took control of the castle  killing or imprisoning  everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon  only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men  as they ran percys sister took /none/  several arrows to the chest and fell  percy kept running  eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom  he did not remember  waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered  the next two years  as he slowly made his way  as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke  offered him vengeance  against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke  percy began to design his first gun  gunshot  sam oh /none/ you havent heard  of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eye on you  a talented musician  master of disguise  and dashingly handsome  in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much  as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome  scanlan used his endless charm  and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin  and support his single mother  one day he was discovered  by a halforc promoter  and joined dr dranzels  spectacular traveling troupe  where /town/ he learned the ways of the world  and honed his skills  as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life  scanlan has never quite come to terms  with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion  while his years on the road  provided many shall we say  educational experiences  with the opposite sex  matt welcome back break is finished  once again i want to remind you guys were just a little over 100 shirts left  if we can manage to get /none/ to 1000 in the next 45 minutes  sam its going to be tight  laura its going to be tight  travis gifts gifts for your friends and family your pets  matt shop for your buddies birthdays  liam your friends are going to be watching the show in under a month  sam you know what  just buy them and then return them after the shows over  all laugh  sam its fine orion just do that  sam well take it matt dont do that  laura dont do that  matt yeah no /dung/ worries guys  so to bring this back to where we were  you guys have been puttering around after youre clearing out this cavern  on the northern shore of this large cave surrounding yugvoril  what is your current plan of action  travis while theyve been sleeping i took my axe  sam wait did we sleep  matt you guys didnt end up resting i think  travis oh no matt just been preparing  travis i thought we rested  laura no we havent rested  marisha ive been collapsing that cavern  matt you /none/ manage to make a way  where the central focal point of this caverns entrance  you manage to eventually carve all the stone to close it off  marisha okay tiberius orion yes  marisha has your brother gotten back to you yet  orion he shouldve got the message immediately  im pretty sure hes researching it before he answers  matt about 20 minutes of you doing this as youre having this discussion  a small slip of parchment apparates in front of you  with a flash of purplish energy  written upon it it says /none/ tiberius you speak of the far realm  which i am quite familiar with there are many aberrations  however i do not know the name kvarn per se  in my research there are many things  that can fall under the description you say  its vague enough  unfortunately i have not much to go off of  if you had an image or a visual description of this creature  id be able to help  but at the moment i have no way of giving you any more knowledge  my apologies and signed at /none/ the bottom  sam may i see this sniffs hmm draconiar noir  all laugh  orion you are astute i say all that stuff out loud  travis i start digging a ditch with my axe in the sand  matt okay  laura what are you digging there grog  taliesin im going to work on the camouflage  travis dont worry about it  matt go ahead and make another tinker check  sam are we in the cavern no were on the beach right  matt you guys are on the beach sam oh thank god /dung/  laura can we hear any kind of movement coming from the other island  does it seem like they heard those explosions  are we safe here  matt the island itself id say is about a quarter to a halfmile away  its hard to tell from this distance with no light source  any movement whatsoever over there or any sound they make over there  liam oh so its really dark  matt yes other than the bioluminescent fungal plant life  and forest that coats this side  you have no light source  on /dung/ that side whatsoever  liam all right laura okay  matt and its just faint enough  where you can make out the outline of the island itself  but beyond that you have very little visual  sam lets sleep  marisha is there any type of stone or rock or debris  with the residual energy from the purple mists of the far realm  matt it doesnt necessarily cling  its more of a presence thing than it is a material clinging energy  marisha okay  liam also im sorry  if its this dark in /dung/ here we lit up the cave  anyone on that island would have seen that  i dont think its very safe here  sam where do you want to go  laura hes doing a camouflagey thing  and she can make it look like nothings on the  liam i know that but no one camouflaged  the explosion of fire that lit up the cave  sam then lets get out of here  why dont we go to the island and see if we can make camp  taliesin lets head to those little buildings  /none/ off the corner there  marisha not yet laura hide  orion i do not think that is wise  sam what whats wrong  marisha im going to sit down near where the far plane portal is  matt which you already closed off at this point in time  marisha i want to be near it though  matt so youre near the edge of the wall where youve already blocked it off  marisha right  matt okay so you get closer to that presence  marisha yeah so i can be close to it  and /none/ clarota pike do any of you want to help me in this  sam what are you doing  marisha im going to do my scrying spell sam oh okay  ashley i can assist because i have that as well  matt you do have scrying as a spell  i would say if you both expend if you have it prepared  do you have scrying prepared  ashley no  all laugh  matt all right well well see what we can do  marisha can i say that because i prepared it i can be like /none/  heres my book you can borrow it i wrote it down i know you know it  matt well see for druids its not so much a spellbook  more than it is just an innate nature  you have a book for your own notetaking but the actual spell itself  comes from you harnessing the divine energy of nature around you  so there wouldnt be a way  that it should be able to help you in that spell  more than a slight bonus to the dc  but ill keep that in mind  /none/ marisha scanlan can you give me some meditation music  sam would that help at all  matt yeah definitely would give inspiration  orion your highness hold on a second wait a minute  marisha what  orion i think were doing this a bit prematurely  marisha why sam she can do it again tomorrow  orion if she fails he will know where we are  laura yeah sam true  marisha he knows were here already  he possessed the queen and said welcome youre my treasured guests  remember that he knows exactly where we /none/ are  sam thats a good impression  ashley thats a really good point taliesin it is actually very good  orion it was because he had eyes to look through  marisha he seems to be pretty powerful and allknowing  im pretty sure he probably knows were fucking here  taliesin i think this is a reasonable risk  laura hes probably just playing with us right now  waiting for us to get there  marisha he said you are our treasured guests  i wrote it down  liam he knows were coming  marisha he /none/ knows were coming he wants us to come  travis to inspire keyleth with her scrying spell  i hop in the ditch ive been digging  and start going look i can do it too laughs  and i start paddling in the ditch  marisha oh good job grog you did it  travis is that inspiration  matt you feel inspired  marisha besides were talking about moving anyway right  so i might as well do it here if were going to relocate  plus i want to be near the energy of the far realm /none/  maybe itll help a little bit  matt its possible  marisha its what im hoping for taliesin lets go for it  sam all right so ill sing to inspire her  scry scry miss keyleth scry  put your eyeballs to the kvarn and tell us why  all right no thats it  taliesin singing this will be the day that i scry  all this will be the day that i scry  all laugh  matt all right then  marisha so wait do i get two inspiration dice  matt no you can /none/ only have one inspiration dice  at any given point in time and its a d10  marisha okay but im happy because of grog right  matt you are sam yes you get happiness  matt so youre smiling through the spell  laughs all right so you take ten minutes to yourself  to prepare the ritual  you carve out a portion of the beach  where the gravel is most easy to manipulate  and you begin to set up this extensive scrying ritual  marisha and i want to meditate specifically on the horn  /dung/ and i want to use pike and see if i can channel her vision  focusing on the horn since thats what we really know  its pretty much the only thing we know what it looks like  matt okay so as you draw the circle  across the portion of the gravel and stonework  actually this is further in the cave  so the gravel has given in to more solid stonework  you begin to carve across the ground  with a small piece of charcoal that you use for your ritual drawings  this giant /none/ runic circle  you draw points for you to sit  and a point for pike to sit as well to help you focus in this vision  once youve taken the ten minutes  to establish all the various material components  and littered it with pieces of dried animal matter some herbs  and lit a small bowl of incense on the side to help you in this spell  you sit down take your place pike you take your place  and you begin to concentrate  you draw the essence of the nature energies around you /dung/  and begin to project your vision  towards the description of this dark horn  pushing what you can best ascertain is the direction of the temple  from where this ritual is being conducted  all right so given the circumstances  bonus from that lets make a will save  all right so  you feel your vision project beyond you  its a sort of outofbody experience as the energy that makes up keyleth  is no longer given physical form its just adrift in the darkness  you feel yourself drawn pulled almost  like /none/ theres an energy that draws you as if poison from a wound  it pulls you upward  and youre looking down over the top of this entire cavern suddenly  the darkness tends to fade for a moment  and you can make out the general outline of this island  once again your vision shhh zooms in and shifts  you can look over the city you can see yugvoril over top  you can see the glowing aspects of the forest  surrounding the outskirts of it  and you can see in the center of this /none/ ruined city  that has been reconstructed in the image of the temple that stands  this giant pseudopyramid with a flattened top  you can now see it from the overhead view of this temple  it is actually open  and that strange glowing source of green energy  you can see is slowly emanating from the top  your vision is pulled forward again  you feel yourself drawn towards it  and as you come towards the top you can see  the open portion of this temples roof is a crossbeam made of gold or /none/ brass  and there is some sort of structure hanging from it  that falls deeper into the temple  you then move past this  into what is the topmost chamber of this temple  its darker at first and as your essence tends to coalesce  and find some sort of visual here you can see now  this brass crossbeam that is held aloft in the center of this temple chamber  drips down into a spiral of metal  this strange arcane contraption  that does not match any of the construct of this temple previously /dung/  it almost seems like its been a new addition  or is taking the place of something else that was a central focus of this chamber  you follow this strange arcane structure about 15 to 20 feet it comes  from the top of the temple chamber to the center  where held aloft underneath it by another 15foot drop  you see in this dark room  a pool of a dull bluish purple liquid  and its pulsing with life and with energy  you now look down your eyes focus  and in this pool /none/  this ten 15footwide round pool  you can see this pulse almost a heartbeat of purplish energy  what look like small purple stones  but theyre not stones theyre minds theyre brains theyre essences  and theyre all working together interconnected  youre looking upon the elder brain of yugvoril  the center of the entire illithid colony  that resides in the center of this chamber  you can see now this green energy thats being brought down  from this metallic structure at the top of this temple  is being funneled down over and is /dung/ acting as an arcane prison for  the elder brain  its sealing and controlling essentially and what you had gathered  from your previous discussions with clarota  this is what has taken the minds of the mind flayers  and bent them to kvarns will  your focus shifts now from the elder brain  and you look around the room and in the dark shadows of this room  you can see there are cages there are metal bars  youre unable to really ascertain what the material is  but in each one of these small /none/ cages you see some creature  some of this realm some not  horrible forms mutated torn some missing limbs  some in the process of slowly dying  because theyre unable to keep a physical form intact  its a collection a horrible collection  of malformed entities that are being experimented on  pulled apart put together  this also serves as seemingly a laboratory for kvarn  and you feel a presence in the room suddenly  your essence shifts around and you look in the darkness  and you see slowly drifting out of the shadow /dung/  a single gnarled black horn  underneath that horn you can see now the physical form that it adorns  dark brown leathery skin with slightly pointed edges  almost like scales that form out of portions of this flesh  you see below this horn one large piercing skyblue eye  that glances up and meets your gaze  as it does from beneath that eye  you see a toothy maw tear into a wide grin  and around the outskirts of the singular eye  numerous other eyes whoosh whoosh shift around  coming into the /none/ light you see now a fleshy ball  that is drifting in the air itself under its own physical form  this aberration this horrible entity is now floating forward  you can see metal plates that are grafted to the physical body of this creature  marisha oh come on  matt apparently kvarn has experimented on itself  these eyes are attached to strange fingerlike stalks  that twist out of its body  these eyes darting around the room looking at different directions  and then they all whoosh singularly shift on you at once  as /none/ it does you can feel all of a sudden your presence  which has been drifting through the scrying spell  locked in place  and for a second you feel like you cant breathe  as kvarn presses towards you  this fleshy sphere of eyestalks and teeth  this small chuckle billows up deep within its mouth  chuckles so guest  do you like my home  youre welcome any time  at which point the horn seems to glow with this creepy greenish energy  and you feel this piercing pain blast into your head  /none/ you try and scream but you cant theres no breath  go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  laura oh no sam oh shit oh god  marisha do i still have my enhance ability up  matt no because thats a concentration spell  liam what does keyleth look like to us right now  matt keyleth is sweating profusely and you can see shes flinching  liam im walking up to keyleth and im grabbing her by the shirt  and im going to slap her across the face  matt all right so  marisha /none/ 27  matt 27 all right good  you take 11 points of psychic damage and are thrust out of the scry spell  your vision is pulled out of the top of the temple  and suddenly youre back in your form  as a sharp pain hits you across the side of the head  marisha ow  matt vax is holding you  marisha christ what why  liam you were in pain are you all right  are you all right  marisha you were in pain  so i thought id fucking slap you across /none/ the face gee  laura keyleth language travis are we hitting each other now  marisha sorry wow  orion and laura what did you see  orion so she tells us right  marisha kvarns a beholder  laura gasps sam a beholder whats that  orion it is really not a thing we want to fight  it is awful it is wretched it will kill all of us  if we dont find out a way to kill it oh my god  marisha not only is kvarn a beholder kvarn has been experimenting on himself  /none/ and so he has armor grafted onto him  and the horn  the horn which i dont know  laura you said there is something caging the elder brain right  marisha yes that big green light  can we can see it is it like the luxor in vegas  can we see the green light  matt its not a beam but you do see a slight green glow  at the top of the temple in the distance  you saw it when you first entered  and its been this dull beacon as you traveled /none/ around this island  laura so theres something connected to the top of the temple  thats caging the elder brain  marisha its like an arcane prison around all of the elder brain  laura is it possible  to maybe collapse the top of the temple from far away  and release the elder brain from its cage  and then clarota your brethren could fight the beholder  instead of us laughs  marisha clarota do you know how we could possibly break this prison  travis could you tell me what a beholder is first  /none/ because i dont know  sam big bad scary thing  travis with finger eyes  orion dm i write a detailed  sam just hold on wait patience  matt thats a beholder  laura oh the thing on the front of the monster manual  ashley its on the cover of a book  travis worst possible scenario imaginable  laura thats all you could have said liam the iconic creature  taliesin its on the cover of dungeons  dragons monthly right now  it is the cover model  liam theres dragon then beholder marisha oh /none/ man  laura i mean weve killed a dragon  travis yeah hes got lots of teeth lets brush em  marisha each eye tends to have a beam that has a different ability  sam yes laura oh  liam its a magic fun bag  marisha its a magic fun bag its probably got everything  from silence and dispel magic  to petrify to a disintegration ray  taliesin youre thinking about this wrong though  youre thinking about this in the wrong direction  beholder is not thats not the goal  laura the horn is /none/ the goal  taliesin even more than that its the hundreds of allies we could have  laura exactly we free the elder brain they attack it  taliesin prison is the target  travis not the beholder  taliesin not the beholder if we can free the elder brain  laura we dont  have to fight it ourselves  taliesin then were not alone  now what was creating this green light where was it emanating from  marisha it seemed to be emanating from the top opening of this pyramid  that was the main temple of /town/ the center of town  taliesin can you describe the top of the pyramid  matt ill give you a detailed description  essentially this pyramid comes to a top  and then flattens up at the very top  where you would expect there to be a flat surface  is instead essentially a windowed opening  you dont think its purely open like you could just jump through  there is some sort of glass that coats it  but there is a brass crossbeam at the very top  and then part of this crossbeam  holds /none/ aloft this strange series of metallic wires  that spiral and intertwine that serves as a conical focus piece  you cant see the interior of it  laura so if we take out the beams  marisha it was almost like a beehive  matt essentially a slow beehive  marisha it was focusing the energy  taliesin we have something very important  we have a vial of yellow liquid  sam what does it do  laura it might age you  marisha we dont know laura it might do something  taliesin it seems to be /none/ very acidic  sam so it could burn the metal ashley burn the beams  taliesin i could melt the metal  and we could actually bring that entire structure crashing down  laura but does anybody have an aging spell  something that causes things to disintegrate things  maybe we could rust the metal as well  taliesin we have that yellow goop and that would definitely help  liam we know that its acid  taliesin we suspect it  laura it might be a form changer  because the king swallowed a vial and it made /none/ him strong  marisha actually i can learn heat metal  and i can heat the beam and make it clicks her tongue beam  laura hes got vials of acid in his bag of holding  ashley excellent  taliesin were going to break the temple  laura lets break the temple clarota  matt at this point as you guys look over at clarota  you see clarota for the first time in a while  looks visually disturbed  has withdrawn from the group  and is leaning against the side of the beach cavern wall  /none/ and the tentacles that normally slowly twirl  are all tensed and pulled up into a knot  laura clarota youre going to cramp  your face if you do that  taliesin if you have something to say we would appreciate it  liam if you keep making that face itll freeze that way  matt that kvarn is  of this new creature a beholder  and carries this horn that lady kima has spoken of  its a great danger also keep in mind  the temple is not made of average stolen metals  this is /none/ the center of the elder brain we reinforce it with magical protection  its the center of our entire species knowledge  every brain in there is our elders as we pass to the next generation  our mind is brought and introduced to the elder brain  we have that room protected from simple acids  we must make sure we are ready  liam clarota keyleth has scried the top of the building right now  it didnt look like it was part of the original structure  is she mistaken is the top something that was built /none/ by your people  matt no it was open before  there seems to be some sort of new focus kvarn has constructed  liam would that be as strong as the rest of the building  matt i do not know  but if ive seen anything of the nature of this insidious creature  i would say plan for the worst  nothing is more terrifying  than underestimating a beholder  laura right can beholders fly marisha yeah  laura they can okay  travis among other things it seems like  laura what cant they do /none/ liam not much  taliesin theyre terrible monsters  laura so theyre really very fleshy and weak  but he put armor on himself  travis hes super strong laura so now hes extra strong  liam like a wizard times 50  marisha im assuming oh go ahead  matt then kima says  the key is here is not to think how to fight him headon  we have to be smart about this  while he has the home turf we have the element of surprise  we choose the grounds in which we attack  and /none/ we choose the methods in which we set the battlefield  marisha underwater fight  sam we could try to just draw him out somehow  matt i highly doubt hes going to leave his home turf  but if we can find a way to perhaps turn it against him  or use it to our advantage  maybe some reconnaissance i dont know  laura reconnaissance  matt i dont know  travis it is glass on the top so we could try to sunlight the head  ashley i have something called divine intervention  laura what /none/ is that  ashley you can call on your deity  and you roll a percentile die  and you can have them help you with something  laura so is it possible  to try to get her help before we do this  or is it something that you have to do on the spot  ashley i dont know because this is new  matt thats up to you you can attempt it once a day  and once it works it cant be done for another week  laura so if we attempt it then she /none/ can intervene  she can be on our side  matt in some way  essentially you formulate how you want your deitys aid  and if you succeed you have a 10 chance of success  in some divine way  sarenrae will guide power or aid to you  sam why dont you wait on that  liam well we either have  a 10 chance right now for her to tell us what to do  liam or a 10 chance sam to help us later  laura once we know what were doing  ashley yeah /none/ lets wait until we know what were doing  orion i believe we should go and rescue the prisoners  and build a small army  moreover ive been thinking  it all goes downward correct hes all up in a pit yes  sam the world down here  orion no the beholder kvarn  liam hes in the top of a pyramid  orion up or down liam and travis up  orion well that wont help me at all  marisha its his laboratory  laura i feel like we should go for the top  travis /none/ how would we free the prisoners first of all  taliesin i think its that beehive structure  laura we have to take out the metal thingy  liam its not letting them out  we have to get them out of kvarns control  so how do we do that  taliesin i think we destroy the beehive structure at the top  laura i think we destroy the structure  liam its the only option that seems open to us  unless we keep stumbling around and looking for some other way i think  laura we dont /none/ have any kind of corruption spell  that ages things  marisha well weve got the acid thing and maybe grog can  laura what if we hit it with dispel magic  maybe get your goddesss aid  hit it with dispel magic hit it with corruption  rust the shit and then it falls  sam but we dont have corruption  liam can scanlan mercilessly mock the top of the thing  sam oh i can mock travis eff you brass cross  marisha i like percys idea weve got that acidic vial  taliesin we have /none/ several vials of acid actually  ashley can you take the normal acid and could we make it magical  laura like extra bad we dont even know what it does yet  marisha well i can always be an eagle and i can maybe fly  or maybe grog could carry a big boulder  that way after the acid has  taliesin i thought about making an acid arrow i really did  marisha he could throw a big boulder to collapse it the rest of the way  liam question you built a bomb before sam that /none/ took months  liam if we could hole up for months or weeks was it  laura and sam months travis yeah it took months  taliesin it took me months to figure out how to build  liam now that you know how to build one would it be quicker  marisha wait the bomb we just threw in that room  taliesin i could make an exploding arrow  ive made one i can make another  matt i would say your materials are very limited  taliesin yeah at this point though if i had a workshop /none/ i could  sam well lets take kimas advice  and maybe start with a little reconnaissance  well get closer well rest for the night  and maybe send in a snooping party  liam my sister says that island is crawling with nasty shits  laura we cant get closer  ashley we should just rest well stay up because were good  laura what if we fly in over the top with the carpet in stealth  put the camouflage on the carpet so they dont see it  fly in over the top stealth in spy /none/ get an idea of  liam inspect the top of the building  see where the acid would be put to good use  laura yeah see what kind of magic is being held on top of it  liam were guessing  that kvarn doesnt want to leave his little cubbyhole  taliesin i would assume not  liam so even if we fly down on top he gets pissed he could fly up  but we could fly away  he probably doesnt want to leave the top of the  taliesin theres going to come a point /none/  where chaos is just going to descend on us  travis were also forgetting  that the second that he sees us or we get close enough  he could control all of our minds  sam wasnt the point of us going to these beaches  to try to see if there was any other advantage we could find  laura we were trying to find clues  so that maybe scrying would be helpful which it was  marisha yeah sam all right  laura okay heres another option dimension door  what if you go and /none/ hug one of the beams and dimension door the beam out  sam i dont think i can do that orion no  sam i can banish a being but not a beam  laura you cant cast a portal on the door and make it fall  taliesin no sadly laura not like portal  liam well weve been here and weve been here  sam should we go to one more beach before we all die  liam here or here or this little nubbin right here  taliesin i was thinking about that  laura those are /none/ just more things to fight  liam well thats true but my sister studied the island  and she sensed the presence of things everywhere  travis that sounds awesome lets go there  matt clustered mainly in the city region  marisha theres no need  for us to relocate now  liam well i am curious about this  can we see this from the beach were on what is this  matt at this distance  its hard to make out any sort of visual  taliesin we could camp there  that could be where we /none/ stage our attack from  travis yeah i like that lets go take over a little shantytown  marisha wait why  sam because itll be that much closer tomorrow  we can do reconnaissance from there  marisha we can do reconnaissance from where we are  sam we still have to get across this body of water  you said theres something swimming down there  marisha weve got a magic carpet  travis itll be a little victory well take over the shantytown  marisha its literally never been a problem  ashley can we all fit /none/ on the magic carpet  laura and travis no matt not at once no  ashley i can waterwalk  liam we can also do two trips on the carpet  marisha but were not all going for reconnaissance are we  laura no stealthy stealth  taliesin if something goes wrong though its going to be  i would rather something go wrong with all of us  than something go wrong with half of us  liam well i tell you what we dont know what to do  so why dont vex and i and scanlan  /none/ go for a little ride and check out the tip of this island  ashley i dont want to be split up travis i dont either  travis lets take over the shantytown lets at least get on the island  sam and taliesin baby steps  travis yeah baby steps  marisha okay well then you guys go check it out first  taliesin well get in the boat and well start heading there  ashley are we getting on the boat or doing the carpet  taliesin well we cant all fit on the carpet  liam lets /none/ let tiberius and the twins and scanlan  fly ahead of the boat quietly carefully see what we see  we have the earrings that tibberhoods crafted for us  so we can tell you what we see  taliesin perfect  liam and we dont want to rush in  were probably going to go here but lets not rush in  let the quiet ones go have a look  laura just to make sure its not crawling with baddies  marisha okay so well start boating over  liam you need to take it easy for a /none/ moment  you just went through some shit keyleth  ashley you guys are going on the carpet laura yeah  marisha yeah im going to take the boat  travis ive got a big axe ill paddle the boat towards the island  marisha awesome  travis ive been practicing in the sand to impress keyleth  working on the elevator  i havent figured it out yet because i dont know what that is  liam you know that thing a dog does when it pulls its butt along the floor  laura but i could cast pass /none/ without a trace  so everybody gets 10 to their stealth rolls  liam yeah that sounds good  travis so whos in the boat with me  sam oh were going over by boat is that whats happening  travis percy keyleth laura trinket  travis pike and trinket so we start paddling in the boat  laura how about kima and clarota clarota should go with us  matt clarota can just hover  laura can clarota be on the carpet then  matt you can have him alongside the carpet  travis yeah well take kima liam /none/ yes  laura yeah clarota come with us travis singing love boat  matt so percy youre on the boat as well  taliesin yeah im in the boat  sam are the rest of us flying were flying  liam team clarence and team kimagibbler  travis watch your mouth  laura clarota im sure weve asked this before  and i wasnt here because i missed a part of a thing  what about your hat what does it do can you make more of them  liam he said no it would take a while sam we /none/ did this already  matt i could but the time required would be months weeks  not in our timeframe i believe  travis thats squid for no  laura all right  liam all right lets do it  quiet ones lets get on the carpet tiberius  laura try to stealth it are we camouflaging the carpet  taliesin im going to attempt  to attach the skin to the bottom of the carpet  matt to the bottom of the carpet  liam were saving the world here people  lets not twiddle our thumbs for too /none/ long  travis but youre on the boat  taliesin well before you guys take off  just going to try and sew it on the corners  matt okay go ahead and make a roll  taliesin thats better 16  matt 16 easy enough to do  all right so you take a little bit of your thick heavy leather thread  the stuff that you use for something  and you loosely attach it to the bottom of the carpet  liam sorry i did a quick scrying spell  and i know that were 50 shirts /none/ away from the total so keep going  get your mother a shirt keep going  sam okay so were over the water  travis yeah were already paddling the boats going too were fucking fast  matt so as grogs pulling along make an athletics check by the way  travis oh yeah about to smash you  laura and were stealthing ahead  matt you guys are laura being sneaky  travis its a 22  matt all right so you pull it across  its a slow speed but youre making your way  i would also /none/ like grog to make a stealth check  laura i rolled a natural 20 on stealth  travis wheres my stealth  taliesin youve got pass without a trace also  travis 19 so 29  matt 29 stealth as youre very carefully breaking the waters surface  okay so as you guys make your way across the channel  towards the far end of the island which is the beach thats in view  you see the water disturbed slightly about 200 feet off to the right  something deep below you can see bubbles rising up  as /none/ you carefully make your way ever so quiet across to the beach  you find purchase  landfall hits you on the other side of the beach  apparently not disturbing whatever lies beneath the surface  travis i immediately hop out pull the boat up just to beach the boat  matt okay so you pull the boat up  the rest of you guys bring the carpet over  you come to a landing part totally fine  the beach comes to a steep incline that leads up onto the island proper  theres cliffs on both sides /town/ of this beach  and as the incline increases  up about maybe 500 600 feet from where you are  you can see what looks like a few buildings  or rubble of what was a small gathering of structures  laura can we check out the thing in the air  liam is there a larger one behind those smaller structures  laura that was it  matt what youre seeing now is this  travis are there any of those crazy trees you mentioned before  matt you do see towards the right of those structures  /none/ those fungalbased trees  they rise about 25 30 feet in the air theres no leaves  its almost like a cluster of weird funguslike vines  that drift from the top surface  and the trees unnaturally sway in place  almost like they have a rhythm to their movement  travis dr seuss trees not cool  matt really nasty dr seuss trees  laura clarota will those trees attack us  are they living and attacky  matt clarota says no those trees merely exist on this island  they feed off of the essence of it /none/  and they provide food for other things that live here  travis like what marisha trees are bad  matt wandering spores laura wandering spores  matt other creatures travis other creatures  matt we feed our captives our slaves of the colony  with the fungal essence of the tree  travis other creatures  dont skimp on the details its only our lives  matt the trees are not dangerous but whatever resides on this island  is probably under the influence of the elder brain  and my people which are in turn under the influence /none/ of kvarn  liam but as youre from this island  what wildlife can we expect to run into here  matt small sightless rats cavern insects  but the dangers lie in the spores that wander the forests  laura im picturing a big yellow thing with little legs  sam pus liam fuzzball  laura is that what it is  matt youll know when you see it  laura well thats lovely thank you for your help  matt spiny laura spiny  matt drifting  travis i take the cask of ale out of the bag /none/ of holding  and pour him a little glass of ale and im like  laura oh you know what grog i hate to tell you this  travis it sounds a little scratchy would you care for some ale  liam its really good  matt its a psychic discussion  he looks at you and gives you a stern look  takes the ale from you  travis why  matt i have no need for such false sustenance  liam clarota that was rude  travis i will not forget that  liam very rude all right /none/  sam can we go inspect those structures up there  liam yes everyone wait here  i grab scanlan by the scruff of the neck and nod at my sister  sam i turn invisible  liam lets go take a peek yes well take a peek just wait a minute  taliesin we can wait thats fine  marisha i actually go collect a few of the vines hanging from the trees  matt all right go ahead and make a nature check  taliesin general perception check on the beach as well  matt all right  /none/ taliesin i dont know why im bothering 11 its a beach  travis i rolled 15  marisha 16  matt 16 on nature  okay from a safe distance you look at it  the trees do not appear to be anything beyond a subterranean forest  fungal trees  marisha i wanted to collect some  matt oh you wanted to go over and collect some  okay its quite a ways up its up the side of the cliff  its up an incline and the forest starts  adjacent to the structure where theyre going  /none/ taliesin might want to wait  matt so you can make a stealth check to make your way there if youd like  marisha no ill wait i thought we were next to a tree  matt no most of the forest starts further up this incline  as the island itself begins to level off  taliesin let the scouts scout  sam lets go scout it out  matt all right  sam so we make our way up to the structure  liam 28 for stealth  matt 28 for stealth you get advantage on your roll /none/  laura is it our old stealth check  can i use my flying stealth check damn it  sam nope  matt what did you roll sam three  matt with advantage  sam that was my advantage the first one was a one  all laugh  laura 31 travis holy shit  matt all right so liam do the twins outweigh him  sam wait plus two that makes it five  laura plus ten pass without a trace  sam oh plus ten thats 15  travis were getting better plus my inspiration from paddling  /none/ matt you guys make your way towards this ruin and as you come to it  you caught a small glimmer of it on the bridge that was constructed  across the first beach you came across in this cavern  the stonework is interesting  its almost like an influx of jade and marble  the stone itself  does not seem to be anything youve seen naturally around the cavern  either it was brought here or was crafted  from some substance that resides on this island  but it has this weird green jade marble almost /town/  veinlike visual to it  and you notice all the structures arent straight and smooth  everything has this slightly noneuclidean bend to it  every edge has a slight curve  its offputting  there isnt a rigidity to any of these walls  and the buildings themselves almost seem to sag  or they sit or rest at a strange unnatural angle  laura these buildings are sad  matt many have been longcrumbled  and you find some of these buildings have fallen in on themselves  you do notice as you approach the edge of /none/ it  there is a large circular structure  a pit that is built central to this  parts of the wall have fallen in  but for the most part still remains intact  and in the center of this pit on the floor  you can see what looks like splotches of dried crimson  longleft blood splatters of some sort of creature  you see dried bones but the bones while dried  have some sort of fungus growing on them  you also see what looks to be tucked against one of the walls  a /none/ campsite but a very large campsite  the fire pit is 15 feet wide and is just a small cinder  you see what looks to be a pile of furs  sam a recent campsite  matt there is actual embers in the fire pit  there looks to be a large bedroll made of patchwork furs  but the pile itself is huge  liam but it looks twice the size of what i would use for a fire  or what i would use for a bedroll  matt three times even  which means it houses /none/ a lot of individuals  sam or one big thing  marisha or a really big thing  liam giants marisha yeah  travis laughs  matt as youre taking this look too as you guys are having this visual you  liam question bigger than grog  matt well you immediately hear a sound  its a slight rumble in the ground and what sounds like a footfall  and as you glance over your shoulder you can see what looks to be  some sort of towering humanoid dragging something behind it  sam singing there are giants /none/ in the sky  matt it glances up with its nose in the air sniffs  who goes there  and you look to see what looks large almost goliathlike  bald skin is smooth no hair but its skin is purplish in color  where a normal giant would stand naturally  its horribly hunched  like its back has a horrible scoliosis twist to it  one giant popping yellow eye glances out  towards the edge of where you guys are  it doesnt seem to have found any of you immediately  but something has alerted /none/ its attention  it seems to have caught some sort of trail  in its natural homestead  you see it standing probably close to 15 20 feet in height  as it begins lumbering up  krsh krsh krsh towards you  liam stealthed  laura oh should we hide can we try to hide  matt all of you were stealthed as well  laura oh yeah  can i do insight and see if it seems like a bad guy  matt you can make an insight check  laura i know im just checking to see /none/ if hes a misunderstood guy  travis do i see him can i do a simple recognize check  matt you dont see him all you guys  are staying back at the beach while theyre checking  orion both of you have got earrings  laura thats 17  matt 17 this entity looks like its hungry  it looks malicious  and looks like its caught the thrill of the hunt  since it seems to have seen something near its homestead moving  as it begins to step forward it drops whatever its holding behind it  /none/ liam im picking up scanlan and moving backwards  laura yeah can we move into the shadows  sam im invisible  liam youre right there laura we know where you are  liam i was holding your hand the whole time  sam okay  matt and that is where were going to leave tonights session  all groan  travis come on liam nowhere near kvarn  marisha and travis really liam nowhere near him  orion no matt yeah  travis but wait maybe if we sell out the shirts  we can go another halfhour or /none/ something  marisha yeah how many shirts do we have left  orion like 20 or something like that  sam didnt make it  didnt make it to kvarn didnt make it to the shirts  liam its kvarn  zac we have to read all the donation messages  if we meet our goal for the shirts by the time were done reading  laura 20 shirts  zac then are you guys cool with doing the qa  all yeah  zac all right so liam if you sell those 20 shirts  travis theres 20 shirts /none/ left laura thats it  liam come on guys 20 shirts

noticed it  matt who wants to pick a question and run with it  laura can we talk about keyleths child murdering  marisha laughs  travis how did the kid die /town/ marisha taliesin yeah tell them  laura this was sad  marisha god i got asked this question at the panel over the weekend too  its a hot topic  everyone wants to know how i killed the kid  well we were fighting  tell us about the fight  matt over the course of the first major arc of their campaign  every town they went to there seemed to be  this recurring theme of children disappearing  so they kept trying to follow this thread and asking around  and these kids kept vanishing  /none/ and the one common thread they were discovering was  shortly before each kid disappeared  they began playing with a new kid who had long black hair and golden eyes  and then they would disappear within a week of playing with that child  towards the end of the campaign during a celebration  after they managed to save the city of emon  they looked over and found that the sovereign uriels child  was talking to this blackhaired goldeneyed child  so the party in the middle of a platform grandstand  bowing before the townspeople /none/  they just pulled their weapons out and jumped off after this child  who grabbed the sovereigns son and pulled him into this pocket dimension  what it turned out to be was this entity  which is a variation of the dread emperor  for those who are familiar with that character  the dread emperor had created this pocket dimension world  this giant bramble forest  that surrounded a gothic castle where it existed  this weird messedup individual brought children there  because it loved to be around their innocence and their naivety  their /none/ sense of play  marisha so basically a sorcerer neverland ranch  matt yeah it was messed up  but once the children got too old they were no longer useful  so he killed them and put them in a basement  so the party gave chase they fought their way to the castle  and they discovered that what was dangerous  about fighting this dread emperor in his library  was it was wearing golden armor  and attached to this armor via four chains were four children by collars  and if anyone attacked him directly /none/  he shared the damage he took with the children  marisha and we actually found these clippers for the chain  laura big golden scissors but we put them in our pocket  and forgot that we had them  marisha we were like sweet clippers pocket keep going  and then we get to this emperor with these giant gold chains  and were like how do you break these gold chains  if only we had clippers oh well we dont  matt however you guys started  attacking the chains with your weapons  and you /none/ were doing enough damage during the first few rounds  to save most of the kids  laura but there was one kid left  marisha so there was one  so we were trying to get these kids away from us  because we dont want to hurt them but we wanted them away  so i used a grasping vine and i was trying to yank the kid away  but the grasping vine attached to the chain instead of the kid  so with the chain at the collar around his neck when the vine yanked  /none/ matt you broke the kids neck  laura i thought you grabbed the kids waist  and he got pulled toward the thing but the chain was still around his neck  matt thats what happened the vine wrapped around his body  and it broke his neck because he was still attached  marisha oh thats right  i should have grabbed the chain but instead  matt you just grabbed the kid  travis sam whats it like being the sexiest member of the group  sam is that what one of the things was  travis yep /none/ taliesin we just want to know  sam its a lot like life  all laugh  sam ive come to accept it its the hand i was dealt  travis matt how do you deal with writers block  and when can we expect trinket plushies  matt trinket plushies would be amazing  i would love to expect those at some point in the future  taliesin i want plushies for all of us  liam we could expect trinket plushies it might not be next week  but i feel like within 12 months there will be /none/ a trinket plushie  matt id like that that would be cool  laura if trinket survives for 12 months  matt as far as writers block good music  i have a number of playlists where if im having a problem  i just close my eyes and listen to good music  a lot of soundtracks i find elder scrolls soundtrack is great  stuff like that gets my mind going  travis how did the group come up with vox machina  taliesin well  all laugh  taliesin oh god do we really want to tell /none/ this story  liam how we came up with vox machina is that the question  zac they asked it  laura yeah our previous name  sam we needed to come up with a name  liam we used to be the shits  we used to be the super high intensity team the shits  taliesin the shits ashley which im still a fan of  laura i think its awesome travis yeah me too shits forever  sam some people didnt think that it was  laura some people that are maybe druid and  travis royalty /none/  sam so we had to come up with something less provocative  taliesin we tried to come up with something  as we were slowly gaining esteem  marisha hey there was a few of us with family ties  taliesin we were all like  okay perhaps we dont want to be known as the shits  marisha over here as well and over

him to know why trinket was so special to me  its such a dorky thing  liam it really is a short story and not a blurb it was long  laura it was a long thing and it was all about  shortly after me and my brother left our family of the elves  and we were setting off on our /town/ own  and he was off in the city and i was making camp outside of town  these people came into the camp and basically i trusted them too much  they kidnapped me and brought me back to their camp  and they were poachers on the black market  and i was in a cage and i could hear a large creature in pain  and through my own wiles i got out of the cage  took out the two hunters and i went to see what animal it was  and it was a giant /none/ bear in a lot of pain  unfortunately it had been cut open from the middle  they had been harvesting the bear but they hadnt killed it  and it was really sad so i felt terrible for it  and i put it out of its misery and felt really bad about it  and then i heard off to the side a small animal make noise  and i realized it was its cub  all no  laura so i took the cub and i felt really horrible  and that was also my first time /dung/ id ever killed any people as well  so trinket was very special to me because i wanted to protect him  and not let him experience that again  ashley trinket  travis did you eat the cub  laura i didnt eat the cub i saved the cub  travis oh

when he brought it up  taliesin sir ian mckellen  matt because my first conversation with him about it was very brief  and very much like cool i was like okay  laura i think because me and travis were so excited about it  matt probably laura it grew on him  matt yeah well drag him in it sometime laura yeah  taliesin wow this is an amazing  laura matt oswalt that would be such a fun guest /none/  matt danny sexbang yeah marisha eminem  travis if grog comes across his uncle yes he would definitely want to kill him  ashley yeah marisha yeah  travis bad relationship  taliesin youve had a little marisha weve had a runin once  taliesin weve had a runin with the family once  travis with his son yeah my cousin  taliesin yeah that was the only time you actually  travis let him go taliesin deflated a conflict  travis yeah well matt yeah you stopped the fight  travis my childhood affection was the only thing /none/ that let him live  matt it was amazing  travis but if we see him again maybe a different outcome  sam hey i have a question i have a question for the dm  is there a spell or a portal or anything out there  where we can all switch bodies with each other  and im keyleth for a while and taliesin is grog for a while  liam what is this an anime episode  sam i dont know it could be cool  matt laughs there are artifacts that can do similar effects yes /none/  laura what sam i want to do that  matt like soul transfers and stuff like that  laura that just seems messed up marisha soul transfers  taliesin so would i be grog then marisha no  sam you would rage taliesin it would just be me as grog  liam someone requested as a player zac eubank  sam ive heard of him ashley yeah  matt probably try that guy in something  liam zac did you type that  zac i would really hate to steal the show guys  all laugh  marisha i /none/ dont think ive seen you stand up so fast  taliesin we could have some kind of freaky friday  matt oh this is a good question what if a party member dies  do we have to scratch out the name on the shirt  sam you could buy a new shirt  matt youre welcome to its a possibility  there are magics that can through challenge reverse death  but death is definitely a possibility  and permanent death is definitely a possibility  liam somebodys going to die eventually matt its probably going to happen  /none/ travis why are you asking the dm dont put ideas in his head  ashley its possible that will happen  liam but if it does happen its your fault  sam thats a season two thing  ashley this time around when we fight kvarn  taliesin that makes the tshirt extra special  laura ooh what are lady kimas and clarotas alignments  can we know that  matt whats what  laura what are lady kimas and clarotas alignments  matt you dont know that  laura we dont know that  matt you have no clue /none/ what their alignments are  taliesin im down for that  marisha has anyone permanently died at any point  taliesin not in this game sam permanently  travis in this campaign  matt nearly ashley almost died permanently  sam some of us have been in comas every other session  ashley hey there is an emote laura  liam throw up the laura emote if there is one  sam how do i get an emote  liam is there a spirit in the room make it known if youre there  sam whats the weirdest thing grogs /none/ ever done as a character  troll dick stuff no wait he went and humped a fairy in another  travis you dont know what happened when i went through the portal  sam yeah what happened up there  orion yeah we dont know what happened  travis a barbarian never kisses and tells  taliesin what about all the other stuff you probably did  will you tell us about that  travis we did summon a pony and chop its head off  sam that was fun travis and smeared its gore all over us  laura /none/ you also collected lots of dried poo  and put it in the bag of holding  travis we had a dried poo chunk  sam we used dried poo to blind the king a few episodes ago  taliesin you ragelooted the ragelooting was pretty much  the most disgraceful thing ive ever seen  laura yeah the ragelooting travis disgraceful or amazing  marisha that got us in a lot of trouble  orion we accidentally killed the ox right because we stuffed it in the bag  taliesin he felt guilty for weeks after he felt genuinely /none/ bad about it  travis minutes after  marisha oh there was also the time you slapped trinket on the ass  and i think you were sleeping on the couch that night  travis that was pretty bad  taliesin laughs  laura gasps we were going through this thing  there were traps everywhere electrical traps everywhere  and all of us were being really cautious  and grog hits trinket on the butt with the blunt of his axe  and sends trinket running through the thing  travis he needed to be motivated  laura and /none/ he just hit every trap on the way through and almost died  ashley oh trinket  travis he was a little clumsy but he got through didnt he  matt yeah  travis yeah and then i slept on the couch for two nights  all laugh  travis i was in big trouble  taliesin erika ishii yuri lowenthal  matt yeah yuris probably going to come in at some point soon  laura he guested before we had the show he came in our game  matt yeah he guested once before the show  sam he /none/ did  matt as ghost fist the dwarven monk  laura you werent there  that was probably a night you were gone somewhere  travis tiefling whats a tiefling  taliesin tieflings are like horned pseudodemonic  liam we havent encountered any tieflings yet  marisha demon blood taliesin theyre playables  laura thats what i want to be if i die i want to roll as a tiefling  taliesin that would be awesome  matt you guys have seen them but theyre very rare in this setting  at least in this part of the world tieflings /none/ are super rare  you havent encountered them much yet yet  liam matt someones asking whats good to roll as  if you are brand new to the game  matt if youre brand new to the game liam fighter  matt fighters pretty easy  i personally would say paladin or ranger are fun  because you can taste a little bit of magic  but youre also combatbased  its a nice introduction to how all things work  and the magic is a slow build you dont get it immediately  so at level one youre /none/ just a melee guy or combat guy  and eventually you start getting abilities  i think the hybrid classes are good for that  taliesin someone asked about percy percy doesnt know if his sister died  and percy doesnt have a plan for his family  because right now percy is scared shitless  of everything going on in the north so no no  matt someone else asked before  how often do players interact with their personal stories  occasionally there hasnt been much room for that  since everyones been underground for this entire run /none/  but there are personal stories happening in the world  and im sure they will come up as things progress as well  they have in the past and theyre going to again  liam someone asked for fan art  do we want the characters to look like us  i think how we really look i think either would be fine  a lot of the stuff thats coming in  is based on the artwork of a woman named kit buss  she took input from us on what we were looking for  and she /none/ did the initial art  and people have riffed off that which is great  matt theyre incredible  liam if you want to make a dragonborn  that looks like orion with his face pulled out  thats cool too  marisha yeah its your interpretation  sam if you want to put my face on every character thats cool  marisha we want to see different interpretations  matt that was a great photoshop laura somebody did do that  taliesin someone did actually do that that was really weird  matt i think kits artwork  were /none/ using as the basis of the official art  but youre welcome to create whatever you want going forward  laura kits really talented  liam could someone draw scanlan  with the illusionary growth and the illusionary wang  laura the illusionary giant weird nipple  sam third purple nipple liam yes  sam and the donkey dong  liam i mean the donkey dong could be in pants or something  it doesnt have to be pornographic  laura this makes me uncomfortable matt yeah  taliesin theres just so much to read  matt do you write /none/ a synopsis for previous ventures  actually the synopsis for each episode  is on the geek  sundry website underneath the episodes  so itll tell you what happens in that episode underneath  just go to geekandsundrycom he writes them all  liam go to geek  sundry then click on shows  then click on critical role and thatll get you there  laura its geekandsundrycomshowscriticalrole  liam its as easy as that matt yeah so simple  travis i think this might have been covered  but how did the campaign start  matt his birthday /none/  liam yeah for my birthday i said i wanted to play dd for a night  and i asked the people that i wanted and they came  and then the next day i sent out an email going  oh man that was so great i feel like we should do that again  and nobody responded for a day and i felt ashamed and sad  because i thought that i was a dork and nobody wanted to do it  but then slowly everyone trickled in going  yeah yeah yeah and here we are  /none/ marisha oh really i didnt know you felt  liam yep for a day i was like  oh god i just outed myself as the biggest dork in the group  marisha laura and matt aw  travis is trinkets intelligence higher than grogs  liam yes laura no  matt no travis no okay its not  laura i think his intelligence is a four so hes two points lower than you  travis yeah suck it liam thats very close  ashley best and worst dd memories  i can only read that because its in all /none/ caps  travis best and worst matt best and worst dd memories  sam our sixhour games were pretty bad  travis laughs sam no i love this  laura dude they were like eight hours  marisha how much do you write and how much do you improv  i mean someone said  how much do we write and how much do we improv  everything the players do is improv  matt yeah theres no preplanning  liam matts writing plot points but hes improvising too  and we have no idea what the hells going to /none/ happen  sam i write all my songs from scratch  all laugh  orion every day he comes in two hours just writing songs  travis does your full name fit into a tweet  taliesin i have been specifically not tweeting my full name yet  laura why travis dont let them have it  taliesin ive been really enjoying  watching people attempt to figure out what it is  right now percys in a hole underground so its not his favorite place to be  travis laughs  taliesin once im actually in a place to /none/ try and impress people  ill be saying my name more  travis did you ever consider doing a longer episode  liam i dont know do you guys want to watch for five hours  laura i know that seems a bit much for you guys  marisha we used to play for eight hours  laura we used to play for eight hours  matt someone asked why do i treat ones as regular failures instead of flops  because i run my campaigns pretty hard  and i think if 1s were critical fails the classic way /none/  we would have tpkd by now  travis whats that matt sam and orion total party kill  matt because in some rule sets when you roll a one its a serious  i like treating it as no matter what youre doing  you fail regardless no matter what your bonus is you fail  i think thats enough  in old campaigns i used to run if you rolled a one attacking somebody  your weapon would go flying across the room  and youd fall on the ground  or if you were trying to lift /none/ a boulder  the boulder would fall and crush you and youre dead  taliesin yeah i like the way you treat it  matt which can be fun for certain games but for this  travis why do you want us to die what a shitty question  matt for this theres enough challenge  where i think we dont need any more reasons  if its funny and it makes sense  if its a difficult challenge and you roll a one  there might be some drawbacks to a failure in that case  but i dont /none/ think its a consistent thing i need to do  marisha people are saying to make them longer  liam sam i saw a question wondering when youre going to make  a weird al yankovicesque compilation of songs  sam laughs liam next month  sam yeah pretty soon im working on an album  orion were going to be in the studio  sam yeah well be in the studio  taliesin scanlan at sunset coming soon  sam its just me changing the words to contemporary songs  but making them about dungeons  dragons and ill /none/ grow my hair like weird al  laura there was one time for a 1 that it was a really funny bad fail  and that was when we were fighting the dread emperor  ashley oh and you went through  taliesin through the stainedglass window  laura and scanlan was trying to get the final blow  and he rolled a one  ashley thats one of my favorite moments  laura and the dread emperor literally sidestepped him  and scanlan fell out of a window  travis he lunged and tell them  matt yeah so /none/ the dread emperor had maybe three or four hit points left  people were hurt on the ground it was this epic confrontation  laura we were dying  travis scanlans never killed anything  matt yeah hes never killed anything  he pulls out his blade and just goes for an attack  and were all like yes go  laura go scanlan  matt and he rolls a one  and its him charging towards him blade in the air  sam quiet war cry  matt you son of a bitch running  dread emperor just sidesteps /none/ scanlan goes flying  liam nothing but net  matt loses his balance  crashes through a threestoryhigh stainedglass window  in the back end of this library out into a bramble bush  with all the glass tumbling onto him and is like ow  travis laughs matt on the ground  ashley it was one of the funniest moments that we had  laura it was really amazing matt it was pretty great  taliesin it was amazing  ashley i was crying i was laughing so hard  orion no holds bard thats the name of your /tavern/ album  all oh  sam no holds bard thats good matt no holds bard i like that  liam ashley scanlan or steve rogers ashley oh man  sam or mr rogers  ashley thats a really hard choice mr rogers for sure i love mr rogers  travis when are you guys going to do a drunk episode  taliesin have we not done a drunk episode  marisha a drunk episode  matt someone asked do i fudge my rolls  no because at that point it becomes too weird  if you dont stick to at /none/ least what roll is there  then you lose the essence of fate  and i think thats what makes it fun for me  it makes it scary because then i dont know whats going to happen  liam scanlan has fudged a bedroll sam i rolled the fudge  marisha question worst possible enemy to fight  probably a beholder  laura a beholder  taliesin a beholder i would imagine is the worst  matt laughs  sam well find out maybe hell be super easy  orion i dont know if you guys noticed  whos /none/ been watching this whole time weve been playing  i generally do random chaotic things  to be quirky and funny just because i like to  but this is the first time i was scared  i really freaked out  with the confirmation its a fucking beholder  its terrible  travis you looked excited  laura yeah you did look excited i think you were excited  that you thought it might be a beholder and then it was  orion yeah and then i was terrified  matt its going to be fun  orion it /town/ was a deluge of terror after that  marisha someone asked how the party met ingame  thats a good question  laura oh thats a good question  taliesin you guys found me in a basement  laura yeah we saved you taliesin yeah i had been arrested  matt the very first game we played  you all had come together as individual mercenaries  in the city of stillben which is a swamp town  on the far eastern side of this continent  you all for your own reasons had come there  because you needed /tavern/ money  you were trying to establish some way of making your skills useful  and there was a job board and all of you came together in a tavern  saw there was a posting  and you decided to combine forces and try it out  thats how that started  and then they met percy along the way in a prison in the umbra hills  taliesin weve never really discussed what i was doing down there  laura yeah i would like to know  taliesin thats a story for another time  travis so why /none/ did scanlan take a dump on that guest room bed  matt yeah scanlan orion hes kooky  sam youll find out when that guy gets to his room  all laugh  sam and just has the worst day  laura laughs travis laughing has the worst day  liam we probably talked about this in the last qa  but im sure theres a lot of new people here  they want to know about pikes death  marisha yeah laura fake cries  marisha it was so sad laura it was so sad  liam keyleth looked /none/ at her and thought she was a kid and then  matt and marisha laugh  marisha and i was just like i hate kids pshh  matt ill try to make it quick  in what was the final boss battle for the first arc  they were going towards the center of the city  because a glabrezu a treachery demon  had infiltrated the sovereign uriel the king of the area and his family  filled their bodies with shades as opposed to their souls  they managed to recover the family  but they got into /none/ a conflict with the glabrezu  and as the fight was ensuing pike got too close  the glabrezu took a swipe at her and rolled a critical hit  and did enough damage to bring her to death instantly  so midfight went down the whole party froze  ashley i had already taken some hits and then i realized at a certain point  because in the pathfinder edition if youre negative  matt your constitution score  ashley your constitution and then i wasnt keeping track  and i looked down and it was way past my /none/ constitution  and i was like oh matt so what does it mean if youre this  the look that he gave me he was like oh  and he just paused because he was like oh that youre dead  all laugh  ashley he was trying to figure out a way to say it  matt it was awful  ashley and i instantly started crying i was like no no no no  travis theres a video of it  laura all of us are crying ashley it was horrible  travis you went under the table /none/  marisha its on liams vine if you go find liams vine  theres a fivesecond clip of all of us just screaming bloody murder  matt it wasnt just like she fell and died  the glabrezu has giant pincers  grabbed her by the torso lifted her up and then snapped her in half essentially  marisha yeah laura it was terrible  matt and they had to recover both halves of her  taliesin how long ago was that  matt that was over a year ago orion it was a year yeah  marisha i remember /none/ you saying youd had a bad week too  matt no it wasnt a year almost a year  ashley i did  laura you were on your way out the door  and then we talked you into staying for a little longer  because we were getting into the fight and you were like okay ill stay  ashley i was like ill stay laura and then she died  marisha thats right you were going to go somewhere  ashley in case anybody gets hurt  marisha oh thats right because didnt you have guests  you /none/ had people who were visiting you  and you went back and youre like  cries you dont understand  matt i definitely have ideas to keep the campaign going past level 20  and to epic or mythic stages  i would like to if it goes that long we shall see  sam what happens at level 20  marisha we start killing gods  orion there was a question for everybody you cannot pick yourself  which is your favorite character  laura oh whats our ooh thats a tough one  liam outside of ourselves  /none/ ashley i would pick grog or scanlan but also rogues  the damage that you can do is so crazy  travis i pick mercer nobody else can take it  matt im not a character travis youre many characters  matt well thats cheating travis is it  liam oh its so hard laura thats so hard i love everyone  taliesin i think lauras actually my favorite character  laura really  taliesin you have these very interesting emotional reactions to things  that i find really entertaining from my side of the table  liam scanlan is /none/ really hard to beat for laughs  but tiberius is so quirky i love that  i love how klutzy keyleth is with raw power at the same time  im very partial to my twin  laura oh taliesin aw  liam trinket is pretty great laura trinket is the bomb  liam its hard to pick  marisha its hard to pick i dont know i have a soft spot for grog  travis oh keyleth  orion i agree i would like to do the complete opposite of tiberius  with rage and just tear shit apart /none/ with my teeth  marisha i like percy too im not going to lie  taliesin aw  laura yeah everybodys great  marisha percy as a character  laura i dont have as much fun playing if sams not there  because scanlan is such a funny fun character and your ideas for things  even right from where we first started playing  the things that you came up with to  taliesin burt reynolds laura yeah burt reynolds  travis fucking burt reynolds sam hes coming back soon  laura all these different things that you would /none/ do  its just so different  travis burt reynolds the customs officer  taliesin with the badge  matt thats one of my favorite deterrents  you avoided essentially what would have been a throwdown  with the entire thieves guild of emon by bluffing your way  marisha finger mustache  matt by pulling out a silver star laura and a fake mustache  matt and convincing them  that you were part of the customs department  orion pike would be super fun to play too because clerics are crazy  marisha yeah pikes great  taliesin /none/ youre really the heart of the group  we dont pretend that losing you  wouldnt have broken us into tiny little pieces  matt gilmore sam gilmore  matt you guys havent met gilmore yet  laura oh my god you guys are going to love him  sam i cant wait taliesin you havent met gilmore  marisha they havent met gilmore  sam what is it  gilmores glorious goods  marisha and laura gilmores glorious goods  travis we havent been to gilmores  laura no not since the show started  matt they havent seen /none/ emon yet  ashley another really special thing that weve done  is that during christmas time  sam oh yeah  theres a christmas episode  ashley we always have specials or winters fest  taliesin we get to do a christmas special online this year  ashley and we always give each other presents from our characters  and its probably my favorite thing ever  taliesin it is so amazing ashley its so amazing  marisha we come in christmas pajamas  ashley the first christmas grog gave me two pine cone earrings  laura literally pine /town/ cones  it was street  travis they were pine cones  marisha i still have the pine cones you gave me  taliesin i still have the bag of leftover ikea crap  matt thats a good question which laura should answer  what kind of dice do you all use and what do you do with bad dice  orion laughs marisha oh i love your dice thing  ashley i currently want to burn my dice laura yeah you should  ashley because ive been rolling like a  travis you had a good initiative  laura /none/ ive told you the last five games to get rid of your dice  ashley i know you have  laura because thats what i do if i roll with a  travis yeah you are fickle on your dice though come on  laura i am fickle if i roll a one its gone for the game  i wont roll it again  but if it rolls bad more than three times  its out its gone  orion its done  marisha you have a dice graveyard  laura there is a dice graveyard and i spent /none/ a lot of money  on these really beautiful  amethyst dice  orion and theyre garbage now  marisha you should auction them  you should auction  all your graveyard dice  laura i should orion no theyre cursed  laura thats true  but theyre beautiful  taliesin theyre worth more money because theyre cursed  orion oh you could buy cursed die which is now a mystical item  liam guys there is no god  and it is the cold random chance of the universe  orion and matt crack up  ashley only cold /none/ random chance of what liam of the universe  laura no because some people roll bad some dice roll bad  liam theres no magic dice  taliesin there is only one god and it is  taliesin and matt the dice god marisha the dice god  taliesin he is cruel and painful  orion that is true when it comes to dice  ashley just on principle i cant buy new dice  because im like  its not the dice  laura it is the dice liam its chance  taliesin you got a cool custom die /none/ marisha i did get a custom die  taliesin shes got a custom die and its awesome  orion id pay for cursed dice so were good  sam oh my god thats daunting  matt i did see a question someone asked who has the most magical items tiberius  taliesin tiberius matt tiberius is a hoarder  orion wait what happened  matt someone asked who has the most magical items  orion yeah  marisha someone asked me what my favorite animal to turn into was  id have to say it was probably my tiger my /none/ sabertoothed tiger  ashley minxie marisha and taliesin minxie  marisha minxie form which grog named because grog and i went on a  travis we intimidated this  marisha we went on an intimidation mission  and i was his pet tiger minxie  matt i like that  the name of the one true dice god is rngesus for random number generator  travis i love it taliesin laughs  marisha rngesus matt thats great  ashley hogwarts houses  laura im a hufflepuff marisha what would rngesus do  taliesin hogwarts houses orion is that a group /none/ question  liam hogwarts houses everyone ravenclaw  laura hufflepuff matt hufflepuff  marisha ravenclaw taliesin slytherin  sam never read it never saw it laura gasps  sam dont know anything about it seriously  liam bullshit sam dont know anything about it  travis nothing zero nada sam dont know anything about it  laura slytherin taliesin slytherin  liam hufflepuff sam is that like a  laura no hes not a hufflepuff hes a slytherin  liam sam matt youre a slytherin  liam what the fuck are you talking about  laura what are you orion /none/ im a slytherin  matt hufflepuff  sam im waiting to read it to my son  laura weve got a lot of slytherins in our group  marisha no gryffindors in this bitch get out gryffindor get out  taliesin actually when the final book came out  we went to one of those borders parties and i had my little slytherin robes  i have slytherin robes  and all the slytherin kids were hanging outside of borders  smoking clove cigarettes  and hustling little gryffindor kids for their book money  all laugh  taliesin it /dung/ got really dark ashley that is awesome  liam someone continues to ask  in the last qa i referenced going through a rough patch  and they want to know if im still going through it  and how dd helped  sam okay bye guys  all laugh  orion oh shit sam good night  liam yeah i had a problem with one of my ears  its like two years in no one has diagnosed it correctly  in the beginning it was wildly disorienting  i didnt know what was going on  the symptoms /none/ were way more extreme than what im going through now  so its not gone but its managed  and ive found that running helps a lot which is why i run like a madman now  and the most important thing in my life  is my wife and my two children  the second most important thing in my life  are the people on this couch and this bench  its kind of eclipsed my job for me in the last couple of years  looking forward to these nights was huge for me  both when /none/ i was in the thick of it and still  and i look at everyone here as a second family  ashley oh liam marisha we love you  laura im going to make a liam plushie  ashley yeah man  matt love this guy here look at all the hearts  travis oh yeah weve got to go on honesty hour now  give them the whole shebang ride the feels  matt has pike tried healing laughs  laura its a medicine roll over and over and over again  matt she heals quite a bit its /none/ been awesome  ive seen this a bit advice for firsttime dms  ill give a bunch of that if we end up doing the week off  but quickly i would say  improvisational classes help tremendously  but being able to think on your feet  be open to players being creative dont always shut people down  its not you against them it can be but i like to think of it more open  you can let them try whatever they come up with  but depending on how elaborate or how ridiculous it is  /none/ it might be really hard to happen  and let them fail spectacularly because it makes a great story  build out a sheet of a bunch of fantasy names  in case they go to a place or meet an npc you werent expecting  then you can just pick a name  and make something up on the spot about it  and take notes afterward  liam thats not how you do it though  matt its how i used to do it i wouldnt know where people would go  and id have a whole list /none/ of names and id be like  liam you just have the universe printed on the inside of your skull  matt kind of  but i still have to pick out of random places sometimes  depending on what you guys do  liam oh  all laugh  taliesin i dont want to know how its done  laura i know no  marisha hes destroying the illusion  liam this all exists somewhere else doesnt it  matt most of it does i write a lot of it up  but there are moments where you have /none/ to pull out of the ether  because players go this way and youre like uh all right  lets see where this goes  but have fun learn the rules well  because everyones going to look to you for rules  have fun let players play let them be creative  and let them succeed or fail spectacularly  marisha have we ever thrown a total curveball at you  where youve had to do that  where youve had to be like  uh uh  matt a few times i tend to prepare pretty openly and /none/ loosely  so i can have  some realm of understanding  where you guys are going  marisha like that time  we sneaked in the back door of the thieves guild  matt yeah that was liam that was one of them  laura because we just went straight for it  matt yeah  liam what about when grog decided he wanted to vet people  to guard greyskull keep  matt yep  liam that was pulled out of your ass right  matt a lot of that was pulled out of my ass  liam /tavern/ very well done taliesin that was amazing  laura oh yeah ashley that was so great  sam we havent gone to the keep yet have we  laura i know we havent been back  liam not since we left the last private game before this  travis we got the last six guards that are totally awesome  ashley our warm comfy beds that we havent gotten to sleep in yet  laura ooh which game of thrones house do we belong to  travis baratheon laura stark  ashley probably stark sam slytherin  all laugh  /none/ marisha slytherin laughs taliesin greyjoy  orion somebody asked if tiberius is inspired by a particular wizard  or something like that he actually is somebody mentioned elminster  liam tony roberts orion tony roberts thats exactly  matt and orion laugh  orion thats going to be funny if i actually do that  but no tiberius is actually based off elminster aumar  who i play in neverwinter the mmo  i booked that  before we started the group  and then when i decided to make him a sorcerer i was like  it was right /none/ at the same time too  matt yeah same time  orion we just started to play and that happened and  yeah so hes a dragonborn elminster  liam billy mays here for the wizards academy  ashley billy mays here with another fantastic creation  sam are scanlans feelings for pike mutual  pike come on give us a hint  travis yeah give us something  marisha i know its been two years and we dont know  ashley i just dont know because pikes heart might belong to somebody else  laura gasps  sam wait /none/ what i never heard this in two years  ashley its my backstory as a character thats just personal  its my secret that i deal with whether people know it or not  matt intrigue  travis youre in love with the dread pirate roberts  laura i told everybody my trinket story  ashley its something im still working out  i havent talked to matt about it  matt let a girl keep her secrets  sam well maybe scanlan has somebody else in mind as well  all laugh  taliesin well this got uncomfortable really /none/ quickly  marisha yeah laughs orion scanlan denied  matt i did not start with newgrounds voices  but i have been watching newgrounds since late 90s  ashley but that doesnt mean i couldnt possibly love scanlan  sam theres a chance ashley there might be a chance  orion thats all you need  sam i could change your heart with enough spells  ashley laughs  travis were you guys ever playing during the dd scare of the 80s  whatever that means  sam what does that mean ashley what is that  matt oh the /none/ chick tracts  laura oh when they said it was satanic and stuff no  taliesin no i wasnt playing until the 90s  travis no were all much younger  liam maybe in 89 i might have been  travis important how sexy is grog as sexy as you want him to be  matt enjoy your boxes buddy  liam yeah i started when i was 10 or 11 in grade school  which was the very end of the 80s  taliesin oh my god this is going so fast  travis can we have a kima /none/ wedding  laura oh grog and kima travis im working on her  taliesin where do you get your awesome shirts  they want to know where your shirts come from  travis oh  taliesin the internet travis yeah  orion we did start this campaign in a different thing  we started in pathfinder and for a lot of us me included  that was the first time playing dd  so matthew homebrewed everything in pathfinder  and then right before we decided to do this  we switched over to 5th edition  matt it was /none/ better for a group this size  i think pathfinder with eight players  becomes too weigheddown with floating modifiers  and it becomes very difficult to keep fluid  its fine if youre a bunch of friends  at home playing for eight hours  but when youre playing in front of an audience of thousands  on the internet every week  we have to use a system that makes combat go a lot quicker  so 5th edition was the way to go  liam i see a good one i have an answer ill start  /dung/ matt theres your emote laura liam there it is  laura oh greg did it oh with a little porty emote  thats cute thanks greg miller  travis you and a wiener onscreen  liam someone wants to know  what our favorite moment has been since we started critical role  mine was sneaking into the illithid captains room  with scanlan holding a bucket of poop i was scared to death  i didnt know what was going to happen and it went great  matt yeah you guys rolled really well  liam it was electric /dung/ that was mine anybody else  taliesin my first crit with my new gun  which was also my first kill with my new gun  laura that was so awesome  taliesin that felt really good that felt good  matt taking out the abyssal abomination  taliesin that felt nice  sam i think for me i enjoyed springing keyleth out of jail  by convincing the guards she had pubic lice  travis laughs marisha yes  matt yeah i forgot about that laura was that during the game  taliesin that was not during the show /none/ laura oh that was before the show  sam before the show oh okay  marisha that was a good one though laura that was a good one  marisha was that the same time  where i ran at the wall and started foaming at the mouth  sam you were crazy  laura yeah and we had to bust you out that and percy was an awesome lawyer  taliesin oh thats right  sam we had a whole phoenix wright party taliesin id forgotten about that  marisha we basically took the insanity plea  to get /none/ me out of prison as a team  laura thats a good question matt i just saw if we all die  or if some of us die  do we have to roll in at a level one or do we start at a higher level  matt no you guys would start a level behind the rest of the group  the detriment to it is you would be a level lower  that is the drawback of dying or losing a character  is you would be a level or a halflevel behind the rest of the /none/ party  laura on top of losing a character  sam new character would be rough man ashley that would suck  matt its possible you guys all know it  we all knew it going in  sam can i come back as spiderman or something  matt im not going to hold that back  taliesin youre not spiderman  matt im not going to be marvel in this bitch okay  im not going to be like oh death  i can take it back any time and it doesnt matter anymore no  travis do you /none/ design specific things for an hourglass  are there particular scenarios that require it  matt there are its harder to do in the underdark  there arent so many traps or timed circumstances  i like the hourglass  for certain circumstances that have a very definite time limit  and i do think up what the challenge is what type of skills would work  or let the players come up with creative ways  that they can apply their skills to a situation to succeed  and i figure out loosely off the 4th edition rules  /none/ where i have number of successes  vs number of failures  in that period of time  and if they dont manage to do it in that time period its a failure  i think its fun it builds the tension  and the party goes oh shit weve got to do this now  i love it hourglass is awesome  laura do we play any other tabletop games  sam risk taliesin yeah  ashley risk  marisha how do you mean tabletop all tabletop  liam board games anything  orion im a big magic the /dung/ gathering guy we play  marisha yeah we like magic the gathering  ashley settlers of catan marisha settlers of catan  matt mansions of madness taliesin mansions of madness yeah  marisha i think the four of us here are all warmachine hordes players  matt yeah  liam ive been playing the board game dungeon  which is ddinspired  someone also asked whats a good way  to get your wife or your kids or friends involved  i yanked my eightyearold son in by playing dungeon with him  and he totally got into it because /dung/ of dungeon  and now i am dming a game for three eightyearolds  matt which is awesome  liam its like ddlight in a board game  and if they like the board game  you can say you know if you like this we can ratchet up a bit  marisha yeah theres also dd board games  branded dd board games that are fun mini dungeon delvers theyre fun  orion i will be on mulligan soon  and i like red and white blue and black and all the colors of the rainbow  laura i /none/ just did that show with wil  titansgrave which is a different tabletop rpg  and its really fun  matt how do i handle  experience leveling in this game  at certain milestones when characters have a chance to rest  have a breather or sleep for the evening  then thats when experience is divvied out for the next session  characters dont level in the middle of a battle or anything  but i keep track of it usually on a session by session basis  and if theres a moment of rest then people can /none/ level up  i also saw a question  when did percy build the bad news and how long did it take  taliesin bad news was built during the changeover to 5th edition  took about  matt four or five months  taliesin yeah it was about four or five months  matt ingame  taliesin ingame  sitting at a table just tinkering and tinkering  travis somebody asked how i became a goliath  because its not an official race in the book is it not an official race  liam its now in 5th edition /none/ in one of the added books  travis now it is i think i asked matt  what the bigger creatures were in the world  and he said orcs and other things  and he also said there were goliaths that were half and half  and i was like can i be that he was like sure  matt yeah  travis that was a thing i asked marisha once  during our first game was  wait i can do whatever i want kind of  marisha do whatever you want its awesome  travis you can /none/ try marisha fun imaginative world  matt how is critical role going compared to how you envisioned it  sam pretty good orion envisioned it  matt one of our biggest fears when this thing came to our attention  when geek  sundry contacted us  was we didnt want it to change the game for us  we did this together for fun  we enjoyed it and it was just a wonderful thing for us for two years  orion two years plus man  matt and so our biggest fear was it changing that dynamic  /none/ and so we tried to be very careful that we didnt alter how we played  and didnt change the format really other than having cameras  liam we didnt want it to turn into a reality tv show  laura i was worried even when we were figuring out  the setup of the tables how it was going to work  that being far away from each other was going to screw things up  but its just like when we were playing at our house  across the table from each other  matt just a little /none/ more distance  theres been very little change except we have other people now  that we dont have to spend hours telling them  oh what we do is we play this and this is what happened  you guys already know because you watched it  and its awesome  marisha yeah thats true  liam theres a light goose to the energy  because it feels like were doing theater  which is the one added difference that i like  because when we played at home we would have moments  where wed go into lulls /none/ or get tired or something  and that doesnt happen here  laura were also only playing for three hours as opposed to eight  orion and im drinking a lot less  taliesin its much more kinetic  travis how do you handle percy crafting things  taliesin i make a standard roll plus what is it  is it dexterity and a modifier on top of that  matt yeah hes proficient with a tinkering kit essentially  so its a proficiency bonus on top of that  and what it will be is  hell tell me /none/  or describe to me the schematics of what hes trying to build  and what materials he has at his disposal  or ask me what he needs for it  taliesin i built keyleth a special staff ages ago  marisha yes  matt so if he has the materials ill tell him how expensive it is  or how to get the materials and he attempts the roll  if he fails wastes all the materials its a complete waste  taliesin man ive been doing a lot lately  matt if he rolls decent its functional /none/ for the most part  but the thing with tinkering is  it doesnt always quite work how you want  if he rolls really well then its pretty damn good  taliesin and i get a bonus if im actually back at the keep  matt at the workshop the keep has a workshop for him  laura i saw a thing asking what was it like  shooting the opening credits  all laugh  marisha that was fun  laura being in costume for it and everything  liam silly  laura which is really funny  /none/ because we did not plan  on being in costume  travis no we thought maybe one or two things  laura like a bracer or carry a weapon  taliesin and then matt and i emptied out our ren faire closets  matt yep  travis and then alcohol made its way in  laura we all showed up and were like oh this is cool lets put this on  marisha yeah it just kept getting more and more involved  orion everybody give a quick huzzah to jareth  all huzzah to jareth  orion he graduated /none/ high school today  laura oh nice congratulations matt congratulations buddy  marisha congratulations  travis somebody asked if you accept fan art  would you also accept someone making fight music for the game  liam yeah matt totally  taliesin we dont want to tell anybody what not to do  sam i would accept a small statue of pike  that i can hold near my breast  taliesin i dont want to see that  laura didnt you have one made sam i did have one made ingame  ashley and thats what saved my life /none/  laura gasps thats right it did it saved her life  sam i made two i made one of me that i gave to you  and one of you that i keep with me  taliesin is it overwhelming having 8000 people watching  travis no taliesin no  matt its not overwhelming its really cool  its good to know theres people out there  that have any interest in dungeons  dragons  i grew up an indoor kid  i was not quite sure if i could tell people i play this game  and /none/ now people are much more open to the idea  like oh dungeons  dragons  it used to be like you play dd what the shit  now its you play dd  whats it like  its much more open its great  liam one of our favorite things  about all the feedback were getting through social media  is how many of you guys are starting to play the game  all yeah thats cool ashley thats awesome  marisha everyone should try dd  taliesin the world would be a better place with more dd /none/  marisha the world would be a better place with more dd  liam somebody asked  what each of our favorite thing about playing dd is  the people  we all do a decent amount of gaming in this group  so this just feels like the most social friendoriented  it just feels real because were hashing it out together  instead of doing this  travis personalities are fucking great orion which isnt bad  liam which is great we all do it but its a nice counterbalance  orion somebody asked why tiberius is so /none/ loyal to keyleth  tiberius comes from a presidential family  a family of political power of highseating in his land  so hes very honorable and keyleth is royalty in his eyes  he didnt know because that was a reveal for keyleths character  i think it was a year and a half we were playing  and then you revealed it  marisha it was a while before i told you guys i was a princess  liam hey its scott white happy 10th episode hey scott  all scott matt thanks for coming  liam actor /none/ scott white  travis people asked if this will be on video on demand  or if people miss it how do they see it  sam pay per view  zac itll be up on the website marisha on the website  taliesin i think were just both really snooty  which is why we kind of hang out  laura dude scott  i was just talking to amanda wyatt today about your concert the other night  and i wish i would have been there  sam no laura different one  sam no its a totally /none/ different scott white  taliesin someone asked if its weird not being a fantasy character  in a fantasy setting for percy as a gunslinger  i really like it i will actually admit  that ive always been fascinated by that moment in history  where suddenly we went from bows and arrows to guns  so i really like the idea  of being the guy who made that terrible mistake  and had this really bad idea and im really enjoying  marisha rping that guy  taliesin rping that guy and trying to figure out  /none/ what would drive a human being to do something so stupid  as to invent a gun  liam i love that we have percy in our group  marisha which i think is why percy is one of my favorite characters  taliesin hes really screwing the entire future at this point  matt yeah  orion somebody asked us a fun question  if each of us could have a familiar like trinket  if we could have our own animal what would it be  marisha like as our character  laura like a pet marisha incharacter /none/  orion tiberius of course  would have a small dragonite or pseudodragon definitely  taliesin flying squirrel  liam thats what i was going to fucking say  taliesin bam  orion oh and the dragons name would be monty  marisha keyleth would probably have a mountain lion  keyleth likes cats and she lived in the mountains  so something native would have been mountain liony  orion thanks effigy  matt thanks for staying sam  sam oh yeah bye guys all bye sam  matt sams got to run  back to his family  /none/ taliesin sam  text me the change in schedule if you get a second  zac i actually think thats a pretty good time  to start winding this down  liam yeah  orion its only 1130  zac its been an hourlong qa so i think its a pretty good time  marisha its been an hour  matt all right so well get a few more questions here  and then well go ahead and close it on this guys  marisha going back to the question of my favorite thing about dd  because that kind /none/ of got segued out  aside from the people  i think that its something really fantastic  not to sound cheesy and magical  when a group of grown adults can get together  and use their imagination and have an amazing time  and my favorite thing about dungeons  dragons  is when you walk away from it and especially after youve slept on it  and after you meditate on it its pretty much real  its just as real as other things we do in our daytoday lives  if you guys noticed how excited /none/ we got  when we were like oh my god you guys havent met gilmore yet  and all of us went oh my god gilmore and we all got excited over an npc  orion nothing that exists really  laura i dream about our characters  marisha yeah i do too yeah i have dreams  laura isnt that crazy  marisha because for us gilmore is real  and pike is real which is why we all fucking cried our eyes out  when pike died  taliesin is it my imagination that gilmore is blond by /none/ the way  does everybody else see gilmore as very blond  laura oh i pictured gilmore with black hair  ashley i pictured him with black hair too  taliesin i saw big curly blond hair  laura oh i like that  i pictured him with black slickedback greasy hair in a ponytail  taliesin i can see that too  orion whats your favorite part ashley  ashley its funny because when we first started  and for the two years that weve been doing it  there was an element that i liked about it  /none/ that it was just ours and then when i would try to tell people  i was like ugh theyre not going to understand  we get to go and play makebelieve  and nobody is judging anybody and we can just go do it  so i was hesitant when we were starting the show  but whats been awesome  is that you guys have been so accepting  and such an amazing group in the chat room  and how you guys have been supportive of us  this has been one of my favorite things that /none/ ive been a part of in my life  thats a really bold statement  matt no i feel the same way  ashley i love it so much after two years  obviously theres so much more of an attachment to it  but i just love it i love it so much  taliesin everyones so nice i barely believe its the internet  matt oh look at all the ashley hearts  taliesin aww ashley hey man  zac somebody wanted to know  if any of you guys had ever reached god mode status  in /none/ past dd campaigns  marisha no taliesin yes  zac yes you have  taliesin yeah i did  but my dm was not very good so the game got so boring  we quit because our dm was weak  matt someone asked about the pewdiepie thing  what it was like dming for him and ken  it was fun they were great they were a lot of fun  we only had half an hour to play  both for me to teach them and to play through a session  so it was a very new /none/ challenge of  all right lets do this dungeons  dragons  but it worked out pretty well  we had a good time and left on a cliffhanger  and as long as they want to keep bringing me back  to do it occasionally im happy to  so let them know that you enjoyed it  and they should have me back because it was a good time  orion im going to say what my favorite part of dd is  marisha whats your favorite part of dd orion  orion much like doing improv its /none/ a wonderful escape  i know im really frantic in how i play it poor matthew  he puts up with arguments about spells that i want to make super op  and hes like you cant do that im like but why  those are our arguments  matt just keeping the balance  orion when we got together and we would play for 8 hours  we would get together and have lunch or dinner  and we would spend a lot of time and every game was a very special day  so no matter if the /none/ day was going great or not  it didnt matter because as soon as the game started  it was a whole different world that we had to step into  and now we live in it and we breathe it  its great were all actors  and to get lost in each other and with how matthew narrates  and youll see it when you watch the show  im like oh and theres cameras now and thats a whole other layer  and i still get lost in keyleth shedding a tear  and the way clarota /none/ interacts differently  i dont see matthew doing it i see creature noise that  laura isnt that crazy  that its instantly clarota and its instantly kima  its not matt anymore as soon as its that character  orion so it is that sense of realistic magic  that exists every single game  marisha its weird too because i almost feel like  bringing the game public and for everybody else  and the fact that were doing it weekly  its almost bled the reality lines even more  because now they are like oh yeah /none/ totally clarota  yeah we totally know who youre talking about  and so were like yeah clarota right  you guys know clarota and were getting fan art  taliesin this is the speed our personal text messages  or group text messages go at  marisha laughs yeah its true  ashley our group text message thread is insane  marisha yeah  ashley the fan art that you guys have been putting out  is so amazing  laura it makes us so happy  zac were working on getting all of that up on the website /none/ were working on it  laura awesome matt thats going to be great  laura i save so many pictures to my phone  liam i save it all  laura i have no reason for it  but i scroll through it when im by myself  liam i have a process  it goes into my iphone folder and then right into dropbox  taliesin you find all the good stuff  laura yeah you find a lot of good stuff  liam man you find so much on the internet  taliesin hes the winner for finding /dung/ stuff  liam pile of shit has a thousand eyes  all laugh  taliesin i love watching people take risks  thats my favorite thing about dd its such a good place to take risks  and the rewards that come with it are so fantastic  matt two quick questions i want to answer real fast  when youre done  taliesin no im done go ahead  matt one how did i get into dungeon mastering  by having a really terrible dungeon master  orion laughs liam thanks to that guy  matt yeah really nice /none/ guy in high school  my first couple of games i ever played and he was just terrible  and he had a player character in the group  that was a paladin but also a samurai  and he gave him all the best magical equipment  and would fight party members it was awful  i got frustrated so i bought the books myself  and learned to do it on my own ive been doing it ever since  orion there you go what was the other thing  matt what was that  orion you said /none/ there were two questions  matt i forgot what the other one was  zac theres another one  that keeps getting asked over and over again  if you guys could be a different race what would you be  laura a different class  orion i think i would want to be japanese  because it would be a whole different cultural experience  marisha and they stay young forever  zac i thought thats what they meant  liam ukraine definitely  taliesin dutch  liam i change my mind about that every day  i think /none/ about what to do once he kills me off  laura yeah i think i definitely if i have to reroll  which i dont ever want to have to do but i would want to be a tiefling  taliesin tieflings are cool  i like being token human token human has been a lot of fun  laura i know i also like being a human matt humans are pretty awesome  orion dragonborn for life matt laughs forever  taliesin my previous character was dragonborn  liam i dont want to say  because im convinced matt /none/ will kill me eventually  and i dont want to spoil whatever i cook up  matt okay laura oh thats true  marisha i might have to bring in a dwarf it might be time  matt if i could play a character it would be a dwarf  probably a dwarf bard i love dwarves so much  laura youre so good at dwarves  liam can we hear your dwarf accent again  marisha well  matt marisha want to give us an example  marisha swedish accent oh you mean this dwarf  orion and matt /none/ crack up  marisha same accent  this dwarf accent  all laugh  ashley its a swedish dwarf  liam similar accent  welcome to ikea  travis wow taliesin that was a dwarf chef  marisha same accent hello hello welcome to kraghammer  taliesin imitates the swedish chef  marisha same accent wheres the d20  orion scottish accent shes the special dwarf  zac i have a good question to end out on  i also like what somebody in the chat room said  that for critical role fans you could call them critters  /none/ marisha gasps critters  liam i said that months ago  laura i love it taliesin cheers  ashley oh critters i love you  matt oh thats awesome thank you liam thank you chat  zac so you guys have officially dubbed yourselves critters  and by yourselves i mean by liam  all laugh  zac the question i think would be good to end out on is  what would each of you recommend to them to tell their friends  to get them into dd  how would you recommend other people push dd onto people /none/  liam live a video game while drinking with your friends  laura and ashley yeah  laura or hanging with your friends you dont have to drink  ashley yeah but i feel that also  the dm makes all the difference in the world find a good dm  which there isnt anyone as good as matt  matt
