noelle hey im healing a gravely injured man did you see me do that i did that it was really hot  molly we know how to deal with pirates can we maybe deal with this situation because we both  want to

melee through the hole in the hull that was caused by  the cannon fire you see the edge of a pirate ship through some cannon smoke out there  h michael i go oh fuck and i let the hunchback drop on the floor and i go over to look  sam peering out the hole in the wall you can see a sleek black cutlass is that what theyre  called a sleek black pirate ship moving around  noelle that is not a cutlass

knowing what  theyre called just going by  sam i know schooner and thats it  yuri the name of the ship is the cutlass  sam sure okay great no its not but okay a sleek black pirate ship seems to be coming about  and you can see movement on the deck it seems like some cannons are being /none/ aimed towards you  thats it also goldilocks roll a perception check  stefanie ten  sam thats enough a bunch of ice sculptures have broken theres lots of water on the floor but  mixed with the ice you feel warm seawater on your feet and realize that your ship is taking on  water  amy put your hands on

sam you guys are coming up this hatch in the middle mad hatter will be first whos next  noelle me  sam peter pan is next  noelle oh im so cute  sam well say wendy is close behind the queen is still downstairs right letting them all go and  then well say scarecrow this is goldilocks come out behind and you guys are looking and youve  seen already you know its there this is the pirate vessel coming around for another attack  stefanie those are the lost boys your men  yuri theyre /none/ tiny theyre so tiny  sam they are getting ready for another cannon shot okay everybody shit shit shit this is  the hard part okay roll for initiative everybody roll a d20 add your initiative to it  ill roll for the boys okay okay  h michael i have a 16  noelle i am an eight  sam okay hold on yup 16 eight yes keep going wendy  molly four  stefanie im an 11  amy i am a four  yuri i am also a four i thought i was certainly going to be /none/ the lowest but no  noelle good job everybody  sam okay oh my god why do i always do this to myself i have 12 people to keep track of okay  here we go so who goes first  h michael it would be me right  sam yes but you were last to come up the staircase you will get to go this round but  because youve never played dd before im going to let someone else go first  h michael oh come on ive got a great opening move  sam all right great /none/ then you know what go for it if you want to do it  h michael so how far is it to the edge of this ship  sam these squares are all five feet so you are standing about 30 feet from the edge  h michael okay i move right to the edge of the boat  sam hes super fast when he moves because hes got these noodle legs  h michael okay and the first thing i do is i menace this motherfucker right at the edge over  here across the water  sam youre /none/ going to use your menacing action to try and intimidate  h michael i want to send some fear out there before this shit gets started  sam okay shit i dont know how menace works hold on let me look wheres your fucking  character sheet  molly isnt it intimidation  sam hes got to roll for it for sure so roll wait no it might be  h michael menacing instead of attacking you can scare one creature intimidate versus insight  sam oh so its intimidate versus insight yes youre right so roll your d20 add /none/ plus five i think  h michael so i get 25  sam oh shit hes done he rolled a one so he is scared of you and on his turn he will probably  run away from you  h michael okay and to be out of the cannon blast ill move two  sam im going to put this on him so we know that he is now intimidated  h michael and then to be not totally in the blast radius ill move back ten feet so two spaces  sam that was a good firstever attack /none/ good job h  h michael hey thanks for the claps you guys  noelle good scarecrow man  h michael oh i forgot one thing i can unsew a part of my head when i menace to show the molding  hay inside of my skull and then i quickly stitch it up and put my branded hat back on  sam great so yes tootles is scared out of his mind hes shaking in his boots and hes a little  kid too so you just scared the shit out of a little kid by showing him your /none/ monstrous moist  insides  h michael dont try to make me feel bad about this i love it  amy that was my strategy later  laughter  sam by the way scarecrow is a monk for those of you who care nibs is going to make an attack  hes going to use a sling and try to hit the closest nibs is this one by the way hes trying  to hit the closest person to him which is scarecrow he rolled a 13 whats your ac whats  your armor class  h michael 13  /none/ sam that hits right  amy yeah baby  sam okay thank you i dont know nothing he hits you with three points of damage  yuri take it  h michael do i write this down  sam yes so you have a hit point maximum there noelle show him his hit points  noelle your hit points are here you have 23  sam so subtract three slightly is going to go next he is this one right here hes going to  sling at you as well you know what hes just out of range of you /none/ so he cant hes going to move  closer hes going to move up here and thats the end of his turn hes not going to attack  goldilocks youre up  stefanie so the farthest i can move to get close to them is so ill use my movement and get as  close to them as possible  sam you can get right up to the edge of the ship  stefanie so my thunderwave is only in a 15foot cube but theyre not in it  sam you would not be able to hit any of them /none/ with thunderwave  stefanie now that im here facing them  amy i feel like thunderwave has a range  sam its 15 feet from self  stefanie so its not going to get them  h michael does it have to land on the square or is it the distance in between because if you went  diagonally you could go  sam it would not do it  h michael okay i dont know anything im just asking  stefanie no scarecrow  sam do you have anything if you cannot strike or use your action to attack /none/ you can also hold your  action and say i hold my action until they are in range  stefanie yeah im going to hold my action  sam okay so youre going to attack them when they get closer all right great that ends your  turn next up is tootles so he is crying tears are streaming down tootles face he turns and  runs runs in fear trying to get as far away from you as possible hes freaked out  molly to clarify are they kids are they children because were adults  sam theyre the /none/ lost boys straight from neverland  noelle were definitely adults though right  molly peter pan is definitely over 18 years old  sam for sure yes  molly but the lost boys are children  sam these are children they are 11 and 12 years old actually its going to be peters turn next  so you notice something about the boys something seems different about them they were always  roughandtumble kids but now they seem deranged filthy dirty wild hair and eyes with ripped  clothing no shoes to speak of some of them are missing teeth /none/  noelle okay so wheres the closest area that i can get to that has some barrels a stack of  barrels anything that i can go behind but be fairly close  sam let me paint a picture for you actually roll a perception check because you just came out  on this  noelle not great 11  sam thats okay youre right next to stuff these are masts this is the place on the ship  where you steer  laughter  sam the helm  yuri helm makes sense well call it a helm and get /none/ torn apart by boat enthusiasts  sam its a raised platform there are some lockers over here boxes and crates over here you  also seem to notice there are two ballistae that can fire things and there are two cannons over here  noelle so how far away am i from this ballista  sam you are it looks like 35ish feet from this one and maybe a little less to that one 30 feet  maybe  noelle so whats this red thing here  sam that you notice is a gangplank thats what they use to load /none/ and unload the ship at port its  a long ladder very long and it unfolds to about 15 feet long  noelle i dont see much of a use for that  yuri you dont usually get to the gangplank until later in the night oh thats right im sorry  that was something totally different sorry  amy oh my  h michael your enjoyment of that joke was as good if not better than the joke  noelle okay i will let those two do their thing can i make it to this mast nearby the ballista /none/  sam yeah you can swing around to here  noelle im going to go over there and kind of hide behind it and im going to shoot a message  cantrip at the closest boy  sam okay that i believe is slightly yes slightly  noelle okay so i shoot a message cantrip im like yo dude what the fuck like shrug emoji  fire emoji explosion emoji skull and crossbones emoji its me peter by the way  sam so he hears in his ears magically peters voice saying to him what gives whats going  on /none/ and he replies to you because he can do that with message right yeah not massage he replies  by saying you hear in your ear if we cant have wendy no one can  noelle oh fuck  sam all right anything else youd like to do for your turn  noelle can i do anything else for my turn  sam i dont know bonus action or something  molly i think you can say something  noelle i did with my message  sam all right well thats your turn itll go to twin number two who /none/ doesnt have a name hes  going to roll very well and do his sling at you goldilocks this is a ooh its a 20 it  definitely hits and it hits with five points of damage sorry lady  stefanie i guess we cant use our shield again  sam sure you can use shield as a reaction right  stefanie yeah  sam is it once per whats it say  stefanie oh wait im not going to use my shield because then i cant use my thunderwave  right i can only use three per day and /none/ i dont know how long this night is going to go so i will  take damage so i can kill them later  molly are you saying all this in character  stefanie thats what im doing  sam mark five points off your health  yuri i thought i was crazy what is she talking about  sam twin number two is going to run down to this cannon and continue to load it that brings us  to peter went already right so now its all the fours wendy queen and the hatter who wants  to /none/ go first  yuri sure  molly what  sam lets move this along the ship has now come closer and moved around to here theyre preparing  to fire  stefanie does goldilocks get her prepared action  sam yes yes they are now within range thank you fellow dm go ahead and do your attack what  was your attack  stefanie it was the thunderwave  sam and who would you like to target  stefanie them  sam so you can probably hit both of these fellows  stefanie i mean 15 feet where is that /none/ guy  sam its a 15foot cube so  stefanie what about this back one here starting from there  i mean i feel bad  sam dont feel bad theyre children  stefanie can i try talking to them first  sam no you cant talk to them because you were holding your action this is all you can do  stefanie all right ill thunderwave  sam out of goldilocks she opens her mouth and a loud thunderous sound cracks out of her mouth  making a blast of thunder that hurts everybodys ears  stefanie what the /none/ fuck are you doing youre destroying our love boat cruise  sam its piercing and they roll fail one of them succeeds one of them fails thunderwave is  what 2d8 is that right  stefanie yeah 2d8  sam so roll 2d8 do that roll it again youre going to add these together  stefanie two  sam okay so thats four points of damage  stefanie im going to use my lucky and reroll i get lucky three times per day  sam sure you can reroll one of those  stefanie two again  sam so they /none/ both take four points of damage and this one is sent ten feet back all right  excellent job let me mark off their damage okay next is curly right hes the one who hasnt  gone have they all  stefanie curly hasnt  sam hes this one right shit i cant remember they all look alike hes going to roll and attack  you goldilocks because you just attacked one of his friends  h michael you should have given them its like anime rules everybody needs a different color hair  sam i didnt make these god /none/ damn minis  h michael theyre all basically drawn the same so someones got half a face  sam hes just rolled a 19 he hits you  stefanie yeah i use my shield now  sam you do thats plus five to ac right so he does not hit he slings a rock at you it barely  misses you and clatters across the deck of the ship you are fine queen of hearts and hatter  have to go have you gone yet how did i skip wendy oh okay  noelle theyre all equally shitty at rolling /none/  yuri thank you thank you  noelle youre welcome  amy it sounds like theres so much happening up there i run up the stairs look around and see  where all the action is if i can get to at least the edge of the boat im at 30foot speed  sam you took ten feet to get up there so you can get right about there  amy okay awesome i yell at them mommys home  sam as soon as you say mommys home the closest one to you nibs smiles and says  mommy  /none/ stefanie goldilocks mutters this is fucked up  noelle this is fucked up  sam as youre all on deck now you notice the chaos and carnage around you your vessel is not  designed for fighting and has suffered badly two of its three masts are broken the deck is riddled  with holes its on fire in one place  noelle am i in the fire  sam i will draw you fire where is it ah wheres my pens fuck it this is on fire over  here this is fire this mast is gone this mast /none/ is damaged  noelle just really immerse us in the situation  all oh wow  h michael the waters on fire  stefanie is scarecrow freaking out

beast  noelle are beauty and the beast alive  sam you dont see actually roll a perception check  noelle i want to look for the beast i /none/ got a one i dont see him  sam okay anyone else want to take a look  h michael you blink while you look  sam and you got another two awesome okay you guys look around for the beast anywhere in sight  you do not see the beast  noelle i did forget to open my eyes  sam you goldilocks do notice that theres a lifeboat right here but it has been severely  damaged in the attack there is no lifeboat right there some of the crew had light weapons theyre  scattered around the /none/ ground theres also these weapon lockers over here that have different  things in them okay top of the round  amy these two  sam sorry sorry you havent gone yet sorry i keep skipping you go ahead go ahead  molly do you have something  yuri go go go  molly wendy steps forward seeing the lost boys and rolling her eyes especially at the one who  was like mom and shes like let me see if i can remember how to do this and she turns into a  giant eagle  sam oh shit /none/ that is so cool  molly she spreads massive wings shes a large beast which is very big maybe not quite as big  as a dragon but  amy ive never been less attracted to you  noelle an eagle as big as a dragon  molly its a big eagle and she flaps over shes trying to basically grab the boy whos on the  cannon and put him into the water  sam so you can fly over there i dont think that you can also grab you can get over there and turn  into  /none/ molly its an action youre right yeah totally  yuri their reaction to this should be shitting their pants  molly i use my action to turn into a huge eagle and hover over the boat my wings blowing air in  everybodys faces  noelle youre doing so good sam this is awesome  exclamations  molly i really want one of those birds that you can balance on your finger and i could just hold it  noelle oh no shes dead now  molly im drowning  noelle shes fine again  sam youre floating above them /none/ probably not that high either but whatever its done okay thats  your action and your movement are you good  molly thats it thats all i got  yuri i think i might be able to do it from where i am but if not i might be able to get closer i  would like to try to sleep some of them because thats what i do im boring im going to sing  them a lullaby and sleep as many as i can its 90 feet  sam absolutely sure yeah go ahead and roll what is /none/ it 5d8 to find out how many hit points  of sleep you cause is that how it works shit  yuri yeah 5d8 total is how many hit points where are my d8s at  sam guys by the way little legal note here yuri is portraying a character tonight called the  hatter hes not portraying a character called anything other than the hatter which would be  property of disney  noelle i wouldnt know of any other character known as the hatter  sam hes the crazy hat  h michael hes the goofball capwearer  /none/ sam yeah because were all on the ss public domain guys  yuri 24  sam 24 points of hit points you can pick four of those guys to sleep  yuri how about the four that are closest to me  sam where are you you havent moved so thats these four  yuri the ones that are closest to me physically me the person who is not the hatter but who is  also the hatter  sam so they all fall asleep thats how sleep works theres no save  h michael fucking fantastic  sam right /none/ thats how that works  yuri sure yeah  sam theyre all within 20 feet of each other i think thats how it works i dont care thats  how it works great okay that was amazing hatter that was amazing  yuri thank you sometimes  noelle i know i am attracted to all of you  yuri i didnt even have to use charm person on you  sam okay you notice that four of the lost boys get all sleepyeyed and curl up into a little  fetal position and go to sleep nightnight time  amy /none/ a tiny man who is good with children  sam okay that brings us to the top of the round right no one is awake to fire their cannons so  they do not but the one who is left whos actually up a bit on lookout hes one of the  twins he yells to you wendy wendy mama we miss you come back to neverland ever since you  and peter broke up weve nobody to take care of us we dont know how to cook bathe brush our  teeth were getting sick curly has the runs /none/ you also notice that above the twin on that mast  is captain hooks severed head stuck to the top of the mast a gruesome effigy of the madness that  has befallen the boys the ship is still moving a bit its drifting because the guy who was  piloting it is now asleep just then you realize that your ship is starting to list severely to one  side the waterline has shifted one of the injured sailors calls out oh gods were  sinking what would you like to do were at the top of the round /none/ its scarecrows turn  stefanie remember when you said you were super absorbent  h michael thats a good point i think weve got to take this fucking ship most of them are either  scared or sleeping right  sam yeah  h michael okay i have an action an attack and 40 feet of movement right  sam correct you can jump you can use your action not just to attack but you can do things  use objects  h michael okay so this is 15 feet this ladder  sam yes  h michael so im /none/ going to hit this ladder shove it straight out and try to get it to briefly dock  onto the other ship  sam okay roll a strength check  h michael lets see 16 plus two 18  sam fuck yeah you knock it and it goes clatter its stretching its skidding across  their deck because their ship is still moving a little bit in relation to yours but there is a  temporary bridge there that you can use  amy you are two for two for applause on your dd turns  h michael okay and /none/ so i want to get this guy out of commission so i use my movement to move right  to the ledge of their ship i cross the bridge and i land right on the bridge of their ship and i  look up at the man at the top  sam hes a boy hes a tiny child  h michael the boy in the crows nest and i stick my fingers in my mesh face and i pull it sideways  and i scream up at him and i use my menace again on him  sam okay /none/ great that is an action you roll versus insight  h michael 12 plus five 17  sam 17 he rolls a natural 20 you try to make him go berserk and he looks down at you but  through the cannon smoke and the chaos he cant even really get a good glimpse of you so it just fails  molly there is a severed head on the mast too  h michael yeah thats a good point  noelle i cant feel anything anymore  h michael my scary mask face isnt worse  yuri the dudes seen /none/ some shit  h michael also the drawing of my character is the sweetest fucking guy youve ever seen  noelle oh man i sure wish that i was watching this right now so i could see that that must be  so great  h michael well maybe someday youll be able to look it up in order to make it harder for this  guy to attack me im going to move right up against the pole im going to move pressed up  against it so the ability for him to shoot something down at me is /none/ a tough angle  yuri were still being romantic in this you just pressed yourself up against his pole  h michael ill fuck anything man  sam i dont have another platform but oh jesus oh forget it just imagine hes up a bit  noelle oh wait  sam look at that what on earth  noelle is that high enough  sam yes maam okay thats your turn scarecrow next is goldilocks  stefanie i am so impressed by a guy who takes charge even though he has no idea what hes doing  and ends up /tavern/ being really really sweet to the rest of us so were going to go in were going to  move as close as we can to  sam the bridge  stefanie yeah i assume i dont have my weapons on me i

child  molly can i flap over and grab him not attacking for damage but just yank him  sam sure like a grapple all right so wendybird flies over and grabs the child roll  for /none/ a grapple  molly can he get disadvantage because hes dangling  sam of course hes got one arm and hes using the other to hold on  molly damn i only got a nine i am very strong though  noelle do you want to borrow some dice  molly i got nine  sam you know what you roll with advantage instead of him rolling with disadvantage  molly 11  sam sure thats enough hes like this youre a giant eagle you pick him up you have

/none/ fire  streaks across the ship striking the child dead in the heart he looks stunned for a second and  then collapses dead or at least severely unconscious right there  h michael can i do a reaction here based on the fact that he just shot fire by a giant stack of hay  sam sure what reaction  h michael i turn to the hatter and go what the fuck man what the fuck are you thinking do  you not know any nonflammable spells im in the line of fire dude i thought we were cool /none/  yuri i squirt water out of my boutonniere on you  sam that was the hatter queen of hearts youve gone wendys

i wasnt ever feeling like i wanted to be a mom but upon seeing a child get killed my  maternal instincts kick in and im like youre a horrible human being or hatter of the crazy  variety and so i dont

is crossing in front  of you you have an attack of opportunity you can hit him as he goes if youd like /none/ to or grab him  molly you can choose to deal subdual damage which knocks him unconscious  stefanie yeah i would like to not kill the child that would definitely  sam okay roll for an attack  h michael were getting so much shit for just killing one one imaginary kid  stefanie 18  sam as he runs by panicked breathing he gets hit in the back of the head falls down also  unconscious  stefanie and i say its safer for you this way  sam down but not dead  yuri the hatter cant /none/ get you

noelle im going to get some of those coils of rope and im /none/ going to toss it to the hatter and  im going to use my bardic inspiration to give him 1d6 to any ability check he might try to make  sam okay so peter pan either speaks or sings or plays  noelle singing hang on dude i got you  sam the words are so inspiring that you get an extra d6 dice that you can add on to your next  roll

bonus action  yuri misty step is actually a bonus action can i use my bonus action first  sam yes  yuri and im closer than 30 feet away so i would like to misty step aboard the deck which is sort  of

of the night  sam looking thankfully gratefully into peter pans eyes  h michael mickey fucking kicks through this right over here oh i said mickey  noelle shh dont let the mouse hear you  h michael

very faintly breathing his pulse is almost at a standstill someone else would have  to do something very quickly in order to save him  h michael can anyone act here  sam anyone can act yes were out of battle  noelle i start playing my pan pipes beautifully and seeing as it is a short rest any friends that  hear my performance they regain /none/ 1d6 hp  sam okay so youre playing a jaunty ditty or a

but if she wanted to  get back together you know i would be okay with that but if not i would also be okay with that  sam are you saying that theres a chance you might be able to get back together  noelle look i have lots of other options  molly our relationship fell apart because we had seven tiny grubby children hanging on to us at  all times im not ready to be a mom  sam so it was our fault crying  /none/ molly yes it was  stefanie i interject and say hey i think thats a really bad foundation for six or seven kids  however many were on this boat  molly i keep losing track  stefanie on a side note lets direct our attention elsewhere i want to roll a perception  check to see if i feel like the lifeboat was taken by someone who mightve known this attack  was coming so i roll a 16  sam thats great as you glance back to the old ss public domain you catch the final glimpses  /none/ of the stern of it as it vanishes beneath the water sunken  h michael wow that means a lot of people died  sam debris litters the open ocean but not a single survivor is visible you do spot way in  the distance a small lifeboat carrying a large figure furiously paddling away from the wreckage  you also notice that the helm of the jolly roger is spinning back and forth pilotless your vessel  is drifting aimlessly in the water you have no direction what would you like to do  noelle i want to go /none/ drive it at the lifeboat  sam so peters going to go up to the helm take it and roll a survival check please  noelle can i get advantage since ive probably steered a boat before  sam sure youve stolen advantage why not  noelle yeah thats fine i dont do it probably  sam well what did you roll  noelle that is a nine  sam sure man you straighten out the boat thats it you are going straight  noelle i got this dont worry guys  h michael i want to check out the /none/ captains quarters i walk over to the door to the captains  quarters and i open it i do a fucking lookaround check  sam do an investigation check noelle will you point to investigation on his page  h michael plus zero cool 20 i see fucking everything  sam yes you do natural 20 okay great so you look around the room any sign of food or clothing  has been picked clean also a lot of the paper has been ruined it seems like theyve been using  some of the navigational maps to wipe their ass /none/ after they go number two so a lot of the paper is  gone you do find  yuri not so sad that i killed one of them now huh  sam you find one piece of paper that looks really interesting but its all ripped up to shreds  exclamations  h michael ive got to do a puzzle  sam its in two pieces oh shit that parts all together thank you  noelle wait is this one of the ones they used to wipe their asses or what  yuri ill help you help us  sam /none/ it is definitely covered in fecal matter one fell on the floor  h michael youre doing great as a dm but stop throwing the puzzle pieces on the ground okay  sam sorry also h you find a couple of items in there  h michael oh sick are they guns i dont know whats wrong with me  sam you find these two things in the ship peter as you are steering the ship you notice that if  you were to turn about 30 degrees to the right you might be able to intercept that lifeboat  /none/ noelle oh i do that  sam roll another survival check with advantage  noelle ooh thats much better that is a 29 on that  sam so you definitely pilot the craft easily and as you approach the lifeboat you see the large  form of the beast furiously paddling away from the action what would you like to do  noelle im going to use my firebolt to blow a hole in his ship  sam you are going to attack the beast  noelle yeah im going to fucking attack the beast  sam sure sure sure /none/  noelle only his boat im aiming at his boat  sam yeah go ahead roll for an attack  noelle so thats a lot thats 21  sam you definitely hit the ship roll for damage on the boat this is a boat not a ship i know  sailing terms  stefanie is belle anywhere to be seen  sam belle does not exist beauty exists the public domain character  stefanie do we see beauty  yuri but as you say belle the hunchback goes no  sam you do not see beauty anywhere  noelle okay /none/ so that is a seven  sam okay the front of his lifeboat explodes with magical fire you definitely got his attention he  turns to you and says oh oh are you not a pirate oh please save me please save me we  were being attacked  noelle i throw him the rope that i was going to throw at the hatter until he misty stepped out of it  sam it takes a couple of minutes but he uses the boat to climb up and get onto the deck with you i  guess you found the /none/ scarecrow and youre helping him put this puzzle back together  amy yes and at any moment i get a chance i brush my fingers across the hatters fingers and  i pretend that nothing is happening  h michael i look over and i see the queen of hearts using my move on another guy and a single  dry dusty tear rolls down my face  sam im just perceiving that i think some of your pieces go to his and his go to yours  yuri okay thats why this was so goddamn hard  sam they /none/ must have gotten mixed up my bag  noelle oh boy  sam dont worry it will be great the beast approaches peter and wendy and goldilocks who are  standing on the deck and says oh am i pleased to see you lot let me assure you that you will  all be given refunds from the storybook love singles cruise limited liability corporation in  the form of credits you can use on future cruises are the pirates alive are we okay are we safe  stefanie did you kill beauty were you done with that relationship  /none/ sam what are you talking about did i kill i dont have a pirate ship  stefanie where is your wife  sam i dont know i left her at the ship

to use this spell very well  sam no thats okay let me find the beasts stats you said 14 was your and its versus  charisma saving throw okay what did you say it was  noelle 14  sam as you cast the spell he looks at you oddly his eyes seem to shrink back for a moment and  then he looks at you again harder and says what are you trying to do to me it does not work  molly are we /none/ all in the zone of truth area because i think its an area effect so are we all  affected by it  noelle yes you are  molly the range is 60 feet so we have to roll a charisma saving throw right  sam yes charisma saving throw i love how i accidentally got rid of half of our players  sorry guys  yuri i love puzzles sam  amy this is very important  noelle wait wait  sam wait what  noelle does this count if i can use my jack of all trades to /none/ add half my proficiency bonus to my  ability check does that count as an ability check  sam no it does not you cannot add it to a spellcasting ability  stefanie i want to roll a perception check on beast  sam just an insight check right okay roll a d20 and add your insight to that  stefanie 18 plus  sam yeah you got it you can tell that he is not telling you the whole story  stefanie can i ask him questions  sam sure you can ask him a question  stefanie was /none/ your relationship troubled before this cruise  sam unfortunately yes it was troubled before the cruise i was looking at this voyage as a way  to mend our broken bonds we have been spending a lot of time apart and actually this is the first  cruise that shes agreed to come on in a long time i was hoping  h michael holy fuck you guys  yuri we just found out why  h michael we put together a bunch of shitty pieces of shit paper and its a letter it says  dear captain and then /none/ were missing a piece soon we can be together and we can play hooky  all night long love beauty i have no idea what that means you guys  sam and noelle you can read  h michael i mean i know basic sounds im not gonna add fucking meaning to them  noelle they are colorcoded  molly wendy was affected by the zone of truth spell and she just leans in to the beast and  shes like sounds like your dead wife was cheating on you  sam i suspected as much i thought she was /none/ cheating on me but i thought that we could  reconcile our differences i had no idea who it was i had no idea it was captain jeremy hook  molly he gets around  stefanie wait no his head is on a mast  sam where  stefanie right there  sam oh my god  stefanie it wasnt him i assure you he was there during the whole attack  sam he did not attack our vessel  stefanie no the kids did  molly that head used to kiss your dead wifes face  sam oh god /none/  stefanie wait are we sure about that  h michael we are missing a piece  amy she did use the clever pun hooky  h michael yeah but you dont know who it is its captain and then the initial is missing  sam the beast vomits over the side of the deck  yuri but she did say play hooky that is sort of a  amy lets say i were to flirt with captain hook i would make the exact same joke  sam the beast just vomited you can see his skin is ashen he /none/ drops to his knees and starts sobbing  into his hands  noelle i would like to use detect thoughts on the beast  sam all right let me find out how that works okay i will see ive got to roll against that  you are marking off all your spells right  noelle i am yes  sam sure you are  yuri we should totally firebolt the beast  noelle that is a cantrip so i can have many of those i didnt choose very useful spells for my  toptier spells  sam okay yes so /none/ you hear a voice inside your head that is not your own voice its the beasts  voice the beast is saying to himself my god i cant believe after all these years she was  cheating on me with him hes such a fucking asshole the way he parades around with his big  ship and his little helper man smee what a fucking asshole i should have killed him when i  had the chance thats all you hear  noelle interesting  sam if you would like to probe deeper you can  noelle ill do that /none/ how do i do that  sam as an action you just say i want to probe deeper your spell dc is 14  h michael right as shes about to probe deeper i shove peter pan to the ground  noelle hey what the fuck man  h michael my face is wild i suddenly say did you make fun of me for not being able to read i  dont like it when people call me stupid  noelle i would never do that man i respect you i was just stating a fact that the note is /none/  colorcoded and its a beautiful note you did that you put that back together you did such a  good job  h michael okay just dont anybody ever fucking do that okay  noelle i would never  h michael dont ever fucking do that  noelle im also not that smart i understand  molly its true  h michael i take a break i go to the other side of the ship and i lean over the edge and  hyperventilate  noelle hang in there buddy i believe in you  sam peter right before /none/ he pushed you you had heard the beast say in his interior monologue  you had heard him say i know what i must do now and it will be glorious and thats all you  heard before scarecrow pushed you over  molly how long does zone of truth last for  noelle who else was in it  sam well no ones asking you anything  stefanie what am i rolling charisma  sam just roll a d20 add your charisma save  stefanie 14  sam her spell dc is 14 right so that affects you so /none/ you have to tell the truth if someone  talks to you for the next minute  noelle so it says that it is a 15foot radius and until the spell ends a creature that enters the  spells area for the first oh for the first time never mind forget it i had an idea but it  didnt work its fine  molly scarecrow has to roll too  sam just roll a d20 add your charisma save see if you are telling the truth which whispering  he always is guys  h michael 15  noelle /none/ scarecrow passed  sam okay the crisis is averted calm settles over the ship so you found the thing beast is  crying what would you guys like to do youre drifting at sea  amy i go up to the scarecrow who seems alone i put my arm around you i say did i detect a  showing of strength back there  h michael i just dont like it when people say that im dumb  amy but you did stand up for yourself  h michael yeah im getting tired of this ship  amy well might /none/ i say that i did not expect that to come from a pile of straw and refuse  h michael thank you i put my hand over her hand onto her shoulder and i nod my shoulder and i look  out at the ocean  stefanie and then i come up because im in the zone of truth im like and i have to say i  thought that was really hot  laughter  sam i love it the beast composes himself wipes the tears from his face and says i dont know  what to do now /none/ but we must get to a port from the looks of this vessel we dont have any  provisions we cant possibly go back the way we came the trade winds will itll take days

something with these disgusting children all about  yuri its called pleasure island yes yes well go  noelle yeah no question why dont you /none/ go take a nap and well drive the ship to pleasure island  sam all right  noelle wendy i got to talk to you  molly peter it just seems like we cant escape our past no matter where we go  laughter  molly we have so much history together  noelle that is true im actually trying to talk about something else here for the first time  ever  molly in the form of six or maybe seven grubby children our history keeps coming back to us  noelle this is specific to our backstory and /none/ not the other fairytale characters on this cruises  backstory and that is convenient because i have read up on it  molly what do you need to tell me  noelle the beast is

letting myself feel pleasure because of what that might mean  like what do /none/ you think that says about me  yuri how does that make you feel wendy  molly i think youre all wrapped up in your own thing think about someone else for one minute  all the rest of us want to go to pleasure island  noelle i think that this all has something to do with my core wound i think that i really not  having a mother need some stability in my life you know and you took that away from me what the hell  yuri did wendy take that away from you or did /none/ you take that away from yourself  molly that one no that one  noelle wendy was the one who did it  molly no listen to our therapist  noelle well he said both things he didnt just say one thing he said both things and i chose one  molly but always when they say two things in that way the second thing is always the right  answer  noelle is that true this is the first time ive done therapy when do you get to sleep with the  therapist i dont understand  yuri youll /none/ get to sleep with the therapist in minute six of our seven minutes in heaven dont  worry  noelle oh how many minutes in are we are we rolling initiative right now  molly i wish that you would grow up a little bit because we have so much past and we have such good  chemistry and we could have a really lovely relationship but you always act like a child  h michael outside the door ive taken a piece of straw and ive slipped it in the door and ive  frilled out the end of /none/ it to create a little speaker phone and ive invited the two ladies to  lean in and listen in  sam beast is also there  amy i think theyre fucking  sam beast knocks on the door and says all right six minutes left  noelle we could have sex like 13 times right now  sam just kidding one minute left try to wrap it up  noelle oh okay wow ive got to fit 13 times into one minute  yuri but okay guys we could either spend our last minute fucking or we could try /none/ to deal with  your problems at the core  noelle i grab the hatter and i kiss him on the mouth  sam oh do you resist  yuri snorts no  sam all right the kiss is long  noelle wendy this is what youve done to me and i kiss him again  sam the waifish peter pan grabs the tiny weirdlooking halfling hatter and plants a long  hard kiss on him he does not resist instead he wraps his arms around peters waist and brings him  in closer tongues are slipped it goes on /none/ for an uncomfortable 12 seconds and then breaks  yuri wendy how does that make you feel  molly like slightly aroused in a weird way that i dont maybe want to address yeah fuck it and  i kiss the hatter as well  sam oh do you resist  yuri no  sam all right another equally long kiss descends into some light necking and earnibbling  wendy is taller than the hatter so she has to scoop down to get to him  h michael listening in i go im just going to put it out there /none/ should we also all be making out  amy i grapple him  sam grapple him okay roll an attack  amy okay and i have a feat that makes me i can restrain you if im grappling you  h michael as she does this i go im just posing a question  amy okay not bad a 12  sam roll a strength save  h michael okay strength save three  sam no you definitely grab him and can do with him as you please  amy okay so he said should we all be making out /none/ and i am i think a little thirsty so i  basically take my big muscly arm and i almost clothesline him its like this kakunk and i  awkwardly place myself on top of him and thats what it is im not very experienced in this  h michael i go hold on hold on i gather up some fabric and i tie it off with a bit of twine  to create sort of a phallus  sam yeah because hes just straw theres nothing down there  h michael i gather it up  stefanie okay goldilocks /none/ turns to beast and says is this what you wanted  sam no no this is not what i wanted this is an exploration of love please please we dont  amy i look as scared as this  sam queen i admire your romantic instincts but this is not the time or place to  h michael what are you doing man  sam im uncomfortable theres other people in the room im trying to create a safe space here  amy oh im so sorry  sam if you guys want to pursue this im not going to /none/ stop you but please find a stateroom  somewhere to do this in private please  amy this isnt what you meant  h michael im so on board  sam why dont you retire you guys can take the captains quarters if youd like but not right  here were at the bottom of a foot of stairs next to a kitchen and were all watching you its  kind of gross  amy at that moment when he gets all intense i go orgasm sounds and i roll off him and i have  a big sigh  /none/ sam did you oh boy  molly not a family show  sam oh god  h michael i give the beast a look like all right man and then i head to the end of the ship  sam sorry i didnt know im sorry  h michael no no hey i hope that really renewed your belief in love is that what you were looking for  sam i was but that did not come anywhere close to renewing  h michael and then i go im glad and then i book it  sam the beast starts /none/ crying again  yuri it did come close though  sam all right

it im a druid im in touch with nature  sam the rest of you are following the beast hes saying right up this way keep up up ahead  the jungle has grown very dense its dark in here almost like nightfall because theres no sun  overhead youre drawn to the dim red glow of a building its not lit by torches or anything like  that this red glow comes from inside the building and shines faintly through the walls the cracks  the windows everything /none/ has this red glowing hue to it youre also met with a powerful pungent  odor the strong warm scents of candy chocolate vanilla ginger and apple caramel and sugar  nougat even custard as you draw closer you see why this building is actually a massive  gingerbread house the beast explains we inherited the house from hansel may he rest in  peace and gretels witch she donated it to the company after we found ehr a husband nice guy named gary  their wedding was really sweet anyway well find help inside my people are in there /none/ as you get  closer an arrow whizzes by peter pans head another arrow shoots by the scarecrows head and  impacts in a tree next to the queen the beast calls up ahead oh no hold your fire these are  friends he turns to you all and says you know what wait here at the door let me go inside and  make sure nothing dangerous happens they werent expecting us until late today so theyre probably  on edge we have new security that weve hired let me go in and make sure everythings all  right /none/ he disappears into a large wooden door slams it behind him what would you like to do  stefanie can i roll a

walls  making it hard to identify much as you get closer you see the source of the light a large  20foot long track in the center of the room red with glowing blistering embers it is the hot  coal path warmth emanates across the room /none/ on the opposite side of the room over here these guys  over here are ice sculptures three ice sculptures lets see here whos closest  goldilocks make a quick perception check  stefanie i roll a 14 plus anything  sam thats fine thatll do it their faces are in agony but theyve been positioned together in  a way that makes them look like theyre locked in romantic poses  stefanie the ice sculptures  noelle fuck  sam then you see four more ice sculptures or no theyre not complete glowing with purple  magical energy you /none/ see that they are living human beings in various stages of being frozen you  recognize the frozen face of robin hood weak and exhausted baba yaga and theres gepetto his  lower half frozen solid stepping out from the back room is a large hulking blue creature this  is him right here boop with icy eyes and icicles hanging off his hands he is laughing to himself  he opens his mouth and projects ice breath onto baba yaga she screams in agony you also see lit  by the glowing embers the beast standing casually behind the /none/ fiery coal pathway hes holding  something its a face he is roasting the severed head of captain hook over the intense heat of the  coals he calmly takes a bite out of it like an apple hes muttering to himself never laughed  at my jokes always embarrassed me and now this he looks up at you and sees you because you are in  plain sight and says oh hello oops youve caught me hi yes this whole thing has been my  doing beauty filed for divorce a while ago leaving me no choice but to /none/ send her to the bottom  of the sea and now to learn that she was cheating on me with hook it proves me right on behalf of  the storybook love cruise line i formally apologize for sinking your ship sorry

jack frost over there weve started a new business changing you ugly love birds into  beautiful statues my wife turned my heart to ice and now i will do the same to every lover i meet  go ahead and roll for initiative as he roars at you furiously  amy as he does that i look at my new friends and i say to them i dont know what exactly hes  talking /none/ about but i have to admit that ive

scarecrow  and queen of hearts who wants to go first  h michael i defer to the /none/ lady  amy i say that thing that i said and then i look at beast and i say thats right i fantasized  about every single one of these people and i am not leaving this island until i find my king and  i rage with sceptre in hand my knuckles glowing white with rage as i grip with all of my force i  definitely move towards him as much as i can thats 30 and i dont actually have dash but i  could use my action to move double speed  sam sure you can /none/ get closer to him but you wont be able to attack  amy that is fine  sam you get right up do you want to go around the coals  amy no right through them  sam right through them you get right up to the coals roll a dexterity save  amy come on i have advantage on dex saves if i can see it which i can thats pretty cool oh  yay 17  sam okay good are you resistant to anything  amy i do have resistance but not to fire  sam you take /none/ two points of fire damage as you start to run into the coals you are within range  he attacks you with his spear hes going to throw a spear at you  amy okay  sam he only rolled a seven his spear flies away from him and clatters across the stone ground  yuri into a reeses peanut butter cup  sam yes scarecrow its your turn  h michael heres a question i wanted to come to the side because i wanted the element of surprise  but now im the first to go so is there /none/ a way to hold until the ice boy has his back completely  turned to me  sam his back is to you right now hes not looking out the window  h michael does that give me an advantage  sam well he wont see you he may hear you as you crash through the window  h michael that makes sense  sam you wont be able to do anything from outside  h michael right oh im still outside  sam youre trying to get in you tried on the last roll and it didnt work  /none/ h michael do i have room for an action and an attack to try to break the glass or is that  considered an attack  sam you can use your action to break the glass sure  h michael so ill try to break the glass  sam sure go for it  h michael oh shit four  sam you rolled a four  h michael

one of my darts on ice guy from the outside  sam okay wait those were your actions  h michael okay so that was my confusion because i thought action and attack were different  sam action can be either attack or doing something significant /none/ like trying to break a  window but you need to get in there so you did good you have your straw points that you can use  if you really wanted to  h michael i cant do much from outside you know what im going to do for the rest of my turn  ill move one block over out of sight so you cant attack  sam youre staying outside just out of range  h michael the window is slightly broken but im going to move slightly over  sam jack frost turns around and hears /none/ something but doesnt see you great that was your turn  second turn is jack frost he does not see scarecrow so instead hes going to move right  past peter pan who is this pack of smarties not noticing him hes going to attack with his ice  breath against you two shit shit shit frost breath wendy and mad hatter  amy im up by beast on the coals  sam yeah  yuri we were holding hands now were not  sam make a dexterity saving throw  yuri you raged i understand  stefanie and yuri /none/ 18  sam you both dodge out of most of the frosty blasts range you only take two points of damage  and you feel a chill come across you as ice coats your eyebrows and makes you all shivery  h michael thats the worst you guys  sam that is his action and his movement and thats it for him next is peter pan what would  you like to do  noelle how far am i from mr beast over there  sam far  noelle how far  sam like 40 50 feet  noelle okay /none/ is it 40 or 50 this is important  sam okay 55  noelle 55 well  sam its a big ass room  noelle its a big ass room im going to use my jump spell to go 48 feet  sam 48 feet oh because its your  noelle with a tenfoot head start im going to use jump across the room  sam as soon as this thing of gumdrops starts moving it jumps across i think disguise self is  concentration  noelle yeah it is  sam so you lose concentration and in midair turns /none/ into a sort of flying peter pan it kind of  looks like hes flying he does a cool spin move and he lands right here next to the beast  noelle so i did that now im here and thats all cool and good i have an action left yeah  sam no that was your action and your movement you have a bonus action i dont know what you can  do as bonus  noelle im unfamiliar with playing a bard  sam bonus actions are usually healing things for bards you can inspire someone  noelle /none/ who else is over here the queen of hearts is over here i will use my bardic inspiration to  give the queen of hearts an extra 1d6 to an ability check  sam peter looks over at you with fire burning in his sort of handsome small man eyes he looks so  hot and sexy that the queen shudders and swoons and gets an extra d6 to her next roll the next up  is the beast hes going to turn to you peter and take his first attack rolled a natural one he  bites at you /none/ but youre so small and fast that he misses  yuri and bites his cheek by accident it hurts  h michael 45 damage hes dead  sam he takes his claw at you rolls a seven and it takes a chuff of hot coals and he misses you  that is his turn hes going to move though hes going to move no hes not scared of you fuckers  hes not going to move at all hes going to stay there and roar at you roars thats his move  thats the beast next is goldilocks  stefanie /none/ im going to ask wendy what is the damage of your amy vorpahl sword  molly you want it i cant really use swords  stefanie

dualwielding  stefanie i move towards jack frost and then /none/ i use my longsword attack but onehanded with the  longsword so i can use the vorpahl sword on the other hand  sam im gonna have to say that you used your bonus action to catch that sword so you get one attack  this round youll get two next round  stefanie okay so then i can only do one attack  sam one attack this round and youre holding two swords so it is a onehanded attack  stefanie so just with one hand not two  sam yes you do have some bonus surgey thing i /none/ think  stefanie i have an action surge where i get one extra action per day  sam so you could have two hits if you want  stefanie ill do that where i use the action surge  sam action surge against jack frost roll twice  stefanie roll twice so this one is for the longsword its a 13 plus five  sam you definitely hit  stefanie and now we use please be lucky five plus two seven  sam you can use luck to reroll that right arent you lucky  stefanie i can  amy /none/ thats a pretty good roll  stefanie well keep that seven  sam wait what did you oh thats damage okay seven points great thank you  stefanie seven points damage and now whats the vorpahl

frost hershey bar jack frost gets two the beast gets one  sam i think you roll a melee attack  yuri its a ranged attack  sam its a ranged attack so roll a d20 and add your this thing plus four  yuri nine i /none/ mean i have to roll for each one  sam okay roll two more times  yuri so the beast doesnt get hit at all  sam the first one misses the beast and starts melting the chocolate wall here  yuri you know im still kind of okay with that  amy im very impressed  yuri so 12  sam thats against the beast  yuri no these last two are against jack frost  sam jack frost that hits jack frost roll for damage  yuri great and that i looked it up and i forget and /tavern/ its  sam i might have it here somewhere  yuri 2d6 nine and then there is a second ray  sam as you fire against jack frost he opens his mouth to blast you with ice but your fire bolt  enters his mouth and his head explodes killing him instantly jack frost is dead  yuri that happened  sam where would you like to attack next  yuri i get another attack  sam well its three bolts right  yuri yeah well the beast again no the hershey bar no the beast you know what the /tavern/ mad hatter  would attack the hershey bar  sam the hershey bar melts and this whole side of the wall starts to collapse as well  yuri chicorychiccholachola  sam any bonus actions any movements do you want to get closer to anybody  yuri ill move towards the beast  sam okay i dont know how im supposed to move lets see here great okay that was hatter we  also did goldilocks moved already right so were to wendy darling  molly cool so the beast is the only enemy in this room  sam that you /none/ can see  noelle gasps whispers whos that  molly im going to walk as close to the beast as i can 30 feet with one move 30 feet and say  hey buddy im sure we can work this all out and im going to cast charm person so he has to make  a wisdom saving throw  sam great lets do it against your spell dc of  molly against 13  sam its 13  molly yeah i dont know why its so bad  sam beast wisdom saving throw he rolled a 13 what does /none/ that mean  noelle and amy he beats it  sam he beats it thank you amy he shakes off the charm it does not work im so sorry  molly oh no thats okay yeah he has advantage anyway because were fighting against him well i  gave it a shot can i make a perception check too  sam sure as your bonus action why not youre looking around roll a perception check  molly thats a 21  sam okay you definitely see lurking in the shadows back there a large large guy hes a  the /none/ camera cant see but theres a big green guy over there lurking in the chocolate  molly okay can i warn my friends or  sam sure go ahead  molly yeah in the corner with the chocolate its big and green  sam theres four corners of chocolate nobody knows where he is  molly wendys not very good at communication  amy the candy look for the candy  noelle thank you for finally admitting that oh my god  sam from out of nowhere this crazy character comes in and you hear a pipe sounds you get /none/ the  sense that this guy usually plays pipes to do things to people and hes going to target the  queen hes going to cast  noelle is he small is he a tiny man  sam he is a halfelf hes going to cast crown of madness against you you have to roll a save its  a wisdom save right i think its wisdom  amy wisdom isnt my best trait so singing come on baby be good to me awesome okay 18 with no  modifier  sam okay you feel the urge to hit one /none/ of your own friends but in that moment you shake the  urge off and youre back focused on the beast it does not work as a bonus action the pied piper  plays a jaunty little ditty which makes the beast ohsohappy and inspired okay that is his turn  let me roll for the troll the troll will be in order next so that is the top of the round who  is first scarecrow and queen of hearts you guys are up  h michael as always i defer  amy awesome so what is my perception /none/ oh who cares im raging so i dont care i dont care  what anyones doing to the beast i am running right up to him and smacking him with my scepter  twice in my frenzy  sam roll for attack twice  amy im also recklessly attacking with this next time he can advantage on me but right now i  also get advantage on him so does an 18 hit  sam an 18 hits yes  amy and does a oh higher than that 21  sam yes that hits  amy perfect then i shall /none/ do that is 12 plus 12 24 damage on that so i run across the coals  and i smack him once right in the ribcage and as i spin around i smack him right in the shoulder  and i yell give me love  laughter  sam the beast is stunned by this crazy madwoman who just dashed through fiery coals to hit him  twice hes super pissed off he snarls at you scarecrow its your turn  h michael i have this opening in the window so i want to open the window  sam sure /none/ you can open the window  h michael and id like to drop down and use my 40 feet of movement to move to the center of the  room  sam okay so it takes ten feet to get down and then well say you get to about there  h michael great and then i have my darts range it says 2060 what does that mean  sam you can throw it 20 feet no problem if you throw at 60 feet you have to roll with  disadvantage to hit so you can hit him but youve /none/ got to roll with disadvantage well say  you can just barely hit that guy  h michael why not ill huck a fucking dart at this motherfucker  sam so roll twice take the lower of the two  h michael with my d20  sam yes  h michael two and a 15 so ill take a four  sam the dart sails up into the air and falls right about here just kind of shy your arms are  not made of muscle they are straw they cant throw very hard  h michael is there anything /none/ else i can do  sam you have bonus any bonusy type of actiony or special move  h michael not much it doesnt say how far i can menace  sam menace would be an action not a bonus action i believe  h michael that makes sense okay i just go sorry guys window was a super bad idea my heart  was in the right place wish id been more helpful  sam hatter youre up oh you could also use an item by the way if you need it i dont know  what else you /none/ have but you could  noelle suspenders  sam laughs you flick your suspenders hatter youre up  h michael then in that case ill take a nibble of one of my pieces of granola from my chest  pouch  sam great  noelle its so nutritious wow  h michael have a nice little snack  yuri im going to cast tashas hideous laughter at the beast  sam you probably just need to get a little bit closer is it 60 or 30 doesnt matter you get  close enough to do it youre fine go ahead /none/ versus a wisdom saving throw whats your  spellcasting ability its 13 i think  yuri 13 yes  sam he rolled a seven he does not  amy yeah the beast it sucks laughs  sam yes he looks at this strange funny little man wearing a funny little hat and he cant help  it hes overcome with the giggles he starts laughing and he cannot stop im looking up  tashas hideous laughter right now to find out what happens so the range is 30 feet so have to  come a little closer for that its /none/ okay you did it youre concentrating on it hes just rolling  with laughter slapping his knees and he falls prone and is unable to stand up  yuri hilarious  amy in my rage i look at you and my eyes are just hearts  yuri heart binoculars  amy

fivefootdiameter sphere by the way  sam hes considered grappled here by the chocolate  molly it shines bright light in a 20foot /none/ radius by the way so if theres anyone else hiding  around here theyre all revealed  sam troll noises you didnt even find out if i was nice or not  stefanie wait can we perception to see oh my god  sam he seems to have blood all over him its probably okay  molly

your eyes  h michael hey how are you doing pretty crazy were in /none/ this big fire right but at least we  have each other  yuri you are so stupid  sam and the pied piper is going to give a little healing to his friend the beast okay thats the  pipers turn troll is going to try to break the grapple he succeeds bursts out of the chocolate  rargh thats his action  stefanie does he end his turn

scarecrow  youre close to geppetto also geppetto is desperately dont you see he just needs love  h michael the blood vision has taken over im so furious at the mad hatter for this verbal insult  right to the quick but a part of me knows ive learned from attacking a friend getting into a  physical altercation with a friend and so absolutely im focused on the queen of hearts at  this moment because she hasnt tried to steal anything out of my body  amy queen /none/ of hearts is getting it  h michael so im going to now theres no way for me to know how long the pied pipers effects  are going to last  sam no you have no idea whats going on you just saw the mad hatter turn to you and smile  stefanie goldilocks takes a second to yell to scarecrow hey i dont believe in love anymore  but i know youre not stupid i know youre smart  h michael thats nice youre still in the doghouse as far as im concerned but thank you  okay /none/ so i think im going to keep more people from being put under this spell im going to use  menacing against the pied piper  sam okay go for it yes roll and hes going to roll against it  h michael lets see so 20  sam he rolled an 18 he is scared of you very scared he sees a weird straw man with granola  dribbling out of his chest  yuri that is basically your purpose in life you just fulfilled your purpose in life  sam do you rip your head apart  h /none/ michael no this time i open my mouth like a snake my jaw pops down and the worst wettest  straw from the inside of me rolls out like awful gray spaghetti onto the ground  amy you are a guillermo del toro character  sam hes watching this happen playing his flute and his jaw drops his flute drops hes so  confused the eyes of the hatter flash back to life he is fine again  yuri youre not stupid i love you youre the smartest person i know  sam all right so he is frightened of /none/ you now intimidated by you  h michael this menacing shit is the tits  sam really is okay so thats scarecrow queen of hearts  amy i see the beast attacking my friend peter and i also know that i might have a little bit of  power but im still angry so i shake him and i say hey you get over here and i very angrily  grapple him and i try to grab him yeah im going to grapple him i dont know if he would even  resist but well see  sam hes not /none/ resisting he lets it happen hes in this weird hug  amy yes its just as awkward as it was with the scarecrow my legs are not where they need to be and  i restrain him as well so hes also restrained  sam he gives into it and hes hugging you back with a very loving caring hug  amy okay and i do the thing that i feel is right and i try to find a spot on his enormous  mouth lip to kiss  sam youre going in for a kiss  amy but an /none/ angry rageful kiss  sam okay thats the best kind  h michael is that the best kind what have your relationships been like  sam lets see here hes shaking theres a lot going on lets say that this is what kind of a  check is this a kiss check how about an animal handling check  yuri that makes sense  amy this is a straight zero modifier for me its an 11  sam okay hes not resisting so really this is just so you can find his mouth so you kind of  climb up /none/ on him a little hes ten feet tall so you climb up on him with your rage strength going  your bulging biceps you use his fur to pull up and you kiss him on the lips hes confused he  withdraws for a second but then you can feel his body relaxing and giving in to it he kisses you  back his black tongue sliding into your mouth hes really going at it with you you can smell  rotten meat and you can kind of see some of captain hooks hair right here at the corner of /none/  his mouth  stefanie i take this moment to shout out and i say hey hey geppetto said he just wants love  just saying  amy copy that im taking him for the team  sam do you kiss him back are you in it  amy i mean how many times do i have to kiss  sam no i mean are you resisting or are you in it  amy i am letting this was the goal so its going betterworse than i thought the main thing  is to turn his attention away from my /none/ friends and onto me who i am very confident that he wont  hurt so yeah i am letting it very much  sam the kiss continues for an uncomfortable amount of time  amy i do what i think i should and kind of grope at his tummy oh well i dont know if i can  reach around his entire  sam his tummys good hes got rippling 12pack abs and hes flexing for you because he really  likes you hes getting more into it youre getting more into it weirdly it looks romantic  lit by /none/ the coal light the red coal light there is dripping chocolate on the walls behind you  theres a piper playing weird dissonant music its the weirdest romantic  yuri basically the most romantic thing weve ever seen  sam yes and in the corner halffrozen geppetto is saying yes yes yes the coals and the fire  flare with a burst of fire that fills the room with light for a second the beast drops to one  knee startled and stunned he says no no yes yes he goes in for another kiss he looks  panicky his /none/ skin is growing paler his shoulders are slumping hes growing weaker as he kisses  you and weaker finally he collapses on the ground the troll confused turns and goes to eat  some chocolate whatever magic was controlling him the spell has been broken the pied piper is  looking around like oh shit please dont hurt me im really weak the beast is writhing in pain  on the floor hes alive but in bad shape  amy is he still a beast or is he human  sam hes still a beast but hes curled up
