/tavern/ dramatic music  applause  matt we found the room  cheering  marisha before that we found the bar  cheering  marisha but it was like running the gauntlet man oh man im here  matt like the original gauntlet not like gauntlet gauntlet– the initial variation of  gauntlet yes marisha ray needs tequila badly  laughter  marisha liquid courage  matt they say it works well well hi everybody

call  you on it  marisha i probably wont call /none/ you on it  matt ill call you on it well be good anyway  marisha im more likely to give a spoiler than probably anyone else in this room  matt i was kind of directing it in this direction  marisha yeah that was probably more for me than anybody else thats a true story  matt raise your hand if you have not seen critical role you are going to be so confused i  am excited for your journey this evening  marisha yeah to that ill say you are all great friends good on you /none/ for being drug here  matt youre seriously earning some great friend

 came about and then well go into questions from you guys i believe we have microphones set up  here in the center of the room so when we begin to open to questions well go ahead and have you  guys very calmly and respectfully /none/ line up behind the microphones we would like to avoid  clotheslining or piledriving unless you are a guile cosplayer which i will allow you one  piledrive thats the only circumstance  marisha thats true in the 30 seconds when people are running you turn into lifeguards for a  second like no the concretes slick  matt check if he has a pulse hes alive were good  audience member its okay im a lifeguard  marisha oh there were good were covered  matt whats your name  audience member taylor  matt taylor all right so /none/ if anyone gets crushed its taylors

matt if anyone watched last nights episode you really know the importance of clerics  cheering /none/  matt oh man actually thats a good call we should apologize in advance for our loopy  mentality right now we did do our show last night left on a seven am flight this morning with  a layover  marisha we tend to not leave the studio until about 1130 midnightish anyway  matt yeah because i have to unpack everything  marisha then we had to pack up when we got home then you have the adrenaline so youre like i  cant believe raishan shes such a bitch and then its hard to go to sleep /none/  matt

in the best way laughter im sorry  marisha oh yeah you east coasters  cheering and groaning  marisha i know  matt look if we did it any earlier sam would just be that much more late  marisha its honestly true we made that time specifically because its the earliest we can do  /none/ to accommodate sam  matt basically yeah mr ducktales for those who dont know they announced recently the  ducktales cast its amazing sam our bard is the voice director for that series im forever  jealous of him for that  marisha hey man hes just slowly turning into mr disney  matt i know but they wont take him from us they can try  marisha not like nbc did crying  awwing  matt im so torn because we want you to support her show blindspot but if it doesnt come back  we get her back /none/ but no watch the show its a great show we want to support her  marisha its really great show but  matt selfishly they need heals  marisha look its nothing she hasnt said herself shes like well my dd group though  matt it makes me so happy  marisha i know thats how you know youre winning  matt or ive instilled a poor priority list in all of my friends one of the two  marisha biggest job of my career dd group  matt what could possibly go wrong smash cut to me under an /none/ overpass bridge in ten years slowly  rocking inside of a cardboard  marisha youll have all of our critical role tshirts to keep you warm  matt exactly in the nature of opening the discussion with you guys if you do have a  question thats burning in the back of your mind calmly and carefully hopefully without a need of  the lifeguards start making your way towards these microphones in the front well make two  lines here and well alternate between either one  marisha i love because you were so adamant about your warning that /dung/ everyone was like  laughter  matt that type of control only comes from being a dungeon master yeah this is true actually  fantastic all right we will do our best to accommodate as many questions as we can in the  time we have allotted for this panel which means well try and be as concise as possible with our  answers so we can get to as many as possible im sure there will be many topics well ramble on for  for an extended period of time well do our best to get to as many /none/ as we can if we dont get to  your question here bring it up in another panel even if its completely not critical rolerelated  its fine  marisha its fine  matt itll confuse the rest of our panel you choose  marisha okay yes you left first  audience member i dont know if you can hear me  marisha i can hear you youre good if you want to tilt the mic down a little bit there you go yeah  audience member i love the show i know you guys are a bunch of theater /none/ nerds which is awesome  yay theater nerds i love it when everybody gets to sing in the show sam does it the most but you  guys all jump in and its great  matt if i ever told myself oh yeah youll be singing musical theater on the internet in front  of thousands of people id be like because i hate myself because i want to be hunted down so  thank you that we have an opportunity for this  audience member if you could cast any musical with either the cast or the characters what /none/ would  it be  marisha if i could cast a musical  audience member yeah if you could put on a musical  marisha if i could put on a musical ooh its like the power you go first  matt we all have our very deepseated obsessive love of hamilton but  marisha its hard to do hamilton better  matt yeah thats the thing id say knowing our types of humor and our love of trey parker and  matt stone id probably say book of mormon  marisha yeah god thats such a great show  /none/ matt and marisha singing and a mormon just believes  marisha if i was to reinvent a musical okay so you could go one of two ways right you could be  like i just want to direct this and make the best version it could possibly be in its pure state  or you could turn something on its head like a terrible musical like cats now youre giving me  ideas maybe i could do a 2017 version of cats and its like lol cats and its all internet  memes you know  laughter  marisha come /none/ on thats a good idea singing ninja cats do and ninja cats dont ninja cats  do ninja cats dont i dont know  matt i feel like the cat that had the petal put on its head and it saw through infinity  marisha that could go into thats magical mr mistoffelees right there  matt okay points ill give you that  marisha cats such a bullshit answer by the way  matt and marisha kickass  audience member hi  matt hi  audience member i just wanted to say thank you so much for being you /none/ guys and just being wonderful  and getting me back into dd getting me into 5th edition because im coming from 35 so thank you  for that  matt awesome  audience member but my question is sort of a merchandise question because do you spice just  hear me out on this one its real brief the shirt idea is just spice with a question mark  matt weve had discussions  audience member please because spice  matt spice  marisha yeah weve got plans  matt well just put out small packets of cinnamon critical role /none/ brand spice or just  different spices in each package you dont know what youre getting  marisha oh my god can we come out with critical role branded spices like just legit spices i  dont know  matt oh or we could have a packet of suude we dont tell you how to use it  marisha i feel like thats a lawsuit ready to happen right there  matt totally worth it  marisha yeah tweet all of your complaints at geek  sundry not at us okay yes  sarah im sarah thatgamergrl on twitter  /none/ matt and marisha hi  sarah i have a questions mostly for marisha but matt since youre currently running the game you  can do it too  matt okay  sarah female gamers know that its difficult being us its particularly difficult when youre  the significant other of the male gamer and even more so when your significant other is the dm  somehow other players dont think that youre there for the game they think youre there for  your boy or trying to pretend you want to be there you know  marisha sure yeah all /none/ the things  sarah also they think we have advanced knowledge and get special treatment all that sort of thing  marisha yep and did you make him sleep on the couch how many times have i heard that one  laughter  marisha anyway keep going  sarah obviously youve dealt with this before how have you dealt with it matt how have you  helped deal with it at the table  marisha thats a good question theres been a few times i think there was a little bit there  for a while that even our fellow /none/ game players were like marisha you know something and i  was like i would love it if he talked to me you guys but he just doesnt  matt shell come into my office at times when im working on game stuff and shell be like  hey matt and ill be like dont look dont look at me  marisha its a little like mom youre supposed to knock  matt pushing maps in the corner shushing what  marisha yeah he does a lot he does that its all true thats whats funny about it yeah but /none/  ive gotten that people have been like oh is matt going easier on her and theres also  certain people who have said the opposite of like they think hes being harder on me in order  to really prove that hes not being easier on me you know so its a catch22 but luckily i think  theres especially a lot of us whore starting to come out of the woodwork these days and were  like no were on the level were cool we have a pretty good separate dmandplayer relationship  and we try to respect /none/ it  matt and respect is the key because when you consider that a person is at the table to play the  game they want to play it for the challenges and the same level as everyone else does and yeah  you might say oh they get special treatment its like youre disrespecting her and her  interest in being a gamer and wanting to come at this at the same level of challenge that everybody  else is so its just being able to distinguish that difference and respect as players at the  table that thats /tavern/ not the case  marisha yeah cheatings not fun thats what people have always said do you go into his  notes do you sneak into his notes into his binders im like no thats dumb  matt i have that shit alarmed  laughter  matt id know  sarah thank you very much  matt no worries good question  cheering  matt hello sir you look so dapper  audience member yeah i came from the bar to be here you met my wife  applause laughter  audience member how are we doing drinks good  /none/ matt hi whats your question  marisha you have our attention  laughter  marisha your wifes still alive right nah keep going  audience member she took a lovely picture with you and sent it to me while i was sitting here  matt and marisha oh  marisha so much more makes sense  laughter  audience member no matt met my wife  matt i was like did i black out for half an hour because im an asshole anyway you had a question  audience member well first off i just wanted to thank you guys /none/ very much or blame you guys i  dont know im currently in five games codming two dming one i blame you mostly  matt i am sorry and youre welcome  laughter  marisha you just read that off like majorleague baseball stats  audience member i had to compute it because people are like hey do you have room for a  game blahblahblah and i was like no but i just wanted to its a thank you mostly its  been great and being back into rp is just awesome  matt welcome back and let me /none/ tell you how long have you been playing approximately  audience member see thats the thing when i was a kid boy scouts i stole one of the 2nd ed i  think it was gods and something books from one of my friends  matt deities and demigods  marisha good for you it was better off in your hands  audience member but i never got to be in games when i was that age there was just nobody around  matt but thats the thing though were going into an age now where not only is the /none/ game more  accessible to a larger audience but theres less of that stigma to discuss it and people are more  interested in either getting back into it or finally learning what it actually is and its  actually a lot of fun when i grew up like you said youre in five games now that would be  insane to me when i was 14  audience member well its insane now dont worry  matt yeah it was like spotting a ufo youre like wait wait you know somebody else who  plays dd you dont want /none/ to join our group no thats fine  audience member ive already gotten the question three times this but no i had a  questionquestion this is with dming when you have a group and they write nice backstories and  then you go and say okay i can create this around all of this and then its like okay now  whose do i do and will that piss off everybody else whose backstory doesnt time yet say if  someone is on a vision quest or something for a long time  marisha those damn vision quests  /none/ matt whose backstory do you choose like what order to go in  audience member yeah like do you have some way that you try to prioritize that  matt i think it depends on their backstories and considering what level of difficulty that might  come to fruition in if someones backstory deals with a drug lord that crossed their family and  theyre trying to get vengeance on them that could be a fairly lowlevel encounter that could  have some longrunning background elements you could tie into the future if someones like  well my backstory is /none/ i had one of the evil gods devour my people on a continent that sank into the  ocean youre like probably not getting to that until the later levels so that does help at least  prioritize somewhat at least as far as the scale of the groups power if there isnt that  easytodiscovery priority list per se then see if theres any that you can combine see if  theres a plot from one backstory and another that they thought were completely unrelated that  suddenly tie into being the same group or the same villain or /none/ perhaps its fate that came together  for this specific purpose or just tell a player hold off a while be respectful i cant do  everybodys story at once this is going to turn into the wire  laughter  matt so yeah that would be my biggest recommendation its a hard balance it really is  i havent had the opportunity to get too deep into ive touched a bit on scanlans story and  pike she just hasnt been around but the first player to really get a heavy backstory element  after two and a half /none/ years of gaming was percy up to that point i hadnt really tied anyones  backstory into it so heavily so dont feel like its something you have to frontload either  marisha i think the twins kind of went first because their dad happened to be like the  president of syngorn  matt ambassador  marisha which is kind of like one of our neighboring towns so we wound up dealing with  some of their stuff at the home game and i remember the first time when they were like  hello father and we were all /dung/ like what because they didnt tell us that  matt it was like a maury episode yeah  marisha because that was the first time wed really gotten to anyones backstory stuff so we  were like plot twist anyway continue  audience member well that was the main part of the question thank you thank you guys so much  for what you do its great and i look forward to it every week  matt and marisha thank you  matt and good on you for taking up the mantle of helping dungeon master other games i cant /dung/  emphasize it enough for so many years ive known people who were afraid to pick up the mantle of  the dungeon master it is daunting it seems but its a thrill in its own right to create a story  to create a space for your friends to play in and thats your gift to them and let them live and  breathe and write stories within that space that you created is theres no feeling quite like it  audience member yeah and on the other note theres always the thing of i have all this  /none/ stuff created and i cant tell you this yet were not there yet  matt i know but once you wait for the right moment to release it and you go here and they  all go what youre like yeah i dont know which mic to drop theres like six at the table  laughter  matt but yeah you know what i mean good question  applause  marisha yeah i remember when you went to go get drinks with eric whos my writer for signal  boost and you were like hey man id really love to /none/ go get drinks and he was like oh  okay yeah sure man ive never really hung out oneonone im not sure what he wants to talk to  me about and then his side is that you sat him down and you were like dude okay heres what  im planning for their campaign and i have to tell someone  laughter  marisha and you dumped the entire campaign on him  matt yeah i think him matt colville and chris perkins are the only people that know what the  next arc in your campaign is  /none/ marisha once again cant talk to anybody  matt im tempted like time to steal some money or im just going to melt down  marisha yeah eric came back with gray hair hed seen the future  matt snowblind aged 40 years he had no legs it was weird  laughter  matt next question  sho hi my name is sho i started playing dungeons and dragons two years ago a little over  two years ago in the summer i started off as a dm of my friends i started off with eight people actually  marisha /none/ you started as a dm  sho i started as a dm yeah  matt talk about training with weights on dude damn  sho it lasted two days  laughter  matt very fast workout  sho but currently right now im playing with a very good group of people were playing through a  tyranny of dragons right now and im working on a campaign on the side that im also keeping locked  down and secret you know but my real question is general for the both of you guys whether dming or  just as a /none/ player what is your favorite monster out of all whether to fight or to just use  matt you first  marisha i love displacer beasts just because theyre displacer kitties theyre so cute oh  youre so scary arent you you think youre scary thats how you beat displacer beasts  youre just like youre scary  matt oh youre going to hate them when youre back to your new campaign at level three  marisha yeah totally no they were really hard at level three also i mean beholders beholders  are iconically amazing and hard to fight /none/ and each one is a little tactically different i love that  matt yeah theyre hyperparanoid theyre just strange and dangerous those are fun all of those  are good choices  marisha what about you  matt look  laughter  matt i have yet to be able to use it in a campaign and when i opened the 2nd edition  monster manual in my freshman year of high school and i saw the godzillalike artwork i fell in  love immediately with the tarrasque  cheering  matt i like the idea of an entity that is /none/ such a powerful force of nature on such a mythological  level that it just slumbers beneath the surface of the world and emerges once every generation or so  to rise up and eat for weeks anything in its path until eventually its either defeated or  its quelled its hunger and then slumbers back into the core of the earth again supposedly on an  infinite loop for all of time thats fun also hypermagic resistant vorpal bite trample  attacks its fun  marisha so fun super fun  matt hope they never run into one  /tavern/ audience member final boss  matt good question  sho yeah thanks so much  matt thanks buddy you sir  heath hi my name is heath  matt hey zeke  heath heath heath like the candy bar  matt oh heath i misunderstood that  heath everyone does  matt as a fan of heath bars im sorry  heath anthony burch last year he got it the first try  matt did he really anthony  marisha damn it anthony smart guy  heath my question goes to both of you what moment in dd gave you /none/ the greatest impact outside  the game  laughter  marisha no pressure or anything  laughter  marisha its like should we know this ahead of time  laughter  marisha i feel like we should  heath if it makes you feel better this was a secondary question my initial question would have  gone to the excremancer scanlan  matt excremancer  laughter  heath but hes not here  marisha im sorry i couldnt even attempt to answer a question like sam can so im not even  going to try  matt i would say /dung/ two moments for me ones going to be legitimate ones going to be a little  cheesy the legitimate one is the moment that i decided to become a dungeon master as a  performer because it was a lot of pressure but it also allowed me a space where i could create  and understand so many different varying character personalities from my imagination and give them  life give them a voice give them a personality and play in that space it helped me hone a lot of  the skills that i still use today as a /dung/ professional performer so deciding to be a  dungeon master in a space where the only experience i had was one dude who was a really bad  dungeon master and i became one out of spite as a reaction to his campaign really nice guy but  just not that great of a storyteller that was important to me honestly it sounds cheesy but  the moment that we decided to do the livestream it went against a lot of our instincts for such a  personal game and we were like i dont know man we all had /none/ our brushes with the internet  and the internet being a mob of flaming torches and pitchforks we were like okay do we want to  set us up for this kind of heartbreak i think our decision to take it to the stream and hope for  the best led to two years of this  applause  marisha i have one of my new revelations with keyleth is ive said this a couple times but i  genuinely feel like ever since ive embodied keyleth and especially more so since the stream  started because we play more /none/ on a weekly basis i genuinely feel like shes made me a more  empathetic and compassionate person because me personally im more closed off and a little bit  more im more introverted i have my social anxieties keyleth helped me get that first  instinct because her first instinct is always im going to do whatever i can for the betterment  of other people thats not necessarily my first instinct she taught me a lot genuinely about  that then i remember even the moment that i had with patrick rothfuss on stream which i dont  /none/ want to like once again no spoilers  applause  marisha yeah patrick my new best friend thats our joke hes my friend now because its patrick  rothfuss that moment that was amazing because patrick and i didnt really know each other aside  from acquaintances before he came on the stream that was really the first time we had really met  before that episode started he was by the coffee machine in the lobby in the kitchen in our area  in our green room he was like marisha i dont know if i can do this /none/ i was like what do you  mean man its fine hes like no you guys are so funny and youre witty you guys are so  quick and i dont know i was like dude youre patrick rothfuss what no man its  going to be great youre going to get in there and maybe youll be fine after a few minutes  then he told me afterwards this turned into a tangent im sorry we brought him in in the  middle of the episode and earlier that episode keyleth was having problems with her morality and  /none/ the heroworship and trying to figure out if what she was doing was actually helping instead of  just that surface helping like windex patrick told me after that he was like when i saw  keyleth going through that i was like okay thats where kerr is going to have his entry  point and thats where they can relate of course its all improv i had no idea any of that  was going to happen that was such a transformative moment for i think both me and  keyleth he really got keyleth out of a rut /none/ after that that was just ill never forget that  moment never  applause  matt thank you for the question hello  marisha sorry i talked for a long time on that one  matt thats okay  marisha keep going  audience member hi im going to be really nervous first congratulations on your engagement  cheering  audience member wish you guys a life of love and happiness together ive been married ten years  and its awesome may you always roll crit 20s  awwing  audience member youre adorable and just inspiring my question is /none/ for keyleth its very  noticeable that youve grown and changed i wanted you to talk a little bit about how your  interactions with the other characters theres a moment that comes to mind with you and vex that  was like sisters  marisha yeah  audience member especially now that youre dating somebody in the party how has her relationship  with other members of the group changed especially now that shes in that really emotional relationship  marisha thats a great question keyleth has always felt like the odd man out you know once  again /none/ shell always go with the flow unless she feels like its real bad guys like maybe we  should really think about this ive had a few people in the interwebs be like why does keyleth  always have to disagree with everybody she doesnt actually its just that she doesnt  really speak up a lot of the times youre literally only remembering the times that she  does its taken her a while to get that courage to be that kind of a person she also thinks  its not that she thinks she knows i know shes /none/ the least coolest member of the group  awwing  marisha come on you guys thats true for vex keyleth looks at vex and shes like oh my god  shes the it girl shes so cool man shes the popular girl i know the moment youre talking  about and i remember that any time i think keyleth gets a little bit of that popular girl  attention the internet has also picked up on that a little bit too its just the twins man  they get people going you know she like vax says in a weird /none/ way theyre the perfect  dichotomy of each other because vex still has that shes just such a badass shes the han  solo of our group man shes just fucking cool as times gone on i think shes gotten more  comfortable but maybe one day keyleth will be cool maybe one day  audience member shes always cool  marisha hey thats her purpose thats her role its good  audience member shes amazing and thank you guys so much  marisha yeah thank you  matt hello  audience member hi speaking of couples that game together /dung/ my husband and i have been gaming  together for about 13 years and we have five games going between the two of us  matt nice congrats  audience member yeah heaven help us basically a couple years ago at magfest they had a panel  called beyond dd we learned about a few games there theres a lot of games out there that are  similar to dungeons  dragons in the mechanics but we then learned about a bunch of games that  are completely different things like dungeon world where its moves and 2d6 and dread /none/ where  its a jenga tower instead of dice i was wondering if you guys have played games like that  either those two or other ones and what you think about those style of games  matt i played a number of systems growing up dd was my first introduction into rpg and will always  be my dearest because it for a lot of people was the introduction and the kickstart moment of the  genre as a whole i grew up playing the palladium universe for better or for worse through rifts  which is broken in /dung/ its own right i love call of cthulhu tremendously dungeon worlds a great  system actually ive only had the opportunity in recent years to try that one out exalted was fun  because you play an anime character being ridiculous you get more benefits for having the  most ridiculous combos like thats even cooler then you get more cool because youre so cool  because anime exalted is fun in that regard a lot of the white wolf stuff world of darkness is  a lot of fun  audience member we played white wolf for a very /none/ long time exalted was always great we had that  oneshot boss where we killed him in one shot and the gm was looking at a sheet and we were like  did we kill him he drew three more more health boxes and was like no  matt thats awesome ive played a lot of terrible systems i played a oneshot in a world  called synnibarr which is one of the worst games ever made and i played it because of that it  already had that reputation and i was like i at least have to try /dung/ this once and it lived up to  its reputation it made rifts look super streamlined beautiful and cohesive as far as  worldbuilding it was incredible marisha  marisha yeah of course we had our pathfinder game before we switched over he was also my first  dungeon master it was before we were dating you actually dmed for me and my boyfriend at the time  thats true  matt yeah that wasnt the intent that was a year and half before we started dating  marisha thats also true  matt it wasnt im a good boy /none/  laughter  matt it was very respectful i was crushing on her hardcore but very respectful  awwing  matt pathetic horn blowing  marisha was that a matt mercer horn thats amazing  matt shut up continue answering your question  marisha anyway we played pathfinder i played a buffy the vampire system for a while which was  fun together if you step outside of rpgs for a bit in terms of couple gaming we play mansions  of madness all the time mansions of madness is great and they just came out with a new system /none/  thats amazing a second edition we also play a lot of minecraft together because its our come  home from a 14 hour day and need to zone out and hit blocks for an hour its our zen thing and  you get the nice minecraft zen meditation music youre like this is almost like a spa  matt couples that stay in their pajamas playing minecraft together i think is a very therapeutic  experience for the two of you i highly recommend it if its a rainy day outside get yourself a  cup of coffee sit /none/ there and be like hey babe you want to build a castle out of this mountain  lets do it  marisha oh my god thats the best yes i do  matt lets raise some sheep  marisha oh man you get the cows ill get the sheep  audience member we play hots so that i can take over towers as ragnaros  marisha yeah we play wow together too totally good times  cheering  matt hello oh its becca beccas our og critter  marisha hi the light was obscuring you a little bit i can /none/ see you now cant really see you now  i can see you now  matt just so you guys know becca i think was legitimately the first critter we met at a  convention after the show had originally launched beccas been there from the beginning  marisha its true yeah  cheering  becca that was two years ago in march that was a long time ago my question is actually about your  playlists that you guys started doing because i love them and ive probably listened to vexs  first one and keyleths first one more /none/ than enough times my question is obviously you guys make  them with your characters in mind but i wanted to know how much of your own personal favorite genres  and stuff like that also influence what went into the playlists  marisha thats a good question to preface a little bit about what shes talking about in case  you didnt know all of us put out character spotify playlists to help give you a little more  insight into some of our characters we did it last year and were right in the middle of our  /none/ second round because quite frankly we enjoy doing them so much and we wanted to do it again  were all music lovers whos not a music lover this is magfest everyone heres got to be a music  lover we wanted to do it again you can all find them on geek  sundry spotify i actually went  searching a decent amount for a lot of my stuff it definitely has a lot of my musical influences  my dad raised me on a lot of bluegrass and classic rock and folk and things like that i  /none/ grew up in kentucky this part of the woods you guys theyre all songs that i love and definitely  speak to my influence of music but still very much have that keyleth taste we get really anal  retentive about them well be like no its not perfect enough its close but not enough weve  spent months on those finding the perfect songs  matt i just picked songs that i knew and liked  marisha thats not true  matt no there was a little bit of searching  marisha you had an even harder time because /dung/ you were doing the npc playlists you had one or two  songs per character which is hard  matt yeah it was like how do i encompass an entire npcs personality in one song i chose  elements of each and it was hard to do a lot of mine were songs that i already knew or i was a fan  of the bands and picked one that fit for those characters and then a lot of searching as well  ill be doing a second list soon should be interesting  becca bangarang was my favorite one /none/ off of yours  marisha wait which one oh bangarang oh yeah thats a good one  becca thanks  matt thank you becca i think we can get all these questions done in the next seven minutes  theres a panel after this right  marisha are you gilmore  audience member i am  matt damn right you are thats amazing gilmore voice if i do say so myself you look glorious  audience member absolutely actually marisha you answered my original question just curious  about whether keyleths playstyle was something that came naturally to you or /none/ if you really had to  think about what keyleth did i think that watching her growth through this series has been  such a delight ive been binge watching so its been a little rapidfire for me i wanted to thank  you for that matt weve seen all these wonderful npcs come through that maybe you had a plan for  maybe were small and got away from you and ended up a little longer than you thought they would in  the series i was wondering if you would share with us a quirk a tidbit of /dung/ backstory  personality trait that you would have liked to work in for an npc that never made it into the game  matt oh thats an interesting point who knows some elements might still come in per se who to  pick its interesting you try to prepare as much as you can as dungeon master but the players  always inevitably go nowhere you expect you end up having to throw half your stuff out the window  thats part of the fun of being dungeon master you go okay lets see where this goes ive  been /none/ really excited that through the marquet journey theyve got to see a bit more of gilmores  backstory which is fun seen some more about alluras history and initial adventuring party a  bit the original battle with thordak and stuff like that i would say there hasnt been enough  time or interaction in vasselheim the platinum sanctuary and highbearer vord and the history of  how kima came under his training and their relationship which is of mutual respect but also  tenuous teacher and impetuous student even for as many years as theyve been working together and /dung/  as high ranked as kima is within the order we never had the opportunity to really explore that  too much and i dont know if we will depending on where the game goes maybe it will well see  kimas always been a personal favorite of mine its a character archetype i never got a chance to  roleplay too often which was the all right you guys are planning youre taking too long im  kicking the door anyway i love that i love the individual that while wise and understands and  never acts in a /none/ way that would endanger people and is plotting well but still gets impatient and  will push even their plot forward in a way that will freak everyone else around them but they  wont tell anyone that i got it under control in the end when everything works okay and theyre  like what are you doing theyre like oh it was fine i had a plan the whole time like why  didnt you say anything forgot kima works in that realm a lot well see maybe one day  awesome all righty we have a few more /none/ minutes we do have a panel i believe after this right  i think so yeah so we wont be able to stay after ill try to get through a couple more  questions as fast as possible and if we dont get to your question like i said come to our other  panel keep it in mind and if you dont get to it at magfest maybe hit it on twitter or another convention  marisha or talks machina  ben hi im ben  matt and marisha hi ben  ben ill make this quick thank you /none/ for your amazing game but also thank you for creating the  community of people that has surrounded here i met so many amazing people through twitter so  many of my now closest friends because of you guys and i can only thank you so much for that a  little bit of backstory to my question my critter game online is hitting one year next week and i  play an aarakocra sorcerer my question to matt is how have you if youve even thought of it  implemented aarakocra into your world at all do they have /none/ any roles specifically within either the  prime material plane or the air elemental plane or anything like that or have you not even  thought of it whatsoever  matt the campaign guide as it comes to fruition later this year will have information about that  theyre not wellknown within most civilized areas in taldorei the continent proper they do exist  on the outskirts of society and usually dont interact on this continent too often with the  fairer races i guess youd say theyre a little more common on other continents specifically  wildemount thats as /none/ much as i can tell you  audience member thank you  matt good question  audience member hi quick question you mentioned how the internet can be a mob of angry people with  pitchforks my question would be how do you find the conviction to stay true to what you think your  character would do and what your characters arc would be despite everybody being like they  shouldnt do this or they shouldnt be in that situation  marisha much to their chagrin im sure i just dont listen to them  cheering  marisha dont /none/ get me wrong i hear them i feel it but their thoughts on how they think keyleth  should act or respond i appreciate that in their realm and what they think that thats what fits  into their headcanon and thats fine but ive been with this character for almost five years  now like we were talking about earlier every decision that were encroached with im like  well i would do no how would keyleth act this is what she would do there is thought  behind all of our actions some of them are impulsive but /none/ even in that moment weve been  with these characters for so long we know them pretty well  matt to add onto that too characters realistic characters are complicated and full of  contradictions and flaws  marisha not perfect  matt while a lot of media you can pinpoint a few similar traits that can explain a certain  character and that may be true most of the time but there will be exceptions therell be points  of high duress therell be points of extreme emotional pain there will be moments of severe  fury or wish /town/ for vengeance that a character will act out of their normal active zone those moments  are wonderful and human and places you can really identify with as many of us have been in those  same places on one might be like no why is that character doing this that doesnt make  sense how many times have you done some things that didnt make sense and you may have regretted  down the road thats part of the process too we also understand that passion is passion after  every episode we get that barrage of oh my /none/ god why our first response is like because then  we all calm down the next day and were like eh its all right  audience member thank you  matt no worries  marisha maybe time for one or two more  matt one or two quick ones because we dont want to hold up the rest of the evening two more quick  questions those we didnt get to were so sorry we have another panel please bring it with you  next time  marisha yes  matt question  james hello james klaus wizard on the /none/ coast i had actually a very pragmatic question for you  matt how do you price out lauras bear armor  matt oh how do you price out lauras bear armor id have to go back to my notes a lot of  it is spur of the moment trying to figure it out based on well the time of an actual suit of  armor and then barding for a creature and then custom barding for what is a noncommon creature  to have armor constructed for it would be like double or triple the cost and then you /none/ consider  the materials involved are rare materials and the quality of how they were harvested so for that  james whos going to do it  matt yeah to find somebody whos actually comfortable doing this and rolling for them to see  if they dont end up ruining the materials and then like well heres half your money back and  you dont get anything it can be that complicated if you want to or you can just say uh its  5000 heres your armor depends on how you want to run your game i run in /none/ the middle of not too  overcomplicated and a little bit of just keeping the narrative flowing but a lot of those moments  like that i didnt know she was going to try and do custom bulette armor for trinket so i went  sure itll cost this much and you have to find this person make notes later to write down how  much the bulette armor was you know so off the top of my head i have no idea but im sure  critrolestats would be happy to let you know  laughter  james the /none/ other thing is after last nights episode i thought that maybe you guys could use  some chocolate so i bought some chocolate  matt oh what thats awesome thank you buddy  marisha thank you  matt and you for the final question of the evening monsieur  audience member welcome good to have you back matt marisha welcome to the venue first off  thank you guys for both the entertainment and the inspiration matt your dming mastery has inspired  me to start working on my own homebrew campaign in the witcher universe  matt oh yes /none/  marisha can i just say real quick it sounds like were all going down on the titanic for this  last question so i just want to relish this moment proceed green arrow proceed  audience member indeed so this is more of a prestream question having gone through the first  campaign with people like crossfit which blows peoples minds has there ever been an instance  when the crit role campaign really started that felt like it was going to come off the rails and  just not work  marisha like when we started streaming oh /none/ before stream  matt its hard to do that when well ive been gaming for a long time and it comes with  experience to learn how to bullshit your way to get things back on the rails it may be by the  seat of your pants but as long as your players are having a good time its better to let them  guide that to that point so even if its completely away from your story and youre like  all right i wrote three hours of story that were never going to see thats fine if /none/ the  players are having a good time you just let them roll and see where the story finds itself at that  point if you can find a way to connect it back try to if not finish the session thanks guys  that was great and then spend the next week going oh shit how do i bring this back  downtime as dm between sessions is huge to try and tie those threads back together but you dont  want to feel like youre pushing the players back because they went too far beyond the boundary  /none/ because i think that goes against the the nature of what makes dd so special is the fact that you  can essentially push in any direction and not find an invisible barrier and run off the corner like a  bad resident evil character so yeah i dont think there was ever a point where i felt like it  wasnt going to work there were definitely many points where i was like i have no idea whats  going to happen and the session ends and im like all right i got homework good game guys  good /none/ game  audience member another chocolaterelated question my moms also from kentucky and i took  up the tradition of making bourbon balls  marisha uhh  matt we do have a signing tomorrow i dont think shell say no to that you are doing the lords work  matt that is fantastic  marisha chocolateanticipatory gibberish  matt guys thank you all so much for coming to our critical role panel  cheering  matt were not worthy never enough time for all the questions but like i said please bring them  to other panels well be happy
