responsible for a lot of strife  liam /none/ dicks  matt  in the background of percivals history seemingly responsible for the destruction of his  entire family and have for the past five years been essentially ruling his home city and castle  they were out for a political banquet with sovereign uriel in emon and the party members of  vox machina they were all invited to be part of this didnt quite go as planned there was a  scuffle and the briarwoods absconded back to whitestone they sent a couple assassins out to  attempt to take out their driver who was spilling information /none/ and essentially was going to be vox  machinas way of being free of any sort of political issues based on their actions that  evening and after much discussion and preparation and purchasing a lot of mirrors the party took  their transit over to the eastnortheast towards whitestone where they began to traverse the  alabaster sierras to the north using the mountain range as opposed to going directly through the  forest there they managed to avoid encountering a bunch of harpies that were distracted by eating  the horses they left behind  travis damn  /none/ matt they camped for the evening and began to make their way through some sort of a mountainous  valley that led in towards the forest surrounding whitestone while they were traveling down this  pass there was a rumbling and some sort of really fast rapidmoving large blue creature that  leaped down in front catching them offguard and that is where we begin today  travis probably should have fucking researched that creature  taliesin did the creature look like that  matt that blue creature  laura yeah right that would have been smart  taliesin okay /none/ just checking  travis i never do that  laura i know so

you forward a few feet as you clench down on it eventually it yanks its way  out taking a couple of scales with it you can see a streak where teeth marks are  on the back of its tail  /none/ marisha growls  matt awesome does that end your turn  marisha yeah  travis nice minxie  marisha growls  matt tiberius is going to go around the corner again and is going to cast telekinesis and send  his glaive up spinning  laura glaive  sam he has a glaive  laura the thing that he killed the old lady with  sam oh  liam its the granny grinder  marisha and matt granny grinder  travis so bad  matt rolls a two unfortunately though just streaks off and spins back around and then while /none/  it misses the creature and stops hovering above his head with a slow spin sits there curling his  fingers grinning at the creature and is going to the use of the rest of this movement to go back  behind the rock because mama didnt raise no fool vax youre up  liam its preoccupied so i just leisurely walk backwards about 30 feet looking at the same wound  that i started before  matt this way  liam no back up the chasm here even further away yeah and im just going to throw three  /none/ daggers into the wound i already hit so im going to do that again i know that hits because it hit  the last time thats a 23  matt that hits  liam and thats sneak attack because hes occupied thats 11 plus  laura ooh

matt you begrudgingly take 1d10 inspiration dice from scanlan  travis is the creature blinded from the pokeypoke  matt it is not it is a resilient creature and the impact was mainly absorbed by the ocular  sockets as opposed to the eyes themselves  travis hey i didnt ask for /none/ science jesus  all laugh  matt theres bone around never mind all right it ends scanlans turn percy youre up  travis laughs just a little pokey  taliesin all right im going to try and fix this broken piece of gosa  sam do i lose another spell for that or is that just the same  matt no you can maintain concentration

as you go and you fix it it takes the first shot with a burst of flame  that shoots out the front of the barrel the second shot this time the actual metal in the  front arcs upward and it looks like

hair and stands back /none/ up  taliesin ill take that ill take that  all laugh  laura oh no  matt thatll end its turn vex youre up  marisha that felt like shockwave  laura oh god can i as a bonus action give trinket a healing potion  matt you can that would be more of an action to feed it to something else  laura okay never mind i am going to attack it  matt okay  laura okay hes oh i missed thats a 14  matt a 14 does not hit unfortunately the first arrow just ricochets /none/ and shatters across the part  of its body  laura great good times good times 16 both miss fucking a what a waste

little rough  matt its hard to tell with this entity /none/  taliesin damn it  matt its moving so fast  travis id like to reach up with my firebrand warhammer  sam yes  travis and i would like to smash it on top of its skull and when it hits the ground id just like to  keep turning it into jelly and paste and sweet jams that i can bottle it up and sell later  matt you guys watch this continuous barrage this horrible bludgeoning every impact almost quakes  the inside of this valley rocks are beginning to tumble and fall around it and you /dung/ can see as  each horrible sickening smack its head just collapses more and more the mush begins to spill  out from under it this giant pool of like dark violet liquid and gelatinous mush that was once  the inside of its head begin to just grow around it as grog just keeps hitting and hitting and  hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting  marisha grog grog  matt and hitting and hitting  laura grog  sam i use bigbys hand to stop the hammer  laura maybe you unrage lullaby hulk lullaby  sam /none/ its over its over  marisha and travis lullaby  sam think of the beard  travis what happened  taliesin well  laura you killed it real good  travis oh look we made jelly  marisha speaking of jelly i would like to go ahead and do a nature check to see if i can  salvage some goods from whatever  laura i run i walk up to it and kick it and say thats for trinket dick  matt okay  travis can i roll a hit dice to recover some  matt if you guys /dung/ want to take a short rest you can  travis oh  laura thatd be great  taliesin yes i would like to fix my gun just a giant pile of tools  laura do we need to hide do we need to climb up to its little cave that it was in maybe  and hide  sam did it have a cave  travis was it in a cave  laura it had a cave didnt it come out of a cave when we saw it  matt you saw it was up on a higher platform you /dung/ didnt see a cavern or anything  laura oh i thought it was a cave  marisha i rolled a 21 to collect goods  matt okay looking through the book that you have you eventually take a while to look while  you guys are having your short rest you can use your hit dice to heal yourself  it is known as a behir  sam a behir  matt behir  marisha behir  taliesin behir  travis be here  laura be here right now be present  matt behir there are two things anything in /none/ the face and teeth are gone they are just mush the  entire head is destroyed  marisha sure  matt the the two things in the book that are worthwhile like really worth money are some of  its hide can be repurposed for you know like lightning resistbased armor but currently its  unknown who has the speciality to actually work with that material these creatures are difficult to  harvest and a lot of their locations are unknown a lot of them were hunted down for that long ago  and almost thought to have gone extinct /dung/  all groan  matt however yes you dont know anybody possibly karin in emon the hide can be harvested  there is also a gland in its throat that it uses to charge its lightning breath  taliesin id like that  marisha id like that  matt go ahead and roll for the hide first if you guys want to go for that  laura can i stealth and climb up and see if i can see a cavern  matt sure  laura a little cave  marisha natural 20  travis oh snap  laura yeah /none/  travis ill take it  sam she gets advantage because mountains are her favorite terrain  laura what do i add to that  matt this would be add your  laura acrobatics  matt for climb this would be athletics  laura athletics oh really thats not what it was i moved it  liam it was 14 i saw it  laura oh no 12  matt it takes you a little bit to get up there its steep you slide down a few times but  eventually because theres no immediate threat youre given time to /dung/ get up onto this upper  platform you can see that there are these various parts of the rock that jut outward that have some  short term passageways that this creature uses  laura im so weak but im holding to see if i see a cave  matt laughs roll a perception check  laura groans  matt once youre up there you take time and with help from some other folks you manage to harvest  id say about ten pounds worth of scales at most its not a whole lot a lot of it has been /none/ torn  and destroyed from the impact and damage you guys did parts of it are not really armory functional  but you manage to get enough to maybe make one set if somebody manages to work really well with it  marisha here grog bag of holding  laura 23  matt 23 currently you have no eye shot on any particular  sam dont eat it grog  matt  tunnels nothing that resembles an abode or a cavern from this position  taliesin lick it  laura groans  liam i see my sisters struggling  laura /none/ oh god it hurts  liam i climb up next to her  laura youre almost as weak as i am dude  liam yeah  laura here we go  liam acrobatics what is it  matt athletics  laura athletics  travis

up a little bit  matt it takes most of your short rest you will not be able to use your hit dice for healing on  this because you /none/ spend your time harvesting instead but you manage to thankfully the  damage that grog had inflicted upon its head destroyed most of its matter right up to the  throat gland which is mostly untouched its salvageable you dont know how much its worth  probably a decent amount as the book says that theyre rare especially to find intact  travis that grog what a dick  taliesin we have jars im going to put that into the jar and put it away  travis theres not even like a tooth like one broken tooth a piece  /none/ matt you did a number on that ones face  travis when grog goes to work  liam boom kill the behir take its glands money  taliesin i may have something i can do with this actually  travis with what the gland  taliesin yes  marisha maybe yes electricity noises  taliesin youre very clever yes well work on that  travis hello i dont speak your language  matt you place it within a preservation jar  taliesin yes  matt back in the bag of holding  taliesin back in the bag of holding  /none/ matt okay  taliesin im going to try and fix this mess for a minute  matt go ahead and make your check  taliesin 18  matt 18 it does cost you half the  taliesin it wasnt a dual fail  matt oh right just a single fail it was a dual fail but it was separate  taliesin yes  matt you take some time with it during the short rest to tinker with it you manage to bend the  metal back in place test it for a bit make sure the aspects that move move /none/ smoothly as they  should eventually you get pretty confident that it is back to a functional piece of weaponry all  right so as you guys finish this rest  travis im rolling one more hit dice  matt go for it the sky is starting to get a little bit into the orangish color though you can  not see the sun from its current location you gather you have about an hour and a half or so  before full sundown  sam lets get out of this little taco in case that was the daughter of /none/ something else  matt wait you guys stayed the night never mind in the cavern  so actually no i take that back  sam oh  matt i just realized you guys stayed the night last time over on the  seaside cavern and walked here  travis thats right  matt  and it only took you a few hours to get here so no itd be about midday noon  travis okay  matt so i take that back never mind  liam ah  sam we should still go  matt can see the sun it /town/ is straight above  taliesin we should still get out of the taco  matt there is some cloud cover coming in  travis definitely should still leave  matt from the north side it doesnt look like anything too dense  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha do you know how much longer we need to continue on this path  taliesin honestly ive never taken this road before this is further east than ive ever come  marisha can we see how far ahead does it look like it goes on for a while this chasm  /none/ matt it moves around so its hard to get to much of a visual of the  taliesin the geology starting to look familiar  laura does my tracking tell me anything  matt you can go ahead and make a nature check  liam for all of this id like to  matt with advantage  liam  walk about 40 feet in front of everyone and creep along  matt okay  laura 17  liam cloak up  matt make a stealth check  sam hes a weird loner that guy  travis he is  liam /none/ its my job  matt make a stealth check the mountains here got its name for the white stone mountains  the rock  taliesin its starting to look like home though  matt yeah the mountain range here is a large part of the material that is mined well was  mined beneath the its very rare white quartzlike rock that is used for many purposes  and its generally only found in this mountain range its what a lot of the whitestones  original economy was based on  liam 22  matt 22 good to know all /none/ right so  laura 17 on nature  matt okay i mean you gather the same thing the rock formations here match the same as the coastal  mountains the mountain here is all made of the same material few deposits here and there of just  normal bits of granite and other forms of simple stone  laura granite  sam oh  laura simple stone  all laugh  travis that was so much better than shopping  all laugh  matt as you guys are pressing forward at this point you guys are taking your time waiting /none/ and  tiberius is getting impatient and is crossing his arms i feel like i should have gotten more  materials i dont think im quite prepared enough for this  laura what tiberius you prepared a lot  liam tibs  matt not enough never enough  liam you brought along a sack of mirrors i think youve got enough what do you need  matt i have an idea ill be back in a few days  all what no  sam dont leave  matt he sits down and starts making his teleportation circle  laura no /none/ no we need that  liam tiberius  laura we need that  liam tiberius  laura we need that tiberius  liam you are a heavy hitter we dont know where were going what were doing hes strong youre  strong in a way maybe hang out a little bit longer  laura hes actually got a lot of hit points really  travis yeah hes got a lot  matt laughs  liam more than i do youre stronger in frame than i am sure you want to go  matt tiberius leans in and whispers to you /none/ in a strange tongue and it sparks in your ear  somewhere whispers the players not here and the dms trying to not make it too complicated for  him to keep track of an additional character for this session  all laugh  laura i understand that  liam whispers i know but im just trying to give you a hard time  all laugh  matt ill remember that  laura oh no  taliesin i grab lockheed and we hold him hostage  all laugh  marisha you cant leave  all laugh  laura we need /none/ you  matt dont worry ill be back soon and now i know how to find you  liam whispers send an ipad with pike on it  all laugh  matt he finishes his teleportation circle and with a whoosh with a flash vanishes  laura shit really tiberius really  marisha he does that a lot  sam its very much in his character  laura groans  travis whered tiberius go  liam he went to get an army i think  laura groans  travis thats fine  taliesin or more mirrors  marisha it might /none/ be more mirrors  taliesin or an army with mirrors  marisha an army with mirrors  liam i can do magic i do this great coin trick thing where i flip it on my thumb and then it  lands in my hand  laura and then you pull it  liam thats the end of it  laura  out of someones ear  liam its right here  laura whoa  travis we start walking  marisha thats fun  taliesin yeah no im walking  matt progressing forward  marisha its a start  matt  /none/ you begin to  travis jauntily stealth ahead  liam 40 feet out yeah  travis like a beagle  laura i keep a perception out to see anything  taliesin im keeping an eye open for anything familiar  sam can i just bump into vex and ask her to maybe scan ahead for dragons  laura what do you think im doing  sam dragons though six miles  laura im scanning  sam dont you have six miles of dragons or something thank you  taliesin do you have to do the hands  travis is that /none/ your scanning face  matt its good to help out in the  laura im thinking  sam six miles of dragons  laura im wanting to see if i see any dragons do i see any dragons  travis i thought you did a different technique last time  matt you take a moment and anticipate the circumstance and there is within whats the  distance on it  all six miles  matt six miles  liam yeah man  matt you ascertain that there are quite a few sources of life in this vicinity of some sort /none/ of  dragon kin or dragonlike entity  laura was the behir a dragony sort of thing  matt no technically not from what you can gather but you do gather there are a few blips  that are three miles off north at the center of the mountain range you dont know how big or how  dangerous but you sense there are some dragon or dragon kin sources  laura theres a dragony something  sam could be dragon eggs  marisha dragonborn  laura i dont know scanlan  marisha youre not picking up tiberius six miles /none/ away  laura theres dragony things though  sam listen when i poo somewhere i can see everything  laura i didnt poo im sensing with my mind  travis listen if we do run across a dragon remember we have the dragon slayer longsword  which is a plus one to attack and damage rolls and if you hit a dragon or a dragon creature it  gets an extra 3d6 of damage  laura what are you reading how did you even know that  taliesin thats the most complicated sentence i think ive ever heard you speak /none/  travis sorry i blacked out for a little bit  all laugh  taliesin nothing  laura nothing youre good grog  travis what do you have to do to attunement  matt attunement you take a short rest with the weapon learning its properties  travis caressing it  matt essentially stroking it making sure it feels comfortable  taliesin buying it dinner  matt nice spread so it feels welcome  travis thats more than i usually do  laura maybe a steak some salad shrimp cocktail  travis just in case you need a sword  /none/ liam as we progress i say into my earring scanlan ive seen some of the logs shes left  behind theyre not small  laura gasps you are seriously what  taliesin wow  laura thats disgusting  travis i missed it it must be good though  sam she usually buries them quite well  laura really gross both of you enough  liam they dont sense anything  sam all right  taliesin well were not heading north  sam were not  matt you guys are heading eastish  taliesin westish were heading westish  laura nothing /none/ that i can sense  travis can we keep walking  matt you guys came up on the eastern side sorry the western side of the mountains youre  now heading eastward  taliesin oh we came up on the western side of the mountains  laura theres nothing that were going to run across  liam just flip that  marisha western side of the mountains  taliesin western side of the mountains so whitestones to the east  matt whitestone would be to the east of you guys  taliesin oh okay i thought we went up the /none/ eastern side of the mountains im so confused  you wouldnt think id lived here before  matt that would have brought you through the forest and you were trying to avoid that thats  what i thought you said last time  taliesin no thats very true oh god  travis west sides on the shore side right oceans there  matt theres a giant peninsula to the north either side would have been coast  laura so were not going to run into any dragons  sam at least were not going north  matt youre aware that /town/ theyre not anywhere close to you to currently be an issue no  laura okay were fine  taliesin in two or three miles well take another check  laura yeah  travis laughs he winked at me  matt all right so  travis its like being blessed  sam were going to just keep going towards the town  matt you guys press on following this winding path that narrows at certain points and then  widens for a bit you come across partway through the twins at the front notice around the  edges as it begins /none/ to descend down into the beginning of the valley descent you see an edge  of the mountain that looks more angular than the usual natural formations of it it almost looks  like it comes to a point like a very sharp edge and a smooth side  liam im not sure i understand we see a dropoff  matt it begins to descend towards the valley and on the side of one of the giant  travis chasms  matt chasm you guys are at the bottom of you see an outcropping ahead thats angular and pointed  /none/ sam like designed by man  matt like it was sculpted constructed  travis that might have sentries  liam some sort of outlook or something something that was not formed by nature here  taliesin do i know what this is  matt you  taliesin history check  matt id say make an intelligence check roll and add your intelligence modifier  travis i could do it with you if you want  matt you can make a history check you know many things that exist here in the mountains but at  this distance you dont see /none/ enough of it to actually  laura shocked noise  travis hes not going to let me do it  laura he rolled a natural 20  matt for  travis an intelligence check because im an idiot  sam he doesnt know the  taliesin i kind of want grog to speak truth right here  laura hes an expert on mountains  matt actually this works out interestingly as you guys are walking forward and youre seeing  this and youre keeping back grog you instinctively look over and go oh thats a  stone giant fortress  /none/ all oh  marisha shut up  travis laughs i did something smart  all laugh  matt with your bloodline and knowing where you come from and youve had a few close encounters  in the cliffkeep mountains with a few of this kind youve seen a few fortresses and from the  details of it the way of the roof and the scope of its design and the way the mountain range  lends itself to that type of topography yeah this is obviously a stone giant fortress  travis oh and i drank some of that nasty /none/ dank in the fight with the hammer round two  sam wait should we those are bad guys right  travis yeah thats bad  sam we should not go that way  laura we should definitely stay away from that  travis maybe go up on the other side of the chasm opposite of it  matt or you can move around the side youre welcome to  laura maybe hide and make sure were hideyhidey  sam we could stealth through it we could invisible through it  marisha pass without a trace  travis pass without a /none/ trace  laura i have pass without a trace  travis and climb along the opposite side  laura and do we have invisibiloh no  taliesin no we dont no  laura you have  sam i have some invisibility not great though  travis i have dust of tracelessness  laura maybe well stealth it  liam can i hide scanlan under my cloak can he use his invisibility on someone else  matt if he was to cast invisibility on you  liam no on somebody else so id just hide him  travis what about one /none/ of those things that always works on me  matt you could  travis  a diversion  matt you would move very slow and you would have disadvantage on your stealth checks because you  guys dont have a way to move quietly  liam all right all right  laura no i dont want to bring any attention  marisha i could create a diversion  sam what kind  laura like what  marisha i mean i could whats nearby is anything nearby any animals have we seen any  wildlife  matt there have been birds /none/ that fly through an occasional harpy in the distance you hear  screeching and you guys keep quiet until it vanishes and disappears  screech in the background music  taliesin wow  travis that was perfect timing  laura howd that happen how did that frickin happen  travis his ways are mysterious my love  laura you are magic  matt i am lucky  taliesin holy cow  matt what were some seafaring like seagulls and various coastal birds have slowly been  disappearing and turning into more eagles and hawks things that eat small rodents more /none/ of a  lush side of the hill you see as you get closer to the valley itself that the actual forest that  surrounds whitestone is more and more of these birds of prey are beginning to show up other than  that you see very few small things other than occasional lizards about that big in your hand  that live on hot rocks  taliesin should we observe this encampment for a bit just to see whats happening as we slowly  make our way around it  laura can we see any kind of movement its /none/ really far away or  travis couldnt hurt  matt its still a ways away right now youre just catching the edge of it  sam are we a mile away a thousand feet away  matt id say youre about a good 600 700 feet from it  liam thats not that far  travis you know we could try to work our way up the opposite side of the chasm  taliesin that would also allow us a good view of it as well  marisha i happen to have hallucinatory terrain right now  sam what does /none/ that even mean  marisha it means exactly what it sounds like  sam i dont speak your language  marisha i can make terrain thats not real  liam do you remember when we psyched out the duergar  sam it would block their view of us maybe perhaps  laura is it movable  travis yeah it cant move with us  marisha it could block their view of us  liam can you make some shrubs to come along with us  matt you guys actually used it previously to camp for a night along a cliffside /none/  laura right  matt and made the cliff extend further than it was  liam yeah we lured a bunch of duergar into a chasm that the ground extended over  laura lets try to climb up the other side and then see what we can see  marisha i mean i can do a lot of things i can make a thunderstorm i can make a sleet storm  sam that would keep them in their fortress  travis could you make it fire  marisha i could  taliesin or very cold if they came out  /none/ laura they like cold  taliesin oh yes  marisha i could i could make a big storm  travis were also on a chasm so if it gets wet and slippery and muddy we might all go down  taliesin thats true  laura maybe get up at the top of it and then do this  taliesin i like the plan of going up the other side of the chasm  laura can we try to climb the other side  matt certainly  liam giants like to throw fucking boulders  laura yeah i dont wanna be /dung/ down on the bottom  liam yeah  matt as you guys make your way up the other side youre helping each other i want everyone to go  ahead and make an athletics check  sam i put on my climbing gear which i definitely own  marisha an athletics check  matt okay giving you advantage on your athletics check  laura i actually own climbing gear too does that help  matt that would help you yes  laura okay  travis i have mine too so ill put that on as well  marisha i dont /none/ know if i have climbing  taliesin i dont know if i have climbing gear  travis attached to a rope and a grappling hook thats in my hand  sam and it was the same laughs  matt all right so  sam what am i doing adding what  travis fuck yeah nipple tits  matt you have advantage you add your strength modifier or your athletics is what it would be  sam athletics  laura do we add anything because of the climbing gear or is it  matt you get advantage because of the climbing /none/ gear  laura ah thats important  travis 26  matt 26  liam we were all using climbing gear or just  matt no those who have it  laura i give you my climbing gear because i already get advantage how about that does that  count no  matt because it is mountain all right ill let you do that  laura all right  liam all right well i got 19  matt 19  laura oh so you dont need that  liam yes i do i need it  sam 11  travis 26 /none/  matt 26 vex what did you get  laura i got 15  marisha 11  taliesin 19  matt okay a couple of missteps and almost sliding keyleth at one point you grasp her by  the hand and grog pulls her back up onto the platform  travis no no up here  marisha thanks grog  matt over time you guys make your way along this very rocky and precarious anywhere from five to  three to two feet in width sometimes even lesser than that and you guys are having to shimmy  across you /none/ make your way around and you can see this large fortress that is built out of extremely  large and inplace stones and stonework it looks ancient for sizewise its two stories for a  giant which means its probably close to six or seven stories of height  laura whoa  matt built into the side of a mountain and it goes down almost like two giant steps its built  on essentially where the giant bowl the caldera if you will of where this valley of this mountain  range would be its built on the inside of /none/ it so its actually constructed as you continue to descend  into the valley looking at it you can see openings windows there are areas up top where  you see giant piles of rocks and boulders that are used for antisiege for throwing off the top  stockpiles of that you do see boulders around the ground that may have been thrown and not picked  up everyone make a perception check  laura i feel whispers should i say  liam whispers im not gonna tell you  taliesin thats an intimidation check  laura how did trinket /none/ get up the cavern  matt hm  laura can trinket climb  matt trinket  taliesin bears climb  marisha bears are good climbers  laura theyre good climbers  taliesin they can get up a tree  marisha yeah  matt roll an athletics check with disadvantage  sam disadvantage  laura im sorry but it felt wrong to lie  matt rangers  sam of course its an honor system  liam could i have given the climbing gear to trinket  laura no  travis no  all laugh  taliesin you couldve it just wouldve /none/ been adorable  laura but we could tie the rope around trinkets waist  matt roll your dice  laura with an athletics check  matt yes  laura does he get an advantage because of mountains  marisha i love that he says roll your dice like it matters  matt nope he gets disadvantage because hes a big bear  travis i told her not to say it whyd you say it  laura im just trying to be honest  matt which is appreciated  laura strength modifier he got a 15 too  matt okay its /none/ been difficult and it slowed your guys progression but youve managed to keep  trinket along with you this large bear is now like pushing against the side hes managed to  keep up but its been a harrowing experience  liam ive been behind him the whole time pushing on his buttocks  matt yeah  laura you got this buddy you got this  matt so once again perception rolls  laura sorry yes  taliesin 20  marisha 19  sam 17  liam can i use passive perception  matt this is active actually looking for /none/ something the passive is more  liam well then i get 26  travis 15  laura 19  matt all right you got 26 you said  liam yep  matt looking from this distance and keeping the best visual you can see there is no movement at  all from the interior of the fortress the two front doors you see these two large stone doors  that are the entrance to it one of the doors is actually broken in half and left  partially ajar and open  travis we gotta go in now  laura /none/ no no no  sam they could be dead in there  laura if something couldve taken out giant giants what could it be that couldve done that  travis vampire giants  taliesin it couldve been the briarwoods we should see everything thats up here  sam sings there are giants in the sky  travis how awesome would that be  laura sings there are big tall terrible giants in the sky  travis can we please go see can someone please  sam you want me to go in  travis vax  marisha i can bird /none/ it i can bird it and go in  taliesin i cant believe im about to say this  marisha bird in and do a recon mission real quick  sam youre going to bird in theyre going to see you fly in  laura no but shes a bird  marisha im a bird  sam it doesnt matter theyre still gonna see you  laura recon it  marisha ill go bat  laura yeah  taliesin now youre not going to be able to see anything because they have terrible eyesight  marisha not in a small /none/  taliesin im kidding they really dont thats a myth thats actually a myth  marisha they have echo vision  taliesin they have actually very reasonable eyesight thats a myth you can look it up on  wikipedia its true  marisha laughs very reasonable eyesight  liam you could also be a sparrow  laura and marisha yeah  matt so at about the two in the afternoon day sun cause thats what it is but youre fine  you become a bat  marisha bats come out during the day  matt i know she makes her /none/ way down through you swoop up to one of the windows and you glance  inside and look around you can see most of the furniture inside is in tatters there are large  giantsized tables and chairs that have been broken in half and strewn across the room  make a perception check  laura ooh come on keyleth  sam come on oh yeah  taliesin oh yeah  marisha oh yeah 28  matt 28 glancing inside you also see there are  marisha squawks thats my echovision  matt  splatters and puddles of blood large /none/ bits of blood across the ground that is dried but  from your current vision from this there is no sign of any living or individuals or bodies there  was a battle that took place here but there is nothing present to signify who or what  marisha how big is this room  matt this room is about 25 feet tall  marisha does it look like it goes deeper  matt it does look like it goes deeper there is a slight this is the upper floor there is a  grade almost like a slow the /none/ word escapes me for a second  marisha like a downgrade  matt yes  taliesin like a ramp  matt a ramp  sam a slope  matt thank you  matt a ramp that disappears below and into the lower floor  sam a siggle  marisha im gonna go into that  all laugh  travis careful oh no no no no dont roll dont roll  all shout  taliesin we turn on him  marisha fear of god  liam grog sacrifices the gnome  all laugh  matt so yeah you do see the /none/ ramp thats downward  marisha im going to go into the room that i see is for sure empty and go  toward the threshold of the ramp  matt okay make your way down to the threshold of the ramp looking down downstairs as well it  looks like there are some fur rugs set aside that have been kicked aside and bunched up on the edge  of the room  marisha like its been ransacked or just a really nasty fight  matt like some sort of a major fight went down no sign of any bodies /none/ or body parts no sign of  leftover weapons or armor from whatever giants lived in here you just see large amounts of dried  blood across the stone floors  marisha like something came in and slaughtered and completely stripped the place  matt or the giants slaughtered something horribly here and are currently out and about you dont  know but  marisha can i tell if the blood looks how dusty is this shit  matt did you want to land and make an investigation check  sam call us in  travis do it  liam /none/ do it batwoman  taliesin you are the night  marisha how much dust goes pff  travis laughs you are the night  matt quite a bit a little puff  laura oh  matt not a huge amount but enough where its not fresh and a closer look the bloods been dry for  a while make an investigation check  taliesin what is the sound of a bat coughing  marisha squawking and coughing noise  taliesin thank you its the simple things  travis what did you get  marisha investigation what about a 12  /none/ matt 12 you cant really make it out unfortunately you know its dried its been a  little bit but you cant quite gauge how long its been  marisha all right im gonna go ahead and are there any other rooms or is this it  matt theres the upper floor the lower floor theyre two large rooms on their own it looks  like you havent actually gone down the grade yet so  marisha you said seven stories so its like room downgrade room downgrade room  matt seven stories for your size its two stories for /none/ a giant size its a large top room  and a large bottom room  laura ooh  marisha is there another room going off the bottom room  matt there are just two rooms top floor bottom floor youre currently  on the top floor looking down  sam split level condo  marish im gonna go out to the front door  matt okay  marisha nice flat upper east side land and im gonna bamf out of my bat form and say all right  it looks like the coast is clear if you guys want to /none/ check this place out  sam yeah lets go check in  taliesin lets check it out  matt all right the rest of you make you way back down towards the front of the fortress and enter  the inside as you go through the front door you see that the impact that  destroyed it was from the inside out  sam oh  laura ooh  travis really  matt so its not like it was beaten in it was beaten from the inside out  laura oh  matt and there is a streak of dried /none/ blood against that portion of the door looking inside too you  see there are a large cluster of matted hides and furs like it made for bedding for close to four  or five giants put in the corner and there is a musty smell of whatever they were using to make it  comfortable and ripe for their own personal needs  liam stealth  laura yeah yeah lets stealth  travis can giants become vampires  laura i dont know i hope not you should use the dust of tracelessness grog just so our  footsteps arent /dung/ seen  liam 17  matt 17 okay so what do you guys want to do in here  laura stealth  sam im going to go downstairs  marisha how dark is it  matt you are downstairs at the entrance  sam oh down the grade i mean  travis i want to look for any weapons that are lying about  matt all right make a perception check  liam i want to ransack the joint  matt actually itd be more of an investigation check  travis me investigate thats funny eight  matt okay  /none/ liam investigate or perception for me  travis i find dirt  matt you find a giants fortress  liam investigate or perception  matt for this perception is just seeing things at first glance investigation is going through  and rummaging through to find things  liam ill investigate  matt okay  sam shall i for downstairs  matt yeah go for it  liam 17  sam 23  matt okay as you guys are going through looking at the blood and the way the splashes are the  blood that was spilled here was very thick /none/ and large amounts of it and its probably been  anywhere from two to three months since this entire fortress was ransacked  travis wow  matt you do notice that some of the blood is dragged through like something was dragged  out of the puddle but not for a long distance whatever was there was cleaned off at  some point or lifted up and carried out from whatever was originally pulled through those  puddles of blood you also do notice that in the pile of furs and refuse and there are bones of  things that /none/ were left there to rot in the corner you find roughly 120 gold pieces  sam i give it to vex  matt over time you find a number of shattered glass vials that look like they once contained  various elixirs there is one that is unshattered  sam i take it  matt all right and underneath all covered in quite a bit of filth but a little bit of metallic  sheen streaks through you see what looks to be a very very wellcrafted longbow  laura gasps what is that what is it what did you /none/ find  sam nothing nothing  laura what is it what is that  liam here you go  laura ah what is this  liam what are you going to do with it  laura what is this  sam ill use it as a hammock  liam shoot yourself  marisha does it look like its magicy  laura can i tell what it is  matt taking it it appears to have some sort of magical radiance to it it looks like its very  well crafted you recognize the construction is elvish in nature  laura /none/ hey look at this  matt and there are bits of mithril scrolling all throughout the bow itself with platinum caps on  the edge of the longbow  travis is it evil  laura i dont know keyleth do you know anything about magicy stuff tiberius bamfed out  marisha i can try im not as good as he is but ill try  laura what about you scanlan do you know anything about arcana  marisha ooh 20  matt natural 20  marisha no 18 20 total  matt yes this is definitively a magical item it /none/ is enchanted  marisha its definitely magical  matt if you want to take a short time to work with it and attune yourself to it you could get a  better idea of what its effect is  laura okay thank you can we do that  taliesin im going to look around a bit more anyway  laura im going to think about it real hard  liam probably shoot a couple dummy arrows out of it  travis can i walk out the front door  laura im going to buy it a steak and im going /none/ to  travis can i walk out the front door and keep post on the porch  liam im following grog and im doing the same  matt all right  travis and i want to look in the direction we want to be walking  taliesin im looking around im trying to find out what happened to the bodies  matt investigation check for that  here are the potion and the bow you guys managed to  laura what is it what is it  sam i took the potion i took the potion  matt laughs give /none/ that to scanlan  taliesin i know apparently from this roll that im in the mountains  laura what is it  taliesin i got a six  matt a six its hard to tell its a very strange scene and you have no inclination as to  what may have transpired here who is the winner who is the loser and  what has been done with the bodies  liam sorry  marisha what did you find what did you find  taliesin vex is making happy noises  liam shes taking the bow for a spin  /none/ travis shes attuning  liam seeing what it can do  travis do we see anything outside on the porch  matt over time the only thing you catch is occasionally you see flocks of birds moving through and  swooping through the area you watch one flock come up and begin circling a little bit  laura should we get out should we leave  matt and then make its way down toward the valley  travis stealth  laura just leave lets leave stealth it out stealthy outie  matt this is for grog who is outside roll /none/ a stealth check  liam im out there too and i rolled a natural 20  matt yes you did  travis i might use your inspiration on this  sam its probably not in effect anymore  laura groans no youre in the mountains  travis i am in the mountains  matt which means you have knowledge of mountains  laura you dont get advantage  travis i dont have advantage on  matt let me doublecheck on this actually what the specifics of the goliaths you dont take  issues with cold climates because youre at high /none/ elevation you dont actually get advantage on  anything mountainwise that is a ranger ability  travis so can i add an inspiration on this  sam i inspired him quite a while ago how long does that  matt its been a while how long does that last  sam 20 minutes  matt yeah that wouldve faded by now  travis thats a one  matt oh well if its a natural one it wouldnt have mattered  liam yeah it doesnt matter you cant add shit to one  matt so while you sneak off to the /none/ side you see these birds theres a lot of birds there you  start yelling out to everyone theres a lot of birds out here  shouting it loudly back into the fortress  laura aw shit  marisha grog grog those might be centurion birds  travis loudly thats what i said birds  marisha they might be spies they might be spies  travis loudly yeah i spy birds theyre flying everywhere yells go away  laura grog grog inside  marisha inside  matt the birds immediately start circling the fortress very close you can hear the /none/ screeching  you can see the birds now theyre crows a very very thick murder of crows probably close to a  hundred of them cawing  laura i cast pass without a trace  marisha wait wait wait  sam im still down there investigating  matt mmhm  sam i pull a david caruso and say it looks like these giants had big trouble  all laugh  matt you hear an echoing sound yeahhhh formless sourceless you all stand there confused  for a moment then continue to try and stealth  travis i run back inside /none/  matt back inside eventually the crows take back to their original path  marisha oh oh but before the crows leave before the crows leave  liam yeah  laura yeah  marisha can i do something  matt yep what are you doing  laura do it  travis do it  sam kill them all  marisha im gonna go like storm and im gonna sleet storm them im gonna start conjuring a  sleet storm over the top of this mountain right where the crows are  taliesin its been so long since youve killed something /none/ innocent lets bring it  laura do it do it keyleth  matt as keyleth concentrates for a second you see her eyes the actual color of her irises  begin to fade to this cloudy white and then the entire eye itself becomes this icy blue a slight  cold mist beginning to drift off the corners of her face  laura badass  matt you start hearing this pounding sound on the top of the fortress as sleet and hail begins to  rain down go ahead and roll damage for the spell  marisha oh jeez  /none/ matt sleet storm oh its just a dexterity saving throw it says heavily obscured but  doesnt actually do any damage  laura but it knocks them all down  marisha i know theyre like frozen though right dont they get frozen with sleet storm  matt sleet storm knocks things prone makes the area hard to see  marisha knocks them prone  matt douses flames  marisha theyre in the sky i wanna hear birds hit the floor  matt and a few do there are a few birds that get pelted and knocked to the ground encased /none/ in  sleet but most of it immediately takes note to get away from the storm and vanish  and disappear back to  travis do they fall to the porch  matt ill say one does  travis i run out there and i grab it  laura no no no  travis i rip its head off with my teeth  all laugh  matt grog you run out there and grab the one on the ground its struggling and squawks  theres ice gathered everywhere  travis yeah shut up  matt you grab it and you /none/ pick it up you hear vex go grog and you go chomp as shes staring at  you silencing the crow you hear the cawing of the crows dissipate in the distance and silence  eventually takes the fortress once again and youre left amongst the smell of death  laura we should get the eff out of here  marisha i think so  taliesin we should probably leave  laura now stealth and out  laura dust of tracelessness hide ourselves  travis dust of tracelessness  matt you make your way out of the fortress and begin /none/ to follow the path down into the outside of  the forest and just as you make towards the base of the mountains where the forest canopy begins to  take your vision you can see just over the edge a couple of small castle towers and what looks to  be a single central spire of the castle of whitestone  laura they know were here now they know were here  liam yeah  taliesin i think they might  laura that was a sentry  travis why they were just birds  marisha yeah but we dont /none/ know  sam dont worry we still have the element of surprise oh wait no we dont  matt and with that were going to go ahead and take a break all right guys well be back here  in about 2025 minutes  laura oh yeah  matt let us begin where we left off  laura oh were looking at the city  sam theres the city shall we storm it  taliesin its a chalkboard  laura i was pointing at you  taliesin well yes so i can now recognize where we are  matt yes /none/ you know this area very well this entire forested area the parchwood forest that  encompases the entirety of this valley toward the center of it center north is where whitestone  sits and for your reference as well since youve been here before  you would know the city relatively well  sam maps  taliesin this is the most exciting map ive ever been handed whoa  laura what the what  matt hold that over by your seat there for people to take a look at  sam dont just dont  taliesin it wont fit in /town/ my folder  matt that is a basic rundown of the size design and shape of whitestone with castle whitestone  toward the top built on top of a leveled off mountain that marks the southernmost point  sam this is the castle this is the town  travis and were at the southern part of that  matt you guys are actually coming in from what would be the northwestern side of the city  marisha so over here  matt a little bit further down about that angle there thats the direction  youre coming in from  /none/ travis thats a detailed map man  matt i dont have any free time anymore  all laugh  travis they sell those stock right  matt oh yeah totally  taliesin whats this little outcropping  mat the little outcropping to the east of it was the graveyard to whitestone its where most of  the regular denizens were interred its been expanded over the years as the city itself has  been around for quite a few generations  marisha does this graveyard have catacombs tombs underground passages  matt do you ask this of percy  marisha /none/ yes  taliesin does it  matt that graveyard does not taliesin that graveyard does not  matt  it is a surface graveyard taliesin  it is a surface graveyard  matt there is a mausoleum taliesin there is a mausoleum  matt  but that taliesin  but that  matt  is actually contained beneath the castle taliesin  is actually contained beneath the castle  all laugh  travis riveting  sam so knowledgeable percy  laura so percy do you know of any secret passages to get actually into the castle  taliesin i was /none/ wondering that myself  matt there is one one that you took to escape  taliesin yes there is one  marisha laughs stop  matt he has an aneurysm yeah it is to the very western edge of the mountain precipice the castle  was built on it was built to be specifically an escape in case the place was under siege  unfortunately the circumstances that the evening happened so rapidly and with creatures that  seemingly were unnatural the family didnt have time to make it out and even you werent fully  aware of it cassandra /town/ however had overheard discussions about the passage and took that as your  escape route its a hidden tunnel at the very base of the mountain  taliesin i say we scope out the hidden entrance see if its guarded  see if theyve discovered it  sam to the town or to the castle  taliesin the hidden entrance to the castle instead of using it i think we should possibly  spend the night and get a view of the town see if theres anything unusual  laura i agree can we camp out and hide  sam /town/ watch from afar whats that going to tell us  travis we could send one in  taliesin we could send a bird in or an invisible gnome  sam or both  taliesin or both an invisible birdgnome  travis just to see if the town is normal or not  sam it could be all vampires or it could be a totally normal town  taliesin if its all vampires itll be empty right now  sam and laura because its daytime  marisha we should do a flyby  laura we should definitely attack during the day /none/  taliesin yes  travis we should send one by air and one by land  laura what  marisha do you want to do that  sam how far away are we  matt you guys have been travelling through the forest and it is a very dense forest but it is  mostly coldweather trees pines and there is you can see once you get inside the forest the  ground itself is very thick and there are elements of melting snow on the top of the trees there was  recently a snowfall in this area but /none/ it seems like its been a while and most of it has turned to slush  and water you have about two hours of travel into the forest and you all immediately catch the  sound of distant howling  sam is it nighttime  matt no  sam oh thats scary  marisha distant howling does it sound like wolves can i make a nature check  matt yeah make a nature check  laura stealth  matt if you want to make a stealth check  marisha 26  matt 26 those are wolves it sounds like a /none/ pack of wolves probably close to  anywhere from five or six  marisha would i think its weird that theyre howling during the daytime  matt you gather that it is strange that theyre out though it is getting later in the day you  are pushing four or five in the afternoon the sun is starting to get closer to the horizon it is  strange that theyre out this early youre not sure what the reasoning would be for that  marisha odd  taliesin i say we hide in the trees  laura up high  /town/ travis like up in the trees  laura i like it  travis were gonna climb some trees  matt okay  liam were gonna hobbit this shit  sam were just hiding in the trees were not going in to investigate  taliesin well its about to be nighttime so well send a scout  sam how long would it take to get into the town from where we are  matt about two more hours of travel  sam ew well get there at night thats all right though its early evening  marisha how long would it /town/ take me to fly over if i was a bird  matt about an hour  sam vax  liam yes  sam can i ride you into town  liam you want me to jog into town  marisha you could ride me into town  sam well hello lady  marisha man every time scanlan every time  taliesin now that just got weird  laura could you turn yourself and fly  sam yeah i guess i could fly  marisha you wanna go invisible and jump on my back and i can eagle up  sam /town/ whatever youre into baby laughs ive become austin powers  laura ridiculous  marisha lets do it  liam if the coach driver was any indication there are going to be people  laura normal people  liam  in town  sam what about this ill make us both invisible and you fly us in  laura i like it  travis yeah get on the ground not just above  matt all right now invisibility how long does it last at full duration  sam looking up to an hour ooh and it takes two hours just to /none/ get there  matt well flying takes an hour so its one of those things you could do once you approach it  itll last you awhile as opposed to doing it now  sam how long can you be polymorphed for forever concentration  marisha for half of my druid level we discovered  matt so somewhere around six hours five hours  sam okay so you fly us in and ill invisibility us right as we get to the gates  travis and as theyre going out we get in the trees  taliesin make sure you bring /none/ an earpiece  marisha hes got an earpiece  travis do we the four of us all go up in the trees  liam everyone get your own tree  laura everyone get your own tree  matt everyone whos in a tree please roll a stealth check  sam except for trinket who cant climb up  laura trinket can climb trees bears climb trees  matt roll an athletics check  laura im casting pass without a trace how long does it last  sam you have to roll for trinket  laura okay fine i guess ill /none/ cast it tonight never mind  travis plus ten to stealth  laura why are you being a dick scanlan  matt well she did not cast it  laura im not casting it yet  travis 14  laura what are we rolling  travis stealth  liam i already did those are good rolls  laura 21 for me and what do i just nothing 19 for trinket  matt okay well say you guys all manage to slowly get yourself up into the tree the best you  can as you guys take off while you guys /none/ are away making your way towards whitestone the rest  of you look down and just from a passive perception standpoint you pick up the most  detail you can see there is indeed a pack of about five wolves andor dogs a little ways away  but theyre being followed by one humanoid theyre being guided there is a pack out here for  some reason whether it be a hunting party or whatever other reasons there may be  it isnt a wild pack  laura and theyre close to us now  travis ive been doing the /none/ dust of tracelessness  laura so ill cast it on us now that theyre closer  marisha i wonder if thats the ground search party  laura maybe  travis well see  laura so should we add ten to all of our stealth rolls that had been or do we have to roll again  matt youd have to roll again  laura shit balls  liam so were stealthing again in the tree  matt because shes casting pass or you wont get the benefit  liam im already at a 32 man  travis ill take it /none/  laura you dont have to  liam lets do it lets roll again  taliesin lets roll again  liam what do we add  laura ten to whatever we roll  matt go ahead and just add ten to the previous roll  all cheer  liam good  marisha we want to keep our good rolls  matt so about five breathless moments pass as the dogs wolves all get relatively close one of  them comes up and returns back to the pack you dont get a good view of the individual that is  currently /none/ guiding the pack and you see them disappear between the thick trees in the distance  make an active perception check for you vex if you dont mind  laura not advantage mountains  matt is forest no youre in forest now  laura oh wait thats another  matt youre sure thats a favored terrain then go ahead and roll again  laura that was worse than the first one thats great  matt so your total is  liam i rolled 20  laura okay well you didnt say you were doing it 18  matt 18 okay /none/ its hard to make out the details at this distance you check out it does appear to  be a female form  laura oh its a chick  matt best you can tell you cant tell specific race or details then another minute passes  before the barking and the howls fade and the hunting party seems to have been eluded  taliesin there was no way to get a good look at who it was  matt no do you want to make an active perception check  taliesin actually i would love to  matt normally if /none/ theyd passed by now  taliesin natural 20  travis what really  matt a natural 20  marisha im looking at it  taliesin this is an i love you for those awful rolls earlier  travis the golden snitch wins again  taliesin that may be its name now  matt you see the female form its not someone you particularly recognize but the woman does  appear to be older probably in her late 40s early 50s she has some hunting gear over her  shoulder she has a short bow thats strapped over her she has /none/ a quiver of arrows she  looks like shes hunting for food  sam if she was a little older tiberius would kill her  all laugh  sam give her ten years  matt give her ten years  taliesin i dont recognize her though  matt no you dont have an immediate lead of visual recognition in the meantime you guys make  your way swooping down you can see that cluster that murder of crows circling out its making a  large pass over this entire valley you take this cue as you get to within visual /none/ range of the city  to cast invisibility on both of you is that a 3rdlevel spell  sam yes  matt okay both of you vanish from view which is a strange feeling for you because you cannot see  keyleth youre grasping onto something you cant see  sam oh shit  matt and you just look like youre gliding through the air  sam can i do one of these  matt yeah you grab on very tightly  marisha choking noises  matt  without choking the eagle does not have  sam damn it  /none/ matt  human physiology you get two fistfuls of feathers and you really dont want an eagle to  buck you angrily at this height i dont think you have featherfall so that wouldnt go well looking  over whitestone you can see outside of the city there are some areas where the trees are  carved out and there is farmland set up specifically to grow food and to till to maintain  sustenance for the people that live there you can see that theres a small area thats also being  cut for timber not a perpetual thing /none/ but the wood here is youve heard previously one of  the major exports here is very highquality timber from this type of tree that is used for very  exquisite woodcraft and furniture so thats one of the major exports of whitestone as well as the  quartz from the mines itself there are people in the city but sparse make a perception check  marisha can i also make a perception check  matt you may  marisha with my eagle vision  matt singsong you may  marisha 14 so thats 24 and i have keen sight /town/ which means  i have advantage on all perception checks  matt yes you do  marisha ill take that 14  taliesin shell take that 14  marisha as opposed to that one  matt total of 14  marisha 24  matt 24 okay as you get close enough to start scanning over details you can see that a lot of  the buildings appear to be closed or empty there are people working in the fields as you make your  way to the center of the town there is a town square there is a tree /none/ there a very large old  tree that is twisted with all these various gnarled branches that reach out you recall  desmond mentioning something called the sun tree that is the centerpiece of this area and you get  a view enough of the tree to see that there are eight humanoid bodies  of varying ages swinging from it  sam ooh  laura oh no  matt you also notice that patrolling through the city at very slow paces there are a few larger  than normal humanoids  laura gasps  matt you see what appear /town/ to be approximately six giants patrolling through the town but you can  see some of them are like wrecked and broken one of them is missing an arm and  is dragging a foot behind it  laura theyre zombie giants  matt apparently whenever one of them is moving through most of the denizens of the town keep a  very wide berth and generally avoid them entirely and go about their business at a distance  laura oh my god  liam i miss pike  travis six  sam no problem  matt like over all /none/ of the entire city theyre pretty well scattered about after you do a full  pass over the city those are most of the details you can make out at this height anything further  any specifics you want to go for before heading back  sam you want to set me down so i can go talk to people  marisha you want to talk to people  sam well or at least eavesdrop we dont know if theyre all vampires or not  marisha does it look like theres a central part where theres a lot of people /town/ gathered  matt farmlands look likely to be the largest cluster of people you can see since its getting  to the end of the day there are folks finishing up gathering the crops that were available to them or sort  of planting as they go through and you can see theres about five or six people that are all in  one group most everyone else seems to be relatively solitary and trying to go about their  business as fast as possible  marisha the town squares emptying out  matt the town square nobody is in /town/ the town square people are avoiding it like the plague  theres eight bodies hanging from the tree and nobody wants to be there  marisha all right im going to swoop down and find a tree where the five or six farmers are  and perch see if scanlan can get a good  matt there actually are no trees by the farm all the trees have been cleared out to make the  farmland so theres actually a bit of the forest thats been cleared for that purpose  marisha its just open and empty  matt yeah /none/ you can go to a tree thats nearby but thats like 300 feet away  marisha a rooftop a wall anything i can perch on  matt there is a wall there is a wall on the outskirts of whitestone  marisha i perch on the wall  matt okay you swoop down and you perch on the edge of the wall there its about 25 feet up  sam im just going to walk down there i wont be able to see you so im going to leave a little  marisha ill keep an oh wait i cant /none/ see you  matt and you cant talk right now youre an eagle  sam i leave a little like a canteen or something right where shes perched just so i  know where to find her  matt okay  travis smart  taliesin leave the mug  sam yeah my stein and then im going to walk down and see if i can stealthily  eavesdrop on some conversations  matt okay you make your way down the 25foot wall shes perched on  sam oh shit am i going to fall  matt go ahead and make /none/ an athletics check to climb  taliesin you say that out loud  sam athletics  matt yes  sam 17  matt 17 the stonework here is old and you manage to not lose your footing entirely as you bring  your way down thankfully youre light enough and the stones are not too large so you can get  some good handholds you do over the next 12 minutes or so  make your way to the base of the wall  sam it took me 12 minutes to climb 25 feet  matt yep  sam nice /none/ i suck  marisha maybe whistle for me when you come back  matt a lot of moments of gasps whoa okay but you catch yourself i mean you can just jump  if you wanted to make it less but the duration of your invisibility you have about 20 more  minutes before it dissipates  sam oh shit i have to do this quick  matt you look over the edge and you can see that they have carts up and that they have what  vegetables they have and a lot of vegetables even at a close /none/ look a lot of them look withered  it looks like there is a general sense of frustration that the land itself is not producing  quality crops and even the people look unhealthy and gaunt by nature whether it be the cold winter  recently or just their general spirit is broken but there is a feeling about these people that  life here is not what it used to be there isnt a whole lot of conversation theres mutterings here  and there we have to make sure we get these back in time fill the cart we /none/ have two carts we have  to get in and the other ones i know i know im trying and theyre putting it over there and  theres a little bit of frustration among them  sam hes doing walla  all laugh  matt one of them ends up counting the last bit of crop thats it thats all we have that is the  entire pull for the day and the older gentleman who is overseeing it grinds his hands and goes  sir kerrion is going to have my hide  sam wait wasnt that one of /none/ the people  matt at the very least lets gather it together and hopefully pelor will protect us and the  people take the carts and begin making their way towards the outer gate on the southeast side of  whitestone where you guys are currently at  sam okay im going to hustle back to the roof  matt all right make an athletics check  sam jesus  marisha i can come get you  taliesin youll hear a thump  sam eight  all laugh  liam hopefully he lands on his lute  sam no its /none/ nine  matt okay 15 minutes after five minutes of eavesdropping you realize that you are not going  to make it up that wall and you feel the magic of your invisibility illusion about to fade at this  point by the way the sun has just hit the edge of the mountains the sky itself is a vibrant  reddish orange slowly turning to purple and sunset is upon you  sam i want to spend the night here no  marisha can i see him  matt hes invisible no  sam i will sneak around the /dung/ corner a little bit wait for an opening and i lose invisibility  which will drop it on her as well and i will dimension door back up to the roof  matt okay as you pass to the side the illusion fades you step into a small opening of dark  purplish energy and then reemerge on the top of the wall  matt and sam grab the canteen  matt and hop back on the back of her  sam oh shit invisibility again  matt okay okay you guys vanish and keyleth you take off back in /none/ the direction you guys  traveled from in the meantime guys what do you want to have been doing are you just waiting are  you traveling further in are you staying where you are  travis snores  taliesin we have to wait  laura yeah keeping an ear out for the wolves and just chilling in a tree  travis yells i fall out of the tree  laura and also im restringing my new awesome bow  matt with the  laura with the blazing bowstring  matt okay  laura which by the way is a /none/ longbow of sky sentinel  sam sky sentinel what does that mean  laura once per long rest i can use a storm arrow which means that the next arrow i fire  splits into three arrows roll an attack for each of them they all get 1d6 extra for each one that  hits its amazing  sam every time you use it or is at a onetime  laura its one time per long rest  marisha thats awesome  matt once per day she fires an arrow and the arrow splits into three and each one bursts /none/ into  thunder damage bursts of them  laura say what so is it lightning damage or is it  matt thunder damage it should say on there  laura it says lightning damage  matt oh then it would be lightning damage  marisha its a taser arrow  taliesin its basically a taser  matt so yeah its pretty fun  sam thunder  laura thunder  matt whats that from  sam i dont know  matt so the night falls and the crickets begin to emerge the slow mist begins to form  laura wait our /none/ friends arent back yet its already night and theyre not back  liam i just want to say that i pulled my hood down and put on my calamari hat and pulled the  hood back over it  matt okay so you take the partially rusted over but functional metallic skull cap that clarota  was wearing when you guys met in the underdark that clarota no longer needs  travis because hes dead  matt you place it on your head and its a little loose as you place it on it rattles for a  moment and /none/ then it formfits to your skull your hair being pinched beneath it and just emerging  from underneath almost lokihelmetstyle  laura looking snazzy vax  travis nice bonnet  sam imitating clarota im on your head  matt theres a weird buzzing vibrational feel as its magic attunes to you over the next hour or so  as youre waiting but you get the sensation that it will offer some decent  protection from impeding charm effects  liam it tingles  laura it looks like you have a mullet  liam yeah dude  matt a loki mullet /none/ you start to get really nervous about the arrival of your friends until  eventually you hear the flapping of wings you look up and you can see since it has taken an  hour to get there the illusion just fades both a giant eagle and scanlan appear in the moonlight  right above the canopy of the forest you guys are close to and return to the place you were  laura keyleth question can you make it look like were not here with your foliage shit  marisha i drop my beast shape holding onto a branch /none/  laura you know the illusions  marisha yeah  taliesin good good  laura can we camp up in the tree so nobody can come towards us  marisha yeah  sam what if we fall out  marisha i druidcraft some spiderweb hammocks  laura ooh  taliesin sticky  marisha and as usual light some sage  matt takes about an hour or so but you manage to pull from the surroundings these really nice  thick spider silk hammocks that should be able to support your respective weights grog is the only  one that might /none/ be questionable with the sheer amount of weight that is his form  travis i like it  marisha maybe take a rope and tie it  travis nope this is a trust exercise  laura im using hide in plain sight to make me and trinket extra extra hidey  liam i have a question the only reason i have this question is because i posted that video from  a couple of years ago do i still have the unending rope  laura i have the unending rope motherfucker  liam why dont we reinforce with the rope /none/  laura sure why not  travis you dont like the trust exercise  laura thats where all the rope comes from that we ever use  liam im sorry i brought it up id love you to fall on your head  laura lets reinforce the spiderwebs  travis no im good thank you  marisha whoa vax nice helmet don quixote called  liam aerodynamic isnt it  marisha he wants his bowl back  sam before we slumber we did a little intel a little recon  laura oh yeah whats up  sam turns out the /town/ town is full of humans except for these six vampire giants zombie giants  marisha they all appear to be fairly miserable people  sam however this could be useful everyone in the town the farmers anyway seem to be gathering  produce to deliver to the briarwoods we could pose as some sort of farmer troupe with a basket  of goodies and maybe get through the front gate  laura dont you think they would know all the farmers around at this point theyve been there  for a long time  marisha they did reference sir kerrion /town/ by name oh they referenced sir kerrion percy  taliesin thank you  sam we could make ourselves look like some of them one of us has a hat of disguise  marisha also there was something other really important  sam what  marisha the town was pretty much empty  sam oh yes this  marisha and that sun tree that whatshisname who said that jarett  matt desmond  marisha desmond looks like there were some executions that took place there were about eight  bodies hanging from that tree  laura why is it called the /none/ sun tree  sam its really lovely i dont know maybe it gets sun  marisha i dont know why do they call it the sun tree  taliesin can i go with this unless you have a particular reason to  matt i mean you can go with there are maybe many reasons its called the sun tree  laura theres reasons maybe we need to battle them at the sun tree  taliesin legends say that before the castle was built that the journey into the valley was  treacherous and stormy and the original builders of whitecastle /none/ feared they would die and this  one great tree stood in the valley and it was underneath it that they took shelter and as they  began to take shelter the storm broke and the storm did not return  until the castle was completed  sam thats a lovely story  taliesin we hold our festivals there every year  sam and now its being used as a  taliesin as a gallow yes  laura does it get a lot of sun  matt you do know and this ties into your story as well because the /none/ guidance in forging the city  of whitestone that tree was representative to them as a guardian of pelor the god of the sun  the protector of light holiness  sam who that  taliesin a very serious god  travis that could help  laura that could help us because vampires hate the sun  sam why would they make camp in the place where the god of the sun  laura maybe thats why theyre hanging bodies from it to taint it  liam maybe thats why its protected maybe  sam are any of us religious /none/ with that god or  marisha can we call pike through your magic poo  laura would she be able to hear us  taliesin tablet of apple  sam i can at least see what she is up to  liam keyleth would you be able to revive the tree  laura gasps bring it back  sam what would that do  marisha yeah i can actually  laura i dont know bring up the god of the sun again i dont know  sam were not religious people we cant summon the gods willynilly  liam we /town/ can please pelor  laura dont tell us what we can and cant do scanlan  sam im sorry we can do all of those things yes lets go in the middle of the  vampireinfested town and do some arbory to try to heal the tree and then well just say oh sun  god please rain down sun here  laura i like it lets do it  sam thats a great plan  travis can we at least try cutting down the bodies and running and seeing what happens  sam we could  taliesin i say /town/ in the morning we take a look at the passage see how wellguarded it is and if it  looks dangerous sneak our way into the town if people are not enthralled if they are being  forced to work then maybe we can find some allies  marisha find allies in the town  taliesin i dont think theyre happy  laura i think theyre terrified and i dont want to let them know were here for fear theyll turn  us in in hopes of saving their own necks  marisha thats what im thinking yes theyre terrified /none/ but this whole  towns being ruled by fear  liam i have a feeling we can revive that tree somehow it may weaken the briarwoods hold on the  psyche of the villagers here  laura this is true it could help out let them know the god of the sun is on their side  travis i heard youre supposed to pee on a lemon tree so  laura probably you and scanlan are on that i have a feeling  travis can i make a nature check to see if thats true  taliesin i really wanted /none/ to ask what does peeing on a lemon tree have to do with anything  matt sure  travis 19 thats 17  matt in your experience with the roving band of barbarians you guys enjoyed very much peeing on  very colorful trees of all sorts of plant life all of them generally didnt seem to over time  react well to the process whether it be the fact that you all drank a lot of the time so the  content of your urine was probably not very hospitable  liam its known as a lemon party  /none/ all laugh  matt thats a whole different kind of festival  marisha you killed percy  laura you killed percy  taliesin thank you for bringing the text chat all the way back around  travis operation tree rescue  matt the lemon party is held on the far far southern continent of tubgirl  the region of goatse  travis i have an idea should we wait until the sun comes up create a distraction so all the  undead giants come looking and then we have someone go cut the bodies off the tree and  laura /none/ and bring it back to life  travis  let keyleth give it a little love  marisha and then what happens after that  travis i dont know its an experiment all right  laura then we get the fuck out  sam wont they know were here wont the people see us doing things  marisha i know i feel thats the equivalent of putting dish soap in the fountain on prom night  laura no didnt you say that all around the sun tree nobodys there  marisha yeah we did that what  laura didnt you /none/ say nobodys around the sun tree  sam thats true but we still have to get in  laura well fly up and over you just did the same thing  sam i know i know  laura fly up and over land bring the tree back to life get out  sam are you sure you dont want me to be a carriage driver and youll hide in the hay of my  carriage and ill go straight up to the briarwoods  laura i feel like they know all the townspeople  sam i will put on my /none/ hat of disguise i will be someone completely different  travis they can see through that  liam im telling you they looked right through me  laura when he was invisible  liam invisible they saw me  laura they probably saw you  sam so while he was transparent they saw through him  liam no but i was heavily stealthed  laura no you were invisible  marisha oh wow  matt no the invisibility faded when he attacked the guard  liam when i beaned the guard they should not have been able to see me /none/  sam im not talking about getting past the briarwoods im talking about getting past the  guards that guard their castle  marisha heres another issue its going to take me a minute to do the tree  laura how long  marisha it might take a bit  laura how longs a bit  marisha well i mean its one of those things where the longer i do it the better itll be i  can do it for up to eight hours  travis oh shit  marisha if i do it for up to eight hours /none/ i enrich the land over half a mile radius centered  on a single point and the land becomes enriched for a solid year  laura i dont want to enrich all of the  liam question what time was it when they were doing their little scouting thing theyve just  told us about the sun was going down  matt yeah they probably wouldve gotten to whitestone around seven oclock and leaving right  as the sun had fully set  laura if we go right when the sun goes up  liam yes we get there at /none/ sunrise take those fucking beasts out and you start at eight am  sam but then what  laura we just sneak in heres the thing i dont know if you want to get all the crops all fancy  because itll just feed the briarwoods maybe just do the tree area  which will be like two hours maybe  marisha yeah i think if i have a solid hour or two hours with it  sam once the tree is healed we have no one of religious power to summon any god we dont know  anything about /none/ this god none of us do  taliesin i do in theory if im from  matt go ahead and roll a religion check  taliesin a which  matt a religion check  laura a witch  matt a witch  taliesin 16  matt 16 okay pelor is the god of the sun and agriculture its a good deity and is generally  worshipped by farmers and simple folk and people that live off the land and generally its the  most naturebased deity of the main spectrum outside of melora which is the deity of nature  /town/ marisha oh well dope would i know stuff like that too then  matt you know of pelor yeah there are elements of pelors following that bleeds into your druidic  nature though you dont necessarily follow a deity  marisha right were free  matt you believe that the essence of nature in itself is your patron  marisha totally  matt you are not a religious man by nature and you know that there is a strong following of pelor  in the town the entire graveyard that you talked about earlier that one is largely built around /none/  the imagery of pelor and of all the gods that are worshipped here pelors probably 75 of the  population of whitestone where in some shape or form if not devout worshippers at least were  like yeah pelors cool  marisha heres my question i feel pikes energy tonight maybe while im meditating i can  somehow reach out to her and maybe ask her to get in touch with sarenrae and maybe sarenrae can  call up her homeboy pelor  laura do you think that works  marisha i dont know  travis this is like /town/ phone a friend  marisha were not organized religion people we ashari  liam the tree is called the sun tree its pelors tree im not a cleric of sarenrae but  these shitbags could not have set up camp in a temple of sarenrae because there is too much  goodness there as there was around this tree in this town and its why it is dead its why its  being surrounded by a bunch of giant undead things as you described  you need faith scanlan shorthalt  sam me i am the antithesis of faith  /none/ liam then you need to shut up and let us fix that tree  sam and then what  travis who knows  sam were going to fight off a million monsters to heal a tree and then were going to say  okay bring out the sun or something  marisha hang on what did you just say  taliesin what  marisha that thing you just said that no one heard because we were all shouting and arguing  rally the townsfolk  taliesin rally the townsfolk this is something i think i dont think that sneaking in /none/ is  necessarily the answer im not saying go in guns blazing but i say we let them know  marisha you want to build a militia  taliesin i want to build a rebellion  laura i like it they would recognize you wouldnt they percy  taliesin i have a plan  travis you have a plan  sam does it involve healing the tree  taliesin it does  liam i dont think there is any sneaking in thanks to those birds  so we make a stand out here  travis tell us your plan  /town/ taliesin my plan is we do our best to sneak in we find cover obviously you said theres  abandoned buildings we find cover we heal the tree i have some other ideas we take those  zombie giants out one by one quietly  sam were going to be insurgents  travis shh let him finish the plan  sam i kind of love this  taliesin okay  marisha its like attack on titan thats cool  taliesin lets start finding our friends and we start making friends  we let them know were back  laura i /none/ like it  marisha i like having the people it feels less like were the united states  travis okay where do we start  taliesin i have some parchment i have the thing i want to build while im in the tree its very  simple and i want to show you what it is  matt what is it  taliesin i want to take some gunpowder and basically  sam make a pipe bomb  taliesin basically attach it to a piece of parchment i want to wet it into a piece of  parchment and let /none/ it dry so that when i set fire to that piece of parchment i get a burn scar id  like to create a burn scar  laura gasps  matt yeah thats totally doable  taliesin thank you  matt go ahead and roll a tinkering check just for the sake of a possible epic failure  marisha a burn on yourself  taliesin no itll scar anything it just creates a very high heat  sam like a mark  marisha like a brand  sam like our mark  taliesin like a mark  sam like our /none/ mark  taliesin not our mark  sam the resistance  taliesin the resistance  sam i need a beret  all laugh  taliesin i rolled a 23  matt while the rest of you end up taking your evenings rest grog you immediately snap your  hammock and fall 15 feet to the ground  travis pained groan  matt but you manage to make your way up there and just bear hug the tree trunk for rest youre used  to sleeping in uncomfortable situations  liam i throw five or six pine cones at his head /none/  matt over time or at once  liam at once  travis fucking gravity  matt you manage to complete three pieces of parchment roughly pagesized with your black  powder treatment successfully the mist rolls in and gets thicker and thicker to the point where  you cannot see the floor of the forest the little bit of moonlight that manages to make its way  through the boughs of the trees trickles through and then vanishes into these slowlyshifting bits  of fog your breath every time you exhale is visible as the cold night air begins /none/ to take you  find yourselves instinctively shivering as you cannot grow close to each other for heat nor  build a fire the night while uncomfortable you do manage to get an evenings bit of  mostly uncomfortable rest but rest nonetheless eventually coming to as the morning sun comes up  and heats it up the fog begins to fade away and burn away youre at about an hour past sunrise as  you all unrestfully come to consciousness as the temperature shift hits you manage to relieve  yourselves of your spider silkbased hammocks andor tree grasping /none/ both you and trinket have  found this way of clutching onto the tree trinkets used to the wild  travis this is like sunup right  matt its about seven 730 in the morning  sam can i do a quick scry back to the poo jar that i left back in our kitchen  matt certainly  sam just to make sure that our home base is okay  matt you take a moment and concentrate on the kitchen at this point in time you can see early  morning laina is currently in there yawning and is /none/ cleaning about and starting to make a small  breakfast for all the guards you can hear in the distance some conversation in the distant room  it appears to be a couple of your various employed mercenaries  having a conversation as shes making breakfast  sam so theyre fine  matt they seem fine  sam so i knock that one off and ill try for pike  matt okay concentrating on pike about two minutes of hard concentration  theres no connection  sam they wiped my poo away  matt you gather due to the relatively /none/ fresh and unstable nature of this potion you had concocted  you can only have one source connection up at a time so when you left it in your keep it seems  that the one you had at the temple of sarenrae was alleviated of its magical presence what was once  a magical scry poo is literally just scanscat at the temple  sam which some could argue is magical in its own right  matt sure enough with a high enough persuasion roll  laura teacher teacher  taliesin does it change color when it loses its /none/ power  matt you dont know  taliesin damn it i want to know  sam only one way to find out  taliesin god damn it  matt ask pike when you see her again laughs  taliesin your poo power may come in very handy this is good to know  travis lets go find an abandoned building and set up  liam could we throw in a scanlan grenade and be able to see through it  sam sure  taliesin a scat grenade  liam a scat grenade  sam sure  liam scatlan  marisha /none/ and taliesin scatlan  sam i could get in shit in their bedroom and leave  liam you shit in your hand and you toss it  sam oh yeah that too pull the pin  all laugh  laura yeah remember that thats awesome  travis this is what happens  laura you could fly overhead with keyleth  sam yes  laura drop it like a bomb  sam and then wed have eyes in there  laura i like it  sam i like this a lot give me something to eat  marisha what  sam /none/ i need some fuel  travis holy crap  laura i have a sweet potato right here scanlan  sam sweet potato thats good yes some prunes  marisha yeah something hearty  liam all right were off the rails  travis step one of this  matt so you make your way down into the forest about another hour and a half of travel before you  start getting to where the trees begin to clear up a little bit and you can see the base of the  clearedoff mountain that whitestone castle is built upon and the /none/ pathway that descends into the outer  wall of the city of whitestone  laura how far of a travel is it down into the city  matt its maybe a quarter mile  laura so we can do that a little amount of time  matt spacerelationwise you guys are just getting to this side of the forest right there  right there and this is the mountain  laura so if were going to try stealth this shit in  travis do we take the stealthy one or the invisible one  sam wait  marisha wait wait /town/ which plan are we doing first  travis first part is getting an abandoned building  laura so that we can be near the tree to protect you  sam so that we can be townspeople  marisha okay  sam right  taliesin so you can get a beret  travis abandoned building part one  sam were setting up shop  laura get into the town  travis so who goes and finds the abandoned building  sam percy is known here  taliesin which is why im going to be wearing i havent been seen in years /none/ and when i was seen i  was much younger and honestly  marisha yes but the briarwoods knew who you were  taliesin i had different hair yes they do  marisha the briarwoods recognized you instantly  taliesin they did which was disorienting  sam but theyre not on sentry duty  travis we need a forward operating base so who wants to be stealthy or invisible  and find an empty building  liam question for the assassin path of rogue at 9th level if i have seven days which is way too  much time i /town/ can impersonate anyone i want in half a day could i just be a dirty nobody  matt yeah youd be able to disguise yourself  sam we also have the hat  matt the disguise kit  sam his hat of disguise percy knows this town perhaps percy should wear the hat  travis does it require attunement  sam just a few minutes i think  taliesin i already have the hat  sam yes you had it from the dinner party  taliesin ive been trying to think of what sorts of buildings would be the most /town/ defensible and the  least likely to arouse suspicion things with basements  matt a lot of the houses have basements there are varying degrees of it there are larger  homesteads that were reserved for the actual nobles that ran the daytoday life of whitestone  when your family was in power as you heard from desmond probably the places where the new nobles  live those are the ones that have the gates surrounding them the larger homesteads scattered  throughout the town  taliesin thats too obvious  matt its far too obvious there are many small /town/ abodes and even some farmbased hovels the poor  end of town is the farming side which is the southwest which is the closest area to where you  guys made your stop earlier  taliesin i would almost say a shopping district if theres an abandoned storefront  matt the shopping district is the center of town around the town square  laura around the sun tree  matt yeah right there  taliesin might be too close  sam before we go marching in there finding an abode to live in is not going to be too difficult /town/  well need food  laura are we living in there  sam yes  taliesin were not going to be there for long  travis we have dried food rations  taliesin we have food rations we have options  laura weve got food for days  sam we might be there for days and days  laura weve got food for days  travis weve got dried food rations  sam we also have to go around town and forgive me if im going too far with your plan here but  arent we trying to win allies /none/ among the people  taliesin i have a plan  sam but well need to communicate with them how  laura he has a plan  travis he has a plan  sam sighs all right  travis come on drop your pants and get with the plan  marisha what time is it have we gone to sleep or are we waking up  matt you guys are awake after this discussion id say its about 800 in the morning 830  taliesin lets make our way in  liam this is the time  laura we should stealth /none/ in  marisha are we doing the tree thing right now  matt actually your travel to the city and youre on the outskirts of it now  it would be closer to 930  marisha okay  laura yeah we try to get in  taliesin we find a place to at least set up our operation  marisha well thats what i was going to say do we want to find operations try and recoup  liam we dont really know what were going to find this morning those big guys could still be  there we dont /none/ know  taliesin we dont  liam we dont know if there are people in the pocket of the briarwoods here  travis its like 12 of a plan  marisha if we take a day to get in and get settled i can do a heroes feast and then i start  crack of dawn in the morning  liam i think thats a good idea  taliesin lets get in and set up  liam hole up lets find a place  marisha all right  sam wait were just going to walk into the city  taliesin /none/ no were going to stealth into the city  sam okay  laura were going to cast pass without a trace on everybody  matt okay  sam beard check  travis that was an eight  matt stealth  travis beard check  matt oh laughs your beard is pretty much at the fullest itll ever be you gather you can  probably get a little more thickness to it but your beard is at maximum grog the fact that you  even have a goliath with a beard is a feat of magic in its own right  /town/ travis amazing  liam you would be a freak  travis is it like that vidal sassoon commercial whip it  marisha thats dope  taliesin isnt that dope  sam grog ive heard that no one in this town wears a beard  laura oh natural 20 on stealth  travis you can forget it i wont go in  matt so you guys are traveling as a group i need stealth checks from everybody  taliesin do we have pass without a trace  laura yeah  marisha can we each take a little bit of time to /none/ look more like commoners  taliesin im wearing my hat too  travis look like commoners  sam i rub dirt all over my face  travis shit im a goliath  laura plus we have a bear  sam you should try to look less handsome  marisha yeah we do look like quite the motley crew  liam im wearing a natural 20  sam okay  matt did you roll a natural 20 as well  liam i did  matt both of you guys rolled natural 20s in stealth  liam had a little help with /none/ luck but i got it  matt there you go  taliesin thats really good because i rolled a one  laura oh no  sam weve got pass without a trace so 28  taliesin 11  marisha still a failure  travis are we all going together are we not sending one person in  to go find an empty building  sam were all going together  matt you guys are all going together you dirty yourselves up a bit youre still a large goliath  youre still a few halfelves a gnome  laura theres still /none/ a bear  matt outside of illusion magic youre still going to stick out like a sore thumb  laura could we cast illusion magic do we have it  sam whats illusion magic  liam im walking 50 feet in front of everybody else  laura seeming to make grog and trinket look like commoners  liam im 50 feet in front of everyone else  laura yeah do that  marisha oh yeah seeming us  sam sure all right i will cast seeming on us  matt this is a legit use of seeming too okay  /tavern/ sam well all look like dirty  marisha as opposed to the cows come on  sam  dirty ragged peasants  matt trinket as well  laura yes  taliesin trinket looks like a donkey  laura no hell just be a really drunk peasant  marisha a donkey a mule  sam can i just say this can we just leave trinket behind  laura no  sam i dont want to walk in there with a bear  laura hell look like a fucking donkey or hell look like another commoner  sam i think i can /town/ only make us all look the same  laura then hell look like a fucking commoner  matt of similar size i believe as far as seeming is concerned if not then ill allow it  for the purposes of this  laura hell look like a commoner  marisha a clydesdale  laura  a weird commoner  travis leave the bear  taliesin a milk cow  laura im not leaving a fucking bear on the outside of town where theres hounds around and  theres fucking vampires and birds flying around fuck you  sam oh wait /none/ no you can give each target a new appearance  matt yep  sam so i can make everyone look a little different  matt each creature can seem a foot shorter or taller or appear thin fat or in between  marisha make him look like a milk cow  matt you cant change their body type so trinket will still be a fourlegged creature but  you can make him look like a different fourlegged creature  laura there you go  sam okay hes a milk cow  liam real talk real talk scanlan my sister will /none/ cut you  travis or do you want him to be a donkey something we can move  milk cows are slow  liam bring the bear  taliesin donkeys can move more quickly this is true  sam all right donkey  laura all right  sam hes an ass  matt all right so trinket takes on the form of a donkey  laura laughs so are you darling so are you  travis just like her owner  matt the rest of you are a smattering of various humanoids you  laura fake coughing  sam i /none/ make myself look like a weird hunchback sort of not all there  matt okay so you guys look like pretty rough peasants dirty faces you know hair a  little razzled it looks like youve been living the harsh life on the outskirts of the slums of  whitestone for quite some time  travis i wanted to be a model  matt  with a donkey  taliesin goat bleat  matt so you guys utilizing your stealth checks and the seeming you make your way up to the  which side of whitestone are you coming in /town/ from  taliesin thank you for the double 20  matt percy  laura where are we coming up  taliesin coming in from the west  matt okay so you come into this entrance here you make your way into the center of town  blending in best you can there are a few folks who see you enter just give you a strange look  you all are unfamiliar to the denizens of whitestone  travis oh shit  matt  but you dont look like a threat per se so you are noticed and some people seem /town/ to just  stop and watch you pass but no one seems to make any active mention note  or change in behavior towards it  travis are we checking buildings while were walking through  laura i have passive perception of 21 im always looking  liam i walk over to just one random person on the street and say anyone hiring hands on farms  laura our farm burned down  matt laughs make a deception roll ill give you advantage on it because the seeming does give  you the visual perspective of being close to their /none/ type  liam that is a four no hold on  laura no no no  liam im gonna use luck thats the luck  travis was the first number gonna be a 40  liam no its not 40 so its 14  matt okay thats two luck rolls by the way that youve spent  liam yeah i know  matt the woman you approach whos probably in her early 30s pale blonde hair looks like she  actually might be losing it in some places gives you a look and goes  you poor people shouldnt be /none/ here  liam we just need some work  matt youll find it but youre not going anywhere else welcome to whitestone she turns  around and walks back joining arms with apparently a man that shes paired with and the  two of them just walk away a bit dumbfounded that people walked into whitestone as this happens  you glance over your shoulder and you see coming from the northern edge from this side wall  sounds of booming footsteps  laura oh we should avoid that shit  matt a very tall noticeably undead giant with its /none/ jaw broken off and hanging from the hinge  dried caked blood across its chest its just dragging this large club behind it  liam where are we what are our surroundings right now  matt you right now youre in a t to the right and left are roads that go along the inside of the  wall that surrounds whitestone to the front of you is the path that leads further into the city  laura lets go into the city  travis we casually begin  taliesin i wanna head through the city possibly in the direction /town/ of the cemetery  matt cemeterys over here  taliesin yeah i wanna head in that direction  matt all right so you guys make your way through  laura keeping an eye out for you know buildings that look clustered  and abandoned that we can hide in  taliesin whats changed  matt what youve noticed has changed is one largely the population is far more sparse than  you recall what was once a bustling city youre now seeing about half as many people as you would  would see this time of day going through everyone /town/ seems to be in relatively poor health  there are a few buildings that look longterm abandoned immediately in this area here in the  outskirts catches your guys eye you do notice that the corner lamps that you had set up at the  different corners of the streets appear to be shattered  travis interesting  matt there would be like you know glass oil lanterns that at night someone would go around and  light them after the sunset the posts that hold them now are all either broken or the glass  itself has been shattered /dung/  marisha they want it to be really dark  taliesin they want it to be really dark im also thinking about that cemetery  sam were not gonna live in a cemetery thats super creepy  marisha as opposed to all of the other things weve done  taliesin everything here is super creepy  laura is there any other abandoned buildings around  marisha as opposed to sleeping in the underdark  matt there are plenty of buildings that look dark and mostly untouched in this section here as you  begin to move closer and closer inward /town/  taliesin lets get east of the center square and set up camp  laura okay wheres the castle is it on the top of the  travis its north  laura oh its that thingy okay  sam were trying to shoot for here  matt okay you guys move this way as you push towards the center of this here you  sam you speak giant grog  travis yeah  matt you move past the center here and to the left of you you can see the town square and there  it is the sun tree /none/ very very large you imagine beautiful tree at one time full height was  probably about 40 feet tall the branches twist out and almost look like theyre hanging loosely  the ends everything looks droopy and desolate theres not a leaf on it  marisha can i do some sort of a check from a distance to see if i can recognize  what kind of tree it is  matt make a nature check  marisha 18  matt okay its hard to tell from this distance there are a number of types of trees it could be /none/  its not indigenous to this land the fact that it grew here means that either it was transplanted  or it was some sort of  marisha magical grower  laura sings divine intervention  matt  magical creation for its presence  marisha okay  matt and you do see the silhouette of the eight figures slowly swaying from beneath the branches  travis we continue on dont pay too much attention to it find a place to post up  marisha right dont get emotional  laura if you if you do your naturey spell from inside /none/ a building does it still do the same thing  or do you have to be next to the tree while youre doing it  travis thats a large radius right  marisha so the way the spell works i can do it one of two ways i can do it instantaneously  essentially grow up a whole bunch of plants and brush and shrubbery around me or i can wait and i  can concentrate for a while and instill a plant with vibrant  laura okay  marisha  life energy and heal the farmlands and it would /none/ stretch out for a really far radius  laura lets keep moving  marisha im gonna probably wanna do more the second one  laura okay  travis do it from inside a house  matt did you guys want keep moving down this path to go through the square closer to the  tree do you want to go southward  marisha i dont know its a central point  laura we avoid the tree a little bit and just keep going straight  matt okay so youre going this way  laura yeah  liam theres a larger /town/ building isnt there i cant see  taliesin actually i would say lets get a good look at the tree lets walk by it  sam oh were gonna walk by the tree  marisha look like its no big deal  travis i know  matt you guys turn left and you make your way towards the town square and as you enter the  square looking around you can see there are what would have been carts and small booths set up for  selling of meats and other goods what was a small you know barterandsale based /town/ hub of this  town nowhere near on the scale of emons bazaar but you know enough to support this town  desolate all look to be closed down and untouched for quite some time as you get a closer look to  the actually im gonna have you guys all roll perception checks  youre not getting too close to the tree  travis five  sam nine  liam 26  laura 19 no thats a yeah 19  marisha 14  taliesin 23  matt as you guys are keeping on the outskirts of the square its /none/ hard to make out the details and  the weathering has muddled the figures that are hanging there percy and vax you guys notice the  figure on the far left  liam the body  matt the body on the far left has red paint smattered across its face and its arms its  wearing a dirtied green vestlike robe that dangles below it as it hangs there loosely  immediately to the left of it you see what looks to be the body of a child the child is dressed up  in a purplish billowing shirt very /dung/ fine silk shirt and pantaloons and is dangling there next  to it to the left of that you see what appears to be a female adorned in greens and browns looks like  red paint has been driven through the hair and dangles to the left of that figure next to that  you see what appears to be  taliesin i am walking the fuck away  matt  you see what appears to be another woman dressed in dark blacks and browns leathers some  furs across the top dark hair dangling to the left of that /dung/ you see another man dressed  similarly dark greys and blacks long dark hair dangling to the left of that you see a rather  large man older rotund probably in his forties clothing padded but mostly open chest hair  completely shaven bald it looks like there are dark scars placed across the face hanging to the  left of that you see this figure is actually not humanoid you see what appears to have been  marisha oh my god  matt  a recently hunted bear who is dangling  marisha no no no no no no /none/ no no  sam wait what is that us  marisha it looks like us  travis what  marisha its us  sam they killed people they thought were us or they killed  liam or its a message  sam or its a message to us  marisha do they look like us or were they just dressed like us are they made to look like us  matt do you want to get closer and look  marisha yeah  taliesin im a little curious  travis do you want to get closer and look are you /none/ sure  taliesin is there anything around the tree other than us  travis theyre probably watching the tree  taliesin is there something at the base of the tree is there anything  matt from what you can see now nothing but just rocks and stones and piles of loose cloth rotting  below it approaching it looks like each one of these bodies has been dressed up it looks like  the color in the redheads hair has been smeared through with paint it looks like the person who  has been painted red has been slapdash you /town/ gather with a moment of looking at it that these were not  individuals that were caught this way this was set up as a message  laura whispers my god  sam oh shit  laura keep walking keep your head down and keep walking  marisha oh my god  travis i dont think theyre here  marisha oh my god  travis i dont think theyre here  sam you mean in town of course they are  travis no remember they have to like be where the soil they came from is  laura no they /town/ have like hideouts they dont have to be where the soil they came from is  travis i dont think theyre here  sam holy shit  liam theyre in their keep buried deep  travis okay  matt you guys continue past down this pathway theres other buildings you see in the vicinity  that you know look abandoned or for the most part unoccupied id say about one in every three  buildings looks like its in disuse  liam did we see this big building right here as we walked by yeah that big one  matt /town/ you guys came made this path you can see a little bit you can see is a  taliesin i should know what it is anyway  matt  iron fence it used to belong to one of the noble families of whitestone each one of  these large buildings here these three and you remember this were  the three families that ran the town  taliesin we cant go anywhere near those buildings  we have to stay as far away as humanly possible  marisha question you said there were eight bodies  matt eight bodies  /none/ marisha is there one that looks like a gnome cleric and  one that looks like a dragonborn sorcerer  laura that was the first one  matt and travis the ones painted all red  laura there wasnt a gnome cleric one there  matt no there was a bear  liam there was no cleric when we faced them before all of us who stood against them in emon  travis were all there  sam body of my guy is he sort of handsome  marisha but it does mean that it was because of when they /none/ saw us in emon  matt think of an eightyearold child  laura it was a kid yo  sam oh it was a child oh god  marisha  because tiberius wasnt here with the crows  travis no it was because of emon  marisha it was because of emon  laura yeah  marisha so can we get like a vague idea of how long these people  look like they might have been here  matt make an investigation check  marisha whispers fuck im not good at this shit  taliesin can i help  /none/ matt sure it would be advantage on that check for you  marisha oh that you know that wasnt bad woo  taliesin oh never mind  marisha ill take that 19 21  matt 21 you gather these bodies have probably been here for the better part of a week week and  a half there is some mild decomposition starting to settle in there is a bit of bloating to some  of them couldnt have been much longer than that  sam a week thats before we set out  marisha why would they put a warning /none/ for us here in the city  sam they assumed we would come but they dont know that were here  taliesin they invited us  liam those birds might have told them we were here  sam this was a week ago this was before we were even close  travis lets stick with the plan  taliesin sticking with the plan  sam lets go find a building  taliesin going to go find something thats a decent distance away from the three noble  households that has a reasonable view of the tree  travis yeah 150 /none/ feet from the tree  matt that would probably be somewhere in this vicinity here  as the three main houses are right there  taliesin something with a secondfloor view but with some distance  travis preferably three bedroom three bath  matt laughs id say make an investigation check  taliesin meh six  laura can i look out too ive been on the lookout for a building the whole time  matt yeah ill say ill say it takes the better part of the next hour or so and you do a little  bit of meandering /none/ to find it you guys are being stealthy best you can through alleys and such but  even so you are out in the open midday but you are also you know under seeming  marisha does it look like theres a covering nearby roughly 30 feet or so from the tree  laura 30 feet  sam 30 feet  matt no  sam what about 150  matt no the tree is out in the center and essentially the nearest building is probably  anywhere from 100 200 feet away from it its the tree out in the /tavern/ middle of the square and the  square which used to have probably more things towards the center more temporary establishments  have all been put to the sides and put to disuse  sam maybe underground stuff  matt you do manage to see what appear to be what was once a tavern or an inn of some kind that is  silent closed the doors locked and chained the windows look dusty  laura can we sneak in the windows so it keeps chained  matt okay you go around the side of it to the alley  /none/ taliesin dust of tracelessness  laura yeah dust of tracelessness  sam are you guys going in  liam yeah  taliesin yeah  laura yeah  taliesin this is where were going to hole up  matt okay  marisha i kind of want to talk to the tree  laura then go talk to the tree keyleth  matt the window is locked  sam wait not now not now  travis no no no no no not yet  sam lets find a place first  travis lets post up first  liam what am i stealthing /none/ right now or checking for  matt continuing your guys stealth as your going this would be  your attempting to unlock the window  liam oh unlock okay so thats a 22  matt 22 okay it takes a bit to jostle it in a way because the lock is on the inside but there  are ways that you could shimmy the glass and get something underneath to push it aside you manage  to get the window open and as you pull it up the dust billows up around you you set it aside you  step /dung/ in and the place smells stale musty dark there are you can see candlesticks set around  that have not been lit for a while and the oil lanterns that normally light the interior of the  main tavern social area have been long in disuse  laura is there a cellar here  matt if you guys want to look around are you all going in  taliesin yeah were all going in  travis yeah were all going in  matt you as well or are you talking to the tree  sam yes  travis come inside /none/  marisha does anyone want to come talk to a tree with me  taliesin not yet  laura not yet not just yet  travis dont bring that dont mess with that thing  liam yeah come with us keyleth come with us  marisha all right all right  travis once we do it its like ringing a dinner bell  marisha all right all right all right im coming im coming  sam im gonna look for a brothel  all laugh  taliesin thats going to be the saddest brothel  marisha the saddest brothel  /tavern/ matt you find your way inside the abandoned tavern and it is what was this giant lshaped  building right here in the corner of the town square there is a second floor approximately  runs 20 rooms they are all currently unlocked some of them left open the bedding covered in  dust some of it looks like it was left in a hurry  travis yeah well take it  matt there is a cellar  laura yeah  matt you find the cellar and down there there are a number of empty barrels and a couple of /none/  ones that are still full  sam ooh  matt one that appears to be a heavy whiskey barrel probably about twenty untouched wine  bottles a little bit of ale but it looks like a lot of ale was either completely used or taken  with whoever left and abandoned the premises  laura i think we can definitely use these for explosions if we need them  marisha ooh  sam or to drink  taliesin muscle relaxers is there a view of the tree  matt going from a number of the rooms up top not /none/ every room has a window but its like every third  room on that side of the building does have a view of the entire square  marisha can i get an eye as to how far away it is  matt id say probably about 200 feet 250 feet  laura can you go invisible and still talk to the tree  marisha hmm  sam i can make her invisible if she can talk to the tree  laura can you talk to the tree if youre invisible  matt if you cast a spell while invisible unless /tavern/ its greater invisibility  then it will drop the illusion  sam i can make her invisible  marisha i got an idea  sam we can burrow under we can  laura yeah  sam  find something closer  marisha actually what are we up to right now are we doing anything are we busy  sam well there are windows on the first floor right  matt there are some windows in the tavern there was one on the second floor  laura were in the cellar thats why i went to the cellar  marisha oh /none/ theres a cellar  sam im gonna just find some old rags or anything i can find tablecloths  and just cover the windows  laura but make it not obvious because it doesnt want to look like we covered the windows  sam true  liam ive watched you pass through solid stone and earth how long can you do that for  marisha i mean i can burrow us a tunnel right now  laura do it  liam can you get us close to underneath the tree  laura thats what shes going to do  marisha /none/ im going to do it right now im going to cast move earth  laura from the cellar  matt youre going to start carving a tunnel  marisha to the direction of the tree and i want to be careful i dont want to damage the roots of  the tree at all so as i start getting closer i want to start looking for the roots of the tree  matt okay easy enough to find old rags all of them have that stale musty towel scent to them  you get them a little wet theres no /none/ water here all the water here has dried out  sam we use the wine  matt youll have to use the wine itll probably kill some of the bacteria there are wells  throughout the towns you see ground wells that are set in the city there is no nearby river the  closest river the one you know about is about a 30 minute walk south  taliesin its a bit of a ways  matt yeah you use that to coax them out a bit its easy enough for you to go around and put  cloth /dung/ over the windows its a dark interior so its not like an immediate  taliesin just so light doesnt leak out  liam but just in case i think ill hang back im not going down to the premade tunnel ill  just keep an eye above ground  travis i am too im staying up in the tavern  laura im going with you to the tunnel  taliesin im going to tinker a little thing can i borrow an arrow  laura yes  taliesin thank you im going to tinker a very little easy thing  travis /none/ you want the top floor ill take the bottom floor  taliesin i want to be able to fire and ignite one of the parchments on an arrow so that i can  laura do you want me to shoot the arrow for you  taliesin  set a burn mark at a distance  matt interesting okay  taliesin it would be a spark as opposed to actual flame it would just be concussive force  matt right its more getting the parchment there without it tearing or the arrow leaving it behind  because it is a thin /none/ flimsy piece  taliesin it would be coiled  matt coiled and then  taliesin hit release  matt thats going to be a really intricate go ahead and roll a tinkerers check  liam 20 20 20  taliesin 16  matt okay you toy with it for a while you think you have something that may work youre uncertain  as to on its release if itll function or not so write down parchment delivery arrow with a  question mark next to it  sam maybe theres a simpler way  taliesin there might be but just /none/ in case theres not i want to make sure this works  marisha you could always slap it up there  and shoot it with a flame arrow  taliesin ive got three of them so ive got options but i just want to make sure  marisha hows my burrowing going 200 feet  matt all right you continue to burrow through the ground moving the earth aside and the tunnel  opens before you like the clay slowly melting away and it is wet earth eventually you start  getting to a few thick roots under the tree /none/  laura can you talk to it from here keyleth  matt the roots that you see they continue past the tunnel they go very  very deep into the ground  marisha awesome im going to clear out a little more area and im going to touch the roots and  cast speak with plants  travis holy shit  sam speak with plants  liam haroom haroom  taliesin the only superpower more pathetic than aquamans  laura yeah  marisha shut up  taliesin sorry had to  laura kids voice gee wiz i wish i had /none/ some water  marisha kids voice the sun is so bright today  laura too bad we dont have tiberius with us with his endless water fucking pitcher  liam its ent voice haroom haroom  taliesin hi aquaman  laura sure sure sure  taliesin hi aquaman  sam i can go to one of the wells and get some water  taliesin hi aquaman  marisha hey hes cool sometimes  taliesin hi aquaman  marisha sometimes  taliesin its what fish say hi aquaman  marisha thats what fish say  liam thats all they say  /none/ taliesin hi aquaman  matt you finish the spell and you reach out and you touch the root and you instill the force of  your naturebased divine energies into the root silence  sam oh no  matt this tree is dead  travis no  sam dead  laura you can bring it back  marisha i can bring it back should i  sam you can do that  marisha im a druid thats my yeah man  sam you can bring dead things back  marisha yeah its called plant growth  sam what  marisha /tavern/ yeah  sam this i gotta see  marisha should i okay but its dead what time is it now  matt right now with all the traveling you guys have done id say its past noon probably  including the time youve spent inside the tavern searching it through and preparing it  as your base of operations  laura try it  marisha should i start it up now  sam yeah  liam laura and travis go for it  marisha im going to start my plant growth im going to drop can i try to clear /tavern/ out an area  where i can i should be fine  laura reach up in its junk  taliesin put your hand in it  marisha im going to strap on my gloves  travis okay  liam turn and cough  marisha hope you guys are ready for this  sam is it going to be loud  marisha no its just going to take a long time  travis vax and i are guarding the tavern so if anything comes  sam im going to get provisions ready to spoonfeed her  marisha actually before i do /none/ that can we all have one last meal together  and eat a heroes feast  laura i like it  taliesin yes  matt certainly  taliesin lets eat  matt so youve made the purchase within emon for how many of the  requisite chalice for the heroes feast  marisha how many did i buy  taliesin you have at least one  marisha it gets used its expensive  laura its 1000  marisha its 1000  matt its a gemencrusted bowl worth 1000 gold pieces which the spell consumes so well say  how many /none/ of those did you purchase in emon knowing youd be casting this in the future  marisha how much gold do we have  sam not a lot  laura is that for each person or 1000 gold for the whole party  matt for the whole feast  laura how about you did three bowls  marisha three bowls  matt mark 3000 gold from the groups queue and you have three gem bowls using one now so you  have two bowls left at your disposal and you prepare a heroes feast for the group to consume  /none/ marisha i take some of that leftover wine use that to make it fancy wine  sam this is great this is awesome  laura are we eating in the cellar  marisha so you get i believe 2d12 additional hit points on top of your maximum hit points  sam wait forever  laura no no for how long  marisha for 24 hours  matt it lasts for 24 hours  sam 2d12  matt so until about  sam what the fuck is a d12 ive never rolled a d12  matt  2pm tomorrow so mark /none/ that down somebody note that it lasts until 2pm  laura an additional 2d12  matt 2d10  marisha oh im sorry 2d10  taliesin damn it  laura overall hit points  marisha and you should have ooh i got two tens  laura ah badass  matt trinket can also benefit from this by the way too  laura yay nice  taliesin you also get other bonuses  matt yep you are immune to poison and diseases and being frightened and all wisdom saving throws  are made with advantage feast is awesome  sam why dont /town/ we do that right before we go see the briarwoods also  laura we have another bowl  marisha we have two more bowls  sam because that is fucking awesome  marisha doing that right now just in case the briarwoods decide to come say hello  taliesin or any of the other terrible people who live in this town because there are terrible  people in this town  travis that was a delicious feast  sam the tikka masala was tangy  marisha so were immune to poison  matt and disease and frightened so feast consumed /none/ you now take your next eight
