unless we have any other announcements i think its time to bring us down to tonights  episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back so picking up /none/ where we last left off vox machina our band of  adventurers had been collecting the vestiges of divergence a series of artifacts to prepare for  their coming encounter with thordak the cinder king and the rest of the chroma conclave a group  of evil ancient dragons that banded together to tear across and dominate the taldorei  countryside  during their most recent journey they were tailing a competitive group searching for these  same artifacts led by a forgotten villain of the past known as dr ripley they were led into a  trap and a /none/ heavy battle took place one that claimed the life of percival the party retrieved  his body took it back to whitestone and through a series of very lucky rolls and imploring his  soul to return once freeing it from the devouring jaws of orthax the shadow demon he was restored  to life  celebration was shortlived thus far after an evenings rest they were asked by their old ally  seeker asum to meet them upstairs in castle whitestone in the war room for a very important  meeting upon arriving around the central table asum revealed /none/ himself to actually be raishan the  green dragon and member of the chroma conclave that you had not seen since the original attack on  emon and left you last with the bombshell and bit of information that raishans here to make an  alliance and as you are as well raishan is interested in the destruction and downfall of  thordak the cinder king  and thats where were going to pick up having just revealed through the somewhat transformed  eyebrows eyes and upper face of the hairless tattooed and scarred side head of seeker asum you /none/  can see the reptilian green scales billow out and become glowing yellowish reptilian eyes peeking  through the voice modulates into more of a deeper but thin reedy hiss after asum looks to  you all as raishan and says i wish to kill the cinder king now do you accept my alliance  laura thats it were just supposed to trust you  matt no i assumed youd ask questions im an open book what do you require  liam why in the fuck should we trust you  matt you shouldnt to be perfectly honest i am /none/ a being that rides the line between whats true  and whats false and i know your research has spoken the same however strange circumstances  make for strange bedfellows and circumstances as they are i think you have very little choice as  do i  liam what do you claim your motives to be  matt listen for a moment and ill tell you a bit about the history of this green dragon before you  my home is south of here within the jungles of the rifenmist peninsula along the southern side of  the stormcrest that /none/ is where i met the cinder king nearly two decades ago he encroached upon my  territory we battled then an exhausting struggle over days thordak is keen of eye however and  older than i he held his assault he saw me and he saw my disease  i was cursed a halfcentury ago when i infiltrated and toppled a temple of melora that  was being built by a high druid for her roving peons as i consumed her last follower broke the  druid upon her altar she gave her dying breath to spite me this sickness /none/ that she imparted was  merely an inconvenience but as the years wore on it spread and worsened  i left my pursuits of base interests and began to obsess over a cure for this before it took me i  burned through servant after servant to find anything on such a disease everything failed  everything  thordak somehow noted and recognized my ailment he said you are unwell a rare malady upon you  it will claim you in time however ive traveled the world ive gathered many secrets and i know  how to be rid of /none/ it to burn it out of your system with a fire you will never find ive done  it before i can burn away the worst of illnesses  now i am a creature that can pierce any lie by nature i know in my heart that he spoke the truth  that day that dragon when asked what he wanted in return he said your servitude we made an  agreement he would return once he marked his domain we discussed the terms  however he did not return i grew furious and sought answers only to find that /none/ he was brought  low and sealed away by some assembled others some fools from emon it took me years of seeking but  i found his whereabouts i was not going to let my chance to strike away this bloody curse slip from  me so i met him on the fire plane over the years i saw his swelling his pained form he  spoke of plans ideas for vengeance and domination but he would not relinquish the  secrets he promised me until i released him  i proposed the conclave i assembled the others i negotiated /none/ the agreements i corrupted the  binding stone i prepared the pyrah gate i did everything  as time went on thordaks clarity muddled it seemed his bindings the power that he was  absorbing was beginning to drive him mad so we did not have any more time i needed to initiate  the escape before he lost enough to forget our agreement the means to even fulfill his side of  the bargain no celestial solstice as planned but winters crest would have to do and with thordak  freed the conclave assembled taldorei was razed divided and /none/ won  but thordak still withheld his words he laughs at my requests i see now that he does not mean to  tell me and never really did as his mind began to go he enjoys his seat of power over all of  you over me i want him dead i want to watch him be torn apart i want to see his eyes go cold  and in that very moment i want to call his spirit back and bind his word to tell me how i can save  myself and then laugh at his misfortune /none/ as i tear whats left of him  that is why i come to you i have not the power to take him myself  marisha thordak will experience all of those things he will burn and he will suffer and you  will not be there to watch it happen  laura keyleth  marisha you want to feel the burning inside of you oh you will feel it raishan but it will  not be from thordak or whatever proposed cure he made up the burning you feel will be from the  souls of ten thousand fire /none/ ashari as they sear your flesh and the last thing that you will see will  be my face as i watch you suffer as you watched a quarter of my civilization burn  matt child i commend your bravery in the face of certain doom but think before you give in to  such base passions there is much to be gained by us working together and so much more to be lost  marisha oh you commend me for bravery oh raishan for someone who is supposed to be so  smart i am not afraid i know /none/ what you are you are a parasite you walk around calling yourself a  magnificent ancient dragon you are nothing more than a leech you consumed the energy of my people  for years and were supposed to just trust you  matt child your anger is misplaced  marisha shouting call me child one more goddamn time  travis i move behind keyleth  matt i did not slay a single one of your people thordaks release destroyed the top of that  mountain  marisha shouting which you did you unleashed the mad dog you bitch this is /none/ your fucking  fault quieter hes just a mad king as you said so yourself youre the master planner but your  plan backfired didnt it so now youve come to us and you think that you can formulate some  other master plan thats still going to somehow get you what you want you dumb fool when will  you fucking learn  matt keyleth  marisha raishan  matt do not mistake my grace in this room for need of conflict nor foolhardy wishes if i  wanted each one of you dead i would be chewing on /none/ your bones right now  taliesin i think perhaps if i may be so bold as to tidy up what keyleth is trying to drive home  here is that for all intents and purposes from this side of the table you strike me as a  desperate creature whos pretending that he has a choice to be here and has brought she excuse  me that is another conversation youve brought very little to the table we are not impressed  with your notions that somehow we can work together you need us and this is all you bring /none/  matt i bring information  taliesin scoffs  matt i bring knowledge of thordak  taliesin where is asum  matt i know where asum is  taliesin where is asum  liam lets start with that  taliesin lets stop pretending you have a choice here  matt the one you call seeker asum is alive in emon still working amongst the clasp the story i  gave you was mostly truth peppered with necessary deceit to place me here amongst you for the time i  needed he is there to secure survivors against thordak  i /none/ infiltrated the ranks of the clasp gained his trust which allowed me to find your whereabouts  and so i came he sent me on a mission to notify you of his plans which by the way along with  brotoras goldhand and the clasps cooperation they have a plan to strike at the cinder king  liam insight check well hold on no 13 never mind  matt slippery dragon  laughter  matt theres no reason for you to believe or disbelieve its just words to you right now  liam yeah  laura whats their plan  /none/ matt one thatll fail of course you see they put their knowledge in what a red dragon is  capable of they believe that by quelling the flames or stoking some nature of the crystal in  its bellys magic there would be a way to stop him and there is a path to be taken there yes  but their knowledge is faulty they dont understand the nature of the enchantment and  should they attack they will burn in the flames of their own righteousness  laura whats your illness  matt i wish i knew the extent /none/ of it and you watch as asums form grows a little more green in  places the scales unfolding and as the image though still in the halfling form where the  scales rest you can see a series of deep purplishblack veins that ride up the side of the  throat and across the chest and the arms and they pulse with each heartbeat it withers my  constitution it makes me weary ive sat with this for nearly a hundred years my brain is not  dull but i wish not to have this brilliant intellect waste away /dung/ into ash because i couldnt  find an answer  laura so you come before us and you tell us youre weak  matt well weak by my standards  marisha youre weak by mine too  liam if we were to work with you and that is a massive fucking if if we were to work with you  and thordak were to fall paint us a picture what can we look forward to after that what  happens to you where do you go what happens to taldorei  matt i have no interest in this mass domination /none/ most of these petty creatures that you call your  brethren they live amongst their cities and thats fine my happiness lies in returning to my  home in the rifenmist where i can pillage the eastern and southern coasts or i can ride out  amongst the viridian ocean and steal what is necessary to survive and enjoy my network of  followers and spies far away from where you live  liam you might as well be feeding us nursery rhymes  marisha sounds like a life happily ever after  matt if youre uncomfortable with my proximity /none/ post the fall of the king i will happily take my  presence elsewhere gather my people my belongings and find a roost somewhere across the  ozmit perhaps  taliesin im comfortable with that being a conversation that happens later  laura well obviously but i dont believe anything she says  travis youre sure that thordak has a cure for you  matt i have spent many years trying to untangle what could be the lie behind those eyes and i am  certain there is a confidence with knowing and withholding it is stronger than the strongest /none/ of  bluffs and ive seen that confidence in the cinder king a cruelty in that knowledge that  smugness  laura is he still insane  matt by most standards has been for some time but it continues to slip his narcissism grows to  dangerous bounds  travis what about the white dragon  taliesin before we would consider any terms we would need the white dragon removed from the  playing field  marisha could be a good way for you to show us your loyalty even though you have none but know  raishan whatever deal /none/ we strike does not end in you leaving my sight youre going to die youre  going to die even if i have to die doing it  matt amusing  taliesin really this is a conversation about whether or not we wait to try and kill you until  before or after the cinder king thats fair i think  matt you think that because you took surprise upon umbrasyl the brute his inferior intellect  that you will have the opportunity to strike me down you have no idea what im capable of no  matter what malady /none/ festers within me  taliesin oh we know  matt this is your home right percival  taliesin it is  matt it would be a shame for it to suddenly no longer exist  marisha can we please just fucking kill her now  taliesin im not keyleth your threats they wont bend me because i believe you i believe  that you would rend this entire city asunder thats why im at the table i am conscious of  where we are im conscious of who you are and im conscious of what you need im just trying /none/ to  make sure that everybodys clear that the minute that red dragon dies all bets are off you know  it as well as i do and you should be wary because only one side of this table is  underestimating the other  travis which side is it  taliesin thank you grog  sam can i do a perception check to make sure that this being is actually in the room and is not just  some sort of phantom  laura weve seen this before  sam 17 oh wait am i proficient no 19  /none/ matt 19 okay the entity you see before you does appear to be physically present to the best of  your knowledge no ones touched it or attempted to but it does seem to be present with you  travis all right i love a good story so do you have a plan  taliesin one step at a time white dragon  matt vorugal is a beast simple of mind eager to kill eat sleep thats about the extent as  long as its given enough land and cattle to devour it seems happy it enjoys the hunt it /none/  enjoys the challenge  taliesin how willing do you feel to be a participant in his demise  liam a lot better if youd be willing to shed a bit of blood  taliesin get your hands dirty  marisha oh shes already done that  matt our agreement should this go forward does not end when the cinder king dies i demand the  opportunity to converse with the spirit from the corpse  once thats done then you may pull your rug out from under me if you will i wish you the best of luck  /none/ taliesin well i assume once hes dead either youll turn on us or youll run away either way  works for me  liam yeah were getting a bit ahead of ourselves are you going to scrap with the white  dragon with us or not  laura can you talk him into flying off leaving everyone alone  taliesin no i want a dead dragon  matt you see whereas i have the aptitude to know where my alliances stand vorugal is of the  entire conclave the closest thordak has to a lap dog  laura so dead /none/ then  matt probably the best bet yes  taliesin yes grog  travis i have a question do you want to talk to thordaks dead spirit or are you after the big  shiny jewel in the middle of his chest  matt i have no interest in whatever enchantment shackles him to his insanity i merely wish to  draw from him the secret ive been promised  travis insight check to see if hes lying  laura ditto  matt insight check both of you guys go  laura oh that was terrible  travis 18  /none/ laura ugh 13  matt seems to be telling the truth  travis yeah sure  laura well yeah sure she does  travis hes telling the truth  laura she  travis shes telling the truth  taliesin once the white dragons off the board then we will hammer out whatever promises can be  made but until then theres just many players on the field to say one way or another  laura have you been here as asum this whole time what have you been doing  matt gathering information like i do  laura what do /none/ you do sleep in his room like a halfling  travis yeah do you wear his clothes and use his soap and brush with his toothbrush  matt no i moved down to the stables and found a soft bit of hay yes i sleep in his bed and his clothes  travis thats a lot of attitude to what i feel is a simple question its gross  marisha its pretty gross  taliesin it must be so humiliating for you that you need to turn to us for help you do have my  pity in that regard /none/  matt it isnt the most optimal circumstance but i think we both have much to gain  marisha why do you think thordak is the only one with knowledge of a cure  matt because everywhere ive sought the information seems to have been destroyed by  thordak once we made the accord  laura if you tell us what the disease is  marisha because that puny little druid that cursed you well dont forget youre dealing  with a puny little druid right here  matt you could take a look if you like but i myself /none/ do not know its nature  laura have you tried greater restoration  laughter  marisha that seems to be the solution to all of our problems  taliesin its the chicken soup of dungeons and dragons  marisha chicken soup for the dnd soul  liam its feed a curse starve permadeath  travis please go ahead  matt yes i have  marisha what was the question  matt ive tried all forms of cleansing magic ive bent many diviners to my aid and all have  failed this isnt a simple magic this was a spirit curse /none/ this was something far more  powerful  travis sounds like a job for me spits come on  taliesin you dont have to  matt i dont want to  travis spit smells funny you know  taliesin is it two days until the white dragon  laura how long do we have  travis wait will thordak know if we do something to vorugal  taliesin of course  matt its likely very quickly yes  travis why  matt keeps a close watch on his subjects hes paranoid requires us to continuously  check in which i /none/ have been  laura youve been checking in from where here  matt i have my means in my room yes  laura does he know where you are  matt no as far as he knows im currently somewhere on the outskirts of westruun attempting  to forge some sort of vengeance for what happened to umbrasyl  taliesin if he did find out he was here it would be very easy to turn the two of them against each  other  laura so when vorugal flew over did he not sense you  matt im very good /none/ at avoiding the sight of those who would seek me if i wish not to be seen  laura was he seeking you or was he seeking whitestone  matt based on the correspondence that was put out by thordak he was very perturbed at the death  of the black dragon that youve slain as such sent a rather large assortment of his and  vorugals wyvern army to sweep the entire middle eastern side of taldorei in search of you i  presume  thankfully your allies put up some sort of illusory barrier which i did not /none/ disturb during  that time to whatever consolation that is to our agreement  taliesin it is of great consolation in fact i would go so far as to say that i am willing to say  that these talks will continue post the destruction of the white dragon so long as these  talks take place in whitestone  laura we wont have much time to talk after the destruction of the white dragon  taliesin well have enough and if there is no whitestone to hold talks in there will be no talks  matt this is true /none/  sam one moment game this out for me friends if this is all bullshit and thordak has sent this  little lady here to trick us into traveling with her to draconia where thordak is lying in wait to  kill us the second we get there well then if were making a deal for this little lady to kill  on our behalf why do we need to go can we just stay in whitestone and you go kill the white  dragon for us youre powerful arent you why do you need us  matt you see /none/ if i were to utilize my full potential which would be required to fell  vorugal as idiotic as the creature is its still a very dangerous and cunning foe  liam not for you youre so clever  sam yeah you can pretend to be vorugals something pet hamster for a while until you  kill him in his sleep  matt maybe i overestimated your intelligence but in doing so would immediately paint a target  on my back for thordak i think its best that i remain in his good graces as we all flank up  /none/ unexpectedly when the time is right  taliesin he is correct  matt she  taliesin im really enjoying that  travis i would also say that if she wanted to set a trap with three dragons on us they would all be  here right now  taliesin also they couldve avoided it entirely and waited for us to go to draconia as opposed to  having someone come by to remind us that we were going to draconia in the first place it seems  like an awful lot of work  marisha i still dont really know /none/ why we need her to begin with were powerful enough why dont we  just kill her now  taliesin honestly because it would damage the castle  travis no dont provoke  sam what is that move dont do that  marisha are you inviting  matt im saying the choice is yours either we work together or you all fall  travis come on even my simple mind sees the advantages here  liam keyleth all were debating is the order in which they die  marisha she was first on my list  taliesin i dont recommend /none/ lists the only reason im stopping you from doing this and i swear  this is the truth is because this is my home  marisha but this could be our best chance  taliesin there would be nothing left  marisha could be the easiest  matt halfelf look at me your worldview is clouded by optimism that does not belong in  exandria there is good there is evil but this world has been remade many times because life is  destruction you should know this as a purveyor of life in its own right the cycle lives /none/ on the  chaos perseveres everything grows eats then dies or is eaten you can put whatever fine  dressing on it you like  liam yeah shut the fuck up sick bag  marisha shes not making this easy to walk away you guys  liam percy is right we dont want the people of whitestone to fall like the people of  the ashari  laura more deaths do not make it right keyleth  travis youre going to get yours youre going to get it  matt are you telling me you have not claimed a life /dung/ or two in your time do you think your goals  and your attempts to save those close to you have not been wrought with bloodshed  marisha oh i know the consequences of every step of my actions it is you raishan who did not  realize the biggest consequence is standing in front of you right now  matt do you think you have not stepped on an anthill to get to your destination  marisha i dont give a flying shit  matt i merely stepped on an anthill to get to mine  liam youre just /dung/ fucking winding her up man  matt understand there are different levels of thought intellect and intent here i come to you  because we have much to gain together or lose everything by not listening to what i have to say  taliesin you will join us in the fight against the white dragon  matt i will if you promise to let thordaks soul be mine  taliesin nope thats not the deal  liam were talking about a second round of negotiations  taliesin we will consider your offer once the white dragon is dead not a /none/ minute before  matt this isnt a negotiation  taliesin this is everything of a negotiation you fool  matt what am i getting out of this  taliesin your life  sam an opportunity to prove yourself to us  taliesin a cure to yourself  laura a chance to take down thordak you said yourself you cant do it on your own  liam we havent danced with a dragon that now stands breathing  taliesin your desperation is so obvious  marisha we walk away and you die or we stay whispering and you die  matt /none/ if i aid you with the tearing of vorugal as a show of goodwill in response you keep my true  nature secret between those in this room  travis oh yeah  matt you maintain that i have access to the length and breadth of whitestone  travis wait a minute why the length and bread of whitestone  matt largely because i have interests in deciding my plan against thordak lets just say  some of it may include a trinket or two that have come in your way on your travels  travis are you fully aware /none/ of what lies beneath whitestone  matt i have some ideas  taliesin would you like to see it  matt i have seen it already  taliesin have you  laura youve been down there  matt ive been here for some time my dear  laura then why didnt we meet down there why are you so scared of it  travis yeah if youve seen it tell us what it is  marisha i know you know  taliesin of course he  sam you say it first  matt im not telling you anything that was /none/ not part of the negotiation  travis how big is it if youve seen it  laughter  sam describe it  taliesin one dead white dragon and then  marisha oh jeez what is that  matt raishan snaps her fingers you see a spark and you notice a brief burst akin to a minor  illusion no sound nothing just the image of a tiny black orb  travis shit shes seen it  taliesin one dead white dragon and then the negotiations continue we will speak to no one of  what you truly are although we /none/ may caution others that were looking a bit sideways at seeker asum  matt i would recommend none of that any suspicion means im being followed if im  followed and feeling threatened the person you told may not survive we do not want that but im  going to look out for myself so anyone you tell youre putting in danger  taliesin thats also fair  marisha anyone you touch youre then putting yourself in danger if any of our friends wind up  dead were looking at you first  matt fair enough  laura have you /none/ done anything with the rest of our friends  marisha wheres asum did we already cover that  laura yeah we already covered that  marisha i was very angry i couldnt hear a whole lot  taliesin whitestone will not fall if whitestone falls all deals are off if whitestone is  attacked all deals are off you keep it off the radar  matt its already off the radar i just will not touch the radar  taliesin thatll do  liam what is radar  matt i dont know  taliesin do you never go into my /none/ room do you never look at what im working on  sam what room are we in right now  matt this is the old war room which is upstairs facing the front  laura the old war room because we moved the new one down into the ziggurat and she didnt respect that  matt nope  marisha whispers bitch  liam i said singing bitch  sam how big is the room  matt its about id say close to 30 feet by 60 feet  sam how many entrances  matt theres two doors that enter and /none/ then two windows that face out the front  laura are you going to attack her all of a sudden are you going to attack her right now  sam we should probably kill her right now  marisha i agree with that can i do a scan of the room like a perception check to see if i notice  magical traps or anything weird set up  matt make an investigation check  marisha investigation  matt if youre looking for traps its investigation  marisha no is there anything off does it look like theres an opening /none/  matt make a general perception check  travis we can kill her whenever might as well use her  marisha general perception 21  matt 21 glancing about the room it does not appear to have anything that you notice different  it has the two banners on the side walls it has the table in the center with some chairs scattered  about and theres the two windows opposite one window that currently raishan has to her back  liam i dont think scanlan is wrong i think he is weak  laura why  sam it  /none/ liam however she will try to destroy as much as possible out of spite in her death throes  taliesin thus also exposing the city we will be attacked that will be the end of whitestone  travis i walk up very gingerly to keyleth and i grab one of her antlers very gently and i say  look if you want to go were with you but if you exercise a little patience i think well get  more out of this and youll still get yours in the end  marisha is grog talking to me about patience /none/ right now  laura thats very important  marisha thats so extreme  travis dont get me wrong i want to crack it open right now but well get more later  liam hes learned a lot  marisha grog  taliesin i guarantee you the complete lack of satisfaction that you feel when shes finally dead  will be just as potent two days from now  marisha did thordak tell you about the trinkets of ours that you wanted  matt thordak has no idea what lies beneath this city thordak is too obsessed with himself  marisha /none/ about what we have i mean  matt are you referring to your vestiges  marisha she knows  matt you already told me everything you informed me of your entire journey  laura i know okay because were really smart and we totally  sam we knew it was you all along we want you to know what youre up against  laura thats right  matt of course you did  liam taunting you all along  marisha we thought she was asum we talked and she knows she knows we told her everything what  does he /none/ want  matt what does thordak want thordak wants everything everything thordak is using the  crystal in his belly to slowly build a volcano beneath emon to turn the surrounding city and the  countryside into a new mountain of his visage  laura how long until that happens  matt thats going to be another hundred years before the entire mountain is complete but the  physicality is already adjusting the molten rock begins to swirl and flow beneath the cloudtop  district  travis wait you said hes building a volcano  matt well the volcano is /none/ being summoned beneath him such is the nature of the crystal he carries  the energy he absorbed from the fire elemental plane carried over with him and its still  hungry its why he swells thats why hes in pain but he just laughs amidst it as it also  gives him extreme power and nigh invulnerability  travis and you said you knew thordak before he was trapped in the elemental plane was he in any  way on what is now known as glintshore before the elemental plane  matt its possible i have no knowledge of /none/ this glintshore  liam what do you know about the briarwoods  matt i dont think i know anything about some briarwoods  liam really what do you think about the wall surrounding that beach ball down there its a  little creepy down there isnt it  matt its a little offputting yes  liam you expect us to believe you know nothing as smart as you are you know nothing of what  happened there in the months past  matt i know what ive been told  liam are you sure youre not trying to summon something /none/ awful out of that marble  matt do you think i wish to have another creature that i pay subservience to  laura no  travis maybe if he can heal you  laura is melora an enemy of vecna do we know that  matt essentially melora is the goddess of the wilderness and the sea very nature life  elementalbased deity vecna is not a god vecna was very powerful wanted to become a god and was  balked and scattered supposedly destroyed a long time ago but the cults still endure and infiltrate  and wander various /none/ parts of exandria  liam what do you want to do with that thing  matt it pertains to what i think is a sound plan to bring thordak down to our level  liam well tell me a little bit more  matt i will tell you once we finish this next length of your journey since you are so eager to  have made the agreement  laura makes sense  liam i think youre lying through your teeth i think you want something youre not telling us  about but i do want the white dragon dead /none/ and we can work on it later  sam lets all agree that this is definitely bullshit  taliesin no im going to disagree i think that everything that she said is the truth and i think  that shes not saying an awful lot more deception is far less interesting if youre not telling the  truth all the time and i think shes telling a lot of truth just not nearly all of it  liam lies of omission are a tricky thing arent they  taliesin theyre far more tricky than simple lies and i think that /none/ weve heard an awful lot of truth  travis im confused  taliesin so yes im willing to work with what we have  marisha do you have any ideas on how to defeat vorugal  matt well for one thing i will be peripheral to the battle i will aid you but i cannot be  seen on the battlefield or thordak will know immediately there has been a turn of allegiance  laura so what good are you what can you do  sam can you shapeshift into other beasts  matt i can change my form into /none/ a number of creatures and be of assistance in that way i have  a series of arcane talents that i can bring to the battlefield as well  sam we needed a beast to bait vorugal with  laura i have an idea with that  taliesin i believe were all on the same page  marisha whats interesting is the way that stacks too  travis go ahead or do you want to save it  laura if were in this together can i say it in front of her  sam sure  travis no dont  /none/ sam well shell need to know at some point once we get there  travis i say we agree on principle we agree  taliesin yes we agree  travis i agree hands  sam what are we agreeing on  travis to fight with raishan  taliesin im in this far  sam you dont need our votes its already decided  travis youre abstaining i really wish you would vote your vote matters  sam is voting this time important particularly  liam jump on the carpet and go kill her anyway  sam but if i dont /none/ vote wont someone else vote for me  travis no you actually sway the vote in greater ways than you can possibly imagine very  important  sam i dont even know how is it easy to find out  travis im sure the internet has all your answers  sam i should go online and find out how to register to vote  liam look its never an easy choice but you have to fall down on one side or the other  scanlan  laura preferably one that doesnt rely on hate as a message  taliesin okay /none/ weve gone far enough off the track okay reeling it back  sam all right lets kill a dragon and feel that burn  laughter  liam oh chris hardwick as gern coming in for the political joke  sam all right im in for now  matt all right  marisha keyleth holds her hand out to shake her hand  liam i am drawing a blade behind my back  matt asum walks around the table slowly making eye contact with you those yellow reptilian  slits for eyes brushes past you youve grown quite a bit in /none/ just these few moments young keyleth  marisha i heat up my hands a little bit with my flame hands feel the burn  sam the dragon dies  laughter  matt she stands there keeping the grip and then releases your hand very well whats your plan  against vorugal  travis we need a moment i feel like the emotions in here are a bit raw can we please  taliesin we will reconvene tomorrow for battle plan for travel tomorrow morning to arrange  travel and the battle plan towards  sam shouldnt we keep an eye /none/ on this one all night  taliesin no  laura what we havent kept an eye on her the whole time  sam i know but she could be sneaking around creeping into rooms  taliesin that she hasnt already creeped into  matt i can guarantee you youre not wrong but i have been and i will regardless of what you try  sam she could come into my room at night and do things to me that i dont want to be done  travis lets be honest theres nothing  taliesin lets be fair  laura youre /none/ giving her ideas right now arent you  taliesin im not changing the status of the castle she has the same status she had before  theres no sense in changing them  sam im going to have sex with every beast on every continent  taliesin thank you captain kirk  matt singing gotta catch em all  laughter  taliesin im content with this  matt very well ill go check in with the boss if you will alleviate any concern on his end  taliesin thank you  matt we shall meet tomorrow  taliesin see you /none/ tomorrow  marisha can i get an insight check on that check in with the boss see if shes going to turn  around and tell him everything  laura natural 20  marisha come on natural 20 it wasnt bad it was a 15 so 26  travis thats not a 20  sam whispers  taliesin while youre whispering sams got another rap for you  sam do i  liam rapping whenever i go to the loot crate somebody kill me now cause of the embarrassment  im experiencing live in front of the internet  taliesin /none/ heyo  travis holy shit i was alive for that i was alive for that just now  liam i didnt have a sideways hat i needed a sideways hat  travis the glasses didnt help either  liam what is this manure movers of america  sam thats my hat  taliesin the feather shirt really adds the whole  laughter  sam yeah boi  matt raishan looks very confused  marisha all right lets go  matt very well see you tomorrow the image of the veins the scales everything reverts back to  normal seeker asum /town/ nods and leaves the room  taliesin downstairs to the real room to the real room downstairs downstairs to the real room  sam to the real war room magically incapable of  laura yes  sam okay but wait before we go down there two things keyleth can you scry today  marisha yes i can  taliesin do not  sam we could check in on vorugal make sure that vorugal is actually there  laura dont actually look at vorugal look at something near vorugal  sam just to make sure vorugal is in town and not /none/ here we could look into raishans room right now  and watch how it communicates with its boss  taliesin absolutely do not think thats a good idea  laura i dont think so either shell know  marisha yeah lets go down to the war room  sam shell go apeshit and what so we kill her were better than she is  taliesin were really not  liam shes obviously hiding shit from us and if one of us goes and pokes our nose in there shes  going to start a draw right there  marisha are /none/ we in the war room can we go down and talk about this in the war room  matt all right so you guys make your way through whitestone through the tunnels to the location of  the ziggurat the war room is a series of tables and chairs that have been assembled on the top of  the ziggurat near the spinning bead of death as you call it but yeah its makeshift its  functional theres currently nobody else in here even though there are a couple of guards stationed  to make sure that nobody comes in /none/ here without approval you are currently stepping up to the top  of the ziggurat and there it rests still spinning silently in place  travis drop it on them  laura i sit on the table whats going on  travis no tell them your plan  marisha keyleth screams her head off for a second  laura you did well dear  taliesin i know how hard that was i know and i wish i could say i did as well as you did when it  was my turn  marisha i dont think i understood until /none/ that moment what you did  liam youll have your day absolutely  taliesin we cant spy on her well we can spy on her but we have to be careful we shouldnt  spy on her when shes speaking to thordak because thordak might see it which would mean that plan  or no plan everything would be ruined  liam if thordak senses sees any one of us in the same place as her he will go mad  taliesin and then if i were her i would destroy this city and all of us as quickly as /none/ possible and run  laura i feel like she needs to talk to the spirit because shes going to try to absorb his power or  something  marisha shes a fucking idiot what do i know about melora and this curse because there are a  lot of druids who worship melora  matt make a religion check  marisha thats not good i never do religion checks nine  matt you know that melora is worshipped by druids of nature hunters societies that exist in a more  natural setting as well as ship captains oversea merchants in /none/ hopes of getting good luck in  getting across large bodies of water and weather she is considered by some to be good some  consider her to be in a neutral space and more of like a mother nature type entity amongst the  pantheon here if there was one and as far as curses go you dont have too much experience with  curses outside of the minor ones that youve seen used or have yourself at your disposal but even  just from the few of you sam especially sam go ahead and roll an intelligence check /none/  sam who me  matt yes  sam i need my thing hold on intelligence straight intelligence  matt yes  sam 16  matt 16 and you get to add your plus two  sam 18  matt and if you wanted to add your inspiration die  sam i will inspire myself which is d12 now right  matt yeah d12  sam 26  matt 26 okay  sam wow that escalated fast  matt thats what you can do as a bard its pretty rad through the two of you conversing over  this there /none/ are simple curses that can be imparted for a temporary period of time usually as some  sort of a penance to someone who slighted you some that are part of a corruption on the land a  blight that spreads to a life source and there are soul curses usually where someone feels so  wronged in their final moments that they basically burn their soul and any possibility of the  afterlife purely to scourge whoever was responsible for their pain its rarely ever done  because it is essentially accepting oblivion your existence is done the gods /none/ dont hold any sway  over your immortal soul there is no afterlife however you die knowing for whatever that means  in that brief moment that you have scarred the individual in some degree for possibly the rest of time  sam do we know anything about how it can be reversed or undone  matt no you have no idea youve heard of it in stories and as far as you know it was mainly a  folklore element and youre like okay no ive kind of heard of this so if there was anything this  might /none/ be it  liam i worry about her intentions with this thing help me remember when pike has spoken to  dead things they cannot lie  taliesin thats true  liam so she wants to talk to thordaks spirit who presumably cannot lie right  taliesin yes  liam which could mean the cure to this disease but it could mean something to do with that thing  taliesin it could it also and this is a third option sighs thordak could have tasked her with  bringing us to him in a way that he feels comfortable with /none/ and only then will he cure her  i believe he holds the cure as sway  marisha this whole thing could be an entire trap  taliesin which means that we do have an ally for defeating the white dragon  sam and taliesin and should use it  sam but then right after  taliesin well if the opportunity presents itself  sam or shake her  taliesin if the opportunity presents itself to kill her there in a way that is fitting and where  we have advantage then yes  liam away from this city  /none/ taliesin in draconia  laura we never mentioned jmon sa ord when we got back so asum does not know about that or raishan  doesnt know about that  marisha unless she was scrying on us which is highly possible  taliesin which is highly possible  laura do we have no way of having knowledge of when someone scries on us they can do it  taliesin sometimes we can notice but often  marisha i would have to have a super high perception in order to maybe sense it  matt if someone were to scry on /none/ you and you were to succeed on your saving throw they would fail  to scry and youd have some sort of inkling that something weird is going on if you are a person  whos capable of casting the spell like you are you would be like okay someones trying to peer  through the veil  laura so you would know she would know if someone was trying to scry on us  matt unless she  sam and matt if she picked up on it  matt you have no recollection of that happening  marisha is /none/ there a way i can start looking out for that  matt you can be very conscious of that possibility and keen on intercepting should  anything like that occur sure  taliesin the other thing that can happen is we can set different forms of attack when we finally  go against thordak so that we have our mode of entry and the way that we are going to be moving  that attack forward and make sure we have secondary lines of attack that she will have no  knowledge of that we will keep separated from her /none/  sam is there any way to move whitestone to reinforce whitestone to get something here to  protect whitestone  taliesin a bit but not a lot theres just not enough time  travis how many vestiges are left  liam and laura two  taliesin that we know of  laura speaking of vestige this is part of the plan so  marisha the spire of conflux was born from melora so im wondering  laura gasps the spire of conflux thats why weve heard of her  marisha yeah  laura shit  marisha oh ive been /none/ thinking about that staff for a while im wondering if i can get to the  staff quick enough it could be the key to really defeating raishan  laura its resting in the belly of a terrible beast in the abyss right  marisha correct  laura so gate scroll  marisha and vorugal loves something to hunt  laura what if we bring it through let it fight vorugal kill vorugal get the staff  marisha kill raishan i like this plan  laura not like anything could go wrong with it but  taliesin its a good /none/ start its brazen i like it  sam sighs  travis yes  taliesin theres no easy way to do this  sam we dont know what that thing is that has what the beast is  marisha apparently its a goristro a goristro  taliesin can i make a history check  marisha its a barista  taliesin theres no defeating a barista  marisha and shes really angry because its fall time pumpkin spice lattes  matt no id say this would be a religion check  taliesin not history itd be religion  travis i got this /none/  marisha on what a goristro is  matt let me doublecheck just to be sure specifically this is knowledge of fiends is what  this is  marisha apparently his name was yenk yank  matt yenk yenk  marisha and laura yenk  travis all those yanks  taliesin one day there will be a creature whose name we dont make fun of  liam and taliesin not this day  matt and every creature you make fun of is going to hurt that much more when it kills you  taliesin we are the peter parker of /none/ this game we walk around mocking things  matt its great its so wonderful  taliesin theres like this seventh ring of hell where theyre all hanging out going and then  they called me purvan  liam its pronounced purvin thats so much better  taliesin i was named after my grandfather man  matt id say honestly like i might give a religion check or a straight intelligence check  its going to be a hard dc for anybody that doesnt have any specific knowledge or training in  anything fiendcentric  marisha in anything fiendcentric  matt /none/ a goristro is a fiend it lives in the abyss most things in the abyss are fiends  sam you said religion  matt i said possibly religion if you have it trained if youre proficient in religion  laura can pike  matt you can go ask her  marisha shes here  taliesin ill send one of the guards to go bring her in  matt you wait about an hour pike quickly jogs up you hear the clanking of the armor as she  ascends the steps hey guys hi what do you need  travis barely /none/ heard you coming that time  matt oh thank you grog  laura pike have you ever heard of a goristro named yenk  matt no  laura nothing its a fiend in the abyss anything about a goristro  matt fiends are bad but i dont know anything about a goristro  laura at least you know how to pronounce it  taliesin do we have a library to consult  travis what would be wrong with summoning it what if its really bad  taliesin i think its a great idea the worst thing that happens is its /none/ going to have to fight  two dragons  sam its a cool idea but i dont think we can we need to know the beast that we are summoning  taliesin we have its name  marisha yeah we know what it is can we go to a library find a picture  liam maybe allura knows  laura where is allura we havent seen her in forever shes out  sam shes a dragon  taliesin they cant all be dragons  travis i have something to confess i farted  laura just now  travis yeah  /none/ taliesin does the little black orb absorb that and suddenly the demonportalhell opens  oh thats all it took  laughter  matt what do you guys want to do  taliesin im going to go research  laura yeah can we go in the library and look in the books there  matt sure okay whos going to the library okay those two whats everyone else doing  liam i need to talk to you for a minute  marisha okay i stare blankly into space  matt okay roll for perception no  grog scanlan what are you /none/ guys doing  sam nothing for us to do  travis what are you talking about were the masterminds of this portion of the adventure  sam youre right what do you want to do  travis ive got nothing  laura is there somebody religious outside of pike in the city oh yeah ask kash  matt kash is in vasselheim right now  taliesin but we do have priests we have two priests  matt you have keeper yennen  travis yeah ask him about a giant fiendbeast im sure they know all about it  sam all /none/ right grog and i will go talk to keeper yennen about yenk  travis yeah  taliesin you could also always pray to the raven queen  laura oh yeah you do have a shrine after all  matt well go with your guys conversation first vax and keyleth  liam come on thats a good idea lets go to the temple ive been thinking a lot about your longer  life that you told me about once youre leading your people youve come into your own yeah  marisha if i live past killing these dragons yeah  liam /none/ a thousand years or so yeah now ive thought a lot about that and i think we should  make a point of seeing that it happens well once you come out the other side of this i want that  for you  marisha what do you want i have a born duty to my people thats hard to escape  liam well if were all alive in a month we can work that out  marisha i guess well cross that bridge when we get there  liam in the meantime i want you to have this and /none/ i undo my cloak and shove it into her hands  marisha whispers which cloak  liam i only have one made from the  marisha oh the displacer cloak  liam im so used to you smashing across our enemies shouldertoshoulder with grog i get  complacent youre so strong i know that so much more powerful than i am lulled me into a false  sense of security but i cant have you gone i need you here so anything we can do to stack the  deck in your favor when you fell yesterday it shook me /none/  marisha seems to be a trend watching all of us fall  liam kiki will you wear that  matt youll have to attune to it on a short rest but you can do that while you guys are doing  that percy and vex could you guys roll an investigation check each of you percy minus  three because youre still suffering resurrection issues  laura investigation oh no this has nothing to do with dragons  sam its okay youre fine  laura ten  taliesin i did  laura did you get a 20 does it /none/ still count as a 20  taliesin yeah a 20s a 20  matt its still minus three whats your total  taliesin investigation 21 after that minus three but this is a natural 20  matt and ten all righty you guys spend the better part of the next two hours or so poring  through the various libraries you know them very well youve read through a lot of these growing  up there arent a lot of tomes or books that deal with anything terribly fiendish you do find one  that deals with tales of the /none/ betrayer gods its more of an old history tome that deals with  predivergence it deals with the founding which is the first era the age of arcanum which is the  second era this is all predivergence it speaks of the betrayer gods and many of their creations  and their followers that began to lay waste to civilization and began to enslave the creators of  those that remained on the side of light  you do see mention in there of various fiends and demons and princes of evil its all very thick  religious text but /none/ there is one page that has artwork on it sketched and simple but it shows  this strange almost long lithe vulturelike creature with wings and clawed hands and a  beaklike mouth called a vrock you see another section that has a woman but the lower half of  her body is serpentine like a snake and she has six arms carrying six different blades it says  marilith behind them you see a looming creature of hulking fur and muscle with fists like  battering rams a turned up puglike nose with a toothy jaw and giant horns /none/ adorned with brass  rings that curve forward under that it says goristro  laura did you find it  taliesin well thats intimidating  laura thats enormous  taliesin yes i think the dragon will be pleased  laura i hope the dragon kills it  taliesin im fine either way  laura well thats helpful  taliesin its very helpful whoever survives  laura we kill them no problem anyway and i leave we should probably show everybody what we found  liam it feels really thirdgrade in here all of a sudden  matt the awkward pause /none/ dissipates and you both bumble your way out of the library to find the others  taliesin we both go out the door at the same time  laura no you first  taliesin please  matt grog scanlan you guys make your way over to  sam we are the worst people for this mission  travis weve got this on lock  matt theres keeper yennen there with his small temple to erathis i believe theres nobody in  there currently its empty hes sweeping up with one of his assistants thats helping keep the  place clean /none/  sam tallyho keeper yennen  matt its been some time im glad to see that youre all safe and sound  sam yes well we come seeking knowledge that only you have maybe  matt well i am at your service what can i do  sam we needed some information about something that is beyond our scope  travis wait i dont know if hes cool man maybe you should check him  sam check him all right ill check him  matt what  travis yennen you keep your hands where i can see them  matt /none/ this is very  travis just keep them where i can see them  matt hes got the broom in front  sam im going to slowly touch his arms make sure hes real  matt your hands meet cloth and somewhat wrinkled older gentleman skin  sam ill pat him down  matt make an investigation check  sam 19  matt you find a small pouch seems to contain a few coins a somewhat stale piece of halfeaten  bread a couple of unlit candles thats about it  sam i sniff the bread sniffing hes clean  /none/ travis all right as you were  matt most unusual  travis dont worry cant be too careful  sam theres dragons around  matt right right thats all right he picks the bread up off the ground and puts it back in  his pocket  sam sorry about that  travis were actually hoping you have some information on a fiendish beast named lucas  sam nope  travis named victor  sam yenk yenk and he is a whats the type of beast a goristro  matt i have come across texts that speak of a goristro /none/ i do not know of one named yenk  specifically  sam well its very important that we know his name or her name accurately because well  for many reasons but we need to know its true name is there any text you can point us to  travis or tell us what you know of goristros  matt they were dangerous frontline behemoths when the fiends attacked these lands back in the  predivergence era they were 20plus feet tall and living battering rams that tore through stone  like it was paper  sam force is their /dung/ weapon not fire or any magic  matt i dont know the specifics but the texts i have read speak of it being an unstoppable fist in  the service of the dark princes  travis right now we are totally up to date on how to fight these things but we are also part of  a group thats making sure you are at your best in case they come round here if i were to ask you  how to fight one of these things what would you bring  matt everything  laughter  travis an interesting /none/ answer might you be a little less vague for my simple friend here  sam do they have any resistances acid poison fire  matt i have no idea unfortunately im not extremely well versed in fiendish things i know a  bit offhand from my teachings but its a very specific  travis i expected more really i did  sam are we going to play bad grog good gnome  travis i dont even know if its worth it at this point i expected more  sam oh youre going to guilt it out of him  matt /none/ im not withholding any information i genuinely  travis you want to protect whitestone right see its people to prosperity  matt thats what im doing  travis all right then maybe you should learn more about hellish fiends  matt weve rebuilt half the city  sam voice breaking grog i dont think i can im emotional thinking of all the people in  whitestone who are going to die  travis look what youve done  sam i cant keep it together is there any information you might know that can save your  people  matt strained /none/ i dont know and he rushes off toward his room you start hearing him turning  over blankets things tumbling onto the ground hes tearing through his room in the back of the  temple  travis well done youve got to lick your fingers and then wet  sam oh good yeah ooh  matt about ten minutes go by before he comes out sweat pouring down his face hes like panting  i have nothing im sorry  travis its all right we all have room to improve i suppose we know now where yours lies  you /none/ have your orders dont make me tell percy about this  matt make an intimidation check  liam that guys going to go back to his room and flagellate himself  sam were shaking down our friend  travis 24  matt he goes yes right of course i will further my research and perhaps i could send  someone to scour the rubble of the cobalt reserve it may take a couple weeks im so sorry  travis not a bad idea youve done lovely work in here by the way the rebuilding effort looks great  matt thank /none/ you  travis id like to see that passion in the rest of your projects thats all  sam is there anyone else who has knowledge that you can think of that we should speak to  matt not that still lives in the city unfortunately youre in the service of the  greatest minds of our city now up in the castle were trying to put homes up for those who need them  travis shit  laura yeah  sam thank you for your service to whitestone  matt also thank you for yours  sam weve had /town/ a weird rough week so sorry if we  matt apparently now so have i  travis just curious do you need any money for these homes or anything  matt cassandras taking care of the costs  travis right shit  matt shes sending up materials from the turst fields  travis you should know weve been taking surveys around the town like a b c people most  important in the rebuilding of whitestone and role models and youre always the first name  isnt that right scanlan  sam i dont think we can talk our way /none/ out of this one  travis im just trying to make him feel better its you  sam youre top five in whitestone for sure  matt i appreciate its very kind  travis youre doing good work strained all right  matt i have a lot of sweeping to do if you dont mind  sam we did a good thing in there grog  matt the assistant is over there wideeyed watching this whole circumstance hes a young  maybe 17yearold boy in a similar robe sebastian stop staring and help me clean  yes sir they both /none/ start sweeping the rest of the temple as you guys walk out  sam hes going to kill you someday  travis we clearly got the most info out of anybody  sam i think we got all there was highfive  matt all right the two of you finally make your way to the recently constructed temple of the  raven queen that percy had built what would you like to do  liam i want to go in and have a moment pray  matt okay  liam so i will go in and kneel down where percival /none/ showed me and stay quiet for a few  minutes then ask a couple of questions i havent spoken in a while im trying to grow stronger  whatever it is you need maybe it is selfish but i seek vengeance against my mothers killer once  i have it i will go to the ends of this world for you to help me go stronger is there anything you  can tell me about the fiend named yenk we need to use it  matt roll a religion check  laura you can do it  liam i will /none/ stick with that no ill stick with that 21  matt 21 the door still left ajar to the temple as keyleth walked in earlier a bit of a breeze  swirls in for a second carrying a few leaves they scatter around come to rest the candles  flicker for a moment and the light dims ever so slightly nothing beyond that from your  perspective keyleth you vax feel a familiar cold embrace its interesting its chilling and  causes your skin to goosebump but its still comforting while you see nothing within your  closed eyes you /none/ can sense a pair of cold lips to your left ear that whispers toward you knowledge  of this is earned you seek this with your allies some have already found secrets i can only say  that the path you walked to the sphinx gave you what you need stay alive you feel the lips fade  from your ear warmth comes back to your sides and your eyes flicker open knowing that her  presence is no longer there  marisha any luck  liam sort of she told me something but im too stupid to understand  /none/ marisha i dont think thats true gods really enjoy being vague whatd she say  liam she said that the path to the sphinx told us everything we want to know  marisha which sphinx weve seen two now  liam she didnt say  marisha damn it why do they have to be so cryptic  liam because they can  marisha ugh  liam come here thats on crooked  marisha i dont think i wear it as well as you its a little baggy  liam heres to a thousand years of you  marisha that made /none/ me a little nauseous lets go  matt as you guys all go to convene in castle whitestone to discuss the next length of your  plan

preparation  for whatever you wish to do going forward  liam this is before beddybye time  matt yeah you guys are still  taliesin ive a few things i think we should do  laura okay  marisha i think theres a lot we need to do  taliesin first i think we should brew some tea and not drink it  laura oh it only lasts for how long  travis what  laura the venomous tea  matt itll probably last for the day  /none/ laura all right yeah itll last for 24 hours  sam so wait you want to make poison and not do anything with it  laura well keep it  marisha just in case  sam in case someone comes over for tea  marisha emergency poison  travis why wouldnt you make it in front of her and then its way less conspicuous  laura gasps thats true lets make some and put it a flask and then well do it later  liam are you talking about for raishan  taliesin no just to have some poison  /none/ liam shes a poisonous dragon  laura just to have some poison in general not necessarily for raishan  taliesin maybe well make it in the morning  liam maybe an enemy will come over youre right  marisha maybe an enemy will come over  matt as a specific master of dragon and dragon knowledge so youre aware green dragons are  laura poison  matt poison by nature  laura i dont think this is for raishan  matt okay  taliesin i was actually thinking if we had a bit of poison and if we could get /none/ it into the system  of one of the larger creatures at some point a big pot of poison maybe  laura i knew you didnt think it was for raishan  taliesin raishans not going to drink tea and die  marisha right internet we knew it wasnt for raishan  matt laughs all right  taliesin yeah i want to go downstairs and i want to see if grog will give me all of the guns  to go upstairs and look at our giant cache of guns that we suddenly have  marisha and taliesin all the /none/ guns  sam that reminds me on the walk home with grog i turn to him and say oi grog got any of those guns  travis i do  sam how many  travis two pistols two rifles really long skinny guy and ive got a greatsword  sam why should percy have all the fun what say you and me take a pistol each just as a backup  plan an insurance policy  travis i dont want a pistol how about you take one  sam you dont want a pistol  travis no  sam youd /none/ look so cool  travis its not as intimate as what i do  sam you are about the personal touch  travis i need the connection  taliesin what are the actual chances that he will even know how to operate it im not talking to  either of you im talking to the powers that be  travis itd be like a little gi joe handgun do you want a pistol  sam do you have any ammo  travis i do i have 185 rounds  sam holy shit  travis so i take out one of /none/ the two pistols do they look the same  matt they look comparable yes  travis which one  sam is there any blood on either of them  travis are there  matt a little smattering on each of them yeah  travis ill give you the super bloody one  sam i want the bloody one  travis yeah i toss it to him and i give him  laura six ammo laughs  travis laughs 15 rounds of ammo  sam thank you grog thank you very much i dont know what to do with this so /none/ ill pocket it  travis im pretty sure if you look into it  laura dont even encourage that  sam ive seen percy do that a lot stares right down the barrel and make sure its working  travis yeah thats where the expression comes from right down the barrel  taliesin dont do that at home kids just dont do that  laura just dont  matt all right so you go looking for grog who is not around the castle and eventually as you step  out you notice scanlan and grog both walking up the pathway /none/ to the front of whitestone castle  taliesin oh good we need to go through the guns we need to see what we have we need to clean them  up ive got a plan  travis yeah right yeah we need to sniffs you need to clean up the guns  taliesin i do i need to clean up the guns  travis who has those guns i have the

cloak  travis for what  taliesin the guns i thought we were making a trade here  travis yeah no we are  taliesin all right do you want a cloak then  liam a vestige  taliesin no ive just got a cloak  laughter  travis what does it do  taliesin it looks smashing and its quite warm  travis its a cloak of smashing  taliesin yes it is a cloak of smashing  travis deal all right i will /none/ trade you that for the long barrel thing  taliesin ill need them all  travis in a minute  taliesin no i need them all i really dont have anything else  sam you dont have any guns what happened to your guns  taliesin well no i need to clean  travis what about your glasses  taliesin chuckles i sort of need those glasses  travis do you  taliesin yes  travis give me your glasses just let me hold them show us some faith  sam were friends here right grog  taliesin is everybody /none/ here is everybody watching us  matt just the three of you guys and three guards back by the front of the castle  sam i dont know what hes doing i would not trust him but then again you dont have a choice  taliesin i dont trust him either i did have siblings im aware of how this happens  travis how many fingers am i holding up  taliesin four  travis was he right  sam he was right  travis i dont know why you need the glasses  taliesin i need the glasses because /none/ i cant see things that are up close i can see things that  are far away perfectly fine  travis how many fingers am i holding up  taliesin i dont know  travis is he right  sam he doesnt know  laughter  travis very well you passed glasses and i give him the two rifles  taliesin he also has ripleys gun  matt yes  taliesin why dont we come inside so i can explain to you my plan so that you can feel good  travis no this is very important for me out /none/ here i have a position of power and im not  about to give it up what else have you got  taliesin i have a title i can title you  sam oh yes title him  taliesin would you like a title  travis take note scanlan this is how you get shit done im listening  taliesin all right i will title you if you give me everything that i need i need all the  ammunition all the guns especially the complicated guns im going to need everything  travis yeah i have one other pistol /none/ i have 170 rounds for the little bitty guy and ive got 26  rounds for the belches rifles  taliesin all right  travis do you want the full plate armor and the greatsword too  taliesin no plate armor and greatsword are completely up to you  travis belches okay i give it all over whats my title  taliesin grand poobah de doink of all of this and that  sam grand poobah de doink of all of this and that  taliesin of all of this and that it comes with no money and no land /none/ but it is a title  sam im unfamiliar with protocol a grand poobah how do you address them is it a your majesty a  your highness your grace  taliesin no its hey you over there hey you guy  sam hey you guy  travis yes my humble servants  taliesin sweet chestnut  travis are those all official names  taliesin oh yes theyre used in very different ways  travis well look lets keep it on the lowlow right i dont want too many people getting  jealous so like only in private quarters will /none/ you address me by my official title  taliesin okay or the shortened versions thereof  travis yeah which i look forward to learning  taliesin you will enjoy them im sure we will all enjoy them  sam this is a great day grog  travis it is right man i just keep coming up in the world coming up against all the odds i  feel like an eminem song in the background right now eight mile bitches lets go inside  taliesin didnt even bother to insight check did you thats great that makes me so happy /none/  sam percy dont forget you promised me one of those guns  taliesin id actually have to teach you how to use it you are aware of that  sam maybe you can teach me first and when ive learned you can give me one  taliesin maybe well have that conversation im going to take a look at their various levels of  repair i want to take a look at how they look how many of them need work how many of them are  at least functional  matt most of them need work a number /none/ of them backfired during the actual battle and the other  ones were not taken very good care of so youre probably going to need to run a few repair checks  on that you have the materials at your disposal you have your workshop  taliesin im going to do this not in private but im going to be then i want to look at ripleys gun  matt okay you take a good solid look at animus get a feel for it  travis ive got it  matt thank you travis  sam belches  laura wow /none/  taliesin oh my god really  liam that was laura baileyesque  travis can i find vax while hes looking for the gun  matt yep  laura yeah i want to go find vax and keyleth as well  travis im sorry i meant vex  laura oh me  travis yeah you  laura you want to find me hi whats up  travis hey so remember when you showed me your boobies during the fight with kern  laura oh you saw them  travis only out of the peripheral  laura okay yes  travis /none/ i wanted to say thank you on a very delayed timeline by giving you this potion of  superior healing  laughter  laura thank you so much grog  travis yeah so if they ever get jacked up again heal them because i fight better with boobies  around  laura ill remember that  travis okay cool  laura all right  travis deal  laura thank you so much  taliesin this is mean  liam that was spectacular  taliesin i missed everything ill watch it on the preview because this is a  marisha isnt /none/ it breast cancer awareness month it is right  taliesin now im aware  marisha check your boobs ladies  laura its important  liam dont let them get jacked up  taliesin okay im going to do my best to clean and work on these guns tonight and at some point  im going to send a guard to find vax  matt vex youve gone and looked for vax and keyleth after you guys had your conversation  about everything eventually you catch up to are you guys still together yeah so you find the two  of /none/ them  laura hey did you find anything  liam sort of i wanted to talk to you and probably percival as well  laura yes  liam well i communed with my deity  laura and marisha the raven queen  liam thats the one and she said something that i dont know what she meant  laura okay  liam i asked about this yenk and she said everything we needed to know we saw on the way to  the sphinx  laura which one  marisha thats what i said  liam she didnt say  /none/ laura okay  liam im drawing a blank i dont know  laura everything we need we saw on the way to the sphinx  liam so i remember the more recent trip better what happened the first time  laura well its here  liam it was under the slayers take  laura no  liam yes under the slayers take  laura but there was a ziggurat as well  liam yes then the second time  laura we went down a cavern and there was a name  marisha right had to do the whole name trial /none/  liam grog almost drowned  marisha so the first one was near where the cindergrove is  laura right and she worshipped the goddess of knowledge  marisha osysa was her name  liam we just spoke to her  matt osysa was the gynosphinx who works at the slayers take the goddess she worships is ioun  laura and marisha ioun  laura so maybe we need to talk to ioun no maybe we just talk to a god thats impossible unless youre  liam i just did it yeah but i didnt understand what she told me /none/ so six of one half a dozen of  the other  laura worthless really yeah thats a nice cloak you have there keyleth  marisha its a little baggy but thank you  liam i gave you a cloak once and you stopped using it  laura this is true it looks lovely though stacked next to the rest of my clothing do you  want it back  liam no i do not want it back  laura he only gives cloaks to those he really cares about keyleth really cares about  liam this is really awkward /none/ and im going to walk the fuck out of here good night ladies  marisha i got a wink from vex  liam i go off looking for percy  taliesin good man  matt while they share their awkward smile you find percival down in his workshop currently  repairing weaponry with ripleys gun placed down out on its own in the middle of the table  liam hello  taliesin oh good its you  liam do you mind  taliesin not at all i was actually hoping you would stop in  liam gods what does all /none/ this shit do  taliesin mostly break quite successfully  liam just like us i just broke in the temple that you  taliesin i assume it was vague and unhelpful  liam it was  taliesin excellent  liam first i dont think i ever officially thanked you for it  taliesin youre welcome  liam thank you how are you feeling buddy  taliesin sighs im terrified but other than that i think im good  liam i came here for a reason youre the brain youre the one that hangs brain i dont know what  to /none/ make of my conversation with the higher power i asked about yenk i asked what we should do and  she talked about the sphinxes she said that everything that we needed to know we learned on  the way to the sphinx i dont know which one i dont know if it was the gynosphinx or the  notgynosphinx  taliesin i would assume it was the sphinx that was guarding her treasure oh you should take a  look at this and i point at the open book with the picture look what we have that is our /none/ friend  marisha oh is that yenk  laura well its one of yenks brethren  liam did you follow me down here i said i didnt fucking want to  laura well obviously keyleths there so i figured i was too  marisha i thought you were working in the middle of  taliesin my doors open im in my thing but its open and ive already sent people to send for  marisha i said hi percy its not my fault no one notices im around its not my fault im a  fucking wallflower  liam you /none/ scared the shit out of me this is some nasty business this is what were dealing with  taliesin yes and if all goes well which it never does that will be fighting the white  dragon and possibly the green dragon and one of the two of them will kill the other and then we  swoop in and clean up whats left  liam i dont know if its smart but im really curious  taliesin i know i understand i feel the same way its probably not going to work its  probably going to go terribly /none/  liam i think it might  taliesin i think it might work im feeling good about that  laura do we even know how to use the gate scroll exactly scanlan has to use it right  liam yeah the little guy can pull it off  marisha its going to have to be either scanlan or me but  sam hey guys  marisha scanlan hey  sam door was open thought id come in grogs right outside in the hall  marisha hey grog come on in  liam have you ever been here look at all /none/ this fucking esoteric bullshit  travis wow  sam its crazy is that a brain in a jar  taliesin no yes that is something in a jar its not a brain though  travis whats that a picture of  laura oh thats the goristro  travis oh what are the other ones  laura well one is called a snake lady a marilith  travis are they all together or is it the one guy  laura i think its just the one guy hopefully other things cant come through can they read  that scroll again scanlan /none/  sam what my gate scroll yeah well i left that at home today but i think it calls the thing that  you call for you give it a name it goes it grabs it it brings it in  laura it doesnt bring other things through doesnt leave the gate open  sam the gate does stay open for as long as your conjuration which is about a minute  laura so other things could come through  sam yes that is true  marisha but you could close the gate once it passes through  sam i /none/ could drop it yes however this is a tricky spell for me because i am not as much as  it pains me to say this i am not good enough to cast this spell  liam youre selling yourself short  sam im really good but im not quite that good so i can cast it but it carries a risk if luck  is not on my side it will not work  travis like it burns when you pee risk or its going to fall off in three months risk  sam like it wont work forever /none/ i get one shot if i dont do it right its gone forever  travis are we talking about your penis still  sam yes my penis will fall off  travis that is terrible  laura we will have raishan with us  sam im not giving this thing to raishan but do we know anyone who is at a slightly higher skill  level than me  liam allura or gilmore  marisha also kima wanted to come with us to fight the white dragon remember  sam is she an arcane caster  marisha shes not but /none/ if kima is going then maybe allura will  travis we cant bring them wed have to tell them that raishans with us  laura no we wouldnt raishan will be in disguise  liam raishan has had everyone fooled for a long time  sam do we know where kima and allura are  matt you havent checked in to see if theyre here or not  laura oh they could be at the castle  matt they wouldnt be at the castle they stay at one of the houses at the northern end of the city  travis /none/ should i call for a guard  taliesin call for a guard  travis loudly guard  taliesin theres one literally down the hall  travis oh stage whisper guard  matt who has now arrived and steps up you called grog  travis yeah no please dont use my official title if you would could you go see if lady kima  and lady allura are around  matt do you wish for me to fetch them  travis yes go forth quickly with haste  matt he rushes off you hear the armor and chainmail clinking in the /none/ distance  laura what time is it  matt its midafternoon you guys have spent the day doing research and checking things out you  woke up in the morning and you had your conversation with raishan so its two three in  the afternoon  marisha i have another question how far are we timeline in the year how close are we getting to  winters crest  matt you are close to three months past it so you have a ways to go before its winters crest  again  marisha whens the next solstice  matt the /none/ celestial solstice youre not sure actually make a nature check  marisha theres not a summer solstice and winter solstice  matt there are solstices yes  marisha 24  matt 24 the next solstice is going to be in about a month roughly 28 days  laura whatever relevance that has  travis so none at all  taliesin no i see what youre getting at  marisha thordak was busted out on the winters solstice right also the briarwoods were rushing  to try and get the ziggurat up and running in time for the solstice  laura /none/ right important day is that  marisha very important day where nature and stars tend to align and planes can blur a little bit  travis can i ask a quick question i really like this plan to use the gate thing and go attack  vorugal i dont even feel like we need raishan for it shouldnt we lure her away to somewhere  and then fucking kill her  taliesin this is luring her away somewhere  marisha the sooner she dies the happier ill be  laura we get her over there and then we kill her /none/ afterward  travis but well be weak and shes on the fringe because remember shes barely helping out  sam what is she going to be doing to help us anyway  travis we havent decided  laura she was going to be another magic user dressed as a human or something  travis i like tricks but ripley got us pretty good and i dont feel like walking right into  another trap one week before another fight  liam i think better to get raishan away from here and in that fray she might not be touched  /dung/ but she might be whittled down a little bit thats better than nothing  taliesin shell spend some power  liam we have to get her away from whitestone we have to  travis i guess we couldnt get her anywhere with a low ceiling where her dragon form doesnt have  such an advantage  taliesin i think the ceiling would give  travis no i mean a cave or something  sam we could do that  taliesin how  marisha vorugal lived in a cave  laura yeah but a little cave a cave that asum would /dung/ fit in  matt that wasnt a cave it was inside a chasm a giant ravine  taliesin i think far away on another continent is a great idea  travis what about the little cave in glintshore  taliesin im happy just to take her shes going to follow us already  marisha well heres my question im sure shes anticipating us turning on her what would you do  if you were a green dragon anticipating people turning on you  taliesin it depends if i needed them i would put myself in a position of safety make /none/ myself  useful and then make sure i was back somewhere where they would not attack me as quickly as  possible if i didnt need them i would turn on them immediately after the fight  liam shes going to put out the barest amount of effort to help us from behind  taliesin if we die her plan foils if we do not feel she put in enough effort her plan also foils  travis i picture thordak going raishan use your treachery and intellect and go kill vox machina  taliesin my feeling is use your treachery /none/ where are we were in my shop right now okay  marisha keep that in mind we could be getting spied on are we being watched  matt you have no sense of being watched by any exterior force  liam also we know were walking into this shit thats no surprise  sam and our plan doesnt necessarily have to be kill vorugal turn and kill raishan right there  we can keep playing with her for a little while longer  laura she can sense lies  travis all right so we buck up we go through with /none/ it  taliesin we go through with it we made an agreement i say we honor it until such point as  it is deeply inconvenient  travis im down  laura can i go find zahra  matt you can yes  taliesin vax your boy  liam arguably so yeah  taliesin your boy im thinking of creating a company of shot for the castle with these guns do  you think that would be a position that would suit him guards that would be forbidden from carrying  these weapons outside the walls of the castle itself /none/ and would arm the parapets if there was an  attack from a dragon  liam i do i dont know how good a judge of character i am though  taliesin hopefully a better judge than i am  liam you know i have faceplanted more than any of you maybe i have with that boy i can see it  in his eyes were up to our elbows in blood there has to be room for a little bit of  redemption in this world  taliesin im a big believer in second chances at least i am /none/ now  liam its a good idea  taliesin i wanted to check with you i thought this was something that i assumed you would have  some insight into  liam do we have time to teach them how these things work  taliesin he may already know a bit he spent some time around them which is also why i thought it  might be helpful  liam do you want to talk to him  taliesin well i figured we would talk to him im still not 100 we are going to be fighting  these dragons /none/ and i am not at my best  liam well you probably need to get to bed but why dont we go find him before it grows too late  taliesin ill continue to work on these bring him down when you find him  liam i will thank you i head out  matt okay percy can you make three tinkering checks for me  taliesin tinkering check  matt yes  sam three  taliesin stop that where did all my dice go okay apparently i have three dex proficiency  if i recall okay thats a 29 /none/ a 27 and a 13  matt okay rudimentary in their design but functional you manage to clean them all and  repair the ones that were heavily damaged earlier and make them functional again without an issue  during that time keyleth you were going to mention something you said  travis and zahra  marisha what did you say about ioun and why is ioun important right now  matt ioun is the god of knowledge and spreading of knowledge and was what the temple that osysa  watches beneath the slayers take is based around its also /none/ what the ziggurat beneath the city used  to be a temple to ioun before it was corrupted by the briarwoods  marisha scanlan do you still have those ioun stones  sam i have an ioun stone  marisha okay was ravens slumber the name of the temple  laura thats my necklace  marisha thats your necklace thats got trinket in it  laura when were not in the city hes out of the necklace yes hes always around  marisha what if we go back to that temple  sam and do what  matt vax is /none/ gone right now  laura im also gone  taliesin shes been helping me clean  marisha never mind keep going im just trying to figure this out  matt all right vex you go ahead and find zahra whos in the process of still researching in her  room her and allura while she was focusing on the ziggurat and the essence of it so you find  her and her tomes are spread out and shes actually fallen asleep on her desk in her room  laura knockknock zahra  matt puts her wand out in your direction /none/ darling im so sorry i didnt mean that  laura how are you how are things  matt tiring if anything she wipes this bit of drool from the side of her chin immediately sits  upright in her chair  laura i never noticed the drool dont worry  matt chuckles good just trying to figure out what we can from these siphons  laura anything interesting  matt not yet though its been a lot of fun throwing things into them and watching them go away  laura speaking of youve been very busy i know with all /none/ of your research but do you remember  what we spoke of before we left  matt remind me  laura arrows of dragonslaying  matt oh yes i was able to muster one  laura okay thats wonderful one is better than none  matt that is all ive been able to get done in time she pulls out a small case and opens it it  looks a little roughshod not quite as perfect but she says the enchantment took  laura wonderful this is costly what do i owe you  matt oh for this lets find /none/ out  laura i hope this isnt a lot  travis 5000 gold  matt that would come to roughly on the market about 30000 gold pieces  laura but she made it so thats not how much it would be right zahra said it wasnt that much before  matt its mostly done i could keep working on it if you like and make it all done  laura oh okay but thats 30000 gold pieces  matt well for cost and time id put it more about 12 for a friend  laura jesus man  travis better /none/ make it work then better wait  laura ill wait you keep making this awesome  matt okay sorry dear i havent had a lot of time  laura dryly no i know youre so busy  liam the romance is over  laughter  laura mark it back down to one in my zahra youre amazing  liam dryly no its great its super cool  laura were going into battle pretty soon these fuckers are pretty dangerous so im concerned  matt so should i balk on the research and focus on  laura keep doing what youre /none/ doing if you find the time  matt noted  laura thank you zahra  matt no worries dear i should make some tea she rubs her eye a little bit gets up have a  good night vex walks by as she exits the room as you stand there her tail whips you in the back  laura i deserved that  liam mary is going to see this  laura mary said it was only five okay  taliesin mary says a lot of things  travis did kima and allura show up yet  matt kima shows /none/ up  travis kima shows up kima  matt as she walks up its midday shes not armored at all shes wearing a standard linen  shirt thats sweat through it looks like shes been doing physical labor work and she comes up  with dirt smeared in her face grog its been a while  travis it has yeah you little badass  matt chuckles you big badass what can i do for you  travis oh yeah the thinkers are inside the room  sam hey wheres allura  matt do you need me to get her as /none/ well  sam yeah the guard was supposed to get you both  matt ugh ill be right back she leaves for a bit you wait a little bit longer  eventually she comes back with allura allura not quite as dirty as kima they both arrive hello  im glad to see youve returned can i help you  sam yes i dont normally need to ask for help with magic but this gate scroll that i have here  is this something that you can do  matt this is beyond my magic  sam forget i ever /none/ showed it to you doesnt exist  matt no this is incredible this is very powerful magic  sam i know its really cool but you shouldnt know about it its bad news  matt i think it has quite a bit of utility to be honest do you need this or could i  sam no i do need it desperately yes its very vital to our mission  matt well all right  travis whoa wait do you have a use for it in mind in particular  matt well this is the kind of spell that i /town/ could copy into my spellbook and once im able to  utilize it down the road it would be at my disposal  sam would that make this scroll inactive  matt it would destroy the scroll but i would be able to utilize the spell in a few years maybe  travis how long does it take to copy down the scroll a couple seconds  matt it takes a few hours maybe  travis what is this voice im hearing  laura i just wandered back im done talking to zahra hey the doors open  matt be /none/ careful with that from what i can glean from the enchantment it offers you quite a chance  to pull pretty much anything to your side but no real bindings on what you pull through  sam yes i think i understand how it works but i dont know if ill be able to do it when the time comes  travis no bindings on what comes through you might get more than you bargained for  matt there are many a mage who ended up trying to bend something to their will and werent seen  ever again  /none/ sam i think what shes referring to is once we pull the thing through it acts of its own  volition we cant tell it what to do  laura we stay clear  travis okay but will its friends come through  sam probably not  travis probably is good enough for me  sam sighs all right  laura once we pull it through how do we keep it in place long enough for  sam we dont we pull it through right in front of  laura how do we get in front of  sam i /none/ could be invisible  travis allura thank you so much for your time please dont let us disturb you any longer  matt no worries im about to ready continuing to strengthen the veil with shaun  sam also i dont know if youd heard but tiberius fell  matt oh im sorry to hear that these are dangerous times ive got something ive got to  do stay safe be careful with that she walks out of the room a little dazed and rubs the top  of kimas head and you watch her leave  laura how is /none/ she  matt shes stretched a little thin these days to be honest  laura her and gilmore both  matt well theres a lot going on and a lot needs to be found and a lot needs to be done  and a neverending barrage of responsibility which i despise where are you guys off to  laura well something you might enjoy actually  matt really you see this big toothy grin curl across her face and her fingers twitch so  laura feel like killing a dragon  matt excited chuckles i was hoping youd say that /none/ let me get my armor how soon when  travis pretty soon we only save you for the big fights  matt all righty stay right here ill be right back she darts off with a spring in her step and  a little chuckle as she heads down the hall  travis quick before she comes back  laura no  travis what it would be the best bag ever come on  sam wont she ask why asum is with us  laura no  travis yeah  marisha heres what i think shes going to find out /none/ eventually and then what do we say when they all  know weve known the whole time  travis look when we start attacking seeker asum then we kill kima what shes probably a dragon too  laura shit i totally did that didnt i but she wanted to come and fight the dragon im an idiot  travis look we dont have to tell her as soon as we hit raishan shell reveal herself anyway  that was our agreement not tell right  marisha but then what happens when kima goes did you guys know  taliesin yes /none/  travis yeah she didnt ask  sam paints us as pretty shady folk  marisha these are the people we need to trust us they are our allies  taliesin she has kept secrets from us and we have a perfectly legitimate reason for not  telling  travis im with percy on that  marisha that was also years ago  taliesin no we have a very fine we still have a perfectly reasonable reason for not telling  anyone which is that if we tell people the city gets destroyed  laura and they get destroyed  /none/ taliesin you are welcome to tell her and then we have to deal with the city being destroyed  travis plus kima is a total bash brother and if she gets to find out she gets to kill two dragons  instead of one i dont think shes going to be upset  sam i dont know were putting her in a lot of danger  taliesin as opposed to staying here  marisha and we were aware and we could have told her she going to be angry at not telling her the  full parameters  taliesin she /none/ will  travis yeah did see her though shes sweaty shes working on the outside of houses  marisha this is not someone we want to lose our trust  sam she could help protect the city it could go under siege  taliesin shes a soldier theyre used to not being told things  marisha no she is not a soldier in our manifested army she is our friend and ally there  is a difference right now this is a different duty and relationship  laura i feel like i got us into this and im really sorry /none/ about that  sam we can get her out of it really quickly  taliesin we can tell her not to come  sam we can tell her that it never happened  travis you saw how excited she was its her choice if shes our friend and ally let her choose  sam shell choose a fight every time  travis yeah  marisha but shell choose a fight unaware of exactly what shes getting into  taliesin well we can make that clear then tell her that there are aspects of this fight that  sadly must remain /none/ secret that its far more dangerous than we could possibly even explain  travis yep what he said  taliesin and that things may go completely titsup  marisha this is lady kima we are talking about she is one of the most hardheaded people we know  she is going to push until we tell her what happened  taliesin even if we tell her the truth shes still going to want to come  marisha so then either we tell her the truth and trust that she can keep a secret or she doesnt  come shes going /none/ to find out and i dont want to lose her trust  taliesin i dont want to tell her  marisha percy  taliesin no im happy for her not to come because i dont want to tell her because i dont trust  marisha i dont trust anyone right now  taliesin i barely trust us to keep this secret let alone another person  travis oh my god honestly all right to a vote  laura what are we voting on  travis whether we bring kima or not  marisha shes going to be mad at us /none/ either way so it depends on if shes mad at us now or even  more angry at us later  travis i want her to fight a dragon all those in favor of kima not going to fight a dragon raise  your hand all those in favor of kima going to fight a dragon raise your hand  laura youre abstaining  liam im not there  laura oh shit  travis i grab my earring im like vax where are you can you hear me  liam im sure im more than 500 feet away  matt /none/ yeah  marisha well look shes then going to wonder why we uninvited her we are lying to her no  matter which way we take right now  sam if you want i can wipe her memory of the fact that we offered  travis oh my god  laura if she finds out she is going to be really super pissed  taliesin im okay with this plan  travis removing an ally from a fight  laura i feel like she should come  travis taking one of the guns and going nah i want that gun /none/ to trust me  marisha look i want her there more than anything i dont want to lie to her and i also  dont want her dead and i dont want to drag her into a situation she could have known more about  sam i defer to the grand poobahs will i will change my vote to yes  travis there could be ears listening  sam i know dont worry ill wipe their minds too lets bring her  taliesin you really wont  laura lets do it  marisha so were bringing her  sam yes /none/ and whats our plan do we go to sleep and wake up and go how do we get there  taliesin we go in the morning  sam how are we getting there  laura tree stride  sam were going to burn her spell in the morning to get there shouldnt we go now sleep there  taliesin no i was assuming we would go there tomorrow set everything up and then have it  happen the day after we can go camp in our house deep in  sam with raishan in my house raishans not getting in /none/ the mansion ever  travis by the way that twoweek time period we had how far into that are we  sam two days  matt yeah you got a handful of days left  travis okay just checking  taliesin we go there we set up raishan can handle herself  sam fine lets go  marisha were going well you know what ive got to handle something first  sam oh boy  matt while this is happening vax eventually you find your way to the makeshift training  barracks that are established on the northeastern side of /dung/ the city where kashaw was earlier training  recruits you can see now that this late in the afternoon most of the training has come to a  halt but jarett is still in the process right now of instructing kynan kynan has been given more  standard whitestone armor to get rid of the dark roguish look that he had before partially to help  him mentally feel like hes in a different place and has some connection to the city but jarett is  in the process now of working him through some swordplay as you approach the /none/ two of them stop  and jarett looks over towards you ah vax it is good to see you what can we do for you  liam well first hows he coming along  matt well hes a bit rough around the edges but hes actually a pretty decently trained fighter  liam yeah id agree with that  matt kynans quiet  liam im on de rolo business right now can i borrow the boy  matt i dont know do you want to be borrowed  i suppose did i do anything  liam no youre fine take /none/ a walk with me  matt sure  liam i need to head back to the castle  matt let me just and he hands the blade over to jarett who takes it and sheathes it on the side  liam jarett hell be back tomorrow for a little more all right  mat all right i shall prepare dont do anything stupid boy he smiles and comes up and  starts walking with you but keeps about a foot and a half two feet between the two of you he seems  to still be putting a boundary there /none/  liam hey listen to me i wanted to give you a little more time i wanted to and i dont think  we have it things are moving fast you didnt know what was going on i dont fault you i fault  myself that day you showed up look at me i had a point but i made sport of you while making it  and that is on me and im sorry for it  matt im sorry too i should have taken it for the lesson it was and i was too dumb and young to /none/  let it get through my thick skull  liam hey man im a little bit older than you but im a massive fucking shithead ive made  plenty of mistakes and i only knew how easy it was for shit to blow up in your face and now it  has percival and i want to offer you a means of squaring yourself off  matt what do you need  liam this city is in danger and it needs people watching it and i know youre training percy  im sorry percival has a task for you and /none/ i think its well suited for you you were around  ripley you were around her other men and you know how to use a sidearm  matt ive toyed with it i wouldnt say im a great shot by any means  liam sure but the number of people who know how to use those things i can count on two hands  here we have guns now we need people to use them so i want you to come and talk to percival  for a bit and were going to work out a plan for you to /dung/ show some people the ropes  matt all right okay  liam this is your second chance i dont doubt youre going to make the best of it i truly do  not and again i was going to wait on this because i can see the pain in your eyes but there  isnt time and i want you to be well equipped so i want you to take these and i hand him two of  the three daggers that i bought that day and i take out the keen dagger which requires  attunement these are mine /none/ and now theyre yours water under the bridge and i dont want to hear a  word just walk with me to de rolo  matt okay thank you  liam im sorry  matt im sorry he walks along with you eventually leading you back to percys workshop  where the instruction is given for the weapons anything beyond that he doesnt understand about  the rifles nothing construction general outfitting he seems to be more of an adept  student than you expected hes got some intellect to him at the very least he can pick up the /none/  details pretty quick quick learner when he puts his mind to it  about this time as youre having this discussion you can hear the bounding of armored feet and  bursting through the partially open door you see fully armored eager hair pulled back in a tight  braid big old maul scraping on the stone behind her all right when are we doing this  taliesin tomorrow  matt tomorrow thats  laughter  matt does it have to be tomorrow  sam why what are you doing tomorrow  matt its really quiet here im getting /none/ extremely bored  sam oh you want to go now  matt i mean whenever you need to im just saying  sam we could go now and camp there  taliesin thatll give kik a chance to replenish  laura yeah thats true  marisha i dont see any difference in raishan being able to kill us in our sleep here or there  liam she could stay in the shittiest room in the mansion scanlan  sam shes not getting in the mansion she can go sit in the fucking snow and go to sleep for all i /none/ care  matt im very confused right now  sam oh  liam do the thing  laughter  laura its only ten minutes now its only ten fucking minutes  sam the whole shebang or just what we said right now just what we just said right now just that great  taliesin no wait might as well test the waters  sam okay yeah good nine minutes and counting  matt okay hang on whoa i need some clarification here the hammer slams down onto  the stonework  taliesin shut the door lock it this is not /none/ how i wanted this to go down but apparently this is  how its happening wait a minute your boy is gone by now right we sent him out  laura hes gone  matt laughs no you guys were teaching him about the guns when she came back  liam you never know when its out of character or in character  matt mind you he seems largely confused and doesnt seem to know whats going on  taliesin im going to go take the boy for a stroll and show him how this is going to work and /none/  explain to him everything gentlemen you actually plan how were going to kill dragons excuse me  give me strength  liam all right quickly kima we need to talk to you about something very important and if it  doesnt go well scanlan is going to erase your memory but  matt excuse me  sam i can do crazy things  matt no nobodys doing that to me  liam of course not because you are so cool cool as a cucumber were in a bit of a predicament we  are going to draconia so that /none/ you can fight not one but two dragons heres the thing one of the  dragons is here right now is coming with us in disguise  matt immediately the maul gets grabbed she says here  laura no i think youre doing it wrong scanlan  liam weve got eight more minutes  laura no we dont  sam lady kima we in order to kill one dragon are entering into a deal with another  liam before we kill it  matt are you crazy  travis i know thats what i said  laura pure stupidity  /none/ matt obviously yes  travis hear him out  sam if we do this it could help us kill the dragon that killed tiberius  matt and you think you can trust this dragon  all no  matt come on guys  travis all right look the dragon is actually poisoned by a curse shes very weak  matt great perfect  travis we plan to take advantage of that  matt why dont we kill the dragon here and then kill the other dragon there  laura shell fuck up whitestone itll give us away we have to /none/ get away from the city  sam lady kima youre looking at a group of idiots who have felled dragons killed beholders  negotiated with sphinxes gone to other realms and other planes and somehow managed to get out of it  more or less alive  matt you are a lucky bunch of sonsofbitches that ill give to you  liam you know what also this is like  laura im keeping an eye on the time  matt she leans on her hammer  liam this is what this is like this is just like the underdark with /none/ one exception we worked with  that fucking asshole thinking he might have some redeeming qualities and he didnt he turned on  us right  matt yeah and who told you that who told you that was going to happen who at the very first  moment you showed him to me said this guy is going to try and kill you  liam but on the side he helped us get as far as he did but then he got shot through the head but  thats water under the bridge this time we know that were dealing /none/ with a fucking piece of  shit were going to turn on the piece of shit and kill her the whole plan is to get them all to  turn on each other and then we mop up the messy bits afterwards  taliesin seven minutes  liam one dragon or two dragons you want to play lets play  sam or you can let us go into this without you and probably all die  matt yeah youre all going to die  travis oh  liam you were ready to run with us girl  matt oh im /none/ coming with you because im not going to let you die  sam oh you are  matt god stupid bunch of gits i swear bahamut are you serious scoffs this is  ridiculous im not going to tell anyone you made this plan until its done because this is  stupid as shit  sam it could be but with you by our side it has a slightly better chance of going correct  matt yes it does  liam kimmy can you be cool  matt please dont call me that  sam lil kim  liam can /none/ you be cool  matt wheres the dragon  laura its in draconia  taliesin six minutes  matt what about the one thats here  laura its hiding  matt hiding  liam its going to show up after the fact in draconia  matt so this whole deal you just dont trust me enough to tell me where the dragons sleeping in  our place right now youre all acting very weird  travis we made a deal  sam its for your own protection we cant tell you everything  laura what if you go running off /none/ what if you go try to kill it in here and whitestone gets  destroyed  matt please  laura its a temptation believe me we know  matt it is very tempting trust me yes it is but im also not stupid  sam after all weve been through  liam weve all almost died a hundred times  sam were asking you to trust us blindly in this scenario and i know that its not ideal but we  have saved you before  marisha and kima please remember between me and you of all people before we /none/ trusted the  illithid we trusted you  laura well we trusted her  marisha youre right i didnt trust you  matt i was about to say  marisha they trusted you i didnt im getting to my point but we grew past that and now i  trust you more implicitly than most people in this world  matt good  taliesin this is precisely why you people need me  liam i think all these words are fucking it up she seems down i think we should just get it on  laura heres the thing though /none/ you have to pretend like you dont know its super  important  liam right can you be cool  matt youre asking me to lie  laura well pretend  matt im not real good at lying  travis how about you just dont say anything  matt that i can do  laura okay perfect and dont attack  taliesin four minutes  sam should i wipe her memory  travis and laura no  sam might be easier at this point  travis no were good  matt you come near me with any sort of magic /none/ mumbojumbo im going to clock you in the head scanlan  sam lady kima i dont know what youre talking about  matt i love you but im going to clock you in the head if you try and wipe my memory little gnome  liam kima weve got three minutes left kima  matt until what  laura he can choose any ten minutes he wants really  liam thats true you know our mind you know what our plan is youre kind of a firebrand do  you think it might be better for you not to know /none/ you know now but to not know going in and then  you kill everything on sight when were there  matt i have no idea what youre talking about and this is really starting to frustrate me are  we going to kill a dragon  laura and travis yes  matt were going to kill two dragons  liam one to two dragons yes  matt great okay whats the plan  travis we leave tonight  laura we go  sam we go where the dragon is were going to release bait when the dragon is done /none/ with the  bait we go in and kill the dragon  travis yep pretty much  liam and then another dragon  sam maybe a third after that  laura if were totally weak though we cant fight the second dragon right away we have to  save up our strength and then fight her after so we dont die  matt im not going to lie i admire your drive and gusto just be smart about this  taliesin look at that she says she cant lie and there she did it so well  sam i thought /none/ you were gone  taliesin im listening in to this whole thing through the earphone as im talking thats how i  keep telling you how long you have because im laughing so much  matt all right well then  marisha im going to go talk to the sun tree  sam i thought we were going were leaving now  marisha just gather your shit ill meet you there  sam where  taliesin and marisha the sun tree  liam shes our ticket there  laura dont talk to anyone kima  matt if were leaving soon /none/ im sticking with you guys  taliesin im going to let asum in on our plan  liam hey scanlan could you wipe kynans memory please  sam kynan  liam yeah hes here  sam kynan didnt really hear anything  taliesin no i left with him  liam you left with him  taliesin i havent been in the room because i took him away  liam i redact that statement excellent  laura yeah thats why percy left  liam i see i was focused on the fire  taliesin oh no ive walked kynan to show /none/ him how i would like things to function  matt yeah and as youre listening in you gave him all the instruction and he takes it in pretty  well jarett catches up with you and you both coordinate with that all right you head to the  sun tree while the rest of you gather the rest of your materials and supplies  laura im going to well if we have time im going to attune my coldsnap armor to me so ill  probably not have my bracers attuned  matt okay so thats two damage off any /dung/ of your ranged attacks so keep note of that  laura but i get what cold resistance and added ac or something  taliesin im going to attune animus and drop the gloves of missile snaring for this fight  liam free wet willies  matt as you attune the weapon theres a brief familiar dark glow on the weapon and all the  three names that exist on the barrel all dissipate its now a clean barrel  laura oh no  taliesin well all right well have to have a talk about that is it all right if /none/ i let asum  know what our basic plan is  sam what that were leaving now  taliesin were leaving now well be heading there the fight will be tomorrow there will be a  creature that we will lure and bait the white dragon with we will attack at the end we expect  to see her participation if we are not acutely aware of it all deals are off  liam sounds good to me  taliesin i relay that information  matt okay do you go to asums room  taliesin i knock  matt you /none/ knock on the door  taliesin asum  matt a voice goes shushes you hear lowered voices from the other side of the door for a  moment  taliesin i walk away assuming that asum will know where to find me  travis thats it  taliesin i go back to gathering my things pulling powder and shot out of what was necessary  matt okay about ten minutes go by and as youre gathering things asum approaches im sorry  percy i was indisposed  taliesin i apologize i hope i didnt disrupt anything important  matt no /none/ i was keen enough to cover but both the cinder king and the frigid doom are under the  impression that there is no mounting danger  taliesin tonight we go to draconia  matt very well  taliesin tomorrow we fight the dragon we will bait him with another creature of great strength  matt might i ask what creature of great strength you intend to bait vorugal with  taliesin i dont think anything youve ever heard of before  matt try me  taliesin what the hell i pull out the book and show him the picture /none/  sam whispering her  taliesin sorry thank you  laura well its asum right now  liam its confusing man  taliesin yeah theres a lot of gender issues in this  matt reaching into the abyss thats curious  taliesin i figured that quite possibly in private you and i have the closest dispositions  matt i can see that kinship as well  taliesin once that fight has concluded we mop up whatever is left we expect to see your  participation in some form i understand if it cant be direct  matt i can be /none/ of aid i just have to remain inconspicuous i cannot be seen to be part of this  confrontation  taliesin obviously  matt and all shall be fine  taliesin we may have some extra people with us as well  matt this was not discussed who would you intend to bring into this deal  taliesin that sadly i cannot inform although there will be draconians they are disinterested  in our politics  matt and disposable  taliesin i would hope not but i understand your point of view i will say for the sake of this /none/  encounter our point of view will be dominant but i understand and respect yours when dealing with  ants you must respect the needs of ants surely you understand  matt i follow all right  taliesin so there will be that we will have a couple of accompanying members as well but since  youre staying hidden it shouldnt be a problem i would recommend not showing up in this form at  the very least  matt oh in this form i have many forms i can take i have an idea very well fetch me when /none/  youre ready  taliesin we will be leaving on our own you will have to meet us there im sure getting to  draconia shouldnt be too much of a problem for you  matt why not travel with you and your band that seems like a waste of magic  taliesin it does but sadly we are trying to keep our own reality quiet the needs of ants and  also they dont want you around they dont trust you  matt i understand that but if youre going now it takes me at least three four days /none/ of travel  over the ocean to get to draconia  taliesin surely you can find a faster way you got here very quickly you so rarely lie that im  so fascinated that when you do i think im starting to get your tells just a bit of them  matt youre a funny little man  taliesin i take that as the highest compliment  matt well then ill see you tomorrow  taliesin see you tomorrow  matt and asum turns around and exits  taliesin i turn the corner get far enough away and drop to /dung/ my knees and breathe deeply for a  minute  marisha well done  taliesin head to the sun tree  matt all right you guys make your way to the sun tree while youre walking keyleth you head  there as well is there anything you wanted to do before they arrive  marisha yes i wanted to go underneath in our little sun tree cave that we carved out  matt okay so you go beneath the tavern into the basement down into the little tunnel beneath that  leads to the sun trees roots  marisha yeah /none/ and i cast commune with nature  matt okay  marisha laughs theres so much pressure on this is there a way i can put my hand inside the sun tree  taliesin wow  laura yeah  matt its less of a merger and more as you touch and connect to the roots your consciousness and  the sun trees consciousness can combine  laura youre holding the roots  travis dear diary  laura today i talked to the sun tree  marisha dear sun tree  sam it was so turgid  travis turgid  taliesin it /none/ was an appropriate usage of the word very well done very good  matt yeah  marisha okay im going to cast commune with nature and try and connect with the sun tree  matt you grab the roots and feel the warmth flow through your hands and there your consciousness  connects with that of the sun tree and you are both present in that same plant space  marisha sun tree  matt hey keyleth  giggling  matt been a while  marisha hey sun tree  matt hey keyleth  marisha without burning a question can /none/ i personally ask you how are you doing man  matt doing all right  marisha yeah  matt a little cold but whitestone  marisha okay man yeah hey sun tree  matt yeah keyleth  marisha so youre overtop all these arcane leylines across the whole globe right ive  traveled a lot of places here lately what are all the cities that the other arcane ley lines fall across  matt i dont rightly know  marisha can i sense it through the sun trees roots  matt which as he converses with you he says ive /none/ been here a long time dont really get  around much being a tree but you do feel this light fuzzy blue almost like a mist energy  like a particle energy that is coalesced around whitestone and above it and it shoots off in six  different directions some that curl up northwards some that curl out over the ocean and  you see them spider out in places and then go beyond your peripheral the leylines only spider  out past the alabaster sierras you cant see much further than that  marisha are there any cities any /none/ places of interest i can see that weve been through before  where they happen to cross  matt let me look at the specifics of commune with nature real fast  marisha im trying to see if i can use the sun tree to extend my vision a little further  matt unfortunately the spell only lasts for up to three miles  marisha yeah i want to extend a little further  matt you sense that yes these ley energies do travel much further and surround the world and  make a network of various magical pathways but /none/ unfortunately the sun tree and your vision right  now doesnt go far beyond whitestone yeah it isnt a lot  marisha so the ziggurat the spinning orb of death that happens to be right underneath you are  you in touch with what that might be feeding  matt cant say i do  marisha goddamn it sun tree goddamn it  matt keyleth calm down im happy to answer your questions invite you to my space just  because im not an allseeing tree dont be angry with me  marisha im not angry with you sun tree /none/  matt angry in general just chill  marisha thats really easy for you to say sun tree  matt yeah it is  laughter  marisha okay all right sun tree  matt yeah keyleth  marisha youre a tree from pelor yes  matt more or less  marisha have there been the attention of any other gods on whitestone right now that you can  sense or can i sense im asking the sun tree out of humor but can i sense it im assuming the  tree doesnt actually know fucking shit  matt the tree /none/ may know a lot just the right questions need to be asked the sun tree says to  be perfectly honest keyleth even pelors grace left this place hundreds of years ago his  presence is here in bits and pieces but when i was first taking seed the gods were much more  present much easier to read kind of lonely nowadays  marisha thats so sad  matt i know keyleth i know  marisha youve got me sun tree im here you shouldnt be lonely  matt when youre around keyleth nobody can be lonely  marisha /none/ aww thats so aww  laura hes saying that as youre holding on to his roots  matt dont make it weird laura  laura sorry  liam it was weird five minutes ago matt  marisha okay sun tree i dont think i have much time left but is there anything you said youre  lonely i just want to say if you ever want to talk im here you know you can confide in me if  theres anything you want to say im all ears you know  matt i appreciate that  marisha yeah  matt /none/ youve got to come to me  laughter  matt but when you do hell yeah  marisha you know i didnt really get any of the things i was looking for sun tree but i still  feel a little better thank you  matt thats all that matters keyleth  marisha yeah youre cool sun tree  matt youre cool too girl  marisha aww not as cool as you  matt probably  marisha yeah okay im going to be walking through you here in a minute so i wanted to let  you know that theres /none/ going to be eight people going through so dont feel alarmed  matt oh boy  marisha does that hurt you  matt it tingles a little  marisha oh okay  matt thats all right  marisha im sorry im not going to stop doing it but im sorry  matt i appreciate it  marisha all right bye sun tree  matt bye keyleth  laura has anybody seen keyleth  matt as you go up top the whole group is gathered there currently  taliesin shes downstairs with her wood  laura oh did you have fun /none/  liam you seem way more relaxed than even an hour ago  taliesin you smell of pine  laura and sap  liam yep ill have whatever shes having  sam are we ready to do this  laura yeah  marisha sure  sam hey before we go lady kima singing when the gnome hits your eye like a big pizza pie  youve been mindmelded speaking im going to wipe her mind its too risky  taliesin of what  sam of the whole conversation its too risky  taliesin thats a lot of mind  sam /none/ nope its a tenminute conversation  liam ten minutes when he wants it  matt all right whats your spell dc on this  sam 21  matt well you didnt have your hand cone out though when you did it  sam oh youre going to bust me on that 19 then  laughter  matt kimas eyes blink for a second  didnt i warn you scanlan shorthalt  not to try and wipe my mind  sam yelps  matt shes taking a hit natural 20  gasps  matt right there okay  sam nervous laugh /none/ this is how i die  taliesin im okay with this  marisha i was feeling relaxed  matt you take 35 points of damage 27 of it blunt damage from the actual impact with the hammer the  rest of its thunder damage as her holy thunder maul slams into the side of your head and sends  you skidding ten feet across the ground coming to a halt  taliesin that felt fair  laura well he deserved it  matt damn right he did  liam well he had good theres a lot at stake  travis /none/ vax let it be  laura how about we get through the tree before we talk anymore  matt i love you guys but  laura yeah  taliesin oh no he had that coming  travis it was a good swing  matt thank you ive been tense recently anyway  liam i pull the gnome up and cast lay on hands and give him ten hit points you all right  buddy  sam groaning you passed the test youre worthy of coming with us on the journey  taliesin we can only apologize for him so much /none/  matt this is true shall we get on with it  travis and taliesin yes  laura were popping in far enough away right in the tree grove up above the chasm  liam there was that sideways tree  matt the sideways tree was where you came through but you found a tree above that you could  get to  marisha and i grew a tree right didnt i grow some trees  matt yeah  marisha i pick one of those trees  matt okay you finish your transport via plants spell the portal opens you /none/ all begin darting  through kima darts through whos the last one out  taliesin ill be the last one out  matt make a perception check  taliesin no 11  matt 11 okay you dart through the portal before it closes you all emerge from the other side the  cold snowy ice hits you there is actually a bit of a snowstorm that is blowing through right now  as you come on the other side immediately the wind chill hits you and it gets extremely cold  it was darker in the day it was starting /none/ to get later in the afternoon here it is night it is  blustery not quite blizzard but definitely a heavy snow decent wind night on the bluff right  outside the ravine that dips down into the remnants of draconia and the small icy throne  that vorugal currently calls home  taliesin lets find a place to hide the mansion and sleep  marisha what time is it here  matt its night you dont know what hour but its black night  marisha i can scry once we get in the mansion  laura can you set /none/ us up  sam sure yeah ill poof the mansion  matt okay  liam also quickly ive attuned whisper and ive changed the deathwalkers ward to cold  laura whats my armor class now that ive put the coldsnap armor on  matt you had armor on before right  laura i did so is it up two points from that  matt the armor was plus two right you have the item card for it then yeah your armor class  would be up by two  all right so you guys enter the mansion kima comes in /none/ looking around well thats pretty  damn swanky  taliesin yeah shut the door  matt shushes  sam i was going to show you to your room  matt no  sam all right well then you can sleep in the fucking living room  matt fine ive slept in worse  sam great servants dont help her  matt i dont need any help she leans up against the side of the foyer wall and starts  taking her armor off shes keeping an eye on scanlan the whole time  laura kima theres extra rooms upstairs  /none/ matt im good here  travis are you hungry at all  matt i actually am pretty hungry yeah  travis ill find food for you i go for the kitchen  matt thank you what else do you guys want to get done in preparation for this  liam do we want to have a heroes feast because of the terror that dragons inflict upon all those who  sam is it prepared  liam what else are we saving it for other than this  sam no i mean she has to prepare it ahead of time  /none/ marisha can i cast it ahead of time sorry can i cast heroes feast at a higher level  matt you can yeah but do you have it prepared  marisha no i brought transport via plants i can do it in the morning  laura but it uses one of your spells is that all right i mean its pretty important  marisha it is pretty important can i do it as a ritual spell  matt i dont think it works that way unless it says its a ritual sorry yeah heroes feast is  not a ritual /none/ so you have to have it prepared  sam you can do it tomorrow morning or not at all  marisha im going to scry  matt okay what are you going to scry  marisha i dont want to necessarily scry on vorugal but can i scry in her  taliesin she has guards we also have the leader of the dragonborn  marisha what do you mean  taliesin we can see where he is right now  marisha instead of spying on vorugal  laura who what  sam wasnt the leader of the dragonborn a female /none/ first of all and wasnt vorugal a male  laura she was vorugals a male  matt tooma is the leader of the theyre not draconians these are the ravenites draconians  were essentially wiped out ravenites currently hold the ravine  laura scry on tooma  marisha i can scry a few times  matt just so youre aware you can only scry on someone on the same plane of existence so youll  have to step outside the mansion to scry  marisha oh ill step outside the mansion to scry  matt okay  marisha i step /none/ outside the mansion and i take a good hard look around  laura ill sit in the door and ill keep an eye on this  matt okay both you guys make perception checks  sam im also going out there with them  travis im in the kitchen  laura natural 20  marisha hey 14  sam ten  matt whats the total on that for you vex  laura 33  matt okay for what distance that you can see there is no light visible down in the ravine it  is pitchblack darkness you can see /none/ around you there are the trees that you guys came through a  couple of other barren broken trees that have been long dead or at least leafless for a while  slowly curling over the edge of the ravine the land has eroded over time and theyve slowly begun  to move with it you dont see anything else in the immediate vicinity it is freezing cold  though youre doing okay because of your armor youre a little chilly and youre shaking  naturally from the wind chill as youre preparing the ritual you begin to focus on /none/ the scrying who  are you scrying on currently  marisha first im going to scry on tooma  matt all right as the cold begins to hit the tips of your fingers begin to go numb you finish  the ritual your eyes glaze over white and your vision projects itself into the darkness in front  of you it rushes down like a sudden drop of a roller coaster into the bottom of the ravine and  is rushed to the side inside the warm interior of the wall on the western end of the ravine  darting /town/ through a number of familiar tunnels you find yourself back to the small village that was  built by the ravenites through the central circular opening where the small fountain was and  youre thrust into the tent where you first met tooma there you see upon the throne is tooma with  four guards around currently draped over and asleep slowly snoring as her head droops  marisha whats going on around her do people seem to be preparing for a battle  matt you cant really tell you only have focus on her you see very fuzzy things /none/ theres not a  lot of action around that you can tell  marisah im going to do it again  matt the scry finishes your fingers are now getting more cold  marisha i take the cloak and wrap it around as much as i can  matt putting your flame hands to warm yourself up a bit  marisha now im going to scry on that outside entrance to vorugals lair  matt well vorugals lair is in the open of the ravine its a little ways up  larua yeah remember its that raised ice platform  /none/ matt where you guys are up on top it goes down into the ravine and the ravine curls through and  splits off in different directions in the center of where a section of the ravine forks off in the  center there is that cluster of ice with all the spikes off it on top of the rubble of one of the  central islands of draconia thats where vorugal is currently living  marisha okay because we were in there earlier so can i scry on the location not trying to focus  necessarily on vorugal  taliesin /none/ there will be guards at the guard stations all around the outside  matt generally a particular creature you can choose from i can let you scry on the location  but ill have to make you roll for it  laura i think thats dangerous  marisha scrying on the dragon or the location or both  laura both anything near vorugal i feel like its dangerous  marisha not knowing could be more dangerous  laura plus thordak has those scrying balls within the location  marisha did vorugal have any other allies do you remember some of /none/ the guards  taliesin just the guards and its not really allies at all everybody will turn the moment it looks  marisha all right i abandon the campaign and go back inside  matt okay anything else you guys wish to do to prepare for the evening before the morning comes  sam oh im going to try to load the gun  matt okay make a dexterity check add your dexterity modifier to a d20 roll  sam 16  matt 16 you take a moment and take one of the pistols the little barrel clicks out and /none/ you go  oh you take  taliesin thats your dex save not your dex modifier  sam oh thank you 11  matt 11 youve seen percy load a bunch so you go and take this small bit of powder put it in  put the bullet inside it slides in and it seems fine  sam okay thats it holstered  matt all right anything else guys  taliesin i have to sleep it off i feel terrible so im just going to sleep  marisha where exactly are we going to do we have a plan on /none/ dropping this beast  taliesin were going to tell tooma to tell the dragon that theyve found something to kill and  take him out into the wastelands where were going to release it  marisha should we go try and talk to tooma now  taliesin we could send i would say vax  laura i think scanlan polymorphed something very teeny  sam whats going on are we going to go talk to tooma  laura and let her know the plan of releasing  travis if you leave the safety of the mansion you have the chance /none/ of being ambushed at any time  by a fucking dragon  sam can we all go as a group tomorrow no  laura no we cant wander on down into vorugals territory  sam how far are we from tooma  taliesin very close  laura thats why i said if you polymorph into a teeny flying bug  marisha fly there i can polymorph you  liam you can be invisible as well and im very sneaky  sam you could fly  laura dragons see a lot a lot  liam well the dragon would know if /none/ i was really a mouse or not though as well  sam were not going near the dragon were going to see tooma  laura pretty close to the dragon  marisha yeah in the same area  matt maybe a half to quartermile away from the entrance to toomas area  liam got that dust of tracelessness  sam we could fly in as little birds or something stay low in the ravines out of sight  liam i dont know how to unpolymorph myself one of us has to talk and youll do the talking yeah  marisha /none/ i can drop polymorph as long as you guys keep me in contact with the earpieces  sam well be out of range  marisha then i dont know  liam hit us with the dust of tracelessness you turn invisible well hoof it  sam sure  liam yeah  travis all of us  taliesin no just them if they run into a problem  liam were shit out of luck  marisha are the earpieces going to stay in range  liam not in a quartermile  laura be safe this is dangerous  sam all right /none/  matt they dont work from within the mansion to outside the mansion its a different plane of  existence technically  marisha then im going to go minxie form my white snowtiger and i will stay within earshot  range so that way if anything goes bad i can alert the rest of the group  laura how are you going to stay in earshot  marisha earpieces  laura just from the top of the cavern  marisha ill follow as close as i can  liam with dust of tracelessness  taliesin should be fine  liam /none/ hit us grog  marisha lets go without having some sort of  travis you know the dust of tracelessness you sprinkle behind you  matt yeah it gets rid of tracks makes you harder to track  laura i can cast past without a trace on you  sam i can make us both invisible so well be plenty stealthy  travis and real quick weve got to tell tooma that were coming you dont think if we start  attacking her dragon shell be like oh its those fucks from two weeks ago  taliesin were not attacking /none/ the dragon  laura thats true if we bust out the thing and then  sam no but they need their people all ready to attack  liam we want them to know to stay clear to not attack this thing if they can help it  sam also they might be able to tell us where we should release the beast  marisha yeah they would know theyve been tracking down animals for it to hunt for a while  liam its a worthwhile risk  marisha they have to tell him where to find it  matt youre /none/ going there right now  liam yeah gather up you scanlan here  laura i dont know if pass without a trace works if im not near you  marisha i think you have to cast it on yourself  sam well be invisible itll be fine were the best in the business we walked around here  completely without any stealth protection last time we did fine and we didnt even know  anything about the culture or the people  laura yeah but there was no dragon last time  marisha i can enhance one of yalls abilities /none/ so you have advantage on rolls for a stat i can do  that to one of you  sam maybe you should enhance my stealth ability  marisha thats what i was thinking im going to cast enhance ability and thats a dex ability  the cats grace or whatever it was cats grace on scanlan im going to turn into minxie  liam can i do the same does that stuff stack or no i could cast bless do the same thing help  with saves and  matt yeah  liam all right i bless the three /none/ of us  sam oh thanks i will give us both invisibility level three invisibility  matt okay both of you go invisible you turn minxie what are you doing  marisha im going to stealth as far behind them as i can  matt you guys are all stealthing along the top of the ravine  sam yeah the top of the ravine in the ravine right  matt how are you getting down  sam oh oh its steep  matt its a cliff its the grand canyon  liam i shoot out the wings and i glide /none/ scanlan and i invisibly down to the bottom  matt okay you guys disappear down into the ravine you lose eye contact with them once  theyre outside of 120 feet of you  marisha ill stalk the top of the ravine and keep an ear open  matt okay  marisha and keep an eye out for anything that looks horrifying and bad  matt okay make a  sam horrifying check  matt make a perception check  sam who us her everyone  matt either of you  sam 16  liam perception you said 22  /dung/ matt 22 all right you glide down and it takes you a moment but you do over the next 30 minutes  or so it takes you to finally find the area thats familiar to you in this dark that is where you  guys previously were youre having to look around for quite a bit and its a lot of having to go  back up again and glide around its a big space and in the dark in the middle of the night its  very difficult for you to figure out any sign of where you previously /none/ tread you do manage to find  it but youre now looking at how long does invisibility last  sam one hour  matt okay so you guys are about halfway through invisibilitys functionality  liam and halfway through flying  matt marisha make a survival wilderness check  laura i want to sit on the door  matt a stoop  marisha what do i use just nature  matt this is wisdom survival  marisha 15  matt okay best you can you begin to follow the edge of the ravine and try and do your best  /town/ remembering the path of the ravine based on where you were previously and taking in what sort of  outcroppings and structures were familiar to you you think you may have found over time something  near the entrance youre not sure best you can do right now  you guys eventually find the entrance where you were led in by the rest of the ravenites you zip  through and it begins to open up into the subterranean town if you will it is very quiet  there are a few walking appear to be sentries haphazardly armed and /none/ armored but it  seems like the majority of those here are sleeping  liam whatever we do we dont want to scare the shit out of everybody and get attacked  sam no should we become visible or wait until we get right up next to tooma and then become  visible  liam i think we go visible now  sam all right okay yes lets do it ill drop invisibility  matt both of you guys appear do you begin to walk toward the central  sam yeah so is anyone awake  liam no we just /none/ hear quiet underground  matt its a quiet underground tunnel with a bunch of huts and tents and small abodes that are  all silent there are two wandering sentries that are armored as soon as you begin walking through  they both turn and look and see you  sam hi hello  matt spears out  sam its fine yes were friends of tooma weve come to parlay  matt put your weapons down  sam i have no weapons i play fiddles  matt i see a sword at your side  sam would you like me /none/ to drop it to the floor  matt yes  sam all right well im already being asked to take off my belt  matt you too  liam all right  sam were friends of tooma we have an important mission  matt persuasion check  sam 22  matt draconic words the other guard walks off theres an awkward threeminute beat where hes  staring at both of you intently with the spear out eventually the other guard comes back and  talks back to him in a language you dont understand draconic words  sam oh yeah /town/ we dont speak this  laura i shouldve gone i really shouldve gone  matt it is a strange hour to drop by but tooma will see you leave your weapons where they lay  liam youre going to take good care of them youre going to leave them there  matt they will stay where they lay  liam all right  matt come with us both of them stand behind you guys spears to your back and nudge you to  continue forward you make your way to toomas tent the four guards inside are there with their /none/  spears at the ready two of them have shields and theyre not an aggressive stance but definitely  alert and making sure that youre aware by their physicality that theyre paying attention to you  and are ready to deal with anything you bring  across the way theres a small fire in the center of the room a small fire pit that is largely  burned out now to small embers the smell of smoke and sage is very prominent and strong in the  room tooma you can see is now cupping a small goblet made of /none/ simple wood you see steam rising  off of it and shes sipping  liam ill leave this up to you mr reynolds  sam lady tooma sorry to wake you out of your slumber  matt it is a very strange hour  sam well where we come from its a totally different time weve come to complete our promise  to you the fact that we are here should give you at least some confidence that we are men of our words  matt aye it was close  sam as a show of good faith could you /none/ please instruct your guards to go get our weapons and  bring them close to us not for any use we just want them close by  matt you are not among enemies your weapons will stay where they are while we speak  sam we really would like them close to us  matt then you should leave  sam all right then well leave and the dragon will torment your people forever  matt that is your choice  liam we came with a whole fucking plan do you want to hear about it  matt i would /none/ love to hear about it but i do not talk to people who stumble into my home before the  sun rises with weapons and arms at their side  sam we are not trying to have weapons by our side we want them close at hand i dont trust  them with people i dont know  matt they will not be touched everyone is sleeping foolish gnome  liam we came to report and well get out of here all right  sam heres the plan well be quick so you can get back to sleep tomorrow morning /none/ were going  to release a beast that will we hope lure the dragon out of its lair we want you and your  people at the ready to attack can that be done  matt that can be done yes  sam and where would you recommend we release this beast  matt her eyes curl up with a slight slick sound of older notasmoisturized lizard eyes you see  these eyelids click across as she thinks across to the northern side of the ravine the ramp leads  up up that ramp you will see a circle of /town/ stones a hundred feet across that should suffice  sam insight check  matt make it  sam 16  matt 16  sam i get a whisper who will talk about loot crate  liam man so many good things about loot crate  travis its a horror theme this month you guys friday the 13th halloween nightmare on elm  street texas chainsaw massacre  taliesin im a halloween fan myself  sam is there any particular time that the dragon would be hungry for a hunt  matt the dragon is always hungry for a hunt its /none/ hungry now im sure  sam and once this hunt happens and hopefully weakens the dragon will you be ready to pounce  matt we will be ready  sam all right how do we get word to you that were in position  matt well be ready  sam okay anything else  liam the thing were going to release is gnarly so give it a little bit of space  matt i will tell my men  liam all right good chat scanlan want to head back to the pad  sam unless youd like to talk about /town/ anything else tonight  matt please leave me  sam not a morning person evening person  liam hey lets go get our shit and get out of here  sam all right  liam i grab him by the scruff of the neck and start pulling him out of the room  matt you guys leave the tent make your way back your weapons are right where you dropped them  sam hyperventilating  liam im so sorry simon i should never have left you in there love you  matt you make your way out toward where the /none/ cavern opens into the ravine itself the snow is  still a good foot and a half up now up the ravine what do you guys do  liam how long has it been since i bamfed out the wings an hour  matt id say its getting pretty close youre not quite sure of the exact time  liam start going up toward the ridge  sam i hope this doesnt make us fall  matt all right you take the wind the cold wind hitting the wings even though theyre an  extension of the armor you feel /none/ this twinge of cold hit you thankfully you have your resistance  up so its helping with that  sam one more invisibility for both of us  matt all right  laura thats important  matt thank you for noting that  liam this is intense  travis laughing his hand was like all right  matt all right you guys invisibly coast up through the ravine  travis did you hear the garment of the reaper as he walked past you  laughter  travis thank you for noting that  matt making your way up onto the /none/ top of the cliffside into a soft bank of snow keyleth  you do hear the soft impact of several footfalls maybe 40 feet to the left of you you look over to  see an indentation in the snow  marisha i start pacing that way assuming its them  matt you guys watch minxie emerge from the darkness and snow  marisha meows  sam hi random cat who is definitely supposed to be part of this landscape lets go  marisha i got this form from being in the mountains of my hometown so yes  matt /none/ you hear nonsense meowing  laughter  sam can we ride  liam yeah can we get a lift  sam i can probably im little  matt you both could ride minxie  liam youre massive arent you  marisha they can ride me im that big  matt i mean not full but they could both be on your back and youd be like strained noises  you could carry them along  marisha strained noises back hurts come on  matt you eventually bring them back to the outside of the door with vex waiting for you /none/ on  the stoop you guys make your way into the warm interior of scanlans mansion where kima is  currently dearmored and snoring leaning against the foyer wall you guys prepare yourselves for an  evenings rest for tomorrow you battle one possibly two dragons  and thats where were going to leave the session for tonight well be back here next week for  whatever this chaos is going to be  sam are you ready to rumble  matt weve got yenk the goristro coming in versus vorugal the frigid doom versus raishan the  diseased deceiver /none/  laura the diseased  matt the diseased deceiver  marisha the diseased deceiver well im going to write that down  taliesin nothing is going to go wrong everything is great  travis and we set ourselves up for it  sam i think weve got a really solid plan  liam two massive enemies  taliesin and an army  sam also theres a really good chance that i wont be able to summon that thing and then well  have to improvise  laura oh god i didnt think about that  matt dont roll low dont /none/ roll low sam please dont roll low that would be so bad  sam or so great  matt or so great  marisha can i use enhance ability to help him out with his spellcasting  sam the thing has a dc a very high dc  matt youre probably pretty good because you have a high enough charisma for you enhance ability  lets see  laura can you inspire yourself when youre casting a spell  sam i dont know can i  matt let me look at the rules for this it should say on the /none/ scroll what do you have to roll  sam i didnt bring any of my stuff tonight  matt actually enhance ability might help with that it does give advantage on checks to the  specific ability which would be charisma so it would be eagles splendor you would get advantage  on charisma checks  sam eagles splendor  marisha yeah theyve got fancy names for each one like cats grace eagles splendor  matt so in theory that could help well define it more ill look at the scroll i wrote up look  at the rule make /none/ sure we confirm that before next episode but yes that is probably a possibility  and if this is an ability check you could also inspire yourself with a d12  marisha honey badger spock is that what you just said  matt anyway start thinking how youre going to handle this next week guys youve got a week to  pull this together  marisha yeah we can talk this time  liam sure were in the mansion  matt yeah you guys are having a whole night where you can work this out  taliesin yeah and im /none/ annoyed that i know what that perception check was about and that percy  doesnt know it really annoys me  matt you dont know  taliesin yeah i do  matt anyway guys well done great game tonight thank you guys for watching well be back here  next week on thursday is it thursday yet  music
