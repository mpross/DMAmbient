jump in to tonights episode of  critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back you guys are /town/ getting sloppy welcome back last we left off our gathering of  friends have been traversing northward along the amber road with the distant destination of  zadash one of the larger cities of the dwendalian empire as your destination upon traveling you  passed a caravan spent an evening amongst trees where you found a wayward cluster of wandering  buffalolike creatures you continued northward for a second day rushed on past sunset to rest in  the city of alfield a small farming town thats along the way to zadash however upon noticing  that some of the /town/ buildings in the eastern side of town began to light up with flame you began to  approach rather rapidly seeing members of the city citizens fleeing and screaming and there  seemed to be some sort of attack upon going into the town you realized that a number of these  buildings are being set fire by an incursion of gnolls you were immediately brought in by  watchmaster bryce who offered to pay you for each set of gnoll ears that were brought to them and  you jumped into the fray managed to kill quite a few /tavern/ many of them still left with their quarry it  seems which happened to be quite a number of bodies andor citizens still living that were  dragged off into the ashen and cloudcovered night upon returning many of you bruised  beaten and at one point in danger of worse you were given an evenings rest at the feed and mead  tavern and were told if you were interested in pursuing future coin in helping with the current  conflict nearing the city to meet bryce out by the broad barn  all the broad barn  laura /none/ thats why i wrote broad barn down  matt that is why  liam i wrote rod barn  matt thats a different place entirely you guys all bundled up into a singular room above the  floor of the feed and mead found yourselves exhausted passed out and got an evenings rest  so youve all gotten a long rest youve healed up youve recovered your abilities as the  uncomfortable warmth of the morning kicks in with your small room and number of warm bodies  encompassing a very tight and not very drafty space the partially humid /none/ early hours draw you  from consciousness you all begin to stretch your sore muscles and decide what endeavors await you  with the new day what do you guys want to do  laura what do you guys want to do today  travis that bed was not my favorite  laura i liked it  travis little stiff  marisha you should try sleeping on the floor its actually really good support  taliesin its good for your back its really true  travis you use a pillow or are you just on the floor  taliesin pillow /none/  laughter  travis do you have to pray over your swords or anything this morning  taliesin no everythings fine they just do what they need to do i just have to keep them clean  travis yeah well we were sharing a room one night and molly has a ritual i think its part  of his custom yeah he performs over his swords  taliesin i have to take care of them or else theyll stop working of course  marisha sure  laura do they need to feed  taliesin they do actually yeah ive got /town/ to feed them some well its complicated i dont like  to go too deep into it but ive got to use my bloodline on occasion actually since were  already on the road i should be honest i wasnt entirely telling the truth when i talked to you  that night  travis no stop it  sam you seem so honest  taliesin oh youre just a bundle of truth too arent you  liam what is a bloodline  taliesin i suppose its only fair i did tell you that these swords are special and that they /none/ use  the blood of my family to activate themselves i know i might have said i was from a long line of  priests and  marisha oh my god you killed your whole family  taliesin i didnt kill my whole family  marisha oh okay never mind keep going im sorry  taliesin our family were less the priests and more the sacrifices we may have stolen the swords  and run thats why ive been trying to keep a bit of a low profile when it comes to some of the authorities  travis yeah i /none/ mean for fear of your life you ran  taliesin its been a long time but id rather not run into them  laura what gods were you being sacrificed to  taliesin oh i couldnt tell you it was my parents i was just wee by the time that happened  sam is there a roving band of priests that are trying to find you right now  taliesin oh i hope not i mean its been a long time  marisha wheres home where is this place that you stole  taliesin my parents never spoke of it /none/ somewhere out east  liam you got to the circus from that how  taliesin well it was a bit of a mess but i just ended up there eventually just looking for a  place where i could rest i suppose  liam thats funny you gave me an answer but you didnt really give me an answer  taliesin well i dont know you that well  marisha thats what hes been doing this whole time  taliesin that requires a drink  travis i understand that sentiment trying to find a little respite a little peace  /none/ taliesin its a good place to be if you want to run but not run  sam are there any others of your family out there on the run  taliesin not that ive ever met  laura was it just your parents and you that were being sacrificed  taliesin you know i dont know i never thought to ask  laura did they want to kill you or just take your blood  taliesin apparently they needed us alive for it so there was that  laura oh so it wasnt so bad they just slowly drained you /none/  sam doesnt sound that bad yeah theyre not going to kill you  taliesin so i was told  marisha isnt that what youre doing to yourself on a daily basis  taliesin its not that bad though it doesnt leave a mark really  travis youre in control of it youre using it for yourself  taliesin oh yes of course it can come in handy  laura does it have to be your blood  taliesin oh yes of our bloodline apparently  marisha have you tried any other bloodlines  taliesin well ive cut a lot /town/ of people with them would you like to take a run at it you could be lucky  marisha ill save that for another day  taliesin i had a funny feeling  travis im tempted  sam what about you fjord are you going to vomit any seawater this morning  travis retching  sam oh watch out  travis nah  taliesin couldve been worth five copper on the open road at one point  travis i seem to have missed my calling  taliesin always could use a circus geek  marisha howd you sleep aside from /town/ the crappy bed  travis i know what youre asking i didnt have any other dreams it was fairly restful  laura no dreams at all  travis none i care to speak of  liam do we think theres anything left of this town  taliesin that is a question  travis anything left  sam it didnt seem like the whole thing was on fire  travis we couldnt quite see it at night thats true maybe we should go down  liam i would like to take a walk and see what it is were out to /none/ save  laura we can steal some things  liam maybe we do that second and first we take a walk  taliesin how do we get paid there was talk of pay  laura i thought we already got paid  liam we did but molly was drinking so maybe he does not remember  travis he said he was going to bring the rest i think later  taliesin ive got to say theres worse ways to make a living  liam i counted 60 gold  travis hey molly didnt you say bryce said it would come /none/ later  matt bryce had said if you wanted to continue to help with this then there was more money  laura lets keep helping  marisha yeah i mean its not a bad gig  laura we could stay here forever and just kill gnolls  sam that was very scary one of them almost killed me  laura but think about how good we would get over time  sam thats true the 10000hour rule  laura mmhmm  taliesin nott the gnoll killer  travis jester we agreed not to put anyone in harms way in an /none/ excessive manner  laura when did we agree that  travis did we not  liam i dont remember that either  taliesin i dont recall making that arrangement  laura did we agree to that  travis maybe i thought that was an unspoken thing  laura usually when you agree to something you have to say it out loud most of the time unless  its like we just agreed to it you said it you said it  sam what did you agree to  laura i cant tell its a secret oh but shes serious about /town/ it i can tell  taliesin youre so good at this  liam well my social anxiety is getting the best of me im taking a walk goodbye  matt the door slams behind caleb briskly making his exit  laura do you want a donut this morning its a little more stale in the bag i have to let you know  travis i think im fine  laura do you want one  taliesin oh yeah more donut for us  marisha i guess we should greet the town  travis fair enough  laura wait when did /town/ we say we were going to meet bryce  sam why are you yelling  laura i thought they were leaving  travis actually i think theyll find us  marisha yeah maybe we could just stand in the middle of town and go bryce until they show up  laura in front of broad barn  marisha okay i have a question about this broad barn thing is broad barn the name of an  establishment or is broad barn a very broad barn  taliesin its a very long barn  marisha its a very big barn  /town/ laura what if its a street we didnt clarify did we  marisha what if its a tavern i dont know i got confused in his delivery  laura i bet we can ask the guy downstairs  marisha all right yeah  taliesin he seemed nice last night  travis we go downstairs  taliesin ill follow for this  liam its a zork game we go down the stairs  matt i know apparently you head downstairs to the only other real location within the feed and  mead tavern theres crute still there off to the side /none/ and one very dirty and ashy civilian who is  currently slowly scarfing a meal with a thousand yard stare looks like they had been close to the  action and chaos the evening before as you walk down crute looks across and goes i see youre  awake would you like breakfast  laura and taliesin yes please  matt all right itll be about an hour because its just me  sam an hour all right  matt its just me  laura do you want some help ill come help you  matt come on  taliesin /none/ ill go in for this if it means a faster breakfast  matt the two of you jump in with crute in what is a not very wellkept kitchen but functional the  gristle who knows how long its been there it might add to the flavor who knows  travis arating for the city of los angeles  matt well put it at a b in panorama city  taliesin wow thats an injoke  matt you guys go ahead and help out it does manage to cut down the time for breakfast  preparation eventually food is presented /none/  laura after weve cooked im going to switch out his salt for his sugar  matt make a sleight of hand check  taliesin i want to see if i see this i dont do i  matt youre too caught up in the mealmaking  laura 19  taliesin oh yeah i definitely dont see this  matt neither does crute as you manage to do so swiftly practiced like youve done this before  in many other establishments in the past maybe  laura after we cooked  travis you just give us all diabetes thats great /town/  taliesin the frittatas are going to taste real weird  matt as you guys finish your breakfast the rest of the day is yours  marisha what does the town look like when we step out front how bad is it  matt as you emerge from the tavern and caleb youve already seen this you see that the fires  have now been reduced to maybe a dozen wide plumes of graywhite smoke on the eastern side of the  city it rises from the ashes and charred wood remains and wood frames where some buildings used  /town/ to be it seemed much more dangerous and chaotic last evening but looking at it now in the day  its no more than maybe a dozen buildings or so that were affected they were more centralized to  cause the most chaos suddenly at that time of night you get the sense as soon as you look  around that the folks of the city are on edge understandably so you see the people are trying  to pick up their lives and move on in the face of what recently occurred the very air holds this  tension /town/ as you look around you people walk past you with sacks of grain and tools their eyes  wide darting around for unseen danger and glancing past the two tieflings immediately  instinctually step back a bit and make a wide berth you watch children run from doorway to  doorway trying to stay out of the street as long as possible it seems like its trying to carry  on but its going to be a process some folks are rummaging through the remains of the respective  buildings you glance over near where the central portion of your /tavern/ conflict last night took place  where the candleglow tavern is and there you see amongst the smoldering rubble of the inn a single  halfling man sifts through the wreckage a crownsguard helping him lift heavier beams you  see as he plucks what he can of his former life from the rubble  sam should we go over and talk to him  laura sure  sam do we recognize this person  matt you have not met this person no  laura youre a halfling too so maybe you should talk to him  sam im not /none/ technically  taliesin im going to walk over  sam ill join well just go over and scare the shit out of him  taliesin need a hand  matt you can see a halfling man maybe in his fifth decade or so he has ashy blond hair and a  face cracked by smiling though now too dour and sootcovered to see any sort of smile on his face  as he pulls through some of the rubble and hes making a small pile on the side he looks up and  goes oh right can i help you /none/  taliesin we were part of this commotion last night we were wondering if you need a hand with  anything right now  matt i mean if you dont  taliesin im taking off my jacket  matt you dont have to okay okay as you dive in you spend the next ten minutes helping move  through some of the heavier beams that collapsed there is still somewhat of a structure mainly of  the bottom floor but a lot of the top floor the one that you were in last night has fallen in  over time /none/ so its moving some of the bigger beams out of the way as youre pulling through and  moving some of the larger pieces of the structure the halfling man goes i appreciate the help  names thadeus thadeus candleglow  laura oh this was your place  matt it was  laura oh wow  matt 20 years since i was left this place built by my grandpaps reedus  sam were you here when the attack happened  matt oh i was here when they all came in i was gone i wasnt about to stay around you /none/ know  sam did you happen to see where they came from  matt oh i did not i was in the process of cleaning dishes and dealing with a couple of my  patrons one of them and he points over to the rubble you can see what looks to be a skeletal  body thats been partially collapsed i suppose leimans probably not going to be a regular anymore  laura oh no  taliesin you going to rebuild give him a fine plaque  matt rebuilding requires something called money i think im probably going to gather /none/ what i can  here and shop up north and see what other  work i can get myself to  laura how much gold do you need  matt i dont know a building establishment like this im not entirely certain but i could check  in i assume its probably a few thousand gold pieces for the structure  laura i just had that too im sorry i dont have it anymore but i could try writing to my mom  to see if shell help you  matt thats really sweet  taliesin or as another thought /none/ since you were basically robbed who were they what happened  has this happened before  matt oh this hasnt happened as long as ive been here and ive been here most of my life  here in alfield you hear about these things wandering on the outside and you know crownsguard  keeps you safe anything comes too close they just shoot them in the face with a bunch of arrows  and shit  laura i love him so much  sam thadeus did they seem to be after anything in particular were they here for property or /none/  people or gold or food  matt they didnt take any of the worthwhile stuff thankfully he points over to a pile and  you can see theres some brass urn or vase thats been smashed and dented by the conflict you can  see bits and pieces of a few keepsakes that might be worth a little bit of money that have been  brought out they just mainly took all of our food stores most of my meats most of my salted  meats the dried meats the fresh meats the butchered meats they cleared out the /town/ butcher down  the street  laura shrimp scampi butterfly shrimp  travis coconut shrimp  laura fried shrimp  sam dont engage them  taliesin were all going to die now  matt thats a real curiouslooking face you got there  liam excuse me i saw in the middle of the fray sir excuse me  sam in halfling i say to him ive also been a victim of a horrible attack  matt make a persuasion check  sam oh minus ten  matt but in halfling that helped yeah sorry what can i do  liam /town/ im sorry i was part of the fray as well i was right in the thick of it i saw a cart piled  high with bodies are there people missing from town  matt quite a few youd have to ask around some of the crownsguard  liam how has the rest of the village fared is everything as poorly off as you are  matt i mean plenty of folks seem to get through this okay they only took down a few buildings  im more worried about the folks that were plucked from their homes  liam /town/ is yours the only business that was hit  matt i havent looked around to be perfectly honest ive been a little focused on and he  gestures out with his hands at the rubble that was once his life  taliesin you had a lot of meat didnt you  matt well you have to present meat a lot of people around here eat meat  taliesin would you say that you offer a larger selection of meat than some of the other  establishments in town  matt if youre asking me then the best meat dont know /none/ about quantity but quality was tongue click  taliesin i feel like ive been robbed of the experience of your fine fine meat products and  i for one would like you to rebuild so that i might try some of your meats  matt well if at some point the gracious gods see fit to bequeath upon me a strike of good luck  and i can get to rebuilding my friend one day you may be able to try one of my meats  taliesin im going to take a look is the friend whos dead skeletonized  /town/ matt oh yeah burnt charred  taliesin oh burnt okay where is this butcher that you mentioned as well  matt oh thats he steps out through where the doorframe is still standing the one that you  defended yourself through most of that battle just a freestanding frame now  marisha was i in the butchers because that would be some real horrorlevel shit  taliesin i think you were in the barbecue shack  marisha thats kind of awesome  matt he points over to a building across the way which is one of the buildings that was /tavern/ nearby he  says that theres the ruddy top butcher well what remains of it and you can see that building  too its still standing and its nowhere near as damaged as the candleglow inn but its sustained  quite a bit of damage and it looks like the roof has fallen in  liam im sorry mollymauk another question for you is there maybe i hope it is still  standing but a supply store  matt yeah if youre looking for farming supplies general supplies theres  liam im sorry im in the need of some incense /none/  matt oh you could probably find something like that there the broad barn  laura oh its a store  marisha question answered im sorry im standing by fjord question answered  taliesin its like half a question because youre wondering why its called that at this point  laura i bet its big  taliesin at least wide  matt at one time it was a barn but the farm stopped giving up crop and so they converted the  barn itself into what was a general store because they started selling off the tools they didnt  /none/ need but that made them more money than the crops did that year so we started importing more tools  and for the past 30 years the broad barn has been our commonly known general supply place there on  the western side of alfield so if you want to  sam this is really fascinating  laura wow this is a really good talk that weve had  matt of course  travis did you just outtalk jester  laura i think im going to go look for the broad barn  taliesin thats an idea dont pack up /none/ shop just yet were going to see if we can do something  about these terrible creatures that have been roaming around  laura maybe well find all of those thousands of gold for you and you can build your shop back up  matt well yall look like youre geared up to be making a mess you going after these things  taliesin we are perhaps persons of action  laura were really tough we have no fear  matt he leans in real close to you getting on his tippy toes to meet your gaze and he says /none/  well if you manage to go and kill some of them dog people you tell them thadeus candleglow says hi  laura i will  matt thank you  taliesin she really will  matt good  laura here its a moldy donut be well child the traveler is with you  matt im not a child but i appreciate the gesture  laura you know my name i leave  matt gesture her names gesture  taliesin it is a gesture like prince  matt the adventurer formerly known as jester he takes a bite and spitting  /none/ liam also im sorry just between you and me i know the look on your face a little bit you seem  a little manic if you have friends you can stay with right now you know you dont have to rebuild  it today i recommend you take it slow  matt i dont think i have much of a choice at the moment he gives a long stare towards you  that fades past a little bit beyond anyway i should get back to picking up the pieces excuse  me and starts gathering more stuff from the /none/ rubble and the crownsguard behind goes over and  takes the things hes already gathered and begins putting them into a small crate and doesnt engage  marisha while they were having that conversation im hanging back with fjord if youre cool with that  travis yeah  marisha question if you were a crazy ravenous dog humanoid person thing what would make you  really hungry all of a sudden i didnt phrase that question very well  travis no i knew where you were going with it though how do we ring the dinner bells is what  /none/ youre saying how do we get them to come to us  marisha yeah it seems like theyre into meat kind of anything  travis well they done took it all i think  marisha also theyre really hungry more so now  travis why more so now  marisha i dont know why more so now  travis well they took all the lubys cafeteria with them so i dont think theyre going to be  hungry for a bit  marisha but what if they are still hungry  travis then we would need to roast some meats /none/  marisha you know who else was really hungry out of fucking nowhere  travis who  marisha big angry toad man devil toad guy i feel like i should get better names for all these things  travis yeah he was hungry all of a sudden  marisha i dont know i mean it might be a coincidence  travis you thinking some of them gnolls had some fiendish qualities perhaps  marisha well considering some of them were undead  travis right shit  marisha there was that whole zombie gnoll thing  travis i forgot all about /none/ that  marisha yeah how could you forget that  travis i have some weird dreams what did you have in mind other nights  marisha and travis what  laughter  marisha i legitimately didnt understand what you said  travis oh nothing i got shit in my teeth  marisha are you okay  travis yeah fine did you have a plan did you want to do something to wrangle them  marisha i was just striking conversation  travis oh sorry well maybe well follow them to the barn broad  marisha okay lets go to the /town/ barn broad  travis broad barn i was fucking with you  marisha i was going along with you  travis yeah thats all right  taliesin when did we hire tom stoppard to write this  matt i know seriously  taliesin i couldnt deal  matt where are you guys off to  liam to the broad barn  matt you were told it was on the western edge of town and since most of the city is built on two  intersections of main road you follow the core essential east to west path and on the /town/ way out  where you first entered last night even though you just ran past it you can see there is indeed  right on the edge of town almost like the town was built to fill the gap in between a very large  barn that looks to have hundreds and hundreds of feet of coiled rope on the outside the front doors are  wide open and you can see a number of folks are coming in and out many of them with cleaning  supplies heavy pieces of cloth buckets whatever can be used to start getting /dung/ rid of the remaining  black splash and ashy covering of last nights destruction you also notice as you approach on  the outside theres a bit of commotion you see a dozen or so crownsguard and a handful of armed  volunteers that all appear to be in regular civvy farmer clothing that are all gathered in a loose  huddle with bryce among them you hear a loud grating voice from within that huddle as you  approach from the outskirts you see a middleaged male gnome of ruddy complexion and slicked parted  dark hair he wears /none/ very clean maroon and gold robes and that would lend an air of elegance  were he not hopping around and pointing fingers you see as he starts shouting between the crew  waving his hand around without any warning it was your job bryce with ruben cold dead that  leaves no lawmaster to preside forcing me to take that position as well i do not need that added  responsibility but until we get a new lawmaster instated from rexxentrum i have no choice bryce  pipes up at this point glancing over and seeing you guys presence /none/ starosta ive sent a request  to both zadash and bladegarden for a supplementary force but it may be weeks before any would  arrive can we send trained hands at my approval to retaliate at which point the starosta which  has now been identified says we cannot spare any of our forces while the surviving guard are drawn so  thin out of the question maintain a vigilant perimeter and deflect any further incursions  bryce nods slowly can we at least have permission to hire mercenary strength to  retaliate then i feel not being proactive before /town/ the gnoll force can fully regroup would put us at a  severe disadvant at which point is cut off by the starosta yes thats fine hire outside i  dont want any more of my citizens deaths on my record dismissed  he immediately pushes through the crownsguard and storms off which is hilarious to  watch a gnome storm out of a group of people and off with a huff is escorted by three crownsguard  from behind out of that space the crowd begins to murmur and disperse and go about their  business bryce turns and /dung/ smiles at all of you theyve washed up from last nights damage and  dirty conflict so as they approach  marisha i turn to jester and i go look inviting look heroic  matt im deeply sorry about that starosta kosh is highstrung on a holiday and tensions have  never been this high since he was assigned here eight years ago so please dont take that to  heart hes just a  laura dick  matt your words not mine  travis seems some people handle pressure better than others he doesnt seem like the handling type /none/  matt no those in higher political positions rarely do it seems anyway i want to thank you  all again for your aid last night i cant fathom the further death toll had you not been there and  jumped in selflessly as you did thank you bryce trails off and looks back towards where starosta  kosh had stormed off and goes fucking dwendalian political bullshit weve needed a more trained  guard here for weeks especially with xhorhas bleeding into the valley but were far too south  to matter any request has been declined due to /none/ all necessary forces being needed at the garrisons  by brokenveil if they were doing their jobs at the bluffs we wouldnt have so many reports of  violent beasts in the valley in the first place but here we are at least ive gotten approval for  a bit more cash to that while i do not know what your business here is in alfield if you are still  interested we are in need of some skilled mercenary work  laura were going to kill all of them  travis we couldnt help but overhear that you were /none/ asking for some aid how long were you  thinking you might need these replacements  matt well until at least this threat has been dealt with in a satisfactory way ive  unfortunately not had my scouts return after they were sent the night before which does not  bode well but i suspect that we should see some sort of hopeful backup sent by zadash or  bladegarden within the next week or two in the meantime were a bit of a sitting duck scenario so ive  sent a few guards to go to zadash to see /town/ what other mercenaries could be sent forward we do  have some folks traveling along the road and will keep an eye out to see if anybody else is looking  for some coin but for now you are our first line of defense or offense if you will  travis well i think i speak for all of us were certainly up to the task for a bit well maybe  for a little less than a bit can i ask are there any other threats to this town besides those gnolls  matt oh there are plenty of /none/ threats lets see famine syphilis  travis things that come on legs and with weapons i mean  laura syphilis can come with legs  taliesin i feel like that was worth pointing out  travis why do both of you know that  matt youre not wrong  taliesin tiefling thing  matt this backwards place has its fair share of issues as ive come to learn as being not from  the region but it seems to me that nothing on this scale has quite assaulted in some time i  mean there have been wandering rumors of /none/ terrible things and creatures wandering past the xhorhas  border for as long as the dwendalian empire has been around its the whole reason that the  garrisons up north but this far south generally the guard can keep things at bay this is a very  organized thing i dont like it i dont like it at all  taliesin its new then  matt well this is new nothing on this scale  taliesin it seems from what weve seen that they were hungry  matt ive done a bit of research overnight and it seems that gnolls /none/ are known to be very  aggressively hungry creatures could say famished to the point of obsession  laura i feel their pain  taliesin i can understand that  liam so you wish to hire us how much we are very experienced but wed like to know what were  talking about in advance what kind of money are we talking about  matt the deal stands 30 gold per gnoll ear proof of a dead gnoll if you can recover any of  the missing townsfolk here in alfield and bring them back safely id be willing to /none/ pay 25 gold a  head returned  sam what if we find a dead body and bring it back  liam is there some lesser number for those  matt there is because even if they are gone we would wish to bury those weve lost i could  probably muster ten gold per retrieved member of the alfield citizenry  laura specifically their heads too  matt preferably all of them whatever you can find  liam it is permissible is what theyre saying here  matt seeing what these creatures did last night i dont know what /town/ state youll find any of  them but im being hopeful  travis do you know what area they might have gone to  matt they seemed to be heading east to a northeast direction thats where the scouts went  before they left i wish i had more information for you but that may be the place to start  liam could you tell us at least what the landscape is like in that direction what is over there  matt there are some spotty woods on the outskirts of the town that alfield was built  into beyond /none/ that its rolling hills and fields there are some older long grownover settlements  that have been abandoned smallscale but honestly beyond here its mainly fields  laura i bet we can find some ghosts  taliesin i always love a ruin  matt if i might offer some advice if you do see a ghost dont engage  laura do you know where they are so we know how to steer clear  matt my dear there are ghosts everywhere in this world its far more ancient than you assume  laura ooh  marisha bryce some of these /dung/ gnolls were undead or raised from the dead do you have any inkling  as to why or have you seen that problem around here before  matt i dont know as to why but its not uncommon from what i could ascertain whatever  dark powers they worship it seems allows some to progress beyond death rumors are that when gnolls  go hungry and left to feed on each other what remains rises to fight alongside those that still live  laura that would be why some of them have chunks missing out of them  liam this /none/ comes from research you have done that you have read up on would you be able to share  this reading with me so that we are fully prepared  matt honestly i just shared with you most of all that i had learned  liam just a small book  travis more of a pamphlet actually  matt the only other bit of information i was able to pull from that was they have this thing  this entity that they worship it has a name pulls out a few small notes  laura fire hydrant  sam does /none/ it start with an a sometimes if you go down through the alphabet a b  matt as youre saying this they pull a small series of notes from their pocket yeenoghu  sam with a y that would have taken forever  matt let that be a lesson young halfling  liam with a y yeenogru  all yeenoghu  matt i dont know how to pronounce it i only read it i apologize  taliesin do i know anything about yeenoghu  matt make a religion check with advantage  taliesin a religion check 18  matt it /none/ sparks a memory in you information floods your mind and you recall hearing about  various demonic leaders of the abyss creatures that once walked the prime plane you see images  of this large bestial feral angry demon everhungering ever wandering to conquer and  devour in its wake leaving destruction fetid meat and waves of yipping angry hyenas to devour  what was left behind  taliesin thank you  liam sorry another question may i call you bryce  matt of course  liam bryce we were just about to go inside the barn here and get /town/ outfitted for this for many  things but especially now that we are going to go take care of this problem do you have any sort of  pull with these people might we get any friendly  travis advance  liam no well sure but im talking about some sort of discount for getting ready for the road  were not that flush  matt its not so much about that more than these arent welltodo people in their own right  and right now honestly rebuilding  liam its asking a bit much i was too forward  /none/ matt thats all right but you as i know quite well from personal experience have some coin to  your name perhaps that will be of aid to you  liam yes  taliesin one last quick question though what do the gnolls normally eat  matt as far as i could tell whatever living things they can get their hands on  taliesin those buffalo creatures that we see roaming around  matt probably  taliesin good to know  matt i will say if there are any surviving captives then haste is very much key for if they /town/  are as hungry as they seem regardless of the massive volume they have acquired through the  evening i know not how many their number is or how hungry they are take too long there may not  be much left to find  laura well get this stuff and head right out  liam sorry my curiosity gets the best of me always you are talking about buff buffaro  creatures or something we saw these beasts on the outskirts of town they look brownfurred  beast of burdentype creature do you know what those animals are  /town/ matt right yes the valley aurochs  liam valley aurochs got it thank you all right we should get ready for the road walking  into the store  laura was it hit at all was the store that were going into destroyed at all  matt no this was far enough west it was mainly just a few buildings in the eastern side coming  from where the woods were it seemed like they were using cover of tree and canopy upon the  incursion then immediately assaulted partway into the eastern part of the city burned it from /none/ the  middle and then used the flames to escape out the back what were you about to say  marisha gasps bryce  travis and marisha exaggerated coughing  matt yes are you all right  marisha sorry a lot on my mind speaking of the aurochs i asked you yesterday if youd heard if any of the  farmers had had their cattle hit you heard that yet  matt i could ask around it does happen on occasion  marisha its fine well ask on our way out its good  travis hey caleb  liam yeah /none/  matt if youll excuse me i do have something to get to but good luck and godspeed  laura have fun dealing with the dick  matt ill do my best bryce turns around and leaves  laura did i recognize starosta kosh did he seem like the type that would have made a little side  trip down to because he seems like the type  travis was that a characterdm inside joke  marisha i know i feel like i learned something  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin im filing im putting a wall between /none/ that  sam i cant read your dice at all  laura intelligence 18  matt the robe coloring is what caught you and the hair the specific slicked and parted comb  you have seen this individual before you were younger maybe eight or so years ago eight or  nine years  laura good to know  taliesin youre just made of secrets arent you just made of secrets  travis caleb  liam yeah  travis in my personal holdings i dont really remember putting this there but apparently i  have five sticks of incense that /none/ i have no intention of using  liam oh yeah  travis will that do you any good  liam well that would be worth about how much dm  matt what does this incense come from  travis i think it was part of a thing i dont know  liam a pack or something  travis its dd beyond i dont know  matt oh so its part of an adventuring pack then  travis i think so yes  matt it would be negligible by comparison id say maybe at most five silvers worth at most  /none/ liam that is really very  travis changed your day didnt it everythings coming up flowers now  liam yes this has helped me immeasurably  travis dont mention it  laura wait wait how much incense do you need  liam well it depends on how much i want to do with it i want my cat back but i was in the  realm of 15 or 20 gold im going to spend here today if they have that much  laura on incense and that five sticks was five silvers worth  liam did anyone say that /none/ out loud  sam she has a good eye for value  laura that is a lot of incense to burn  matt well theres a lot of parts to  liam its not quantity it is the quality of the incense and this was topshelf but i still  need more so in we go and then i say thank you big guy and i punch him and i walk in  travis as he walks away im like ow  laughter  matt i think both of you do that as you both separate  liam keep up /none/ a good face for two seconds  matt as you walk into broad barn there are five other individuals that are coming through and  picking up thick cloth for cleaning one person is picking up a few different burn balm kits on the  far end as theyre checking out there is an extremely old gentleman with this giant gnarled  tuft of a chin beard that merges with this halo like a lions mane of white hair he has this  really thin long crooked nose almost like engywook from neverending story but no glasses  hes trying /dung/ to keep a smile in the rather dark faces of the people that are coming in with the  evenings events coming around as you guys walk in and approach he glances down and goes well  if yall need something yall just let me know  sam oh boy west virginia  laura do you have any pickles  matt yall want pickles  laura you seem like the type of place that would carry pickles  matt he leans back and rummages through what sounds like a small paper bag  laura they come in barrels usually you /none/ get barrels of pickles  matt theres a small glass mason jar with two pickles and he goes im willing to part with  these here pickles  laura is it poop in a jar or is it pickles  matt no its pickles it looks like he may have just pulled it out of his lunch  travis only you would put poop in a jar jester  laura thats true  matt i could part with them for around three copper  laura that is a good deal sir and i will give you the copper  taliesin /none/ do you need more copper are you all right  laura no hold on no ive got copper around somewhere  taliesin okay because ill give you two copper if i get one of those pickles  laura okay here i pick some lint off one of the coppers that i have  matt he takes the copper from you  taliesin i pass him the two copper  matt he takes the copper from you slides forward the pickles and goes laughs good deal  liam excuse me i just inhaled my own spit  matt dont do that /none/ that is not conducive to a lengthy lifetime  liam speak n spell voice i am okay as caleb i am needing a very fine kind of incense and i  dont know if that is the type of thing this establishment would carry but its very  important do you have that sort of thing  matt you want incense thats fancy  liam im sorry its very noisy in the shop what did you say  matt its really fancy them incense  liam well look at me can you not tell how fancy i am  matt /town/ thats why im curious  liam well you know ive been on the road a long time and im carrying a smell with me if you  cannot tell  matt i got incense  liam to the point i like it i would like to spend about 20 gold worth of incense do you have  that much i dont mean cheap shit  matt what kind of establishment do you take me for  liam well its a barn ja  matt touché he wanders away from there and gathers any semblance of anything that could be  /none/ considered incense to some degree its a massive volume its when he said quality over quantity  this is definitely a quantity circumstance two big burlap sacks filled with all sorts of fine ground  herbs and things that could amount to  liam i would like to make an insight check to make sure its not oregano  matt go for it  liam come on wheres the druid thats what would be for oregano thats vex this one  laura but she would know if you were swindling  liam perception  matt no thatll be insight  /none/ liam insight oh thats much better that is an elf  travis and laura a what  matt an elf  liam elf 11 you just learned something everybody its 11 in german  matt he seems to be doing the best he can  liam good this is really good i will give you 17 gold for all this  matt deal  liam one two continues counting  sam while hes counting this out is there anyone else in the store anyone at all  matt at this point theres three other people in the store and theyre /none/ slowly filtering out  sam do i see any little trinkets or anything little brass things little baby bottles anything  matt it seems that most everything they have here a lot of them are basic farming supplies  there are a few metallic joints that could be used for when youre tapping a keg they have some keg  taps there they have oh my god  laura youre such a dick  liam 16  sam oh that one fell  liam 16 and i push the 16 gold forward  matt slamming i appreciate your patronage  /none/ liam these are heavy  taliesin i know this may be a stretch but do you have maybe any healing potions or anything like  that or maybe this might be weird some kind of poisons maybe  matt thats pretty weird im going to say there sir i mean you look pretty weird thats a  pretty weird request no we do not carry poisons  taliesin for dealing with pests on a farm that sort of thing  matt we have insecticides  taliesin think that will work on a gnoll  travis yeah insecticide pesticide herbicide  /none/ marisha an insecticide generally refers to insects and were talking gnolls  laura but its usually poison you put  travis yeah but you ever chugged a bunch of insecticide thats a bad day  taliesin stuff is stuff its bad for anybody i guess  liam is it flammable do i know if its flammable  marisha and taliesin how much is it  matt for about a vial that big a silver  marisha youre going to have to use a lot  taliesin what would that really if i were to drink that right now what do /none/ you think that would  do to me  matt probably have some real serious shits for a few days  travis its like visine  taliesin wow really  sam may i examine it  matt yeah  sam okay im going to look at it smell it look at the fluid do i know anything about this  chemical at all  matt you do its a very diluted form of acute poison to the point where it wouldnt actually  affect any larger creature but if put in a large batch of water used to spray down /none/ crops certain  insects what are they called again i forget aphids things like that would die off  sam aphids oh thats nothing it wont really do much  taliesin do you know about these sorts of things  sam sometimes not a lot  taliesin thats very impressive  liam nott youre selling yourself short  sam speaking of and ill ask him for the components to make acid does he have that stuff  matt yeah in a very anarchist cookbook kind of way he doesnt sell you acid but there are the  materials available where /none/ you could create it  sam okay how much for all this shit  laughter  matt how many vials worth are you looking for  sam just one  matt just one this will run you about 12 gold  sam all right thats fine  laura oh can you throw a med kit in there with it if you have any left  matt he looks around im afraid were clear out bit of a   laura you have things going on  matt lot of things sorry  laura its fine  matt my apologies  /dung/ laura no its okay i have this pickle  matt its a good pickle  taliesin it was  marisha is it a good pickle though  laura i havent tried it i just drank the juice but he ate it  taliesin i ate mine it was quite good now were just sharing the juice at this point  marisha guys lets go kill gnolls  travis just the juice  taliesin juice is great  travis it is with a little whiskey  matt groans  marisha and laura picklebacks  matt brine drinkers  marisha nom nom /none/ nom  travis like cheeseburger in a shot glass  marisha yeah so good  matt ugh stop it  laura are we prepared now to go  sam wait no  liam no i have things to do  sam do you sell any healing potions  taliesin i asked that  sam you asked that already  taliesin yeah i did ask that  sam oh never mind  matt were not really purveyors of healing potions and those that have are usually held by  the crownsguard  taliesin wait the crownsguard really  laura we didnt /none/ ask bryce for any healing potions  taliesin we should ask bryce for some healing potions  matt you actually asked the night before and bryce had said that theyre currently being used  to tend to the people that were in really bad places its hard to walk through a war zone and  be like hey guys do you have supplies  travis what do you need to do for the rest of the day caleb  liam well i would really like to get my cat back so i would need about an hour to go do /none/ a  little stuff do you have anything else to do  laura i mean there are people getting chopped up and eaten but if you really want a cat  liam what are we doing are we taking our cart  taliesin take the cart and get some meat from the butcher  laura we might be able to go faster  travis i think if we were a little spread it would help  liam well okay maybe i can put it on hold although i really hate to but lets come up with  what are we /none/ doing what is the plan  travis well i would follow the direction they left last night see if we can find a trail  sam were just going to go into the belly of the beast because one of them shot me and killed me  with an arrow we could draw them out  travis yeah you just stay behind caleb youll be fine  laura you didnt die nott i saved you  sam thank you so much but i dont want to be in that predicament again can we draw them out somehow  travis yeah /none/  sam they are fond of meat heres my idea we stage a barbecue contest finest in the land all  the best barbecue will be there and then when they come to sample our wares i run and you kill them  travis you know i love that idea small thing though time again is of the essence  sam because you want to slow cook that stuff to be really good its true  travis right dry aged really get a good hickory chip under them problem is people might be dying  in the meantime so if /town/ we could find a more expedient solution  liam oh so were you thinking of having a barbecue here or setting up a barbecue on the road  laura im think in the middle of a field yes so that its  liam just a random field  laura yeah  taliesin itll take a while to make the signage alone  laura so it seems like less of a trap  travis beau had an idea get them beau you tell her  marisha no you take it for her please  travis beau had a fantastic observation if /none/ we happen to see one of those beasts of burden on  our way out tracking maybe we could wrangle one up and use it as a bait  laura and if we dont see one then fjord youre the biggest  taliesin thats fair  liam either way we will probably need the cart  taliesin we could also see what they still have at the butchers  travis to bring people back  laura and bring people back  sam and maybe one extra horse  marisha what did you say molly  taliesin or we could see /none/ what else they still have at the butchers theres a butcher  marisha well the butcher got severely cleaned out  taliesin well we just heard that he might  travis i think youre right extra horse we need the cart  liam to carry one of those beasts if we kill one  marisha if we can try and figure out a way to set up our operation on the edge of the forest so  that were not in the middle of a field in the open  liam well is the point to try to im sorry /town/ no you finish your thought  marisha hills are bad to fight in unless youre on top of the hill thats good  liam im not a tactician but i have a question  marisha go ahead  liam are we trying to go back to these things where they live their lair their home their camp or are  we hoping to luck into them on the road or  travis i think wed be making a best guess at this point my best hope is to find out where they are  what it looks like where theyre /none/ staying and if we can without confrontation get some survivors  out of there that would be ideal  liam i like that idea as well  marisha actually thats not a bad idea at all maybe we could have like a survivor round up team  and a defense team  laura but then how do we get all of the ears  travis im just putting it out there maybe survivors before ears  marisha we can always go back out and get more ears whenever we damn feel like it  liam well thats the thing we /none/ can do both but there is a timestamp on the people we should take  care of the people first because then were increasing how much gold we will bring in because  if they die then we will not get as much money for them if they are alive we should get them alive  get them out kill the baddies if we can at the same time and if not go back a second time  travis i thought you said you werent a tactician look at you  sam hes very smart  taliesin extremely tactile  /none/ travis calebs plan lets do it  liam no social graces lets do this  marisha lets go  travis and marisha break  sam are we getting another horse  laura were going to ask bryce if they have a horse to spare  sam why dont you four go get horses me and the cman will go get some incense and stuff  travis cman i thought i was the seaman fucking get your titles right come on brother you know  you want to im a proud son of a bitch  sam sorry youre a seaman /none/  liam wait so now we need time  taliesin were going to go get a horse you dont need to be here for that  liam oh god i really want my cat but maybe  sam lets go get some incense i need to buy some tarts  liam well get the tarts maybe it would be handier as a bird  laura you need a tart  sam i need a tart  laura oh well why didnt you say something hold on let me dig  sam thats a bag of pastries  laura theres this /none/ one  sam wow  laura hold on i think theres a blackberry one somewhere in here  sam ooh i cant tell what this used to be  laura its kind of gross im sorry  sam is that the top or the bottom  laura i cant tell anymore its all black sorry  sam i have two tarts  matt yes very stale  sam im taking them  matt you cant tell if the sour smell is intentional flavor or just time taking its toll  itll be tart one way or the other  travis /town/ do we see any crownsguard around in the street  matt over time you will theyre scattered a bit thin and a lot of them are currently focused on  either perimeter watch in case they come back or helping out those that need help inside the city  travis id just like to find one if i could  matt within ten minutes of wandering through the city as you guys have gathered yourselves and  begun heading towards the eastern side you see a crownsguard who is currently walking by with some  washrags under one arm and /none/ a little streak of dried blood down the side of their face looks to  be a young man probably in his mid20s or so longish hair thats been heavily braided on the  sides and then pinned to the back in a tuft of a ponytail  travis howdy  matt yes  travis sorry to bother but weve been commissioned by bryce to make a little expedition  to go after those gnolls and were going to need an extra steed if the crownsguard has one  matt were not allowed to give out any crownsguard supplies if /town/ youre looking for a  steed youd probably have to go to the on the wind stables theyre going to be your best bet  travis where would those be  matt right and points over towards the northern side of the town its one of the  buildings thats taken a little bit of fire damage  travis are you concerned about the people that live in this town clocks ticking on their lives  and you want me to go get a steed from another stable instead of saving their lives  matt its not  travis i /town/ sure would hate to have to report this to bryce i think theyd be pretty upset about it  matt make a deception check  travis 13  matt look i mean no offense whatsoever and if i can go find bryce and see if we the  watchmaster would be much more suited to  travis your name  matt reggie  travis reggie im disappointed reggie i dont know what else to say lets go  laughter  laura should we go to the stables then  travis fuck yeah now  liam reggie this town has been /none/ hit hard you look very weary and maybe a little down on your  luck yourself maybe im just reading into things but i would gladly pay you a silver for this horse  taliesin let me tell you reggie it would be the best deal you could possibly make im going to  use charm person  matt did not make that dc check reggie glances over at you he goes let me see what i can do  and quickly makes his way northward to the outside of the stables  travis very nice  taliesin thank you /none/  matt about five minutes pass and you can hear the clopping of hooves as reggie comes back with a  very obstinate beast on the reins dragging it towards you slowly guiding it reggie doesnt  seem to be a very trained individual when it comes to handling creatures especially beasts of  burden will this do  marisha oh good i see you brought us your best reggie thanks man  taliesin ignore her shes very difficult  matt hands you the reins  taliesin youre a hero thank you  matt best i could do good luck /none/  liam heres that copper thank you  matt thank you  taliesin i hand him a silver also  matt thank you thank you  liam silvers way too little for a horse  taliesin you said silver and were being fair  matt just bring it back its on loan its on loan  taliesin if we come back it comes back  laura probably we definitely wont use it as bait for the gnolls okay bye  travis we make our way over to where we left our other horse and cart  matt okay easy enough /none/ to find you placed it at a hitching post with a little bit of feed over the  evening your cart and horse are safe and at your disposal  marisha i saw them take off into the forest i tracked a little bit right between those trees i  dont know we can start there  laura i bet they left a lot of tracks and probably some cart things  travis i dont know why i thought you were going to say they left behind poop  laura they probably did oh my god they werent wearing any /none/ underwear were they  matt they were wearing cobbledtogether or scavenged bits of leather and hide armors  laura but did it have holes for their butts  matt it seemed like most of them would have had some means of disposing of their excrement  liam they dont care theyre swinging low and leaving it behind  matt they werent very welldressed  travis if thats the direction you saw them head off in check it out  marisha ill be on the lookout for cart tracks  liam as we go and also we didnt have time so /none/ here off you go i will sit in the cart and go blind  matt okay while you are sending frumpkin to keep a watch you are keeping an eye out  for tracks make a survival check please  marisha its not my strongest but its okay  laura im keeping an eye out for poop  marisha 16 no wait i rolled a natural 16 so 19 i thought it was a 13 i apologize  matt very quickly you come upon a number of gnoll footprints in the ground seem to be multiple cart  tracks that /none/ was the one that you saw  laura gasps oh no  marisha wait are there nearby towns are there other nearby villages  matt there were multiple carts  marisha oh we only saw one  liam the last one  marisha okay can i get like an odd estimate of maybe how many gnolls we might be dealing with  based on the amount of tracks  matt with that roll id say you surmise somewhere in the neighborhood of about 18 or so  gnolls from what you can gather on the tracks that you found  /none/ taliesin would my hunters bane be useful for that for tracking these creatures  matt you can attempt to glean information  taliesin since they technically have some undead around them  matt for the specific sure go ahead and make a survival check to see if you can even find those tracks  taliesin just a standard one standard survival check all right  matt well technically youre tracking undead so you get advantage on this one  taliesin 17  matt same degree you find the tracks you see there is the remnants of this gnoll horde  /none/ returning towards a similar direction you find three sets of cart tracks  marisha i turn to the rest of the group and i go good news were real stupid if we thought we  couldnt track them because theres a fuckton of them thatll be easy bad news is oh god  theres a fuckton of them thats it  travis yeah that is bad news are the carts all heading in the same direction or would they split up  matt they all converge into one path they head through the relatively thin woods that surround  the /none/ northeastern side of alfield as you progress on that path out to the other side of the woods  continue into the northeastern fields where the rolling hills begin these hills seem to go on for miles  liam frumpkin would be in the air 300400 feet in front of the cart and i wouldnt do 100 of the  time but i would talk for three minutes and then maybe go hold on one sec magic sound effect and then  come back so intermittent  matt go ahead and make a perception check  travis tall grass on /town/ these rolling hills  marisha or is it just open fucking hills  travis picked by beasts or  matt no no its tall grass across the hills  liam seven  matt the grass can vary anywhere from kneehigh to chesthigh in places the hills towards the  top can get a little more rocky there are patches where the grass doesnt grow as well and theres  open dirt and broken shale after about an hour or so of tracking in that direction you come upon the  rillway road which is the main road that heads up /none/ towards felderwin you can see it a little ways off  liam also in this time i would have told the rest of the group before nott and i arrived in  trostenwald just outside the city limits we were waylaid by gnolls previously and they were hiding  in grass just like this it was very much like this so we should be im getting very nervous  right now looking at it all  taliesin in theory am i actively tracking these creatures the undead at least  matt the undead tracks are falling in line with her /none/ tracking theyre moving as a group but there  are far less undead tracks than there are regular gnolls so as best you can to keep tabs on it  taliesin im curious how much of this hunters bane i can actually be using right now  matt youd be leading if she hadnt made an equally good roll so now both of you are leading this  travis the grass is it dead or vibrant green  matt vibrant green for the most part the wind is picking up a little bit and you can see  especially when /none/ you start coming up over some of the bigger hills you can see the waves cresting over  the hillside and causing the shift of it its a very beautiful space  travis is it still the morning hour or about midday  matt at this point now youve been travelling well say an hour and a half its getting close  to noon  travis high noon  matt yes  liam you know i know its actually about 1137 so were not quite there yet by the position of  the sun  travis oh no dont do /town/ it oh no  nervous laughter  taliesin hes sorry  travis it was right there  matt i know anyway  liam beholder  matt dont think im not tempted  marisha how rough and how open is our situation right now are we in the middle of an open field  matt youre pretty much in the middle of an open field but the tracks you can see because you  can see the rillway road south of you and the tracks begin to shift further north as they were  heading back they were keeping off the /town/ road best they can as well you also do notice that within  the tracks you do find bits of grass that are spattered with drying blood you dont know how  fresh it is go ahead and make a perception check  marisha remember how i was like this is the worst situation to be in  travis mmhmm  marisha i feel like this might be the worst situation to be in  travis right  marisha survival  matt perception  marisha perception oh no did you see that  laura its a one  marisha one /town/  matt as youre having this conversation with fjord youre just not paying attention to the  road in front of you  marisha god  laura if were sitting in the cart is the grass taller than us or is it way lower than us  matt no its about as tall as the cart at times at times its lower you guys do stand out amongst  the grass as you head over the hills or down below you are above the grass line without an issue  liam walking on the ground as a human is it /none/ up to here or  matt yeah its about up to your chest at times waist to chest it varies  laura if i stand up in the cart as we go can i see out into the grass  matt yeah if you wanted  marisha what if i gave jester a ride on my shoulders while we walked  sam on a moving cart  matt what could possibly go wrong  liam youve seen teen wolf ja  marisha in the cart and im holding you itd be kind of cool  matt ill allow it go /none/ ahead and make a perception check jester  liam here goes all jesters teeth  laura 19  matt make a strength check  marisha okay like a saving throw or just a check  matt just a check  liam come on roll a 20 make it happen  marisha thats okay its a 14  matt right as your eyes catch something you drop for a second but beaus beneath you groans just  barely holding you the elbows start to buckle a bit but rallies and groans holds you up above  you flatten your back out /none/ and give a graceful pose as you look ahead  laura im flying im flying jack  marisha strained yeah you are  travis king of the world  matt as you guys are coming up over a hill you get a good view down and you can see between the  tall grass and the high weeds that are beginning to cluster this vicinity there is a series of  large hills that all break down into this valley where the grass just ends in this area it looks  like its barren rock and dirt you notice with /town/ that perception check a few carts a few broken  boxes some tables or contraptions theres some semblance of civilization here amongst these hills  off the road  laura gasps theres carts i see the carts i jump up and down in her hands  marisha oh god grunts  sam are there people in the carts  matt she drops you  laura oh are there people in the carts can i see  matt they appear to be empty  laura theyre empty  sam abandoned  laura maybe  sam im going to start drinking  /none/ marisha jester im going to put you down  matt okay how much do you drink  sam im going to take three big swigs  matt okay good to know  liam i would like to use frumpkin to do a oncearound from above to see if any of those  beasts are on the horizon anywhere for us to kill and also if there are any survivors or anything here  matt perception check for frumpkin  liam that is a 13  matt 13 good to know  laura should we pull the cart over and sneak /none/ up  travis yes by foot is how we should proceed  laura okay lets pull the cart over and hide it in the grass  marisha yeah i help jester hide the cart  laura oh but our horses what if they get eaten  sam nervous its all right its fine we dont care about the horses lets just save ourselves  who cares about the horses  laura but how are we going to get all the people back if we dont have horses to pull the cart  sam thats true  liam from 100 feet /none/ up i can see through frumpkins eyes all of us being a bunch of dumb  fucks in the back of the cart  matt its true  sam should we leave someone back to protect the horses  travis no  marisha seems a waste  travis would you want to be the one person that got attacked with the horses by yourself  sam no  travis yeah i didnt think so we stick together  sam all right ill be part of the fjord expedition  laughter and groaning  liam the crew the crew groaned  /none/ laura i heard a groan  sam that wasnt a groan that was like ugh  liam disgust  taliesin that was nausea  matt i feel like i passed a stone  travis yep now im ready to die  laughter  matt all right whats the plan guys  laura im going to does anybody have to sneeze  travis and sam what  laura anybody feel like they need to  taliesin should we  sam sneeze what why  travis that would give away our stealthy approach  sam oh i see  laura because bless /none/ you i give you blessing of the trickster  travis holy shit  liam i was waiting for the punchline  taliesin what does blessing of the trickster do  laura you have advantage on stealth  taliesin i have advantage on smealth thats great  matt smealth  taliesin on smealth he who smealth it  matt mmhmm all right what are you guys doing with the cart and the horses  laura were hiding it in the tall grass  matt okay  travis no rocks around right no stones or boulders in the field  matt not /none/ that big the hills themselves are its just large rolling hills in this whole valley area  travis i was trying to get it in the depression of a rolling hill and just  matt okay you have to back up a bit to get it out of view  liam id like to point out that we came up with a loose plan but were not doing that plan  laura what was our loose plan we didnt see any of them  travis we havent seen anything yet  marisha were not in any tree line or anything /none/  liam also in a pinch we could kill the horses  travis kill the horses oh to use as thats right we could  laura but we wont be able to pull the cart im really strong but i dont know if i can carry  that many people  sam shes lying shes not really strong  laura i am really strong though  sam really  taliesin we wouldnt have to kill the horse we could just send the horse  travis lets find out what we see first and then well decide  taliesin sure recon /none/  laura thats not normally how you test strength  sam i dont know im not strong  marisha lets flank around  travis everybody fan out in a firing line just one straight line  sam were going away from each other  travis just within eye distance right but keep a line  taliesin answered my question i was curious what flanking was  travis keep in line were going to move towards the cart were going to use the tall grass  laura towards the three carts  travis yeah  marisha do we need to have /none/ some sort of awesome whistle or something to communicate with each other  travis im open to it if you have any  marisha oh what was that thing you did in the circus that was cool  whistling  liam spitting noise i cant do that  various whistling noises  liam how about we dont make any noise at all but we just sneak in  travis yeah lets do that  matt having placed the cart where what you assume is the best you can hide it who is helming the  hiding of the cart  /none/ laura me  matt go ahead and make a survival check  liam i will also help with that  matt all right if youre aiding then do it with advantage  liam okay lift with the legs  laura 13  matt okay i mean sure  laura i get some grass and i put it on the cart  sam put your alarm around the cart you do it all the time  liam do we have the time for that right now  sam how long does it take to cast  liam right now it will /none/ take me 11 minutes to do that  laura yeah do it do it  travis peoples lives urgency clock time all that stuff  laura ten minutes okay  sam all right lets just go  matt what is the marching order  liam were coming in as a line together  matt all right whats the order of the line then  travis were all even moving forward  laura but what is the order of the line  sam im to the left of caleb there on the end  liam i dont want to be on /none/ an end i dont want you to be on the end  travis i dont mind being on an end how about that  marisha yeah i imagine that the ends are going to be where you need the most strength right  liam i would grab nott by the shoulder and pull us into the middle somehow  travis you want to be in the middle  liam yes  sam lets walk with molly there boom got it  marisha great  matt all right we have molly nott caleb jester beau then fjord okay i would like /none/ you  all to make a stealth check please as you make your way through the grass  taliesin that helps  sam 21  travis 15  marisha 16  liam 12  taliesin 16  laura ten  liam those monster calves  matt as you guys stay low to the grass pushing through with your hands carefully as you go  hearing the wind occasionally rise and fall with a distant shh the various waves of grass beating  against itself you come upon where the grass begins to fall off you stay low as best you /dung/ can  before the grass itself comes to an end right on the outskirts of where the central area between  these hills begins there as you poke your head through you can see three carts that are  scattered a bit amongst a mineshaft yard the exterior of a mine you can see large wooden pan  tables some pickaxes that are leaning against the side the remnants of some lanterns that have  rusted there are the three carts the carts themselves are spattered with blood you notice  three creatures similar to the gnolls that you saw /none/ the night before but smaller and doglike  these are just basic hyenas that are gathered around and are licking the blood thats soaked  into the wood one of them ends up finding a piece of meat or something that was hanging from one  side and tears it off another one comes over whines and bites onto it and they begin tearing  and fighting over it before one of them pushes the other over and it yelps it goes back and begins  licking the blood off the side of the wood these three hyenas are just /dung/ scavenging on the outskirt  of these carts  sam theyre just hyenas theyre not magical undead hyenas  matt not from what you can tell  travis can we see how many entrances there are to this mine yard  matt from this distance you cant see any entrances  marisha do you think theyre centurions  liam i think theyre going to make a big fucking stink if we  marisha if they see us ill bet theyre the alert system  laura whispers we should kill them  marisha but we have to kill them all at /none/ once  liam that is correct  travis i could make a distraction nott beau are yall fast quick and quiet  sam yes  laura sure  travis who else  sam no just us  taliesin im quietish  travis theres three of them right  marisha yeah  travis all right  marisha you want to try and make a distraction and bring them closer to us then we can jump out  of the grass do the old jump out of the grass  travis about how far from the edge of the grass where we /none/ are to them  matt about 50 or so feet 60 feet  travis can i use minor illusion to create a plump little bunny and have it hop out of the grass but  its front leg looks a little lame  marisha oh buddy  matt quietly this plump wounded with a hint of pink to the fur around the arm where it looks like  it may have been bleeding a bit begins to hobble its way silently out of the grass just beyond the edge  sam im going to hide  laura yeah im going /none/ to hide  matt you guys are still hidden  taliesin im going to draw one of my swords and just out of experiment try and get it to do that  weird thing it did yesterday with my hand  matt you initiate the rite and as you do the blade begins to give a faint radiant glow a  whitishyellow light that you will almost instinctually hold low in the grass to make sure  you dont become a beacon amongst your hiding you watch as one of the hyenas sniffing and begins  making its way the /none/ others look over snarl they begin to gather up and the three almost go  into this pack swoop formation in the direction of the rabbit closing in 40 feet 30 feet 20 feet  with a rapid bolt one of them runs forward and leaps out towards the rabbit and skids into the  dirt past it right to the front of the grassline where you are beau  travis now  marisha slamming  laura i use sacred flame on the one next it  matt okay and who is doing what else  taliesin im going to /none/ stab the third one  matt the three of you rush out and attack three individual ones what are you guys doing  liam i will send frumpkin down to the one that jesters attacking right up against it to  distract and chirp in its face  matt all right beau go ahead and attack first  marisha im going to take the blunt end of the staff and go right for it as it skids by im  going to take right in its neck ooh not great ten  matt ten you go to swing and as /none/ it sees you suddenly it backs away and your staff hits the  dirt right next to it snarls it just barely misses it caleb you following up  liam caleb sends frumpkin right down to the one that jester was attacking and i will send out  a fire bolt at the same time  matt go for it roll your attack roll for the fire bolt  liam thats at advantage if my birdie is bothering him up close  matt right okay wait youre going for the one that jester is attacking  liam yeah the one /none/ that jester is attacking  matt okay go for it  liam that is oh thats good that is 21  matt 21 hits go ahead and roll damage  liam these spells are all still new to me oh thats a big one  matt one point of damage  liam big one point of damage  matt it begins to burn this small circular image on the hyenas body yelping  go ahead and  laura it just has to make a dex save of over 13  matt with a natural one he does not  laura /none/ yay then he gets four more damage radiant  matt thats enough with the blast of the fire bolt and the incineration of the sacred flame  you watch as that hyena bursts into fire and flops to the ground while it burns smouldering its  flesh becoming the meals it had previously feasted upon molly and nott  taliesin ill take my run first thats a wow 17 my brain  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats seven points plus three radiant  matt the first strike just completely cleaves it in half like /none/ its momentum running almost like  it hits the blade and you hold it out and the momentum just carries it over seamlessly carving  through it  taliesin am i close enough to hit the third one thats still left with my second attack  matt you can have movement to close it theres one right in front of beau so youre a little  ways away but you can close the gap while nott and  marisha i didnt get my bonus attack on that guy can i get my bonus attack  matt yep  marisha okay /none/ i want to try and bring my heel down on top of it as it tries to scooch away  fucking did you see that  travis i did  liam yep 17 to a three  laura you need to not use that dice for the rest of the night  marisha nine  matt nine  marisha nine  matt nine again  sam and taliesin nein  matt at first it hits the dirt and it backs up you move out with your heel to go ahead and swing  and it actually ducks underneath and tries /none/ to snap at your heel as molly closes the gap and  travis would you like to go  sam i release my bolt at that same one  matt all right  sam 20  matt all right go ahead and roll damage with sneak attack  sam 13  matt yeah molly as you rush up you watch as a bolt just goes right through the side of the  hyenas head and it just falls lifeless to the ground all three of them out in a split second  travis i dont want to like make yall /none/ alarmed or anything but that was kind of fucking efficient  laura everybody but beau you were missing like crazy on that one  marisha you know i had a long day yesterday okay  travis hands are sweaty  marisha just was faster than i thought  laura hey look we can use this hyena meat as bait  travis youre right  sam im going to go pull my bolt out of the thing is it recoverable  taliesin good shot  matt yeah thankfully it was a clean enough shot didnt seem to get caught or shatter /none/ against any  of the bones  travis quick perimeter check to see if we alerted anything anythings looking at us  matt perception check  travis natural 19  matt glancing about the vicinity does not look like anything else is moving or near or has  noticed your presence  travis move to the cart quick check of anything left behind clues  sam do we need to drag these bodies  travis theres no bodies just blood spatter  marisha do you mean the hyenas  sam the hyenas  travis oh weve got to figure out /none/ where were going first  taliesin im also going to point out they hadnt been eating the hyenas anyway so maybe leaving  bodies of their pets is not the greatest idea  laura toss them into the grass then to get them out of view  taliesin that might be a smarter way to go  travis do it  laura okay ill pick them up and throw them as far as i can into the grass  matt okay like a massive shotput you watch as tiny jester with a double spin each chucks these  relatively heavy /none/ beasts deep into the grass field where they vanish with a heavy thud into the field  liam shes like miss trunchbull from matilda  travis youre a lot stronger than you look  laura thank you hey what happened to the little bunny though im going to look for the little  white rabbit  taliesin oh dear  matt bunny appears to no longer be around  laura thats really sad they ate it  travis yeah boy sure did  sam well have a funeral later  taliesin im going to keep a hold of my sword /dung/ but im going to wrap it in the coat so its not  glowing ridiculously  liam theres just the carts theres the one mine entrance  matt you dont see an entrance to the mine you just see mining equipment  marisha oh mining i misunderstood that too  matt you see pieces of equipment and the interior of this hill valley this short little  valley seems to have been prepped for some sort of mining expedition  sam theres no mine hole  matt you dont see one at the moment  liam ill take a look /none/ around to see if theres anything where they started or anything like that  marisha ill take the opposite side that hes doing  sam im going to look in the carts  matt okay you look in the carts and they are empty you see a few wayward pieces of cloth  everything in there is bloodied and caked and has streaks of it being licked up it looks like the  hyenas had been at it for a while trying to clear off what was left behind from wherever the bodies  that were within were taken i /none/ would like you both to make investigation checks please and youre  following the tracks  taliesin mmhmm  matt make a survival check  taliesin with advantage  matt because there are undead as a part of this i will let you  taliesin survival check  marisha and taliesin 14  liam 20  matt it looks like the dust and the dirt in this vicinity has been freshly swept or dispersed  intentionally meaning that once this little valley had been entered and the carts had been  emptied something was smart enough to intentionally cover their /none/ tracks you however  you rolled a 20 you said as you begin to look about the base of the closest hill facing away  from where you guys had entered in an eastern direction you see a pattern of grasses that seem  to be interwoven as opposed to a natural pattern there is a consistent mesh to the way theyve been laid  sam its a combover  laura it looks like how we put the stuff over the cart  matt as you glance over you can see a net of grasses that has been woven and /dung/ thrown over  leaving a small gap on the edge where you can see the dark exterior of what was a mine shaft  structure entrance  laura thats way smarter that what we did  marisha a ghillie net  liam but well remember it for the future  taliesin yours was handcrafted  sam why dont we just take this one  marisha thats what i was going to say is it heavy how big is this thing can we fold it up  and stuff it in a bag  matt its about 12 foot by 12 /none/ foot  marisha oh thats big  laura it could fit in a backpack maybe roll up  matt its pretty thick  sam its got sticks  matt well its thrown on and put against the grass it doesnt have sticks in its sides  sam does it have a frame of any sort  matt no its laid on the side of the hill  sam oh its a blanket oh okay we can take that  marisha we can grab it on our way back and throw it on the cart  laura throw it on the /none/ cart as were leaving  taliesin i miss being low enough level that we just take everything we find no matter how useful  laura like in skyrim just wheels of cheese all the cheese  taliesin were going to be cracking open clay pots  matt the scavenger levels man all righty it is too big for you to carry with you but it can  definitely be taken with you should you exit  liam how about whats behind the grass lets discuss this instead  matt all right as you pull it back you do see the /dung/ wooden support structure of the interior of a  mine shaft as soon as you pull it back and look inside it looks like a barricade has been  partially placed up on each side you see piles of broken furniture stools and chairs that are  shattered and jammed into each other to form some sort of a barricade on each side you can see  dryrotted pickaxe handles and other pieces of general wooden beams used for construction that  are all pushed up against the sides with a small path maybe about three feet wide that you /none/ could  walk through to enter it looks pitch black on the inside there is no light source outside of what  little bit of daylight is coming through from the entrance  liam sorry i was thinking about a thing you were saying there is a way through for us  matt there is a way theres about a two three foot gap between this barricade where it made its  way in and once you enter through you can now see since there has not been dust put there is a  definitive trail of blood that has /none/ dragged through and caked in the loose dirt and dust  taliesin should i give it a little light or no  sam wait before we go in  travis youre anxious to go you want to go first  sam no jesus no no please there were hyenas out here right posted as guards if one of the  hyenas had gone hyena howl would something have come out of this hole to come get us  liam i mean that is a fair assumption yeah  sam then why dont we make that sound and wait for something /dung/ to come out and kill it  laura well but what if it alerts a lot of the gnolls and then we dont have the element of  surprise at all anymore  liam well were talking  sam you want to go into that dark scary cave  laura it doesnt look that bad to me  sam it is a dark scary cave  travis frumpkin is still just a sweet little bird so i thought maybe a little quick flight in  marisha canary in a gnoll mine  laughter  travis oh oh smash  liam /dung/ jesus  marisha we have to do it its too perfect  travis canary in a gnoll mine  liam that was good  taliesin that was so painful  marisha sorry  liam do not be sorry  taliesin theres limits  travis i dont know if thats something frumpkin can do unless nott you just wanna go in there  and go kamikaze  sam no im drinking again  matt okay you are now officially intoxicated  sam i dont have to roll it just happens  matt yep  sam great  matt for the next /none/ hour  laura what does that mean  sam ill go in if you need me to  travis oh shit oh shit oh yes  taliesin no oh wow  laura is that where the brave comes from  marisha that was going to be my question  travis we get her hammered and shes the most fucking badass  laura oh my god this is awesome  travis oh no  liam frumpkin has been a sparrow before sparrows dont have darkvision do they  matt no  sam its a night sparrow he should have said  /none/ liam no it is a regular sparrow  travis my only concern is if we draw them out there could be more than us right i just want to  get a quick peek if we can  liam well i mean i can send him in there hell probably hit the wall a few times but if theres  any fire or anything  travis you wouldnt mind  liam no you know i can always bring him back but be careful all right but there he goes  matt yeah theres no light in there about 25 feet /none/ in go ahead and make a perception check  laura yeah you wont be able to see anything through it  liam 21  matt 21 what faint light is coming in from the interior are you looking through  liam yeah i am  matt yeah as soon as you come inside about 40 feet in the shaft widens into a common area you  see a handful of tables some chairs similar to what was placed within the barricade some sacks  strewn about some torn open and scattered across the ground some that are still lobbed in /dung/ the corner  liam is that from a light source inside or from sunlight coming in  matt this is just a very high perception roll with what little light is making its way in there  and thats where it goes dark and theres a thud as frumpkin hits a sloping ceiling  marisha and dies  matt no just hits the ground  liam please no  matt hits the ground stunned  laura its like those birds that hit our windows at home  marisha thats right yeah  liam okay well i think i have seen /dung/ all i am going to see for the moment but i didnt see  anything in there  matt not in that main area  liam nothing living in there that i saw  matt not with what little bit frumpkin saw with a quick glance before it got too dark and then he  hit the ceiling  liam okay nott my friend i think maybe this is a time where you could please dont go crazy  but maybe go in 30 or 40 feet theres a room in there and i dont think theres anything in  /none/ there but you would see  sam drunkenly im just going to go in there and get the gnolls  laura im gonna bless you before you go so you can be sneakier  sam great  travis consonants are gone  sam can sparrows hear  liam i can hear through my sparrow  sam i could bring the sparrow you could at least hear whats going on like a walkie talkie  marisha like a walkie talkie  liam thats correct richtig go  sam okay ill take the sparrow jam it in there  liam wait i /none/ dont want to get punched in the face while im blind somebody please put a hand  on my shoulder  sam oh you got to hold his hand  laura are we going in  sam no hes going to go into that other place  laura oh okay  liam if something bad is going to happen just shake me  marisha ill punch you in the face  liam no dont do that just shake me  laura just tickle his balls  liam dont do that just  sam im going to go in  matt /none/ okay  taliesin punch him in the balls  matt you move past the barricades heading towards the shaft the barricade theres a lot  of stuff jammed up here at the front almost like it was barricaded from the inside long ago and  then was cleared out partially going through you make it through the 35 or so feet of the shaft in  towards where it opens up and you almost trip because your toe catches something and you catch  yourself and you look down to see a long piece of rope that was stretched across /none/ that just got  tugged and falls slack  laura oh no you didnt see that  matt you hear a creak and with your darkvision glance up and see what appears to be a large log  that had been affixed to the ceiling whoosh comes rushing towards you make a dexterity saving throw  liam you are a wee baby rogue  sam great check disadvantage great check  laura good phew  sam what is this dex save  matt dex saving throw yeah  sam 24  matt with disadvantage you even in your somewhat hazy /none/ drunken stupor see it just in time  and back up as it whoosh right past your nose and slams into the wall to the left of you it  hits and you see the dust settle from the ceiling  travis that my lads was a dragon  matt you guys all hear this slamming from the inside  liam oh shit  sam im okay it was just wood  marisha whats going on  liam ive heard a confusing thing something fell down but okay were good  taliesin i think we might have lost the element /none/ of surprise  sam is it a bigger space in here  matt it is actually it opens up to be about 35 feet across from side to side about 45 or 50  towards the end and then it seems to descend into two different pathways  sam any signs of life anything  matt make a perception check  sam eight  matt at the moment no but as youre glancing about you can see that there are bags of supplies  that are partially sundered and torn open you can see tools some that look pretty interesting /none/  theres a crowbar on the ground across the way theres other sacks that havent been spoiled yet  you see some of the burlap is dry rotted and pulls right apart and it looks like there might be some  useful things in this chamber  sam okay real quick ill just poke through one of the bags  matt make an investigation check with disadvantage  sam oh well then okay eight  matt you glance through and find a bunch of mildewed rice grain right as you hear a snort  sam i will freeze and slowly /none/ turn to the sound  matt you glance over and from the right chamber you see as two gnolls have appeared in the  entranceway and have entered up called from the sound of the heavy impacting thud on the wall but  a few moments ago  laura are you stealthed  matt they both no hes not she is not sorry they both arrive to the top of the sniffing and  growling they both grab their spears  sam im going to say help me help me now please come in save me save my life  /none/ liam help me help me now save my life we have to go in here we go  matt what are you doing  sam i am going to draw and fire at one  matt as theyre both right there rushing towards you you say this and youre going to pull out and  fire at one the one to the right or the left  sam the first one who spotted me  matt the one that first spotted you would be the one on the left so as its rushing towards you go  ahead and fire /none/  sam okay 18  matt 18 hits go ahead and roll damage  sam eight  matt eight points of damage not  sam ten 11 points of damage because im going to use fury of the small  matt okay 11 points of damage it hurts but its still rushing forward they both begin to  rush in to close the gap the rest of you guys rush in to get to him it will take the full round to get  there you guys use your movement and dash in those of you who dont have darkvision /none/ you cant  see anything  taliesin i also uncover my sword at this point which gives off a little bit of light  matt a faint bit of light at this point any of you with ranged abilities right now would be able  to strike but before you do two of the gnolls rush in and are attempting to attack the small  goblinoid female who has walked into their lair the first strike that is going to be a 21 to hit  sam definitely hits any of us  matt that is six points of piercing /none/ damage as the spear jams into your shoulder and scrapes down the  front of your chest glances off the rest of your armor and it hurts but youre fine youre still  feeling a little fuzzy anyway the other one attacks that is going to be a 15 to hit  sam no  matt no this one you do see coming and you dodge out of the way but theyre both right up in  your face right now snarling and growling with that the guys who have ranged attacks go for it  liam wait so the /dung/ whole party ran in  matt yes  liam as that was happening the two humans in tandem said wait let them draw out their fuck  marisha its so dark  matt so you guys have disadvantage on any of your attacks rolls because you cannot see you are  blind in the chamber  liam are we doing initiative or are we just going  matt for this round because theres just two gnolls at the moment im just going through  actions here to keep going  liam dancing lights  laura guiding bolt on the one /none/ closest to me  travis eldritch blast on the other one  matt okay so the one thats closest to you will be the one that already took damage from the bolt  so roll for attack for the guiding bolt  laura 21  matt 21 hits roll damage  sam jesus  laura six nine ten  matt ten points  laura ten points  matt the one thats now taken a crossbow bolt to the throat and has taken a guiding bolt this giant  blast of light explodes around this gnoll as it yelps and it /none/ encompasses its torso with this  glittering light now the next attack against it has advantage it is super hurt but still  standing youre making your attack  travis yeah i rolled the first one which was a 24 but with advantage thats less so 24  matt you were attacking the other one so you do not get the benefit  travis oh yeah im sorry 24 for the first roll  matt still hits go ahead and roll damage on that one  travis oh balls thats  matt what are you using  travis eldritch blast /none/  matt its a d10 for damage thats a d12  travis oh that is a 12 sorry my bad  sam thats the other character  travis old habits they die hard nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage on that one it gets blasted by the bolt of eldritch energy however  its still snarling currently theyre both looking over at the sudden surge of newcomers  taliesin ive also got a distance attack im going to use devils tongue on the one that just  survived your hit  matt okay what does that /none/ do  taliesin im going to use vicious mockery in infernal you will feed the dogs in hell  laura oh wow i understood that it was scary  matt they rolled an eight minus yeah it does not make the save  taliesin it takes 1d4 psychic which is three points of psychic damage and has disadvantage on  its next attack  matt got it great  liam four globules of light dancing lights the room is lit up  matt all right the room fills with light at this point the chamber fills you can now see /none/ the  scenery around you nott youre up first since youre the first one to get a shot theres one  thats super hurt and one thats kind of hurt  sam ill go for the super hurt one whos right in front of me right  matt correct  sam whats wrong  marisha it fits in there  laura oh yeah thats the thing  sam thats what im doing laura discovered this last week  laura it stays up super good  matt nott theyre both right up in your face snarling  sam im going to /none/ go to the super hurt one and be like scream grab it and ill do shocking grasp  matt okay so go ahead and make your melee spell attack i believe it is right  sam yep thats a 19  matt 19 hits  sam okay i dont know how to do this hold on is this a ten no thats a ten this is an eight seven  matt seven it is as you reach up and grab it with your hand you watch as a burst of electrical  arcane energy surges through its body you watch /none/ as veins pop up its torso to its neck before it  collapses into the ground you have to duck out of the way before it slams it would have crushed you  if youd stayed in the space you were but you sidestep in time as the gnoll falls to the ground lifeless  sam am i in range wheres the other gnoll is it right on me  matt yeah  sam okay i will bonus action disengage and run all the way around to the other side of the room  matt okay on the other side /none/ as youre doing that the gnoll thats right there sees you rushing  off but now its more attentive to the one who blasted it there id say for the sake of  distance since the moment you saw you fired it probably couldnt close the gap so its going to  drop the spear pull out its longbow and take a shot at you from here  travis oh shit  matt its going to be a 14 to hit whats your armor class  travis 14  matt 14 all right not a great roll you take four /none/ points of piercing damage  travis four points  matt it catches you right in the middle of the sternum the armor takes the brunt of it and it  mostly just snaps at the impact but it hurt itll bruise that ends the remaining gnolls  turn next up would be beau  marisha oh are there any close to me  matt theres one you can close the gap with theres only one thats currently standing in the  room the other ones been killed it was shocked to death by nott  marisha okay ill close the /none/ gap and come at it with a big double swing from my staff  matt go for it  marisha finally a decent roll 19  matt 19 hits go ahead and roll damage  marisha six plus four thats ten points of damage  matt ten points of damage thats enough to do it it had already been damaged previously by  fjords eldritch blast and you watch as it snarls and pulls out its bow pulls back notches and  releases the arrow moments after its released with a quick burst of action you saunter up to its /none/  side and hit it across the torso with the stick you feel seven different ribs break as it doubles  forward as it looks at you for a second you take where the staff has broken in and jam upward  to where its lungs would be and it chokes and falls to the ground dead  marisha i shake it off my staff a little bit  travis damn you broke its ribs to get to its organs  marisha its effective  laura singsong i cut off the ears  matt you guys take a moment here /none/  taliesin put them in the jar  laura and taliesin its an ear jar  laura our pickle jar  matt and taliesin is now an ear jar  travis what happened howd they find you  sam i dont know theyre very clever i was sneaking all the way down and they still  discovered me i dont know how  taliesin we look at the rope connected to the log  matt yeah as notts saying this your eyes wander off of her over to the right where you see this  heavy tree covered in jagged /none/ bark thats creaking  sam that happened after they discovered me  travis right  laura ooh what are all these bags in here  sam i was about to go through them do you want to help  laura yeah  travis i will keep an eye down the tunnel that they came from while they pillage  marisha ill look around are there any other entrances  liam as youre looking im going to pull all the dancing lights down to one and put the rag over it  and walk beside beau so that she can see /dung/  matt okay there are two shafts both seem to descend both curving off in opposite directions  they both have the wooden frame for support  sam wooden shafts  liam come on you people we need a corner and a camera for the corner and a long paper hat for  you to put you in the corner  laura i didnt even react to it he had to point it out  matt looking around it looks like this was a common area this is the closest chamber to the  exterior of the mine it looks /none/ like there were a number of tables here that a lot of them have  been knocked over and broken a lot of what would have filled this chamber has been pushed into the  barricade you saw up front youre helming the investigation go ahead and make an investigation check  marisha that was me me and caleb  matt you guys are looking down the shafts theyre looking in the sacks  marisha oh sorry for the bags yeah  matt both of the shafts just descend and curve out of view they go to a steady 45degree /tavern/ decline  sam im helping no no  laura do i get advantage because theyre helping  matt youre too drunk to help  taliesin i was helping  matt youre looking as well sure take advantage then  laura that is not as good investigation 11  matt 11 okay you glance around you find theres an untapped ale barrel theres an  untapped water barrel theres a hooded lantern that still has a functional bit of oil in it  though its only about halffull and very rusted over but you clear off the glass on the outside /none/  and itll work fine you find a sledgehammer that the handle is not so rotted to the point where it  wouldnt be functional but a fair sledgehammer if you wanted to break any rock or stone the crowbar  that you had seen earlier that can be acquired  laura we should write this stuff down  matt you find a small lightweight rod about that long that has a short piece of waxed twine  hanging from one end  laura is it metal did you say  matt no its not metal it feels almost like /none/ a hard clay  laura with wax  matt with a waxed piece of twine on one end  taliesin can i make a knowledge test to see if i would know what this is  sam a knowledge test you mean an intelligence check  taliesin well is this intelligence or what would this be im trying to think i might have  come across this  matt you had as good a chance as anybody to have come across this so if you want to make an  intelligence check  taliesin just an intelligence check im trying /none/ to remember 11  matt you havent come across one of these  laura well i have it then the water  sam a water jug and an ale  laura a water jug and an ale jug  sam not jug it was a barrel  travis casks  laura oh so i cant carry that with me theyre big  matt no theyre big heavy filled things  taliesin we can put them aside we will be bringing them out of here  matt you make an intelligence check  liam okay thats okay thats scheiße where did /none/ it go over here dd beyond it is ten yeah i  rolled very low  matt ten okay  taliesin whispering human want a lantern  marisha oh yes did you light it is it a lit lantern  taliesin i havent lit it yet you can light it ill help  laura its hooded so you can close off the light  marisha oh i can close it on and off right like one of those things  matt once its ignited and the oils lit yeah you can open and close the hood  taliesin im onehanded /none/ so i cant really help you light it  travis well whatve we got are we happy  laura yeah i found a small rod and a crowbar and a sledgehammer  travis are you going to carry the sledgehammer  laura is it heavy  travis not for you beast mode  matt nott youre an alchemist  liam does the rod look like crudely made or prettily designed  sam apparently im looking it over  matt yeah as youre looking over it its not beautifully made it looks functional like a lot  of the tools here /dung/ there isnt a lot of presentation more than function as what you bring  into a mine  liam okay no carving no glyphs no nothing like that just caked in shit  matt yeah  liam okay  matt you take the rod and smell it and a familiar scent hits your nose youve worked in your  alchemical time with smalllevel explosives as part of the elements of the alchemists fire  there is a reagent catalyst that when the chemicals mix it causes a minor explosion and then  burns heavily there is an element of that /none/ but its very very strong and a very intense scent to  it as soon as you smell it it brings back memories of accidents that have happened in the  past on a very small scale you immediately get this wave of cold shiver down your neck that this  is a very dangerous object if used improperly  sam yeah careful with that i think maybe none of us should hold that maybe fjord he seems sort  of responsible no dont make it a mustache  laughter  sam it could blow up your face it could /none/ blow up your face yeah its a boomboom stick thats  the alchemical term  laura oh shit  sam i think if you put it near fire it could go explode who wants to hold it who is not jester  travis yeah ill take it  laura give me my pencil though no  sam oh great throw a sharp object  taliesin anyone watching at home the physics was really demanding on that one  laura can i put the sledgehammer on my back  matt yeah you can sling it in with your  laura my /none/ shield  marisha all right guys left tunnel or right tunnel  travis ill tuck the rod into my belt  sam its fine ill go down the tunnel and scope it out for us  taliesin well before we do that we should remember to check for traps maybe  sam oh  laura oh can you do that  sam i dont know  taliesin i certainly cant  travis you can  taliesin no i cant i cant do any of that  laura i can look for them  taliesin i wont be able to find /none/ them  sam i can look for them too i dont know what a trap looks like  laura well what did that one look like that you got hit with before  sam big piece of rope probably should have seen it  laura maybe look for ropes crossing the ground  sam all right  travis maybe we view this an opportunity to grow and we look for those now  sam i will make a mental note  travis great  sam look for big pieces of rope  travis yeah anything that looks out of the /none/ ordinary out of place on the wall on the floors  liam have a peekypoo around as you go  travis are you still shithoused are you fucking hammered still  sam dont tell me what i can and cant drink  laughter  liam you know she does this from time to time she becomes a little unpredictable but you cant  argue with the results you really cannot  marisha i kind of like her when shes like this its good  travis okay she needs another shot  sam you want me to go ahead again  /none/ travis yeah  sam oh boy  laura which one are we going down though theres two entrances arent there  matt there are two paths yes  sam ill go down one just a little ways and then ill come back  laura you should actually stealth though this time okay  sam i will stealth im going to stealth  laura you have a blessing  sam and search for traps  matt okay so make a stealth check first  laura with advantage  sam oh good okay 20something  matt well with advantage but then disadvantage /tavern/ from the drunk so its just a straight roll  sam the first roll  matt yes  sam 13  matt okay good to know then youre going to check for traps  sam yes  matt make an investigation check with disadvantage  sam with disadvantage  matt laura and liam because youre drunk  sam that affects yeah  liam you cant tell me what i can do matthew  matt dexteritybased and intelligencebased checks  sam thats all of the checks so zero  matt okay  sam oh wait no no i did the math /tavern/ wrong its ten im drunk guys  travis i know the feeling  matt okay and which path is this youre checking  sam left  laura i was going to say left i knew  sam i love you  travis do you want to check air current temperature nothing anything  marisha yeah little drafts anything like that  matt you dont sense any draft the air is pretty stagnant actually  travis temperature equal on both sides  matt seems to be on the left path you do not notice any traps anything akin to what you /none/  stumbled across as you entered it does seem to descend and curve out of the way but begin to  snake a bit you get about 15 to 20 feet down before it begins to rapidly curve left and right  its only about ten feet wide you can continue if you want  sam no thanks okay ill go back and report what ive heard or what ive learned  laura do either of the two paths have more tracks coming in and out of them  matt they both seem fairly equal youve been keeping tabs on /none/ footfalls in here theres traffic  both ways  travis you know what could be really handy in this situation is some of that fancy fucking  thread of yours  liam for keeping things alerting us of things coming here or  travis yeah i dont mind commiting to one of these tunnels i just want to make sure nothing  comes behind us or comes up from the other way  liam yeah thats a good suggestion first what are we doing what did you find out down that way  sam it just keeps going and starts /none/ snaking and theres no traps though  laura lets go down the right one  sam why  liam i think we should also send you down that one as well to have a look around  sam all right here i go  laughter  matt make a stealth check please  sam okay and looking for traps stealth with  matt disadvantage  laura no  matt oh its straight roll because  sam okay 25 24 something its a lot  matt all right and investigation check with disadvantage  sam investigation is 13  matt with /none/ disadvantage  travis because youre hammered  sam yeah 13  travis yes  matt you begin to curve down the right path and there is a slight depression on one side that you  glance over and look and it looks like some of the burlap that had been torn from the sacks earlier in the  tunnel had been used to cover a three and a half foot wide pit that has been laced over to  hide its presence  sam its just burlap over a pit in the ground  matt yeah its affixed with a /none/ couple of rocks in the sides its very light and would have fallen  through it only covers part of the path the tunnel is about ten feet wide and the right side  of it is where that pitfall is you notice it and go oh hmm this one does not snake this one  continues in a continual curve for another 40 or so feet before youre starting to get a little far  from your friends you can continue if you want  sam it just keeps curving and curving  matt it looks like its going /none/ in a downward spiral  sam oh a downward spiral okay ill go back and report what i saw  matt great album  taliesin so true  sam all right so one path goes wiggedy woo and the other path goes zibbidy zow  taliesin were there any traps  sam no traps oh yes there was a trap to be fair there was one trap i thought you meant any  sprung traps there was a trap  travis you sussed it out  sam i sussed it out dont worry ill take care of it  liam /none/ how far down did you go each way  sam 40 feet down the ziggedy zow and like 25 feet down the zibbidy zoo  liam well my instinct tells me that if theres something there that they would trap it so  probably more valuable if were going on nothing take the path that is trapped  laura i agree  taliesin hear hear  sam youre so smart  laura unless they want us to think its the path that theyve trapped  sam reverse psychology  laura thats right and its actually the path that is least /none/ resistance  taliesin unless they knew that you would think that  sam oh reverse reverse psychology  liam these are dog people lets take the path with the trap  taliesin trap trap  sam right path  matt as you all slowly begin to descend down the right path  laura were stealthing  matt well come to that in just a second were going to go ahead and take a break since its a little  past nine well be back here in a few minutes to pick up the descent further into this mineshaft  laura /none/ and matt into madness  liam down the wooden shaft  matt before we get to that however we do have a giveaway from our friends at wyrmwood as you saw  last week we have another of their black walnut two of their adventurer arsenals to give away again  this week if you havent seen theyre awesome wellmade and if you open it up on the inside it  has space for you dice for your pen a place for a mini or eraser or anything else you want to  carry

all woo  matt congratulations to the two of you guys danoba will reach out to you and get your contact  information and well get those sent to you asap so well done  yes all right you chose the right or the left again  sam and laura the right  matt the right okay down the path the shaft winds for about another 150 or so feet before it  slowly levels out into a long chamber of multiple levels what once looked like /none/ a solid mining vein  is now strewn with bones and flayed skin pinned to the rock walls with scavenged nails blood  spattered across them with intent painted a jagged smile of sharp teeth on each of these four hides  a faint source of light in the center flickers a small stone altar holding a cluster of candles in  the central level platform it looks like about six gnolllike figures have gathered around this stone  laura we were stealthing we were stealthing  matt i know were going to get to that in just a second /dung/  laura okay  matt while a strange seventh figure places small wet stones upon this altar smaller than the other  gnolls lets get a perception check real fast from two of you whos leading the  sam i would have been bringing them down right  liam you can see in the dark  laura yeah i can see in the dark ill look  matt well say since you two would be in the front then for that you jumped up first  perception check both of you  sam five  marisha this sucks  laura /none/ 11  matt okay so you dont see much of the figure also right now ill have you guys all do a  stealth check please as you make your way down  taliesin do i still have advantage  laura no he has advantage now sorry  taliesin thats okay  sam 22  laura 15  taliesin nine  liam ten  marisha 22  travis 15  matt okay  laura oh no  sam looks like this is the wrong path everyone we should probably go back to the other sorry  matt this figure looks /dung/ gnolllike you see the ears and the snout but as it reaches down and  picks up these wet stones and places them in the altar giving small dark muffled barks and  yipping sounds you see elements that look like smooth human flesh the more that you focus in  you can see this looks to be a humanoid figure that is wearing pieces of hollowedout gnolllike  armor a hood missing a jaw thats placed over the top of the head sections of arms worn like a  glove with the hand missing sifted through it seems that /none/ a lot of the body parts are discolored  and rotting a bit from what you can see from the candle light thats flickering across it long  bonelike spines similar to what adorned the armor of that pack lord that you battled in the middle  of the city last night are also affixed to the outsides and pierced through elements of the  shoulders and head of this flesh gnoll hide that its wearing as it growls mimicking the sounds  of the gnolls that it seems to be residing along the other gnolls around look pacing from /none/ foot to  foot impatiently growls and grunts begins to speak louder and louder at this altar as it places a  final wet stone on it all the remaining gnolls begin to bark in unison together bark and howl  laura whisper should we stop this  matt they all at once leap onto the altar and begin tearing into the stones which are not  stones they were glistening at this point you see hearts that are now being torn and swallowed by  the gnolls at the altar  laura should we kill them all  sam /none/ no  travis dont make a sound  liam vomiting  marisha oh that was well done  matt they finish devouring the hearts and the humanoid figure begins to bark a few more times  and then in broken common says the hunger will be fed ours and hers come and points to two of  them help me carry more meat below the rest stay feast on what remains turns around and you  now look across the way on the other side of the chamber darkened you see a gnoll leaning in  familiar armor the one /none/ that you had battled and had left with the carts is watching from the  far end of the chamber down on the lower thirdlevel platform  laura the big mama jama  matt the weird gnoll priest i guess you could say at this point thats been helming this little  ritual goes and joins the armored gnolls and steps aside and follows second and the two gnolls that  were assigned by it leave as well leaving four in there in the chamber currently  sam including the armored one or no  matt no the armored one /none/ leaves with the priest  liam did you describe any light source in here that theyre working by  matt the candle altar yeah its not an extremely bright light but for those of you who  are human its enough where you can make out shapes once your eyes have adjusted to the low  light interior  liam got it  matt you watch as they begin to grab the bodies on the ground you can see there are now the  grinding of bones as they drag broken corpses across the floor and begin to tear into /none/ the torsos  laura while thats happening im going to cast very quietly cure wounds on nott next to me  because i saw youre bleeding yo  sam oh sorry what does that do  laura you just regained nine hit points  sam ooh nine  taliesin this is getting ridiculous  laura yay  matt barking you watch as four hyenas fill into the space where the gnolls are and begin to sit at  bay waiting for the gnolls to finish feasting one of them gets close and the gnoll just grabs its  head and /none/ shoves it against the wall and it snaps into the wall and then backs up and then waits its  turn you can see the other hyenas that exist in this space naturally scavengers have to wait  being at the lowest of the totem pole  travis how many total  matt four gnolls four hyenas  marisha fuck  liam the one that got thrown into the wall it got stunned or hurt it didnt get any  matt it didnt seem to be too much more to just keep it away from the meal  taliesin we /none/ know they go down very quickly  marisha im afraid if we keep waiting more will just show up  laura yeah lets kill them  liam whispering here we go  sam what were just going to go theres no plan  marisha well maybe we can draw a few over to us and take them out on our terms  matt if youre planning to engage should i show you the layout of where theyre placed  all yes  sam he says coyly would you like to see the layout of the room  travis i dont /none/ like seven on eight i am not a fan  sam seven  laura but theyre little  sam six  laura the hyenas are little  sam oh yashas with us right  laughing  liam the hyenas are just doggos  sam yeah theyve got like four hit points you can take out two of them in one go if you were  you know grog  matt so here we have  laura oh ones an archer twos an archer threes an archer  matt they all tend to carry a bow on their backs  laura /none/ shit fours an archer  matt you can see now the hyenas that are waiting patiently this one got knocked into the wall  theyre scooting at the sides waiting for them to finish their meals you guys are right up here  where the shaft opens glancing down into this chamber that was where the priest and the other  gnolls had exited  sam were up on top up there  matt you guys are up on here which for the purposes of  travis good thing were metal  matt its fine  travis i mean i /dung/ hate it but  sam is there any way to even the playing field a bit any strategy fjord and caleb come on  liam what about the boom stick that you have we can chuck it into the  laura oh wouldnt that be really loud wouldnt that draw them back though  liam yes it would but  travis plus were in a mine  laura it might bring the whole thing down on us  sam maybe we could use that to escape later  laura yeah definitely  travis theres a big column thats in between /none/ them right  matt correct  travis is it a column or a stalagmite  matt it looks like it was a stalactite that then was reinforced as a column to help  maintain the structure  marisha if we can make some sort of distraction to get their attention and if we can put or  heavy hitters our people up front we can try and hold them in this mouth ranged people in the back  travis do you want to throw the rod at the column  laura i feel like we should do that when were /none/ leaving we shouldnt do that before we go in  because were not going to be able to get to anything  travis theres another path down  laura well yeah but this is very loud it would draw things up here  liam where would you want this distraction to be because i can make a little  travis behind them and make them turn away from us because were in a fatal funnel up here at the top  liam i can make a little dancing golden person of light appear down at the bottom of the passage /none/  matt a fifth gnoll begins to wander its way into the chamber  marisha you see more are going to keep coming  matt it goes over and kicks one of the hyenas off to the side it sits there snuffling and whining  taliesin we can see now or try the other way  liam if theres more in there theyre just going to come in here anyway  beau and its not confined  travis i genuinely feel like we should go the other way  sam the other way this is it this is the other /none/ way  travis theres a whole other path  sam its nothing  travis no  sam thats nothing  travis do you know  sam no im guessing  liam heres the question do you think these things are going to come out of here right away  or is it worth a shot maybe there is a way around to a way theyre not expecting  marisha normally miners build coal mines with connecting shafts and double exits in case one  side collapses you always want another way out we just dont know where theyve put everybody /none/  were here looking for villagers remember  liam you know theres nothing saying we have to run in here if were not feeling this we can  backtrack and look in the other direction in fact im leaning that way  marisha hey matt dm question if we were to try and back out of here and draw them towards us  what would that be just a tunnel  matt yeah this tunnel is a tenfoot wide tunnel that continues backward  liam plus we do have a map here  sam five gnolls weve got these guys /none/  laura we can try attacking them and if it gets bad then we use the tnt  liam use dd  marisha yeah thats what i heard  sam dd  laura no tnt  taliesin the longer we wait the more things are coming  sam maybe its the whiskey talking but i think weve got these guys  matt if you wanted to turning you backward here theres this path here we could continue the  tunnel back this way  marisha its only a death funnel if were the ones dying right if theyre dying thats /none/ good  for us  sam how far is it on the map from where were standing to the farthest gnoll  matt the farthest gnoll there about 60 or so feet  sam we can definitely do a distraction to get some of them to turn away from us at least we get  a round in  laura get a surprise round  liam i can make a little golden person dance behind that guy there  laura we can get a surprise round on all of them  marisha surprise round get as many range and aoe /none/ spells off as we can  liam aoe surprise round what are you talking about  taliesin be helpful  travis can i use this planning moment to cast armor of agathys on myself  matt you may  travis spectral frost collects from the air on my armor  matt which as a note to remind you from last time  travis i didnt give myself enough cold damage  matt correct yeah so keep that in mind  sam okay are you going to try your thing or should i try my thing first  liam what is /none/ your thing  sam i dont know i can try something i can do a similar thing have them see something behind  them but you can do the same thing yours are already cast right  liam not right now no but its like that snaps its easy this one  sam okay i could try to get one of them to fight with one of the other ones of them  laura and marisha yeah thats good  liam do that  sam im going to sneak up down the steps to that little crook in there  /none/ matt right here  sam little further back yeah is that all right do i have to roll or anything  matt roll a stealth check  sam oh shit okay with disadvantage  matt do you still have the gift  laura no you still have blessing  sam oh so 26 that puts me within 30 feet of those guys right  matt oh yeah  sam and what are they doing eating hearts  matt at a closer glance you look and see one of them currently is holding a pair of legs that are  no /none/ longer attached to a torso and is stripping the flesh from the thigh and leg tearing into it  takes a piece and chucks it off to the side and the two hyenas fight over it another one back  there you can see is clutching a scapula the back of a shoulder blade and is breaking the  bones in half and sucking the marrow out at a quick glance you get the sense that some of these  may have been denizens of alfield as of 24 hours ago  liam im going to start throwing up again /none/ soon so lets either do this or backtrack please  sam are they carrying anything on their bodies on their person anything canteens or weapons or  equipment or anything  matt the gnolls  sam the gnolls  matt most of them have a longbow slung over their shoulder and have a spear that dangles off to the  side or has been jammed in the ground next to them  laura while hes doing it im getting ready im doing this im going to cast mirror image of myself  matt duplicity or are you doing mirror image /none/ the spell  laura mirror image  marisha lets all agree that if this goes bad we run  laura suddenly there are three mes around myself  travis if we need to close it off light the tip of that little wick and throw it  liam are we going right now  marisha oh god  sam are any of them holding anything that they put down for a second or they got it firmly in  their claws  matt the one that breaks and sucks the marrow out of one of the large shoulder blade areas /none/ takes and  grinds the teeth against it scooping out whatevers inside then throws that piece onto the  ground next to it then takes the arm and begins to splinter the middle of the arm bone and try to  get the marrow out of that  sam are you going to do your thing  liam are you about to go  sam i dont know you tell me  liam im going to really quickly mutter a few arcane words then there is another caleb blinking  in front of me a little bit and behind me /none/ a little bit it is hard to see me at the moment  laura are you casting blur or mirror image  sam what are those words  laura i want to know for my own sake  liam i dont care  marisha can i get more into a place with beau in this crux mirroring nott stealth check natural 20  matt does your spell have concentration you are concentrating on a spell at the moment beau you  quickly leap and land with no sound catlike reflexes  marisha threepoint landing  matt your foot does slide /none/ for a second as you glance down and where you stepped in it looks  like theres a bit of leftover pieces of people  marisha i gagging  sam i whisper a couple words and use mage hand to pick up the little piece of shoulder blade he  dropped and throw it in the face of the other guy  matt okay it slowly lifts and one of the other gnolls thats eating splat growling and the  other one goes yipping and they go back to eating  sam they dont care thought they would kill each /none/ other i dont know that was it were level  three thats all i got  liam whoomp a little halflingsized person of light appears behind the gnoll at the far end there  matt what is it what are you using  liam im using dancing lights you can use the four lights to make a little person a little  humanoid shape of light it is doing a little macarena behind the gnoll all the way i have 120  feet of range  matt that spell is not concentration right okay  liam yes it is but /none/ i would know that im not going to do that because of my keen memory that  caleb has but not liam  sam im going to turn around and whisper to caleb are you going to do the thing but im  using message so no one can hear us are you going to do the thing if not i can do my thing  liam i send frumpkin through the chamber and down and starts battering into the walls here  matt as soon as frumpkin begins doing that you watch as the one thats nearest on this /none/ side the  one that had dropped the arm piece earlier takes the bow off its back and begins to notch an arrow  looking around its going to take a shot at the bird fluttering through that is a 17 whats frumpkins  liam oh im sure that hits yeah  matt six points of piercing damage the bird goes thud on the ground and then dissipates you  watch as the four hyenas suddenly rush in towards where the bird had fallen and they all go to the  spot where it landed and find an arrow lying /none/ there and snarling and yipping  laura i cast spiritual weapon above the two gnolls directly in front of me  matt the range on that is  laura range on that is 60 feet  matt youre placing it where right there  laura yeah

hide behind a barrel like its going to make any fucking  difference at all  matt sure you wont get to hide though but youre there youre standing next to a barrel  all righty whos up next  travis im

into my hand  matt yep it appears into your space in a burst of dull greenishblue fire and there you see it  dripping with salt water across its blade  travis can i use my bonus action to cast hex at that right gnoll  matt you may that /none/ one is now hexed you watch as the gore thats been dripping from the front of  its body seems to roll up its torso in reverse before it slips into its armor and grasps itself  the darkened shadowed gore now holding it in place as the hex curse  travis can i reach back and fire eldritch blast into it  matt you may  travis 16  matt that hits plus 1d6  travis six plus four ten 1d6 15 points of damage  matt 15 points of damage explosion that one immediately drops what it was /none/ eating as the blast  slams into it as its confused by the wrapping of the hex as it reels and almost stumbles onto its  back its foot crushes one of the nearby skulls and there you see this gaping wound in its chest  where the armors been sundered theres a smoking plume of blackened horrible shaded smoke pouring  from it  travis can i use my distance to move over here if i may  matt thats as far as you can there  travis am i in your line of sight jester does anybody need /none/ that  laura nah youre fine  marisha nope  matt beau  marisha okay im going to do something weird and i hope it works and doesnt fuck the rest of  us ill move up right here next to fjord 40 that works good there  matt thats 20 there  marisha let me go one more thats good then can i reach in my bag and grab out in my little  pouch grab out a handful out of my 1000 ball bearings  travis you do have 1000 ball bearings i remember that we had money /none/ she bought a lot of  fucking ball bearings  marisha a lot of ball bearings can i take it and you know how you can take your pocket and  flip it inside out and have a bunch of ball bearings go metallic clinking across this way  matt you hear hundreds of tiny metal clangs in succession as ball bearings begin to spray down  the stairs and scattering across the floor of this central makeshift ritual room as they run through  the semblances of gore and the areas of the stonework that are exposed between you /none/ have spent  your action scattering  marisha is that my action okay im going to spend a ki point and as my bonus action take  patient defense  matt nice as soon as you empty those out you get back and go into your defensive position  preparing for any sort of assault caleb  liam the effect of that hasnt taken place yet correct  matt the ball bearings in this moment are now clattering down into the ground  liam did fjord hit one successfully  matt he did yes  liam that same one i /none/ am just going to fire bolt it from yeah yeah  matt roll for an attack  liam fire bolt that is an attack range guy plus six that is a 15 to hit  matt that hits just barely  liam the damage is seven  matt seven points of damage the one that you had hexed suddenly goes up into flames with a  dying scream and falls back onto the ground  liam ill use my movement to back up about 15 feet just outside of the chamber  matt you are just there as the flash /none/ of red light arcs from his finger and lights up the path  before it impacts and kills the gnoll caleb then steps back into the shadows trying to get out of  the way nott  sam oh i get a turn as well because i did the mage hand thing  matt yes but that technically did not initiate into a combat it just bothered one of them  sam mildly  matt a temporary inconvenience  sam sure ill send an arrow down into the one that jester attacked  matt go for it  sam thats /none/ 23  matt 23 hits roll damage  sam nine  matt nine plus your sneak attack  sam this is a sneak attack  matt because you were stealthed  sam 14  liam rogue best class  matt that one explosion the bolt goes through the center of his forehead and embeds itself right  up to the very back you watch as it dying scream and falls into the ground over one of the piled corpse  pieces it was tearing through becoming one with its meal and then  sam crouch back and hide  matt /none/ okay make a hide check to try and disappear back there stealth on that one  sam advantage but disadvantage so 16  matt okay you did your thing molly  taliesin im going to creep out against the wall closest to me and try and hide in one of these  coves over in the corner as far as i can get into the  matt you can get right into the similar space as nott there  sam does he see me  matt i would say barely  travis hello  sam hi  taliesin since im /none/ too far away for anything too crazy i dont have a good bonus action i will  use my devils tongue ill use vicious mockery on the gnoll thats currently in between not the  one thats actually the one thats furthest from us because hes going to be the archer and in  infernal im going to say im too disgusted to think of anything clever  matt it rolled a natural one on its saving throw  taliesin so yeah thats three psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack  matt good to know now /none/ everyone please roll initiative  taliesin natural 20  sam natural 20 do i have to roll with disadvantage is this dex or intelligence  matt its technically a dexterity ability check so it would be disadvantage yeah  sam two so six  laura that is so sad  matt 25 to 20  taliesin 23  travis yes  matt fjord what did you get  travis four  matt sorry so who else rolled a natural 20  sam i did but i got a disadvantage  matt right yeah but dont you have advantage with  /none/ sam on stealth  matt just on stealth checks thats right so mollys up first thats a fun

oh so no  matt sorry  taliesin coughs and im holding  matt all right thats /none/ your turn all right the gnolls are up first these two here are going to  pull out their bow and begin to fire at beau since you had been the first to appear at this  point and gather their attention they both have disadvantage on the attacks that is going to be  an 11  marisha miss  matt the other is two 14s in a row so it would be 18 to hit  marisha oh hit with disadvantage  matt 17 to hit sorry  marisha hit  matt yeah all right  marisha 17 /none/ is my armor class  matt that would be  marisha this is with a bow  matt yep thats going to be ten points of piercing damage to you  marisha im going to catpaw try to catch the missile with deflect missiles what do i spend  oh wait oh no wait this is a ki point  matt well its a ki point to throw it back  marisha oh no its a ki point to throw it back its just a reaction its 1d10 plus seven nine  plus seven so 16  matt you catch /none/ it in midair and reduce it to no damage  travis fucking dope  marisha i hold it out like a microphone and go  matt as you do that the one in the bottom of the ground who is closest to you grabs its  spear off the side of the wall growling runs up the stairs  taliesin does it hit the ball bearings  matt thats what im  taliesin oh okay  matt rolling its dexterity check to see if it can do so it does succeed its a 15 it slips but  it manages /none/ to make its way up the stairs  marisha i laugh at it as it comes at me  laura he looks so stupid  matt coming into combat with both fjord and beau hes going to go ahead and reach out at you with  that its going to be a 16  marisha miss  matt 16 misses  liam i hope we at least heard the looney tunes bongos bongo noises  matt after you drop the arrow it comes up and you parry this one off to the side and go back  into your defensive /none/ stance that ends both of thoses go there now comes to caleb  liam yeah i can see from where i am i can see fjord and beau with one of these things im going  to fire bolt right from where i am  matt all right go for it roll for attack  liam thats it aw no  travis aw no  matt it strikes part of the stone altar splintering candle wax and pieces of remnant heart  chunks but no impact unfortunately on the actual gnoll  liam sorry  matt you going to stay /none/ where you are  liam yeah i will walk just inside the  laura did you go beau  marisha i havent but we rolled at the same time  matt right so beau you want to go with your action now  marisha yes im going to take my staff im going to try and crack this guy on the back of his  head where he is  matt go for it  marisha jesus christ alfuckingmighty 13 does that hit  matt as you swing the bo back trying to crack him in the head it actually /none/ slips on one of the  ball bearings you had left and as it manages to catch itself it falls out of range of your sweep  of the bo youre like shit  marisha im my own worst enemy im going to do a knee and a round kick oh no sorry i can  just do one im thinking in advance one kick with the knee  matt all right go for the attack  travis damn  laura do you want my dice bag  matt you slip on one of your own ball bearings on the /none/ second strike and manage to catch yourself by  grabbing the fur on the outside of the gnoll and using its body to right yourself and then ugh  its a little slick and sticky  marisha i wipe my hand on fjord really quick  matt all right jester youre up  laura okay have any of them been hurt yet  matt that are standing this one has been hurt a little bit  laura okay im going to move my spiritual weapon over to the one on the ground directly in front  of beau oh i /none/ meant on the lower level yeah and its going to hit him whoa 16 plus five  matt 16 hits plus five hits even more  laura thats nine points of force damage  matt nine points of force damage as the lollipop hits it in the back of the skull and it leans forward  and grabs the back of its skull with this pounding throbbing pain in its head  laura and then im going to use toll the dead on the one in front of beau  matt all righty so what does it have to roll /none/  laura he has to roll a wisdom saving throw  matt okay and the range of that one is  laura 60 feet  matt so that rolls a nine plus zero nine  laura yeah so he takes 1d12 necrotic damage two its a little bell this time  matt just a little bell you watch as a little bit of blood comes out the side one of the hyenas ears  taliesin i like to think that your lollipop makes candy crush sounds when it hits people  liam jester is the lollipop the flat kind or /none/ the round kind  laura im picturing the flat kind so it can whack  matt so the spiral kind gotcha are you going to move at all or are you going to stay where you are  laura im going to stay right there  matt okay that ends your turn  laura and then i make my mirror images be like i guess theyre doing that because im doing that  because theyre my mirror images  matt there you go there is a whole dance number over there of multiple jesters the hyenas go now  travis /none/ sings tune to single ladies  liam thats the best  matt does succeed on his dex save this ones going to attempt  travis singing if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it  matt leaps up to there dexterity saving throw does succeed  laura oh jeez theres a lot of them thats a bigger one it looks like  matt succeeds theyre actually rolling pretty high for their saving throws this  one will be a three that one does not make it this one gets partway over and then falls prone /none/  there uses the other half of its movement to get up but thats as far as it can get it cant  actually attack for this round its going to use its movement to make the rest of its run up to the top  of the stairs so that one does not get an action this turn because it slipped on the ball bearings  its going to be one attack against beau  marisha whoa it was effective  matt with disadvantage thats a natural 20 and a six  marisha yeah  matt yeah that does /none/ not hit not at all its plus two the hyena rushes up and lashes out  towards you and you just pop slap it in the nose and it pulls back  marisha nose punch  matt yep the two other ones that rush up and come along the flank with the hyena to you fjord  first one goes that is going to be a 15 plus two 17  travis that will hit  matt all right actually it has advantage on the roll because of pack tactics it didnt really  help lets see here you take /none/ two points of piercing damage  travis okay  matt the other one is going to attack you  travis it will take ten points of cold damage in return  matt laughs which causes it to shatter into ice on the ground it bites you and its snout  explosion t1000 style it shatters into a million ice pieces  taliesin you lost a gnoll there  matt yep  taliesin no youve got a gnoll you should have that looked at  matt thank you the other one is going to take a strike at you natural 20 /none/ its a critical hit 20  and ten that pack tactics is nasty that means you for dice wise suffer eight points of  piercing damage it takes ten and it explodes into ice as well both of these hyenas rush up and  strike and both in succession disintegrate into shards of ice across the ground  laura that is the coolest spell ever  taliesin its so hardcore  matt the spell is gone though right  travis thats it  matt thats going to end the hyenas turn nott youre up  sam okay ill lean out /none/ from behind mollymauks buttocks and rest the hand crossbow on his left  cheek and fire  taliesin i support  sam on the gnoll thats engaged with fjord  matt okay  sam firing eight  matt laughs as you drunkenly try and aim in the direction  sam its that bulbous butt  matt you almost pull the trigger twice but youre aiming at fjord and youre like no  taliesin no advantage for engagement  matt no advantage but he can sneak attack if he hits thats how it works you finally go and one  of /none/ the elements of stone in the side of the cavern wall impact as the bolt hits it and goes sideways  samam i still hidden no that exposes me do i have to hide again how do rogues work  matt yeah youre revealed  sam oh i was revealed okay so i have to hide again  matt you have to find a way to obscure somethings vision to you before you can hide  sam sure got it okay ill run up the stairs then and hide back near where caleb is other  side and then hide /none/  matt thatll work go ahead and roll a stealth check as your bonus  sam well ive cocked terrible nine plus eight is 17 oh wow im so stealthy  matt youre a rogue this goround man all right that ends notts turn fjord youre up  travis oh it is my turn can i use my bonus action to move my hex from my defeated foe to my  new foe right in front of me  matt you may  travis yeah and can i whip my falchion around and upstrike just try and cut right through /none/ him  matt go for it  marisha and travis singing i whip my falchion back and forth  travis thats only a 16  matt 16 hits  travis oh good  matt his acs 15  travis can i say twohanded  matt ill allow it  travis ive got to get in the habit of saying it  matt yeah youve got to say it twohanded ill allow it  travis 1d10 thats a ten four thats 14 points of damage plus a d6 thats 15 points of damage  matt so this one that had already /none/ 15 points of damage right  travis mmhmm  matt this is the one that you hit earlier with it as you swing with your falchion just spinning  it in your hand you arc upward as you do you watch as the gore and shadow of your hex which  now seems to grasp around its chest almost reaches out to meet the blade in the middle like  the two bits of lightning hitting in the center of the sky as they impact the blade carries through  the momentum the strength coming from the blade not from /none/ your actual body as you do you carve  through a large portion of its torso you watch as the hide armor folds off revealing this huge gash  wound in its chest it snarling and growling its still standing but its horribly wounded  now  travis you fucked with the wrong one son  matt that end your turn fjord  travis that does  matt all right to the top molly youre up  taliesin im going to run up to these two and join the fray up here  matt all righty  taliesin first im /none/ going to take a swing at the big guy  matt go for it  taliesin thats 16 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin and thats just using my normal one for this one thats eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage as soon as it rears from the attack fjord you watch as in a flash  the cloak billows of mollymauks arrival as the cloak falls you just watch as the gnolls head  just rolls off of its shoulders you can see the blow that struck it /none/  taliesin bonus action with the glowing sword goes down into the hyena  matt go for it  travis well hot damn  taliesin thats an 11 to hit  matt thats its armor class hyena doesnt have a whole lot of armor  taliesin all right and thats eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage with the one strike you turn around and look at the hyena whoosh  with the offhand and just carve right through it  travis with a flourish  matt wait because that didnt have the  taliesin no this /none/ one was the glowing one  matt well the glowing one is your main hand  taliesin oh it was my main hand  matt then your offhand is the other one  taliesin oh okay i didnt know how that  matt so what damage would it have been without the bonus  taliesin that would have been four  matt four damage all right so its still there you carve through and its wounded but its  still whimpering  taliesin i would have flipped them if id known  laura couldnt you have attacked with your offhand /none/ first  taliesin i was going to say i would have flipped them if i had known  matt you could have  taliesin i was going to hit the one that didnt have much left  matt the idea is the bonus action attack happens as part of the attack action  taliesin sure ill do it reverse next time  matt no worries you can keep that in mind next time its all good you still beat the shit out  of it with your offhand so that ends mollys turn those two gnolls in the back this /none/ guy is  going to back up as he attempts to make a dexterity save fails so he falls prone uses the  rest of his movement to get back up so he can only move ten more feet so he cant get that much  further away hes going to go ahead and take a shot this guy is going to go ahead and pull back  hes out of the bearing range and begins making his way towards the door  marisha no  matt theyre both going to take shots at fjord actually one at you one /none/ at molly theyre not  going to fire at you because you visibly caught one and dropped it in front of them like fuck that  marisha aw damn it  travis fuck that  matt against fjord thats going to be 19  travis oh that hits  matt and against molly  taliesin blood maledict on that fucker  matt okay that brings it down to a 14  taliesin yeah that dont hit  matt all right as the one that is going to fire at you molly pulls back its arrow its eyes suddenly go  /dung/ dark and begin to bleed from the inside it suddenly snarling and releases it and you watch  as that arrow splinters against the central column the one that does come towards you fjord  however does strike true you suffer eight points of piercing damage as this one catches you right  in the abdomen a little bit to the right tapping something kidneyish in that vicinity and you feel  this sudden dull pain and nausea overcome you thats going to end the gnolls turn caleb  youre up  liam i saw nott dart in front of /none/ me and chuckle to myself see nott walk past im going to walk  forward and say you are enjoying this too much but okay can i see these two you said they were  backing away correct  matt you can see this one this one is technically being blocked by that central column  liam all right then the diamond comes up i spin it and little charges of electricity crackle  around it and i kick it out from my hand and it spirals through the room to that one  matt go ahead and roll your /none/ spell attack  liam come on grog no  laura oh man caleb so rough tonight  travis as grog sorry  matt whatd you roll  liam two plus six is eight did that do it  matt no unfortunately  liam nein  matt it skitters off the central column and goes spinning out of control as the electrical sphere  shatters against the stonework and dissipates the energy absorbed by the surrounding stonework  liam but i was so eager that i actually came down the steps my full movement  taliesin ill also say i think /none/ we oh no thats right youre double  matt yeah that would be your full movement there pretty close  liam i dont want to go there i want to go to the bottom of the steps behind mollymauk and fjord  matt ending calebs turn beau  marisha right okay how far away is he im having a hard time seeing can i close the gap  matt you could say maybe hes about 30 feet from you  marisha okay can i do some cool monk shit and do some wall running and leap and parkour and then /none/  get to this guy  matt you can certainly try make an acrobatics check for me  marisha acrobatics  taliesin i can see this is going to end up with an office parkour gif in your future  marisha parkour oh thats good thats a natural 18 plus six  matt as you run off the edge the hyena takes a swing at you that is going to be a 14  marisha miss  matt you feel it snap at your heel but does not actually grasp any of your body  marisha my foot just taps /none/ his arm just a little bit and i leap off of his arm  matt you push off of him run across this wall leap hit this pillar and then using the momentum leap  and land right in front of the gnoll there  marisha as im leaping i want to take the staff and come down and go crack with a slap double  handed piece of shit gnoll oh god its a two  matt what was the other one  marisha that was my eightsided die im trying to efficient my rolls  matt roll both /none/ yeah as you swing down the gnoll manages to see you up in the air and side  steps as you hit the stonework  marisha i scream as i come down the whole way going screaming  matt gnoll laughter  marisha i just go pop and do a little jab okay thats an 18  taliesin you just slap him in the face  matt damage on that one  marisha thats just a d4 four so eight  matt eight points of damage nice as its laughing laughing punch growling its jaw is  dislocated and it /none/ snaps back into place you see some of its teeth broke it looks kind of dazed  and hurt by it its looking pretty rough its taken some hits in the past thats the end of  your turn  taliesin he cant run anymore  matt all right that brings us to jester  laura i say dont laugh at my friend and im going to send my lollipop over and hit it in the face  matt yeah thatll do it 20 feet  marisha get a good hit lollipop  laura i dont know if its going /none/ to hit it eight plus five  matt 13 no im afraid that will not hit as the lollipop comes around the corner it sees it  coming and moves to get beau to intercede between the lollipop and itself at that moment youre like  oh i cant quite and you end up withdrawing and not making the strike this round for fear of hitting beau  laura toll the dead  matt all righty so thats a wisdom save thats six no  laura yay okay seven  matt seven points of damage as you release the surge /none/ of energy the sound begins to vibrate  in its ears as it whimpering and it reaches up as both of its eardrums burst on the sides of its  head and it falls to one knee looking like its completely ruined and dazed and beau you have a  moment to coup de grâce it you whack and break its neck with one swoop of the bo combined you  both finish off that gnoll  marisha sounds great  taliesin thats so cool that spell is so cool  laura its pretty cool  marisha fuck yeah that /none/ was awesome  travis toll the dead is the bomb  matt jester you want to move  laura im going to hang out where i am  matt okay end of jesters turn the hyenas this hyena is going to move past  taliesin does fjord get an attack of opportunity on it  matt no that one was not in melee with him that ones going to move up to you fjord  attacking you fjord that is a six  travis no it doesnt hit thankfully  matt attacking you molly that is a 20  taliesin /none/ that hits  matt you take two points of piercing damage as it snaps at you seeing that theyre both beginning  to glance about and see that their allies are starting to back away and theres a lot of you up  in this upper area theyre both going to attempt to break away with the rest  taliesin im definitely going to take an attack of opportunity on that one  travis id like to as well  matt yep both of you do  laura we got to get that last gnoll before he leaves the room /none/  taliesin 14  travis 21  matt both hit roll damage  taliesin is this main hand  matt main hand this one is hanging on by a thread its the one you damaged last round  taliesin eight points of damage  matt yeah you carve that one you  travis 11 points  matt as theyre rushing you both whoosh simultaneously strike back at it as theyre  attempting to flee and they stumble down the stairs  travis can we cheers swords  taliesin and travis tink  matt perfect their bodies stumble to the ground /none/ and end up its weird because their bodies hit  the ground and the momentum carries them as they slide across the ball bearings almost like  theyre lagging  marisha bad physics  travis whats that kerning curling  matt finished the hyenas round nott youre up  sam seeing the gnolls expression i know it well its one of fear and about to run away  laughter  matt make an insight check  sam okay  taliesin at disadvantage  sam 19  matt it is not disadvantage on wisdom checks 19 this gnoll looks like its /none/ ready to fucking bolt  it is on the way out of the room the tide has turned its starting to see more and more of you  appear at the top of the stairs as the hyenas and its friends are being destroyed its going to run  sam okay im going to put the hand crossbow up and run as fast as i can straight at it using my  bonus action to dash im going to say to it hey you if you spend all day in a well well thats a  day wellspent ill cast /none/ hideous laughter on it  laughter  laura im glad we still get shitty jokes  matt it immediately goes cackling and falls on the ground on its back and is now rolling with  laughter laughter that is echoing through the halls and making its way through the tunnel  sam dont you worry fjord kill him  travis you made it prone its harder to hit that way  sam get closer  travis im trying i would like to move up my 30 feet of speed  marisha i turn behind me i go watch the ball /none/ bearings watch the marbles  matt make a dexterity saving throw  marisha shit  matt as you hear that just as you reach the bottom of the stairs  travis 13  matt okay you get to the bottom of the stairs and you barely begin to slip and catch yourself  its a dc 12 however you continue to run counting thats about as close as you can get on  your 30 movement  travis can i use my bonus action to move my hex to the laughing gnoll on the ground  matt yes you may /none/  travis ill cast eldritch blast at it  matt actually make a concentration check youve taken some damage and i forgot to maintain your  hexs concentration  travis oh thats right saving throw  matt make two for me if you dont mind  travis this first one is a 19  matt correct thats fine  travis the second one is 18  matt yeah youre fine the hex moves over  travis ill remember that  matt whenever you take damage and you have a spell thats concentration you have to  travis these spell rules /none/  matt i know  travis 14  matt eldritch blast  travis yes oh sorry plus six  matt disadvantage because its still prone  travis thats even higher so 14  matt 14 still misses unfortunately it hits and gleans off of its armor however it isnt quite  strong enough to actually make a painful impact on its body and slams into the nearby rock causing a  spray of dust and debris  travis the attack has to hit for hex to work right  matt correct all right that ends your turn fjord molly youre /none/ up  taliesin im going to run down the stairs the opposite direction from the ball bearings ill  see where i can get if i can get 30 feet  matt thats as far as you can get right there  taliesin im going to also use vicious mockery again and yell shut up already  matt that actually is a 16 whats your dc  taliesin dc on that it just says wisdom saving  matt right against whatever your spell dc is  taliesin where is my spell dc well its weird im not a spell  /none/ matt spellcaster technically we will say for the purposes of this its eight plus proficiency  bonus which is ten plus whatever your charisma modifier is  taliesin my charisma modifier is zero  sam yuck  matt yeah not a big deal for now well tighten it up cool so no effect there mollys turn is  over the gnolls turn it is laughing its ass off now does it make  sam the end of its turn it makes a save  matt all right which is a 17 it manages to shrug off the laughter  sam /none/ at the end of its turn  laura oh so it cant get up and move  matt no its just on the ground going confused whimpering its about to try and get back up  caleb youre up  liam im going to go along the edge of the steps this way and come down toward it and im going to  now spin and flames lick around it and ill go flick and i flick that off my hand this time is  also not good it is a 13  matt 13 it has disadvantage because its /none/ still prone  liam oh for my attack  matt yes against ranged spells  liam same thing rolled the same thing  matt yeah you release it and it just skids across the ground like skipping a stone across a  lake it slams into the wall behind it and explosion  travis i apologize  liam no its okay no i dont believe in any of that bullshit you all are crazy  matt its all good man just survive to level five and everything will turn unfortunately it  does not hit  liam no dont worry /none/ about me keep going everybody attack  matt all right beau youre up  marisha i want to do this as my twohanded attack but for flavor to skin it i want to  stroll up channeling the rock charge up the elbow then we go a peoples elbow come right down  matt you have advantage because it is prone  marisha just a full body weight thudding with advantage can i consider it a twohanded attack  matt youre just getting your attack so yeah still with advantage  marisha oh my god why  liam two and /none/ a three  matt heres what you do you walk up tap tap leap and right as youre in the air the gnoll  kicks out of laughter rolls out of the way and you wham  marisha yelling in pain  liam never recover from that injury  travis yep that shit just hangs out in there  matt the worst funny bone pain shoots through your arm as you get up  liam you are going to be rubbing tiger balm into that shit for years  matt you still have your bonus the gnoll actually starts laughing /none/ again  marisha for flavor my second attack isnt really an attack im in so much pain i go yell and i  kick a little bit  matt roll the attack you still have advantage yeah because its still prone  marisha natural 20  matt that will shut it up  laura i like that your revenge hits are always really high thats twice now that theyve  laughed at you and youve hit them while theyre laughing at you  marisha every time i try to show off it never works thats what im learning okay three /none/  doubled to six plus four so ten  matt so as its laughing you kick it in the head and you see it stunned on the ground for a second  and its eyes kind of rolling in different directions nice heavy crack to the side of its temple  marisha i dont care too much i just roll over and go fetal for a minute  matt okay ending beaus turn jester youre up  laura im going to skip over across the upper level towards the far stairs so i can see it im  going to /none/ send my spiritual weapon over to it and smack it flat on the ground  matt okay that does have advantage because it is technically in melee with it  laura jesus christ i dont think either of them hit 13 and lower  matt nope its just rolling out of the way of everything its doing what beau did in the last  fight but on the ground  laura then im going to toll the dead wisdom  matt unless it rolls a natural 19  taliesin this is amazing  matt this one gnoll is just holding /none/ on so hard jester i think that ends your turn unfortunately  laura jesus fucking christ  laughter  matt the hyenas are dead theres no hyenas left  travis the pronedout gnoll is just making it through  marisha come on nott bring it home  laura im going to sit down on the ground and all my mirror images do the exact same thing  matt you watch as four shimmering jesters all kneel down and shake their heads in their hands  beau is over there going gasps  marisha its almost something like a jacobs ladder /none/ moment the end of his life is being  stretched out  matt this gnoll is going to need some serious therapy nott youre up  sam i cant believe this thing is still alive its still prone right  matt its prone yeah so melee attacks have advantage  sam so i walk up to it and then pointblank shoot not pointblank but far enough away that  matt youre at disadvantage with a ranged attack  sam all right ill stand back ten feet  taliesin no youll still get disadvantage  matt you have disadvantage from a /none/ ranged attack up close and disadvantage against a prone  creature right now with your crossbow its disadvantage regardless  sam oh well shit then i will draw a sword and i will  travis slap that bitch  taliesin now youve got advantage  matt now you have advantage on the attack  travis get your hands dirty  sam thank god okay 18  matt 18 hits go ahead and roll damage with your sneak attack  sam okay 13  matt 13 points of damage how do you want to do this  cheers  sam i /none/ think since its on the ground i would like to pin it into the ground if i can by  finding the thinnest thing on it and jamming my shortsword into the ground  matt as its cackling and moving around i like to imagine this is all happening simultaneously  beaus on the ground holding her elbow the weapon misses and its rolling and cackling and starting  to get up and youre like hmm there thump almost unceremoniously its like dying yip and  falls limp on the ground where you place it its almost like the slow /none/ push from saving private  ryan youre like shh shh shh  laura youre terrible  matt dying yips and it expires there on the ground  laura i go around and i collect the gnoll ears and i put them in the jar  liam as the room falls still i say well he had a good run a toast to that guy right there on the ground  sam yes  taliesin cheers  sam he was like beyoncé he was one hot knowles  laughter and groaning  sam i dont know  travis one point of /none/ damage all of us  matt everyone takes one point of psychic damage  laura i have a question how similar do hyena ears look to gnoll ears  matt they are noticeably smaller and not gnoll ears  laura what if we said they were baby gnolls im going to cut them off just to be safe  matt okay five sets of gnoll ears and four sets of hyena ears  liam im going to call nott over to the chest over on that side there do you see anything wrong  with this is there anything hinky /none/ about that chest  sam i check for traps checking for traps  matt all right  sam this is an intelligence check  travis are you still intoxicated  liam its investigation i think  travis or has that shit worn off with some activity  matt the next ten to 15 minutes or so youll be able to shake off the alcohol  sam for now i rolled an 11  matt okay it does not appear to be trapped  sam its good  liam does it look good  sam its totally good  liam take /none/ a step back youve earned this i will open it just in case  matt clunk its locked  liam oh  sam i will pick it  matt okay go ahead and attempt with disadvantage to pick it  sam what am i rolling  matt its proficiency bonus which is two plus your dex bonus  sam okay proficiency and dex but disadvantage okay 21  matt as the adrenaline pumps through your system it wakes you up a bit and even with the  intoxication thats been flooding your system you steal a moment of clarity and /none/ it opens without an  issue you glance at it and the chest looks like its been bashed in a little bit like one of the  gnolls was trying to get into it and eventually gave up got flummoxed and threw it on the  ground as you open it up from the inside you can see essentially a central medical pack if you  will an emergency pack for any of the miners that had gotten hurt or wounded there are two healers  kits in there there are a number of disinfectant herbs and funguses anybody who /none/ is proficient in  medicine would know how best to utilize those i dont know if any of you are  travis nope  matt then its a risky endeavor to maybe use one you do find a small leather hand pack that  contained four glass vials three of which were shattered from the rough movements when it was  tossed around but one that is still intact that contains a healing potion  sam is it a healing potion  matt it is it is a greater healing potion not a standard healing potion  laura whoa  /none/ sam i hand it to caleb you need this more than all of us youre the squishiest  liam well thats probably true thank you you take the two medicine packs and then  sam what do i do with these i dont all right fine ill take them i collect medicine packs now  laura i need them i could probably use those  taliesin i also like the idea of maybe giving the healing potion to the healer  liam she can heal without the potion  taliesin can you heal yourself without the potion  liam of /none/ course she can  taliesin oh well all right then that didnt really occur to me  sam ill keep the herbs  matt you can mark down medicinal supplies would be what youd call it you are not entirely certain  as to how they are applied but they are probably healthy  laura can i look at them since im proficient in medicine  matt youre proficient in medicine yeah i was asking if anyone was proficient with it  laura oh sorry i was writing down gnoll sets of ears  matt laughs fair enough the medicinal /none/ supplies you have acquired can be utilized to remove  poisons if quickly applied to where the poison was put it has two uses if an action is taken to  apply it to a wound whether a bite or a wound that was poisoned it can help remove the poison  travis oh shit  laura its an action you said  matt its an action to apply it yeah  liam there was a lot of gnoll chatter in here and a lot of exploding orbs and stuff so im  going to guess that we have alerted /none/ whatever is beyond that we are here how do we wish to proceed  taliesin well they make a lot of noise they may not have noticed  marisha can i since im in that general vicinity go 20 or so feet into this hole and  listen and see if i hear anything  liam they dont send orbs of fire through the air though  matt as you step forward a little bit make a perception check  laura what was the question im sorry  travis there was no question  marisha 13  matt you hear /none/ echoing muffled in the distance some yipping some conversation in whatever this  gnollish language is you hear a deep resonant deep breathing and a distant thump an impact  and a sound near yips thats all sounded quite a ways away like this echo had been traveling a  ways down this tunnel  marisha i bend down  matt you hear a few other cackling chuckles that echo shortly thereafter  marisha i turn around and come back to the rest of the group and say theres something bigger  travis jester could you give me a heal /none/ a little bit i took a little bit of a beating  laura oh sure yeah ill cast cure wounds on him  marisha i think theres something bigger at play here whatever is driving these gnolls i think is  deeper in can i look around and see if i can find anything like any papers anything from that  humanoid that might be intelligible  matt make an investigation check please  marisha okay 20 total  matt okay looking about the altar you find some smaller pieces of fresher flesh that have been  stretched over the /none/ edges of the altar like on the corners you can see a similar grin across the  center its all blood splattered from the hearts that were placed on there as you wipe a little  bit of it away you can see stained into this loosely tanned human skin the same symbol of the  jagged smile the jagged teeth that form a grin that the various tanned banners that are stapled  into the stone walls show and reveal but no notes no books no parchment  marisha can i try and figure out what this is if /none/ i recognize this symbol in any way  taliesin id also like to join in on that with a religion check  matt youve already made a religion check before and as you come up and join her this particular  symbol the grin matches the memory the flash you had of this entity  marisha yeenogru  laura yeah yeenoghu  marisha yeenoghu  matt you gather this is probably the symbol that represents this entity  taliesin the cult of yeenogru  laura yeenogru or yeenoghu  marisha yeenoghu or what  matt and marisha yeenoghu  taliesin /none/ mr magoo well you know fake confidence  liam are you clear now  sam im fine  liam how many fingers am i holding up  sam more than i think i have on my entire body i think i just have four on each hand  liam and thumbs or  laughter  liam you good do we need to get out of here  sam yeah im good were fine i mean is this the plan we were supposed to free living people  but we got some arms we could bring those back  liam i /dung/ dont think i mean yeah we could but  laura he did say to bring back anything we could find  sam are there any identifiable body parts  matt you take a few minutes to look around which gives you two notifications one nothing seems to  be immediately coming in to search as to what the noises were and you do hear other distant sounds  impacts and cackling and stuff you get the sense that the tunnels deeper in have some activity  amongst the gnolls that live below whatever theyve converted this mine network to be /none/ you  also see that all the bodies in this chamber have been pretty much picked of any identifiable facets  marisha jewelry wedding bands anything  matt if you want to take some time to really pick through it you could try do you want to  liam no were still trying to get to people here our options are we press forward to  something worse or we backtrack and try the other direction or we get out of here  travis we have the silver thread up top right  sam did we do that  liam /none/ did we no we opted not to do that for times sake  laura we could do it now as we move forward  travis oh it took a few minutes didnt it  liam yeah we could do that now  taliesin how are you feeling fjord  sam yeah fjord are we going to be fjord explorers or fjord escapes  laura jesus  liam yeah i could do that quickly i could put an alarm here quickly i could do it the fast way  and know if anything is coming behind us is that what we /none/ want to do do we want to go around i  dont know im a little terrified of what is down there  marisha while he does that can we no we cant take a short rest its not enough time  matt thats up to you  liam thats a half hour is a short rest or an hour is a short rest  matt its about an hour or so  marisha nope ignore what i said  liam theres two ways that i can do this i can do it licketysplit or i can take my book /none/ out and  do it the harder way but thats ten minutes about  travis i think its in front of us  marisha theres something real big back there its real big  liam we just have to march into it okay  taliesin im not convinced that they dont still have people alive down there  laura im pretty much out of spells now but thats okay  travis a short rest doesnt get us spells back does it  matt not for her it doesnt singing conservation  liam how are you with that sledgehammer on your /none/ back  laura what do you mean  liam youre carrying a sledgehammer on your back  laura yeah  liam how are you with it  laura oh i dont know its a big weapon  marisha shes got a badass scythe  matt its more of a tool sledgehammer than a weapon sledgehammer  laura yeah ive got a scythe a sickle  travis id like to volunteer that perhaps we move forward until we can see whether there are any  living people that we can help and we make a decision then  marisha i saw /none/ nothing that would clue me in as to what might be deeper and really big  matt nothing that caught your attention  marisha okay lets go  travis that went far better than the village but also that big armored bastard wasnt there  taliesin lets make a pile of these bodies too just in case maybe they think that they took each  other apart  laura lets set them up like they all were making out  liam no we dont have time for that here we have to get going  sam like some sort of /none/ a circlejerky sort of a thing  laura yeah yeah  taliesin on the way out  laura loosely prop them up like that  liam when were victorious we can do disgusting things as we leave nott i think you should take  point again  sam all right  laura did you do the  liam that i thought that was for going back the other way we want to know if something comes  behind us  laura yeah  liam the reasons for doing that are slighter and i dont want to blow my wad magically /tavern/  laura okay  liam if we were going the other way i might  taliesin i agree  laura lets go and be really smart and do this  sam am i drunk or am i not drunk  matt if you were to take about ten more minutes youd stop being drunk  liam we talked for seven minutes yeah  taliesin all right  sam all right wait for three more minutes and then go  matt okay so you want to wait until nott shakes off the  travis the booze  matt the influence the /none/ booze eventually you regain  marisha while we wait for those three minutes i turn to molly and i say do you remember anything  in your recollections of this yeeahnoghu  laura and marisha yeenoghu  taliesin yoplait  marisha uhhuh yoplait is a female deity or a male deity do you remember  taliesin its hard to remember its a lot of aggression anger  marisha im wondering with that whole you know  liam why are you curious about that  marisha well the guy the guy running the ceremony said that the hunger will be fed /none/ ours  and hers right i mean thats what he said right dm i didnt mishear that  matt yes  taliesin do i remember anything about either gender or that this would be other than  i just saw a lot of aggression and a feral aspect of this  matt that was it yeah  marisha i just wonder who hers is who is that  liam that is the crux of the matter  marisha yeah  taliesin shall we go find out  travis yep  matt as you guys are having this conversation you hear /none/ one sound that varies very strongly from  the others that have encompassed this tunnel sequence you hear this female scream this  highpitched shrieking scream that says no my baby  laura oh no this is what happens when we sit down and we talk  travis we got to go cant fuck around with mama deaths  laura were moving forward as quickly as possible  sam i charge ahead
