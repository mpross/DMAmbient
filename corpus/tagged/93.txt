their way south absconding  from the tensions of the north dwendalian empire to seek a few possible threads of mystery to the  south shores and coasts of the menagerie coast you made your way through the wuyun gorge  purchased a few pets and then eventually found yourselves for many of you your first time at  the beach at the coast seeing an ocean seeing /none/ the waves seeing the sand and took a brief bit  of time to relish in that experience eventually making your way to nicodranas in time for the  sunset across the western ocean you began to notice the workforce that goes through the day and  dwindles to the night that works alongside the numerous number of ships that come in and then  stay along the wharf and the various docks in the vicinity you made your way through the not very  stealthy but were not in character yet so ill allow it you made your way /town/ throughout various  districts of the city eventually meeting the fantastic and longpresented mother of jester the  ruby of the sea marion lavorre after having some time to catch up with her exchange information  about your travels you discovered that there had been some issues with one client of hers in the  town and managed to gather a little bit of information but began to seek more about this  algar this figure who had grown jealous of other clientele and seemed to be becoming a point of  concern for marion you took it upon yourselves /town/ to look into this individual and find a way to  possibly resolve this while you were in town you also began to run into some other curious  mysteries you went to the lighthouse and spoke with the lighthouse keeper there for a bit you  had found a strange tower in the open quay  travis fucked up  matt laughs then eventually discovered along the wharf a tavern with a familiar name based on  some of the previous things you were keeping an eye out for the wayfarers cove you had just  stepped into the /tavern/ darkened interior of this the smell of old wet wood combined with the dried  liquors and ales that had long stained the various tables and floorboards of this dank and relatively  musty bar looking across the clientele a few interesting persons caught your attention and  thats where we left off so mighty nein as you begin to enter this darkened torchlit interior  lantern i would say slowly hanging from various portions of the ceiling crossbeams the bits of  wind that push them causing them to slightly shift and have this shifting crackle of firelight  /none/ within the chamber what do you wish to do  travis ive never seen a i mean ive seen one but ive never spoken to a  marisha turtle person  travis yeah  marisha yeah pretty coollooking i dont think ive ever actually saw one either ive only seen pictures  travis is that an eye patch

things coming out of the shell green tubes  laura are you a turtle  matt do you walk up and approach him  laura yeah im a shithead  travis were all going to fight  matt sitting there on the table both these large scaled coming to the point of these hooked  claws these hands are wrapped around this heavy tankard the head shifts over your direction where  the eye patch meets your gaze first before the other eye creeps past the extending hard brow  im sorry what you asking eh  laura i /none/ was asking how you got your eye patch did you did somebody shoot it out of your eye  matt well tthats certainly a possibility cher  laura you dont remember  matt you dont think that perhaps someones going to tell you their life story just without  even knowing you you can buy me a drink first  laura oh yeah i will buy you a drink if you tell me how your eyeball went missing  matt very well  sam ask him what he wants  laura what oh do you not want milk do you /tavern/ want something else  matt sighs he raises one of his fingers up towards the bar and the bartender glances up oh  another round okay he turns around and begins preparing what looks to be another drink lowers  his hand and claw which scrapes across the wood and leaves this little curl of little shaving  that is put to the side as his hand comes to rest looking back at you with his one eye how about  this then lets trade a story huh  laura okay  matt yyou tell me where youre from and /town/ why it brought you in to my table then mmaybe ill tell  you how i lost this yeah  laura okay well im from up the street kind of im the daughter of the ruby of the sea do you  work for any government officials  matt laughs no  laura im the daughter of the ruby of the sea and you know these are my friends and weve gotten  into a lot of hijinks and um what all did you want to know  matt drink gets brought down to the table dont worry shes going /none/ to take care of it  laura yes do you have money to take care of it  sam sure

other than milk please  matt okay well for a round of drinks and the milks involved as well thatll put you well say  at about two silver  laura its also possible that we /none/ met my dad earlier and we didnt know it  matt im going to be perfectly honest that was a lot mmore than i was asking but i appreciate it  laura okay i appreciate you too how did you get those pipes on your back  laughter  matt he turns and you hear the creaking of leather as the long extended neck turns the folds  of skin pushing against themselves oh this got this here on sea maybe about six or seven years ago  travis oh boy laughs  liam what do they do  matt /tavern/ he reaches back and you can see its interesting because on the right side of the shell  it looks like elements have been carved through where these pipes have been put in on the back on  the front theres a small deflated pouch of leather and a small extended tube of metal he  lifts it with one hand and breathes into it and it inflates a bit and inflates a bit you see his one  eye look around mischievously to everyone else at the bar and goes i mean yyou asked  terrible bagpipe wails this /none/ trio of bagpipes begin blasting out of these large almost  shellsculpted pipes that curve out of his shell and everyone in the room just immediately starts  grabbing their ears going ah and start throwing things over clanking off of his shell  travis oh my god fake bagpipe sound is best bagpipe sound  laughter  taliesin what is happening i dont know anymore  sam hes so good that was good  matt only a few notes in because while hes mischievously enjoying the moment of shattering  the calm and chill in the chamber hes not /none/ going to get himself thrown out so he stops and goes  that theres how i keep the other shipmates entertained  marisha entertained yeah  sam its a very good skill youre quite talented really  taliesin whats your typical rank on board ship if you dont mind me asking  matt its been a number of mmmonths since i found me a good ship and a purpose out there on  the ocean sea but ive been known to be a rather decent second mate and navigator  taliesin very cool  laura is your name marius

some reason  travis you say its been a few months since your last passage on a ship steady work  sam did he slip into it  travis did i  laura you started sliding  laughter  travis grunts stay away stay away southern accent trying to texas georgia louisiana  laughter  marisha just go on a little walkabout  travis were looking for an individual that might frequent these parts halfelf gentleman you seen  anyone /none/ named sabian in these parts  matt cant say that i have there son my apologies however youre mmmore than welcome to  ask around im sure theres a whole mighty spectrum of curious travelers that come in and out  of here  travis have you not been on a ship because of a lack of opportunity or if the right situation  presented itself you would be perhaps up for a bit of work  matt more the latter than the former i got to jive with the right crew more like they got to  jive with /none/ me i mean and he does this imafuckingtortle physicality to it  laura its the bagpipes isnt it  matt well theyre an acquired taste id say perhaps cherie  sam judging by your physique though you must be quite excellent on the water  matt yeah id say so  sam im sure youre an asset to any vessel now that ive buttered you up how about have you  ever heard of marius lepual  matt why you asking  sam oh  matt if i mmight inquire  sam well as one green to another we were /none/ just told that he might be around and he has some  information that we were looking for we are actually trying to deliver him a bit of correspondence  matt make a persuasion check  sam oh that will go over great ooh minus three oh no persuasion is at zero how did that  happen anyway its 13  laura youre proficient  sam oh im proficient at persuasion wow who knew  travis oh shit  matt i can say ive seen him around occasionally the boy has needed a place to crash  and ive provided /none/ my shack my abode when hes been drinking too hard or comes in with some sort  of a mmark on his face  sam youre roommates with marius  matt only in occasionally  sam oh  laura have you seen him lately  matt nnot in a few days no  laura do you know where he went  matt dont pay attention dont care none  travis do you frequent spots outside of this particular establishment or is this your shithole  of choice  matt you see him getting guarded the more you start asking about /none/ marius a little bit caduceus  you specifically as youre watching this you get the sense that hes offered up a little bit of  information but that little bit seems to have caused him to reel in hes being guarded and  doesnt seem very forthcoming though he passes it off as a lack of information  taliesin i apologize if were anxious we just want to get our business concluded as quickly as  possible and move on to more pressing matters i mean if you see marius or know that hes around  youre welcome to tell /none/ him that people are trying to deliver something i get the impression that  hes a friend and i also get the impression that hes probably used to a fair bit of trouble and  were hoping not to be trouble  matt you said something about a delivery  taliesin well its complicated im not even going to pretend that i entirely understand it  myself were  laura its a present it was a present for him  matt theres a shifting to orly at which point the last of the air in the small pouch gets pushed /none/  in and it wailing bagpipes slowly comes to rest  taliesin again i hate to ask personal questions but  liam makes farting sound with chair  laughter  taliesin bastard have you ever sailed with marius by any chance i mean do you have an  impression of him as a sailor or  matt laughs mmmarius aint really what youd call seatrekking folk more of a slimy shadow  word peddler however last time i saw him not but maybe a week ago i recall he was complaining  waiting on something to be delivered never found /none/ its way around was getting real that boy owes a  lot of money  taliesin ill have to say that we might be the answer hes looking for were removed from the  actual situation were more delivery by happenstance more than anything else we have our  own questions and problems and concerns which can only be answered by someone who has a better grasp  of the situation  matt make a persuasion check  travis fucking talking cow over here it was great  taliesin i know people and turtles  laura ooh  taliesin wow /none/ persuasion  matt yeah  taliesin 21  matt 21 orly looks you straight with his one good eye glances up and down you get a good  look the leather eye patch itself has its own carving into it like it was wettened at one point  and then shaved to have a very similar pattern as the curling wave tattoos that match his upper arms  and you can now see the backs and sides of his neck looking through you for a moment goes  taliesin sipping my milk milk mustache  laughter  matt let me /none/ tell you something if what you say is true it could very well be that you and your  friends here might have a way of taking some of the weight off of mmmarius i havent seen him  in some time but i do know sometimes he hangs around the docks at night round mmmidnight  sometimes hes meeting folks in ships and selling things i can only imagine is illegal sometimes  hes picking things up  taliesin you wouldnt mind me asking for a brief description of him so we can identify him when we  see /none/ him that would be most advantageous  matt what you looking for skinnyass little halfelf fellow sides of his head shaved real low  tiny little fuzz  taliesin super cool  matt with a big old flop of blonde hair hangs around in front of the face  taliesin thats pretty cool  matt other than that he dont dress mmmighty rich or anything tends to stay out of sight so  maybe be best you keep a keen eye around the shadows huh  taliesin sure i imagine hes probably a little jumpy of people if he owes /none/ money and that sort of  thing that can make someone very mistrusting i would hate to invoke your name in front of him but  matt if all goes well and you end up doing him a solid dont be afraid to tell him that orly put  you in the right direction huh  taliesin thanks friend thats great  matt if not dont say a fucking word  taliesin oh of course not  sam exaggerated cajun accent well be very careful we guarantee  laughter  travis yes  matt scratches the bottom of the chin /tavern/ looking

there minding his own  business staring at his own drink though now hes glaring over this large group thats  conversing after /dung/ blowing bagpipes in the middle of his previously solitary afternoon theres a  woman probably late 40s early 50s or so with a very big mass of hair that goes from a dark brown  to a gray to white at the tips almost like a mane dark skin looks weathered from lots of  travel and probably seen quite a bit in her day a light brown coat that hangs over the edge of the  chair shes sitting in theyre all looking at you guys because you all come storming in here cause

business is better i dont know why im focused on that other eye /none/ im stuck in  that i just noticed that no its good she was leaning this way  taliesin youve had your creole  matt i know and its a problem already she goes ive seen it ive certainly gazed and seen  that weird tower i think thats what youre referring to  travis indeed  liam do you live in these parts or are you just passing

dark silhouette against the bright sun in the sky behind you see /none/ over one  shoulder some sort of large sack that has been thrown over and held with one arm the other sits  at the side with a sword sheathed across that shoulder stepping into the light you see the  familiar and somewhat surprised face of yasha ashley if you want to jump in here if you dont mind  all cheering  ashley

idea who that is  ashley i have no idea who that is  marisha but he has a douchebag sounding name right  ashley yeah that sounds i dont even remember it algar al gore  liam oh no im still struck by the fact that you have walked into this tavern where we are it  means something  laura its fate  liam is what im saying  laura its the traveler  sam or maybe its the ball thing the dodeca maybe it brings us all /none/ together maybe its  special in some way  marisha sisterhood of the traveling dodecahedron  travis gross  laura maybe  marisha seriously though are you okay after everything we didnt really leave on the most  positive of terms  ashley ill be okay ive had to work through some things speaking of it looks like you have a  new member already in the group  marisha well were not replacing molly  laura or you  taliesin we didnt really talk much last time you were in your own space  travis we didnt really get /none/ to explain you were the last to wake up of the three of us and by the  time you came around we had met mr clay he apparently worked in a graveyard cemetery i want  to get it right  liam ja he was crucial in us getting the three of you out  ashley well thank you im sure we couldve made it if we had more time but thank you for helping  taliesin well here you are  ashley yes here i am  taliesin i think perhaps its destiny do you believe in destiny /none/  ashley no  taliesin but you dream about islands and you go to them  travis oh fucking shit  sam he does this a lot yasha  ashley i dont know if i like you  taliesin i know i like you  sam go with it open up and hell read into your inner thoughts thats his power  marisha you should try some of his dead tea its pretty good  ashley your dead tea what is a dead tea  travis he makes tea out of dead people i know like it sounds  ashley /none/ what is it does it taste good im not opposed to such things i have a fine palate  taliesin let me see you eat a meal then ill figure out what tea to give you  ashley oh okay sounds like a plan  travis how did the vision of these islands come to you  ashley well they come in my dreams as most of my visions have its the way that i commune with  the stormlord and i dont know im trying to find some purpose for all this i guess  travis the stormlord  /none/ ashley no i mean the purpose of all  travis you commune with the stormlord the stormlord  ashley at least i think i am  travis thats significant  marisha i dont have any dreams at night you guys is that worrisome  sam you probably do but you just dont remember them  marisha is that the deal  sam you can sleep with crystals to have a more vivid experience when you dream  laura keep a dream journal  marisha i dont think thats true oh dream journals i think are true  sam tonight when /none/ it looks like youre really fast asleep ill wake you up and ask you what  youre thinking about  marisha okay yeah deal  sam great  taliesin well i suppose if the stormlord put you on this path then youre with us now because of  some divine intervention i think its important to follow ones feelings on such things i commend you  ashley well thank you  taliesin yeah  ashley what was your name again  taliesin caduceus caduceus clay its a pleasure  ashley caduceus clay thats a very interesting name  taliesin thank /none/ you theyve been your friends have spoken very highly of you in your absence  ashley thats very nice  travis we have missed you we dont mean to pry  ashley no ive missed you guys too but sometimes its just best to go my own way sometimes  marisha i mean by all reality we barely know each other  ashley its true  liam it is funny how you keep showing up though like a bad penny  ashley isnt it weird  taliesin i never understood that penny  laura i have a weasel here  /none/ taliesin oh no okay thats oh wow  laura his name is sprinkle  taliesin sorry sprinkle  ashley where did you get whoa  travis interact with that fucking weasel  matt you see this bright crimson weasel that is now curled up in your hand and chattering  laura hes not trained yet dont lose him  sam yet  matt it pisses right in your hand  ashley thats uh thats okay this is sprinkle  laura mmm  ashley thats a very cute little thing i dont want to crush it  laura theres a dog /tavern/ too  ashley theres a dog  liam as soon as the animals come out i go to talk to the barkeep  matt as you say dog you look down and you can see the right side of your boot is now being  slightly moistened by the urine of the tiny puppy all the animals are apparently marking you as  their territory but you see this tiny light brown puppy with big oversized paws and a couple  of faint stripes across the fur these pointy feyfeatured elements more angular than a softer  puppy should and /none/ these eyes look up at you panting  ashley aww i do like dogs very much this is very cute whos this  marisha oh sorry  ashley whats his name  sam laura and marisha nugget  ashley nugget  marisha what if we teach nugget to also be able to bamf to yasha while shes gone  laura i know its been a long time but her name is yasha  marisha it has been a long time yasha then maybe nugget can go back and forth between us when  were away  sam to yasha  /tavern/ laura can he blink that far i mean when i blink i blink only ten feet believe me i wanted  to go farther and i just kept blinking  liam from the bar it seems very doubtful excuse me  marisha but how cool would that be  matt the somewhat portly halfelf greets you as you approach again all right would you like  another drink  liam you know im still working on the first one but i love your establishment  matt oh why wait its good to have a backup right  liam ja i /town/ will take a backup you are correct  matt all right very well  liam while youre pouring i had a question for you my friends and i we have just rolled into  town and while we were walking through we noticed this very strange tower here its so  bizarre what is that place  matt im sorry what the big blue tower over in the quay  liam that grows and shrinks when you walk toward and away from it  travis tide peak  liam dont know the name just being casual you know  marisha /none/ i yell over oh now youre interested in the tower  liam i ignore her like usual  matt yeah i know of it yeah why why do you ask  liam well its just that it changed oh thank you its just that it changed proportions the  closer we got or further away from it it didnt seem natural  matt yeah its got some weird sort of illusion magic to it its creepy  liam whose is it  matt belongs to some mage hes been here for a while named yussa  liam thats it hes /none/ a mystery to the city i suppose  matt a mystery to me i dont fucking go and start climbing up towers to ask questions where  they dont belong  liam you have to be a jackass to climb a tower like that its just ripe full of danger  marisha stay on task widogast just quoting your own advice  matt thats um  liam shes you know a crass idiot dont mind her but  marisha shouting can i get another wine  matt same or  sam shes right next to you  liam this close /tavern/ good job asshole  matt he goes and prepares looking at this would you prefer a pitcher  marisha yeah  laura beau we need to get going we need to find algar  travis its midday this guys like fucking money tourists  liam well thank you for your time he pours his glass out on the ground out of the bartenders view  marisha the fuck whats wrong with you  liam subtle thank you very much for your time  marisha shouting that was my shoe asshole  liam youre yelling at me from across the bar /none/  marisha you just established that i was next to you  liam not in a german accent marisha  sam everyone please yasha has to catch an express bus out of here so we should probably get  to asskicking  laura i cant believe you didnt get my messages  ashley where did you send them to  laura to your brain  sam yeah the magical messages they should have arrived that doesnt make any sense unless if  you were under someones spell  liam or sleeping perhaps  laura well i guess i could have /none/ sent them while you were sleeping i guess  ashley did i get any messages  matt thinking back you had received these words but not having a lot of experience with this type of  spell contact before you werent sure if it was you imagining things or having a slight nervous breakdown  ashley i did have times when i was walking where i heard your voice but i didnt really hear  words it was more like indiscernible babbling i didnt get any  laura i need to be more specific with my messages you know and /none/ i never got to say you  can reply to this thats an important part of it  sam well thats four extra words  liam also speaking from experience sometimes when youre very focused on a task it can create  a blind spot  laura sad trombone noise  taliesin is there something we can throw hold on  liam thats the worst shit thats ever been said on this show  sam stay on task widogast  laughter  laura how do we find al gore algar shit  marisha how do we find algar  sam /tavern/ we have asked everyone in this bar about everyone else in this town except for al gore i  dont think that we have no we have not  marisha we asked about the sluice  sam the tower weve asked about sabian weve asked about marquet weve asked about the marius  guy we need to ask why we came here  marisha we asked orly about the sluice and he said he didnt know  travis nott why dont you get up on a table and get everyones attention and ask the room if  they know anything /none/ about algar  laura or the sluice  marisha i mean they already know were all here  sam all right i take a big swig of booze stand up on the table take off my mask  travis everybody your attention please claps  matt everyone curls over  sam shouting everyone in the wayfarers cove  taliesin is this a good place for thaumaturgy fuck it lets accent this  sam youre surrounded by a band of goblins theyre everywhere and theyll come in here  unless you tell me the location of algar tell me now and /none/ i kick over a chair  matt the chair falls over  sam two kicks  matt it finds its way to the ground theres a pause as everyone looks around  sam theres goblins everywhere theyre banging at the windows  laura i use thaumaturgy to bang the windows  liam this is totally the diner scene in pulp fiction now  marisha maybe add his last name dyomin  travis every fucking last one of you  sam you might know him as mr dyomin  matt theres a continued pause as they all look around  taliesin /none/ free round for anybody who has any information  matt doing a pass across everybody in this room with a discerning eye especially with your  passive insight you get the sense that nobody here really knows this algar figure  travis weve threatened them with goblin tactics  sam that was of course a scene from the oneact play that you can see later tonight  laura over at the fancy i forget the place that im from the fancy place  sam the marquis demesne  matt the lavish chateau  laura the lavish chateau  travis i /none/ love that monologue  ashley are you guys doing a play  matt orly is clapping with his giant mittlike clawed tortle hands not too bad  laughter  laura lets get out of here and find the guy also we have to remember tonight  travis midnight  laura head to the docks  sam to talk to  laura marius  travis lepual  sam first question to marius how do you pronounce your last name  laura yeah thats going to be a really important one  marisha well do we want to go by the sluice /none/ weave or is that going to be way too shifty  laura we cant just go to the sluice weave its underwater  marisha yeah but there are gates  laura and they said we could get in trouble if we go there uninvited  marisha so how do we get invited  laura this is true  travis i mean it couldnt hurt to do a driveby and just see if we could see anything  marisha see what kind of paperwork or identification  laura i thought the gates were underwater  travis i thought they were too /none/ i thought the entrance was underwater  matt thats what you were told from the light keeper at the lighthouse she said as far as she  knew the entrances that she knows of are beneath the docks where the land falls off and meets the  ocean and the docks are out there its somewhere underwater there  laura lets go and see if we can see something  marisha but i mean do we swim  sam how  marisha and laura yeah  travis well yeah everybody can swim  sam why dont we take a rowboat /none/ and ill just stay above the surface and when you guys are  ready tug and ill pull you up  travis are you strong enough to pull us up  sam yasha will stay with me  laura yasha can swim though  marisha yasha and i want to kick douchebag ass together its been so long  ashley yeah  laura ill hold your hand underwater nott  ashley do you want to ride on my back i am a very good swimmer  liam thats true you could piggyback  laura like a dolphin  sam i /none/ dont understand were just going to go out into the harbor and start swimming blindly  looking for an underwater gate  travis got to start somewhere  sam why dont we send someone first or at least ask around before we just start swimming  liam maybe ask a few more questions in a few other places besides dive bars  marisha i mean you cant live at the sluice right hes got to leave it at some point right  travis yeah but i mean at least if were heading towards the docks where the entrances are  /tavern/ im sure more people in that area will know  sam lets go  laura lets go to the docks  matt all right youre not that far away thankfully youve been hanging around the  restless wharf for a while which is where the tavern was striking out towards the edge and  looking across the docks theres one large ship that came in and looks like a lot of stuff is  being unloaded and is busy on that end not that far off of it the next dock that shoots out and  turns to the right /none/ there looks like theres a couple of anchored ships there its a little less busy  looks like theyre currently moored there and not a lot of folks are doing business on or around  the ships other than just keeping a watch on the docks themselves  travis should i secure us a rowboat  taliesin is that something you can do  travis pretty sure i can  taliesin then yeah  travis is there a ship shack or something that would lease vessels  matt make a perception check  travis its an official term guys 13 /dung/  matt you dont see anything in the way of a ship shack right now you do see a man an older  grizzled fisherman of some kind or at least a dock worker he has this long cap on that dangles past  his midshoulders in a heavy dark gray cloth shirt that is drenched with sweat like hes been  doing hard work throughout most of the day you see him currently tying a small rowboat to the edge there  and holding it in place  travis old timer im sorry to bother you i dont see /none/ a mariners office around here is that  your rowboat  matt oh yeah this here is my boat whats your name sir  travis fjord  matt fjord jimmy  travis jimmy  matt pleasure to meet you  travis absolutely  matt you much of a shipman yourself  travis little bit little bit my friends here were hoping to explore the coast a bit and if i  could put some coin in your pocket i was wondering if you would mind parting with your  vessel here for a little bit  matt well say because /none/ you have a sailors background at this point you guys converse back  and forth a bit you swap some stories with him about how he used to be a dockworker and some  of the ships he was on back in the day  travis tales of the worst greenhorns youve ever worked with  matt yeah about five minutes of back and forth you get to the point where youre both laughing  and feel comfy eventually he goes dont even worry about the money just ill keep an eye on  out here and dont take it /none/ too far out in the bay when youre done bring it back  travis that is most kind of you we are much obliged  matt least i could do he goes ahead and helps untie the boat you have it at your disposal  laura is it big enough for all of us  travis is it big enough for all of us  matt you can certainly try comfortably it can fit four people uncomfortably it could fit you  all spacewise youre uncertain as to the ships ability to hold the load  marisha nott why dont /none/ we just pull you along since you have your waterwalking ring it would  be like skiing  travis actually thats not a terrible idea i was going to volunteer to be pulled by  sam i weigh less than yashas sword so if you want to save some weight  laura thats true yasha could put the ring on  sam oh but i would have to take it off  marisha then youd ride in the boat  laura yeah and youd be safe in the boat surrounded by water in the ocean  liam have we been /none/ led to the boat  matt yeah  travis its tied up to the dock  liam yeah im leaving them and im going to sit in the boat im pulling out my book and im  slapping it down and i start to mutter to myself this is going to take a while  travis caleb seems very comfortable since it only fits a few folks i  sam ill stay on the shore its fine  travis no you have to come with i was going to volunteer to trail behind the armor helps  laura maybe i /none/ should too because you know im watery now  travis oh thats right  laura yeah  sam you are  laura i am blue and thats the same color as the sea  taliesin im going to get a little smaller so that i take up less space in the boat  travis what you get smaller what do you mean  taliesin im going to turn into a shaggylooking halfelf literally probably look a bit like  shaggy from scoobydoo  travis is that a disguise self thing  matt yeah  travis does it change your physical /none/ weight and stuff  sam i dont think it changes your weight  matt it doesnt change his weight but  taliesin it changes the amount of volume but i actually do change volumetrically in size though  i can get several feet shorter its a firbolg thing  travis oh it is a firbolg thing well fuck thats awesome  taliesin i can seem up to three feet shorter but  sam yeah seem  matt yeah volumetrically it wouldnt make that much of a difference for you  taliesin well i did it anyway  travis i think /none/ youll be fine actually if jester and i are trailing behind  sam how is jester going to trail behind because her dad has sweaty palms  travis some people arent scared of the water nott its actually quite safe  sam they are wrong its horrifying theres monsters in it you cant see down below it can  snuff you out in a few moments  taliesin youve just described every environment that life can manifest in  travis look nott and i reach down into the water and touch it with my hand there is  absolutely noth /none/ yells i just fall right into the water  sam oh no  matt fjord just disappears beneath the surface  travis just churning bubbles and stuff  sam its not worth it lets go  travis i pop back up see totally fine  sam what was it that got you  travis youll never know  laura hey yasha  ashley yes  laura this is the sea  ashley yes ive  laura its pretty huh  ashley it is very pretty

ashley yeah  travis oh  ashley been here for three days  laura what  sam thats longer than us how did you know we were coming  ashley i didnt know you were coming  taliesin are we calling dibs on the boat  ashley maybe this is the closest ocean that i knew maybe your message did get across jester  and i did hear it somewhere in the corner of my /none/ brain  laura i like that  ashley yeah  laura i get in the water  travis well somebodys got to ask if anybody has any idea where the entrance to the  taliesin i think i saw it if i recall  travis the entrance  taliesin she pointed it out didnt she when we were  matt she pointed a basic direction but there was no visual guide to it  taliesin ill feel confident in my knowledge thats fine  laura go ask your sailor friend fjord  travis im in the water with you  /none/ laura yeah get back out and go ask him where the sluice is  matt you come out dripping the water slowly pouring out from under your armor  laura woo yeah  travis im covered in armor  laura its still wet  travis okay price of a good joke im afraid are you knowledgeable about the entrance to the sluice  cove sluice weave  matt ive heard of that but i dont really know much about that sorry  travis well  matt good luck though  travis thanks  laura was he telling the truth  /none/ travis yeah he was telling the truth  laura how do you know  travis because i know sailors  sam are you sure about that a guy who works at the docks in the harbor where this thing is  wouldnt know the location of everything under the water  travis why dont you threaten him with a trove of goblins around the wharf while  sam that would have worked if someone had been a little snappier with the thaumaturgy  laura its my fault im sorry i yell from the water  travis is there anyone else /none/ on the docks anyone else that we can see  matt yeah theres a handful of other people that are in the process of largely on the other  side where that bigger ship is thats being currently unloaded or loaded into you cant tell  from this distance  travis are there any crownsguard or im going to say zoleezzo  matt zolezzo  travis zolezzo thank you  matt there are you can see two zolezzo that are just patrolling the docks  liam with all this dicking about how long would you guestimate ive been muttering in /none/ the boat  matt ten minutes  liam ten minutes okay  travis hey beau

laura oh thats not bad  matt thats not bad at all  marisha its okay  matt all right you look and of the two that are there one of them seems to be pretty preoccupied  with the ships that are being loaded and one of them appears to be halfpresent probably in  middaydream yawning at his post and looks younger than /none/ the other one between the two of  them hes probably the most insecure if you had to decide  marisha valley girl voice oh gosh isnt the water just so beautiful man its  matt im sorry can i help you  marisha its hot out here just so moist this air right  laughter  marisha and i sighs whats your name  matt im sorry i am working at the moment  marisha oh great because i could totally use some help  matt you can see his eyes roll and he goes what can i do /town/ to help you then  marisha well you see im from out of town im tracy by the way whats your name  matt he sighs heavily and reaches out and finally takes the hand he goes hello i am zolezzo merpol  marisha merpol hi its just you know im here and im trying to get the true nicodranas  experience while im in town and you know i just ive heard rumors from people you know  about this thing called the sluice weave and you know i would just love to see it see if its  /none/ real you know  matt make a persuasion check  laura i love imagining beau in the outfit that shes in  taliesin yeah  laura freaking wraps on her arms  travis bruises on her arms  liam a fucking stick up the back  travis old busted lip scars  liam although to be fair ive seen this many times at st patricks day parades in new york  marisha 14  liam slurred excuse me officer  matt 14  travis come on baby  marisha im too dumb to be a risk right too vapid to /none/ be a hazard  matt he goes oh that is a very specific curiosity  marisha im into curiosities im a curious person  matt well the sluice weave is a series of tunnels that were installed probably a century ago  that are responsible for they are ducts that guide water from the ocean to a series of small  engines in the city that help propel the furnaces that the various businesses and locations here  that require that sort of intense power to utilize its also  marisha wow i hear theyre haunted are they haunted  /none/ matt well not haunted per se but there are  marisha oh you gave me a little smirk theyre totally haunted  laughter  matt he goes not haunted but there are elements to it  marisha i give him a little giggle  matt hes like uncomfortable laugh  laughter  matt he goes there also there are things that help maintain the sluice ducts and occasionally  help protect elements of the bay if ever its under attack  marisha i bet youre first in line to protect the city against an attack arent you  matt sheepishly /none/ i mean theres been you know about a year ago they had this one ship that  came into the there were these thieves and i happened to be on job at the moment and so yeah  marisha wow so interesting so have you been down there  matt i havent been down in the sluice area there the entrance as far as i know is mostly  hidden the one inside the city  marisha oh so theres one inside the city  matt somewhere i dont know  marisha oh wow i heard there was one in /none/ the ocean  matt yeah theres two or three i think that are right down off the side here come here  and he leads you over  travis were all just aghast just like  marisha i turn to fjord and i go gagging sound  matt laughs he leads you over across the dock for a bit and he points down in the water and  goes i think somewhere in this vicinity there is sort of the intake tube or pipe where the ocean  water is brought in to the sluice ducts  marisha sounds like /none/ its got a lot of suction in the intake  matt make a perception check  travis oh my god this cake needs more layers girl  marisha perception is that what you said  matt perception yes  marisha okay 15  matt from this distance its too hard to see beneath the water it gets a little too murky but  he points in a general direction and you get a loose idea of where it may be  marisha wow yeah cool  matt hes like so what are you up to while youre in the city /none/  laughter  marisha wow yeah you know im just so busy you know just trying to fill my schedule with  things i should probably go now  matt of course where are you staying  marisha forced giggling im staying at the lavish chateau  matt oh wow that is a very expensive place  marisha i know you probably couldnt afford it so  all ooh  matt you can see the visible pained grunt to his chest hes like well perhaps ill if you  want other things to see around the city when im not /none/ on my post i could maybe come by and give you  a little tour  marisha sure that sounds great  matt of course what are you doing right now i only have about 40 minutes until i get to switch  my shift and then im off for the rest of the afternoon  marisha forced giggling  taliesin this is everything i wanted  liam this is so painful i feel like i should make a concentration check on my spell  marisha you know im actually doing a quick little boat tour just right over there /none/ but ill  be right back okay byeee  laughter  matt he looks a bit flabbergasted  marisha just over there ill be right back just giggle  matt see you later what was it what was the name tracy  marisha tracy what was your name  matt he sits there for a second and goes tracy  marisha oh wait your name is marisol  matt yeah merpol  marisha porpal marpol  matt laughs merpol  marisha merpol merpol  travis dont write that down  marisha heavy breathing that was  laura wait wouldnt it /none/ be funny if that was marius  matt yeah no different name he thinks to himself tracy and continues the rest of his  post along the dockside  marisha i need a shower  travis where did that come from  marisha i dont know i think it was something deep down inside me that i actually really hate  that its there its maybe always been there and then i had to deep breath lets go i dont  want to talk about that anymore  laura she lives inside of you  marisha who the fuck is /none/ tracy  travis lets go  matt so what are you doing  liam im casting find familiar and im changing frumpkins shape  matt into a  liam octopus  matt ooh  travis an octopus  marisha its come true  matt as you guys all begin to gather into the boat the two of you i think you said youre  staying off to the side jester and fjord  laura i guess so  travis were getting into the water and well just either hold on to the back or if we have  rope on /none/ the dock ill just tie four foot  matt yeah theres extra rope available so you guys swim beneath as it continues off through the  water  sam as were untying the boat right its tied up as were untying the boat im going to hide  behind a pillar  matt okay  laura do we see her  matt well find out roll a stealth check  sam thats a two  matt plus  sam plus ten  matt everyone but fjord sees you  laughter  liam nott the brave are you coming with us /none/  sam oh yeah i was just checking the rigging  liam come on i saved a seat up by me and frumpkin  sam great im coming  taliesin youll be all right  liam i have frumpkin slither his way onto notts back and do a cozy hug from behind over the  shoulder not on the head  laura like clarota like brainsucking sound  liam no because thats weird so just over the shoulder and then the tentacles tickle her face  and stuff  marisha and thats not weird  liam thats the joke  /none/ travis there you go  laura dont worry nott if you fall over the side fjord and i will catch you  travis yeah were literally back here as a safety net so dont fret  sam all right  travis beau point us in the direction that your boyfriend alluded to  marisha fuck you man its over there  matt you guys begin to row over in that direction who all is keeping an eye in the  water  travis in the water  matt all right go ahead and make a perception check please  liam /none/ can i assist by throwing frumpkin into the water and looking  matt sure so go ahead and take advantage on that between you and frumpkin  marisha poor frumpkin  taliesin 25  matt okay glancing through the water you watch as one of the sun rays definitely hits a clear  patch of the ocean below you and you see a brief glimmer of what looks to be a either metal or  stone piece that is different from the rest of the natural slightly eroded rock you see a circle  maybe a four or fivefootwide opening /none/ thats about 40 feet down  taliesin frumpkin go take a look at that if you wouldnt mind  liam frumpkin go take a look at that if you wouldnt mind splash sound down towards it  matt all righty  liam and i have my hand on notts shoulder doing that thing  matt okay so there is a circular pipe entrance or a tunnel entrance 40 feet down right as the  water gets darker and more murky bits of clustered seaweed begin to come up and tickle the  bottoms of frumpkins tentacles in that vicinity elements /dung/ of it are blocking the front but you can  clearly see there is a dark tunnel that continues into the earth beneath the city beneath the  docks you dont know how far it goes necessarily  liam do frumpkin and i see anything alive or moving down here  matt make a perception check  liam pretty good 18  matt you do not see anything alive or moving in this vicinity best you can see the tunnel  continues in for about 15 or so feet and there is a metal grate you can see eight or /none/ so bars  across actually about ten bars about an inch thick each and theyre horizontal though its a  little bit tilted to one side  liam how far apart are each of the bars  matt with eight of them and its about four and a half five feet across sorry ten across it  would be about six inches between each  liam i think my octopus could probably squeeze through that  matt yeah your octopus could  liam plopping sound  matt all right  laura are you saying what you see  liam yeah /none/  laura caleb are the bars rusted did they seem rusted at all  liam did they seem rusted  matt oh the bars there isnt a lot of rust as much as there is a lot of barnacles and other  natural sediment that is gathered on edges of it you can still see the metal you can see a little  bit of rust here and there looks like more natural elements seem to have crusted and  clustered around parts of it  liam im going to urge frumpkin on further to see what we can see /dung/ frumpkin has dark vision  matt okay  about lets see here about 60 or so feet into the tunnel it curves upward  marisha 60 feet  sam 40 feet down 60 feet into the tunnel and then up still underwater  matt yeah  liam up he goes  matt all right about 30 or so feet up the water breaks theres a surface though there is no  light does frumpkins octopus form have darkvision  liam darkvision yes  matt yes okay so does frumpkin  liam yeah crests up and pokes his eye nubs out /none/ of the water  matt okay frumpkin floats there on top for a second and you can see now where it emerges  liam looking for anything moving here while were up here  matt there is another set of bars right at the top of that tunnel that frumpkin has pushed and  squeezed through to come through so theres bars like a grate on the way in and then a grate once  you curve upward into the tunnel  liam so hes come through a second set  matt come through a second set and then breaks /none/ the surface of the water about a foot beyond that  and now you can see it is closed off mostly except for a tunnel that continues deeper in the  same direction that the lower tunnel went and that one continues on for a bit  liam muttering all this as it happens  laura is there any air between the water and the grate  matt there is no air between the water and the grate  liam this is all water  matt yeah its all water up and then theres the grate and then it turns /none/ into this tunnel that  continues inward and theres about a foot of water beyond that and then theres air from that point  liam im going to speed him back to the first grate and have him took for the locking mechanism  if there is one  matt make an investigation check for frumpkin  marisha oh you have knock thats right fuck yes  liam thats investigation  sam doesnt work underwater  liam or through an octopus thats a 14  marisha thats true if you cant speak actually  matt 14 you can still mutter /none/ the incantation underwater  marisha gurgling  liam i think you said last campaign that you can hold the air for one spell possibly  matt yeah in the process of casting a spell if youre holding your breath thats your breath  travis garbled go fuck yourself  matt thats the way to do it looking there is no locking mechanism the grate isnt one that  opens and closes its not a door its just in place  liam okay so he will swirl away and go back to the second and do the same look around  /none/ matt another investigation check  liam ja  travis while hes doing that can i pop my head underwater and look around just make sure theres  no anything coming around  matt perception check  matt the second grate also appears to not have a locking or unlocking mechanism they arent meant  to be removed it seems in a casual way they seem to be placed there intentionally for an  indefinite period of time  liam okay all right buddy  travis 17  matt 17 you see a number of fish swirling through the various bits /none/ of kelp and seaweed that  are pushing up from the bottom of the bay below its beautiful you can see the colors and  glistening bits of silver as the fish curl through the sunlight but nothing catches your attention  as dangerous in your immediate vicinity thankfully  ashley could i look to see if anyones watching us out on the shore  matt make a perception check  sam and travis go yasha go yasha go  ashley i dont think i actually see anything i think i forgot my glasses  matt what did you roll /none/  ashley i rolled a seven  matt okay you look out and people seem to be working on the dock and you know  ashley were safe  liam im sending him forward and i do  matt okay so youre sending him further in  liam past you said it goes now straight that way  matt the tunnel goes on for about another 60 or so feet beyond that grate before the tunnel opens  up into a squarelike chamber with a singular pillar that marks the center of it its still one  foot of water /none/ all throughout this entire area once you go past this you can look past where  this pillar is the chamber seems to close off and another tunnel continues on almost like this is  just a waypoint chamber on the right side you see a much smaller grate maybe a foot and a half  two feet across with a more dense crosslattice of bars  liam not able for frumpkin to squeeze through that im guessing  matt frumpkins size how big of an octopus is frumpkin an octopus id say it would be about  that big /none/  liam im imagining i am not summoning a gigantic octopus  matt but octopuses can squeeze through some pretty small spaces yeah so id say make an  athletics check for tiny octopus frumpkin  liam and that would be strengthbased yeah because it doesnt say on his thing that is a nine  matt frumpkin gets partially through but the nature of the lattice and frumpkins  unfamiliarity with the octopus form reaches a point where it cant quite get all the way through  liam thats true its only his second time okay buddy forget that back /none/ it up is there anything  unique about the pillar down here or is it just basic stonework  matt looks like basic stonework it has a slight curvature to it but its probably placed in here  either as a load bearing piece since this is beneath a heavier city or it doesnt look  remarkable or have any other purpose beyond just being a support pillar  liam are frumpkin and i able to tell if this goes water all the way to the ceiling of this chamber  or is it water with air above or its /none/ all water  matt the water only goes up to a foot and then its air for the rest of it its about ten or so  feet tall the chamber  liam okay is there anything out of the ordinary if he pokes his head up out of the water  matt make a perception check  liam 17  laura getting bored sitting in the water out here  sam no its every lovely we should just stay here all day  matt no guys no better adventure then having all your friends sit back and send your /none/ tiny friend  liam you could always punch the wizard in the head at any time  matt yeah exactly no i know  laura hey yasha lets go try to break through that grate  matt so 17 looking around the water and its salt water its all ocean water coming in here  occasionally you see slight waves little ripples from different directions  liam okay so back on the boat i just say i have gone very far with him and it just keeps going  what do you guys want to do  laura get him /none/ back here and lets try to get through that grate  ashley are there any like buttons or key holes in any of the grates  laura he looked through frumpkins eyes and there was nothing  liam i cant hear any of you so tap me if you want me to keep going one time tap me or two  times if you want me to pull frumpkin out  laura i flick him in the back of the head three times  liam i said one or two i dont know what that means  sam ill gently /town/ tap you twice  liam what are we doing  taliesin based on that description i want to see if i can figure out what buildings would be  directly underneath do my own mental map of what has been described  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin oh dear  travis 40 down 40 across 30 up  taliesin make an intelligence check  matt yeah  taliesin all right that will be fun  taliesin 14  matt its probably a little over 100 feet beyond where you are now though you are probably in the  /none/ boat about 15 or 20 feet back so its about 125 130 feet which you couldnt because its 100  foot range for to  liam pull him back  matt to pull him back yeah  liam then i would tell him then to swim back if we in our game are allowing connection as long  as its not broken i would just tell him to come back  matt okay cool so you are fine best you can tell over there it looks like some sort of  warehouse its a larger storage building its not remarkable /none/ in its design or decor  taliesin maybe that thing is maybe directly on top of what you were looking at  sam i think thats a great idea  travis i think thats a good place to start however if you wanted to test your strength i  would be very careful remember it was an intake so you could get down there and all of a sudden  the suction and the water would make it very difficult for you to back out  laura well frumpkin wasnt getting sucked in was he  travis im just saying /none/ it could be unpredictable it could turn on turn off  ashley im okay with unpredictable  liam i mean i could also if we want to hang a little longer i can just send him you know i  dont want him to be squished but i can send him as far as he can go to see what he hits its up  to you  laura no i want to go try to break through the grate  travis okay who is going down  sam the strongs  marisha ill hold a rope  ashley can /none/ you keep him down there just to watch us  liam yeah of course frumpkin is now like a backpack on yashas back  matt the tentacles wrap over the shoulders and underneath  laura hold on to spr oh i cant do it  sam what  laura im afraid you are going to eat my weasel  sam no i had a lot of seagulls yesterday for dinner im very full still  laura you promise me you wont eat him  liam that really sounds like a euphemism  travis yeah it does  sam i will /none/ not eat your weasel  travis what about the damn puppy  matt the puppy is in the boat like panting barks  laura dont eat the puppy either promise  sam too bony  laura promise  sam too bony promise  laura no nott  laughter  laura you promised me  sam i promise i will not eat your weasel today  laura okay  travis beaus holding onto a lead line  laura lets go  travis big breath deep inhale  matt the three of you dive down which one of you has the lead /none/ line  marisha me  matt who has the other end of it  travis ill take it  matt fjord has it you guys all dive down taking a breath pushing through the seaweed until  eventually you come to the base of where that tube is a few feet into it you see the grate and  its about roughly four and a half fivefoot diameter so you have to crouch down but you can  get a hold on this  laura oh yeah lets get a hand on it and brace our feet against the tunnel /none/ and on the count of  matt all right one of you roll with advantage or you both roll independently  laura it was a practice count whatd he say  ashley do you want to roll he said roll with advantage or roll independently  laura lets roll independently  ashley this is a strength check  liam while theyre rolling i grab notts shoulder and turn on the jacques cousteau camera  on yashas back  sam ooh  ashley 20  matt 20  ashley not a natural 20  matt right but 20 total  ashley /none/ yeah  matt thats the dc you needed  travis oh shit really  matt yeah so you both are holding on and pulling you get your foot in some of the  imperfect stonework where elements of the masonry pokes out which gives you a foot groove and one  part where some of the stone had been rotted away and thats just enough of a point to lock yourself  in as you pull you feel shifting and eventually it comes out of its mooring on the wall  and then slides off to the side you rotate /none/ it a bit and it comes to rest in the middle of it  marisha that is the coolest  travis fuck  laura pointedly humming  marisha oh  matt so you guys go ahead and come back onto it again  taliesin im keeping an eye out  travis did not think that was going to work  ashley i didnt either but its open  marisha what  ashley at least one of them  sam amazing  laura shes really strong  marisha okay heres my other question though can we hold our breath that long /none/  laura did it seem like it was hard to hold our breath while we were doing all of that  matt well you guys all have pretty high constitutions so not really  ashley should we try the other one  laura yeah lets try the other one  matt it works out just so you guys know your constitution modifier is how many minutes you can  hold your breath underwater  travis damn  laura really  travis david blaine up in this bitch  marisha yeah im all right too thats cool  travis make a /none/ summer home underwater  liam my constitution must be low mines three  travis my swim speed is my regular speed  sam our swim speed is half  matt actually technically its one plus your constitution modifier so its even more  laura ooh nice okay we try to go to the second one and break through okay so this time ill be  more specific ill go hm hm hm and then we pull it yeah one two three pull  ashley were pulling down right after three  laura yeah one two three pull  marisha so /none/ you guys are going to go down and come back up again and then well all go  travis im staying at the mouth with the other end of the rope you guys are going in  marisha hopefully the rope can go this far how long is this rope  matt the rope you found here its probably 60 to 70 feet at most  travis thats why im at the mouth of the  marisha tie it up to the mouth of the grate  travis they can just come up it yeah  marisha okay  matt /none/ all right you do that you guys all jump back in a second time  laura yeah  matt you dive back down below pushing through the darker depths of the bay eventually finding  yourselves back to the tunnel where the grate has been shifted to the side so now you have at an  angle underneath you can swim over or under it you guys pincer off of it taking two different  directions and meeting on the opposite side you go a few more lengths before the tunnel shifts  upward you both have darkvision if i /none/ recall good because there was no light source in the  water beyond just the distant glow and shifting of the sunlight through the water you make your  way back up and you find the grate above you this area the footholds arent as easy because  its not quite as close to the elements so the dcs a little higher but if you guys grab hold  you can go ahead and make a check  marisha high come on you guys oh my goodness  laura natural 20  cheering  marisha fuck yes jester  ashley /none/ i got a ten  matt that with your modifier is a 23  laura 23  matt 23 okay you both hold on this time youre having a hard time getting any sort of a foothold  into the space jester you angrily look down and taking your elbow you jam a section of the stone  until it breaks off and you find a section of  laura hot i say about myself  matt noticing this yasha you do the same and smash you guys actually break a few footholds  into the side of this tunnel /none/ once youre set into place you look at each other count to the right  moment and pull i mean youve seen jester do some cool stuff but in that moment its a rosie riveter  travis yeah  matt muscle moment as guns going the metal bars bend slightly metal creak from underneath  the water you hear the echo and then it comes loose from the mooring and begins sinking down  towards both of you the heavy metal is now sandwiching you guys towards the bottom and you  push off and manage to get it to /none/ rotate and you swim around it without having an issue  laura up and up  matt yep  laura up and breathe  matt you guys make it to the surface splash sharp inhale and youre now inside the tunnel  its strangely  ashley jester you are very strong  laura so are you  ashley man were like a strong couple of women  laughter  ashley okay lets see what is out here  marisha oh man were like a strong couple of women  travis since i saw them go up im going to swim /none/ forward to where i saw them disappear and seeing  the grate gone im going to come back out and make my way up towards the boat to let them know  they made it through  matt okay you guys watch as fjord breaks the surface without the other two  sam are they alive  travis yeah they made it through the second grate  sam oh  liam yeah just like i told you they made it through the second grate  sam oh because you can see  liam i can see  travis oh why /none/ am i even coming back inhale splash  marisha i dive in and follow  matt all right  taliesin are we just leaving a boat here is that the  laura oh well thatll totally  sam no dont worry ill take it back to the shore for us in stealth  travis the bottom rope is tied to the bottom so if you tie the rope to the boat you got yourself  an anchor or a moor  marisha you guys want to try and meet us where that pillar is  sam sure ill go to /none/ the warehouse and try to break in  marisha oh no  taliesin no  marisha sounds terrible  liam i think its a better idea for us to stay together nott you know this is a recurring thing  and i think we should what is going on what is this  sam i dont like water  liam yeah but what if we need to go through water  sam mostly we dont we dont live near the ocean  liam mostly but right now we need to  sam its not i dont sigh  liam let /none/ me make a suggestion and i cast suggestion  sam oh shit  travis yeah yes break through that shit  taliesin better than what i was going to do  travis woo  liam i think you should just try it one time and see how it goes and if it goes well then we know  that you are good for the future  travis creepy voice try it you might like it  matt i would like you to make a wisdom saving throw nott please  sam three  travis yeah  laughter and cheers  /none/ matt your fear subside momentarily and you find yourself instinctually nodding as you know what  maybe trying it once and seeing how it goes is exactly what caleb would want  sam yes well you do know best caleb all right this sounds like a good idea  liam yeah we are  marisha you want to dolphin ride my back  sam sure are you a good swimmer  marisha yeah im all right  sam all right  marisha i mean i might not be fjord levels but yeah i can swim  liam and all she /none/ does is eat fish and do pushups i think shell be good underwater  sam im going to take a big swig of whiskey and climb on beaus back sigh all right dolphin  lady ride me  laughter  sam sorry  marisha its the other way  liam its the booze talking  marisha yeah all right i wait deuces you coming in  taliesin oh yeah  sam all right mermaid scale me down  marisha yep that whiskeys working ready were going to do this together  marisha and sam breathing heavily  marisha one two /none/ three and we go  sam squealing  matt splash going under water you hear the  sam still squealing  matt the diminishing squeak as it slowly vanishes beneath the surface caduceus and caleb sitting up  in the ship with a weasel and a puppy  laura oh no the animals  sam im holding the weasel  laura oh god no its going to die  travis we got to get rid of them at some point  laura no i dont want it to die  travis let it happen let it happen  laughter  /none/ matt so as beau swims now beau go ahead and make an athletics check for me because you are  technically carrying two passengers  marisha that weasel is about to die  ashley oh my god  marisha an athletics check  laura and the dog is just on the boat  marisha is that cocked  sam thats a little cocked  matt its a little cocked  marisha i can do the balance thing  liam its technically its slightly cocked  matt yeah that counts  marisha counts  liam it is cocked  marisha its /none/ a good roll though  travis its cocked as fuck  matt no if you can rest a d4 on it  marisha its the test  travis yeah thats okay  matt yeah  marisha its an okay roll 21  matt strongly pushing through using the grate to go ahead and pull yourself forward beneath the  surface you bring your goggles down so you can actually see where youre going once the light  begins to subside you still hear in the water above you squeal  marisha i totally forgot about the weasel by the way /none/  matt oh you dont even know you know nothing about it youre just like i got this swing  upward break the surface inhale come up from the top and there you can see yasha and jester  waiting for you they are stepped up into the tube  laura ay  ashley nott  laura you made it  sam nervous laughter  marisha out of breath you did good  sam wow that was invigorating  matt you hear coughing up water you look down as this waterlogged weasel is now like coughing  and sneezing  /none/ laura ah sprinkle  matt its awake and conscious youre just pushing on its chest  laura wheres nugget  sam i dont know you didnt have me look after nugget  liam so this is a bit of a problem because nobody thought of the dog and thats why i knew it was a  bad decision to purchase it in the first place because now we are stuck with a dog so what do we  do caduceus what do you think  marisha can we get the dog to blink to us  travis no dont do /none/ that the dog will die  taliesin see nugget heres the situation everybody else is going into this thing in the  tunnel i dont know if you want to go into the water if you want to just hang out here and hope  that everything goes okay or if youve got a preference but ill tell you what you can hop  on with me if want to go with us on this adventure if youd rather just sit here ill  leave you a little food and well probably be back in a couple of hours  /none/ liam youre speaking in sylvan correct  taliesin yeah of course  liam ja im listening in sylvan  taliesin so you just want to hang i guess  matt its just sitting in the boat looks over the edge whining  taliesin you want to come with me  matt make a persuasion check actually this would be animal handling  taliesin animal handling  matt yeah  taliesin 20 im sorry not 20 18  matt in your robes theres a comfortable little cradle that you form there and then puppy  whining poof and then appears into /none/ the small pocket in your arm  taliesin hold your breath on the count of three  liam in sylvan caleb says if it goes wrong pup you know bamf out and in and maybe thatll  buy you a little more time  taliesin oh youll be fine well just give you a little i can just give you a little tap if  anything goes wrong  liam i dont care lets go splash  taliesin im going to slow my breathing im going to take one last look around to see if  anyone notices any of /none/ the commotion that were causing  matt perception check  taliesin perception check  laura i really should have left the puppy with my mom  taliesin yeah my perception check was bad for me which is an 11  matt looking around no one in particular seems to be paying much mind to what your business is  taliesin ive slowed my breathing ive calmed myself and im just going to take a very gentle  dive and move in  laura and we tied the boat yeah  marisha i think so  taliesin yeah we tied the /none/ boat  matt i will ask you to make an athletics check because you are swimming mostly with one arm and  your legs as you are cradling the puppy with the other  taliesin athletics check that one was not so good  laughter  taliesin thats a three  liam oh  matt exertion noises you make your way partway through the tunnel and under the grate you get  past that point look up you push off  laura oh god  matt youre tired your lungs are starting to hurt from just the amount of effort /none/ its taking to  go this distance with one arm and your legs kicking youve waded in the ponds near the graveyard  taliesin never done this before  matt youre not a practiced swimmer  marisha yeah do you have hooves  taliesin i can thankfully hold my breath a long time  matt correct the puppy though  taliesin the puppy is having am i feeling a twitch or is it having a  matt not yet no make another athletics check  matt for the second half of this journey  taliesin oh thats better 18  /none/ matt okay yeah you get down low to the bottom of it and push upward right at that moment you  see this little burst of bubble poof in your arm just as youre about to break the surface you  look down frightened and hes not there and as you look up break the surface inhale come up  and you watch as poof in the air  marisha and laura yay  matt you catch nugget panting just waterlogged dripping  travis you brought the dog  laura yay nugget  taliesin he wanted to come  marisha /none/ holy shit the dog and the weasel survived a hundred foot swim underwater  laura we have really good pets  sam are we all here caleb are you here  matt the weasel looks miserable sprinkle is just like snarling  laura ill put him in my hood and stuff and warm up  matt he curls up in there  travis wheres caleb  liam yeah im here i would have beat caduceus here because he was struggling im so proud of  you you made it all this way  sam i just had a feeling overcome /none/ me that i was ive never done anything like that before  liam do you know what the good news is youre going to have that feeling for the next seven  hours and 50 minutes  sam its not real is it  laughing  liam make an insight check  laughter  sam ill just start drinking  matt youre all clustered up in this small tunnel its maybe eight feet across and its  cylindrical in its shape  taliesin ill look around  matt about a foot and a half of water depending upon where youre /dung/ standing in it and it continues  down dark into the next chamber  laura what if the water comes in while were in here  travis thatd be bad  laura we should probably hurry up then huh  liam also there is a small grate just down here frumpkin was not able to get through it but maybe  one of you two ladies could bust that open  laura we could try  ashley yeah we could give it a go  travis its only about a foot and a half across right  liam its right /none/ over there  taliesin lets head quietly in that direction i think might be  marisha but then what  sam frumpkin  liam octopus  matt do you point out the grate to them  liam yeah i did  matt as you guys have moved through the tunnel into the small chamber break in the tunnel path  there with the pillar caleb points over to the grate and you can see its a pretty dense lattice  of metal  laura can we get our fingers in  matt yeah you can get your fingers in theres /tavern/ enough space there to get your fingers in more  each bar is about two inches apart from each other  travis thunder queens  laura lets try it  ashley lets do it  laura can we try to bust it out  matt sure go ahead and make another strength check the beast team here  laura nine  ashley 12  matt exertion noise you get the sense first off your fingers are sore and your arms are  strained from the two previous exerts that youve given and youve done impressive things but you  get /none/ the sense that this is probably because its smaller its wedged into a little tighter in the  small tunnel the actual tunnel there is maybe about a foot across a foot and a half across  most of you would not even fit through it but youre unable to get it to budge at all  laura can we see through it at all whats in there  matt make a perception check  travis as theyre looking ill just creep towards the pillar and cautiously peek around  taliesin is this a fancy room or is this just /none/ a more of a  matt looking around it resembles a subterranean sewer its mostly just stone and masonry thats  slick from the moisture and the air itself is very humid down here there is a lot of moisture  that gathers across the stone and theres streaks of color and minerals that have gathered on the  walls over time you still have the taste of the brine in your mouth from your time under the  ocean but the air in here is still also very oceanlike and salty  laura does it seem like water is /none/ ever up along the walls or does it seem like the water is  always at the level its at  matt make an investigation check  marisha while she does that can i look and see if theres any writing on the wall  laura 18  matt looking at it there are certain markers and the levels that say that there have at times been  different levels of water in here but it doesnt seem often enough like certain levels of minerals  and sediment that you can see but a lot of them seem older and /none/ havent been reached in a while  laura okay i think were safe  matt youre looking for writing you dont see any writing  marisha no type of directional marks any type of using my background any types of thieves  cant for smuggling  matt make a perception check  marisha fuck you gil you havent been good to me today  matt good to you in the past but not tonight apparently  marisha you said perception  matt yeah  marisha 20 total  matt looking around you dont see any markings in the stonework but /none/ as you go across the pillar in  the center looking for any sort of details you hear this faint almost like the sound of a  crashing wave and the rushing of water and you glance around the edge and in the corner you can  see the water that previously was just moving from your breaking the surface moving through has  started to fwoosh almost like its forming a small occasional whirlpool and then comes to  rest for a moment and then  marisha hey fjord  travis yep  marisha is it about time for /none/ high tide  travis is it  matt no  travis no that would have passed by now because its past midday right  matt yeah  liam while theyre discussing i point at frumpkin on yashas back and snap him out and then  submerge myself by that small grate and look and keep my hand above the water and snap again and  frumpkin is past the gate on the other side of it  matt okay frumpkin the tunnel  liam the small grate that we couldnt get open so hes on the other side  matt /none/ okay frumpkin has appeared on the other side while this is happening you watch as the  small whirlpool begins to gather up and rise above the surface in what is a roughly basketballsized  swirl of water like an inverse whirlpool  marisha i really feel like this is like something and it might attack us and it might kill us i  dont know maybe  matt a second one begins to emerge from the water behind you  sam what is going on  marisha mighty nein  travis is it spheres  matt theyre essentially looking /none/ at reverse whirlpools that are rising up out of the water  coming to a point as the water seems to be almost guiding itself  travis oh jesus wide

seems to react pull back and a  spray of water hits the wall behind it you watch as it quivers and then suddenly you see these two  large pseudopods of water somehow emerge from it and you see for a moment this angry face  snarling in the water towards you as both of them begin to rush in towards you in the center of  the chamber  matt were going to go ahead and take a break there  groaning  matt

i even have a plus to my initiative this time around  taliesin you rolled a seven  ashley i still rolled low i rolled a seven  matt thats all right so first round of battle up first you watch as these two emerging /none/  whirlpools begin to form into these amorphous angry spinning and intenselooking tiny water  spouts with bashing pseudopods that swing out and attempt to make some sort of heavy impact with  anybody whos nearby they seem strangely sentient as opposed to being some sort of  manifested trap however with that first initial attack from beau thats the first surprise round  well be going into combat at the top of it it is beau once again so what are you doing  marisha guys anybody still me pop pop pop  travis nice  marisha two attacks /none/ one with my staff  matt are you running up to attack  marisha yes  matt all right  marisha thats a natural one on that first attack well that sucks  matt all right so you go ahead and swing and  matt with your staff and as you give a big old push you watch as it just dissolves and falls  below and youre just swinging into the air it hits the stonework and gong you feel part of  your elbow lock up for a second and it feels a little numb  marisha second /none/ attack still not great 15  matt 15 hits  marisha oh wait but that hit before right okay seven damage  matt all right this is with your  marisha my second attack  matt with your staff as well  marisha still with my staff  matt okay  marisha two attacks with my right attack attack  matt you notice the first impacts of the shurikens that you had thrown seem to pass through  the water with some impact but not heavily and the second staff hit that strikes seems to not be  as impactful /none/ against the wood or maybe against the water form of this creature  marisha okay im going to use my off hand im going to drop my im not going to drop my staff  im going to put my staff around focus my chi and then do a palm attack  matt go for it  marisha fuck nine  matt nine misses so with your bonus action just swings wide these things are small but nimble  and they keep their form seems to constantly be shifting and changing position its like fighting  a miniature squall in /dung/ the middle of it so youre like ah no impact  marisha cool  matt that ends your turn  marisha yep  matt all righty next up jester youre up  laura okay im going to cast spiritual weapon woo  sam matt is it pitch dark in here  matt it is  laura its pitch dark  matt there is no light source in here  travis release the spiritual weapon  marisha i have my goggles  matt so caleb starts hearing all these noises in his  liam no i have the transmuters stone set /dung/ to dark vision  matt oh thats right because you do have dark vision so yeah right now guys  laura so all of us can see  matt where do you want it to go  liam caduceus you can see  taliesin i believe so  matt actually no firbolgs cant so caduceus is the only one in pitch black  taliesin im currently in hold on yeah  laura right above next to beau  matt all right here  laura yeah  matt you got it  laura and im going to hit it or im /none/ going to try  matt technically youd have to move to have line of sight on where it was dropped so youd have to shift  laura okay ill shift to my left singing to my left to my yeah  matt there you go so moving up next to yasha you watch as the spiritual weapon flash happens  laura 14  matt 14 hits  cheering  laura 11 points of damage  matt nice while the impacts of beaus strikes with the staff and the shurikens werent doing a  whole lot it seemed damaging but not /none/ anything as hardy as you were hoping the spiritual weapon  comes down and seems to cleave it in half as it separates and reforms itself you hear this  splashing and swishing of water it sounds almost like a lowered angry growl  laura and then im going to toll the dead on him  matt all right go ahead and roll oh thats its roll its a  laura a wisdom save  matt wisdom save that is a natural four so go for it damage  laura yelling 2d12 11 points of damage  matt good round /none/  laura it vibrates through the water  matt you watch as the impact of the cantrip strikes it and the water seems to shake itself  around for a moment shifting as the sound vibrations are forcing it to coast in a strange  design in its space that ends your turn  laura suck a bag of dicks water creature  laughter  laura and thats my turn  matt all right that brings us to fjord  travis yeah ill move up to this northeastern corner up here turning and seeing the  matt as youre pushing /none/ through youre seeing certain things that are sunken in the water in the  corners looks like bits of materials that have either washed in through the water broken crates  and bits of wood things that gather in the edges you push past them with your feet as you make it there  travis okay ill throw two eldritch blasts to this creature behind caduceus  matt the one that appeared behind the rest go for it  travis two attacks first one is 13  matt 13 just hits  travis just hits ill roll the second one /none/ well fuck thats 12  matt 12 misses so roll damage on the first strike  travis gotcha fuck you five points of damage  matt five points of damage the eldritch blast hits it and you watch as it creates this circle  in the center of its elemental form as it impacts and actually strikes the stone behind with  whatever residual energy from the original impact the hole forms up it took damage it didnt seem  to be as resistant as it had to previous blows magic seems to cut through whatever defense it has  /none/ travis that is my turn  matt that ends fjords its now their turn  sam oh no  matt this one who currently is engaged directly with you is going to wisp around into the water  and emerge on the other side of beau and is going to go ahead and attempt to whirlpool strike you i  need you to make a strength saving throw please  marisha thats a natural one  matt as it emerges you feel the water beneath you begin to whip into a torrent and you are  swept off of your /none/ feet and knocked prone and are considered currently restrained as it moves into  your space its now currently swirling around you and youre having a hard time moving its  now forcing water into your mouth you cant breathe in the moment you are whelmed by the elemental  laura oh no  matt so that ends its turn the one over here is going to go ahead because its closest to  caduceus its just going to shift up into your space get in contact with both you and caleb and  its going to attempt to whelm /none/ you as well i need you to go ahead it can only target one  person but i need you to make a strength saving throw for me caduceus  taliesin all right thats a 17  matt 17 thats a success you feel the same water swirling around your legs and you manage to  pull back and wrench your legs free as the torrent comes to a slow crawl once more and the  creatures form emerges you can see the water now forming these two large sledgehammerlike fists  that hang at its somewhat four fourandahalffoot tall /none/ torso thats going to  end both of their turns caduceus youre up  taliesin how well can i see right now  matt not very well  matt pretty much not at all it is pitch black you are considered blind  laura oh no  taliesin okay im considered blind thats fine theres nothing much i can do about that right  now im going to hold a sacred flame until i can actually see what im attempting to attack  like until i can see well enough to  matt as soon as you can see an /none/ enemy you will release your sacred flame  taliesin yes sacred flame in the meantime ill just stay to myself and maybe try and walk around  to yeah just like there  matt okay so you can hear it and the focus of this swirling splashing sound  taliesin i could use a little light  matt all right so caduceus sidesteps caleb youre up  liam yeah okay so i was looking down towards this grate under the water and i heard the room  go to hell behind me and hear the splashing where beauregard is so /none/ i move in that direction  matt all right so you move this way  liam yeah  matt okay its going to go ahead and take a swipe at you with a slam attack that is a 22 to hit  liam i take it yeah  matt you suffer oh wow that is 12 points of bludgeoning damage you get slammed in the lower  back the hip area and almost spin from the blow of it but continue to stumble forward over to the  position you wanted to be  liam so i stumble forward and /none/ im reaching into my pockets and i pull out the iron powder and i  throw it into the air again and i go whoof with my hands and beauregard enlarges within the grasp  of this thing  matt all right still restrained  liam yeah but with advantage on strength checks now  matt correct  liam and i will go as far into that corner hiding between fjord and the corner if im able to  matt all right so that is about as far as you can get right there because fjord is currently in  /none/ the far corner and im marking you with concentration just so i can keep tabs on that all  right so that ends calebs go nott youre up  sam i see the damage done to my lovely friends and seeing as i care about caleb slightly more i  will attack the one that hit no offense i will attack the one that hit caleb with a shot of a  tinkertop blaster whatever its called  matt go for it  sam all right so thats 20something to hit  matt that hits  sam hes engaged with /none/ firbolg over here right  matt mhmm  sam thats four four four so plus yikes five is  laura 17  sam thank you laughing that  matt all right 17 points of damage on him nice because it is magical it bypasses the defenses  you watch as the bolt hits and theres a spark as it impacts and for a second it seems to almost  lose its corporeal form then flickers back in the bolt sinks down into the water below beneath the  kneelevel of the liquid that seems to consume the entire chamber  /none/ marisha he took an arrow to the knee sorry  matt which as a note guys those who have been moving around i should mention it ive been  keeping tabs under my own right moving through this is considered difficult terrain because you  are about knee to thighhigh in water and youre having to basically wade through as you go  laura except for nott  matt except for nott whos standing above it  liam what about fjord his swim speed is his movement speed  matt technically the mariners armor would give you a swim speed /none/ so you can move through it at  your regular speed so you dont have to worry about it that is correct  sam i will use my bonus action to well ill use my movement to sort of tuck back into the  hallway there  matt here  sam yeah if i can and then ill bonus action to hide press myself up against a wall or  something  matt youll probably have to move a little farther back to break sight from one of these  enemies but go ahead  sam thats fine all right /tavern/ not great 18  matt okay  sam wait is this stealth 18  matt okay good to know  sam i was looking for the hide ability  matt gotcha yeah thats just an action  sam have i been drunk at this point i dont know am i  matt youre not quite no you wouldve had to have been to go through if you werent affected  by a suggestion spell  sam okay so im okay  matt youre on the verge like youre tipsy  sam okay good  matt but youre not drunk all /none/ right that finishes your go  sam yes  matt yasha youre up  ashley okay so  sam i told you water was terrible  matt youve seen beau suddenly grown to a larger size but still being swarmed by the water of this  elemental form  ashley well for one i would like to rage  matt all righty  ashley is it possible to try to pull her out or am i able to  matt you can try  ashley am i able to attack it without hurting her  travis nein  matt you /none/ can certainly try  ashley i dont want to try it  marisha just go for it gurgling sounds  matt so you move up adjacent to beau and the one creature and what are you going to do are you  going to attempt and pull her out  ashley im going to attempt and pull her out  matt okay so you use your action i need you to go ahead and make a strength check you have  advantage because you are raging  travis as beau i feel alive  marisha i havent felt anything since /none/ she left  ashley oh no eight  matt eight you go and grab and try to pull her but unfortunately the water and sediment in here  has given a slick surface to the floor as you pull your feet keep skidding across the floor  you cant get any sort of purchase and you cant pull her out unfortunately  travis is that a strength check  ashley yeah i shouldve attacked  travis did you make it with advantage youre raging  matt yeah you rolled was that not with advantage roll again  travis i got /none/ you boo  ashley shit thats cocked  sam matt ive been rolling the wrong number of die every time  ashley 17  matt okay hold on youve been rolling the wrong number of dice  sam ive been rolling 3d6 but it shouldve been four  matt oh well  sam so i got an extra one point of damage  matt good to know  laughter  matt keep that in mind for the future so 17 will be enough so as your feet are slipping on  the ground you go ahead and take your sword /none/ and jam it into the stone on the side and use that  with your other hand you get it underneath beaus larger arm and wrench her free from the creatures grasp  marisha deep voice thanks  ashley deep voice welcome  matt so beau you are still in this space a little bit  ashley deep voice wow  travis deep voice hey shorty  marisha deep voice hey  matt youre still in the space of the creature but youve managed to be pulled free from it so  youre still prone but you are not currently /none/ whelmed by it  marisha dope  matt all right that ends yashas go unless you want to move  ashley no im going to stay  matt you pull your sword out of the wall and get ready for the next round of combat this brings us  to the top of the round beau youre up jester youre next  marisha deep voice im back can i do like a cool monklike kick and go pop pop like two  unarmed attacks as i kickkick with my legs  matt yeah yeah make  marisha some capoeira shit /none/  matt yeah you can which as you do its a spray and spin windmill of water in the air around  it go ahead and make your attacks  marisha first two unarmed that first one is an 18 being a 25 second ones an eight being a 15  matt both hit  sam ooh tracy  marisha valley girl voice oh my god tracys back  liam added damage  marisha my dad sent me to a fancy prep school oh thats a suck balls roll two ones on my  sixes so two but i got /none/ a four and a three from that extra d4 so nine nein  matt nine points of damage to it from the spinning kick landing on the ground you are now  just barely midcalf in water but its also about ten feet tall in here so youre having to hunch a  little bit your head actually hits the ceiling a bit youre like groaning  marisha im now going to spend a ki point because i hit twice to do extract aspects  matt okay  marisha i want to learn  matt i dont think you can /none/ spend a ki point to do that its just an ability you get to use  marisha thats right we switched that oh its just an ability i get to use now  matt yes  marisha right so i hit twice i would like to know its constitution saving throw and if it has  any damage not resistances but the opposite of that  matt immunities  marisha vulnerabilities  matt vulnerabilities okay its constitution saving throw is a plus three its not technically  a vulnerability but you do see that if it takes cold damage it /none/ partially freezes which reduces  its speed  marisha okay  sam we know things  marisha i just shout it out and say i think if we freeze the thing itll like freeze because  water and then im going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows  mat okay two more strikes go for it  marisha pop pop with my fists first attack is a 22 sorry 23 no 22 i was right the first time  the second one is not good its a nine  matt okay so the first one does /none/ hit second one misses  marisha that is ooh ten damage  matt ten damage very good so with that as youre standing there you go ahead and swing one  fist down and it strikes right at the center of it and you watch as it separates for a second as  it reforms you go for another strike and this time it manages to duck just out of the way  seeing the precursor of that strike and it dodges entirely that finishes your turn  marisha yeah  matt all right that brings us to jester  /none/ laura bring my spiritual weapon down  matt all right  laura thats 16  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  laura that sucks this plus four is five  sam amazing  laura and then im going to use guiding bolt at the other one  matt go for it  laura and im assuming tell me if im wrong because its a flash of light that streaks towards  the creature that would give enough light for caduceus to send something out  matt ill allow it  taliesin thank you  laura all right /none/ okay so how do i do guiding bolt  matt so you roll an attack roll so a spell attack roll ranged spell attack roll thats  cocked yeah  laura 11 plus seven 18  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage for your guiding bolt  laura that is 4d6  sam yeah  laura 15  matt 15 points of radiant damage to it in the middle of this darkness theres this flash of  light and this streaking beam of radiant energy that strikes and blasts into the elemental  caduceus in that one moment /none/ your eyes suddenly focus in on the glowing form almost in slow  motion as this elemental is slowly bursting from the radiant energy and you see that moment  taliesin sacred flame  matt all right so thats a wisdom saving throw  taliesin dex saving throw 16  matt dex saving throw that is a 14 it fails all right itll take the damage on that one  taliesin counting 12 points of i believe is that radiant damage yeah 12 points of radiant damage  matt theyre both looking a little hurt and a little aggressive theyre /none/ now starting to get a  little frenzied that ends your turn jester  laura yes advantage on attacks against that one  matt actually yes because that wasnt an attack roll fjord youre up  travis can i approach the water fuck thats on mr clay and i will use booming blade against it  matt okay  laura advantage  travis advantage  matt yeah she used guiding bolt  travis amazing  liam she lit it up  travis its cocked natural 20  cheering  matt there you go  travis so at 5th level it /none/ deals 2d8 thunder damage to the target  matt correct so 2d8  travis four  matt four so eight plus whatever the modifier is or its just 2d8 right booming blade is  still an attack  travis yeah thats it thats just 2d8 so eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage impact noise it is currently encircled by the booming energy  travis booming energy yes  laura what the heck is that  liam effeminate voice whats that travis whats that  laura tell us what it means  sam booming dick energy  /none/ laughter  liam bde  matt all righty that ends your turn fjord  travis yes  matt all righty its now their turn so this one here now low on health and a bit frenzied is  going to go ahead and take two strikes at the enlarged beauregard that has been its issue at  this time thats going to be a 21 to hit and a 22 to hit 15 and 16 naturally  marisha yep  sam h2 oh no  laughter  matt oh my god sam  travis nasty  liam what you numb /none/ your own tongue with that one  matt its 18 points of bludgeoning damage to you beauregard for its being so small the short  bursts of impact it seems that in its harrowed state its lashing out with all that it can the  other one is going to go ahead and attempt to make a strike at fjord and a strike at caduceus the  one against fjord is a natural one it goes to swing out towards you and you hold the blade up and you  watch as it actually splits its extruding watery arm across /none/ the blade it divides then splashes into  travis water on water violence  matt yeah falls harmlessly onto the ground and it has to reform a new pseudopod the other arm  swings back towards caduceus  laura science  matt thats going to be a 13 to hit  taliesin that does not hit  matt you pull up your shield and deflect it off to the side no major issue there that finishes  their go actually no this guys going to go ahead and move this ones going to go ahead and  shift over towards /none/ jester is becoming a problem caduceus you do have an attack of opportunity if  you want to take one  taliesin sure is it disadvantage because i cant see  matt correct yes  travis and booming energy so when he moves he takes an additional 2d8  matt correct  sam liam and ashley ooh  travis nine points of booming damage impact noise  marisha nein its like that glass of water in jurassic park  taliesin thats the same roll thats 12  matt no worry there then that does not hit that brings us to /none/ caduceuss turn youre up  taliesin im still blind  matt youre still blind  taliesin at some point im going to have to ive never fixed the fact that im a cantrip down  which i will have to fix at some point because this is  matt you should  taliesin i think i had this at one point and yeah it did not have that im going to just ready  another actually im free now im going to try and back into the corner near that treasure chest  im just going to ready another  /none/ laura theres a treasure chest  matt its a barrel  taliesin barrel its filled with treasure  laughter  matt you played diablo you know how this works ting  taliesin its one gold coin im just going to ready another guiding bolt for the second i can  see anything  matt you got it finishing caduceuss turn caleb youre up  liam okay im going to move into that corner and im going to rifle into my pockets and pull out a  small snakes gut peppered in powdered rhubarb leaf and i stick my hand out /none/ and point at the one  messing with my human friend over there and i take the snakes gut and i pull it back like i am  drawing a bowstring as i mutter and i let go and cast melfs acid arrow  matt all righty  marisha youre you in the opening title sequence right now  liam ja that is correct  marisha youre doing  travis youre doing it  marisha youre doing it its so real  travis how do you spell the first word of that spell  liam melf melf  ashley melf /none/  travis unfortunately  matt hes a very prominent sorcerer or wizard  liam you love it that is a 23 to hit  matt 23 does hit  liam yeah counting nine points of acid damage  matt nine points of acid damage to it as the acid arrow strikes and impacts on its form  theres this splash of acidic liquid that actually should i believe beau also has to make  liam it doesnt say anything at least in the dd beyond lets look in the actual book  sam dd beyond is the greatest  liam /none/ doesnt say anything about splash attack  matt yeah it does take lesser damage from the acid but it didnt have a lot of hit points left  so the impact is lessened however let me doublecheck here for the acid arrow  sam science math acid  liam dont do me wrong dd beyond  taliesin the water elemental is going to sit there and have a long thought about its relationships  marisha laughs  matt no sorry thats older systems yeah no that doesnt matter older systems would do splash  acid damage but not in this /none/ one so yeah you manage to pull out of the way as it falls back and  dissolves amongst the rest of it a little bit of sea foam left behind in its wake  travis hard water  taliesin sea foam thats all you are  marisha oh the one next to me thanks  liam im going to tuck my snake gut back into its pocket  matt all right finishing calebs turn nott youre up  sam i will fire my arrow thing at the creature striking it with 20 something 20 things is it  engaged /none/ in something  matt it is engaged with jester yes  laura its engaged to me  sam oh  travis roll your extra thing  sam i did its still terrible  liam its six though  laura its not terrible  sam 17 again  matt 17 as that one impacts you see it reaching out with both of its fists towards jester as it  strikes her its midsection just turns into bits of foam and sea water as it splashes against her  armor and shield  sam i hate water  laura fjord i am /none/ your dream  travis yeah see no big deal  sam panting heavily big deal  travis waters your friend  sam water is terrible it tried to kill us it actively wants to kill us  travis are there any drains on the floor as we walk around  matt as you glance around keeping an eye out make an investigation check  travis 14  matt feeling through the floor and finding your space in here you do not find any grates or any  other exits beyond the tunnel ahead of you the tunnel you came from /none/ and the small grate on the  side but its high enough where the water doesnt actually meet that level yet but you do see the  trailing signs of runoff and various bits of minerals that have gathered and dripped out over  time to cause some discoloration to the stone  travis caleb didnt you want to explore that smaller tunnel  liam breathing heavily ja  sam are you okay do you need healing because caduceus can heal you  laura hes really good at it  taliesin i really actually have a itd be easier if /none/ i could see where i am or  sam oh sorry  liam i cast dancing lights and the four globules start floating around in the air  taliesin oh thats much better  liam ja okay frumpkin would you like to are you still there and hes still on the other  side im going to have a quick look somebody  sam here you are  liam and i send frumpkin further in  matt okay as frumpkin pulls his way through the tunnel slowly the tentacles unfurling and  dragging him forward through this slick somewhat slimy /none/ algae grooved tube it goes on for about a  good 150 feet before it meets another grate  liam at this point i cant send in i can only watch but i did tell him to go so what would  you well its up to you what frumpkin would interpret that as  matt all right so you cant watch at this distance  liam well i think what weve established  matt oh you can view but you cannot give actions  liam i can view but i cant give commands but i said to go in /none/ so its up to you what  matt so frumpkin comes to this next grate go ahead and make a strength check for frumpkin  liam that is oh for frumpkin so i need to go to a different tag thats a three  matt its a three frumpkin is unable to push past that secondary grate and fighting with it for  a bit returns to you within range to communicate and tells you theres no further to that tunnel  liam okay  laura you never know  liam who knows maybe fjord could swim down there if /none/ we could get this gate open but  travis its a real small tunnel im not looking to shawshank my way down that thing  liam yeah but you are a bean pole  travis i am not i am actually quite stocky thank you very much  liam stocky  travis yeah i am ripped to fuck  liam how many stones do you weigh  travis so many  marisha what size are the stones just curious  liam theyre a pound each what are you talking about im talking about  laura what  travis perhaps we /none/ should continue  taliesin i just tap the stone ten hit points  marisha wait is he ten stones  travis where does this tunnel go  laura where does that next tunnel go  ashley the other one  matt the one that had to be there go ahead and make a perception check  laura splash splash splash  travis yasha you do it  ashley okay i got a five  matt its a lot of water ahead and some walls  ashley its just a lot of water and i think just more stone walls  /none/ travis nothing treacherous  marisha thats very astute  ashley i dont think its bad  taliesin is there an intense discoloration maybe of the mold underneath the grate is it a  different kind of  matt oh on the smaller one you mean  taliesin yeah  matt make a nature check  laura im going to kick through the barrel while hes doing that did i find a gold  matt it breaks fairly easy the wood is very soaked and warped and as your foot breaks through  it its now up to the knee inside /none/ of the barrel doesnt shatter youre now stuck with your leg  partially in a barrel  taliesin youre so good  ashley and you guys already checked the pillar for any  travis we looked around for writing and stuff but  ashley can i give the pillar a looksee  matt make an investigation check you eventually pull your foot out of the barrel and look inside  in it the smell in there is of deep briny ocean and possibly something that long rotted and has  since given this faint scent of earth and decay  /none/ sam caduceus you might want that  travis no god no  ashley 17  matt you feel your way around the exterior of the column glancing around you dont see any  particular signs of there being anything different beyond the construction of the rest of  the chamber nothing hidden no language or discerning characteristics  ashley nothing strange  laura lets keep booking  liam remind me it just keeps going forward oh no frumpkin no  matt correct  liam in the same way theres another large grate at the end of the passage  matt /none/ theres no grate its just another continuation of the tunnel the same size of the  one that you entered this chamber from  liam so a tunnel going forward  matt yeah  travis we keep going  marisha and were heading inward right  travis yep  marisha okay  matt all right so whats the marching order  marisha am i still big how much longer am i big beau  liam youre done  marisha aw  travis ill take the front with my darkvision  ashley ill go behind fjord  matt we have fjord /none/ in front we have yasha behind that  liam i will go in the back but i will send frumpkin 80 or 90 feet in front of all of us and  conga line behind whoever is second to last  matt all right frumpkin goes on ahead  marisha are you still blind without your cantrip  liam with frumpkin looking when im looking through frumpkin im blind yeah  matt caduceus and jester  sam notts in the back  matt notts in the back with caleb all righty  marisha ill be in front of

very back  liam yeah  matt whos next nott or  liam i think beau is offering to not let me fall faceplant  sam im right next to him  matt okay  laura and nuggets going to run up and try to bite and play with frumpkin  matt okay so as youre making your way through the /dung/ water this puppy is trying to dog paddle from  the foot and a half of water whimpering  laura oh shit its a foot and a half nugget come back here blink to me darling blink to me  matt roll an animal handling check  liam also you have to train your animal to harass mine  laura ooh that is a 23  matt youre starting to get this connection between you  laura blink to me nugget  matt blinks into your arm and you grasp it now soaked in water it begins licking up your /none/ chin  and getting excited  sam you got your weasel on your back  laura yeah  matt the two waterlogged pets right now are flanking her throat what could possibly go wrong  liam you doubled down from the last campaign didnt you  matt you didnt have to buy it  travis i know we didnt  sam jester youre starting to smell like caleb  laura gasps  sam wet dog and wet weasel all over your neck  laura ill take a really good bath when we get back  travis we move on  /dung/ sam your knee smells bad  laura oh no  travis yeah you stank  laura no  matt moving forward  liam caleb is laughing quietly in the dark  matt make a perception check for frumpkin  liam ja okay  matt in the octopus form  liam ooh thats good 18  matt moving on ahead for about another 80 to 100 feet down this long tunnel it opens up into  another chamber thats larger than the one you were previously in it seems to curve open  slightly for about ten or so feet and /none/ then opens even wider its a large cubeshaped chamber the  same water level resting at about a foot foot and a half up  liam i would whisper that into beauregards ears not being able to hear her and tell her to hold  the group up for a moment  marisha hold  liam i describe the room i dont know whats in there yet but somethings changing  marisha big square room gets bigger its changing  matt you see three grates that are similar in size to the ones that blocked your entryway  theres one /none/ on the right one on the left and then one on the far end across from you where the  chamber seems to end however there are two platforms that are raised up about ten feet above  with a very small railing and two pathways that vanish further in theres a raised two watch  points that protrude out and look over the smaller part of this chamber  liam three water passages and then two hallways that are dry  marisha like balconies  matt like balconies that protrude from the far wall to overlook the interior of /none/ this chamber  marisha do the balconies go all the way across sorry im not asking caleb or anything  matt they push out about ten feet from the wall before they come to an end so theyre more of a  travis more balcony terraces  matt yeah theyre not beautifully designed per se theyre made of the same stonework but they  look to be positions to supervise the interior of the chamber  liam dm youre describing those platforms but then there are passageways further leading in  matt correct there is a very faint dull tealgreen /none/ glow underneath the water in the far  center of the chamber  liam i mutter that to beauregard  matt there is also a faint mist that drifts over the surface of the chamber in here  liam this room looks kind of fucked up we should not rush into it  marisha do you see any movement i ask caleb  sam the water can fly now  liam its eerie but do i see any living creatures or threats  matt currently no movement no creatures  laura oh no  marisha its everywhere  liam my /none/ cat doesnt see anything but i dont trust that theres are you listening to me  marisha yeah yeah  liam tap me on the shoulder if youre listening to me okay ow god we dont see anything but i  have a bad feeling  marisha he has a bad feeling like something in your lower parts of your intestines  liam frumpkin come back the room ahead is not good  laura like monsters more of those water things  liam no theres something of a magical nature up there  travis how deep did the water look /none/  liam frumpkin would have seen that as would i  matt its similar about a foot and a half or so  marisha what makes you think its magical  liam its glowing  laura maybe we could get up to those little terraces or something and avoid it can anybody  walk on walls  sam i can walk on water  travis i could get up there  marisha im pretty good at actually climbing  liam well yeah but youre assuming that nothings going to happen when you get into the  room or close to /none/ the room  laura what if we dont touch the water what if all of us hang on the side of the walls and move  around the room  liam i am hearing a lot of what ifs  travis can we move to the mouth of the room so still within the tunnel not going into the full  space yet but able to see in and up  matt yeah moving up to the very edge of it you can see the interior of this chamber and the  display that caleb had described caduceus as you /none/ guys are stepping up you hear this faint echoing  sound emerging from the upper left hallway you see a very faint bit of light coming and you hear  talking  marisha this is through frumpkin  matt no this is caduceus  laura i cast pass without a trace do i have that i do yeah i cast pass without a trace on  all of us  liam im casting mage armor  laura were going to stealth right because i just cast it on all of us  matt roll some stealth checks  travis plus /none/ ten  laura yeah and i give caduceus the blessing of the trickster  matt all right everyone make stealth checks please  laura you get advantage  taliesin oh thank you  laura add ten  taliesin 27  travis 26  laura 19  ashley 15  liam 14  sam 38  marisha 24  taliesin youre in another game  matt you all quietly get low into the water and off to the sides of the entrance to best stay out  of range of the light source you guys feel pretty confident that you are /none/ for the most part out of  range of anyone who isnt fairly perceptive you can see the faint dull glow from the center far  end of the chamber now that youre closer and can see there are two similar pillars in the center  of the room the last room you were in they were just loadbearing center bits there are some  small elements of almost walkways or little bits of stone that emerge from the far wall and the  corners that either rubble has built up or its been intentionally built as some sort of /none/ platform  there thats off the water  marisha why would they have a patrol in a sewer system  matt at this point you see the light emerge from that side and you hear the voice say the  complaints are driving me up the wall zsundie is going to get an earful if hes slacking on those  engines  liam sam and marisha zsundie  matt at this point you watch on the left side the upper area holding a lantern algar emerges  all gasping  matt looks over the platform there flanked by a worker /none/ of these tunnels whos wearing a simple  leather frock with gloves and is listening to him and walking up beside his two dwarven bodyguards  are beside the two of them as they approach and look over the side he looks over the edge the  small railing and looks into the water and goes oh hes sleeping holds up his left arm and  begins this zsundie stand to attention you frustrating water spout the glow begins to pulse  and the water bows a bit above im going to whisper something to you  taliesin okay because /none/ i was like ten seconds away from casting eyes of the grave  sam whispers  laura i want to listen but i shouldnt listen  travis guys our nyc live show  sam tickets are still on sale orchestra seats very few left  travis east coast come bring it boston massachusetts  marisha balcony seats though good view  sam who knows what will happen at the live show  matt as the water bows up you see it burst like a bubble and there emerging from that space below  where it was you see something that /none/ looks like an impressively large aquatic humanoid their chest  and torso rather rotund their skin a bluegreen color long thin arms that end in somewhat webbed  clawed fingers their face somewhat fishlike with a wide mouth and small fins that crest the  head the lower half of its body seems obscured by rushing water at first but then as it comes to  its full stance at about seven eight foot tall you notice that the lower half of its body is just  water its a constant swirling whirlwind similar to the creatures you were fighting /none/ in the previous  chamber that dull glow seems to emanate from most of its torso in this darkened chamber and it  gives this faint light source by its very presence  it has a small vest on and sets of jewelry including this thick metal band that hangs like a  presentory necklace around its throat it turns and looks up and says at your service it seems  to say with an undertone of exasperation and eyeroll algar screams out to it again the  archway craftsman are complaining of cold furnaces and slow bellows please ensure /none/ enough water is  being spun through the engines into the district he snaps his fingers really tightly on his left  hand with a low grunt of brimming hatred the creature raises its arms and a large stationary  wave of water rises from the depths beside it the liquid seems to form once more and theres a  slight sparkle of energy around its hands and this second bowing forms into a large curved wave  that seems to be perpetually crashing and then filling itself similar to the creatures you just  fought but a much larger /none/ scale it whips into its full form and where the head would be bends and  shifts almost elements out of the movie the abyss as it turns toward this figure being  referred to as zsundie it spins around and looks up towards the supervisor and his troupe thy will  is my bond the two of them begin to turn and shift towards the left hand grate in the chamber  travis what is the distance from where we are to the terrace balcony space that theyre on  matt id say roughly 80 or so feet at /none/ this point zsundie comes to a stop and looks over his  shoulder in your direction and goes oh intruders algar shouts off what how and  holds up his lantern and focuses the beam over across the way there you guys even though youre  up against the wall theres nothing to hide behind the light pushes past a few of you and  then stops he shouts off dispatch them quickly  marisha who says that zsundie  matt algar shouts it off to zsundie down below lets roll initiative  laura how far away is algar from /none/ us  matt you will see in a second  marisha maybe we can talk to him he seemed like a genie  laura i bet its his necklace  marisha it feels like a genie circumstance right  sam wait who has a necklace algar  laura zsundie has a necklace on and hes like  ashley my will is my bond  marisha i dont want to fight this guy lets try and talk to him  sam you dont want to fight this guy  taliesin well theres an easy way to deal with this  laura /none/ not

matt yeah hes the tall one right there  liam matt im putting frumpkin in this corner  travis were not in the room right  laura no we havent come in yet we were all hiding in this little thing im

constitution thats what you said  marisha the water elemental that i rolled against had a plus three to its constitution  laura so they probably have pretty high  marisha maybe i can find out /none/

correct  laura hes glowing  matt theres a faint glow from there but there is not a technical light source beyond the lantern  here so this area is torchlight and then dim light /none/ in that area so you can see most of the  chamber in dim light the closer you get to algar the better vision you have so we have were  missing what is caleb and  liam oh 13 sorry  matt all right  sam did you go

and go further one  with my 45 feet of movement  matt lets say from there its a lot of movement but its also running off of walls that  dont really to land off of it youre going to have to land this way im thinking /none/  trajectorywise  marisha okay ive gone counting 20 arguably 25 to 30 can i just then try and get here  matt make a secondary acrobatics check because youre now running off of two different walls  marisha copy with still disadvantage  matt with disadvantage yeah because theyre slick  marisha not as good that time gil  travis you keep putting him in the mix  marisha 12  matt yeah thatll put you at there with ten more feet of movement  marisha with ten more feet can i be like excuse me excuse me nott /none/ sorry  matt five ten no because youd finish your space because youre in the water at that point  and its considered  travis five  marisha oh so i can only get can i get behind her  matt no because youd be occupying the same space as nott  marisha well then and i cant see algar  matt you can see algar barely he has threequarters cover  laura tug your shirt  matt there you go  sam tshirts are bullshit  marisha fuck it this is what i worked for im going to go /none/ for it and try and do two shurikens  right at his face threequarters cover first one is a 14 plus seven so thats a big old 21 and  then nine plus seven is a big old 16  matt this is to algar  marisha yep  matt both of them  marisha mmhmm  matt all right with threequarters cover thats going to be a plus five to ac so his ac is  technically what were the two rolls  marisha a 21 and a 16  matt the first one hits  sam yeah algar /none/ dont mess with the ruby  marisha the first one mmhmm nine damage  matt all right actually yeah they dont have a moment to react cool so that ends your turn  marisha yeah  matt you throw both one ricochets off the other one grunt algar looks what the hell get them  marisha i go around the corner  matt that ends beaus turn it is now the water elementals turn vanishes beneath the water  sam we won  liam we won we won  matt emerges right there  sam ah  laura over beau /none/  matt yeah next to beau its going to take two slam attacks against beau thats going to be a  nine to hit  marisha miss  matt thats going to be a 17 to hit  marisha miss  matt both large giant slam fist towards hitting the water causing these giant splashes but no  impact on you that finishes its turn that brings us now to zsundies turn zsundie is going to go  ahead and angle over this actually hes going to angle right where it is you watch as it brings  its hand /none/ forward and theres this tiny little spiral of dull greenish energy that turns into a  jet of really fastpowered water that shoots out in a 60foot line yasha caduceus and caleb i  need you all to make dexterity saving throws please  travis not everybody just in that line  matt just in that line  taliesin nope four  liam 16  ashley i rolled a natural one but i do now have fanatical focus  matt yes  ashley so if you fail a saving throw while youre raging and im not  matt youre not /none/ raging yet no  ashley natural one  laura and sam oh no  matt that will be 24 points of bludgeoning damage you take half that so you take 12 but  thats 24 to caduceus and 24 to yasha youre both pushed 20 feet away and knocked prone  travis 20 feet away two zero  marisha 20 feet  matt yes caleb gets pushed back to there  liam i get pushed even though i saved  matt actually no you are not pushed caleb  sam that means im going to slam into you  matt /none/ yep which means they all slam into you you actually hold that position ill say for the  purposes of the narrative here you do get knocked prone from their impact  laura but it keeps them from going back  matt yeah you all dont get shot out of the room but all three of you are knocked prone on  the ground caleb taking the brunt of two of his larger teammates  liam flipping somersault up in the air  sam those are some big fellas  matt with that hes going to shift over into this /none/ direction thats going to finish his turn  caduceus youre up  sam and marisha zsundie  matt zsundie  marisha zsundie with a j  sam im spelling it zh  liam like zsa zsa  matt zsundie  taliesin im going to get up and be like man ive got to get that bracelet off that guy god ugh  im going to  sam where hes from these are bracelets and these are necklaces  taliesin im going to try and get up and crawl around into the corner right there get as far into  the /none/ corner am i within 60 feet of algar  matt counting unfortunately thats as far as you can get is right up against yasha  taliesin am i 60 feet from algar  matt you dont know you have to eyeball it  taliesin motherfucker uh  matt its a little dicey  taliesin it is a little dicey thats as far as i can move  matt yeah because you used half your movement to get up from prone  taliesin then i have no damn movement  matt youre moving through the water  taliesin okay im going /none/ to lets see first thing im going to do is oh man im so sorry i  dont quite have my shit together  matt fjord youre up next by the way  taliesin im going to use my blight staff  im going to use my bonus action to cast the swarm  matt all right  taliesin im going to use it to get how far away  matt the beetles are swimming on the surface  taliesin well i mean they fly  matt oh yeah  taliesin i figure theyre flying noise so flying beetles  /none/ matt theyre coasting over  taliesin theyre going to go irritate the other side of the water monster at the moment  matt so right there  taliesin no the water  matt okay over there its harrying it so  taliesin then for my attack hmm  matt you can roll their attack if you want to  taliesin oh yeah thats uh sorry thats a weird little i actually dont have their attack  information still  matt oh its a  taliesin plus what its a bite attack i know i dont we havent fixed it yet /dung/  matt its okay well get that fixed in the app its plus three to hit so go ahead and roll an  attack to hit  taliesin no thats an eight  matt that does not hit unfortunately but you now have a swarm of beetles now here in this dark  underground area  taliesin for my actual action im going to put im going to use one of my channel divinities  matt okay  taliesin on the water creature just to just for now im going to cast the path to the grave  matt okay /none/  taliesin and then thats my turn  matt that finishes your go fjord youre up  travis okay im going to try some shit  taliesin the next person who hits that water thing is going to hurt  travis can i use my 30 feet to run by this creature to this area  matt sure yeah because you dont have to worry about that so you can go counting 30 is as far  as you can get  travis okay  matt it will get an attack of opportunity on you as you move  travis /none/ ill take it  matt so as you rush by whoof reaches out with a heavy  marisha sentinel attack  matt thats a natural 20  all oof  taliesin im going to undo that  matt oh because you have a reaction that can do that thats right  taliesin none of that shit  marisha can i sentinel that bitch since im next to it and its attacking someone whos not me  matt you can  liam yeah whats that power tal  taliesin im trying to find it again  matt its an ability of /none/ the grave cleric so thats just a regular attack there so thats  going to be zsundi zsundi 13 points of bludgeoning damage to you fjord on the back of  your shoulder as you lunge forward but you make it to your space  travis did you roll to hit  matt it still hits as a natural 20 but its just not a critical hit  taliesin i can cancel that  travis 13 points got it  matt that would have been a little harsher so what are you doing  travis okay so  matt youre /none/ up next yasha  travis would you say thats about 30 feet to here  matt it looks like its pretty close youd have to give it a shot  travis all right grasping the falchion im going to use my bonus action to cast misty step  and try to fwoomp  matt oh its a bonus action yeah counting 30 with the height that gets you right there  sam oh no fjord ten bucks you get defenestrated  marisha i rolled a 14 to attack the water elemental  matt that just hits  marisha not great /none/ six damage  taliesin and technically its also divinity  matt that was with your staff or with your fist  marisha staff  matt all right its also halved  marisha shit i should have just punched it  matt well now you know youre remindedoh it seems to resist nonmagical impacts  taliesin did the divinity get pulled then from that  matt no so yeah that would have been an attack it takes six damage and the vulnerability goes  away so it does full damage  marisha did i just waste something  taliesin kind of /none/ something that nobody understands yet that i should probably explain to  people at some point  matt yeah but tactically youll figure it out in the future  taliesin oh god now im thinking  matt thats okay now you know that brings us to fjords turn  travis i appear on the platform i look around and say hey kids you just fucking couldnt  leave well enough alone and ill take the falchion and ill shove it in the ground and cast  thunder step  sam ooh  laura yeah  sam thunder step whats thunder /none/ step  travis they take 3d10 damage and this cacophonous thunderous boom  sam its not thunder wave  travis no thunder step and i jump 90 feet in any direction  sam whoa  marisha what  ashley whoa  matt all righty yeah thatll do it all right so  marisha yeah  matt technically you didnt even have to use your bonus action to misty step there  travis i didnt  matt no when you using the action you teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within  range and immediately after you disappear /none/ actually no the boom happens when you teleport  no youre right you did it right  travis oh phew  matt so where do you want to land  travis i want to land on this platform over here  marisha thats so cool  matt you watch as fjord teleports speaks for a second and then where he vanishes theres this  blast of thunderous energy the moisture in the air is evaporated from the impact causing this  faint misty orblike power like that thank you taliesin  taliesin i had to  matt constitution saving throw /none/ to each of them so go ahead and roll damage on that one  travis yeah its a constitution 15 is the save  matt got you thats cocked thats a failure on one of the guards so total 15 you said  travis 15 for the save and 19 points of damage  matt 19 points of damage failure on both guards  ashley yes  travis i did something  marisha you did it it was so good  matt algar does succeed though he rolled a 16 he takes half damage  travis he does  ashley /none/ that was awesome  travis yeah  marisha that totally was that was

the other one curves around to look at you for a  second you see this dull glow where its sentient eyes would be and is now focused on each of you  does that end your turn yasha  ashley yeah  matt all

here  sam oh no hes escaping  marisha little dick  matt thats going to end his turn he doesnt want to get too far away from his bodyguards that  brings us to caleb  liam okay so caleb springs up out of the water and i think from where i am i have a direct /none/ line  of sight to that corner that he just went around yeah because theyve got light up there  matt there you do yes  liam yeah i am

guys thats twice  matt however this blast of fire rocks the interior of the chamber you watch as both of the  bodyguards grunting and panting look up at themselves you can see their skin is burned  in areas its cracked a little bit and they look over towards algar look out towards you and you  see him defensively moving back towards his position  liam i will walk 15 feet backward into the tunnel im in bane voice i will walk 15 feet  backward  matt all right that ends calebs go jester youre /none/ up  laura okay im going to walk forward as far as i can like here can i get here  matt from there

cheering  matt go ahead and /none/ roll some damage on that one  taliesin and liam chainsaw noises  laura did that work did i chop off his arm because thats what i was trying to do  matt you dont actually see him so youre hoping it hits across the wall  laura im hoping it hits him ten damage  matt technically i should have given you disadvantage because you cant see the target but  its fine ill let it go through there you go you hear groan across the wall you have no idea  to what effect it was but you /none/ hit something probably algar  laura my duplicate goes ha ha too  liam are you a fan of matisse  marisha right in the kidney  matt end your turn  laura yeah sure  matt all right top of the round nott youre up actually no the dwarves have to go still  the bodyguards rush over getting into the space that thats there pushing past to the heads  this way this one is going to move back and you dont know what this one does because hes moved  from your visual range but this one /none/ as it pulls back it has a large heavy crossbow and its  going to go ahead and take a shot at you jester from back here actually lets see no hes  going to shoot at caduceus because caduceus is already wounded and wants to try and take down  those who are already hit thats going to be against caduceus its going to be a 21 to hit  taliesin oh that hits  matt all right you take nine points of piercing damage  taliesin ow  matt thats all the damage you take and then it /none/ moves back and hides in this space here thats  going to go ahead and end that go now it is top of the round nott youre up  sam how can i control the mage hand with a bonus action can i move it and grab with it or just  grab with it its very vague  matt lets have a look here  travis read it sam whats it say on dd beyond  laura singing on dd  sam it says you can control the hand but i dont know if that means  matt the /none/ hand can move 30 feet each time you use it so it can move and do something  sam okay so who has the necklace zsa zsa zsundie  laura has a necklace on but algar has a bracelet on thats controlling it  sam i cant see algar but zsundie is the  matt its right there yeah  sam hes wearing a necklace i will bonus action try to steal his necklace  matt all right go ahead and roll an arcana check  sam arcana check  matt yep  sam 19 i dont get sleight of /none/ hand or anything  matt its less of a necklace and more of a large metallic band that is around the neck like a  collar  laura its a collar  travis he aint stepping out in high fashion  sam 19  matt the hand reaches and grasps towards it and pulls but its locked in place theres no trick  to removing it that the hand seems to be able to deal with but its a good thought  sam i give him a purple nurple  laughter  sam and then ill back up a couple /none/ feet and fire at the big water blob does it get an attack or no  matt it does not have reach with its slam so no  sam okay ill fire  matt all right go for it  sam that is a 17 i believe  matt 17 hits go ahead and roll damage  sam 17 plus ill use fury of the small to add another six thats 23  matt nice 23 points of damage well done all right that finishes your turn that brings us to beau  marisha i am going to steel myself /none/ for a minute look at the water elemental to my right and then  cast step of the wind with a ki point and try and disengage like a rogue  sam singing like a rogue  matt step of the wind lets you move as a bonus action right  marisha it does but it says you can spend one ki point to take the disengage or dash action as a  bonus action  matt oh thats what it means gotcha so yeah you can disengage you use a ki point your bonus  action to disengage  /none/ marisha so i would have to take an attack of opportunity if i decided to dash instead of  disengage right  matt correct up to you  sam have any of you heard of marius lepual  laughter  matt whatre you doing beau  marisha im going to risk the hit and take the dash  matt all right so its going to swing towards you that is going to be an 18 to hit  marisha miss  matt whoosh just past you  marisha so my jump distance is also doubled for the turn can i /none/ be like parkour parkour and  jump im going to try and jump up here  matt okay its still your movement so if youre wanting to leap off and parkour all right so  well say thats about 20 feet to get there go ahead and make an acrobatics check  marisha is this disadvantage again or no im not rolling gil  matt this is still disadvantage because its slick  marisha thats a natural one  matt natural one so  sam dont you have a feat now fanatical fanatic  travis quietly thats yasha  matt /none/ so you land and slip right into the ground the water splashes youre underwater for a  second you use the rest of your step of the wind extra dash movement to get up from prone thats  your bonus actionyou still have your action and movement  marisha i move the rest of the way  matt all right counting  marisha i cant jump now i cant use that double jump distance is that done step of the wind  matt ill say if you wanted to try and vertical leap from here go ahead and make an /none/ athletics  check to see if given the circumstances of the turn you can make it  marisha okay 22  matt 22 ill allow you to just get the final distance on the edge and have to correct yourself  and then catch it on the ledge but thats the end of your movement there  marisha panting fuck you guys and im going to take my shurikens and pop pop  matt towards  marisha whoever i can see  matt you can barely see algar just around the corner threequarters cover and then theres the  protector /none/ who looks fairly hurt  laura did i chop off his hand can you tell  marisha who the dwarf  matt i mean they all look pretty hurt the fireball wrecked their world a little bit  marisha does it look like jester chopped off algars hand  matt no  marisha shouting no  laura damn it  marisha sorry ill go one for the dwarf one for algar pretty color for the dwarf balls so many  balls all the way around we have nine for the dwarf and we have 12 for algar  matt no /none/ unfortunately none of those hit so they ricochet off the stone walls and your foot is  still slick from having to balance on the edge and when you throw them both you have to compensate  and they both go wide but good try  travis good try  marisha fuck  sam no not a good try you failed  marisha i dont have any more bonus actions right or anything  matt no thats it thats your action bonus action and your movement so the elemental is  going to whelm into caduceus and yashas spaces  /none/ sam oh no  matt and its going to make  taliesin im very low well see how this goes  matt its going to make a whelm ability so each creature in its space i need you both to make  strength saving throws you have advantage because youre raging  sam come on caduce  taliesin nine  matt thats a failure  ashley 18  matt 18 thats a success so you are grappled until it ends you are considered restrained you  are unable to breathe and yeah thats it currently so youre restrained grappled unable /none/  to breathe  sam that seems nice its like a snuggie  matt you are pushed out of its space yasha so you are shoved out at a corner there you manage  to free yourself but caduceus you now see is swimming in this creature as its spinning around  its swirling like a giant water spout in the center of the chamber and this guy here is going  to go ahead and move out into this space and knowing what it summons its going to go ahead and  pull another water jet this one is /none/ going to go ahead and shoot through what it thinks is you  passes through nothing but its going to go for caduceus and caleb as well  caleb whats the distance  matt so this guy will move right up there counting yeah it hits you so i need you both  to make dexterity saving throws the water elemental has to as well and fails  taliesin dexterity saving throw  laura yes  taliesin come on nope  laura put that one away for a while  taliesin yup im putting it away im out  laura /none/ you dont know you dont know you dont know  sam what do you mean you dont know he just did the math  taliesin no i havent done the math yet but im pretty sure  matt so thats 25 points of damage  taliesin im out  liam heres a question nobody called dibs on the dodecahedron today could one of us since nobody did  matt you cant retract  liam so we just got to say every game we just have to make sure that we spit it out okay so i  fail i got /none/ a seven  matt all right so thats 25 points of bludgeoning damage to you caleb  liam im out  travis oh shit  taliesin guess whos going to be healing  laura oh fuck okay  sam no  marisha my worst nightmare  sam water  liam oh im not out because i have mollys necklace  marisha you have the necklace from molly  taliesin youre out youre just not doing death saves  matt youre unconscious but youre not making death saves youre stabilized  liam although im underwater  matt yeah you are  /none/ travis its one foot of water you probably fell on your back  matt no hes face down  travis god damn it  matt i mean  taliesin its got to keep stabilizing you i think  matt well you can still drown with it on but whats your constitution modifier  liam plus two  matt yeah you have like three minutes before you drown sitting there so youre okay for now  well say for just the purposes of like youre not sucking air in necessarily  liam right im unconscious and holding my breath  matt /none/ nah yeah youve convinced me out of it well get to it  liam i think thats the way to go  matt no thats right well go to constitution saving throws on your turn all right so  finishing that  marisha did you just talk matt out of it  liam yeah  marisha yeah thats cool  matt noticing that that is an illusion and seeing you across the wall  laura oh but can i make her like fall probably not because its not my turn  matt no its not so it turns away and /none/ goes underneath here and glances up towards beau you  see as it glides across the water at rapid speed it seems to travel very quickly through any sort  of water surface and can jump quite a bit that brings us to caduceuss turn at the top of your  turn because you are still whelmed i need you to make a death saving throw because you immediately  take damage as youre caught in the spiral of its whelm so you would take 2d8 plus four bludgeoning  damage but you just instantaneously lose a death save and /none/ its the end of your turn i need you to  make another death saving throw  sam oh my god this is happening again  taliesin yup 11 im good  matt thats a success  marisha 11  liam i also have a question about the periapt it says that whenever you roll oh its rolling a  hit die to regain hit points but it doesnt count when anyone heals me  matt no its only when youre using hit dice during a short rest  taliesin as long as laura throws yeah then  matt fjord /none/ youre up  marisha cant die twice in a row  travis yeah okay im a little shook its cool  matt what are you doing  travis im going to use my speed to just peek in the doorway just to get a visual on the hallway  i dont actually need to see them  matt okay so you can see the hallway behind here that continues back  travis im going to use my last of two spell slots to cast hunger of hadar 20 feet into the  hallway with just the brim just so it /none/ gets the yeah  matt all right so for that well say i finally get to use these  travis so i pop in the doorway and i reach up and grab a little bit of reality and i tear a  black hole in the hallway  marisha yes looney tunes style  travis yup  sam wait what  laura hes bringing out the hentai  liam cthulhus dick  travis you aint going nowhere motherfucker  sam you ever done this before  matt hes used the ability before yeah  laura but it was in darkness /none/ right so none of us actually saw it  travis everything in it is black so theyre blinded they cant hear anything  matt and what do they have to make saving wise  travis 15 dex save or they take 2d6 cold damage  matt go ahead and roll damage  travis six seven so seven points  matt seven points all right thats a natural 20 for the first bodyguard so it takes three points right  travis yep  matt all right the other bodyguard thats a natural 18 and then for algar that is a 14 /none/ so  he takes seven points of damage he goes unconscious  taliesin yes  travis algar does yeah  marisha fuck you  matt not that you know that  travis nope  marisha but i mean its fine its great  matt all right does that end your turn fjord  travis yes yeah im going to use the rest of my movement to just come back out here  matt okay step out to the point you got it all right that brings us to yashas turn  ashley okay so im going to attack this water /none/ elemental where i can if i can see an open spot  that caduceus is not in  matt caduceus is being swirled around on the inside his unconscious body just being kept with  the current so youre timing it for a moment and go for a swing  taliesin also technically wouldnt my beetles get a bonus action anyway or  matt the beetles they just have their attack increment they dont have the full action  spectrum  ashley wait do i get an extra roll  matt no its just a straight roll  taliesin i /none/ thought that was cocked anyway but yeah  matt so the first attack was what  ashley the first attack was 16 but it was cocked  matt oh it was cocked okay  ashley 19  matt 19 hits so go ahead and roll damage for that one  sam oh boy oh boy  laura that was such a gentle roll  travis like the flowers she collects  taliesin dont even im not rolling another character  ashley 18  matt 18 points of damage on the first strike you carve through you watch as a big /none/ piece of it  splashes away its looking hurt its not heavy but youre starting to see some wear and tear on  the creature you make your second attack  ashley does he look like hes getting loose at all  matt no it looks like hes still held in there  ashley oh fuck and i dont get to roll again right  matt no you dont have a means for getting advantage remember you have your reckless  strikes  ashley oh yes let me do reckless  matt is that what you wanted to do  /none/ ashley yeah  matt all right usually you say that at the top of the turn but its been a while so you can do that  ashley okay thatll definitely hit  yeah im sorry im out of practice guys  matt its all good its all good  ashley and im on east coast time okay 24  matt 24 hits yeah go ahead and roll damage  travis nice every little bit counts  ashley ooh okay 15  matt 15 with the second carve carving through you are now cutting away almost like its a  /none/ gelatin dessert and youre seeing the pieces sloughing off of it it reforms back slowly but  its starting to sputter and bits of it are having a hard time keeping itself as a full form you can  see foam gathering at the edges of it that finishes your turn are you going to move  ashley yeah because i cant take another attack  matt thats right the beetles would have probably clambered back into the staff when you  fell unconscious  taliesin aw man yeah  matt sorry buddy  taliesin its okay i was just /none/ hoping for even like advantage or some such  ashley im going to back up a little bit  matt youre going to back up  ashley well will it get an attack of opportunity  matt it will yeah  ashley okay ill just stay where i am  matt so you just continue engaged and holding it in that moment okay that ends yashas turn  algar is going to make a death saving throw thats a failure  marisha yeah stay dead stay dead  laura we dont want him to die  travis we dont  /none/ taliesin why not  sam he just was mean  travis i dont think he was clear on that  taliesin hes running a fucking undead  matt all right caleb your turn  liam so what do i do concentration check death save i dont know  matt no make a constitution saving throw  liam that is a six  matt that is a six were going to go ahead and say that you are in the beginning stages of  drowning so you can survive a number of rounds equal to your constitution modifier  liam so /none/ thats two  matt two rounds yeah  liam mmhmm  matt so you have two more rounds before you drown  laura okay okay  travis and when you drown do you then have three death saves or  matt nope  travis or are you dead or just two rounds in  taliesin if im alive its fine if im not alive its not okay  laura yeah yeah so dont worry  matt no yeah at the if you run out of breath or are choking you survive the number of rounds  equal to your constitution /none/ modifier at the start of your next turn you drop to zero hit points and  are dying  taliesin okay so its not terrible its bad  marisha and are dying not dead  matt it gets a little weird it gets a little weird here because youre stabilized youre  stabilized by the necklace  marisha dying is not dead though  laura so can he drown and then he stabilizes and then he drowns and stabilizes  matt kind of it gets a little weird  liam just do whatever feels right  laura thats must be /none/ stressful  marisha yeah yeah very  sam hes being waterboarded  matt it is yeah well say  ashley its waterboarding basically  matt kind of so yeah youre stabilized  liam all right  matt and youre fine physically  travis for two more rounds  liam well there are dragons in this world  matt well see where it goes well see where it goes in two rounds  liam sure  matt all right that ends calebs turn  liam i have faith in you jester  matt jester youre up  laura okay  sam /none/ its all up to you  laura im going to step forward im going to stay away from the water thing im going to use  my duplicate to go forward and touch caduceus  matt all righty  laura and shes going to cast cure wounds at third level  taliesin whoa  matt go for it  laura so thats 3d8  sam wow  travis dude i was sweating  marisha yeah  laura so that is counting 19 points of health  sam hey  taliesin mmhmm  laura and then with me im going to /none/ sacred flame for myself  matt well cure wounds is still an action so you cant do both in one round unfortunately  laura just kidding  giggling  laura im going to  matt spiritual weapon is still somewhere in those tentacles but you cant see where that is  laura im just going to flail around with the spiritual weapon and hope i hit something  matt make an attack with disadvantage  marisha can a tentacle wield the lollipop  matt well say that probably happens there  marisha yeah thats fun  all groaning  taliesin /none/ goddamn it it was so good  laura its okay its a 15 but the other one was a natural 20  matt oh got you  ashley groans  matt it unfortunately does not hit anybody because of the the one that it strikes has a  higher armor class than 15 but  travis i forgot something when algar starts his turn you take 2d6 cold damage so he was  liam he was dead  marisha gasps  taliesin technically  matt well no hes at two death saves  travis yeah hell be at two instead /none/ of one  matt yeah  marisha but i thought he takes down two when hes dead  liam no thats at a melee attack  matt thats a melee attack that does that  liam yeah  marisha ooh  matt okay that ends jesters turn  laura mmhmm  sam he wont even know why he was dead though we didnt even to tell him it was from  the ruby of the sea  travis i did  sam oh  marisha dont be a fucking creep  laura im going to move my own person towards /none/ caleb  matt yeah  laura yeah im going to move me towards caleb  matt okay  marisha its very extreme its very extreme  matt going past to get there the water elemental gets an attack of opportunity on you  laura oh he does  matt he does  laura oh i didnt realize it was within range  matt well now you know  liam hes a big guy  matt thats going to be a 17 to hit  laura he doesnt hit me  matt he doesnt hit you  laura i have a /none/ shield  matt clanging you shrug it off from your armor and shield  liam and laura clanging  matt thats your full movement there  laura okay  matt all right does that end your turn  laura yeah  matt that brings us to the compatriots here at the top of their turn they take how much damage  travis 2d6  laura gasps  matt 2d6 go ahead and roll 2d6 for both of the dwarven bodyguards  travis for both of the bodyguards  laura could i have used my hellish rebuke if he didnt actually /none/ hit me  matt you can use your reaction to you can yeah  laura yeah i want to use my hellish rebuke  matt well no if it didnt hit you i dont think does it say an attack or a hit i believe  it has to be a hit doesnt it when youre damaged  sam and laura actions  laura actions reactions  travis five points of acid damage  matt gotcha so those left standing  travis sorry full damage full damage  matt just barely full damage  travis they do take if they /none/ do their dexterity saving throw they take half again it says that  if you  matt oh dex save every turn  travis yeah  matt a success and a fail no both successes actually both rolled really high that round all  right so two damage to each actually all right and they cant see anything they both havent  moved since the last thing happened so one reaches down and you hear some rummaging he gets  dragged  travis their speed is halved  matt yeah  liam wilhelm scream  matt yeah no he cant /dung/ drag him out of there its not enough movement for him to get in so  ashley yes  travis its a big ass sphere  matt other ones just going to move into this space here  marisha so if you move into that sphere is it utter blackness  matt and travis yeah  marisha if i have dark vision goggles  matt and travis nope  marisha does it help  travis nope just blind errybody blind  travis rummaging around  matt you hear some more rummaging you hear a grunts what the fuck thats it /none/  liam thats what id do  laura yeah screams ahh  matt sounds like algars voice  travis okay oh nice  laura sounds like what  liam oh fed him a potion  matt his bodyguards

sam hes just been a little annoying  laura you defend your mom  taliesin it got bigger /none/ when we got in here thats my feeling  marisha dont fuck with someones mom  sam i dont know whats going on with caleb so i will move over toward yasha  matt all right  sam check in on my boy  matt hes currently facedown floating in the water  sam ahh  laughter  sam i see jester over there and i know that

good chance you were going to lose a tooth or two  liam yep just deepthroated it /dung/  marisha could have made you more charming  matt so go ahead and roll heal for caleb  sam i roll heal what do i

damage right  laura half damage okay so thats still 3d10 of cold damage  sam thats a lot you could freeze it  travis and cold damage hurts more  matt yeah reduces its speed by /none/ 20 feet until the end of its next turn  laura counting 11  matt 11 points of damage  sam okay that was i wouldnt say hellish  matt as it reaches and gets a little frozen and its movement is a little sluggish its looking  really hurt  laura and what was it 13 damage  matt 13 points of bludgeoning damage and because technically caduceus is still  sam oh no  matt at the top of the turn no because you got healed by jester so you also take 13 points of  bludgeoning damage /none/  laura okay were still alive  taliesin yep still alive  matt so thats going to end  taliesin thats all i needed was just to survive

/none/ and dies this  darkened shadow begins to tug and drag out of its body you watch as this spectral ghost that has  faint barnacles and elements of dripping sea foam and thick ocean water drooling out of its jaw  emerges and stands over going sinister breathing  ashley oh thats awesome  travis i didnt know it was going to do that  matt algar right now is if it wasnt so generally wet in the chamber you could see the  puddle forming under him he is bludgeoned beaten slimed within an inch of his life /none/ and is  looking at the specter looking at you and is like fearful noises  travis do not move  matt for his turn he is going to cower he is just going to put his hands up and try and drag  and put his back against the wall and is just sputtering unable to make a word that brings us  to calebs turn  liam could you clarify a rule for me because ive never tried to do this as a new magic user  newish but to do a bonus action firstlevel spell could that /none/ be done in addition to a second  or a third i know theres a version of being able to cast two spells at once if ones lower than the  other but i cant remember what it is  matt its a spell of firstlevel or higher and a cantrip  liam and a cantrip okay so forget that  matt there is a feat you can take at level eight to do what you did in the last campaign  liam not interested so caleb pushes up and if were in difficult
