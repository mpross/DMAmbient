in now back to tonights episode of critical role guys pay  attention  liam illithid syphilis  matt the cameras already on  liam yeah okay  matt so our intrepid band of adventurers vox machina found themselves recently traversing the  feywild in search of another vestige of divergence in doing so they managed to find an  old friend in the nymph nahla acquired some information /none/ trading a book and found their way  towards the evershifting grasses northward in search of where the divergence the object of the  divergence lies in doing so they found a new ally a new friend a little satyr by the name of  where is it here  all garmelie  matt garmelie thank you now garmelie who had made some really interesting sketches of the party  upon being caught was then dragged into scanlans magnificent mansion at which pike asked him to  make a fantastic mural for the interior of that place which i think /none/ still resides there to this  day and on the internet as weve discovered upon traveling further north hopefully to find  their final destination in the form of the shademirk bog where the fenthras bow seemingly  exists you instead came upon syngorn the city from the youthful days of vex and vax upon  speaking to the head pardon me you see all the nerves gets the belching out it works out well  upon encountering watcher iova watching the gate recognizing the twins let them within the actual  city of syngorn and that is where we /town/ left off so as you guys walk through the beautiful verdant  city tall seemingly endless trees around you many buildings naturally formed and built from  smoothly carved stone various ancient sigils carved throughout the entire cityscape the very  heavyarmored verdant guard gathered in places and a general air of intensity and building  military might within the city of syngorn you have your invisible companion garmelie who at  some point in the near future agreed to tell you what it is he wishes you to steal for him as part  of the deal that was /none/ made by the twins so what would you like to do  liam i feel like i should be very stern right now but i cant stop smiling  travis youre gloomy lock it up here we go  laura i feel like the first thing we need to do is go see our father  liam right off the bat  laura hes the one thats going to give us access to the rest of the city  liam all right is iova still here or has she trundled off  matt shes walked off she literally let you /none/ guys in the city and went do what youve got to do  and then turned away and the rest of the guards  laura oh seriously so like no no the guard is following us  liam and we remember where were going right because its all the same as it was  matt the city is the same as it was  liam well i imagine wed go to his home our home his home  laura what time is it i mean we dont know what time it is  taliesin its dusk  laura thank you /none/ percy  sam but we just woke up  laura all right okay  liam look at all those elves  laura so many elves  travis is the little satyr is he holding onto my skirts basically  matt you actually dont feel a general presence and then as you move you feel a  slight tug at your belt  travis right so can i like how far away is that guard thats on our tail  matt about 15 20 feet back  travis oh yeah can i like super slyly whisper okay so at any point /none/ are you going to tell us  what it is you want us to fucking steal  matt you hear a whispered voice that curls up by your ear strangely given the fact that hes so  small so the voice is being thrown right into the side of your eardrum goes just be quiet find a  place in which we can speak privately and then i will be happy to tell you shh stop talking to  the air it upsets them  travis its really quite normal for me  laura hey grog you should really watch /none/ that gas of yours with him back there  travis oh youre so right hey pull my finger fart sound  matt coughs  travis yeah thats the family reserve oh he said were supposed to find somewhere  quiet to talk  liam maybe we should do that first actually  laura we have guards fucking following us we have to go find our father  taliesin we also dont know where were sleeping tonight or whether or not its even permissible  we should probably have a conversation with whoevers in charge is your father in charge  /town/ liam no  laura ish  taliesin ish  liam hes a bureaucrat  taliesin excellent  laughter  liam all right lets go see dad then  marisha whispers grog  travis what  marisha whispers your pants theyre sagging a little bit why  travis what  marisha whispers theyre sagging  travis oh its like the new rage amongst the kids it gives me super street cred  marisha wheres garmelie  laura keyleth shut up about garmelie  travis yeah ixnay on the garmelie i think im doing pig latin wrong yeah  liam its this /none/ way and i start walking off towards dads house  taliesin im going to follow the twins  sam sounds good  marisha i look regal and as we pass elves i say good day  matt the few that look in your direction keyleth take a moment to nod look you over and  then continue walking seemingly perturbed by the sudden interaction and the immediate realization  that youre not of full blood  laura yeah sorry keyleth your ears arent large enough  marisha thats not normally what people tell me  sam its not the size /none/ of your ears  marisha thats right  matt so as you guys continue following vaxildan towards the abode of their father you keep an eye  out towards the rest of syngorn proper you see the further into the city you go interspersed with  a few emon guards you see a handful of individuals that are human and theyre dressed in  the actual attire of the guards of emon and theyre intermingling right now with the verdant  guard the military might within syngorn  marisha what were the name of the guards in emon did they /none/ have a name  matt the emon guard  marisha yeah totally  matt there is a name and its somewhere in my notes but were good  taliesin from this perspective i can see your panic folder its so exciting thats where the  magic happens  marisha yeah thats true we never really see that  taliesin this is exciting for us  laughter  matt so you guys continue making your way towards the abode after traversing on the  outskirts of what would be the tangleward side of the city the eastern side you travel in /town/ through  an area of buildings that are very beautifully crafted many of which seem to have stemmed from  some sort of a tree growth but upon closer look you can see that its actually carved stone to  resemble a tree and then it eventually rises up into a somewhat spherical building and there are  many that build off of that to create this kind of neighborhood of various elven abodes within  syngorn  liam fucking hate this place  laura me too its hideous  marisha this is gorgeous look at the craftsmanship its incredible /town/  sam good day  marisha good day  matt you make your way towards the end of this particular  laughter  matt the guards still keeping track behind you you find your way to the end of the main road and  it splits into two smaller avenues you know to take the left that leads deeper into the more  political family houses of syngorn while your family is not a political house per se your  father as an ambassador to emon was given a home in this location it is your old home although it /none/  appears to have been even further renovated and is much nicer than you remember but the door is  closed and the dusk sun leads you to pause as you look upon the outside of this abode you have not  seen in many many years  sam do you want me to burn it down  laura yes  travis no just seriously you seem super gloomy are we getting in a fight  laura no no fights  matt the guards now step up and flank a little bit keeping a close eye as youve now approached /none/ and  effectively knocked on the handle of a relatively middletohighranking individual within syngorean  society eventually the door opens and you see a woman standing there bright blonde hair braided  and tied up in the back shes wearing more of a workgown for the day you recognize her as  devana the new wife of syldor the one that you had once met before in emon when you guys came  upon your father last time as the door opens up she looks out for a second taking in the whole  group that has gathered on the /none/ outside of their home and goes my god vaxildan vexahlia we  werent expecting you  laura no i cant imagine you were is he here  matt he is  laura what time is it  matt she glances out looks up thats always a good question the longer we stay in these realms  the more confused my daughter becomes  liam how long has that been  matt weeks now i assume best that our timepieces can keep  laura is velora around  matt she is would you like to see her  laura of course /none/  matt come in is it just you two  laura and liam no  laura its everyone  travis hi  laura and trinket you remember trinket  matt bear noises nudges your arm to the side and comes forward and sniffs out to devana she  shrinks back a little bit and reaches her hand out to the nose and taps the edge of trinkets face  and trinket licks her fingers  marisha good day  sam good day  marisha good day they respond better if you say good day and if you have your head /none/ up  travis if we say bidet  marisha bidet yes good day  travis bidet  taliesin so close so very close  matt the two guards closest to you within their helmets their eyes narrow they look at each other  and shake their heads  travis oh bidet  liam your accent is perfect dont change a thing  matt devana goes very well if you would all proceed to be quiet if you could syldor is  working and you may stay outside she says to the guards  and they both we were given orders /none/ milady to  i understand that but this is already a lot of people in our home stay close within earshot  itll be fine i trust them the guards sighs  laura i wink at them as i walk inside  matt no reaction whatsoever you guys make your way into the home and are immediately caught with  a very strong smell of cedar its a very pleasantsmelling home and the hearth is warm  its everything you wanted your home to be and it immediately hits you to walk in here and see this  kind of /none/ life away from a life seeing elements of it that remind you of your childhood things about  it that flag memories to your head of good times and bad in just a few mere moments and at that  same time theres a sadness because so much of it has changed so much of it seems better than the  memory and for a moment there you feel a little tinge of wondering how different it mightve been  at which point that thought process is broken as devana steps in and goes  would anyone like tea perhaps /none/  sam sure yes do you have an oolong  marisha maybe a chamomile it would be great  matt something like that yes its been a little scarce in the feywilds more difficult to  farm herbs here than youd think  marisha oh here i pull out some herbs that i brought from my garden  some glisfoil and other things  matt thank you appreciate that  marisha they wont scream at you when you pick them good its good  matt thank you what was your name again  marisha oh im keyleth of the ashari /none/  matt a pleasure to meet you again  marisha good day  matt thats thats really not necessary in my home you sir your name  taliesin whatevers available would be just fine  sam and marisha i think she means your name  matt thats a curious title  marisha but you can call him whatevers available as well  matt very well coffee table whats your name  laughter  liam its easier than the actual name  taliesin for you it is just percival and i am another visiting royal from mans world  matt all /town/ right you sir  sam i am called the kingslayer chuck norris burt reynolds i have many names you see when  youve traveled a road as long as i have  matt black tea got it and you sir the large one  travis oh yeah bidet the name is grog  matt very well ill return with syldor once he knows youre here it may be a while if you dont  mind waiting but the tea will come out posthaste  laura and velora wheres she  matt let me get her for you shell be very /none/ like to see both of you she asks from time to time  she brushes a little lock of hair thats fallen in front of her face behind her ear and smiles and  darts off towards the kitchen a few moments pass with you guys sitting in awkward silence looking about  the space in the vicinity looks to the twins eventually devana comes out and sets tea for all  of you across the central table in this meeting area and behind her you see clutching the edge  of the skirt you see this tiny long brown /none/ hair that is braided but the braids coming undone  tomboyish looking elven girl that peeks around the side of her dress and hides  again behind the back  highpitched noise  matt welcome back sorry about that  cheering  sam what a battle  matt the technical aspects were working through it but we got through it thank you for your  patience so the last few minutes were not quite sure how much you guys may have missed but the  party wiped were rolling up new characters no for the monday episode well go ahead /dung/ and make  sure to splice in anything that may have been missed for the past minute but the party had come  to the home of syldor the father of vax and vex they had a brief discussion with devana his new  wife they were given tea after introductions and then briefly discussed the merits of being a  warrior with their halfsister velora vessar and upon discussing apparently a war of some kind  syldor made his way into the room and you look and you see the long dark hair of syldor his pale  complexion /dung/ his stern face staring back at you all from within the doorway as he closes it behind  him and steps into the room you see devana sits up now and comes over to him and says  my dear would you like us to leave you alone  he goes dont worry it will be fine have a seat besides were all family  well some of us at least  and he looks over to grog  travis bidet  laughter  matt good day indeed he comes up and sits and hes wearing long dark brown robes /dung/ with  golden and red embroidery on the side but its very casual home wear and he sits down pulling  up a chair across from you guys in this area and takes one of the cups of tea and sips it and you  can see theres an intensity to his face hes here and he looks like hes partially  inconvenienced by your presence like he always did but he also looks like he hasnt slept well  theres some dark circles under his eyes and he seems a little distracted for such a climactic  remeeting  /none/ laura surprise  matt surprise indeed so its good to see you both glad youre in good health youve come  quite a ways to come speak with me being as we currently reside within the feywild  liam its a little bit further than we thought wed have to travel why the presence around  the city were seeing we understand why you fled but whats going on  matt look we had the entire fort daxio army down here and we were to give aid to push into the  nearby mountain range where apparently there was an /none/ influx of lizardfolk had been a continuous  problem and apparently a break had been seen somewhere however we had sent most of our forces  into the mountain range and then received word that three great drakes were making their way  straight toward syngorn after the destruction of emon knowing that we had no recourse but to flee  and prepare when it was time had we stood our ground we would be the same burning crater that  your fair city is now  laura so you intend to go back youre amassing this army to go /none/ back and join the fight  matt that is exactly what were doing the remnants of the emon army we currently have here  in the city weve been building armor and weapons to make sure the most surefooted and  strongofarm men and women of our fair city can make it to that battlefield  and tear that beast down  laura thats wonderful news  matt good why are you here  taliesin we are here on a very similar range of business to be honest  matt and you are  taliesin ah yes percival fredrickstein von /none/ mussel klossowski de rolo iii of the royal house  of whitestone representative of mans world here on very important business dealing with dragons  we are looking for some objects a few things that may help us in our fight against these dragons  that have attacked us weve already made headway against them and weve already made headway on  our quest to destroy them any help that your wonderful city could provide would be most  agreeable  matt well we currently have all of our resources engaged in our plans of attack there is  not /none/ much we could offer you other than if you wish to stay here within the city we could  provide a place to sleep food and when the time is right you may join our ranks into the fray  liam weve come to the feywild for something specific  marisha were trying to head to the shademirk bog  matt why on earth would you be heading to the shademirk  marisha were looking for the bow of fenthras it supposedly lives inside of a cancerous tree  matt right well good luck with that  laura do you /none/ think its possible  matt i think its a fools errand to chase a fleeting rumor into a location that is known to  devour and destroy anyone who steps within its bounds but by all means youve always been ones  seeking the darkness  liam he and i are wearing fleeting rumors that ones got one hidden up his butt  laughter  matt you hear velora chuckle devanas like shh quiet  laura i want to pull velora over and sit her in my lap  matt she raspberry noise at her mom as you pick her /none/ up there you can see devana smiles as she  does so  liam syldor we have killed two of these dragons already nothing could please me more to hear that  you are amassing forces here to go back that is possibly the greatest thing ive ever heard you  say to me  laura i want to insight check him and see if hes really saying  travis yeah do that shit  matt roll an insight check  liam him or me  laura 26 on him  matt all right id whisper but the microphone makes /none/ it useless its fine he appears tired he  appears like a lot of his intention and time has been put towards something important  laura being a giant dick  matt possibly but he doesnt appear to be lying or fudging the truth at all hes just tired he  says look there are a lot of pieces at work here if you have your own path by all means and  while i have heard of some of your exploits and i am quite impressed i hate to be blunt but its  difficult and strange to mingle /none/ family new and old your presence here brings up difficult  memories for me  laura oh you poor man  liam dont worry were not here to look for family that would entail some amount of  investment on either our side or yours there is clearly none we are here to do business do you  know where the bog is  matt yes its duskward of here  sam duskward  travis fucking shit  liam well some people go this way and some people go that way and some people go both ways  marisha its /none/ like being on a ship forever  matt i have not traversed this land extensively ive been here working along with the heads of the  city to make sure we are ready for this attack  laura when do you plan to attack  matt a few weeks  laura youre joining other armies you dont plan to fight thordak on your own  matt well there is an attempt to join up with the remnants of the fort daxio force they have  not gone to emon themselves and they currently reside camped out near where syngorn usually /none/ is  we have a few groups that are set on the other side of the veil in the prime realm and they are  keeping an eye out for this a few scouting parties are in emon as we speak trying to gather  intel on thordak himself once we have that information and we can formulate what to expect  then we can attack  marisha so youre trying to go after thordak himself thats your first target thordak  matt hes currently the largest threat to our safety our home and our return dont think this  /none/ is the first time a red dragon of that size has been felled there have been ancient ages of  various deaths from his people its not impossible but we need to be ready  travis just a headsup pro tip dragons can fly  laughter  matt and i take it youre their leader  travis of the dragons  laughter  matt he very slowly sighs while grabbing his tea  travis ive clearly lost your father its all right  laura his intelligence is very low grog  taliesin in the interest of dealing with thordak we /none/ are going to need access to libraries any of  your people who may know something about this bog and accommodations befitting those of us who are  titled  sam as well as access to certain parts of the city we need some items to acquire within the  city before we set out  marisha also it would be nice to find shelter for those of us who are not titled  sam and i had asked for an oolong tea  laughter  sam this is more of an assam i would say a black tea  /none/ taliesin this is technically what you do though isnt it  matt devana says im terribly sorry i didnt mean that  marisha no not you  matt syldor crosses his fingers together and i can give you a letter that will grant you entry to  a few of our general storehouses however most of you are outsiders and others have been ostracized  in their own right  taliesin but you will respect titled entry those of us who are court can converse with court  matt your title your court is unfamiliar with me i doubt it /town/ will hold sway within this town  this city this entire realm but you speak of great importance are you the leader of this  troop he who brings up words of courts and titles  taliesin for the moment why not i will say i know the feywild by reputation and by reputation  you are known for your manners and any kingdom should be measured by manners as the currency that  is the easiest to come across  matt manners by the way are extremely effective in times of peace this is not one of  those /none/ times however i appreciate that you at least acknowledge the way things sometimes work  so daughter son what else do you need of me  liam honestly nothing  laura we dont need or want anything from you  matt yet you still came to my home  laura oh well yeah we got what we wanted which is access to the city  liam were not here to be friends or rekindle anything but it seems like we want the same  thing in a roundabout way we want to end these dragons we want to return the /none/ world to what it  once was any help you can give in spite of our past in spite of all the bullshit between us will  be appreciated by more than just she and i  laura we know you have no love for us think of those you do love and i hug velora dont you  want to make her safe  matt thats exactly what i intend to do if you wish to help in that then so be it ill pull  what i can within the city sighs just leave me to my business /dung/ please you see for a moment  there for all the facade all the front that he puts up that strong distance facade you see the  fatigue break through and theres a like a dark heartbreak this is a greater threat than weve  ever faced in our lifetime and many of those in this city have lived quite a while we have to do  things right dont be foolish too many lives have been lost at the hands of these dragons some  closer than others  laura do you know of anyone that has traversed more /none/ of the feywild that would know of what we  might expect  matt one whos seen the most would be the high warden i could probably get you passage to see  her but youre going to be heavily guarded you guys do know the high warden tyrelda is her  name and she is actually of the bloodline of gynlara who founded syngorn centuries ago she  currently is essentially the de facto leader though in terms of public she is the final  decisionmaker on most of syngorns political and social endeavors will that suffice  liam /none/ it will  laura it will  sam good day  marisha good day  laughter  matt curious manners your friends he takes his tea and pours another cupful and leans back  in his chair two dragons you say youve killed  liam thats right  laura more than that isnt it  travis of the conclave  laura of the conclave weve killed two  matt which ones  laura umbrasyl and what was the other one  liam blitzen  laura blitzen donner what was the name of the other one oh it was general krieg /none/  marisha yeah that one  laura the blue one  marisha and then weve also killed a white one  sam we thought so little of him we didnt even remember his name  laughter  liam brimscythe  marisha brimscythe thats the one  sam but also we respect him enough to learn his name  matt well your story has charm i have to admit i have gotten word of at least one dragon  felled on the other side  marisha i pull out a dragons tooth from umbrasyl out of my pocket and i toss /none/ it to him thats the  result of the doings of your children you should be very proud  matt i am proud i am proud but the city lives differently understand the difficulty that your  presence puts upon our family with you being here i mean no disrespect and its fine in this trying  time but while you two may have undergone much ridicule in your youth i saved you from the brunt  of it  laura you headphones dear you fucked some random woman in a city you passed through and you  expect us /none/ to feel sorry for you  liam you shouldve left us to be with our mother when she died  laura why why pull us away from her if you had no love we would have been happy with her  matt because i had hope that you would be worth more given that you had my blood in your veins  than to waste away in some small hovel  laura if i could pull the blood of you from my veins and give it back i would  i want no part of you  matt there are /none/ many things we wish for but we have no choice but to take what we are given and  make the best

that from  a soldier  taliesin youve never really been in war have you  matt the door opens from the far study and you see syldor walk back in holding what looks to be a  rolledup piece of paper with a seal on it he heads over and tosses it onto the /none/ table that  will grant you passage through the city that will grant you a single meeting with the high warden  thats the most my power can do

up and at this point devana enters beside him puts her hand on his shoulder he  looks to you with his hands crossed before him and goes i wish you luck and safe journeys i  appreciate you coming by it was good to see you both  liam where did our sister go  matt turns and devana goes shes in her room for using bad language  laura poo is a really terrible word to say i think /none/ good thing she didnt say any of the other  words that she heard in here  matt hold on and she leaves and comes back this time pushing velora from the back and velora  walks up pouting with her arms crossed holding her little owlbear under her arm  liam come here  matt she runs up and gives you a big hug are you leaving  liam yeah just for a little bit though  matt you just got here  liam i know listen do me a

matt she runs back to her moms side and looks at her mom and goes poo  laughter  matt devana rolls her eyes and goes ugh thank you so much  liam shits a good word too  matt covers her ears  travis are

travis bidet  marisha and taliesin good day  matt good day /none/ and syldor bows you all slowly leave the door and right before the door closes  behind you hear a little voice go shit  laughter  matt no the door closes  marisha were those terribleinfluence side of the family arent we  laura i run up and i give percy the biggest hug percival  taliesin its the gift of smugness it never goes away  laura wait is it real no was it all just to  taliesin no i actually it occurs to me that we did kill two of the three barons of whitestone the /none/  last time that we were there  laughter  taliesin theres no house and theres no money  marisha its the one scanlan burned  taliesin its the one that scanlan burned  sam oh youre the lady of the house that i burned down  taliesin and theres just a crypt and thats being used for other things but  marisha but you have a title  taliesin but you do have a title at the very least and once a year you have to do something  ridiculous  laura even so percy  taliesin youre welcome /none/  laura i thank you so much  taliesin use it in good health  travis i lean over to scanlan and i say did you notice that their dad was saying bidet wrong  sam i did i did  travis i thought he was like a highfalutin type  sam you should just say it even louder to make sure people know the correct pronunciation  travis i know we could be a force for good in and outside of the city bidet  sam bidet  matt the guards that are waiting for you outside of the /none/ house just sigh very loudly sighs  travis change is hard  matt all right so you have your parchment within the next halfhour or so its not difficult for  you guys to go ahead and find sleeping arrangements for the evening within syngorn  youre met for the most part with standoffishness and curiosity with your approach but upon showing  the paper there is a sudden realization and a formality that is brought to the conversation and  its you cant help but enjoy it the two of you you havent walked through syngorn and been  /none/ forcing people to show you the respect youve always wanted and there is something slightly  cathartic about that but you manage to find accommodations for the evenings rest the guards  proceed up into the secondary floor where your room is kept will not enter the room but  notify you that they will be staying outside of the doorway to ensure that both you are protected  and that you dont do anything crazy in the night  travis what  laura thats stupid  marisha were respectable  taliesin its adorable that they think they could stop /tavern/ us if we tried  marisha i know are we all in rooms next to each other are we in one room  matt its a series of rooms within what looks like it was at one time a military barracks that  has since been renovated its not really an inn or tavern there arent a lot of travelers that  come through syngorn that dont actually live there or have a home so its more being used for  storage but they cleared out an area and they put up beds and it looks syngorn storage room is /none/  pretty nice by the standards of like kymal or westruun so its not too bad  taliesin theres some art nouveau happening thats all i can really ask  marisha have they already locked us in our rooms  matt no youve just gotten to your rooms now so  travis were a very religious group and we like to have a family prayer  laura speaking of wait where the fuck is pike  sam oh shit  marisha she was right behind us  matt you all you all realize in the chaos and the tension of /none/ meeting your father  liam mustve gotten lost  travis no shes here  matt you catch a sudden flicker of divine energy in the space of the hallway near you the guards  step back looking a bit freaked out and grabbing their weaponry and you see a burst of pikes face  coming through her divine form and she says im sorry static disappears comes back  the wallscant maintain and her form vanishes once again  travis fucking verizon  laughter  laura great now well never have them as a sponsor thank you travis  liam /none/ go tmobile  matt go at no  marisha so can we have like a little family powwow in maybe one of the rooms before we all  tuck in for the night and you put the masking tape over each of our doors so we dont sneak into each  others rooms high school field trip yeah  sam i dont know any of those words  matt do as you wish well be here if you need us  travis do you need anything drinks  sam we need to talk to the little fucker  travis then /none/ oh what oh yeah well lets all head inside for prayer  laura actually  taliesin well need food and drink  laura guard one of you could you go get us some food were very hungry  marisha and wine maybe some wine  laura as a baroness im very used to getting food when i want it  matt one of the guards steps forward and says let me see that parchment once more please  travis thats not it  matt thats a belt buckle  laughter  liam my belt buckle  matt rolls it back /none/ up hands it back i will retrieve your necessary meal drink and other  requests you may have  liam chicken please  laura thank you i want anything but chicken  matt noted and noted and he turns around and leaves the three other guards standing outside of  your rooms to do about as you please  sam right so we pick the biggest room and we all enter it  matt its a twobedroom opposite sides and there is a window that has a beautiful view of the  central lake that sits at the center of /none/ syngorn the entire citys built around before it meets  the base of the mountain range that its buttressed against  sam titicaca  matt that sounds elvish but its not  sam no i just like saying that  matt door closes behind you guys  travis gormidi  matt theres a little flash a sparkle of arcane light as the satyr form goes breathes heavily  that was a little harrowing you didnt tell me you were going to bring me into the belly of the  beast so soon we didnt even talk about that was really /none/ good tea by the way  that was quite delicious  taliesin you were drinking our tea  matt very quietly  marisha i was wondering where my tea went  travis now hold on did you steal anything while you were in there  matt no  marisha garmelie  matt no  sam insightcheck him  travis insightcheck that bitch  sam natural one  laughter  matt he is about as hard to read as anyone youve come across in the feywild  marisha can i try  matt sure  laura i feel like we dont /none/ need an insight check to know he was lying  marisha oh i got a 17 im way more better than scanlan natural insight 28  matt 28 through his teeth  marisha i do a little entangling underneath of him and start checking his pockets tsa style  start giving him the frisk  matt these vines wrap up around his legs and hes like oh i was just  marisha into the pockets  travis just let it happen  laura where are the pockets  matt in his vest  marisha in his vest pockets  taliesin /none/ there better not be an owlbear in there or im going to be very upset  matt no you reach into one pocket its empty you reach into the other and your arm goes quite  far into the pocket farther than it should  marisha you little devil  matt what this is extremely degrading we had a deal its empty  marisha is this a pocket of holding i think about the fancy silverware that i mightve seen in  syldors house  matt nothing just an empty space  travis come on keep going  marisha i /none/ think of fancy teacups because he mentioned drinking tea  matt melodically nothing  marisha goddamn it  travis youve never stolen anything shit  laura think of gold think of gold keyleth  taliesin i cast friends  marisha i think of gold oh i think of gold sorry im not materialistic  taliesin were going to have to have a working relationship  laura why do you say that like it was a bad thing  marisha i mean im not im a barbie girl in a barbie world  laughter  matt he smacks the side of /none/ your arm and is like get your hand out of my pocket  marisha ow  liam keyleth check the fur  laura no dont check the fur  matt excuse me  taliesin lets give him a chance to fess up  matt this is not why were here to talk we are here to discuss the elements of our agreement two  things i require your aid in taking and then i show you to the outskirts of the shademirk  laura i feel like now we already know where the outskirts of the shademirk are  matt /none/ but do you know of the dangers that are on your way  sam yeah you told us about all three dangers that we have to face  marisha thats true i have them written down  laughter  marisha the hut of wodenna the last camp of sorudun the happy and the theatre  matt and you think those are all the dangers there are so many its a dangerous place  stop touching me  travis all right hands off him  sam just tell us what the two things are we that we need to steal  /none/ matt all right i require a piece of a threshold crest  laura what the fuck is that  marisha of a threshold crest  liam giant stones on the outside of the city  matt threshold crest which you recall are the blue stones that are in the wall around the city  laura thats the stupidest thing  marisha oh no  matt why is that stupid  laura because then they cant go back  matt you dont have to get it from the wall im sure they build it from something and there might  be /none/ a reserve somewhere  marisha right in the other dimension that they came from you realize syngorn didnt originate  here in the feywild right  matt i understand but just  marisha oh lord have oh sweet sarenrae  taliesin wait okay a threshold a piece  matt a piece of a threshold crest just but a sliver  liam the same material  matt the same material enchanted that is functionally able to be  utilized in the same fashion  travis no problem what else  matt great i also want the high warden tyreldas hat  /none/ travis her hat  laura do we know what her hat looks like  matt you do actually  laura what does it look like  matt its a pointed small tricorn made of green velvet that she wears when she goes on like  excursions outside of the city  marisha oh my god shes got a pirate tricorner hat  matt its small and very long imagine a pirate hat with a little more of an  elven sleekness to it  laura wait like a robin hood hat like peter pan  marisha oh my god like /none/ peter pan  matt sure yeah  liam i wasnt looking forward to this moment but that actually sounds like fun  laura thats it thats all you need  matt thats all and i will fulfill my side of the deal  marisha i have a vague idea of why you might want a piece of the threshold crest but why would you  want the high wardens hat  matt because i have my reasons  taliesin so are you going to give us what you stole now we have an arrangement  matt we do have an /none/ arrangement  taliesin its only fair come on  matt reaches into his pocket and pulls out what looks to be a very finely sculpted bronze statue  of syldor that was gifted for essentially his work with emon and establishing better trade routes  between that city and this city its basically a good job salesman of the year award of syldors  marisha they stole his emmy  matt kind of yeah  laura no its like they stole his gold watch  liam i yoink it out of his hand ill take that i got it right /none/ here  sam its a belt buckle  liam right on my belt  travis so weird you pickpocketed the thing that wasnt even expensive  laura why did you take that  sam he cant help it hes a klepto  matt no it was there and nobody was looking  marisha because it ultimately doesnt matter you know how awards work come on  matt regardless we have business to tend to come we have a hat to catch  liam oh you want to come along  marisha oh hang on before we all leave vex and /none/ vax what did your dad do back in the day because  he knows allura and he talked about knowing thordak  laura hes an ambassador to the city  marisha does he have any type of fighting capabilities  laura ugh if he does we never saw it  liam yeah hell bore you to death  laura yeah he can talk a lot  marisha because it sounds like he was a part of the mission to lock in thordak  11 or so years ago  laura what no way  marisha he mentioned that hes been /town/ down this road before  laura he knows allura because he knew the council members  he was the one that sent us off to find  liam hes a traveling salesman that sells politics hes not anything all that fancy  marisha well if he sells politics there could be a lot in selling war against a dragon im not  trying to be a dick but your father was kind of a dick so im just questioning it  laura no hes an asshole thats totally fine  marisha im not trying to talk shit about your family /dung/  laura no feel free  marisha okay  travis yall should totally fight right now just fight in the room while were all here and take  off your clothes  marisha im just saying  travis only way to solve it  laura totally totally  travis yep  taliesin no thats a very dark and disturbing thought im very impressed  marisha thank you ive been learning from you  taliesin thank you now i feel guilty  marisha i dont mean to question to him he just said a few things that raised a few hairs /none/ on the  back of my spine  laura well maybe we can ask him about it  travis you have hair on your spine  marisha about this time i use alter self to go a little halfminxie and get those like when a dog  is pissed off and it puffs up the hair towards grog  matt she shows you this emerging patch of fur that is like shh pushing out the back of her  shoulders  laura thats real sexy  travis pretty sweet  laura pretty hot  taliesin it is a very fair /none/ point although i would say i think it would be best to talk to  allura about your father rather than talk to him again i think hes possibly had enough of us for  a while  travis so we have the meeting we go get the tricorn hat from her like boudoir and then we go get  the crest on the way out right  sam maybe we can even find a clue about where this crest thing is from the meeting  matt grand thats a great idea thats a great idea  laura should we /none/ sleep before the meeting  taliesin i think the meeting is actually tomorrow  laura yes  sam it just says we get one meeting i dont think its been sheduled yet should we go  shedule it  laura lets shedule the meeting  travis or maybe we could send one of the shitty guards to go shedule it for us  laura is he back from getting us food oh no i hope hes not because i want to send a second one  out there  sam ooh because youre a lady  laura because im a /none/ baroness  travis i dont think theyre going to leave us all alone  taliesin i have made such a terrible mistake  laughter  matt you go and check you check the hallway and the guard hasnt returned and the three suddenly  spin around as the door opens  laura hello we require a meeting with the high warden  marisha i do a little gust cantrip from behind the door to make her hair blow in the wind  laughter  matt i need to take this with me to make the meeting schedulable  taliesin yes /none/ of course  laura shedulable  matt shedulable  travis bidet  sam when would we like the meeting tonight or tomorrow  laura and liam tomorrow  matt you guys did wake up about four hours ago  liam did we  sam today later today  taliesin well take the meeting today  sam right after siesta  liam its like northern alaska  matt very well ill return he turns around and leaves and the two guards look at each other  like thank god it wasnt us they both stand at the ready as he goes /tavern/  taliesin let that be a lesson to the two of you about making fun of a foreigners accent im  watching you  matt as the door slowly closes  taliesin schedulable  matt the faun of which is currently garmelie is up on one of the beds right now stretched out  so what are you waiting for  laura thats your bed keyleth  marisha aw man  laura yeah  matt brings up one leg  laura trinket jumps up on the bed and snuggles in with him  matt no dont ugh bear noises  /none/ marisha aw theyre shedding on it  matt creak crash the bottom cracks and the bed actually falls flat on the ground the springs  destroyed  taliesin its all right its a futon now its like college  travis have we seen any of these threshold crests on our way in  liam yeah we walked past some  marisha theyre those little blue stones that are keeping the city here  travis dont say it like its obvious i dont pay attention to shit  laura but we just need a sliver of one  travis right so /none/ like i could take vaxs head and smash it against one and then pick up the  pieces no thats a bad thing from your frown  marisha although grog doesnt have the worst idea and i dont mean smashing vaxs head thats  not what i mean but dont we have some hidden gems because im really terrified if we start  hacking away at these stones what might happen  laura they might not be able to return  marisha so maybe we can do something kind of fakey  sam hes in the room  laughter  /town/ marisha is he asleep hes asleep right  matt no hes currently partially crushed by trinket on the bed and goes like  i can hear you  travis i mean we have jewels and shit just stuff hanging around but what does that do  sam no how do we know if we can chip a piece off without ruining it  laura i wouldnt risk it  liam i think we should talk to some people and ask a couple of questions around town first  laura yeah maybe somebody maybe the high warden knows maybe we can /none/ sneak it out of there or  something  liam just drop it in passing  travis ooh like a souvenir can we have a piece of your threshold crest  laura exactly like that grog exactly like that  travis shit i have got all the good ideas today  laughter  travis im the leader so what do we do until the guard comes back  matt the door opens the guard comes around with food and hands it out to the rest of  laura does anybody have money for a tip because i think youre supposed /none/ to tip them  travis yeah  matt youre not supposed to tip your guards boof slams the door behind  marisha thats an emon tradition were overseas remember  taliesin i like it here  matt all right you finish your meal  laura its delicious  matt and prepare yourselves for an excursion into the city of syngorn to seemingly steal a piece of  the threshold crest and the high warden tyreldas travel hat  marisha i turn into minxie and resign to the idea that im going to be sleeping with garmelie and  trinket and /none/ just cuddle next to them in minxie mode  laura are you coming with us though keyleth  marisha oh were not sleeping  sam no its like one in the afternoon so well probably just go  liam but you know blow a couple more spells  matt so thats one use of your beast form  laura just come on then  marisha ill come on  liam just save it you can stay like that just walk close to me  marisha am i going to freak people out if i walk around like this  taliesin /none/ god i hope so  laura fuck them thats what i say  matt all right you guys make your way outside into the city streets of syngorn to hopefully wait  for the other guard who returns about ten minutes later to tell you it has been sheduled  travis ah very good  matt as soon as you wish attend to the central palace and there you will be greeted  laura okay  travis yep  matt are you leaving now  sam yes  travis well we waste no time  matt makes a big whistle /none/ and the other guards come down and collectively you now have four  guards watching you guys  travis four  laura yeah there were four of them  marisha i drop minxie form because that seems very aggressive  sam as we walk i say to vax oi vax what is the reason for this meeting when we get in there  what do we say to her  marisha can we have your hat  liam i dont think we should lead with that maybe work our way around to it well i would  like advice other /none/ than this little hairy man for how to get to the bog  laura and also what we might face  liam yes  laura and how we can fight what we might face  marisha she might know about fenthras and the bow  laura yes exactly  travis wait scanlan cant you go invisible too what if you two little buggers just went off and  like found it on your own while we were distracting captain fancy hat  sam find fenthras on our own what  travis yeah you go invisible along with fauny tim over /none/ here and you just  go find the fucking hat  sam oh the hat  travis yeah  marisha what if shes wearing the hat what if the hat is on her head  travis we kill everybody  laughter  taliesin to be fair that usually is the plan  matt and thus ended the story of vox machina murdered terribly in the streets of syngorn by  their own people  taliesin clutching a hat  travis tarantino film  matt as you guys make your way towards the palace formulating your plan were going to go /none/  ahead and take a quick bathroom break here guys about ten 15 minutes or so well be back here in  just a little bit so use your restrooms stretch your legs and come back well see you all here in  a few minutes  no audio  cheering  matt thats a lot of people welcome back first off i want to say a big thanks to amanda mclean  for making our awesome graphic for our intermission thank you amanda appreciate that  cheering  matt we are back brought to you by loot crate lets /none/ dive back in as you guys make your way  through the city of syngorn towards the palace to what would be the northern side of the city  eventually you come upon the large slightly swirling stairs that lead to the front of the  large brass and ivory surrounded doorway that leads to the interior you guys have not actually  been inside this palace before youve only seen it from a distance as your father would not let you in too  close to the center of the city as you make your way up the stairs /none/ you can see guards the verdant  guards step out in an aggressive and defensive way but the guards to your sides immediately put  their hands up and signal them to put their arms down and to stand at ease you guys are brought to  the front the doors open and a small elderly elvish gentleman comes out his long white hair  almost touching the ground as he shuffles up he brings a small monocle up to the side of his face  yes do you have business in the palace  liam gday mate  marisha /none/ good day  laura we do we have a meeting with the high warden tyrelda  matt let me see your papers oh i see theyre right here very well follow me please he  turns around and walks his way into the building you all follow suit and are led through the main  entryway to the palace itself on the inside you can see these giant archways that the pillars that  hold them up look like trees that spread to the top like the stone boughs actually hold a canopy  made of marble with beautiful portraits /none/ and long artistic renditions of the creation of syngorn  the people each bloodline that has progressed and taken on the central political structure of the  city as it goes you can see busts of people who have been of historical importance to syngorn and  eventually youre brought to the very end of this hallway amongst a series of other offshoot  hallways and doors there is the next portion of this journey this large central chamber the door  is already partially ajar you are led into what seems to be the equivalent of a throne room /none/ but  it appears that there is a halfcircle table in the center of the room and a series of chairs that  now sit empty across from one side your side the other side of the table you see sitting quietly  and patiently an older elven woman you can see the grey in her hair and the crowsnests at the  corner of her eyes which in elven years means shes quite old shes probably close to 150 or  200 years old by your gathering they can live quite a long time she would be in the /none/ equivalent  of her late 50s  sam not old enough for our party to kill mercilessly  matt no thats a whole different gauge  liam throwback thursday  laura is she wearing a hat  matt she is not wearing a hat  travis shit all right she lives  matt the guard behind ushers you guys forward toward the chairs you all get the idea that you  should sit  sam we sit  matt all right  marisha are there chairs for all of us  matt there are chairs for all of you but /none/ trinket who currently one of the guards is helping to put  his hands out in front to keep back like  laura no  liam thats a good way to lose a finger  laura i wouldnt mess with him if i were you just to be safe and i walk up and i give trinket  a kiss on the nose and i put him in his pokeball  matt the guard leaps back for a second thats much easier  laura just watch closely buddy  matt you step back you all find your seats  laura /none/ just talking to my boobs no big deal  liam buddy buddy  laughter  matt this meeting room pavilion and as you all have your seat you see the high warden waiting  there patiently smile on her face but definitely an expression that shows both intelligence and  guard as you all sit she looks about the group asks so youve all come and made arrangements to  meet with me youve come quite a ways and with very short notice im curious as to what your  reasonings are please state your business  liam you probably /none/ recognize the two of us even if you dont know us were syldors children this  is my sister vexahlia im vaxildan  matt strange it has been some time since youve been within the city welcome  liam thank you  laura were back because were searching for a certain bow fenthras said to be within the murk  something  liam bog of eternal stench i believe  marisha shadowmurk bog thats the one  matt the shademirk  marisha shademirk thats it  liam its not on a lark were not a bunch of flybynights weve already /none/ stopped to see vexs  and my father over the last several months we have been dealing a little more closely than most  would want with the conclave these dragons we know that you are struggling to do the same we  have felled two of them and i dont say that to brag just to impress upon you how serious we are  weve come a long way and we are in need of help thank you darling i think that the citys  intentions are in the best possible place brings me a great deal of personal /none/ satisfaction  actually i would like to offer our aid in service of the very same purpose and that bow in my  sisters hands will go a long way to felling more of these beasts  matt well you stroll in here with a great deal of arrogance and an air of selfimportance not in  a way that is negative more in a way that means you aspire and i hope not reaching beyond your  means if you have indeed felled these two members of the conclave as you say then perhaps this  errand to the /none/ shademirk is not as dangerous as one would expect i would not deny you this and if  you indeed have these capabilities you should have no issue surviving the mirk  you and your companions  laura syldor sent us here because he said you would know what we might face in the shademirk  matt well the shademirk as far as i understand was once a very beautiful landscape  that once was the fountain heart of the gilded run that provided the flowing rivers that spun  throughout this entire region there was an archfey many years /dung/ before who was turned on by his  beloved who had been growing so spiteful so full of angst and anger and vengeful thoughts that it  turned his heart dark and black and he began to spill into the fen around him it was there that  these lands became the shademirk it was there that he became one with the land and corrupted it  and turned it dryads turned foul and shadowed other creatures began to crawl up from the bog  itself and to this day feed off the life of those they can reach the /none/ only thing that holds its  spread at bay is the gilded run the rapids now its found balance and we watched it spread as  those whove lived here for a long time do it does not force any sort of immediate threat to any  of us and it serves its own purpose it has its new i shouldnt say new its been hundreds of  years now but its own life its own biome and we could not be ones to mess with that if you  will but it is dangerous and it is for those /none/ who have scouted far enough to see it say it is  akin to wading through an oil slick it is to walk into a hungry swamp that  never gives up its need to feed  laura sounds lovely  matt yes quite  laura you say youve lived here i know the city goes back and forth between the feywild do you  travel more freely  matt i havent in my older years when i was younger perhaps it is important to maintain an  idea of the current state of the feywild every few decades perhaps /none/ every generation just to be  certain when we have to undergo this transition that we dont come into the middle of a war zone  in its own right but i grow tired in my older years and find myself chained to politics more  often than not  laura how did you make that transition so easily i know that the threshold crests are how the city  gets around  laughter  matt well there are thin areas between the planes there are doorways and we have magical  means to send small scouting parties between this /none/ veil  sam go on  laura well i dont want to be a bother yes but do they entail any part of those threshold  crests im wondering because perhaps we might find ourselves in need of traveling as well  liam we know were strangers but we read much wisdom and experience in your eyes and it would  seem that you have encountered this place yourself or have experience in the past with  those who have and were just looking for an edge really  matt you make a persuasion check  laura oh do i /none/ want to roll this one or do i want to roll  travis oh just pick one  laura okay  matt the everplight of laura bailey  laura ooh thats a good thats a good im glad i switched  travis there are 300 fucking dice on this table  laura 27  liam ooh  matt we have refined the art of creating the threshold crests we have personalized  enchantments that can be utilized for our trained spies our trained guides our trained scouts we  keep them under lock and key but when an endeavor requires /none/ the transference between planes we do on  occasion allow these to go into the hands of our greatest guides  laura if a party would be in search of an item that would be of great use to your survival would  that be worthy  liam listen we know were bastards  laura stop bringing up the bastard part  liam clearly look into my eyes we share the same goal half of my blood is yours i want to  kill the threat to your city and to all cities i ask with complete humility i know /none/ what im  asking please  matt make a persuasion check  laura which one him or me  matt him  laura fuck can i give him advantage can i help him  liam using luck  matt no hes got luck he has his own  laura come on you motherfucker  liam ouch i rolled the same thing low number twice no thats a big five  laura wait no everythings ten i thought everything was a ten  liam no thats right youre right so that is a  laura 12  liam no 13  /none/ sam oh thats better  matt its better  laura why did you talk i think she wouldve listened to me  laughter  matt i appreciate your intent and i understand that our current paths will hopefully align in the  near future however such artifacts are very important to us and the business within syngorn  and i mean no offense in saying that you are no longer residents of our city as such no i  cannot provide you with these crystals however when the time comes and you retrieve this bow which  you say you /none/ seek i hope that we can count each other brethren on the battlefield  travis can i look around the room are there any doors open ajar leading into a bedroom with a  hat on a rack  matt make a perception check grog  sam are there any guards in here with us  matt yeah the guards have led you in theyre just back by the front door you entered  taliesin theres a hat rack and a starbucks thats whats in the room right there its a hat  rack and a starbucks  travis 19 /none/ natural  liam im rusty on my rules that shouldve been a 17  matt whatd you roll  liam i rolled a three but because of reliable talent anything lower counts as a ten ten plus  my persuasion of seven is 17 im just rusty  matt i understand same answer  laughter  liam that is racist  matt no that is a very closely guarded item that wouldve required a roll of 20 or higher to  succeed  liam the whole time i was like that seems wrong to me that its so low  /none/ matt yeah man reliable talents good for that reason  laura why did your luck suck that time  matt its all right grog glancing about the room your suddenly strangely keen giant eyes  in an elvish realm you who can read patterns in rock and mountain faces but when looking at  finely crafted marble its just a big mess you see at the very back of the chamber what appears  to be an imprint into one of the sculptures one of the almost silver and brass latticework that  tends to look like climbing roots and /none/ vines across the back of the room there is a door that is  recessed within that though its hidden in the sculpture itself  now unless you have other business  sam i have a little bit of business  matt yes  taliesin good carry on sorry  sam everyone who meets me knows i am a collector of hats  laughter  sam i take out my beret and i put it on and i say why this one was a very special beret i got  by defending whitestone against an invasion of vampires singlehandedly  /town/ freeing the city from the scourge  matt that sounds entirely believable  sam yes its a fine garment woven by a master craftsman i hear you have a fine hat as well  that youve been seen wearing about town is that true  taliesin i wish i could say this isnt true but its actually true he is genuine  matt i have been known to have a few garments based on where im going yes  sam as a fine appreciator of the haberdasher arts  laughter  sam a connoisseur really could you humor an old /none/ gnome like me and show me i hear tell of a  green hat a tritip hat right  marisha i thought it was blue  sam blue hat  marisha might be green  taliesin hes also colorblind i should mention  sam tritip triangular i just hear its fantastic ive never seen one quite like it up  close i was wondering if i could take a looksee  matt make a deception check  sam with disadvantage  matt yeah because you didnt sleep  marisha yeah you didnt sleep scanlan  sam well that was a /none/ natural 20 but the first one was a six  luckily its plus 14 so 20  laughing and cheering  no audio  matt bards from political requests to a hat collector this is indeed a very strange afternoon  in the palace yes i can have one of my servants show you  sam thank you so much it would mean so much to me ive never met a hat i didnt like  matt then i am certain you will be fulfilled  sam should we just wait here or is it going to be a while /none/  matt no ill have a servant bring you up and she puts her hand up and the guards open the door  and you see a servant walk out who looks to be a younger elven man actually probably about the age  of vax there short tattered hair comes across in front of his eyes  he enters yes mother  could you please show this strange little gnome man to the hat room  yes of course yes follow me  sam theres a hat room i have a hat room in my place too  matt /none/ thats splendid now is there any other business  taliesin just to be clear you would say that the river is probably our safest mode of entry into  the bog  matt it surrounds the bog and runs past the southern portion of it so youll most likely come  upon the river one way or another lest you wish to traverse the green sea but that i would not  recommend either  marisha so theres no real easy way into the bog is what youre saying  matt theres no easy way to anything in the feywild /none/ my child  marisha got it  laura have you seen the tree yourself  matt i have not  taliesin are there river men who run boats on the river  matt no the river tends to run itself  laughter  taliesin i had that coming thats fair  travis thats good  matt do you wish to inquire about my shoes my coat perhaps  marisha oh my god theyre so cute though theyre amazing shoes i didnt notice them until  you pointed them out sorry no continue on  matt is that all  taliesin /none/ i think thats all yes  matt all right good luck i wish you safe  marisha oh wait wait lady  sam high warden high warden  marisha high warden im sorry i was just curious its my first time to syngorn and its  in the feywild its special right is there a gift shop a visiting the temple and sights of  syngorn type of shop  sam i went to syngorn and all i got was this lousy shirt  marisha right  laura we have to make that shirt  liam shirt after this one /none/  matt ill see what braum can do braum please escort them to some semblance of a gift shop  marisha oh thank you  taliesin good luck  matt now i have important business to tend to good luck safe travels dont die let us see  each other on the battlefield soon to slay a dragon now please be on your way  laura we appreciate your time  matt you guys get up and leave trinket goes  laura trinkets in my necklace  matt thats right trinket is in your necklace so trinket does nothing  /none/ laura trinket does nothing but stare outside of the necklace  matt you make your way out of the room the guards following suit you can see the lightish  brownish reddish tousled hair of the elven boy whos waiting hes wearing very fine clothing  though very baggy on his scrawny frame as you all step out he says all right so im to take you  to the hat room i believe oh youre going to be very happy its quite the room  sam the room i could care less about its those hats  matt well /none/ i think youll still be pleased are you all coming  noises of agreement  liam traveling with scanlan weve all become amateur hat enthusiasts  laura i pull out my hat and i put it on  travis yep i pull out the rhinoceros horn  liam gong  laughter  matt and he pulls out a little masquerade mask and goes like oh my goodness  sam youre a hatter too  marisha do you get the monthly newsletter  matt well i used to until we came to the feywild its very boring these days well come /none/  please and he darts off excitedly down the hallway the guards groan loudly behind you you  make your way through the second hallway on the left of the palace down a flight of stairs into a  storage room to the left you can see what looks to be the entrance to some sort of a heavily  barred metallic doorway about ten feet wide about 12 feet tall further down you come to two  doorways he pulls out a keyring goes no not that one ah here we are it opens up into a  small /none/ room you can see in here its a display room in here you can see ornamental armor and  helmets and all sorts of classic syngorean designs which change often because well elves  when they dont have a lot of things to fill their time with its all about designing new outfits  and new armor theres a whole display of very classic designs for the guards for the watchers  for the people who first founded syngorn its like a history walk through but there is a  section that is primarily helmet designs for different stations and /none/ this is as close to a hat  room as we have this here is part of the original temple of ioun design it is a delightful piece  he keeps going on and on  laura do we see the hat that were looking for in here  matt you do see there is a small rack to the side which is for more just things that are used and  you can see there are like widebrim rainyday carriagedriving hats you can see there are  farbrimmed cloak hoods that are used for horseriding beneath the rain you /none/ can see there  are a few more curved up to one side archerbased hats and you can see there a nice green velvet  hat that is resting across  liam is that the one area with hats  laura are they all just jumbled in together  matt theyre all jumbled in together in that corner and then the actual helmets are against the  wall in different setups  liam go ahead  laura i nudge vax and i point it out  liam scanlan look at all those codpieces across the room  laura are the /none/ guards in here with us  matt they are yes  laura i pratfuckingfall i pratfall right in front of the guards on  the opposite side of the room  matt which one  laura i walk to the other side of the room and i just fall over  liam eat shit knock shit over  matt make a perform check  laura oh shit can it be acrobatics though  matt no acrobatics is avoiding the fall  laura shit okay 19  matt 19  laura i want to take some shit down with me  /none/ matt and you do delightfully so you fall over trip go into a tumble grab arm over pieces of  metallic armor crashing sound  laura ah oh god did you see that  marisha oh my god vex are you okay  laura i think there was a marble on the ground  marisha oh no what keyleth turns to the guard  laughter  marisha that was lady vexahlia the baroness of whitestone i could sue you i could sue you for  negligence  matt make a sleightofhand check  sam hold on hes making a check /none/  liam 24  matt all right you take the hat you place it away everyone seems to be focused on the  currently yelling vexahlia  laura ow i think i hurt my wrist  marisha you will get a letter from me good sir you will get a letter okay  matt this was look i apologize if your friend is clumsy but this wasnt part of our job  description okay its been a very  marisha your fivestar review just went to a four okay i just want to say  matt braum pushes his way /none/ in and goes like i am so terribly sorry i didnt mean i hope this  hasnt ruined your opinion of the hat room  laura if we could just see a gift shop i would be thrilled  travis and i say to the side i go coughs pinch my knee is that the one  marisha what  matt are you feeling all right sir  travis yeah no coughs pinch my knee if thats the one no to the little to the little satyr  taliesin lets just find a gift shop lady tyrell doesnt need to /none/ hear anything about this lets  just move on  matt lady who  marisha and sam high warden tyrelda  taliesin tyrelda  sam yes well theres another lady named lady tyrell whos  taliesin no this is amazing what my handwriting does  liam what did you put in that tea percival  matt well im glad to see this hasnt ruined your opinion of the collections here  liam just the safety codes really  marisha if you took us to the gift shop it might fix things okay  matt then come come you two clean /none/ this up and the two guards go what  yes my lord and the two guards eye you very intensely as they walk over and start picking up  all the pieces of armor  laura ow  marisha i start pretending like im doing a cure wounds spell to her wrist you know  matt all right as you guys make your way out with two of the guards now two of them are now  left behind  taliesin as we walk out i just make sure the two guards are i hope this didnt interrupt your  /none/ schedules for today  sam shedule  taliesin yes schedule  matt somehow their chin goes higher its impressive really you make your way through  down another set of hallways back towards the beginning of the palace he goes its not really  a gift shop the closest thing that we could ascertain based on your request is we do have a  small collection of gifts and knickknacks weve received from allies over time that really arent  much use to us  marisha wait youre taking us to the lost and found please this is the high /dung/ baroness lady  vexahlia  matt perhaps youll find something you like  laura no lost and found is a wonderful place to go  matt its a combination lost and found and just gifts from political allies that didnt  understand the high wardens aesthetic yes no please this way please and he leads you back to  the main hallway you guys walked through a little ways towards the entrance and then another  hallway to the left he unlocks and this is straightup like a dark storage room it is just  boxes and boxes that are /none/ sealed and he lights a small lantern on the side it flickers to life  and the flame itself as opposed to a low oil lantern flicker is like a bright glowing light  you can see this is a magically set lantern as most of the lights in the city are just everlit  torches or things that flicker on and off as a light spell it illuminates the room around you  and you can see no ones walked in here in a while  liam these are for sale  matt no these are for the taking /none/ should you wish  laura awesome  sam well what do we see  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  marisha can i ask a logistical question  matt sure  marisha is garmelie with us or did we leave him behind  matt you dont know

scanlan comes up next to her and is equally distracted by this wonderful magical light like  two moths to a flame percival  taliesin nine  matt nine all right the two twins you guys spend some time looking through the nearby  riffraff and braum is in the back hoping you find something to satiate your need for gifts the  twins find /none/ their way through a few boxes and you open up and theres small porcelain dolls dressed  up in ancient emons outfits and designs you can see what looks to be very dusty kraghammer  designed weaponry you can see what looks to be a bunch of small game pieces that half of them have  been lost like a chessboard of some kind but only part of its there this is really the junk  room this is where all the really bad christmas presents get put every year  no thanks its great  sam is it like /none/ storage wars where there might be something  matt it could it could be depending on how well you search  sam well i searched terribly  matt you did  marisha

untrained though natural arcane instincts reveal to you that  laura i can speak with animals  matt yes you can and there are no animals here nothing even remotely magical seems to cross your  attention /none/ span unfortunately and you guys spend a good hour in here sifting through  liam as as were digging in the corner i say i thought maybe coming back here i might like this  city a little bit better and i was fucking wrong  laura this place fucking sucks  sam lets get out of here  travis yeah theres nothing in here  sam no lets leave  marisha okay yeah sure yeah  travis lets go

a whitestone crest from the threshold of the door  taliesin we break it  marisha theres a piece of your threshold crest  laughing and cheering  taliesin dont cast friends on people its not nice  matt you watch as his ears his pointed ears slowly slink back and his hair stands up all  across the back of his head his beard almost bristles out into spines as the hat goes poink  and pops off and hits the /none/ ground he snatches it up grabs the piece  taliesin thats your threshold crest piece of a threshold crest  matt thank you  laura yay  matt well it appears that our deal has been kept  laughing and cheering  matt he snaps his fingers and you feel like this sudden this almost unnoticeable pressure at the  base of your neck that you had felt since you made the deal release and absolve on both of you all  right so well at least i got the hat out of it so the shademirk then come follow /none/ me grab  your things laughs  marisha lets go  taliesin i cannot wait  matt now he vanishes and grog you feel a little tug on your finger to pull you forward  travis i fart  laughter  matt i had that coming we now have even more of a reason to make haste this is a very small room  and ive been following behind him for quite some time lets go now quickly and you see grog  being pulled forward by the finger and you guys get the feeling that hes leading you out /none/ of the  city invisible by grogs finger  travis were going this way follow me chaps  marisha follow the finger  sam are the guards following  matt the two guards are following yes  laura woo that was really fun  marisha my hair is messed up  sam good sesh  laura good that was really  liam thanks grog  laughter  liam i feel loose as a goose lets go see this bog  marisha and i transform into a goose and come

impression on this city coming back  travis im going to kill you later  matt you guys are led back through the main portion of syngorn towards the front gates where  the watchers reside the doors are opened for you and you are escorted out the front gate where the  guards very happily leave you to be and both turn around at each other and go heavy sigh /none/ and they  walk back inside the confines of the outer syngorean wall you guys are now back out in the  wilds of syngorn the finger tugs lead you out past the front of the city through the marshlike  mandrake fields that you initially traversed when you made your way to syngorn and then find your  way back into the evershifting grasses heading duskward towards where  it seems the dusk sun will set  laura duskward  taliesin duskward  marisha always duskward  sam i hate that direction  matt theres also nightward seaward or /none/ tangleward which would you prefer  sam are those different directions  matt yes those are different directions  laura tangleward did you say tangleward  matt tangleward it was mentioned before yeah  laura oh i just thought of the disney movie and i think i spaced out there  matt im pretty sure that the people in the feywild havent seen that not yet theyre  waiting for it to come out on bluray all right so you make your way towards where the grasses get  heavy again and you see garmelie foosh once again take visible /none/ form again and be like ah sorry  that concentration for a while really gets to you im so glad to be out of that stuffy place so  shall we rights his hat and even in righting it its a little crooked to one side and he  begins marching duskward  laura onward to the theater  matt no no theater we are avoiding the theater no  travis garmelie how far of a journey is it to this bog  matt say about four times since we met  laura okay  travis that doesnt mean anything /none/ to me  laura four times since we met  liam im just curious why are you so worried about the theater i love the theater  matt i have my reasons and he continues walking forward  liam thanks great good talk  laura its been 14 hours since weve met  sam can we travel any faster than that can we mist can we tree can we  laura wait a minute you could if you know a tree is that would be pretty stupid to just pop  out of the cancerous tree but if we know /none/ a tree is there couldnt you potentially  just fucking do it  liam youve had a lot of good ideas thats not one of them thats a bad idea  marisha shes not wrong  laura wait keyleth what if you just open up the cancerous tree we reach through we grab the  fucking bow and then were out  marisha well youre not entirely wrong i dont know if i can teleport via plants because  generally that takes knowing the plant however i do have tree stride which means we can nope  never mind i /none/ can only do that on myself  matt wahwah  taliesin we are not sending keyleth the goose into a bog to retrieve a bow from an angry  cancerous tree  marisha but im loosey im a loosey goose  matt that would look amazing on an epitaph im just saying  marisha we can mist there  sam would that save time i dont remember how fast we go  marisha i might have to take a hot nap  travis a hot nap  marisha yeah  matt didnt you guys just take a hot nap  /none/ laughter  marisha yeah the answer is yes i can do all those things  taliesin well lets travel for a bit and then well take a proper break  marisha if we can get to the edge of the bog then well take a sleep  laura wait i think the edge of the bog is kind of far though  taliesin well start our journey and the next leg of our journey  travis yeah lets get going  marisha well go until were tired  matt i like the sound of that  laura oh belches  /none/ laughing and cheering  matt most impressive for a lady  laura thank you thats a baroness burp  marisha robert durst shit  matt as you guys push on further northward at the behest of garmelie you push for another two hours  or so through the evershifting grasses and as you get further and further north the color of  the grass seems to go from that deep verdant green to almost a maroon purplish color  laura i pop trinket out of the necklace  matt he attacks some of the grass and chews it up  /none/ laura yeah get it  marisha dont touch the grass itll get angry at you itll yell at you for a week  travis i dont think that applies here  laura its okay darling its okay keyleth  marisha what  laura do not yell at my bear  marisha i was just trying to protect him  liam i give him some grass  marisha dont  sam its fine  taliesin its fine  matt and just keeps going forward through the grass fields  marisha does the grass seem angry  matt no it just seems /none/ to be changing color  marisha suck it grass  matt as you say that the grass goes from a purplish color to a deep deep red around you  sam oh god  marisha because you suck out the joy of all of us living around you and youre so amazing  travis that makes it even worse  sam not a compliment  travis youre still going in the same direction  marisha i mean you suck out bad  liam i grab keyleths hand lets take a walk  matt all of you as youre walking the /none/ actual grasses around you are getting more and more dense  and are catching on your feet and youre finding that your progression  is getting slower and slower  laura wait no i have landstride which means i dont slow against any land  matt yeah so youre fine you just coast ahead the rest of the party its like theyre going  through waisthigh thickets the grass looks gentle but as soon as it hits your body it rakes  across it almost like very fine serrated plants and its catching on your clothing and pulling you  /none/ back its almost like since those statements were made  laughter  travis i have a hooded lantern i could set this whole fucking thing ablaze  all no  matt the red goes to a deep cinderlike red  sam are we going to have roll initiative on grass  laura no wait  taliesin does no one im going to take a moment  marisha i feel like the grass feels our emotions  sam your emotions because you yelled at it  taliesin lovely field i apologize for the rudeness of my compatriots we will be gentle /none/  trouncing through you we will make as little mark as we can and enjoy the splendor of your  everchanging colors you are majestic you are windswept im flirting with grass you are  everything i could hope for in a beautiful view  sam i sing a song  matt what do you sing  cheering  sam singing keep growing keep flowing knowing you can always count on me  travis laura and sam singing for sure  sam singing thats what scanlans for  cheering  matt percy i want you to make a persuasion check /none/ against the grass  adding the d10 inspiration die  taliesin oh d10 inspiration come on  marisha i do an interpretive dance  sam come on persuade that plant  taliesin that was leaning  sam that was a leaner  taliesin that jumped but thats still fine okay its persuasion check oh yeah thats not  bad 24  matt what was it  taliesin eight plus six plus seven counting 21  sam its more than that  matt between the interpretive dance of keyleth amongst the tattered angry grasses the beautiful  vocal stylings of scanlan /none/ shorthalt and percy speaking out a wondrous poem towards the  evershifting grasses you watch as the deep bright red subsides into the relaxed purple and  eventually goes back to a dull green and you find your traveling no longer impeded as it once was  laura yeah  matt good job  laura good job  matt you successfully parlayed with a field  travis first doors then grass  liam dont talk shit to grass  sam how do you want to mow this  laughter  matt so about another half an hour of travel before /dung/ in the distance ahead of you can see the  dark edge of what looks to be another forest ahead of you wide and almost endtoend you see it a  lot of these wooded areas almost meet the horizon its like youre stepping into just an endless  wall of trees as you begin to approach closer to the edge garmelie looks up and says all right  so we have choices now we have the moonbrush before us or we have the green sea which is far  seaward of here i would recommend the moonbrush  sam /none/ then we should go the other way because we dont trust a fucking thing you say  matt very well  laura wait  taliesin no the high warden did say  marisha  to avoid the green sea  laura why do you recommend the moonbrush  matt because its the only real route to get to the gilded run  laura what is the gilded run  matt the gilded run are the rivers that surround it  laura right those  matt yes youre looking for the shademirk you have to get through the gilded run to /none/ get the  shademirk you have to go through the moonbrush to get to the gilded run  liam wheres the theater  matt no theater  travis right so were going through the brushy moon  matt yes come come  laura yeah are you okay with that scanlan  sam ill allow it  marisha how long have we been awake  matt you are youve been awake for about 12 hours now id say  marisha if we want to mist there then we have to sleep but well press on for a few more hours  /none/ matt certainly about another 40 minutes of foot travel before you begin to hit the edge of the  moonbrush forest as you approach garmelie says all right so things you should know about the  moonbrush one it is home to a number of denizens and as you look overhead you can see  its a thick fog that permeates the entirety of this forest you can see the outline of every tree  trunk towards the outer rim of this entire brush the canopy of the trees themselves are like long  weeping willows that sag and give /none/ this very ominous feeling to the entire forest you can see  small mountain spires breaking through portions of the tree line in the distance occasionally miles  between each other sometimes a cluster far closer together he says there is a clan of sorts that  lives amongst the forest well try our best to avoid they are natural hunters and they are of  the lycan persuasion  sam and taliesin oh  matt so best that we avoid interaction they are wellread they have a society we should  touch none of it  marisha question you /none/ mentioned we are going into the moonbrush with lycan hunters  matt yes its a necessity  marisha yeah no it sounds like it yeah  matt yes but they do have natural enemies there is a faction of pixies that live within  known as the wishers and they are forever locked in a struggle so avoid both do not get involved  at all and well be fine  laura do the lycan tend to populate trees or if we stay up high can we maybe avoid them  matt actually they travel mostly in the trees thats /none/ the easiest way for them  to hunt is unseen  laura well there you go  matt they are ruled by a singular lycan lord who goes by the name of ukurat  marisha what  sam ulurat  matt ukurat  marisha ukurat  laura ukurat or udurat  matt ukurat  laura and liam ukurat  matt ukurat  travis bob  matt he is to also be avoided  taliesin is that an elven name is that an elven word  matt it was once  laura wait he used to be elven he used to /none/ be elven  matt they all used to be many things he happened to be elven at one time yes so anyway  well avoid them and avoid the wishers and also those things  the little plants that you saw before  laura mandrakes  matt mandrakes also everywhere avoid them  laura okay  matt and well just avoid the other things i mentioned so shall we and he begins to step  and march up to the edge of the moonbrush  taliesin okay  sam its fine weve killed dragons well be fine  travis im /dung/ so stoked right now  marisha did we okay yeah sure yeah  matt all right you guys make your way into the dark moonbrush itself and as you walk into the  forest immediately you can hear the swell of distant crickets thousands upon thousands  sourceless fill the air around you  sam audience please  cricket noises laughter  matt that works i was going to look for cricket sounds here thats also totally doable  marisha someones got a really good one  matt as you walk in the actual dusk light that has permeated the /none/ feywild begins to give way to  the first signs of night you can look up through the different breaks in the tree line you can see  stars for the first time and you can see what looks to be a very dull white glow of moonlight  hitting some of the trees and breaking through some of the treetops themselves the underbrush  itself is very soft and spongy with a lot of leaves that have fallen and given this soft setup  as you guys push forward for another halfhour or so you in particular vexahlia come /town/ upon what  looks to be a series of stones what looks to be a series of small structures almost not like  buildings per se but intently placed obelisks of raw rough stone and as you come across and look  on that side you can see what looks to be the base of one of the mountain spires that sticks  out a large cave  laura do i see any kind of markings on the obelisks  matt make a perception check  laura oh get out of here  matt whatd you get  laura natural /dung/ one  matt natural one  laura i know  matt they just look rough and old theyve been placed there its old magic  liam god youre so bad at dd  laura i suck  matt but you do see around the ground right out in front of this cave what appears to be hundreds  and hundreds of small objects piles what looks like fruits and flowers and bones and stone  carvings all sorts of things placed in front of this cave  marisha can i do a nature check on one of the bones to /none/ see if i can identify  where it came from  matt okay so you head out and take one of the bones and look at it  go ahead and make a nature check  marisha yeah the closest bone i dont want to ooh yeah  taliesin that aint nothing to sneeze at  marisha no its not 28  matt 28 this bone belongs to a larger bird like a great eagle you cant quite specifically make out  what it is but its been carved with small letters into it of a language you cant  /dung/ understand it looks like its some sort of a ritual item thats been placed there in the  ground but as you pick up and make this moment noticed  liam im going stealth just because  matt you all hear a giant echoing roar coming from the cave  liam was i fast enough  matt roars whatd you roll  liam 30  matt 30 okay yeah you just bip out you are gone the rest of you are right at the outside of  this small clearing where all of these small objects have been placed you /none/ hear this rumbling  loud roar come tearing through  marisha i step back with the bone  matt okay what are the rest of you guys doing  laura i pull the broom out from behind my back  matt okay  marisha can i lean the bone over to vexahlia and be like is this draconic  laura is it draconic  matt it is not draconic  marisha god fucking damn it  laura is it anything that i recognize though  matt what languages do you know  laura elvish abyssal undercommon  matt no none /none/ of those  laura shit  matt however at this time the trees behind you two because the rest of you guys  were staying back  laura whos you two  matt vex and keyleth the trees fwoosh shift and close off the exterior as you turn towards  the entrance of the cavern you can see emerging from the front a giant its hard to really tell  the first moment that it appears but you see what looks to be a gargantuan dire bearlike entity  made of crackling blue ghostly energy shimmering translucent not actually a /none/ physical form but  massive in size stomping noises roar  marisha wait did we get cut off did vex and i get cut off from everybody else  matt yep from everybody else  laura shit i grab keyleths wrist and i fly into the air  marisha i hold on for dear fucking life  matt as you grab her wrist as you fly up the trees swoosh close off and you go slamming into  the tree boughs crashing sound you lose the broom for a second go ahead and hold your grip  go ahead and /none/ make a strength check  laura a strength check  sam we cant even see them matt  matt you guys cant see them and they just closed off in the trees  laura come on is that a saving throw or just a check  matt just a check  laura five  matt five you lose your grip on the broom and both vex and keyleth tumble down about 20 feet  you both suffer seven points of damage as you slam into the center of another pile of what looks like  knickknacks and things that are /dung/ gathered on the floor its at this point that your mind hits that  these are probably offerings these are things that are left as some sort of offering to this  bearlike spirit entity that exists in this cave the bear which is now stomping sounds coming  up towards you on the ground looks to keyleth roars  marisha hi  laura i cast speak with animals  matt okay you cast speak with animals  laura yeah  marisha like i taught you  laura weak growling sounds  laughter  laura and i say we mean /none/ you no harm great ghost bear in fact we brought you an offering and we  just accidentally touched the other offering of yours  liam où est la bibliothèque  laughter  laura the cheese is old and moldy  matt none of the bears face moves at all but an echoing voice in common not animal speak comes  blasting into both of your minds and those of you guys outside of the trees trying to find a way  through also hear this echo you have entered the domain of orlan you destroy and disgrace that  /none/ which was gifted what do you offer in response to your travesty  laura yeah well i  sam we have a hat a really good hat  marisha ive got an old tobacco box i got from lost and found  laura ooh yeah thats pretty good i offer him a tea set  matt as you pull the tea set out the bear claw reaches out and smashes it out of your hand and  goes scattered and breaking across one of the stones and goes you walk into the realm of the  wild unwatched unrespecting the /dung/ beasts of this land hold no kinship with you you will prove  offering yourself and the tongue licks the lips  marisha what i turn into a giant scorpion  matt the scorpion takes its form as it does the bear growls  marisha you want an offering you can have mine  matt make a persuasion check on that  marisha oh god  liam by the way am i hidden in or outside  matt youre outside  marisha 21  laura good job keyleth  marisha thank you  matt i sense you have kinship with /none/ beasts you may pass though i will not forgive this  infraction you  laura yeah  matt you shall be the prize  laura oh fuck  matt the giant bear is looming over you now and its size is so immense probably 15 or 20 feet to the  top of its shoulders  laura trinket i call trinket  matt you call trinket  laura i call trinket  matt leaps out of your necklace and lands right beside you and just roars roars up to the  spirit the spirit pulls back roars roars back and /none/ trinket is so tiny by comparison and is  up to the elbow but trinket lashes out at the giant bear just leaps up towards it pushes into  it and starts tearing at its throat the giant bear takes trinket with one claw and slams him  into the ground trinket rolls and gets back up growls you can see a little bit of blood at the  corner of its mouth and just lunges again this time jumping up onto the bears back and clawing  up onto its onto the top of its torso the bear growls /none/  laura hes pretty cool  matt the bear head looks up at trinket now gnawing onto its hide gnawing sounds seemingly  to no real effect and the bear reaches up and grabs trinket and plucks him off the side and sets  him down next to you the bear now begins to speak in the language of bears which only you can  understand at this moment says you walk with this one is she your charge and trinket voices  back you hear the bear noises up to the bear as you hear coming out she is /dung/ everything her  life is mine you take her you take me or we walk on and remember you as a kind soul  the giant bear looks down very well if you are at her side i take your charge as well and the  spirit bear steps forward passing through you and passing through trinkets form and what feels  like this rush of warm air and then disperses into a series of sparkles you watch the energy  slowly drift down and fade into the ground around you and everything gets quiet the trees slowly  creak /dung/ back and open the perimeter of this forest around you leaving you alone and trinket comes  up and licks your face  laura oh  cheering  matt as hes looking at you you look down and you can see the necklace that you hold is actually  shimmering with a blue light that passed through you and it slowly fades to its dark normal form  sam youre part bear now  matt so thats your new item card for ravens slumber  cheering  audience member whats it do  laura i dont know  matt so /none/ ive got to finish this quickly because weve got to get to the q and a but as of this  point in time and ill give you an ability card but trinket now benefits from your hunters mark  cheering  matt and has an ability called primal fury you can use once per short rest that ill get to next  episode as you all gather around this moment of silence this quiet tension that has now  dispersed you see trinket lift up vex from the base of her cloak and put her back on her feet /none/  nuzzles the side of her and you can see the trees overhead open up a little wider than they were  before leaving some moonlight to hit the two of them and thats where well go ahead and leave  this
