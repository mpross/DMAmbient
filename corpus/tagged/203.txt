none	 being said guys lets go ahead and bring this down into tonights  episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt and welcome back everybody last we left off vox machina had been finding their way  through the realms to talk with various deities in hopes of getting information and perhaps a  blessing or two to aid them in their coming battle against vecna the intenttoascend entity  the longmissing and recently returned archlich that plagued the end of the age of arcanum you  have since discovered the location of his rebirth followed into the shadowfell 
none	 through the city of  thar amphala took down his tower of entropis did battle and nearly fell you escaped in time and  in this recovery period have been seeking out information on how to stop him before this  ascension occurs and by what tools necessary  youve traveled to the blessed fields of elysium where you met pikes deity the everlight  sarenrae where she received her blessing you made your way to the fortress of the sun where  you met with the dawnfather pelor took his challenge and received his blessing you were  then 
none	 given information about the whereabouts of ioun the knowing goddess and the domain of  knowledge who had been hidden away since her wounding during the calamity the key to her realm  was apparently hidden within not an object but an individual given loose information about the  whereabouts of this individual you tracked down a small home in the forested regions outside the  pools of wittebak in the cliffkeep mountains  there you spoke with this individual this sprigg the obnoxious and then were immediately assailed  by a number of assassins sent by the whispered one 
none	 vecna apparently keeping watch on your  current location and able to send such groups of assassins with vast haste you did battle managed  to save the life of sprigg the obnoxious and through conversation unveiled that he was indeed  a key to this realm  keyleth by entwining your hands with the rest of the party and focusing on this strange magical  essence hidden within spriggs form you completed your plane shift spell you found yourself  suddenly within a dimension of an endless library shelves of winding books and tomes that spiral  beyond sight 
none	 in the midst of this amazing atmosphere a voice called you to a central  portion of the chamber there it seems youve come across the knowing mistress ioun herself  there awaiting your arrival  laura did we see her  matt you did  laura okay is she old or young i cant remember  matt im going to go over this going to get you in a space something to bring us back into the  moment  so you glance around your vision darting from shelf to stack the darklit areas empty of  anything but 
none	 empty vessels carrying books until you see it the shelves have stopped ahead to  reveal a circular common area within the library where the ground domes downward an 80foot  concave pit of cushions and tables all standing at odd angles without sliding holding tea cups and  writing implements against gravity as you know it long spiralling streams of silver blue and grey  silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight the material resting in gentle  piles amongst the cushions sorry microphone against the cushions sitting within the center of  the dome 
none	 no larger than a normal person is an older woman of long wavy silver hair her olive  skin is somewhat weathered with wrinkles but the warmth of her smile and her vibrant purple eyes  put you at ease her blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that  snake through the pillows like roots of a giant tree this is the mistress and she beckons you  forward  sam we step forward are we on the edge of the bowl is she in the bowl and were on the edge of 
none	  the bowl  matt yeah you guys are on the edge of it shes in the very center of it  sam are we going to go into the bowl  laura are we allowed  matt nothing seems to be holding you back  darin o ioun o goddess of knowledge o lord who knows all you know but i dont let me ask you a  question and youll see i didnt phrase that as a question because i know how gods work and that  probably would have been my question and then i might as 
none	 well have just talked to a turnip which  ive done found it pleasant that being said this is my question the next thing out of my  mouth is going to be my question why did you choose me to be your key im nothing im a  coward why would you ever choose me  matt she opens her arms as you stand at the edge of this domed precipice and you watch as the  tendrils unfurl pulling back a bit revealing small pathways to walk down toward her her arms  open in a welcoming motion 
none	  laura ill walk forward  taliesin im walking in there  sam take a tumble  matt the purpose in choosing you sprigg was as with all the other keys ive chosen before you  an unlikely choice you were at odds with many of my outlooks but i saw within you still the seed  of the seeker of knowledge so in that balance i found a proper vessel someone who at once would  not be the choice that i would make to hide my key but a person not beyond the realm of  redemption within 
none	 the domain that i look over  darin thank you  matt now come please sit youve come a long way im curious as to what your reasons are for  coming to me at this hour and i wish to see if my assumptions are correct sit  laura you dont know already  darin well the goddess of knowledge is implied in the title not insulting anyone knock knock  matt whos there  darin you would know  matt you watch as her stoic expression curls into a smile and her head falls back a bit to 
none	 a small  chuckle chuckles humor is perhaps a bit thin in these walls as of late its nice to have a  laugh thank you  liam who was it though  darin it was me the whole time  matt it was larkin my friend  laura oh shit  liam she knows everything  travis larkin  darin i dont know who that is  travis many dont  darin well said  sam o mighty ioun we are here to ask you for help for a great danger you might already know  this but a 
none	 great danger has befallen the world there is one who has come from another plane to  become a god himself vecna for all we know he may already have achieved godhood but hes well  on his path  matt i know much about this individual you speak and i had assumed this was the reason for your arrival  laura do you know if hes been successful  matt i do not ive not sensed any change in the cosmetology of the world cosmology even  cosmetology  travis i thought that was hair and makeup  matt 
none	 thats a different word her domains expand beyond just knowledge guys hence the unfurling  travis ive been thinking about getting some highlights for this beard  liam its frenchie  laughter  travis singing beauty school dropout  matt but no you see this vecna is in direct opposition to what i represent and i believe has  taken some precautions to keep from my distant sight so while i have assumptions and what  information makes its way to me there is a bit of relying on you to fill in the gaps  taliesin what do you 
none	 wish to know  matt well do you intend to return to face this entity or have you chosen or found champions in  exandria who would rise up against this individual  laura we didnt even realize that was an option  taliesin hadnt occurred to us  marisha wow maybe thats very selfcentered of us now that i think about it  laura we intend to face him down ourselves  travis we want to fight  marisha were heading his direction no matter what  matt do you think you have the strength required to do this 
none	  sam were gathering the strength right now some among us have already the one whos making weird  faces has already sworn allegiance to another god  travis hashtag blessed  matt her eyes close for a minute and she nods the coming fight does indeed warrant the aid that  these journeys would muster and i can see the touch of my brethren on you already and she  motions towards vax and vex and pike  taliesin even with these gods there is still much doubt as to our success we are not certain  we are 
none	 not sure  travis we fought once and if this is a broom motion we were just getting swooped swept what  is it swiffered  laura pelor mentioned something about the prime trammels  matt i was wondering if that would surface well if you are indeed here seeking my gift know  that i do not grant it lightly for those who are not already claimed she glances around the rest  of the group grog strongjaw just being within my realm is of nearpainful discomfort to you for  that i apologize and can see you are 
none	 not to be my vessel  laura its okay grog  travis oh what a roller coaster i was going up and then going back down thank you for your gaze  my lady  liam grog just invented amusement park rides  matt keyleth of zephrah you have been carved from empathy and acceptance while you do indeed  pursue understanding my gifts find little purchase on your path of responsibility  percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  sam whispering she knows everything  matt you have always been a student of knowledge and a seeker 
none	 of truths i am fond of your hunger  for understanding but you do keep your secrets and are selfish with your discoveries still you  have much growing to do  scanlan shorthalt you are a buffoon at least that is the facade you craft and display to the  world while you weave tales of the experiences around you and share your stories with any whod  listen you wrestle the mysteries of exandria from their hidden places and shout them to any who  would listen and inspire the lost to find purpose you hold the blade 
tavern	 of the white duke and walk a  parallel path you are a storyteller and i am the keeper of all stories i shall task you with my  challenge  sam not to question your infinite knowledge and judgment but my stories are more of little bar  room tales and silly poems to pass the time i would hardly call them epic histories of  civilization  matt for now perhaps  darin were all stories in the end just make sure yours is a good one  matt do you think that your compatriots would have the 
none	 strength now to rise against such a  scourge had you not been there to lift their spirits with these tales  laura its true scanlan  sam im really powerful  laura you are  liam and humble  sam its my best asset  liam and deeper than you let on  travis and the cube  laura laughing and a cube  matt she glances over at you with a knowing look  sam if you have faith in me i will have faith in you and trust you and your knowledge and i will  try 
none	 to complete any task you ask of me  matt then let the challenge be placed before you scanlan shorthalt somewhere within this  library lies the book that contains the incantation of isolation the arcane rite that  banished the chained oblivion you have one hour to retrieve it your friends can help you but you  can only present one tome to me and should it be incorrect then i shall await another warrior of  keen mind to find me and accept my gift for i can only guide one strong enough to face the foe  
none	 before you return to me when you are certain youve found it your challenge begins now and  with that her entire body vanishes in a gust of wind all the little tendrils of paper flutter out  and come to rest within the dome and you look up and see the immensity of this library  travis incantation of isolation  laura incantation of isolation  marisha i speak primordial  travis we dont know the name of the book right so we cant locate object  sam theres a tome that contains the incantation of what  travis 
none	 laura marisha and sam isolation  marisha which was what they used  laura what is with this pencil it was dipped in ketchup or something  matt dont use that pencil use one of your own  laura but it needs to be sharpened  matt just push really hard  travis how do we do that sprigg  darin yes  travis do you have a tome at your place that has the incantation of isolation  darin not anymore burnyburny ashyashy byebye  laura do you remember the name of it  darin no  laura im 
none	 going to try casting locate object and cast it on the tome that contains the incantation  of isolation try it why not  travis can it work like that  laura i dont know  liam an object known to you as long as you have seen it up close within 30 feet at least once  laura oh really  liam yeah its a spell i have now  matt describe or name an object that is familiar to you you sense the direction of the objects  location so as long as the object is within a 
none	 thousand feet of you  laura okay  matt so you cast the spell and you think about it and you concentrate nothing  laura im going to kneel down and pray to the dawnfather since he was one of the ones that  helped fight the chained oblivion to see if he could guide us at all  matt okay you close your eyes and focus and you begin to beseech the knowledge and wisdom of the  dawnfather two minutes pass with no answer  liam during that two minutes im going to scan the room is there 
none	 any design or purpose to the  layout of the room anything that stands out besides books  matt as you glance around the room quickly you see there are probably two dozen bookshelf aisle  openings all around this central dome area you begin to look around you dont see any specific  signs go ahead and roll a perception check  liam going to use my last luck for this sleep cycle natural 20  matt glancing about you dont see any signs on the books you do notice however there are  hundreds of those somewhat spectral 
none	 keepers of the library that are moving tomes through and  organizing and relocating things just like you saw when you first entered  sam theyre spectral  matt theyre spectral yeah  sam im going to go try to talk to one of them  matt okay one of thems currently pulling books out you can see the basic shimmering outline of a  humanoid form and theyre taking a book off and stacking it and finding another  sam hello sir do you have language can you speak  matt he turns and looks to you for a 
none	 second  sam can you help us find a book it contains an incantation of isolation  travis or about the chained oblivion  sam or about the chained oblivion  laura or about the calamity or something  taliesin where are the lives of those who witnessed it  matt it doesnt seem to be at this moment  sam no chance  laura im going to hop on my broom to see if i get a ping on my locate object  sam wait before we start flying around what do we know when was this last used 
none	 this book 886  years ago or whatever right 812 years ago  laura wow you know that  sam well its 812 pwhatever pd right so 812 years ago so were looking for a very old book  that was used by ioun who was it used by  travis potentially or the dawnfather helped seal with ioun  marisha correct  sam so its some sort of a wizards or sorcerers tome  marisha i have a question didnt one of us have a potion or scroll of languagespeaking didnt we  have that  laura do any 
none	 of the tomes have titles on them though  matt glancing about and some of them do theyre all in celestial  taliesin im going to read off some titles  marisha yeah primordial  matt none visibly currently in primordial  sam is that the language they used before the  laura i feel like celestial would be what the dawnfather would speak though  marisha celestial would be close i would think more close than primordial  matt so make an investigation check who else is looking through books  laura i dont speak celestial so it doesnt 
none	 really matter  matt well make separate investigation checks  taliesin 12  marisha were making investigation checks  matt anybody whos searching currently or doing something that involves searching through books  liam 26  laura 21  marisha 20  taliesin 12  matt okay  darin 22  matt all right you guys begin fanning out and its so overwhelming its so immense theres  thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of books within your immediate visual vicinity and  like i said about 150 feet beyond you it seems to fade into shadow and the 
none	 more you walk towards  that shadow it reveals more books they curve and spiral and almost seem to intertwine into that  escher paintinglike advance towards the ceiling you dont see  laura does it seem like some are older than others  matt yeah they seem scattered as youre going around you find some are celestial the further  away from the center you get you do find some sections that are other languages you see some  that are in abyssal you dont find any that are primordial yet  travis scattered amongst or categorized by language 
none	  matt the ones that are nearest to the center here are all names they are all names of people  laura okay  sam so we need to find one thats not a name of a person  darin who used the incantation of isolation perhaps if we find the book of the user we will  find their spells  laura was it pelor does pelor have a book  sam are they dead  travis no it continues writing right potentially theres a book  sam so theres a book that says pelor on it or ioun 
none	 or dawnfather  liam or if vecna is a dead man maybe a book with vecnas name on it  laura i dont know why the incantation of isolation would be  sam hey percy are these books arranged in any order chronological name anything oh you  didnt see anything when you looked  matt youre having a hard time really finding any pattern to the books  taliesin fuck theres no pattern  laura can i look at the bookbinding though do some books seem like they fall apart more  matt yeah theres a wide variety of 
none	 ages and types the sense of the pattern of the sections of  books some of them seem to be clustered together and some of them seem to have similar colorations  the further into the side the further out you get from this the more scattered they get its almost  like the organization begins from the center and either theyre reorganized for reasons that are  beyond your comprehension you get the sense as you begin to hear this slight grinding you got  the natural 20  liam earlier yeah  matt yep so youve been glancing 
none	 about and looking about you pick up the slight sound  grinding and you look up and you can see some of these shelves coming down from the  ceiling that are stopping about 30 feet above you are sliding and moving the actual library seems to  have some sort of slow rearranging movement to it  liam pop out the wings go up  marisha i start looking at the ceiling is there any type of what are those the observatory  what are those called percy the celestial tell you the stars thing  taliesin oh like 
none	 some sort of astrolabe or something like that  marisha yeah astrolabe you know those big rotating things you can put in the year and the  month in the calendar  matt oh right nothing youve seen so far make a perception check  marisha what am i looking for perception check thats good 17 30 total  matt looking around your current vicinity you see nothing like that  taliesin are there any books in the bowl  matt there are a handful on one of the tables that are around  taliesin im going to take a 
none	 look at whats in the bowl  travis i jump in and start throwing pillows around did she leave anything cool behind  matt as youre throwing the pillows some of them fling off to the side and you uncover a couple of  empty cups of tea  travis i drink them  matt all right you get some stale librarytemperature tea you do find a couple of  large books on one of the nearby tables  travis ooh i found a large book on one of the nearby tables  taliesin im going to read the names 
none	 of these books  matt okay one of them the name is jaina kumor doesnt ring a bell and another one appears to be  a book that pertains to the attempts of creating alchemical transitions from one base element to  another essentially what was the attempt at a philosophers stonelike object long ago and the  various trials and tribulations and unfortunate deaths that occurred because of it  sam interesting  liam do i see anything different 100 150 feet up does the change in perspective on the room  below reveal anything  matt the change 
none	 in perspective shows you one you do finally see a ceiling and its like two  mirrored libraries in the ceiling and the floor there are bookshelves that come up and stop and  there are bookshelves that come down and stop and you look up and you can see there are other  spirits hanging upside down walking along the pathways above as well  sam wait so its like a mirror image the top and bottom  matt yeah but theyre not exact mirror images theres just a bottom and a top part of the  library  
none	 sam what if that line is the demarcation between predivergence and postdivergence or something  like that  laura thats cool go up and in  sam i cant  laura here get on the broom scanlan well fly up  matt all right so scanlan you jump on her broom whooshing you fly up whos taking a  look make an investigation check if you do  sam im going to take a look but im going to pull out my ioun stone and clutch it in my hand  and close my eyes and pray on it for 
none	 a second hope that guides me in some way  matt roll a religion check  sam religion check okay well thats terrible  travis luck  sam i dont have luck i can inspire myself i will inspire myself with a little song singing  scanlancito hes got tiny feetoh but he likes to cast spells he does it with his beatoh when  you go to sleepoh better check your sheetohs because after he eatsohs he likes to take a  shitoh  laughter  travis oh my god are you fucking kidding me what the hell man 
none	  liam get that book  matt yeah you earned that d12  sam thats a 12 so that brings it up to 21  matt okay this is your investigation check to search about oh no thats your religion check  all right clutching the ioun stone as you sing this song the stone glows ever so faintly in your  hand and you glance up and you can see about ten of the various spectral librarians that are  wandering have stopped and theyre all looking at you seemingly temporarily distracted or entranced  by the song  
none	 laura lets go try to talk to one  sam okay whoa  matt you land next to all the librarians and as soon as you land theres like a moment of quiet  and they all go about their business again  sam on behalf of the mistress ioun i speak in her name and ill hold up the stone  laura its always good to lie  sam well she tasked me its not a lie she tasked me with this we seek a book we would love  some help and it contains the incantation of isolation 
none	 maybe about 812 years oldish maybe  813  matt no one seems to be paying attention to your words  laura and taliesin maybe sing it  sam i have to sing it  liam pull out mythcarver  laura pull out mythcarver and sing  sam oh okay i pull out a sword sword unsheathing  laura just sing like its a microphone  sam okay singing just take a look its in a book the scanlan rainbow i can read anything  matt you watch as the same librarians all of a sudden stop what theyre doing 
none	 and turn back  towards you the sword is vibrating and ringing its expanding the notes of your song as is the  nature of mythcarver you seem to have their attention  laura now ask now sing and question  matt its been about 20 minutes by the way  laura oh jesus i mean ioun  sam singing i sing to you in desperation im looking for a tome of isolation we need to find a  tome so we can go home and kill a guy named vecna it would really make us nothing rhymes  with 
none	 vecna  matt roll a performance check  sam 29  matt you watch as the librarians gather theyre up above you and they gather closely to you as  youre singing this song and as you finish your final verse they all look a little confused and  they all begin to shift as one unit around the edge of one of the bookcases  marisha scanlan yells scanlan  sam yells what  laura we have an earring  marisha oh right sorry  sam its a library keep quiet  marisha your stories its your storytelling keep 
none	 telling the story about the calamity maybe  if you talk about vecna some more and what happened  sam i dont know my history  matt roll a history check  darin tell him heck nah rhymes with vecna if it helps at all  sam 23  matt vecna didnt have too much involvement in the calamity directly the calamity mainly  involved the gods battling it involved the chained oblivion it involved the sealing of that  deity during one of the major battles of the calamity those are elements of the history that  pertain to 
none	 the calamity that you recall  laura were following the little surge of spectrals  sam okay im just going to keep talking i guess rapping the book were looking for is  fraught with insanity it dates back to the time of calamity its about a guy with oblivion  chains you know his name  laughter  sam rapping whats his name yo speaking i got nothing  laura singing hes the chained oblivion his name is the chained oblivion  travis singing and theres a million things he hasnt done  matt singing because hes sealed  
none	 matt laura taliesin and marisha singing because hes sealed  travis oh fuck linmanuel just turned it off  matt okay sorry all right so as you continue to sing with each beat each name thats  mentioned that deals with the calamity and the chained oblivion you watch as their pace seems to  quicken a bit and then as the singing slows they begin to slow down again theres a specific  correlation and drive between your storytelling and your singing and apparently the drive in  which theyre pushing towards their  laura keep telling the story

none	 oh my god  darin call back to earlier discussion and nobody knows  liam singing god i hope i get it  sam singing the book is eight centuries old or so im told its fraught with mystery its  teeming with history so please listen to me and dont kiss me because i really need this book  right now  matt roll another performance check  marisha yes come on  sam no 22  matt 22 okay they continue to push at a brisk pace and you watch as other of the spectral  librarians begin 
none	 to gather into this group and is now a cluster of about 25 of them that are snaking  around these bookcases and traveling at a pretty fair pace which once was walking pace and then  went to a jogging pace theyre now darting through and theyre leading you quickly away from  the center of the library where everyone else seems to be clustered  so the two of you are following and swooshing behind them youre going over and around  bookcases some of the bookcases you see have giant holes in the center and you can 
none	 dart through  and dive past the speed is increasing to the point where the wind is starting to kick up in  your hair and youre amazed at the speed of these librarians and the fact that theyre being driven  by your very song and also the fact that you have no idea how far away the rest of your friends are  in this library and this library seems to just go on and on and on  you continue forward for another ten minutes or so so youve hit just over the 30minute mark at  
none	 this point and you feel this little pulse from the stone do you continue to inspire  sam i will do one more i hope it works ill recite a poem this little gnomey went to the  heavens this little gnomey wants to go home this little gnomey is looking for a book this little  gnomey is trusting ioun this little gnomey wants to go weeweeweewee all the way to this tome  cheering  matt roll a performance check with advantage  sam natural 20  cheering  matt didnt even need it  marisha hashtag blessed 
none	  matt so the speed is dangerous to the point where as trying to follow them you almost lose sight of  them a couple of times you being the driver of this i need you to go ahead and make a perception  check to make sure you can keep them in your vision  travis damn scanlan got bars yall  laura 22  matt 22 okay thats enough you nearly lose them a few times and youre like grunts you  have to take a second and listen out there and you see a faint glow of 
dung	 their spectral form in the  distance there and so you continue to give chase then eventually at about the 40minute  mark or so you come to the outside whats interesting too is a lot of these bookcases are  made of different materials some of them are dark wood light wood some of them are metal and  various substances you come to on the ceiling jammed in a bookcase but its made of a very  dark slate gray metal and it has chains across it and a series of locks on it  laura whispers i 
none	 had a feeling it would be a locked bookcase  matt and you see them all the librarians are clustered and circled around it right now  laura singing can they open it up  sam oh singing can you open it up  travis find somebody that can pick them locks  matt theres no response from them  sam wait they can pick books  matt they can pick up books  laura vax can you hear me  liam i dont know 500 feet  matt youve been traveling for a while he doesnt hear you  
none	 laura i can try to pick it i can try  marisha come on multiclassing into that rogue now  matt all right so you fumble around and quickly pull out your thieves tools all right go ahead  and roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier and your proficiency bonus  laura my proficiency bonus  sam im going to inspire her  matt okay  sam singing im so vain i probably think this song is about me im so vain  laura yeah i got a one on your inspiration thanks for that but i rolled well 
none	 so it doesnt  matter hopefully 19 plus my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus 30  sam wow  liam she rolled a 19  matt the dc was 30  sam it was the inspiration  laura no plus inspiration was 31  matt yeah the dc on that was 30  laura oh jeebies  sam there are dcs up to 30  matt yeah 30s considered nearly impossible  marisha were badasses now  travis what happens when you say that shit  marisha no im just saying the difficulties are going to get harder  
none	 laura oh in god realm it will be harder  matt so as you work your way down the chain you get through a few of them and theres one big  lock in the center thats bolted into a big double doorway or hinged opening to this bookcase this  one takes you a few moments to get into clicking it snaps your lockpick as soon as you  hear the tink your heart sinks but you still have a little bit of leverage and you push forward  on the broken pick and its just enough to get 
none	 the tumbler to click in your lockpick is busted  youre going to have to get a new one however it does open on one side  laura thats the hardest lock ive ever picked i swear  matt you open and you can see about 25 different books of different shapes sizes colors all  ancient that are all in this small locked section  laura are any of the spectrals looking at one specifically  matt no they are all just at the side  laura can you do your ioun stone  sam sure ill blacklight it 
none	  laura does it glow for anything in particular  matt you take your ioun stone and as you go across it doesnt seem to have an effect  sam im going to quickly scan the books to see if any of them look particularly old  laura can i read any of them  matt what languages do you know  laura elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic  matt and you  sam not much gnome marquesian and common  matt there are about ten of them you cannot read there is one book that has nothing on 
none	 the spine  its blank about five of them appear to be in abyssal you reading through them a lot of them  talk about they are history books that talk about the lord of the hells theres one that speaks on  rites and rituals of sacrifice there is one that talks about the annihilation of a race that no  longers exists in the world during the age of arcanum theres one that talks about the birth of  the rune children theres all these books that all talk about different things but nothing seems  to stand 
none	 out to you as the tome you might be looking for  laura well i could potentially grab all of them and shove them in the bag of colding  sam and then what how many minutes are left and how far are we from our friends  matt you have about 15 minutes left and its about ten minutes of travel  sam we could take them all back and see if anyone can read  laura it seems pretty shitty dumping them out in a pile but i dont know what else to do  travis yeah the 
dung	 spiritsll put them back  sam the one that has nothing on the binding can i open that and flip through real quick  laura i start grabbing other ones and putting them in the bag  matt you pull out the one with nothing on it its a very thin book its only about that wide  or so its a dark gray leather it looks damaged part of its burnt and scarred on the outside  theres no words on the cover you open it up and its about four pages that are blank  sam this is 
none	 the thing  laura what can you do do you have a spell that lets you see things reveals things  sam i do not  travis talk to it  sam okay sure  laura yeah sing to it or something  sam sure ill sing to a book matt singing read to me of times gone by can it be youre here  when a bunch of gods died speaking okay thats all i got  matt doesnt seem to have any effect doesnt seem to respond to the singing  sam dont tell anyone i sang to 
none	 a book  laura you just keep singing ill keep taking books weve got not enough time  matt it takes you about a minute to throw them all in there haphazardly  travis and laura 25 books  sam lets get back  matt you guys dart back you get low enough to the point where youre in between the two  bookcaess the heights vary and in some case youre having to suddenly shift up and over to  avoid slamming into the side of the large bookcase youre shooting through this almost  like an up and 
none	 down version of the star wars entry to the death star thank you my brains not  working  laura my locate object never pinged my incantation of isolation locate object  matt interestingly enough thank you for reminding me of that as soon as he pulled the  book out the one that hes holding the one with no text on it it pinged  laura oh shit i just grabbed a bunch of books but thats the one  sam are you sure  laura its got to be keep looking at it while were flying see if 
none	 you can figure it out  sam hold it upside down  laura hold onto me though because were going fast  sam im going to listen to it  matt okay make an arcana check  sam 13 plus five 18  matt 18 as youre darting by youre clutching your side with your hand around her waist reading  it you almost lose it a couple times  sam plus jack of all trades  matt so whats the total  sam 21  matt 21 you get the sense that there is something magical about it i 
none	 would say you cant  put your finger on it but what faint arcane essence that you can sense from your usage of  spells and the feeling of releasing spells the charging and release of arcane energy you get  the sense of that release from the book its almost wanting something its pulling something  very faintly  sam what spell i dont want to hurt it  laura place mythcarver on it place mythcarver in it  sam okay ill place mythcarver on it i dont know what to cast on a book  matt make a 
none	 dexterity saving throw  sam ill cast friends on it  laura that was almost so bad  matt you cast friends on it  sam sure  matt okay as you release the cantrip the book seems to absorb the magic but no reaction  laura 28  matt 28 as you dart around the corner one of the shifting bookcases comes right in front of  you and you just dart out of the way in time scanlan you barely hold on i need you to roll a  strength check  laura oh god can i hold 
none	 onto his wrist to help out  sam not good strength  matt this would be a strength saving throw yeah  sam ten  matt ten the books like bouncing and you catch it right as it falls and you hold it in your  hand  travis what if you write in it  laura yeah what if you write in it and say hey i need the incantation of isolation  sam write in the book  travis didnt you ever watch harry potter he wrote in the book and it wrote back  sam no ive 
none	 never watched harry potter  taliesin who are you  travis do you have a quill can you write it in can you write something in the book  sam i must have a quill right im a storyteller  matt youd have to pull it out of your pouch yeah  sam okay ill pull out my quill  matt and your inkwell  sam jesus while were flying this seems like a bad idea this is a bad idea  matt do you want to try it  sam no how about when we land  laura did 
none	 you cast friends on it did it work  sam no it absorbed the spell and seemed to like it but nothing happened  travis what else can you do to imbue it with magic  sam i have the ioun stone but it doesnt do anything  matt as youre rushing make another dexterity saving throw  laura jesus oh god okay 27  matt whoosh you yank out of the way of another one that shifts its one that goes from ceiling to  floor its one solid bookcase that comes right in the way you manage to 
none	 dart around the side make  another strength saving throw to hold onto the book  sam oh thats 17  matt 17 okay the book you hold onto with one hand and you pull it back  sam ill try to cast a more powerful spell into it without hurting it though thats the thing  if i do lightning what if it burns the fucking book ill do thunderwave on it right  matt thunderwave the 1stlevel spell  laura dont you have suggestion  sam yeah ill dominate monster thats a super highlevel spell  matt what 
none	 level spell is that  sam eight  matt 8thlevel spell dominate monster on the book okay as youre flying through you cast the  spell into the book and the book takes the entirety of the spell into it and you watch as  suddenly text emboldens across all the pages on the inside the book is now filled with  scribblings and writing  laura what language is it  sam i dont know what language is it  matt it appears to be common to you  yelling  sam its a notebook its somebody who was 
none	 figuring this out as they were writing it  matt you glance over your shoulder and its empty  laura are you sure somethings there  sam yes i have a beautiful mind  laughter  matt with that you arc down into the center of the library where you see the large dome where you  first met ioun youre not sure how much time you have left but its down to the wire  sam do i see any words that say isolation or incantation or anything  laura its a small book  sam i like to 
none	 read things and really understand  matt the script on the cover seems in a weird way the best i could say is a google translate  version but it loosely translates to the tome of isolation yes  laura its the whole thing  sam its a cookbook  travis she just asked for the tome right you got it  laura and sam yeah  marisha alone i am tome  travis she disappeared where is she  laura shes going to reappear obviously she knows were here  sam lets go down to her bowl  laura 
none	 yeah were at the bowl  sam all right so lets go down into the bowl and wait for her to arrive  matt you guys land in the center there whats everybody else doing right now  liam i barrel rolled out of the way as they rushed by  taliesin i was sitting on the couch  travis ive been digging through the pillows  laura looking for change in the couch  darin did you know that heck nah could rhyme with vecna did you hear what i said  sam i heard when you yelled it 
none	 it was the neck ma that i couldnt come up with a way  darin if youre speaking to your mother lets say and pointing at your neck  laura youre such a pain in the neck ma  darin exactly pain in the neck ma looking for vecna hes a pain in the neck ma find him i  say heck nah  sam i wish you would have been chosen by ioun  matt as soon as that happens the wind picks up and for a moment you close your eyes from the  sudden burst of air 
none	 into your face as you reopen and adjust there in the center of the dome where  she was before you see the knowing mistress there resting her arms crossed in front of her  robes she looks out are you to present your findings  sam i casually blow the hair out of my face and walk over to her and say o mighty goddess it was  a challenging challenge but i think youll be pretty happy with the results as i hold up the  book ill cast wrist pocket and make it disappear oh god oh 
none	 its gone just kidding and  its back  matt she doesnt flinch  sam this is what weve found for you i hope it pleases you  matt and this is your final choice  sam you know we didnt actually look at the other ten books  travis regis philbin  liam is that your final answer  sam yes with conviction i firmly believe that this is the correct book  matt very well she takes it and looks at it it has been a while since i thumbed through these  pages myself this will do 
none	 you well in the coming fray and she hands it out to you  sam can i still see the writing  matt yeah  sam ill cherish it always  matt you who have wandered the vast library that surrounds you through your knowledge through  your magnetic telling and spinning of yarns through your knowledge of history perseverance  and apparently decent grip have managed to return to me and complete the challenge i set before you  and for that i grant my grace unto you for the coming fray scanlan shorthalt and its a little  
none	 offputting at first but in her forehead where you saw her two purple eyes a third eye opens up  in the center of the forehead it seems to glow for a second you watch as on scanlan this warmth  fills your body you stand up straight instinctually you guys watch as this strange  purple glow appears in the center of his forehead in the same place where her eye was  laura ugh you have a third eye  sam is it cool or is it gross  travis and liam its cool  sam chicks will 
none	 dig  travis yep third nip third eye youre good  matt it gently fades away the warmth vanishes and youre restored to yourself that given the  case you have the tome of isolation and the blessing of the knowing mistress  liam you chose wisely  sam okay i gain plus two to my intelligence whoa  marisha all the timesies  sam as a bonus action i can channel the omniscience of ioun for one hour whenever you  successfully hit a creature with a spell or attack you can learn one of the creatures stats  
none	 of your choice from the following list ac senses saving throw bonuses damage resistances  damage immunities damage vulnerabilities during this hour you also have advantage on initiative  rolls and on saving throws once this ability is used it cannot be used again for a week okay  marisha how many things can you learn about  sam just one  laura we can learn what its vulnerabilities are  liam thats like a game mod for a character  travis its the gold thing that came with the original nintendo entertainment system the game  genie  liam 
none	 i certainly remembered my charlemagne let my armies be the  liam and taliesin  rocks and the trees and birds in the sky  sam the tome as an action i can expend a spell slot of any level higher than three thank you  travis the cover and the pages glow of secret text of the rites of prime banishment while  legible you can spend an action to invoke the rites of banishment against the target the target  must make a wisdom saving throw on a failure the target is banished and sealed and this book 
none	 is  immediately teleported to the endless atheneeum on a success the text becomes blurred until the  end of your next turn  laura on a success  sam on a success on a failure of their saving throw right yeah  matt if they succeed on their saving throw they resist the ability and you cannot read the book  for another turn  sam got it then after that turn i can read it again  laura what does it say the dc is  sam dc ten a wisdom saving throw oh thats key info plus 
none	 five to dc for each divine trammel  fused to the target weve got to be matadors and attach a bunch of pegs to the thing before we  deliver the killing blow  laura we literally stick the trammels onto vecna  sam well be picadors right they put the darts on the back of the bull to soften it up and  whoosh killing blow  marisha and do we have any of these yet  laura i have one no i have a stone  matt you have a stone that supposedly has something to do with 
none	 their construction  marisha but we were supposed to ask ioun  laura yeah im going to  sam no i think were done here guys  liam well just go to home depot and get some trammels  laura can i pull out the little pearl of power  matt all right you pull it out and there it glows before you its bright like a tiny star for  a second and you have to avert your gaze but there it is still warm to the touch the small  pearl of bright divine light with this blessing 
none	 i hope to be of some aid in the coming  battle also any questions you may have im here to answer  sam yes so many  laura how do we make a trammel we have a stone and we want more i assume  matt the prime trammel you speak of the companion to this rite of which youve sought out  and recovered the construct is small but complex the design is unknowable for most mortal  eyes each trammel requires a fragment of divinity you have one there that fragment is  lost until the seal 
none	 is broken so it is a very exhausting process for a deity to give this  fragment  now the original trammels that we had utilized were forged by the hand of the allhammer atop the  fiery core anvil deep beneath the ozmit sea  marisha wait the core  matt the core anvil  laura in the ozmit sea  matt to seal a god the number of trammels you will require depends on how marred the god may be  you have an easier chance of applying the trammels the more wounded the entity is it is 
none	 imperfect  and its only been given use the once against the chained oblivion with the luck bringers  blessing we succeeded against the entity it took us four trammels and the full might of pelor upon  the beast to banish it beyond the veil however the chained oblivions power was fully realized at  this time  now the core anvil this was part of the domain of the allhammers greatest creations it was  where the first dwarves were given form and breath its where the trammels were carved and  made in the last great war 
none	 it lies beneath the undersea volcano now known as scaldseat  laura scaldseat  matt scaldseat it sits at the bottom of the ocean off the eastern coast of issylra not far  from the fishing village known as shorecomb  at which point the third eye flashes in the direction of keyleth keyleth a vision fills your  mind suddenly of the shoreline over issylra the cold cloudcovered sky but you see below grass  and recent rainfallcovered fields that lead to a somewhat marshy and mudcovered shoreline there  you see a small fishing village leading out to 
none	 a rocky beachfront and waves that crest and break  against a dropoff into the ocean you can see some lowbuilt docks that lead all the fishermen  in and out into the ocean the vision pulls you back miles away from that you get a sense as you  see this small column of black smoke that emerges from the ocean across endless open sea that is  the signal of where this volcano lies  the vision fades from you she leans to you and says find a way below through the tunnels of  toxic fume unbreathable 
none	 without proper preparation to the core anvil and forge these  trammels be warned there may be protections that still remain within the forgotten halls of the  allhammer or new denizens that occupy the subterranean depths now to forge such a trammel  however is an undertaking no mortal has attempted to shape the materials would require  the strength of a titan  she looks towards you and the eye flashes and suddenly your mind fills with hundreds of years of  the knowledge of folding heated metals of the clinks of lives past shaping and building weapons 
none	  and armor and for a second you pull back and you can see the large dwarflike stone form of the  allhammer slamming down onto the heated metals of the core anvil as the vision fades you know how  to forge so you are now proficient with blacksmithing tools  travis proficient with blacksmithing tools  laura awesome oh my god you were a boot maker and now youre a weapon maker  matt suddenly you understand most of the tools in percys workshop  travis that waters not so evil after all  laughter  travis wait 
none	 a minute  matt but not just the strength of a titan for to understand the intricacies of this design will  also require the ingenuity of a madman she turns towards you percy  travis dont look at somebody else motherfucker thats you  marisha trying to look away kid at the back of the classroom  liam percy takes one step behind keyleth  travis its like the kid that farts in class and then looks at the guy behind him  matt the third eye opens once more and flashes you see the purple glow in the 
none	 center of  percivals forehead for a moment in an instant the intricate designs of the prime trammel flood  into your mind the celestial instructions racing through like a shock of electricity the  blueprints spinning like a clear dream straight out of flight of the navigator all of the star  charts being crammed at once with that it drops from your mind and you fall to your knees with a  pounding headache  taliesin im not supposed to know that groans  matt and you will only know it for as long as its required she 
none	 thinks for a second we the  creators did breathe the beauty into this world we planted the seeds that would blossom into this  incredible weave of exandria however what is the purpose of the parent but to teach what they can  then set the children free some gods rule through fear others through love and others still  through perceived fate destiny has its place but the real deception is that you have no choice a  path can be groomed before you but it is you who must take those steps not every rosy walkway  
none	 leads to a better day  for me our greatest purpose has passed the moment we granted your forbearers the spark to  seek their own purpose we now stay to inspire to guide to guard the gate to keep the hate of  ignorance we spawned in our hubris from burning away everything the rest is up to you we need  you perhaps but you do not need us that is our gift you fatetouched you are the embodiment of  this truth all mortal life has potential with or without the gods we offer some paths but 
none	 its up  to you to decide if they are the right ones for you anyway and she clutches her stomach a  moment what more do you ask of me what more do you wish to know  liam i have questions  matt yes ask  liam vecna youre familiar you know not where he is you know of him  matt i know as much of his history as i was allowed to see yes vecna was a force of  insurmountable intellect among mortals and his creative bending of known arcane theory enabled  many of 
dung	 the powerful artifacts of war that stoked the flames of the calamity a century later his  contributions were appreciated but overlooked by those around him in his hubris he sought to  carve history in his image he sought forgotten magics and slew those who shared this same  knowledge to leave only him standing with it he bypassed his own mortality through terrible  necromantic rites to lichdom amassing a force of likeminded followers and hordes of undead  terrors then vanished into the shadowfell to overtake the dark city of thar amphala where he  erected the 
none	 terrible tower entropis from this very seat of power vecna harnessed an event  called the celestial solstice he used this merging of ley energies and power to reforge  manses of energy all across exandria to suit his needs opening the portals at his whim within his  city to anywhere across the world allowing his armies to lay siege to anything before him and  extend his influence and rule his horde assaulted a couple of prominent townships slaughtering  denizens and forcing old enemies to kneel before slaying and raising them as his own  one such 
none	 rival was named kas who upon their defeat was offered eternal life through vampirism  in exchange for swearing fealty to vecna as his chief lieutenant this made kas into kas the  bloodyhanded vecna forged a relic blade for him with a fraction of his consciousness and gifted it  to his new lieutenant and with this the lich lord had become a new terror among the rising  tensions of the bickering nations months of turmoil followed as the shadow of vecnas  unstoppable forces struck with precision and those fled before retaliation however the use of the 
none	  solstice was discovered and reverseengineered allowing the holy army the beacon of arms to storm  his city under the banner of the dawnfather led by the champion yos varder  climbing entropis to face the lich lord in combat yos varder was struck down by the undying  king with a mortal blow in the final moments of the heros life he witnessed the lieutenant kas  turn on his winded master and strike him with the very blade he was gifted driven to usurp him to  become his own new lord the ensuing conflict left kas 
none	 nothing but ash and utterly destroyed  vecnas body leaving nothing but his left eye and hand yos passed on to the realm of pelor due to  his wounds and the survivors left the shadowfell with tales of victory  the terrible artifacts the eye the hand the sword were never recovered the sword is bent on  vengeance on hatred for the whispered one a powerful evil drives that sword but for a just  end should one be able to find and tame such a thing it may be of great use  that is all i 
none	 have to offer on the history of vecna and i hope it can be of aid to you in your  coming battle  taliesin what was the name of the sword  matt the sword of kas  marisha the sword of kas okay  laura did it have a name  taliesin where was it last seen  matt in thar amphala at the scene of the battle  marisha oh okay the sword of kas  laura you dont think  sam i dont think what are the odds right  travis it was 800 years ago 
none	  marisha and sam different sword  travis not craven edge  liam i have another question for you  matt yes  liam you know who i serve  matt i do i see the shadows that cling to you  liam vecna seeks godhood and we understand that my lady achieved the same did you learn anything  from her path that would help us here  matt sighs you watch as suddenly her expression changes her mouth falls open ever so gently and  her hair wavy and calm seems to curl in but a moment and 
none	 lift her expression falls to one of  trepidation and horror and then there was one more  the ritual is complete i can sense his ascension the cosmos expand to make room  our timetable accelerates you can see now her eyes begin to race back and forth it will take  him some time to understand and utilize his nature fully if he expands beyond his avatar it will be  more difficult to seal him the more trammels it may require and the loss maybe far greater  laura do you have a seed of power  
none	 matt understand and she leans forward to you i am not ioun given full form but a partial  avatar of my essence given shape by the worship of my children as was the dawnfather that guided you  here our realms are our bodies and our true presence held in the hearts of those that grant us  their faith to hold purely as an avatar like this is dangerous for while it focuses and grants us  much present power as we were forced to do in the calamity in the last great war it may also leave 
none	  us open to grievous injury  she opens her robe and there you can see amongst the olivegold skin you see a large darkened gash  that still festers unhealed to this day of black curling void as you look at this open  wound you feel yourself drawn toward it your vision begins to be pulled towards this infinite  nothing she closes it you can see a bit of sweat dripping from the brow  the cost was great but necessary vecnas ascended being is fresh he will need to expand  his worship vastly to learn 
none	 how to disseminate his power and claim his domains what he will need for  this to happen is a display of unstoppable power a miracle of terror a wave of despair that would  occupy the hearts of many in but a moment i know not his method but i know enough of his ways to  assume theres already a plan in motion and has been for some time if you can strike before he  claims his full ascension before he can seize his dominion on this plane than you may still have a  chance  
none	 she turns to you scanlan you are the teller of tales one who enlivens the world through song and word  take this fragment of my own story and help craft the passages of the worlds future she reaches  into the center of her robe and almost seems to be into her chest and plucks forth a small gray  gem about the size of a peanut it glows faintly and as she removes it you hear a terrible  creaking sound throughout the library you watch as books plummet from the darkness above and slam  into the 
none	 ground around you distant cases crack and bow the roar of the damaged space echoes to a  halt the danger seemingly in control there i can spare no more i must rest and concentrate  darin i have something of you inside of me would it help you  matt she smiles i could use a steward for a moment someone eager to learn and relearn some  important lessons ethred brokenbranch  darin thats me  matt would you be so kind as to help an old woman tend to her books a bit  darin it would 
none	 be my pleasure i didnt believe in you i didnt think you were real but i found  out that things arent what we seem and things can change it would be my honor stammers could  i say goodbye  matt of course  darin also do you know where theres an imp by the name of demistrik and if hes all right  matt hes fine for now  darin im not asking for me the nice lady with the antlers wanted to know  matt hes fine but woe to those who live in the home in

none	 gods in our lives  taliesin you know  marisha i dont think they fancy us much i dont really fancy them though so i guess thats fair  theyre allowed that  taliesin im not angry  marisha sighs me neither  taliesin my books are still lovely the library is still lovely it made a lot of things better  marisha you know i felt really guilty about it for a while like something was wrong with me i  dont understand why i didnt feel it why i didnt understand i dont think it was until  
none	 sarenrae and even ioun just now mentioned that we serve that balance and that nonbelievers are  necessary it made me feel like a little bit less of a fuckup i guess in this whole situation  taliesin i think youre just fine laughs mostly  marisha apparently youre a madman  taliesin apparently  marisha a god called you a madman  taliesin i know honestly im a little touched  marisha its kind of a compliment  taliesin yeah if it werent for the migraine im sorry by the way you may be the only one who  
dung	 understands this but i needed something that was mine for a little while so little of who we are  is ours and i knew it would end but it was nice  marisha wow  taliesin ioun is quite a goddess and she does not respect secrets though i on the other hand  feel that secrets can be precious  marisha apparently i just dont understand why you were still enigmatic after you already told us in  front of pelor its kind of a slap in the face  taliesin well i thought she may kill me 
dung	 at that point i was honestly fearing for my life  there a little bit and at that point everything was so awkward  marisha i hope you know my frustration is only out of well what you just said i guess  wanting something to be mine that i wont have  taliesin well well see i dont know  marisha some things you dont get to keep  taliesin yes one of the bonuses of not being one of the chosen of the gods is we dont have to  believe in destiny we just i think heard 
none	 a big speech from a god about not believing in destiny  marisha i followed destiny my whole life it wasnt until i got to the end that i realized the  whole thing was ironic  taliesin why do we have to listen to anything they say  marisha and taliesin cheers  marisha cheers to the faithless i kind of inhaled a little bit  taliesin that was a plant youve been holding a plant and ive been holding a book that got  weird  marisha i dont even know where we got these glasses in the 
none	 story  taliesin i think that was legitimately you were still holding a potted plant  marisha oh god spluttering this coffees been there for a while  sam crudite crudite  laughter  taliesin how does it feel to be chosen by a goddess at this point  sam who me  taliesin yes you i know youve been listening  travis no i pull scanlan aside  taliesin we all watch  sam a moment alone please  travis i want to see it  sam my cube  travis no the seed the little bean  sam

none	 the assassin guy that we were going to ask  taliesin it was an undead thing it was just going to make a tongue at us  matt he wasnt really going to offer information anyway  sam who are you  marisha who the fuck are you  travis thats vecna  laura is that the imp  matt no standing by the doorway you see there arms crossed casually standing before you  vecna  shouting and screaming  matt laughs welcome back you must have traveled quite a distance to be far from my sight  laura 
none	 is he seethrough i try to shoot an arrow at him  matt okay roll for an attack  liam cocked  laura no thats not cocked cocked 29  matt 29 whoosh it passes through his body  laura i fucking knew it  matt he laughs for a second and you see him smiling his terrible grin across curled yellowed  teeth you see that flicker of green energy sparking in his left eye it seems to pulse as his  brow arches above it i admire your resolve you did it you solved the riddle you found 
none	 my home  ruined my tower slew one of my greatest acolytes and even then you failed still impressive that  is most definitely worthy of a fine round of applause  laura thank you  matt the smug clapping comes to a halt he nods youre the only ones to get away others found me  before you did and another group of supposed heroes came and assaulted me shortly after you  vanished no matter they all failed and rose again  taliesin perception check  laura insight maybe  marisha insight is he fucking lying  matt 
none	 insight check go for it if you want to make one  laura who was it natural 20  marisha oh yes  laura thanks for doublechecking it is like i would lie about a natural fucking 20  liam thats a six shes lying  marisha 22  sam whispers  laura hes the god of secrets what do you expect  liam the pencils are adorable  marisha they are so cute  sam you know what guys i didnt know that this was ever a thing  liam you didnt know we were making pencils dont you 
none	 remember the holy vox machina text  thread  marisha we definitely sent them in the text thread  sam weve thrown out so many cool ideas on that text thread  laura when i say hey name your quote on the text thread then you send in a quote that means  its probably pretty solid  sam i get asked for personal quotes all the time  matt consider your path one of earned existence i would recommend you not waste such a rare lease  on your arrogant lives  liam im going to walk right up 
none	 to him while hes talking and inspect his ugly fucking face  matt you see through his beautifully adorned crushed velvet robes with gold trim you see the  tattered edges where gems and baubles hang around his neck you can see the tendons and muscle that  are pulled taut against his skin that is drawn against his nearlyskeletal frame he smiles back  at you looking down from that one sickly almost pale blue iris and that green glowing burst of  energy where his other eye would be  liam hows that eye socket doing friend  
none	 matt well these are the concerns of a mortal my vision sees far more than it once did  marisha while hes rambling can keyleth be looking for the nearest bigass tree  matt sure theres plenty of bigass trees in your area  travis booby traps  marisha any clear path of least resistance  matt look at all these bigass trees  taliesin also is there anybody in the forest  marisha natural 19  matt theres plenty to see and you dont see anybody else nearby in the forest  marisha path of least resistance without traps 
none	  matt yeah you see a path you can take  liam im not entirely certain i am mortal anymore  matt i know what you are and i know you know where i am come to me whenever you like  liam oh fuckstick we are coming  matt are you all too bloody daft to see its over im no longer the undying king i am the  king of all kings i am not the scourge in secret i am the tyrant unmatched  liam yes youre very grand and i begin to fingerfuck his eyehole in 
none	 the illusion so  majestic  matt as soon as your finger goes forward his image flickers out and appears in the same room  behind you now right up against percy and scanlan  marisha we need to go  matt i am vecna the unholy i am god upon exandria i come to play with the toys left by  insolent forgotten ancients and make this world into a new epoch what this means however is an  end to all an end to borders and nations there will only be the will of vecna so ask  
none	 yourselves you want peace there is no peace the way things are you all bicker and stab and murder  in the names of your mothers your fathers but this one everyone will live and when they die  that need not be the end either under my banner i can see your every move i know your plot i  know your destination i know your plan your capabilities your allies and your imminent  demise should you continue i offer you the chance to stand down discard your imprisoned  gods and pledge to me many you love 
none	 will many you love already have  travis laughs i love it when they come begging for a truce that means hes scared  matt is it more important to throw away your lives against an unstoppable god or to return to  your families  liam grog i think youre right  matt if you persist i will not only destroy you i will erase the memory of you ever existing  from the mind of anyone youve ever known or cared for  laura i dont think you have that power  matt then try me  taliesin 
none	 i think as generous as this offer is we just dont enjoy associating with new money  lets get out of here now  matt very well  laura i only serve gods with big dicks  matt enjoy the forge  marisha i point out the path that way go  matt as the portal opens and you guys go darting off in that direction you hear in the distance  the cackles one after another you all jump through the portal emerging  marisha in vasselheim  matt in vasselheim poof noise all of you dart out just 
none	 as the dusk sun begins to hit on the  distant mountains this far across the ocean  marisha i look around is there vecna anywhere to be seen  matt nowhere  taliesin we need sanctuary can you make your mansion  sam right now  taliesin we need to rest eventually and you need to commune wed better assume were being  seen and heard at all times  laura i wonder if he can see us in your dimension  taliesin maybe not  sam i dont think so  travis he said of exandria  marisha 
none	 he said he couldnt see us when we were in the library  liam where do i feel him now same distance  matt same distance same place  taliesin lets do this quick we need to rest you need to talk theres much to do and this  does not feel good  laura go to raven queens temple right now  sam raven queen or the mansion  laura maybe we can do the mansion outside of her temple  sam sure  taliesin or even inside  travis vasselheim doesnt take very kindly to magic stuff  
none	 laura well be in her temple  marisha arent you also wanted here right now  taliesin i will literally shoot anybody who attempts to deal with it give him your hat  matt the first thing you guys notice as you take in your surroundings even though dusk is  happening there seems to be a larger bustle than youre used to in vasselheim you begin to see  theres a skyship at port and a lot of the various bastions the general bastions the  volunteer army that run across much of the city you see them darting 
none	 back and forth carrying  supplies theres a buzzing energy to the air of the city that you havent seen in a while  taliesin im going to grab someone at some point  marisha i did tell the ashari to start alerting the nearby towns  matt you grab a gentleman who runs past you he has a greying beard with patches of black still  his top of his head is shaved bald and you can see a bit of a tattoo across one half of his face that  curls into his ear hes rushing with a 
none	 cluster of spears under one arm and hes wearing hide armor  on his chest  taliesin you there what is the commotion  matt apparently were gearing up for some sort of assault  taliesin how soon  matt we dont know weve just been told to prepare  taliesin who told  sam probably us  taliesin i just want to find out where it came from  matt the chain of command from the top of the bastions as well apparently from some of the  other temples here are speaking of some entity some vecna  
none	 taliesin good man carry on prepare  matt very well  marisha i bet whenever he ascended all the clerics felt it  laura well be fighting undead more than likely  matt very well he goes to run off two of his compatriots stop and turn and give a slow glance  of recognition towards grog  laura keep running theyve got bigger things happening right now just keep running  matt you guys continue they stare for a second then keep running they look to be preoccupied  but you get the sense that at least word of 
town	 someone matching your image has been disseminated  throughout the town  travis i am quite famous  sam do you want me to disguise you  travis sure why not what am i looking like  sam take this hat  travis i have to attune to it it takes forever  sam fuck all right ill cast seeming on you on all of us because i can  travis will you make me look like tary  laura no what  laughter  laura thats not smart  travis well its not like he was in the room 
none	 where it happened  taliesin the room where it happened  matt the room where it happened  laura keep running toward the raven queen temple as thats happening  marisha we should probably try and use our words as much as possible  sam blue and a foot smaller like blue man group black clothes blue face bald  matt so you have a little more of an aasimar appearance though a larger one than youve seen  laughter  matt all right where are you guys charging off to  liam yeah raven queen temple  matt okay 
none	 youre heading to the ravens crest all right you make your way to the  marisha im going to keep looking around make sure no ones tailing us  matt okay make a perception check  marisha 21  matt 21 all right keeping an eye out you dont see anybody following you at the moment that does  not appear to be an issue so you head to the area of the duskmeadow to the southeast of the city  you come through the dry cold and dusty sector a little bit of snow appears to have melted into 
none	  slush at the corners but most of it has been pushed off the main roads to the side you see  dirty snow matted at the edges you follow vax very quickly through the streets and you see a  few of the veiled maidens of the ravens crest aerie taking note of you and as you approach  they just point over to the ravens crest silently as you walk past  laura quickly quickly walk past  liam im going to walk up the steps and push open the door  matt youre coming from the other 
none	 side as opposed to the main entrance so you rush past the hall  that goes which is the grand library thats attached to the ravens crest  liam everybodys with me right  matt yeah and you come to the front doors they are closed currently but you have two of the  maidens there at the front and as you begin to turn from the side they glance over and give  notice and then turn and push the doors open in preparation with that you all enter ravens  crest itself and looking within you can see 
none	 the beautiful interior of carved obsidians and gold  trims and sigils that are marked and pushed throughout the interior of this structure are you  leading them to the central chamber  liam yeah im bringing everybody with me  matt okay no one stops you and as you head up these stairs into the second chamber and then  finally to the large set of doorways that lead you into the central communion chamber of ravens crest you  guys enter to this beautiful room that is surrounded in stained glass imagery of varying  colors largely in 
dung	 dark purples and reds blues and in the center you see a large circular pool  where a deep crimson liquid sits perfectly still familiar to both percival and vaxildan  liam i walk over to keyleth we need to talk and i plant a big fucking kiss on her mouth and then  i turn to the rest of the group and say nobody fucking touches me do you understand  travis where are you going  laura understood  liam i walk in and i inhale as deeply as i can as i shove my face into the 
none	 blood  laura i hold trinket back so that he doesnt go after him  matt okay  marisha i watch on the side and dont take my eyes off of him  matt okay pike instinctually walks up to the very edge but avoids touching any of the liquid  as you watch vax just bloop noise disappear into this thick liquid no bubbles rise you see a bit  of movement from thrashing beneath the surface and then stillness  marisha is this what he goes through every time  taliesin this is normal  travis is he 
none	 a vampire  taliesin he is not a vampire  sam i think hes dead i think he died in there  taliesin i dont think thats how it works  laura but i do think hes dead  sam hes undead isnt he hes a zombie  taliesin hes not a zombie  marisha his flesh is cold but his heart still beats  matt vaxildan as the panic and pain subsides much easier now than it was your previous  ventures into this communion the darkness surrounds you familiar but you are intent and  you are driven 
none	 the very force of your conversation is pushed out from your personality  into this ether this surrounding infinite void and a familiar voice comes  you burn with intent my feathered boy  liam we need to talk  matt then talk we shall speak your mind you still see nothing around you its just the voice  from the darkness  liam we were too late to stop him vecna  matt i sensed it yes  liam this dead man who wanted to be a god is now a fucking god we have been speaking to your 
none	  brothers and sisters your found family and they are arming us with what we need to fight your  foe you know who he is he is upon us and i have come to you for aid and as i have learned he is  somewhat akin to you he was one of us and has ascended like you  matt he is no kin to me he is a trier he is a copycat he ascends for selfish reasons whereas i  was merely following my destiny he will be destroyed you have the tools you have the 
none	 means  the weave is tangled before us the threads grow knotted hard to follow but yours still glows so  bright into that terrible knot  liam this thing this man is your enemy yes  matt as he is the enemy of all things  liam agreed i have come here seeking power  matt you have my blessing already  liam what of these trammels these fragments of divinity have you that in you  matt i do not know much of these trammels but that they were used but i fear that is beyond my  
none	 knowledge the knowing mistress would be the one to speak to  liam we have  matt then what do you need of me  liam we need to power trammels the dawnfather the knowing mistress have contributed to our  cause to your cause these seeds of power i had hoped you could offer the same  matt at this point you feel a finger trace across your chin from behind you feel an arm the  weight resting on your shoulder and it pulls and turns you around and as you spin you come face  to face 
none	 with the porcelain mask you are so familiar with as the hand still holds the edge of  your cheek and your shoulder am i to believe that this is not some ploy to diminish my power  and leave me vulnerable to cast me from my seat  liam i thought you knew me inside and out  matt i know you but do you know them do you think ive been welcome since i entered this  pantheon my existence is perpetually a threat to the creators if anything part of this burden  that we all face 
none	 lies on my shoulders as well why would they not think to strike at two birds  with one stone at which point you watch the feathers of her dress furl out a bit like a bird  thats hit a chill  liam well it depends on you then and how much you want this wretch taken down  matt make a persuasion check  liam 18  matt theres a long silent stare i put my faith in you my fatetouched do not forget that  and all i ask is you put all your faith in me

none	 it to make sure we should have asked for some sort of  identifying feature  laura we really should have maybe we could ask the sword  sam she said do you have any more questions  laura and we didnt but maybe if we see that sword we can be like hey do you know who kas is  and if he does then were like oh fuck  sam you want to go visit craven edge  laura im saying this quietly i dont want grog to realize were doing this he has a thing  for

none	 with something drawn in the sand with a finger some  sort of a sketch  travis may i approach  matt the head facing away from you picks up a bit you may  travis jumping and landing threepoint stance  matt slowly stands up and brushes sand from the hands not turning but just looking over the  shoulder ever so slightly at you  what brings you to the temple at this hour  travis we have urgent business what are you drawing there  matt finish your statement  travis right sorry we come with grim 
none	 tidings vecna is at large and we mean to take him down  matt i know only what ive been told we are gathering the monks for defense of the city  awaiting orders im trying to meditate on where this danger is  travis we have a theory we think he might be originating in wildemount no  laura we dont know where he is exactly stammering weve been speaking to the gods  travis you might want to talk through me im his most prized pupil  laura im going to stand next to grog while i say 
none	 this  travis in the sandpit  laura yeah im going to fly down to the sandpit and land next to grog  travis lady vexahlia great fighter very brave  laura hi  matt still hasnt turned around but seems to be listening  laura champion of pelor the dawnfather weve been speaking to the gods were taking on vecna  hopefully not alone but we need to speak with kord i know that sounds odd but grog was  hoping  laura and travis i was hoping that you would know how to contact him directly perhaps maybe 
none	 have  something that was tuned to his plane of existence potentially  matt you have drawn kords attention once directly he is aware of you should you wish to  speak that i can teach it is a long process piety meditation and learning of the history of  the storm lord himself but it can be done  laura how long of a process is this that were talking  matt you cannot rush faith  laura im not trying to rush faith im just saying that vecna has ascended to godhood we have  a limited amount 
none	 of time to take him down we need to speak with kord  matt i cannot help you  laura you cant speak to him directly  matt i can meditate and reach out perhaps  laura maybe draw his attention to us the need is dire  matt it doesnt work the way you ask kord isnt a giving god  laura hes not  matt make a religion check  laura okay yeah this is going to go so well hold up 20  matt okay you know about kord kord from what you understand is the god 
none	 of competition and  storms and chaotic nature and goodneutral territory but emphasizes contest and  travis selfreliance  matt yeah hes not the kind of god you can beseech with a word  laura maybe you can tell him theres a big fight coming call out to him get his attention  travis see if he wants box seats or something  laura yeah say he can help take down the big bad guy  travis free food and drinks  laura definitely prime tickets to a ufc fight  travis do you happen to know from all your 
none	 years of meditation what plane or where kord might  reside  matt ysgard  travis ysgard  laura east guard  matt ysgard  travis east guard  laughter  laura he is god east guard  matt ysgard  laughter  travis clears throat ysgard hmm is that on another plane  laura is that near the fields of elysium or a totally different place  matt i do not know  travis listen he is very busy right now with his meditation garden  laura right yeah so you have nothing else that you can do i 
none	 know that youre going to fight his  troops but the fact of the matter is vecna is a god if we cant find some way to speak to kord  we may not be able to save the world again  travis action now would prevent the spread of his power  matt if what you say is true im certain kord already knows we will do what we can but what  you ask is not within our ability to grant  travis fair enough you dont happen to have a bean on you do you hard no 
none	  laura powerful beans super  matt for the first time you see kord glance over his shoulder at you  laura laughs he hasnt looked at us this whole fucking time  matt no hes been back to you and looking over the shoulder he finally turns and gives a nudge  to one of the monks up top who darts off running noises a few awkward quiet minutes pass  running noises jumps down into the sand pit runs up and hands you a small satchel  travis i look inside  matt it is filled with beans 
none	  laughter  laura you have everything youve ever wanted grog congratulations  travis everybody else got one ive got a satchel just fucking name the group after me we  are out thank you  laura can i see what he was drawing in the sand while we were over there  matt make a perception check  laura 18  travis ill do it too because i was curious  matt go for it  travis dont worry about it  laughter  matt you glance over and you see one sketch that appears to be a general 
none	 overview of the city of  all the different quarters that make up the mountain and hes essentially trying to work out  defense positions within the city and preparing for some sort of siege  travis i thank you for seeing us at this late hour and i wish you luck in the defense of this  temple and this city  matt i wish i could be of more help  travis you have been  laura groon if vecna attacks here hell bring undead  matt thats all right well bring the storm  travis oh fuck

none	 of the temple  matt well as you step out of the temple and scanlan blues you all you make your way across  sam episode title the blue job  laughter  travis the multiple blue jobs  matt yeah okay as you exit the temple its late night and the bustle has calmed down a  little bit as it is the evening but you do see there are normally what are small patrol lights at  the edges of the walls you can see large fires are burning at the edges to extend eyesight  its interesting 
none	 you see wyverns in the sky you hear the familiar cries of wyverns and at first  it catches you offguard but vexahlia glancing up you can see they all have some sort of barding  on them silver and blue barding  laura oh shit its the temple of bahamut yes  matt platinum dragons they have wyvern riders here that act as air patrol during times of  intense possible warfare  travis air force got scrambled aircraft noises amazing  taliesin formation smoke  laura i really hope vasselheim stands  matt you guys make your way 
none	 back to ravens crest to the entranceway to scanlans magnificent  mansion and to the rest of your party freshly washed  travis so a question whats on the menu  taliesin beans apparently  travis now look how do you even know that  taliesin i just assumed because i know you  travis why would you only serve beans theres no meat or fish  sam its vegan here we serve a lot of beans  travis because of your daughter  sam yes  travis well shes not here can we make an exception  sam shes 
none	 always here in my heart  taliesin hopefully not in the kitchen though so were going to cook anything we like  travis i got what we needed i got myself a bean  marisha you got a shard  travis i got several shards i got a bag full of shards hold on the power might bowl you all  over  taliesin that actually might especially if not eaten with rice  travis what are you doing gasping  liam its all right i can eat anything  travis how do you feel  matt tastes like ash 
none	  liam yeah so does everything  marisha gasps we used to eat these in the fire ashari all the time these are a rare delicacy  good find grog gasps i could grow some more oh my god we can have coal bean soup all the time  at home you guys these are coal beans theyre great  travis these are not the same thing  laura there could be an actual seed of power within there  travis is there a table nearby  matt yeah youre not too far from the  travis i dump all 
none	 the beans out on the table are there any beans that look different from the  rest  matt make an investigation check  laura ill look over his shoulder and help look im going to help look  travis laughing 16 does that count  laura thats not bad  matt you actually find four beans that look a bit darker but squishier they look to maybe be a  little on the the rotten side  travis these are the beans i mean i shouldve thought kord is a fist and you put one of each  four 
none	 on the knuckles i squish each one of the beans  matt and they squish easy squishing noise  travis im not a praying man bless my gauntlet anything happen  marisha theres a little juice running down your gauntlet  travis are they glowing  laura well  marisha fermented fermented  matt a little funky  travis you know what i bet if i pray hard enough they will disappear look above you  laura and sam noises of surprise  matt make a sleightofhand check  travis hey thats not terrible laughing i got plus two 18 
none	  laughter  matt strangely scanlan and pike are impressed  sam i just rolled a two whoa that was impressive  travis yeah well the line between me and kord super tight  marisha keyleth goes behind grog and starts cleaning up the beans that he just threw  travis pike pretty good right  matt honestly kind of blown away  travis i know maybe i should get a tattoo for kord like the symbols you have for sarenrae  matt whatre you thinking for the tattoo  travis i dont know a fist  taliesin or a 
dung	 bean  travis hey dont put ideas in my head a bean  matt actually the symbol of the storm lords cool ill get it up for you and she pulls out a  piece of paper and sketches it up for you its this cool disc this dark metal disc with blue  bolts of lightning that stick out of the center  travis the storm lord symbol is the jam that is a cartoon bean  laura its a bean with a dick  travis the dick is smaller than the balls its like a parrots beak listen 
dung	 were going to stick  with the storm lord sigil  liam we are going to save the world  travis well listen i found out where kord is hes in a place called  laura and sam ysgard  marisha sure  travis are you familiar  marisha no  travis oh whyd you say sure  marisha i was just seeming intelligent  travis i do that all the time anybody have any idea where that is  sam no we can ask  travis okay who can we ask  taliesin asking the dungeon master  matt 
none	 chuckles make a religion check only if youre trained in it  liam im making a religion check jeepers  matt i just rolled for pike  travis 17 but im not trained in it  liam just a 12  taliesin im not trained in religion  matt sighs not a whole lot of information gleaned on this  travis sighs okay how did pike roll  matt pike didnt roll that great  travis fuck  laura percy with your migraine do you know what else we need to make these trammels  taliesin ive been thinking a 
none	 lot ive been trying to skirt around this information for a  bunch of reasons so ive been making a mental shopping list  matt yeah and from what you recall it seems that one the tools that were used to build them  are generally with the anvil forge its more the essence of the god that drives the trammel the  material required is pure platinum  laura gasps platinum mines  travis yeah that we buried under a mountain  laura so we know where they are  marisha do we for sure need platinum  matt 
none	 the trammels are about that long theyre giant stakes of platinum  laura we need more platinum  taliesin im attempting to do the math of how much platinum  matt i mean if you were to melt down platinum pieces each trammel would probably be close to  id say with the density and the thickness of it 500 platinum  marisha each trammel is 500 platinum  matt yeah for the thickness of it for the pure platinum structure  marisha how much do we have  laura well i didnt write exactly how much platinum we have 
none	 i transposed the platinum into  gold in my notes  matt okay  taliesin we can buy platinum go to a bank and exchange it  matt you can exchange gold for platinum  marisha wait grog you had it in your original bag of holding how much was written down on our  original bag of holding list  travis i dont know there were a bunch of digits  marisha do you not still have it written down  taliesin if he actually has the phrase a bunch of digits that would make me so happy right 
none	  now  travis you know we could always take kimas greatsword its made out of solid platinum  matt she has that sword right now  travis yeah she does im just saying  sam who was the other band of travelers who fought and lost  travis 1600 platinum  marisha we had 1600 platinum originally  travis 1619  taliesin theres part of me that doesnt want to know  marisha were going to find out  laura we could go to the bank here in vasselheim and switch out money for platinum we have enough  
none	 gold to do its 500 platinum each you said  marisha is there a place where we could buy bars  laura 5000 gold would be 500 platinum okay  matt you have to melt it down to get rid of the impurities to get the metal down to its purest  form theres a process to it that you are actually familiar with  travis im familiar with it all of a sudden so because we have these shards right these magical  beans if we lose do we effectively kill all the gods whose shards we have  
none	 taliesin we depower them so theyll be weak when they go against vecna  travis yeah thats a lot of responsibility i was not aware of  laura well we need to not lose theyre still diminished if we do defeat vecna that part of  them is forever chaining him  marisha if we fail he could be coming after them they have no line of defense  travis worst scenario possible cool good to know  matt good news is you do know that the divine gate works both ways he could not travel into  their realms 
none	 they could not travel into that however it prevents them from intervening  directly on his dominion over the prime material plane  liam and as far as we know this other group did not have the help of gods  laura right as far as we know  liam as far as we know unless they went to all of the other gods we have not met  taliesin its not like we cant look in on anyone that we need to really quickly im feeling the  urge  laura do you know who it could be  
none	 liam we might want to check and see if allura gilmore kima all our buddies are okay kash  zahra  taliesin my question is does it matter at the moment  laura of course it matters dear  taliesin does it does it just make us panic  laura at least wed know if he raised them up like he said he did if well be fighting undead  gilmore and undead allura  taliesin all right point made point very well made lets start with  marisha i have a few scrys that i want to do anyway 
none	  laura can we scry through this dimension  marisha nope ive got to pop out  travis shouldnt you rest first  taliesin no finish this first  liam what do you need  marisha im just wondering if i do any type of large magic if itll alert him hey what  happened to that skull that we got in brimscythes basement  taliesin with the gem  marisha the gem in the eye  laura funny you should ask  marisha remember we thought it might be connected  taliesin it had a gem in one eye 
none	 if i recall  travis yeah a green emerald gem in one socket you dicks  sam where is it  laura allura has it  marisha we gave it to allura  travis what  laura allura has it  travis no its in percys workshop  laura sure and allura came down and saw it no i gave it to allura  marisha i wonder if its spying on everything  laura im sorry grog i gave you your deck of cards back the skull was very dangerous and at  the time it seemed like the right 
none	 thing to do im sorry im sorry look we just went and got a  bunch of beans for you  travis thats true  liam and also buddy we might be dead in a week you dont want to hold on to that kind of shit  taliesin we may be going to get the skull back  marisha well yeah we could get the skull back because i was just going through my notes my old  diary of everything that weve been through  taliesin it literally has a leaf on it oh my god  marisha 
none	 i have four diaries of everything weve been through  taliesin ive read them  sam ugh what kind of dumb character keeps a diary  marisha it said evil skull in brimscythes 121 we found an evil skull in brimscythes  house it may be connected to craven edge and i put stars next to it  taliesin did you put stars next to it because it was important or did you just put stars next to it  marisha i dont know thats just what i wrote down a year and a half ago  travis i mean 
none	 do you need me to drop my scholastic knowledge on this shit because i will  it talked to me and it was like if you free me ill give you a wish  marisha the skull  travis yeah why do you think i was trying to break that shit  laura i dont believe if youd freed it you wouldve gotten a wish i think you wouldve  fought something  travis do you know for sure  laura no  travis then what are we talking about  taliesin lets find out whats going on with the 
none	 skull  liam yeah we are in final days here  taliesin yeah lets give ourselves  sam what are we doing  taliesin were going to try and take 48 hours to get as much done as humanly possible  laura we need to scry on the fucking friends we need to check in on that skull maybe  and you need to maybe open up the plane to the dread emperor and see about the craven edge  marisha what now  liam the gods must be crazy  taliesin part two  sam thats low priority  
none	 laura is it  sam i dont think thats the thing  laura what if that weapon is super good against vecna  sam just because its a sword  marisha okay wait did she say we needed the sword also i think the knight guy that you  fought that was super awful was the bloody  liam kas  laura no kas is destroyed he turned to ash he fought vecna and was turned to ash  sam did the knight have a sword  travis he did a giant blade that emitted shadow  sam maybe that 
none	 was the sword  marisha but wasnt he brought back kas the bloodyhanded right oh wait he fought  laura he fought against vecna they destroyed each other its the reason vecna was destroyed to  begin with  marisha but maybe he brought kas back and that was the death knight we fought  sam the world is full of mysteries  taliesin one of which is whether or not our friends are alive  marisha all right im going to step outside and scry on allura first  liam and im going to nothing im just going to 
none	 stand and walk out front  matt so youre scrying first  marisha allura  matt okay so you step out into the center of the structure  laura whispering please please please please please  marisha wait is anybody around nothings weird and out of the ordinary  matt youre in the ravens crest  marisha okay just want to make sure people just punkd us at spriggs cabin  sam were inside a church  marisha doesnt mean assassins cant get inside a church  laura just go just scry  marisha okay im going  matt okay 
none	 so laughs as you sit and focus concentrate you draw out the various arcane  glyphs on the ground and focus on allura your vision expands into the sky whoosh rushing  through the night air and the spattering of clouds that have amassed over vasselheim it fires  through the stratosphere dives down into the center of emon into a bedroom she is currently  at a desk and is feverishly writing on parchment her hair is tousled a bit and she has a thick robe  over her shoulders and you can see she finishes writing something rolls 
none	 it up seals it sets it  into a pile thinks a second casts a spell absentmindedly it flickers off and vanishes she  goes back to writing the door opens and you watch as kima comes in brings a little tray with some  hot tea and sets it down beside her rubs her shoulder a bit and allura looks back at her and  nods you guys are the worst  laughter  matt allura puts her face in her hands for a second rubs her temples she looks tired kima  leaves the room and allura is 
none	 left there to  think for a second looks out the window of her  tower then goes back to her writing  marisha okay  sam was she covered with blood  marisha no shes fine shes safe in emon so is kima theyre both safe  sam skull was next on the list  laura well allura has the skull do we have any way to talk to her  sam no  marisha okay should i do gilmore next is that necessary  laura can you scry on the object no  marisha i can scry on 
none	 an object right  matt an object or a person  marisha should i do the skull  liam is it a safe assumption that skull is with her shes pretty fucking badass  marisha i mean it might just be a lich phylactery or something  sam who else would have gone into battle against vecna  liam well if it is a lich phylactery that would be something we would smash to bits  sam couldve been kash  taliesin couldve been tary  sam who oh that fancy fellow  laura oh my god can you scry 
none	 on tary what if he came searching for us  marisha but tary was still in  taliesin just pick a city lets just keep looking at people in various cities  marisha tary we would feel it  liam keyleth just spit out an idea if that skull which looked like his fucking head weve  dealt with a lich before if it has even a chance of being a vessel for his life force even a  chance wouldnt we want to not use it but destroy it  matt i will impart the information that you did 
none	 discover that the skull was the skull of a  githyanki  liam oh that was from 300 hours ago i misspoke  matt theyre a type of people a race of people that traverse the astral sea  liam but it has one eye  matt oh it has two eyes  liam emerald in one eye  matt yeah well the skull shape was alien and was elongated almost elven  liam that was hundreds of hours ago  matt i wanted to save you circularly arguing about something without some information  sam oh well still circularly 
none	 argue about something  matt oh im sure you will  liam yeah this clusterfucks not over  sam its been a halfhour of fuckery right here  taliesin a little bit of hemming a little bit of hawing  travis wait a minute arent we forgetting about one undead thing didnt we want to go back and  talk to delilahs body  taliesin oh yeah were going to have that conversation  liam is she in your bag  taliesin thats right  marisha shes in the bag of colding  laura she might be in the colding
