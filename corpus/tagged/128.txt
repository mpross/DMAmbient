i think  matt this is a terrible idea  travis its a great idea  matt anyway without further ado i think that concludes our announcements and as such let us  dive into tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello everyone and welcome back so where we left off last time vox machina having finally  encountered the undying king returned in physical form in the shadowfell did battle and fled quite  unprepared for that venture and gathered some /none/ tidbits of information about what vecnas plans  may be upon returning and discovering that your disintegrated vax has returned through some deal  he made with his patron the raven queen after disintegrating you decided to go ahead and try  and gather more information about this and beseech some of the higher powers within exandria pike  talked to sarenrae and was given the invitation to come visit her in elysium on the island of  renewal and upon gathering your materials and causing a mess in vasselheim you got together and  went to meet this fantastic /none/ everlight on her island you spoke with her she gathered some  information from you as vecna seemed to be blocking at least the influence and vision from a  lot of the deities and then gave her blessing unto pike transferring you over to one of the  other gods that lives among the blessed fields of elysium pelor the dawnfather  you then walked through the orchards that led to the fortress of the sun where he resides spoke  with some of the guardians there and were led into the center of the citadel where you met /none/ in  the central throne room under the zenith tower pelor himself upon exchanging information you  spoke of your need to gather the favor of certain gods in the battles to come and were given a  challenge to step up to plate vexahlia you accepted the challenge and racing to the top of  the tower the zenith before the fires could be extinguished in the brazier that awaited you you  threw yourself into the fire and upon the party speaking on what it was that made vexahlia such  an important member of not just your /none/ team but your family and gave you strength she was imbued  with a blessing of the dawnfather himself after which we left off as you exited the front of the  fortress of the sun stepped into the central glade that marks the center of the  seemingly endless orchards that surround this region and vox machina what would you like to  do  travis eat all of the fruit  laura no  travis it was really good it was just fruit by the way like i said  sam were still in heaven right now  /none/ laura were still in elysium  taliesin its not quite heaven  travis are there any other gods here that we should curry favor with for of  laura are there any more gods here not that we know of  sam we forgot to ask  travis did we  laura yeah i dont think ioun is here  matt youre looking at the series of the sun tree cousins one of which youve met scattered  amongst this glade surrounding the central citadel  marisha what a douche  sam no other people guards nothing  matt you /none/ have the guards behind you the large planetar and deva entities that stand there  armored in their golden plate after ushering you out are standing guard  laura maybe we can ask them  sam sure ill go up to one and say hello there big fellow  matt standing a full ten feet taller than you practically the wings slightly bent the large  planar entity kneels down hello  sam hello vacation scanlan here couple questions by the way was he one of the ones who  fought in there  matt make a perception check  /none/ sam oh do they all look alike 17 plus one  matt hard to tell you didnt pay a lot of attention  sam okay hey just wondering a few questions a how does one get out of here is there a door  to another plane  matt i imagine the same way you came in  sam a god brought us here all right cool number two are there any other like your  dawnfather around here any other gods in the area  matt across elysium there are two deities that call it home the dawnfather and /none/ the everlight  sam so we covered our bases out of curiosity what are you called  matt he looks very closely and you get sense that part of its nature is scanning through you  its getting a sense and a read of you as an individual and it says no one you need to worry  about stands up and then takes two steps back heavy footfalls into place and looks straight  ahead  marisha scanlan you should remember that line thats a good one  sam yeah i already forgot it im too intimidated was it /none/ no one or something i dont  know well good speaking to you  matt still looks out doesnt respond  sam well how do we get out of here can she take us home  marisha yeah  liam she does on the daily  sam i know but i dont know they talked about some sort of a gate that keeps the gods out and  the bad gods in  matt to remind you of what happened last time there was talking about possibly or at least  there was the trammel the prime trammels that were /none/ used previously to seal the chained oblivion  tharizdun and that the orchestrator the designer of those was ioun the knowing goddess ioun  however has sealed herself away being a wounded god long recovering and the only information  that pelor has of where she hid herself the key essentially is not an object but a person youre  seeking an individual of which you were given a solar light map of a single small home in a forest  ravine not far from a place that youve noticed was near the pools of wittebak which is in the /none/  cliffkeep mountains  sam yeah but there was also a mention of some divine gate that keeps people from  matt well the divine gate is a known existing entity its essentially a large gate that  prevents the gods from returning to the prime material plane  liam its like a metaphysical screen door that keeps flies out  laura so the gods cant get in and out  sam sure sure  marisha yeah the prime trammel which we now have to get  laura we have to get near the the cliffkeep range near the pools /none/ of wittebak is where we  need to go  marisha and the cliffkeep is not too far from whitestone  matt cliffkeep mountains go across a lot of the northern side of taldorei from what youre  familiar with like were talking kraghammer to gatshadow to the jorenn village theres a lot of  things its like a big horizontal mountain range that caps the top part of the continent  marisha do i recognize the city that i can get us to thats close  matt fort daxio or kraghammer  sam havent been to kraghammer for a /none/ while although daxio might be worth a check  taliesin whats closest to the pools  matt probably terrah or the pools of wittebak those are the two that are closest  laura what is terrah  marisha my home  matt terrahs not your home  marisha sorry sorry terrah is the earth ashari  sam my other home summer home  matt the home away from home  liam can you also remind me where my vecdar made me feel vecna where on the prime material  plane  matt yes oh where  liam yeah we talked /none/ about it but i cant remember  matt you did yes it seemed to be hundreds of miles northwest of vasselheim you didnt sense  any movement but you knew the general direction and distance  liam and that was yesterday  matt correct  laura teacher  matt yes laura  laura i was excited the last game and somehow have misplaced my pelor champion piece of paper  liam oh she doesnt get to have it now thats how that works  laura i dont know how it happened its not with my stuffs  matt thats okay /none/ i remember what it does and if you decide to use it  laura youll tell me okay  matt i wont tell you you tell me you want to use it  laura oh shit okay im sorry i had it and its not here  taliesin its weird how hes so nice and yet it still feels like you are in so much trouble  laura im in a lot of trouble you guys  liam hes calm but indifferent like the dawnfather  matt all right so what would you like to do  travis yeah what /none/ would we like to do  marisha should we go to terrah check in with them i guess while were there  taliesin seems prudent  marisha and talk to patice  travis yeah  marisha all right we ready to go  taliesin im very ready to go this is lovely and everything but ive had my fill  marisha i will burn my 8thlevel spell slot to plane shift us to terrah  matt to terrah all righty  marisha mind the gap  taliesin what gap  marisha dont worry about it  travis no effects from /none/ eating that fruit right  matt no you didnt sense any effects from that fruit at the moment  travis didnt remove a curse or anything  matt no you didnt nothing really caught you up to speed in that  laura are we by those fruit trees again  matt there are no fruitbearing trees directly near you the sun trees are around you further in  they do yes all righty bringing up my notes on terrah since thats where youre going  marisha yeah i should probably  laura im so confused about the order of things /none/ if we go to ioun and we dont have everything we  need for this prime trammel are we fucked i know we need godly power in order to imbue them right  or something  liam either here or soon we need to sit and work this out  sam what do we need to bring into the trammel  laura well pelor gave me this snap snap snap zip this its a stone and its supposed to be  strong enough to  liam power the trammel  laura part of it not all of it  marisha /none/ we need to collect more though right we have to get like eight or something  sam wait it said that  matt you werent given any indication as to how many you needed  laura but it did seem like this is not enough  marisha oh no wait ioun was healing for eight centuries thats where i got that number sorry  travis i could do it too five five stones of power  matt all right so as you complete your spell keyleth you step through the base of the nearest  tree possibly the same one /none/ you spoke with earlier if you want to be a dick about it  marisha oh yeah lets walk through that asshole that sounds worse for us but fuck it  matt all right you aggressively stampede through the center of this one tree and emerge on the  other side from one of the surrounding trees on the terrah village there are a number of these  pseudopetrified or driedout largetrunk trees that seem to have slowly died off from the heavy  tectonic shifts and small quakes that happen in this area that have made a lot of /none/ the land unable  to support large forms of plant life or at least the trees that used to exist here so you step out and  emerge from the exterior of the village as it domes down into this small crater that you recall  seeing before where most of the village inhabits the central portion and the village is there before  you  marisha what were the shard things called again  matt the shard things  marisha the things we need to collect  matt there wasnt really a name for them more than theyre small /none/ pieces of essence of the  deity  marisha so we need pieces of god  liam does the little seed of light given to my sister look anything like the little seed that  scanlan and vax saw from riding the shadow creature in the sky  matt no in a sense that its a small source of power of some kind but what you saw there was  maybe about that large on the platform what she has is bead size  laura is it this size or this size  matt comparable to each so you stand /dung/ outside of terrah what are you doing  sam what time of day is it how tired are we  matt based on when you left it would still be probably well you were over in vasselheim which  means its getting dark actually id say with the way the sun has passed through the sky now  youve just gotten past dusk theres still light in the sky but its going from oranges to  purples to dark blues on the horizon and you can see hints of firelight torchlight and candlelight  from within the actual city below /none/  sam well what are we going to need on this trip maybe we should get whatever supplies we need is  it far are we going to become gas  travis are we going underground  marisha oh to terrah  sam no wee in terrah but the next day were going to the  taliesin to the pools  marisha do we want to stay the night here then i cant mist us right now im tapped out camp  here  laura vax can you sense vecna is he still in the same place  liam i /none/ can sense him  matt you can sense him he is from your current location thousands of miles from you  laura oh hard to tell then  liam hes still really shitty though  matt yeah very heavy westnorthwest direction from you currently  sam well sleep do we need to get any intel on where these pools are do we need anything  laura we should maybe talk to the people of terrah its not that late  marisha yeah lets go they have a spare room for us  travis are you the leader of all the /none/ people  marisha im the leader of the air ashari and the voice of the tempest  travis is that a yes or a no you dont have to fucking brag  marisha no theres four of us and im one of the four  sam do you know the one who lives here  marisha i do  sam then lets go see him or her or they  marisha no we can just go like i was saying five minutes ago lets just go  matt all right so as you walk down into the village a number /dung/ of the guardians step out  quickly seeing an approaching party however recognizing keyleth and her station immediately  turn into an escort that leads you to the center portion of the village  marisha i request patice  matt quickly enough they go and retrieve patice you see the elderly form of the leader  youve met before step out the graying hair the weathered dark skin tones the long greens and  brown leathers that drape off showing hints of the knees and lower feet the large walking staff  that he carries at his side as he /none/ approaches and the headdress that seems to be a combination of  thick twines and shale shards that have been woven in steps forward keyleth an unexpected visit  most definitely  marisha kaitiaki  matt kaitiaki  marisha patice i am so sorry for the late intrusion weve just gotten back from the plane  of elysium so were a little tired yeah were fighting a god right now well more of like a  demigod so have you heard of vecna sorry im probably getting ahead of myself do you have any  food lets talk over dinner /none/  matt we have food yes you are guests of terrah please we will provide whatever you  require come provide them a meal and he puts his hand out and they run off quickly  taliesin i like that people just feed us we show up and theres food  sam youve been used to that your whole life  taliesin not at home  sam i have to sing for dinner you just say  taliesin have you ever tried not singing for dinner  sam maybe ill get more food  taliesin you might  liam you /none/ did have one yearish where you were on the skids you did your prince and the pauper bit  for a little bit  taliesin its a big vague but yes i was on a boat for quite a while  travis oh my god can we eat food  laughter  matt and quick as that you guys make your way down its a modest meal but its a meal  nonetheless mostly hunted creatures of the local mountainside some dried beets and root  marisha we always try to source locally  taliesin charmingly provincial  matt laughs /none/  laura keyleth perhaps you should let your people know that the world is in danger  marisha so the worlds in danger as she said  sam the waiter is like what  liam runs out the door  marisha aw shit i just induced panic  matt patice whos sat down with you says quickly we have been made aware via the other  ashari that there is some danger possibly coming we are awaiting word of what to do other than keep  ourselves in a defensive position we have to guard the rift of course but /none/ should there be a  call to action well do what we can im unfamiliar with this vecna but whatever you plan  please be careful  marisha sighs okay more than anything i think i would want you all to be relief for the  surrounding area and surrounding villages if anything disastrous were to happen i know you  have to guard the rift and that is insanely important and especially right now with someone  like vecna who could potentially abuse that but if anything were to happen i dont know if you  could house extra /none/ people during a disaster  matt we are quite good at assembling makeshift and temporary lodging the rock is our friend if  you will  marisha yeah thats more i think what we would need  matt of course of course not a worry  marisha currently vecna is just north of vasselheim close to pyrah  matt have you asked pyrah for aid as well  marisha theyve also been put on alert but we have not personally been there yet since this has  happened  matt well good theyre closer but were happy to help if /none/ we can  marisha yeah thank you  laura things are happening very quickly we just happened here first  matt were happy to help where are you off to  sam the pools of wittebak  matt what brings you towards the pools of wittebak  sam you know this place  matt it is a series of poisoned wells and hulking stupid giants  sam hulking stupid giants  laura giants at the pools  matt yes  laura i thought it was something about gnomes there  matt it was once  sam they grew  laughter /none/  laura is that something you can do scanlan  sam i dont know laughs  matt theyre geothermic large puddles across the mountainside various minerals being lifted up  from the deep waters beneath the mountain heated bubbling boiling steaming but the giants moved  in hundreds of years ago stomped around and ended up filling the entire subterranean gnomish  city of wittebak with fumes and poison killed most of them and the rest fled to kraghammer  liam do you all ever broach the area or do you just stay clear of it  matt best to /none/ avoid we have our own business to deal with and its 100 miles from here its not  much of an issue  taliesin and the pools are naturally poisonous  matt well some are toxic some are not but since the giants moved in and ruptured some of the  natural formations some of them have grown toxic or acidic yes  marisha do you know if people still try to live there were looking for someone  matt if they are theyre foolish  marisha okay  taliesin thats our kind of people  laura maybe the person /none/ were looking for is a giant  marisha maybe  sam do you know what type of giant weve seen a few types of giants do you know their make and  model  matt the dumbest hill giants  laura hill giants  travis yeah  matt easy to outsmart difficult to outrun theyll eat anything even small little gnomes  laura seems like they ate a lot of them  sam laughing i guess so  laura pasty i have a question do you know anything about ioun  matt i know of the name  laura but /none/ not much  matt were not the most devoted people  laura i know  marisha i saw that  laughter  matt i cant imagine id have any information you wouldnt  laura okay just checking  matt my apologies  laura this food is really good  matt yes enjoy your meal and he gets up and walks away  taliesin he was so officious  laura i thought we were walking into a fucking lake with gnomes living there i didnt realize we  were going to fight giants  travis this got so much better all /none/ of a sudden  taliesin if it were easy it really wouldnt be us would it  marisha so the question is is there actually someone of some minor intelligence living there  that is this magical key or did that person get eaten by a giant  taliesin i cannot believe im about to say this im inclined to believe the god theyre in the  position where trying to trick us out of leaving is not necessary they couldve just told us to  leave and be done with it that information just wouldnt suit them i dont /none/ think  marisha im not saying its bad information im just wondering who the key is  laura its possible the key is now inside of a giants stomach in which case it still would  be inside of someone just a different someone  marisha yeah maybe theyre still living inside maybe its like a moby dick situation  matt you do recall the map that was shown to you by the dawnfather pelor it was adjacent to the  pools not actually in the pools of wittebak it was within a forest and was a home  laura /none/ oh i remember it now it was a home inside oh i drew a little map of it yep thats  it yes its adjacent to the pools but theres a home in a forest did you like it thats what my  map was  marisha can we theoretically just mist over everywhere  laura i mean and look out for a home in the forest well have to fly pretty low im assuming  the home is going to be covered by treetop  travis we never travel traditionally anymore im just saying i miss the romantic aspects /none/ of  traveling the countryside its like fast forward immediate gratification fucking you know  sam the dawnfather said we must hurry or else the world will end  laura its very far we could misty step to the forest and then walk in the forest  travis why are you fucking talking to me like im a child  laura no reason darling  travis okay that would okay  laughter  liam once this is all done grog you and i will go on a long trek together  travis yeah yeah i dig that  laura dont /dung/ be dark and creepy and make it sound like youre being nice i know youre being dark  and creepy right now  travis oh hey dont get after my camping partner like that all right shit chill  liam cant predict this one  travis no marshmallows for this witch  marisha it is a little weird to be making promises though  taliesin well on that chipper little side note i think we should turn in for the evening  sam yes do we have lodging  matt lodging is provided for you they have a number of /town/ various guest tents and small buildings  that provide you with space not the highest of quality of places youve slept in probably and  if you wanted to provide your mansion instead youre welcome to but ample food quiet sleep  its a comfortable evenings rest you all find yourselves through the evening as you sleep and  having this being the first time many of you have slept in terrah it takes you a while there is  just a general low hum or vibration to the ground that you sleep on you get the sense its  /none/ probably proximity to the rift but there is this slow perpetual rumbling its like a weird low  rumble like a heavy bass sound that never seems to dissipate that you hadnt noticed until you  were trying to quietly sleep but its not offputting and within ten or 15 minutes it  actually almost helps to lull you to rest you all come to in the morning gather your supplies and  are preparing for the next leg of your journey what do you wish to do  travis could i attune either before i go to sleep or /town/ when i wake up to the dwarven thrower  instead of the bloodaxe  matt you may all right any other attunements anyone wishes to  liam ill set the deathwalkers ward to acid  matt all right to acid boom  laura before everyone else gets up can i go find where vax is sleeping  matt you may  laura this is a tent what do i do do i knock do i shake it im not sure scratch  matt theyre lodging made from large pieces of shale and rock jammed into a somewhat triangular  pattern /town/ to form an earth yurt if you will  laura oi vax are you naked  liam yes  laura put some clothes on then jesus keyleth sorry  marisha keyleth opens the shamble door first with a little earth movement im dressed yeah im  not like that  laura you dont sleep naked  marisha im going to go get coffee  laura okay  matt laughs keyleth darts off in the distance and the two of you are left within the tent  laura are you decent  liam yes  laura im coming in  liam /none/ im still naked  laura ugh come on so fucking weird groans i turn my back to him  liam i start putting on the rest of my armor  matt okay laughs  laura can i ask you a question well im going to  liam of course you can  laura i look down at my feet why didnt you ever try to take these back  liam well theyre going to be yours anyway  laura oh jesus you know the only reason i do things is that i take great joy in irritating  you if /none/ you dont show irritation it makes it not worth it sighs can i turn around now im  turning around  liam i am covered  laura good why are you so calm youre so calm and confident now its weird  liam i mean im on bonus time  laura is he still cold  matt his skin is colder than a warm body yes  liam but im not bobby drake right  laura whats his heartbeat like  matt very slow heartbeat  laura groans jeez  taliesin wow way to hang onto that one matt  /none/ liam but look slashing noise i mean look  laura is there blood  matt yeah he bleeds and its a pretty open wound you watch as the wound slowly seals itself  up  laura gasping no fucking way  liam oh i didnt know it did that  laughter  laura thats really cool  liam thank you  laura wow  liam i dont know this is the dumbest conversation this is bonus time i shouldnt be  here it was the long sleep or come back and help  laura so she gave you the option /none/ and then you came back and now youre what super super  halfelf  liam well im just following through on a promise made  laura and we defeat vecna and youre done youre gone thats it instant is it like we kill him  and youre gone that second or is it like we kill him and youre here for another week or until  the raven queen realizes that youre still here  liam there isnt really a handbook  laura she didnt tell you  liam when vecna is destroyed she will call me back to where /none/ i would be right now i expect  everyone keyleth and i have barely spoken i expect everyone to be sad but i wish you wouldnt  be so sad not exorbitantly so because i  laura exorbitant thats a good word  liam i read not as much as some but i read this is the path that i have chosen for myself and  i did it based out of desperation at first but everyone dies  laura i know  liam and i think our group has become a little spoiled were not your ordinary group of /none/ idiots we  have blessings  laura were blessed idiots  liam blessed idiots yes and i know that weve gotten used to feeling like we can overcome losing  anyone but your average farmer or seamstress doesnt come back and everybody dies and all  that matters is what you do with what you have and i have done a lot and ive taken great pride  watching all that you have done and i have good friends and i have fallen in love more than most  ive had  laura yeah after you die do you stand /none/ by her side  liam that i dont really know i imagine shell keep me close  laura do you like her now  liam yes  laura thats good  liam shes necessary and shes of use and i like that  laura she brought you back to us for a while i like her too anyway do you want the fucking  boots back fuck yeah sure yes fine thats fine i wanted to give them back so there you go  im glad you asked for them back  liam i dont have a lot of time /none/ they really are my favorite thing  laura i know  liam physical thing  laura just make sure you write it down somewhere that after you go back to the raven  queen that your sister is your favorite in the universe  liam dear every stitch on my body is yours when i am gone  laura i dont want every stitch none of its worth you leaving  liam i slide my feet into the shoes and i wiggle my toes around oh im sorry i also have a  confession to make  laura what  /none/ liam i dont exactly have your shoes anymore  laura what  liam i think that i left them in the feywild  laura the feywild  liam yeah i think i dropped them into a bog they didnt fit me  laura you are a motherfucker you couldnt have just put them in the bag of holding  liam im still me  laura great wonderful i like being barefoot  liam you have very cute small feet that fit in the boots that you gave me that did not fit my feet  laura thats great  liam /none/ theres probably shoes here  laura probably all right  liam i pull out her shoes and i put them down  laura well at least theres that  matt got your shoes back keyleth returns with some coffee the rest of you come to  consciousness and the morning sun is now blaring down over the cliffkeep its a strangely clear  sky for the north while a lot of it is relatively cold usually youre used to seeing the snow  capped mountaintops oh you found it there you go  taliesin it was with you the whole /none/ time  liam must have been inside your shoes  laura oh my gosh i put it in the safe place and i didnt realize it  travis thank you chat  laura did they really know where i put it  travis yeah they know where your shit is  sam the chat knew where you put your stuff  travis its in the page in front of your blue divider  sam no way  laura wow thank you thank you guys  liam how many fingers am i holding up  matt so bringing it back in /none/ guys  sam yes we have a guest  matt yes at some point so what do you guys want to do  sam set off for the pools of hatabah  laughter  taliesin for the forest near the pools of  sam the adjacent to the pools of hatafah  travis we didnt want to bring any extra muscle with us do we from these peeps oh wait were  misting a long ways away never mind sorry forget it  liam grog you are our extra muscle  travis see high five up top  liam im /none/ not dead  travis his hands cold  matt so youre traversing via your wind walk  marisha i guess are we wind walking there  laura mispronouncing wind  marisha mispronouncing wind walk wind walking  liam mispronouncing wil wheaton  sam hey before we leave real quick kiki  marisha yes  sam can you send messages or anything  marisha no man we have been through this with our entire group so many times  sam its just youre so powerful  marisha thank you  sam lets go  marisha what do you need  sam /none/ i would send a letter but itll take weeks so forget it well be somewhere close to  somewhere with magic soon  marisha we can leave it in the hands of the ashari see if they can find somebody  sam you trust these folks  marisha yeah theyre all right  taliesin and marisha theyre not the worst  sam all right ill scribble a little note and say well no theres no way they can get it to  its too far its too far  taliesin i was really excited to see your face when you /none/ handed it to them and theyre like what  are we supposed to do with this  sam here ill show you grog  travis write it out bitch  sam i write a sphincter says what  travis a as good message thats a big word at the front  laura you could have gotten the last one though  travis what  sam yes  matt pike taps you on the shoulder and is like ill teach you that later  taliesin thank you for the ashley johnson simulator that was weirdly comforting  matt curse you blindspot /none/  travis yeah are we misting  sam yeah lets do it  laura should we eat a feast first or should we save that  taliesin lets save that  laura okay i dont know what were going to find  matt thats up to you guys so preparations being done you gather your materials keyleth completes  the wind walk spell and you all feel yourselves grow slightly lighter on your toes you  concentrate over the minute transformation you turn into your mist forms and take off in what  direction  marisha towards the falafel pools /none/  sam we wrote it down  taliesin falafel pool is actually really tasty  travis pools of wittebak  laura yeah towards the mountains  sam he said which direction he did not say where are you going he said which direction  laura we got to look at our map  marisha we have it on the map  laura we have a map  matt okay well you have terrah locked down the pools of wittebak would not be on your specific map  that you acquired earlier you can ask around within terrah within a brief /none/ time and figure it  out somewhere between 100 and 120 miles and he points in a specific direction you mark the suns  traveling and where certain landmarks are  marisha i quickly do the math of how fast i can travel and be like okay it shouldnt take long  matt its an eastward direction from where you are  taliesin you did actually legitimately point east too which makes that even better  matt thats weird  taliesin yeah that is weird  matt im putting points in my nature skill or survival i guess anyway too /none/ many editions in my  head laughs as you all take off into the morning sky you begin to rocket over and youre  hitting jets of wind that are beginning to find their way over the mountain ranges and you get  blown a little offcourse but you maintain concentration as best you can in that direction  who is leading this venture  sam ive been there no i knew of it right  matt you knew of it yeah  sam but i dont know exactly where  laura after listening to everybody ill lead the way /none/ that way i can keep an eye out for the  forest next too and the house and all the things were looking for i got a good look at the  map that pelor held up in front of us as well  matt right okay cool i need you to go ahead and make a survival check actually for this im  gonna say yeah because it would be tracking in the wilderness so survival  laura survival great any advantage on that  sam wilderness is your favored terrain  matt its mountains technically  laura thats /none/ also my favored  matt then yeah roll again  travis because that was a one  laura oh so much better 28  matt okay thatll do it your speed is tremendous when in this form so what would have  been an extended trek on foot over a series of days it takes you mere hours to eventually get to  a point where you crest one heavy peak on the opposite side you can see down the cliffside the  edge reaches a slight precipice and there you can see what looks to be for a mile /none/ or so a cluster of  dozens and dozens of pools of water of different sizes all jammed together in a geothermic  cluster where you can see bright greens that move to a deep orangemaroon at the edges from the  various mineral deposits that have collected over hundreds and hundreds of years you can see large  columns of smoke and steam of different chemical colors rising out of various large pools and at a  glance down you can see a number of shapes a number of hulking humanoid shapes somewhere in  the neighborhood of 40 /none/ to 50 or so scattered at different pools moving in small clusters or  gangs some of them are jumping in cannonballing and swimming through the actual pools some of  them are lounging around and lying some of them appear to be returning dragging things from the  nearby forest on the eastern side of the bank  marisha this is a vacation spot whats that water park nearby  laura wet n wild  matt essentially for a few hundred years you get the sense that the pools of wittebak have been  a hill giant water park /none/ you can see these large mounds of mud and scrap wood and things that have  been built into these large hill giant domiciles onto the side of the mountain not far from the  pools its become a definite hill giant wandering zone so do you guys continue over the pools down  towards the nearby forest ridge  laura yeah past the pools  matt all righty you come to the forest ridge and you can see its not thick forest the ravine  comes down off the precipice where the pools are you get a few hundred /none/ id say actually more  than that a thousand or more feet away from that precipice before plants even begin to grow it  looks like whatever toxic chemicals have burbled up in some of these pools have made a lot of the  ground there unable to give any forest life or sustain any large trees as soon as the forest  begins its a dense little pocket maybe a mile and a half two miles across thats what youve  got what do you guys want to do  laura oh man i should try to track any /none/ footprints in there and see if theres something  around the edges maybe that lead back to shit i dont fucking know its only a couple of  miles  matt if you guys begin to do a loopover whos doing a quick pass over the patch of forest all  right make a perception check  laura its the forest do i get advantage on that one perception what is that 21 21  taliesin 12  matt okay glancing over you dont see any major glades or clearings there doesnt appear to be  any sign of bastions /none/ of civilization or any sort of logging going on theres no areas where trees  have been cut or cleared its a featureless forest top from what you can see  laura can we fly down lower to where were in between the trees  matt you can go down into the forest if youd like all right whos going into the forest  then  marisha ill go  laura ill go all of us  matt so with pike following suit you guys all swoop down through the boughs of the trees and  into the center of /none/ the forest itself within there its not a super thick canopy its not as  heavy as the feywild or some of the recent forests that cluster around vasselheim there are breaks  in the canopy where you can see the sunbeams come through from the morning sun thats rising up  higher and higher in the sky as youve traveled the mist has burned away in this area so its a nice  warm forest glancing about there is a lot of life in here you can see signs of squirrels you  rush by what was a family /none/ of wolverinelike creatures that are rustling by as soon as the  wind scoots in and your mist forms come rocketing past they all scatter and run off into the  shadows theres a lot of forest ground here to cover for you to really super track with  advantage youd have to go into human form id give you a regular roll if you want to try and  track in your mist form  laura not so much tracking right now just a loose passover as were going looking for any  kind of hunting traps or trails /none/ signs of life of things that have been traversed a lot  matt id say make an investigation check  laura 27  matt 27 begin coasting through tree after tree through small tiny bits of clearing that  immediately come into large clusters of trunks and knotted branches that all merge and cluster at  different intersections after about 20 or so minutes of this trying to do a large spiral  around the forest inward out of the corner of your eye vexahlia you glance over and see a  quick glimpse of something that appears to be /none/ more structured you look back and rush over and there  you see amongst the trees what appears to be a humblelooking twostory home you see a small  balcony built on the second floor that goes over one of the larger rooms in the bottom floor its  not huge by any means and is hidden by a lot of the local brush and trees there cant get a lot  more detail at this distance though  laura okay we land i land  marisha i follow  laura and behind a tree im going to take form /none/  matt you take your form okay so all of you land and follow vex  sam yeah  matt you all take a minute to go back to your physical forms you glance over and there it is  standing before you its very shaded in this part of the forest you can see a little bit of what  looks to be interior light very faint  travis like a normal personsized dwelling  matt make a perception check  travis natural 20  laura yay  matt it would be a little small for you grog but /none/ you could walk in it proportionally it looks  maybe like it was built for a little bit of a smaller person  travis okay  liam i want to start eyeballing the ground of the house for any kinds of traps set out is that  investigation yeah  matt that is investigation  liam 18  matt 18 okay so you guys begin to slowly  travis wait before we do there are no random nudist giants that have run over in this area  right theres nobody sees us over here taking off  taliesin youre worried /none/ about giants streaking  travis not particularly  taliesin that was very specific  travis well yeah have you ever seen a giant naked youll never forget it  taliesin i might i dont know  sam are you suggesting we set up a perimeter  travis yeah i mean its a tiny house i dont really want to go in there i like having exits i  fit through  laura i dont want whoever it is to think that we threaten them in any way but then if they  threaten us i wouldnt want them to attack /none/ us either  travis yeah ill just knock the house down from the outside  taliesin lets keep this structure standing for now  travis ill stay outside  sam are we knocking properly or are we just going to invisibility in and see whos in there  laura i feel like maybe knock properly  taliesin if you think long and hard about it its not like manners have failed us very often  laura yeah but do keep an eye out for traps or anything weird on the way up  marisha i think weve failed at manners /none/ often  taliesin we fail at manners more often well see how this goes well try being nice  travis ill stay out here  sam ill go knock on the door it seems like a smallish door right  laura yeah ill go with you  matt okay so whats the marching order  sam ill go first  liam nothing perked up my spideysense  matt from this current glance no you guys are behind a tree at a distance  travis no nude giants right  matt currently no but youre keeping an eye out  laura /none/ im walking with a smile looking very friendly  matt whos leading the charge  sam ill go knock  laura ill walk behind scanlan  matt we have scanlan and vexahlia  liam im going to go as well and continue to eyeball for traps  taliesin ill be hanging back a bit as well  marisha ill be comfortably back as well  sam before we knock what were we told was in this thing  travis the key  sam the key inside a person inside a house  laura its possible the person is the key /none/ were not sure  matt is trinket within your necklace for this  laura no hes out  matt okay trinket is out alongside you grog  laura hes a very friendly bear look at him  travis im outside the house  laura trinket smile be friendly  matt as you get across this small walkway towards the front as youre walking with a big smile  vexahlia something catches your eye on the ground right before her and you watch as she steps  forward you reach out and grab her wrist and hold her back before she /none/ steps down  laura what is it  matt there is a large rusted iron bear trap that is open that you almost stepped right into  travis that would be have been donesies  laura i was being friendly and it almost crushed me trinket be careful this thing was made for  you  matt trinket walks up to it  laura no no be careful spit on it  matt growling  laura can he spit can trinket spit  matt bear spitting its not very its more of a power drool if you will  liam /none/ is it easy enough to walk around  matt you can walk around that one and you begin to see what looks to be seven other ones that are  clustered around  taliesin this is probably a giantinfested forest  marisha yes thats exactly why bear traps are the biggest thing you can get for a giant  sam can we evade them and get into  matt you begin to walk around yeah you would actually as you step around one you can see at  the front door there is a welcome mat that says welcome as /none/ youre approaching it you can see  the welcome mat theres just something a little off about it like its raised higher than the  ground should be  travis willkommen  marisha trapped  liam well i could attempt to dicker with it but we could just knock the door over it if we really  are going on manners  taliesin doublecheck to make sure the door isnt a problem either id imagine if the welcome mat  is  liam the doors going to blow up if we knock on it i mean we dont have much /none/ luck with doors  laura can i grab a stick and lift the edge of the mat up  liam do you want to do that  matt are you stopping her from doing that  liam yes i am let me take a look at it please ive already detected it i will attempt to disarm  it with thieves tools correct  matt yes  liam thats fine that is a 29  matt you walk over you look and you watch theres a small cord that is hidden amongst the  brush that runs from underneath the /none/ mat through a small ring that goes up from the house then up a  branch or vine so its hidden amongst them you look straight up about 40 feet you see a nice  solid thick trunk that is just creaking  travis thats some predator shit  matt right above the door  taliesin i feel like theres a complicated story that goes along with all of this im really  excited by it  marisha is this going to be an uncharted kind of adventure  taliesin we have found the cabin of macaulay culkin  matt /none/ so knowing this you walk over and grab the cord looking to see where the leverage is you  motion to grog to come over and hold it you find another piece of heavy stone that is by the wall  to the side with grogs help you snip it bring it over and tie it onto the edge of this piece of  the stonework like a small pole that was placed at the base of the house it holds the weight of  this suspended trunk and it no longer triggers based on the step  liam percy /none/ im sorry i know you like a good rube goldberg  taliesin i was really excited by this thing its a shame to dismantle it  laura its still there maybe when we leave we can crash it down  liam does the door look hinky at all  matt make an investigation check  marisha you did say kinky right  liam i said hinky 18  matt 18 it does not appear to be trapped per se it does appear to be locked  liam yeah well i dont want to pick it  laura i want to /none/ use a stick and oh here scanlan you were going to knock  sam chuckles what is this stick  laura so that you dont have to touch the door in case its magic  matt which as a note the door at full height is about at the shoulders of most of you you  recognize this this is definitely a homestead built on the scale for probably halfling or gnome  its still pretty big for a gnomish home meaning its a little more spacious headroom youd  probably be able to stand in comfortably except for you /none/ grog youre probably a little hunched  liam so its like an ostentatious gnome door little more than is needed  sam like me ill just rap on the door with my knuckles  matt okay there is an awkward pause  sam hello bidet  matt darin if you want to go ahead onto the stage please  cheering  laura im glad he didnt murder us with his bear traps  sam you need this oh you need this oh ive been goosed  liam hey chaotic evil necromancer gnome  matt you werent supposed to tell them /none/  darin i didnt  matt so you hear amongst your business for the day out of nowhere knocking on the door  sam kaitiaki  darin i open it  matt okay you hear clicking what sounds like six or seven different locks unlock on the door  as it slowly swings open and before them what do they see  darin a very small elderly gnome bald on top with a long white beard and a bit of a distant  look in his eyes and he looks at you and says are you real  laura i /none/ think so  darin youre real prove it say that youre real to my invisible frog companion  sam i will step forward and say hello there whispers im real  darin yes youre real there is no invisible frog companion the voices in my head would not  have spoken to that stuttering they know a little bit better than that but that doesnt  matter i havent had people here in over 35 years laughs but youre here and youre real  go away  laughter  darin demistrik show them out  matt you watch as two /none/ tiny red claws come around the corner as these tiny impish wings unfurl you  watch as a tiny imp releases from the edge of the doorframe wings beating get out  door slamming and slams the door  darin and show yourself out demistrik i dont need you here 19 years of you is more than  enough  matt you hear muffling argument through the door as the voice goes ill stay where i damn please  you gave me permission to stay if anyone is going to leave youre going to leave  darin i think you /none/ should go to kraghammer and become a circus performer with a little tin cup  and a little hat and say oh dear i am demistrik the magical imp thats where you  belong i tell you right now  matt sounds like a lot more fun than having to deal with you on a daily basis you son of a  darin offended cry language imp  matt the door creaks open once more sorry door closing  darin the door creaks open again im sorry as well whispering for him hes awful  liam i stick my foot /none/ in  darin no  laughter  liam im really very sorry to bother you although im delighted to make your acquaintance im  having a very hard time not just smiling like an idiot could we trouble you just for a few  moments we mean no harm at all we do need to talk to you weve come a very long way as  farts thats got to count for something  laura singsongy we could give you some interesting conversation 35 years is a very long  time  liam weve done a lot weve seen a /none/ lot we could tell you all about it  sam i play an old traditional gnome song to soften him a bit  matt make a performance check  laura what is an old gnome song  sam i dont know  laughter  sam 24  matt its been a long time since youve heard music let alone one that scratches an old memory  of childhood its nice  taliesin its more or less whatever strikes your fancy to be fair  all humming going to the chapel  matt you see the imp in the back going /none/ ugh stop that racket  darin you dont even appreciate music what would an imp song sound like you cant say one can  you because you dont have music where youre from  matt i can but itll cause your ears to bleed it sounds like this screeching  darin i find that very entertaining  matt youre such a liar the imp poof vanishes before you  darin hes gone dont worry about him he gets a little bit testy if you will  sam may we speak may we have a moment of your time  darin /none/ oh well very well you can come in if you like oh be careful theres illusions and  thingamabobbers  liam stammers sorry thats infectious we have a really big guy are you all right with him  coming in grog are you all right with coming in  travis how the fuck do i get in that damn door  liam have you not crawled on all fours before  taliesin you should try it if you havent its quite delightful  travis are you lying  taliesin no for once no im not  travis can i do /none/ an insight check on percy  matt sure  travis 19  taliesin i have never actually been quite so honest in my entire life i think youll find it  very therapeutic  travis i roll in on all fours  taliesin how does it feel  travis im waiting for it to kick in  taliesin crawl forward back a bit stretch downward dog stretch  matt you watch as this large grayskinned mountain of a man crawls his way in you could  duckwalk through if you really wanted to this is worse than gandalf in bag /none/ end all fours is  probably the most comfortable means of transport through the house but you walk in and  immediately you watch as your new gnomish friend is going around and quickly disabling small  things putting small keys and tying off strings and wires you saw that were set up around portions  of the room  taliesin i am going to try and map this in my head the crazy stuff im seeing right now  matt this place is a hoarders den you see shelves and shelves of books and papers and  scrolls and /none/ stacks of them you see on bits of furniture and chairs more stacks of books and  sacks and satchels and quills and inkwells some spilled and left and dried long ago this place is  very livedin very chaotic and very unique  liam the first thing that i do as we come in is i scan the room or rooms for more macaulay culkin  shenanigans  matt make an investigation check  taliesin maculkins i think we can just call them maculkins now  liam that is a 21  matt okay you do see theres one /none/ portion of the floor that he keeps avoiding instinctually that  catches your attention youre like why does he keep walking around that  marisha whats your name friend  darin oh well that was taken from me a very long time ago i only have what they call me you  know names are an odd thing arent they sometimes a name can stick to you like blood on a  knife or your fingers on a wallet that might not be your property and then who you were is not who  you are and yet here we /none/ are  marisha that oddly made way too much sense  sam what do they call you  darin they call me sprigg theres more they call me sprigg the obnoxious  sam sprigg the obnoxious  darin yes its not my given name it was a name that was given to me when it was given to me  liam did you used to be obnoxious because im not picking that up  darin oh were rarely who we used to be  taliesin is there mercury in those pools  laughter  darin who is that a friend /none/ of yours  taliesin i sometimes will talk to the fourth wall its a thing ignore it  darin its a domicile there has to be four walls if there werent it would be a yurt i  dont live in a yurt dear boy  marisha i sometimes live in a yurt theyre quite nice  darin i have nothing against yurts laughs like a stick that you would put in a yurt so it  wouldnt fall over i would want it to fall over therefore i have nothing against yurts  wheezing laughter demistrik  matt the /none/ imp just appears across the room and just goes good one that was i am  so sorry  laura pike do you think maybe a greater restoration is in order  matt pike goes why  laura no reason  matt could i just touch your hand for a second is that okay  darin stuttering why  matt just to see if we can help your day  darin do you not think that im real  matt probably not  darin i assure you im real im here my companions are long gone they were like you /none/ like  you like you and you and you and im all that is left you are looking into a mirror of your  future  sam im going to look like you or youre going to look like me  marisha no i know what he means who were your companions  darin memories theyre all memories now i dont even remember their names i remember some of  them but we were heroes and now i am here  marisha oh no  liam were there no other gnome folk in your party  darin no there was /none/ one like you there was a big one a mighty one there was one like you brave  and kind  laura thats like me thats exactly like me  darin there was one like you smart yet sad and you as well yeah and i was you  matt pike goes please she grabs your hand and concentrates for a second you watch as the holy  symbol flares for a moment and the warmth passes through her arms into your hand and it feels  nice its like holding a freshly heated cup of tea and as the /none/ spell completes and she pulls  back thats all thank you  darin thank you very kind of you dont ever do that again  matt right okay okay  sam your companions not to bring up sad times how long ago did they go away perish  darin 37 years  sam and how was it in a fight  darin oh yes  sam against a powerful entity  darin oh no against ignorance against bravery that should never have been and thats why im  here and theyre not because i ran you see im your future /none/ youll all be gone you and you and  you and you and you and youll be left  liam while listening to all that vax slid his hand into keyleths and quietly listened to  the whole thing  darin oh well perhaps we should talk of other things should we  sam yes yes we want this to be a positive visit for you so is there anything we can tell you from  the world outside that you might be curious about  darin the world outside who needs the world outside i have everything here and /dung/ what i need  dear boy i have taken from kraghammer all these books over there you see those are mine they  should have been mine to begin with and i took them and now they are mine wheezing laughter  taliesin im going to peruse some of these titles quietly  sam the books you mean  darin yes youd like to look at the books would you  taliesin i find its the easiest way to learn quite a bit about a person  darin oh youre very welcome to look at anything you like what will /none/ you give me dear boy i  require something and yet what do i need living here not much intelligence no secrets no  love no sadness bravery power what do you have that you would give me  travis i reach in the bag of holding i take out percys glasses would you care for a pair of  these testicl spectacles  darin i seek power dear boy not silliness if i wanted silliness i would talk to a sun tree no  one ever should talk to a sun tree they should only listen to a sun /none/ tree and so i shall say  again if you would like to peruse my book and perhaps find what you are looking for what will  you give me that would bring power and redemption into my life  sam what do you have grog  laura whispering give him some ale  travis but thats not fucking power  laura you dont know bet its been a while since hes had some of that  darin it seems you have powerful items  travis i do i have these bracers of defense  darin ah but that is /none/ strength i require power  travis softly shit fuck  taliesin well i reach into my bag and start cleaning a small green shard of residuum  polishing it  darin demistrik if you excuse me for a just while you look ill just talk to my imp youll  pardon us whispering a word demistrik  matt ugh just one moment what  darin the big one worries me i think we should have a code in case we have to jump him  matt what code would you wish  darin goliath grab but we need to remember /none/ that we need to remember that  matt goliath grab good luck  darin we need some sort of mnemonic device to remember goliath grab g goodness gracious grab  that goliath o  matt o huh ill tell you what ive got your back  darin i dont feel that at all youre right in front of me how could you have my back wheezing chuckle  i got you laughing go away so what do you have for me youve had ample time to look in  your bag of holding to produce something very  travis powerful /none/ well i do have one thing that seems to be pretty powerful  marisha oh no grog  travis i pull out of the bag of holding a small leather case i open the flap i dont know if you  have any interest in this but my experience with these items has been very extreme would you care  to take a card  darin would you care to give them to me  sam all or just one  travis no you can pick a card  matt make an arcana check roll a d20 and add your /none/ arcana skill modifier to it  taliesin you are a madman  darin 15  matt 15 you dont recognize what hes holding in his hands but you immediately see the leather  casing around it and your essence being able to read certain elements of magic it does appear to  be a powerful enchantment whatever he has procured from the bag  darin indeed perhaps one card for one book  travis yeah sure i mean percy do you have a book out of all of these that you want to read  darin what are you looking /none/ for what do you seek what knowledge ive got it all here  sam we seek a key  laura to find a very ancient goddess  darin oh dont say ioun  taliesin were not going to say ioun  darin you just did  liam is there another name that you would like us to use like a nickname instead of ioun  darin the broken goddess i know more than ioun please ioun gods what do they know we know  more than they for we exist we live we adventure they merely observe am i right /none/  sam you have a point they dont do much for us in the daytoday  taliesin are you saying you know more than ioun  darin of course i know more than ioun  taliesin can you prove that you know more than ioun  darin yes  taliesin so if i ask you a question that is almost impossible to answer you could answer it  before ioun could answer it  darin could ioun create a rock so heavy that even she couldnt lift it  taliesin oh please im far too clever to ask such a /none/ simple question thats easy i would have  to ask something that was very difficult to answer  darin i will give you your answer if you give me a card  liam you know i was just saying what a good idea i thought it was but i thought you were talking  about the entire deck grog i think the entire deck is a fairer thing than to have him pull a  card because that seems unpredictable to me  travis yeah that sounds perfect to me  liam were all in a small enclosed space together /none/ grog and i like this fellow  laura sprigg it is quite powerful yes but also maybe slightly dangerous  taliesin a bit dangerous to be fair  darin im here alone well theres oh yes go peddle your papers somewhere where theyd like  papers peddled  laura youre not alone at the moment  darin thats true  laura this is very true and id rather not put my life in the hands of you not knowing you very  well  darin some did im here  laura yes  darin they are not  laura so /none/ something bad could happen and youd run away and wed be stuck here  darin no 37 years i ran away ive been here deciding how to live again how not to run away  thats what all this is about isnt it you cant just hide from the world ive done it done it  for a long long time maybe you being here means that i should hide no longer or maybe i just have  an invisible frog friend maybe i have nothing here and nothing here  taliesin whoever has devised these contraptions and created this /none/ safety for you is a genius im  not saying youre necessarily  darin it was both of us  taliesin i somehow dont think so  darin what  matt it was all me  taliesin ive had my own demons to contend with in my life to make me doubt my own intelligence  i get the sense that your compatriot i hate to call it friend here  darin i hate to call it friend and yet i do isnt that right friend  matt unfortunately  taliesin what are you doing here  darin you can /none/ tell them  matt no  darin just tell him  matt no why because he asked me  darin yes be polite theyre guests in our home  matt oh its not our home  darin 19 years youve been here ever since your master died trying to enter and got tricked into  one of my traps and now youre here does that answer your question now why dont you tell  him what i just said  matt my master died trying to get in here on one of

figure that you /none/ recognize from the  shadowfell earlier you see one of the ghastly creatures that was darting through the ruins  leaping from from rooftop to rooftop its skin is grayish and long

/none/ this  matt was that your action there doing that  taliesin that was my action surge i can only do one round just seeing if i have anything at a bonus that  i can do  matt you spent your action

side of the temple and it nearly goes unconscious and picks itself up  again gets its crossbow ready its still holding its not /none/ down yet but its hurt badly  you can see now up close you can see these figures theyre dressed in very very tight black  leathers cloaks enshrouding their body the hood is still up but youve knocked it back there you  see a human male in his late 40s early 50s the head shaved completely bald a tattoo of black  tendrils around the left eye and the left eye is missing from the socket  travis black tendrils okay cool thats my turn  matt thats your turn all right grogs done vax youre up  /none/ liam okay lets talk this out click the boots of haste i think with 120 feet of movement i  can blur up the stairs to where percy is in probably 50 or 60 feet and then finish that  movement and go past the guy out the window with all of my movement in 120 feet or less okay so  im doing that  matt theres also a window here a window here and a window here just so you guys know and a  window here if you wanted  liam definitely understand blur up the stairs /none/ shoot past percy shoot past that guy out the  window  matt youre on the balcony now looking right about here  liam do i already see those guys  matt make a perception check  liam 19 plus 14 is a hell of a lot  matt 19 plus 14 yeah you do see them and you glance down you can see theyre hiding amongst  bushes and theyre specifically stealthed but youre keen of eye enough to see where theyre  placed  liam i stealth hide bonus action to hide im going to use luck thats /none/ better 27  matt 27 okay youre not sure if they see you or not  liam all right then from this spot if theyre in range im going to throw whisper at one of  them  matt right now you are currently up here so you glance off and you can barely see one thats over  the edge of the roof right there thats the only one you can see  liam but i can see them and i can ignore threequarters cover because of sharpshooter  matt so you barely see the edge of one there /none/ sharpshooter id say yeah you can you can hit  both if you want  liam so the one that i can see hidden i will try to throw whisper im going to hopefully sneak  attack him and bamf there that is a 28  matt 28 he does not see you so you have advantage on that if you want to roll again  liam right natural 20  taliesin turn him into paste  liam okay counting  sam did pike roll  matt pike did  laura what did she get  matt 11 typical pike /none/  marisha shes after me  laura well no but sprigg is right after scanlan hes before we are so id rather get him up  before  liam so that one is 60 on that guy  matt 60 points of damage  liam yes and i bamf there  matt as you chuck the dagger like right towards where the center of the shoulderblades connect in  the back he groans and you watch as the crossbow that he had drops to the ground and he crumples  over on top of it but he slowly starts getting /none/ to his feet out of the bushes he looks really hurt  but hes still standing and you appear right next to him there  liam so i did movement i hid for my bonus i have actionaction as a paladin and action  matt you have attackattack as a paladin  liam

so glad  liam 30  /none/ matt 30 hits  liam that is a ten and im going to pump him full of poison he has to make a dc check on 15  matt that is a seven no four plus three  liam so he also gets that was ten plus 14 total 20 total between the dagger and the poison  matt so the second dagger you shiv him in the side and he groans goes to spin with the heavy  crossbow and try and pull away and as soon as the poison through him he goes gurgles and you can see /none/  blood vomit down the front of his chest his eyes roll back and he twinges and falls to the ground  liam and theres another guy there who can see me right  matt yeah and hes hidden but hes like scared heavy breathing  liam whisper  matt okay hes trying to see that youre not being seen  liam that is 31 yeah okay so that is two plus eight is ten plus psychic damage 18 im going  to bamf there with whisper  matt okay all righty you hit him and you stand there youre /none/ right in front of him now all  righty that ends your go

starting to  catch it is dry wood the entire building is made from wood of the forest so your home is now in  flames  marisha wait hang on no im doing the perimeter i did think about this which is why i  didnt attack the guy in the house  travis if you napalm the forest the trees will probably /none/ catch fire  liam its a quick jump though  matt in order to do the perimeter its not a blazing inferno but its starting to catch  flames are starting to lick up the sides  liam end it quick we can save it  matt fire storms a dangerous spell  laura lets try to save those books before they all

front door to the house  marisha right there  sam so id be 20 feet the way we approached to the house so where you got it if thats the way  we approached  matt you guys approached this direction so youre there make a perception check scanlan  sam okay ten  matt okay you dont see the two /none/ hidden fellows over here you see something large and hulking  moving through the forest this direction at a quick glance  sam is it naked  matt no  taliesin then were going to be okay  matt you guys have pulled out of that house youre still on the ground and all of a sudden  your body physically shifts and youre looking up at the trees you glance around and you can see the  back of your house you can hear the frantic fray going on you see the necromancer whos currently  covered in brambles /none/ and held in place you see a couple of guys on fire on the side screaming on  the side of the house and your house starting to catch fire thats okay pike on her turn is  going to  marisha keyleth has anger issues its fine  matt because its a single target  sam its the this is fine meme except its just keyleth  matt shes going to cast a level five guiding bolt because thats what pike does so ranged spell  attack against that guy 11 plus yeah that hits thats a 21 so /none/ that is 8d6 radiant damage  nice 19  laura is she doing it to the magician  matt no this guy right there in the room  sam hes an illusionist laura  travis is she doing it against copperfield is david blaine with them  matt so after she heals sprigg and sprigg vanishes she grabs her holy symbol and goes  chill out and shoots this giant flashing beam of divine energy that slams into it you watch as  a lot of its flesh burns away from the impact its still standing but its a shining /none/ beacon  the next attack against it has advantage and then pikes going to back up with you vex towards the  back where the bookcase is and goes you smell something you now hear simultaneously  slow thudding and watch as the side wall and the back wall explode inward as splinters of wood and  stone crashing comes from this wall here  laura oh no all of his stuff  marisha so i didnt destroy your house first  liam flames flames less of a thing  taliesin on the side of the house  liam flames /none/ on the side of the house  matt two familiar hulking entities come barrelling into the chamber remember those giant  things you saw walking through the shadowfell that you barely avoided with the mask  marisha the censer  matt who has the censer not on you right now you dont carry a fucking giant smoking censer  with you  laura oh really i didnt realize it was that big  taliesin i think at that point i think we put it in the bag of holding  sam but you did make a bunch of those herbs /none/  marisha i do have the herbs  sam and theres a shitton of shit on fire right now  matt they burst through roaring this big yell echoes through their metal masks it sounds like  this horrible imagine a giant vocal scream thats peaking on the audio level against a tinny  metallic speaker  liam bane voice your punishment will be more severe  matt essentially this ones going to go after keyleth this ones going to make two swipes at  trinket because trinkets right there as they barrel through part of the roof breaks guys /none/ up  top percy and grog you feel the ground buckle a little bit below you and you drop about two or  three inches as the building is starting to lose its physical frame  taliesin oh god grog what did keyleth do  travis thanks keyleth you beat me by one second  taliesin im well aware it was totally worth it  marisha thankskeyleth  matt thats ones going to go ahead and do two slam attacks against keyleth  marisha yeah ive earned it come on  matt thats 23 to hit  marisha yeah that /none/ hits  matt and thats a 29 to hit  marisha yeah  matt thats 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first hit and the second one is 30 points of  bludgeoning damage two slams and it slams you the second fist actually pins you up against the  wall there and you feel ribs crack inside your chest and now theyre both down low in this  hulking mass theyre almost wider than they are any other dimension with how theyre crouched down  and the thickness of their body theyre taking up almost the entirety of /none/ the room right now  marisha you said 30 points right  matt yes for the second one  marisha so im at 83 points  matt correct the other ones going to slam twice into trinket giant fists thats going to be a  28  laura 28 hits  matt and a 22  laura 22 hits  matt that is five plus six 11 points of bludgeoning damage to trinket  laura halved  matt halved correct and 22 points of bludgeoning damage halved  laura okay so 11 plus six is 27 points  matt that /none/ ends their go were at the top of the round percy youre upstairs  taliesin okay this all happened thats awkward thats okay i know where i am im going to run  out onto the balcony really quick  marisha theres room over here  travis

perception check actually you wouldnt even see  them from your /none/ perspective  taliesin i just rolled a natural 20  matt right its blocking your vision from this side you do see scanlan you see sprigg who is  currently conscious you see this necromancer who is currently held with brambles and you see two  streaking flames and hear screams on this side of the building  taliesin weird question really quickly where is that giant log trap  matt right there  taliesin how much swing does it have is it locked all the way over here or is it hung back  there  matt it looks /none/ more like a drop  taliesin oh so its a drop on the door good to know in the meantime im going to run on the  exterior of the wall like right over here if that makes sense thats going to be my movement  im going to take some fun happy pot shots at these bastards  laura at the necromancer  taliesin at the necromancer lets start with that bound necromancer hes fun  liam with the vecna eye  taliesin with the vecna eye hes bound so i have advantage to hit him  matt yes /none/ you do  taliesin all right im going to use my animus gun so i still have a hand open and im also  going to burn a point of grit so that i can get him to drop his staff here we go with advantage  oh darn it was so close 28  matt that hits  taliesin thats ooh fancy 18 points of damage four points of psychic damage and he has  to make a strength saving throw or drops his items  matt oh dont worry he drops the staff because theres not much left /none/ of his head when you hit  the arm the staffs clutching but you slam it and it hits the side of the head and causes the  right side of the face to explode against the tree the brambles still clutching as it falls  limp to the ground and they crush the body into a small rock of flesh  taliesin thatll do  marisha you get a grit point back right  laura you get a grit point back you get a grit point back  matt you just barely see them they have threequarters cover but /none/ you have sharpshooter  taliesin threequarters cover what does that mean in this crazy world im going to burn a grit  for advantage and shoot one of them  matt the one right furthest on the side there  taliesin yeah ill start there lets give it a shot i love advantage its so wonderful 32 i  really should have done extra damage so thats 1d10 plus six that hits obviously 32 to hit  matt yeah that hits goodbye necromancer  taliesin 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage  matt how much was /none/ that sorry  taliesin 17 points of damage plus two points of psychic damage  matt okay all right hes still standing bullet impact yelps he starts looking up to see  where the shot came from as the giant bullet wound through the torso and out the back of the shoulder  was clean through you hear him breathing gasping for breath gasping  taliesin im going to take another shot at him im going to make this a sharpshooter shot and  again with advantage because thats fun here we go damn almost a crit thats 29 that /none/ hits  matt that hits yeah go ahead and roll damage  taliesin 14 points of damage im sorry 24 points of damage plus two points of psychic  damage  matt he falls to the ground face first the second shot hits him in the chest he just goes  down crumples his body begins to smolder  taliesin i use my bonus action to reload and stare at the nice person below me  matt that ends percivals turn grog youre up you hear downstairs the heavy thudding  theres the guy in front of you whos like /none/ angry breathing what are you going to do  travis can i smash my titanstone knuckles together and cast enlarge on myself  matt you can and your head goes into the roof thudding  marisha were real sorry about your house  darin it wasnt a house it was a prison  laura well then youre

beautiful can i take tweedledee to my right /none/ and make two reckless attacks against him  theyre not giants right  matt no theyre not giants theyre considered undead  travis theyre considered undead 30 to hit and the second one  matt big targets  travis 29  matt hits  travis so ten 24 points plus the enlarge 25  matt 25 with the first hit whack  travis 22 with the second one  matt 22 damage on the second hit whacks youre hitting him laying on its back it has these  metal spikes jamming out of its flesh you can see portions of /none/ other creatures that it had slain that  have been jammed on these spikes and rotted away on its armor so as youre hitting it youre  knocking away parts of partially decomposed creatures that previously fell in battle to one of  these creatures as youre slamming into it you can see its just rippling partially decayed  muscle that seems to be unnaturally strengthened by whatever necrotic energy keeps it stitched  together and alive its a thick sack of hit points  travis wow cool good to know  matt is that your turn are you doing /none/ anything else  travis thats interesting im going to go into a frenzied rage as my bonus action  matt okay and thats the end of your turn okay end of grogs turn vax youre up you heard all  this go on and now the whole building is starting to catch fire  liam im going to bolt to that window  matt right there  liam no other way so i have a view of keyleth the creature and grog im going to throw  whisper ive got sharpshooter at that thing and bamf there  matt i /none/ will say at proximity to the

roll an attack  liam and its flanking right because of where grog is or keyleth  matt its not flanking but you get to add sneak attack modifier  liam okay yeah thats fine thats 32  matt yeah that hits so you appear next to it  liam /none/ three plus psychic damage is four plus this junk counting 33 doubled to 66 plus psychic  damage is 74 bamf there  matt and you appear next to it as the dagger sinks into its torso you watch as its chest  muscles and the iron cagelike armor around it seems to swallow the dagger as it goes inside  you watch as some of the muscles all of a sudden squelch fall off of its body like whatever  energys holding it together is untethered and this weird fleshy stitchedtogether creature is  starting to fall apart its /none/ looking pretty hurt  liam okay so heres what i wanted to do so movement and i have actionaction action  action actionaction action bonus action  travis laura and marisha repeating action action  liam guys its the rules in the book you can bust my balls all you want  matt well thats your first attack so you have your second attack  liam so actionaction for my regular attack right  matt attackattack  liam its just semantics attackattack

liam whatever i just said it was like 16  travis 17  matt 17 17 will do it actually so as you rush in with the second dagger you jam up into the  same space where its falling apart and you hear this dull shockwave sound on the inside as the  divine energy radiates from the strike and its body slurping sloughs off of the bones and  around your arm it slowly falls around your arm like old gelatin and slurping slips into the  ground covering the floor around you  liam okay /none/ im going to do the old crouch not that she needs it but crouch in front of keyleth  and then i have my hasted action for an attack and bonus action for an attack into the other one  29 and the second one is higher than 29 im going to dump smite into it three youre making  me mess up the math laura  laura psychic damage  liam laughing i cant keep track of the math  matt singing epiclevel dnd  liam 25 on that towards that guy with smite added and then the last /none/ dagger with smite at  level one is two plus is 10 14 19  matt 19 okay  liam i dumped a ton of smite into that  matt you didnt add your modifier to the third strike right  liam i dont know so why dont you just minus six 19 so well call it 13 some people might  have been catcalling me while i was trying to do math  matt thats okay no worries you hit with the two final strikes they blast into it you watch  as some of the armor gets thrown /none/ off its body it takes a little hit but the other creature looks  like its largely all right that finishes vaxs turn  liam let me enjoy my last two months of life  matt shadow ghast whats the dc on the sphere again  sam 20  matt is it 20 19 he cant escape from this freaking sphere the shadow ghast is up on the  second floor going growling manners man all right scanlan and sprigg what do you

now its too far away to cast a spell  matt no depending on the spells range depending on what you want to do  darin tashas hideous laughter  /none/ matt that we can do  marisha thats such a good spell  matt its a fun one so bringing up tashas here looking at the range there we go its a 30feet  range so you want to get up and get a little closer probably  darin i will do that if i could  matt all right so thats half your movement and you can move two more spaces you can hit one guy  so one guy of these two you can select  darin the first one  matt that one there all righty  /none/ darin yes i think his name is dave roll a perception  matt make a saving throw a wisdom save that is a ten your spell dc is a 17 you watch as the  guy there who has his crossbow out and sees you get up spins around has this giant heavy  crossbow the bolt very recognizable because you still have three of them in your body aims it  towards you and then suddenly maniacal laughter and drops the crossbow to the ground and doubles  over laughing falling to the ground and is now kicking and /none/ laughing like a hyena right now  unable to do anything  darin knock knock  matt maniacal laughter  darin right  laughter  matt all right is that your turn  darin yes it is  matt all right  sam theres another guy over there have i seen him yet  matt you havent actually you do see this guys on fire right now who is still around  sam oh i see somebody  matt yeah and you can see that hulking figure come running through and you hear the explosion  through the back of /none/ the building  sam for the beginning of the round ill say guys i think large giants are coming be aware  laura and travis screaming  sam what i cant hear you speak clearly  liam threepio where could he be  sam okay shit ill approach the guy i can see burning on fire thats where the front door is  right is he in front of the front door  matt the log is right up in this area  sam oh yeah that so ill take out my wand of magic missiles and i will just /none/ take down  the rope  matt okay you watch as three missiles fire out of the wand and slam into the bits of rope up top  as they explode its enough of an impact to cause it as opposed to fall straight down just spin  and fall im going to go ahead and roll a dice to see which direction its going to land from its  front point so well say inward would be one two three four five six thats a six so it  plummets down hits the ceiling scrapes off and slams down /none/ onto him hes going to try and make a  dexterity saving throw that is a seven plus four nope thats an 11 go ahead and roll 4d8 please  laura 4d8  darin is this dr comedy whos writhing in laughter  matt i think so oh no sorry hes over here this guys on fire from her earlier  sam oh thats a five 16  matt 16 points of damage to him  sam thats not a lot  laura you only got 16 on 4d8  matt its not enough to kill him but it slams /none/ on him and then falls over you see as both of his  flaming hands on the ground going groans hes currently restrained underneath it right there  and on fire  darin knock knock  laughter  matt all right you going to stay where you are  sam no im going to move towards any entrance or window i see i cant really see over there  matt theres a window here window here this one has flames in front of it this ones available  sam ill go towards that no audio other one  matt okay /none/ four five thats as far as you can move there you see the guy on the ground whos  laughing in front of you  sam yeah no thanks to him and for a bonus i guess i will inspire darin de paul or rather  sprigg  liam why not both  sam i will sing to him singing you had a bad day you gettin knocked down i sing you a song  just to turn it around you say you dont know but please dont die ill sing you this song and  maybe youll go for /none/ a ride you had a bad day speaking i dont know how that song goes  matt all righty so you get an inspiration die you get a d12 that you can use on any sort of  skill you dont have to use it right now but whenever you use a skill check or an ability check  you can add that to it if you want to there you go  darin thank you you know i had a bad day  sam singing you had a bad day  groaning and laughing  matt all right so /none/ now its the assassins turn keyleth how much fire damage does it do when  theyre on fire is it d10  marisha stuttering oh jeez fire storm yeah no d10  matt thought so all right he takes eight fire damage  taliesin yay under a log  matt under a log hes going to try and break free from restraint nope that is a 14 he cannot  move that giant tree thats currently crushing him on the ground he tries to reach out for his  crossbow and aim it out towards sprigg with one hand because /none/ its still loaded but he has super  disadvantage on this strike  sam super disadvantage is that in the book  matt it is now  laura thats in the new campaign guide super disadvantage only when youre stuck under a tree  on fire  matt sure ill do all three all right eight 12 12 i made him roll super disadvantage what does  this remind me of like a terrible old scifi movie where the bad guys on the ground with the  gun trying to aim it at the hero with his final shot and /none/ the hero just walks up and steps on the  gun you whoosh sidestep the bolt as it fires nothing on you  darin of course  matt the crossbow drops grunting  darin knock knock  matt crying on fire all righty that ends his turn  darin whispering comedy comes in threes  matt this guy back here is going to go ahead and since youre the one who has his friend writhing  on the ground is going to go ahead and try to shoot you with his crossbow you do see him  although hes unaware /none/ of that so he thinks its a sneak attack shot that is a 14  taliesin you got to get better cultists man  matt i know seriously they come in large numbers so yeah this one just impact sound  hits the tree to your left his aims off  travis hes missing an eye his depth perception sucks  matt exactly and he goes ahead and darts behind this building there vanishing  sam did i see the bolt or any indication that he exists  matt you do he reveals himself when he fires so you watched /none/ him come out of the bushes and  whoosh fire and then duck around the side of the building the guy on the ground is going to try  and save against your spell that is a 13 plus zero nope hes still laughing hes just on the  ground laughing tears in his eyes now  taliesin i love that spell  matt thats the end of the assassins turn necros dead vex youre up  laura im going to hunters mark the big undead monster in the room and then im going to shoot  him with the /none/ blazing bowstring  taliesin be careful you might catch the building on fire  laura oh but im going to use the sharpshooter thing  matt take minus five and do additional damage okay  laura which i dont know if i should have done that on this particular one it was 17 to hit  matt 17 is exactly his armor class  liam yas pelor queen  laughter  laura five plus eight is 13 plus sneak attack because hes got trinket next to him 13 18 23  sorry 23 and then lightning damage 24 25 26 /none/ and then blazing bowstring god dang 27  matt okay 27 so thats your first strike arrow shot first one just impact sound hits in  the side and you see the bolt of energy arc out and the flames burn up the arrow by the way the  wall behind you is starting to get really warm  laura im going to move forward im going to actually move toward the corner where keyleth is  matt theres a guy on the ground there  laura oh there is  matt yeah so youve got to step over him /none/  laura im going to step on him  matt as you move past he does get a swing with his shortsword at you oh wow thats a 25  laura oh wow he hits me probably because i stepped on him  matt i think so so you take nine points of slashing damage just like pain sound as youre  walking past  laura pain sound fuck ah shit okay im going to hit the big hulking thing again  matt i realized he had disadvantage but i rolled another 18 so its fine  laura oh okay /none/ well yeah im going to do the same thing with the big hulking guy  matt okay  laura 25 to hit  matt 25 hits  laura oh i didnt add plus ten to the previous one  matt because of the sharpshooter all right 39 last time so go ahead and take a swing at it  laura thanks 14  matt youre up next keyleth  laura 14 plus six is 20  sam figure out how youre going to ruin darins life more  marisha i know thats my one goal in life im a big /none/ old homewrecker  laura i think thats just 32 because i dont get sneak attack again  matt all right so the second arrow slams into him its still holding firm its taking the hits  and you see parts of its body are starting to spill black liquid out of the wounds and growls  its red eyes still beaming out from behind the metal mask in front of its face its arm swings  back and tears some of the ceiling beams out with it its looking pretty rickety right now so that  ends your turn  /none/ laura i guess so  marisha is it in a fireproof safe no okay  matt keyleth youre up  marisha all right so i have this big asshole in front of me yeah the house is catching on fire  right yeah nope shed still be really upset and really angry so continuing what i was saying  before shes gonna rage a little bit more and go into her fire elemental self  matt okay  marisha unable to contain her frustration  taliesin this is a good plan  matt you technically entered the space of the /none/ guy whos on the ground becoming a fire elemental  which lights him on fire screams  marisha even more upset im gonna move right in the space of this guy  matt whoosh so occupying his space from this side well say she can catch you guys on fire  laura but she doesnt have to  matt ill doublecheck that real fast  marisha i mean im magical  taliesin sparkle fire  marisha i sparkle fire  liam also we can take it  taliesin yeah its fire  matt you know what it can move through

my multiattack two slam  touch attacks  matt go for it he is now in flames  marisha thats cocked ooh thats good thats good 21  matt 21 yeah  marisha and 16  matt 16 just misses  marisha fucking balls okay no plus six to 11 thats 17  matt that hits thats /none/ what you needed  marisha so both of those hit 2d6 plus three first one is eight plus ten 18 fire damage  matt hes looking pretty hurt as you slam him with both of your flaming hands and claw across  his body where the flame hits you see it hissing singes through the flesh and drags  charred remains of where the muscle once was where you dragged your claws through the bodys starting to  shake as its holding its form together  marisha thats all ive got i think thats it  sam no you have /none/ action action action action action  laughter  marisha and taliesin bonus action  laura hasted action  liam send all your complaints to mike mearls and chris perkins at wizards of the coast  sam matt not to be a dick but has anyone stepped on the trap on the floor  matt actually you know what vax would have avoided it because vax is in the spot where it  was but vax knew where it was so vax would have probably gone over it  sam so cool youre doing the little splits over it  liam /none/ splitsing van dammeing it  matt wait you wouldnt have because when you threw the dagger  liam lets do it  matt its not a big deal thank you for pointing that out  sam but your boots are gone  liam she stole them again how did you do it  matt you guys glance upward as you hear a deep swoosh and up above you in the hole in the  ceiling where there once was nothing but air you see hovering above you a giant beholder just  appear guttural moan all of its eyestalks curling /none/ around it  marisha what do you mean its not a big deal

bolt at the large guy there  thats going to be a 20 that hits thats going to be 4d6 14 points of radiant damage /none/ which will  do it so you watch as pike blasts it in the face with the guiding bolt as it hits the mask gets  thrown off and where the head was beneath it you see this empty black void with two red burning  coals for eyes that blink out as soon as the mask is removed and the whole body crumples to the  ground and turns into a horrible thick blackpurple ichor  laura im going to have nightmares about that  sam for sure  matt the beholder is still upstairs staying in place

rerolling that  /none/ matt no its not a saving throw you cant do that  taliesin its not a saving throw oh well thats fine thats a 16  matt ill say for the purposes of this  taliesin i had the spider climb boots  matt right i know but spider climb boots only helps you if you keep on the surface so as you  leap you manage to land on your feet but the flames do catch you a bit so you take six points  of fire damage as you start to burn for the purposes of time on /none/ this one the guy whos  currently under the log just burns to death there under the log pinned hes trying to reach for  his crossbow but hes only fired the one bolt that was loaded in it the guy on the ground is  still laughing as you approach him  darin are there any rocks about  matt yeah theres quite a few heavier rocks on the ground  darin well i look at him and i say it was a prison but it was my prison and i use the  telekinesis ring to lift a /none/ rock and drop it on his head  matt splat a horrible sickening crack sound it slams into the head you lift it up the laughing  has stopped but hes still moving and you can see the face is broken the nose is smashed to the  side and its just blood hes starting to try and get back up  darin well tell them that ethred brokenbranch sends his regards  matt do you let him get up  darin yes  matt he gets up grunting  sam ill lightning bolt him as he runs away

elemental  travis i skip on in and gibberish yell  matt hes like scream impact just smashed on the ground red watermelon  laura fires out im assuming  marisha i drop my fire form turn see my anger destruction get immediately guilty and then do a  tidal wave to quell the flames  matt the building is standing mostly the whole front of it is blackened the flames are gone  most /none/ of the interior is destroyed you have two giant holes in the back most of the upper ceiling  is ruined the house is in shambles  laura what about the books  matt a lot of them have been destroyed some of the ones on the back wall have been burned some  of them have been burned by people in flames or made of flame or general black ichor that spilled  out the house is pretty wrecked  laura can i go over to them and see if i can find some books i think percy would /none/ like  matt make an investigation check  sam im running over to see that staff with an eye in it  laura 27  matt 27 okay you start glancing through you find some history books you find some that relate  to local history you see some books that relate to various types of creatures some animals and  beasts many that are encyclopedias of various rivers and its scattered everywhere its just  universal knowledge of pretty much anything he can get his hands on so some of it seems less useful  than others but you /none/ handpick a few out that you think percy would like  travis i dont mean to ask the obvious question but how did he know we were here  taliesin no thats not an obvious question i have no idea  marisha they have multiple eyes  laura but how was he watching us is he scrying on us  taliesin must have  laura oh hes fucking scrying on us  taliesin maybe he can feel you the way you can feel him  matt you get the sense thats not how this works  taliesin yeah i dont /none/ know  marisha he had another eye right  sam does that thing have an eye in it  matt the staff you see its a carved eye its made of wood and paint its ornamental its  mainly used as a focus technically acts as a plusone staff  travis sprigg you said this place was a prison did you mean that  darin of course i meant it boy ive been there for years  travis could you leave if you wanted  darin of course i can the prison was more up here than in there  /none/ travis oh sorry about the prison then  darin why would you be sorry i

sidestep all the bear traps along the way  youve walked the path many times and you know it and im actually surprised none of you walked into  any of them you knew where most of them were but none of you wandered out far enough into the open  to do that theyre all /none/ inside you can see your giant friend of course that you were talking to  as you walked in is twice the size he was earlier previously where you had to hunch youre now  having to almost belly crawl inside the house  travis but why theres no separation between the first and the second floor  matt so if you stand in that space youre fine  travis im in my space  taliesin im going to prop our idiot up in the window so i can go in and keep an eye on him even  while /none/ im inside  sam we have a prisoner  taliesin yeah i kept one  laura but hes one of those creepy ghouls that probably doesnt speak  matt and in the last minute or so has not been able to break free but is still trying  taliesin he automatically fails until 24 hours has elapsed  matt after the first failed save  taliesin any further attempts by the creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed he  aint going nowhere its mean man  laura me

face  travis i thought you were on fire im really sorry  matt pike takes you over to the center of the room and tells you kneel with me now take this  book and close your eyes and apologize  darin for what  matt for everything you said about ioun  darin grumbles all right well look the other way find some things that are of value  travis whistles  laura trinket sits down next to him and stares but ill turn around  darin all right i dont know if youre listening /none/ ioun its been many years since ive  actually spoken to a god id like to express my deepest sorrow you see this home didnt mean  as much to me as life and i think these people gave that to me if you could give us if you  could give me anything any little hint it would be greatly appreciated and i would be a warrior in  your name forevermore please was that okay bear  matt huffs licking licks the side of your face  darin no im not crying youre crying bear  matt you /none/ sit there in silence with your eyes closed concentrating holding the book before  you doesnt seem to be an answer just silence in the darkness nothing everyone wants to  look at him still turned away  marisha keyleth is definitely staring but pretending not to stare  taliesin im watching through the book  laura im leaning against the wall and staring at him now  matt nothing nothing responds as you have your eyes closed you hear this soft chuckle in the far  corner of the room cackles really praying are you  darin yes can /dung/ you help  matt do i look the kind of guy that would help  darin yes ive known you for 19 years and i think anybodys capable of anything so why dont  you do something unexpected  matt i think youre right its no longer your prison its not mine either  darin thats true  matt flapping flies out the window  taliesin oh shit  darin kraghammer has another performer and not a very good one  matt while youve been talking by the way and the silence has been sad taking in the slight  /none/ emotional cut that not getting a response and putting yourself on that limb means nothing the  rest of you notice his torso is glowing bright blue  marisha what is it really  matt yeah  travis your stomach is glowing  darin growing what i didnt eat anything how could my stomach be growing  sam youre blue balling  darin what  sam whispering look down  matt pike looks at you and takes your hands and opens your arms and motions to your chest and the  book in your hand you pull aside you glance /none/ down and you can see theres this soft bluish glow  thats emanating from your torso strange  darin you see i didnt have to believe in ioun ive found my religion chuckling im bluish  laughter  travis aw man  darin it didnt happen  matt no it did thats canon  darin wait a second gentlemen well restart for just a second itll be fine that little imp is  gone so apparently the key is me  laura is you it is you  sam is in you or is you  marisha it is him /none/ ive known it from the minute that i laid eyes upon him its him  travis you did you knew that the moment you saw him  marisha no i mean i had a hunch i had a feeling deep down inside i cant say it if i  say it out loud and then if its not true then im an asshole  liam to be fair weve only been here 12 minutes  darin yes house gone the imp gone burny burny sad sad pray nothing happened now im  blue thats a day for you isnt it /none/  laura so do you

darin well i have been gone for many many years so english may have changed to be fair to be  fair i dont know this is all new to me i would have thought it would be in one of those tomes  taliesin im going to pick up the book /none/ that he was holding when he was praying im going to just  try and read it  matt okay you glance through it the book is a simple book talking about the construction of  barricades and it looks like it was less  the contents of the book and more just the image  of the book itself  taliesin im going to hand him the book again and see if maybe theres focus to be found maybe this  is  matt okay make a perception check  taliesin oh lord ooh lets call that a 28 /none/  matt when you took the book from him and handed him another book there was a very faint vibration  to his body as you pulled it from him and gave it back to him which you havent noticed but  theres a physical vibration to him  taliesin if its all with your permission im going to take his hands  matt okay you feel them and you feel this very faint vibration to his body  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha continue holding his hands i pull out the tome of quick movement hold hold /none/ while i  find the paper hold  laura what if hes a tuning fork  marisha shushes  darin thats very rude  marisha where is it i have a lot of things  sam divining  darin oh yes a divining rod a rod to the divine perhaps i am a divining rod  laura thats what i mean  darin well said child  marisha i pull out the fork we that we got to get to elysium is it similar  matt when you pull out the fork and you hold it you recall that whenever /none/ you cast the spell plane  shift there was a faint vibration to the specific fork when you cast the spell  sam and taliesin hes the tuning fork  marisha oh no  laura what no this is good  marisha no it is good its good its just oh sprigg no its fine its good i dont  know everything in my life seems to have this impermanence factor about it so i hope hes not  something that can be used and discarded  darin i havent been used in 37 years  marisha sprigg  darin /none/ its all right at least i wasnt discarded all that time  marisha im sure its fine i just  darin look look at me just remember whatever happens remember me thats all thats  important  liam thats good advice  darin thats all that we have my friends are gone and i dont even remember their names i  dont remember thetapax or zephyr or the guy with the nose he was my favorite  coughs and sniffles dusty in here isnt it  marisha oh sprigg  darin sniffles and coughs i remember softer i remember see /none/ its all up here so whatever  happens keep me there all right  marisha i guess i have to start getting used to losing things  darin yes or you can be hidden away in a prison for 37 years and thats not life child thats  hiding dont hide  marisha ive already built my own prison they dont know im already there  darin you can break out you can its hard but you can do it just take the first step and then  you take another one and then you take another one  marisha /none/ and i grab his hand and with that i cast plane shift to wherever he is leading to go  matt all right the rest of you gathered hands for this  laura i guess so  matt all right  laura is there enough of us trinket in the necklace quick  matt trinket roars into the necklace  darin wait my invisible frog companion  sam is he real  darin yes  laughter  matt there is a sudden sucking noise a shuddering of power energy around you as you feel  the vibration out of spriggs /none/ hand emanate throughout the entire loop you guys have created  throughout your grasp the familiar bright light flashes before you and you feel your body being  pulled through at incredible speeds through darkness there the familiar racing of the divine  gate fast travel noise as you pass through one of its many portholes then adrift by now  youve the times youve passed through the gate youve passed through it a handful of times since  now adrift still holding hands but the circles beginning to turn into an oval you can all glance  around and /none/ see each other did you miss your destination did you overshoot whats next  whoosh another white flash and suddenly youre at a destination you glance around and youre  standing within a small chamber it resembles a decadent bathhouse but with no water nor occupants  its empty there are marble pillars stretching to a domed ceiling about 60 feet above you all  silkdraped cloths drift and hang at odd angles throughout the ceiling glowing points of magical  light latched within iron cages dangle at the edges of these pillars about 15 feet up that give  /none/ the faint glow to an otherwise darkened room there are walls on each side of this chamber  about 30 or 40 feet from you and one arched hallway across from you that leads to the only  other chamber youve seen  marisha i immediately turn and look to see if sprigg is still holding my hand  matt sprigg is still holding your hand  laura see all that fucking shit was for nothing hes still alive  sam are you the same sprigg as before  darin i hope so lets ask my invisible frog companion well /none/ i guess wed better go find what we  are looking for  marisha okay glad youre with us sprigg  darin its good to be alive  marisha yes it is  darin remember that  marisha okay i will  matt as you guys walk forward towards the singular hallway you go through the domed arch  and the hallway extends on featureless smooth grey marble like a solid punch that seemed to  have carved out whatever this material was it extends for 100 feet 150 feet and even though  theres very very faint light and /none/ many of you can see through darkvision there is a darkness about  60 feet from you that seems to consume what you can see you can only see so far beyond that  radius and youre not quite sure where that oppressive shadow is coming from the air is  chilled but not uncomfortably so you can hear the distant sound of pinched winds whining through  small spaces a familiar sound from the many times youve spent underground through caverns that had  some openings that allowed air to streak through to the surface  a few steps /town/ more and suddenly the hallway opens into a second chamber into a library if you could  even call it that bookshelves that stretch upward for seemingly hundreds of feet before flickering  lights fell from your vision you do not see where they stop these columns of just tomes and cases  and scrolls and parchments stacking as in tablets and any form of recorded information seem to just  be infinite in front of you to two sides of this road and upward they seem to stretch in almost  every direction the walls to the side of /none/ you you see columns ahead of you and they tend to wind  and curl like a labyrinth made of bookcases to no end its very escheresque in how the further up  you look they tend to curve and shift and bend around each other  your eyes now attuned to the realms beyond mortality you catch glimpses of shifting wind  gathering books and turning pages spirits of the library though sparse as they may be from this  entry point organizing reading and learning from whatever words are within you begin to almost get  vertigo trying /none/ to contemplate the strange and overwhelming construction of such a wondrous  place an endless sea of stories spectral custodians keeping the tales of each other and the  history of exandria past present and binding the pages to tell what will eventually be the present  currently the future  taliesin ive dreamed of this place  liam inside matts brain  taliesin this is immortality this is everything sighs chuckles i may never leave i glide over  to vex and hold her close this is stunning my god i think they may have actually forgotten all  /none/ the idiot things i said yesterday  laura feels pretty good doesnt it  taliesin i think theyve completely forgotten im sorry may have panicked  laura i give him a kiss  taliesin ill be right back im going to run towards one of those stacks like a child  matt okay you begin to take the first  taliesin im doing a title run i want to figure out the organizational system before i touch a  book  matt there are no words on any of the spines  taliesin i pick one  matt okay you /none/ pick  taliesin all right i pick it up i look around to see if anybody has a problem and i turn to the  title page  matt its ironic you do this because the book is in celestial  taliesin i read celestial  matt you do its ironic that you did that chuckles glancing through it appears to be  describing a birth describing a tunnel then a light then a cry  taliesin i skip to the end last page  matt it seems to be an older man surrounded by his family  taliesin ive /none/ got it i put it down i pick up another one  matt you glance through this book  taliesin first page  matt begins very similarly to the last one  taliesin last page  matt this one actually ends with what appears to be a horseback riding accident  marisha oh god theyre souls  taliesin 115 pages in  matt 115 pages in you get to a page that seems to talk about the sorrow of a lost romance and  trying to deal coping at a young adult age  taliesin i put it back and /none/ i turn theyre made of people  laura wait what its skin books  taliesin its people and im going to find the most interesting spine and im going to turn to  the first birth death  laura i cant read that dear  taliesin birth death sex birth death some disappointment i am just gone im running back  and forth finding whatever interesting spine i can are they all in celestial  matt they are currently all the ones youve picked up are in celestial  taliesin oh my god okay this is great all right im /none/ eventually probably going to pass out  from mild hyperventilation and have to sit down  laura we should maybe find ioun dont you think  taliesin if we must yes just as an experiment im going to think about vesper and try and touch  a book i dont expect this to work but im going to close my eyes and think about and pick it up  and flip through it  matt make a religion check  taliesin nope  matt you grab a tome and pull it forth and as you read through the story its /none/ an unfamiliar  one  taliesin theres a system i will discover the system im going to keep running around like a  kid  matt what are the rest of you guys doing while percival is running around like a kid  travis im not interested in the fucking books  marisha distracted by percy keyleth just scans does anything in primordial stick out  matt make a perception check  marisha thats good 29  matt glancing about none of the spines have anything written on them so you have to start  pulling a few books out /none/ and opening them  marisha i hold my hand over and pull  matt you open it up its not in a language you understand  marisha i put it back and get frustrated  taliesin ive stopped im good  liam watched her the whole time and quietly walk up behind and give her a hug from behind and dont  say anything  sam are there any doors leading forward or back  matt its a labyrinth of bookshelves theres a path forward between two or three ahead of you  but then it comes to an end /none/ where it splits off in two directions like i said they travel up  infinitely so youre not quite sure which way leads where  laura is sprigg still glowing  matt sprigg is actually theres a very faint blue glow in him that never really faded since  your arrival  laura i wonder if we could follow the glow warmer  marisha hey sprigg stand over there  darin all right i run to where shes pointing is there any change in the glow  matt no noticeable change  marisha damn sprigg stand over there  darin /none/ i just was shot with a bunch of arrows so give me a second i run over there stop halfway  and go ow and then i continue when i get there any change in the glow  matt make a perception check  darin oh its a one  matt no discernible difference  sam youre inspired if you want to use inspiration  matt its a natural one its an autofail  taliesin is there a card catalog  sam is there a central area info desk  matt you can make an investigation check to begin to /none/ wander around and try to find your way  sam oh thats a natural 20  matt scanlan seems to walk with purpose into one of the random rows  sam im clutching my ioun stone  matt okay all right anyone else do anything  taliesin he seems to have purpose im giddily following behind  matt okay percys following scanlan  laura im going to walk with percy oh and trinkets out  matt okay trinket bear grunt looks confused and starts looking up  laura i know i know dear  matt falls onto his back  /none/ sam are vex and percy walking with me  matt yes

taliesin we were asked to plead for your life and i may have panicked  laura who did you tell percival who did you tell  sam look at your shirt  laura what screams no  taliesin i panicked  laura percy  /none/ taliesin i panicked there was a giant glowing sun and i may have panicked well i was a bit  vague but i was  laura a bit vague scanlan what did he say  sam well  taliesin oh no  sam first comes love then comes marriage  taliesin i may have hinted that we might have eloped may have hinted  sam wait youre married  taliesin i may have hinted  sam wait no you said you were betrothed to be married wait youre married oh wow you just  spilled it  taliesin silence cone /none/ of silence  sam theyre married  matt you try and yell and its making no sound it is just absolute quiet what are the rest of  you guys doing  darin i run in the corner and see if i glow again  liam keyleth and vax heard the wedding march so we had a very different silent scene over in  our spot  marisha yeah keyleth was quietly sobbing in vaxs arms and then heard wedding march and went  angry roar  laura why is that bad why was that angry  liam because we /none/ dont get that  laura oh  matt grog  sam so youre going to ruin everyone elses joy youre one of those couples  liam thank you vacation scanlan  marisha worst double date sangria partners ever  taliesin hes back ladies and gentlemen hes back and taking no prisoners  sam are you guys going on vacation we got a divorce  liam its the debbie downer snl sketch  matt grog what are you doing  travis im as uncomfortable as i can possibly be this is the worstcase scenario of my entire life  im not /none/ moving and hoping this is all over soon  taliesin i love that  travis its just endless books beyond what you can see are there chairs  laura i feel like pike wouldve comforted him  matt yeah pike comes over  travis there are chairs  matt no there arent she goes do you want to go with everyone else grog  travis i dont know do you  matt its

you guys stay there  darin im trying to see if im glowing anywhere  matt you run around for a good minute and a half and youre not seeing any sort of change  darin nothing  matt no /none/  darin can i go forward into the bookcases and look right and left to see where they lead  matt okay yeah you turn around the corner and see them disappear around the edge  darin ill continue  matt okay so you follow them as you guys are having this silent argument sprigg catches up to  you but you hear nothing sprigg as theyre all going  taliesin i just turned it off i got everyone to agree  matt okay  laura hi hows it going  darin glowing you are too whats going on with /none/ that yeah you seem to be blushing  laura its so hot in here its very hot in here  matt pike and grog catch up around the corner  travis what did you find the way out exit  sam seems like it could be this way well have to band together and go forward  travis really  sam yes  taliesin where did you get the sunglasses from  sam its glowing in here  matt the ioun stone actually is giving a faint glow similar to the glow that you see emanating  from spriggs torso /none/  sam is it glowing any more than  matt make a perception check  sam oh okay thats an eight maybe 11 i dont know do i add jack of all trades  matt you do yeah if youre not  sam i really want to know i will inspire myself and ill add a d12 that makes it 16  matt okay you start getting the sense the further you walk both your stone and sprigg are  beginning to emanate a slightly stronger glow and so you guys begin to realize that this could be  used /none/ as a path to something youre not quite sure  sam lets keep going  matt okay so everyones going behind  liam imagination clarification because a silence effect went off there did vax and keyleth hear  youre married or was that all covered by silence  matt no he crushed that in silence  liam so we heard the song but thats it good to know  matt everyone else has gone ahead and vanished into the library you guys are staying  liam noticing that were totally alone silently tug keyleth down after them  taliesin i /none/ felt that honesty was important at that moment  laura no it very much is im very glad im just surprised he didnt say anything i spoke  with him  sam he was acting nobly i wont tell anyone if you dont want me to  taliesin we had to tell them eventually  matt as youre following the stone you hear some footfalls as vax and keyleth catch up to you  guys  marisha we already know its fine  liam youre engaged you dont have to  taliesin well  laura im sorry i didnt tell /none/ you about that engagement but you know  marisha you fucking liars you fucking liars just tell us we know  laura we got married  taliesin we may have gotten married  marisha yeah

walks off in a fury  taliesin do you not know what this place means am i the only one who understands what this place  means  travis i would love to know  taliesin it all matters  laura none of us have /none/ forgotten  taliesin no i mean really it all matters so much and its not going to go away nothing goes away  marisha no it only gets filed away in some library where no one else can experience it except  for what one maybe two people ever  taliesin one and two people are all that it takes to experience something  matt an echoing voice billows out from the right side of your troupe a creaky warm matronly voice  that surrounds and almost welcomes you with the intonation of a grandmother it says nothing is  /none/ forever percival you glance off to the right and you can see theres a break in the bookcase  to your right you see the shelves have stopped ahead in this direction to reveal a circular  common area within the library where the ground domes downward into an 80footwide concave pit of  cushions and tables all standing at odd angles alongside this pit but never sliding gravity  seems to shift depending on where the dome stands these tables hold teacups and writing implements  and various other décor and things that involve binding and writing none of /none/ them slipping all of  them affixed to the table as the dome slowly comes to a central rest long spiraling streams of  silver blue and gray silk descend from the supposed ceiling that is beyond your sight and  they come down like drifting silks that push past as you enter the area  sitting 40 feet from you in the center of the dome no larger than a normal person is an older  woman with long wavy silver hair her olive skin is somewhat weathered and wrinkled around her almond  eyes but the warmth of /none/ her smile and her vibrant purple irises put you at ease immediately her  blue and white robes tumble out from her form in tendrils of parchment that snake through the  pillows like
