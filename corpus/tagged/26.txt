none	 all right this looks a little more like what i remember yeah all right hi everybody hmm so  i only got like 20 minutes but i know i said i would do this once in a while so here we are im  sitting in my office and i came to get some of my supplies because i have to do some prep for a  gnome druid a gnome cleric a gnome rogue and a human monk for my sevenyearold daughters first  game i dont have a ton of time time to do this but ill probably 
none	 try to do it like once every  other month maybe anyway questions throw them at me what are your thoughts on the 50th  episode i hope that there are 250 more i love doing the show its one of the highlights of my  week i do it with my favorite people life and work get hectic i think the reason all of us are  drawn to it is it gives us a little time to break away what is rwby would i ever consider voicing  something on rwby i dont know what it is my 
none	 kids have seen snippets of the show i think  were for my taste its a little too blue for them theyre young but i have  prescreened parts of it and shown them stuff i showed them a little bit of a goblin game the  other day because i thought theyd get a kick out of that my dagger collection is quite big ill  show you its up here my nerd shelf theres battle cap being ridden by nightcrawler but up  here out of reach of little hands are multiple daggers theres the brandnew one from 
none	 this past  episode yeah theyre all up here by the way matt mercer has totally corrupted me and ill  show you what i mean by that do do do were not done sings tune to isengard theme yeah so im  not quite as addicted as matt is but im getting there this year my kids put that back at my  desk biggest advice is a tad i dont know man i dont know i dont know if theres an answer to  that just try try your best can i come to a con in ontario 
none	 well me coming alone or us coming as  a group are two different things im probably more likely these days to go to a convention with  the group i dont go to many conventions because i dont like leaving my family that much and now i  want to go with the cr game then the problem with getting all of us to a convention is you got to  get all of us and we have crazy schedules so well definitely hit some conventions not a  million because the stars have to align but well get 
none	 out when we can i have not considered  recording my kids games theres a level of privacy id like to keep for my own life and my  family so thatll just be a home deal let me see are you going to denver comic con with the  crew if we have plans theyll be announced by the con what is my favorite mini oh gosh whats  my favorite mini do you even have to ask here he is send all your advice to him coming back  okay podcast soon yeah podcast soon sam and i 
none	 talk about it all the time even though we dont  do it we do want to do it and now i have gift certificates to swordplay la so sam and ill get  our butts over there and whack each other i guess lets see i like being a rogue in the  game yes thats what i gravitated towards most i like that vex jumped into the rogue pool i  think its really cool how she ranged for so long and then leaned into the rogue which is where she  wanted to start anyway how much 
none	 fan art in gigs do i have from the critters i dont know i mean  i could probably figure that out its a lot hello montana hello wisconsin if you asked a  question and i didnt answer it chances are i didnt see it while i was answering another  questions so feel free to toss it out again good more rogues cdoh the podcast someone was  asking about the podcast i do with sam the podcast is why critical role exists the podcast  was a show that sam and i did semiregularly a couple years 
none	 back we keep it alive every once in  a while but where we talked about being overworked busy dads with no time to do goofy  shit the two of us early in that shortlived run its still going technically but we  pulled people together to do dd and it just went from there let me see how does vax feel about  vexs new perspective on death i dont know it just happened well i mean what liam thinks is  different than what vax thinks for all these characters i dont know sometimes i feel like 
none	  weeks are going by on these episodes and whether you guys really realize it or not i think you  feel like these characters have lived with these decisions in these events the same amount of time  thats passed between episode 41 and episode 50 but were talking vex died i dont know  exactly but its been within a week still pretty fresh who i think will almost die next  oh everybody i think where matts taking us into dangerous territory now so i think the stakes are  raised what would your advice be to 
none	 someone who wanted to start playing dd just buy a players  handbook and try to find people ive done a little bit of remote as youve seen and ive  done plenty inperson remote is better than nothing inpersons better than remote just  because that split second of improvisation the delay can hurt things a little bit or slow it down  a little bit but again i would rather play remotely than not play dm advice i have no dm  advice because i am still riding with training wheels on i get a lot of requests 
none	 probably from  some people in this periscope right now saying you should you should do a periscope you should  dm a one shot with the amount of pileon that matt gets for occasional decisions and matt knows  everything he knows everything and he still gets piled on for occasional decisions i am  fudging it and winging it and making it up as i go im brand new guys and im doing it was with  a sevenyearold group and a nineyearold group so i dont think im quite ready for primetime  give me a year 
none	 to cut my teeth maybe its fun my kids love it both of my kids love it i cant  wait till romper stomper which is my nickname for my daughter romper stomper and her three  friends play on sunday i really cant wait lets see blizzcon this year again i assume i dont  know if ill officially be there but i try to go even when im not do matt colvilles tips help  you yes because ive watched matt mercer do it for three years but i havent listened to matt  mercer talk about it 
none	 for three years matt colville crystallized a lot of things that i think  that matt does as well so it was a good added perspective and that guys just sharp as a tack  and fun to listen to i met him working on the game evolve hes the writer on that game and i  directed the lions share of the voiceover on it and we just became friends even before critical  role and we talked a little bit of dd then because he knew we were playing around good guy  is dd ever stressful yeah 
none	 sometimes sometimes its stressful getting ready for the  game i can really empathize for matt just from preparing my childrens games then anytime anyone  dies because its not real its a game but lets say vex or vax were to die the faux sibling  relationship that laura and i have had for for this long is an important and meaningful part of  my life if one of us dies well reroll another character and rejoin but it wont be the same it  could grow into being something just as good but it wont be the 
none	 same its this thing that ive  had with laura for three years its just like finishing a really good book you dont want to  get to the end but then you do itll happen eventually imitates crying whose death would  hit me the hardest i dont know does the show ever feel like a job and less like a hobby  behind the scenes a little bit because were spinning a lot of plates to make it go but no  the games feel great gosh i guess ill mention this here because enough time has passed 
none	 the game  has been like therapy for me for for this entire time because my mom battled cancer for the past  couple of years and it got ugly at the end she passed away couple months ago so the funeral was  me some of you know that a funeral happened that was me so i dont want to dwell on it because  its private and im making my peace with it but this group of friends for me is just really dear  to me the game and their company has lifted me up so again 
none	 i dont want to i dont want to drop  down into despair it was hard and occasionally still is hard but its universal we all go  through it well move on from it yeah its okay thank you guys she was she was a great  woman do i intentionally try to make people cry no i dont you do know now though a lot of  what was probably feeding me under the surface for the last year or so things got i dont know  lets lighten it up what other lighter questions do you have 
none	 did you check with matt before  letting vax fall in love with keyleth yeah i talked about this on a periscope with matt and  marisha actually a month or two ago i definitely did some of you already know but in  the underdark portion show marisha did something i honestly dont remember what it was at this  point but she did something that i thought was was touching and it just put the idea in my head  i thought oh is that something you could even because for the two years at home id never 
none	 had  any notion or thought or inkling at all just because of something that happened in one episode  im going oh i wonder if you could do that the game i dont know would it be weird with that  this is a game its acting sort of sort of isnt i dont know so i talked to him about it  and i said if thats something that you dont want me to do i do not have to do it and well  sweep it under the rug forget it and even when he was supportive 
none	 and to this day like one of the  most supportive people for vaxleth with has been matt behind the scenes has told me that he loves  the story that were carving out together but i wasnt sure i wanted to do it because i didnt  know theres never been a dd show quite like this before who does publicly live on the  internet the faux relationship with half elves i dont know so i kicked around the idea in the  background and after talking to matt said maybe ill do it and maybe i wont 
none	 just put my toe in  put another toe in and then it felt like its going to be okay and so on forward i played  juliet once i pretended to be in love with a dude who whose breath smelled like ham its just  acting guys whats your wait oh boy this is going fast its going fast what was it like  shooting the new critical role opening oh my gosh it was the best the hair though the long  wig that they got somewhere and glued to my head got caught on everything it 
none	 got caught in my  mouth they got caught on the buttons of my clothes it got caught on doors as i walked  through them loved the outfit and loved seeing everybody come to life loved watching sam gyrate  i saw sam do a lot of things you havent seen yet it was the best any advice for voice acting  yes study acting learn how to act go to where the work is hit your head on the wall for ten  years and figure it out and thats the thats the truest advice there is did 
none	 you guys keep your  intro costumes pieces of it a lot of stuff was loaners from other people but i have a lot of  stuff do i enjoy dming my sons group absolutely i loved scaring their pants off im  doing the the starter set i think im going to start just making it up for my daughter after this  because its easy to remember your own stuff with the books im flipping around ill probably jump  back and forth but there is a youngish dragon in that starter set yeah scared the bejesus out 
none	 of  them i knocked one of them down im nerfing everything at least for the first year if not  for much longer no ones going to die the most theyll ever do is fall unconscious and i will  fudge the dice rolls because im not going to make nineyearold boys cry its supposed to be fun  for them let me see what was your favorite fan gifts for critmas gosh okay im not going to  answer that one just because i dont want a lot of cool stuff and a lot of touching stuff and 
none	 a  lot of handmade stuff i dont want to say this and then everyone else go aw so i guess ill  skip that one are there outtakes for the new intro probably somewhere but i dont have  access to them thoughts on grogs neardeath i dont want grog to die i dont want anybody to  die i dont want percy to die as much as theres friction between those two gosh i just didnt  roll high enough with raven queen last week guys lets see the code for free shipping is i cant  remember 
none	 what did pike learn from her insight check on vax youll have to watch to find that  out or not find out i dont know if you will is the bromance growing between vax and grog i  think the bromance has already always been there but like brothers sometimes they really lean on  each other and other times they want to punch each other do you think craven edge will come back to  haunt the group i dont know theres a lot of things that could come back to haunt us me  specifically theres a 
none	 rakshasa therere hags bad decisions in general no you cannot send me  100 pounds of fudge something came in the mail guys with this last round of critmas and  everything didnt show up in two weeks it showed up over months somebody sent food and it was  rotten it smelled bad so food probably not a good idea let me see read anything good  lately i just finished reading i didnt finish it ive been reading a comic called whats it  called harrow country its an appalachian horror comic must be harrow country how does 
none	 vax feel  about polyamory guys come on ill stay for like five more minutes by the way because i have  to draw on maps and i plan some stuff which twin is older im the older twin by five minutes i  snuck out early did i see acquisitions inc i didnt watch the most recent ive been too busy  i probably will i dont know how soon but i definitely will watch it sometime in the next  month i havent read the uncanny adventures yet are we ever going to see vax and gilmore getting 
none	  flirty again i dont know not at the same level probably anything specific i want for  critmas no guys just keep watching the show and enjoying it thats what i want for critmas just  keep watching the show and enjoying it read the hellboy books yet guys ive read the hellboy  books many times but they live down here now in that same shelf just below my vectrex do any of  you know what that is no 5 of you know what that is that was a video game machine in the  early 80s 
none	 with line graphics it was not in color the color comes from that i used to do this all  the time as a kid something to put back in  there careful theres ninjas what else do i  have up here i have the door to my old castle grayskull when i was a kid ive got some art that  you might recognize there some books theres simon and the poison kit and my dragonlance  books from my youth those old books are the lord of the rings trilogy which was the second edition  given 
none	 to me by laura and travis heres asura from asuras wrath thats made of wood theres a  little vaxleth art back there thats the tooth of a prehistoric shark which ive had since i was a  kid and thats a tie that belonged to my grandfather who was a bus driver in upstate new  york you know who that is what else theres that guy all my nerdy stuff up here which was  boxed away in our last place hey hellboy got that those two here is the beginning of my  daughters group i need 
none	 to go to a store tomorrow and get some this is my daughters gnome rogue  and this will be gnome i dont know cleric or druid nobodys painted yet heres our monk  thats one game those are my daughters for her little game this is for another game for my kids  which is just my son and my daughter and hes playing a dwarven wizard and shes playing an  elven druid then my sons game are these three guys my son playing the druid in the middle and  then weve got a rogue dragonborn and 
none	 a fire dragonborn yes i am vaxildad its true all  right im going to pick three more questions out of the ether here and then i got to go do some  stuff im going to watch for a minute and pick ones that i like but its so fast i dont know what my  ring size is i wont count that for the three are you a fan of rosencrantz and guildenstern are  dead yeah im a huge fan of that play and i think about it all the time when i work in video  
none	 games when i do pain and death sounds because one of the characters so its rosencrantz and  guildenstern for anyone who doesnt know its the two minor characters from the play hamlet  its a comedy told from their perspective so those two guys are stuck waiting to talk to the  prince waiting to talk to the king and thee queen and they meet the player king who was  an actor the head of a troupe that guy goes on and on saying im going to paraphrase but  like would you want to see a death 
none	 we do all all kinds of death we do passionate death sad  death tragic death fiery death any time im screaming and pretending get electrocuted and  pretending to get gutted i think of that character in that play im going to wait for the  next two what do i think if kynan returns i dont know i mean if youd asked me that 12  episodes or so ago im a bad opinion but theres so much bigger fish to fry im sure vax hopes  hes alive our game was like a fanciful jaunt up into 
none	 the mid 30s really and changed a little bit  but then mercer went fire breath and knocked everything everywhere i see a lot of stuff like  oh liam or vax so sad and i have no doubt that like at a certain point hell probably get  his sea legs again but its really been like a week or two since since everything went completely  upside down and many people he knows were killed and his sister died in front of him he made a  deal i think he took a gamble and tried to negotiate 
none	 with a god and it totally blew up in his  face the way i look at vax is that his life has been as much as his sister and i are tight as  hell though life has been kind of crap what happened with the dragons was the bottom dropping  out and then what happened with vex and the raven queen was what he thought was the bottom dropping  another 50 feet so i dont know guys im just doing what makes sense to me from my point of  view last question of the night 
none	 favorite moment prestream ill tell you the three moments that  stand out the most its a good cop out one is the birth of burt reynolds which was us trying to  enter a wizards tower and sam ridiculously put his finger in front of his face and talked his way  through it it was one of those moments where you could see in matts eyes like no thats not  going to work forget it thats the beauty of dungeons  dragons sam rolled a 20 and had to  roll with it so that was huge 
none	 the pike death was a huge moment that none of us will ever forget  were all like i was standing up and i felt like i was vibrating again its not real of course  its not real but we had had this relationship with ashley and this specific setup between all of  us this story if that character were to have gone we would have missed that dynamic so  that was that was huge then taking down the blue dragon who may or may not be part of the chroma  conclave we dont know either 
none	 only one person knows that when he put the mini down it was the  scariest thing wed seen on our home table and there was so much ridiculousness leading up to it  with grog nuttily dragging coin to the bag of holding then i got the how do you want to do this  on it i parkoured up a wall went shink and dragged all the way down and he just toppled and  started knocking the whole place down we had to flee and leap out of the teleportation circle we used  to come in 
dung	 so maybe those three i bet theres more that i cant remember if i really thought  about it anyway this is one of my four or fiveish periscopes ill do for the year i hope  you guys had fun i now im going to go design a cave full of spiders and drow so peace  everybody have fun its almost thursday so ill see you soon where do they put this thing
