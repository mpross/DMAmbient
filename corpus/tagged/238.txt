none	 sphere its made of all these  intricate little puzzle pieces im like see i can move it around but im not quite sure what it  does but its clearly really pretty  laura can i touch it  matt in her gnomish hands this is pretty large from your perspective it would be about that big  but for her it seems even that much bigger its a brass and golden sphere that consists of many  layers of intertwining clockwork sliding hemispheres rotating bands and strange  inscriptions its this massive complicated mess of contraption puzzle sliding 
none	 pieces  laura does it seem magical  matt make an arcana check  laura whoa thats cocked ooh  sam amazing roll  laura 19  matt 19 while she holds it out to you parts that shes not touching are shifting slightly to  where it has a clockwork feel but then you dont see any gears in the parts that are shifting  theyre sliding naturally with a very faint whir you can tell theres probably some magic involved  but its a combination of clockwork and magic  sam its just that were surrounded by gunpowder 
none	 down here so maybe not right now  deborah ive been playing with it for weeks dont worry  laura have you solved it is it a puzzle  deborah no but it can do this can i do the thing  matt you may  deborah i put my hand on one side and i pull back one ring as it pulls around across at the  same time i click another one to the side it slides around the side and  matt as the last part clicks into place theres a whir puff a burst of light 
none	 about 15 gold  coins go clanging to the ground in front  taliesin thats how you get a pinhead man nope  laughter  laura wow we have gold coins is it real gold coins is it fake gold coins like you and caleb did  matt you crack a tooth  sam didnt need that one its real  laura wow thats the coolest thing ever we just have this lame old dodecahedron  sam dont show her that  deborah oh youve got cool stuff too  sam we do  deborah i showed you my stuff

none	 to glow in a rhythmic heartbeat  fashion it has this very strong presence and the air around it has its own subtle vibration  laura if you want to look at it thats cool  deborah yeah okay i lean over it and my eyes are huge twice the size of my head not twice the  size sorry they take up half my head  travis holy shit  deborah they take up the whole top half of my face  liam thats pretty freaky too  deborah like the bigeyes pictures im looking into it and my 
none	 eyes are reflected back off the  thing i stare and i let it wash over me  matt which as you do that you feel this gravitational pull your essence drawn towards it  your peripheral blurs and darkens within you feel like youre leaning into it its no longer  an object its like a pool of water and you cross the surface and its warm past that in  the darkness you see stars an endless sea of stars drifting towards you and past you you look  ahead and you can see other little shapes you 
none	 look at them and theyre you theyre little  ghosted versions of twiggy theyre all going in different directions and some of them fade and  some of them are created two of them join and create a new light and go in a separate path in  that moment you see this single glowing warm light that appears and presents itself to you  deborah i totally reach out and touch it  matt as you reach out and put your hand towards it it merges with your hand the warmth carries  through your wrist and forearm  
none	 deborah i giggle  matt it gives this warm interior hugtype sensation as you close your eyes to relish in it  and open them again youre back on the boat with them  laura when you open your eyes ive got the thing and im totally fucking with it  laughter  laura its pretty cool huh  sam no we should really have caleb look at this hes much smarter than any of us down here  deborah i take it and i roll it across the floor  sam no beau get it get the thing get

none	 something thats not chocolate in it thats  probably for the best ill be back oh boy  matt caleb as you finish the ritual your vision crystallizes on the object as part of the  identify the information that would transition to you fails  sam oh shit  matt youve tried to identify nonmagical objects before and been like oh this isnt magical  this blocks you  marisha interesting  travis interest intensifies  liam what is this thing that you have what is this called does it have a name  deborah i dont think it 
none	 was on the card i call it my fun ball of tricks  sam happy fun ball  deborah happy fun ball  matt do not solve happy fun ball  deborah must solve happy fun ball  laura where did you get it from  liam yeah did you make it did you get it from someone else  deborah no it was sitting somewhere and i was like this is cool  liam in a museum or  deborah kind of yeah it was on a little pedestal and people were looking at it and it  had 
none	 a little card on it then i saw this guy and i was like hes a mean man and i said  sam was he the docent or something  deborah no he wasnt wearing a uniform or anything  sam why did you think he was mean what gave off that impression  deborah whispering ive seen him before  sam you know him  deborah yeah  sam oh  deborah hes a rascally man  liam whats his name  deborah his name  liam yeah  deborah sir cadigan  liam sir cadigan thats a good 
none	 name  marisha was this in port damali  deborah this was in port damali you are smart  laura do we know of any museums or places with magical items in port damali  matt make a history check low dc since youre relatively local  laura natural 20  matt theres not so much in the way of museums per se but there are collections there are  collectors and those are usually private and inviteonly through mutual merchants and nobles  and people of affluent nature but there are two auction houses where a lot of these 
none	 items are sold  and traded by these collectors one exists in port damali its called the exalted collection auction house  sam the exalted collection  laura i dont know how to spell exalted  sam you can copy off of me  liam well twiggy tell me this happy fun ball of yours what does it do  deborah well it makes money for one  liam how much money  deborah depends where you touch it  sam she made 15 gold pieces down there out of nothing  liam thats a frumpkin and a half  
none	 deborah this is true ive heard of these frumpkins im just kidding i dont know what  that is  laura thats his catoctopus owl also owl  liam sometimes a spider and other things as well this does other things besides making money what  else does this do  deborah ive played with it a lot and all kinds of little flashes and things go off  liam okay  taliesin im coming up with a veggie plate by the way the sort of things youre embarrassed  your parents bring up and putting it down  deborah 
none	 twiggy goes yum and digs right in  taliesin do you have any future plans here is there something that youre moving towards do you  have a place that youre heading a goal anything  deborah i like making friends  taliesin thats great  deborah i go around looking for friends i give my most winningest smile  travis that is heavily disarming  taliesin youre doing great then but theres a direction a cardinal direction that youre making  these friends in or do you  deborah things just sort of happen to me  matt make 
none	 a perception check  deborah sometimes i do things and then i end up somewhere i go where the wind blows  liam 21  matt as youre inspecting this there are sections of it rubiks cubeesque where you have  to rotate an area to allow another part to rotate and theres a strange order to these one for  things that should be rotating freely theres a consistent resistance to it you also notice  between the seams where all of these pieces of metal overlap where theres a slight gap if you  manage to hold it 
none	 in shadow or put shadow over it theres a very faint bluegreen glow that barely  peeks through each seam from the inside of this sphere there definitely is magic youre a smart  guy youre starting to look it over youre like some of these patterns maybe could figure it out  you do notice that a lot of the strange inscriptions on it appear to be complicated  variations of basic conjuration glyphs none that youve seen but you can see the similar shapes  the similar equationtype connection between these glyphs  liam that would explain the 
none	 money yeah  matt there is a strong conjuration element all across and very minute impossibly small  engraving across the metal  liam can i tell how old this thing looks  matt no idea all the metals pretty well kept its pretty polished theres a couple of errant  smears of chocolate caught in some aspects of it a few sticky fingerprints in some areas  travis its like the worst controller youve ever picked up at your friends house youre like oh  chocolate and cheetos and all sorts of shit  liam cheeto dust sprinkles out 
none	  laura maybe its like a piggy bank or something maybe it holds a certain amount of coins and you  have to turn it the right way can you hear coins  liam no i dont hear anything  laura maybe theyre really jammed in there good maybe its because there are so many they dont  shake around  liam is it limitless does it make money all day long  deborah yeah every time i twist it in that one way itll make money drop  liam can you show me the one way  laura how 
none	 much money do you have down in the box because thats a lot of times  deborah who needs money  liam excuse me one moment twiggy  deborah yes  liam would you show me how you make money with it  deborah i take it back and i sit down and i cross my knees i put it in my lap and its like  this giant beach ball i do this same movement where i pull it from the top around so that it  opens up and then i can use my thumb you see my 
none	 fingers are actually long and slender and  perfectly suited for this it pushes around the other side doing the same movement i did before  matt this time puff you see this flash of white light and eight gold coins clank to the  surface of the ship  taliesin oh would you look at that  liam may i see that one more time  deborah i roll it across the floor to him catch  liam from perfect memory i duplicate what she just did  matt okay puff white flash four gold coins  laura oh 
none	 its half every time  liam well i take them  travis 15 eight four  deborah i pick up the eight and i say you want those  laura oh nott already took them  deborah the eight that came out when i did it the first time  matt yeah nott already took them  deborah oh you already did okay so never mind i missed it  taliesin you mind if i take a look at that really quick  liam yeah i walk it over to him here you go  taliesin you can roll it 
none	 its all right  liam no i dont think thats a good idea  taliesin im going to try to move some stuff and see what happens  matt roll an investigation check  taliesin oh man awesome oh no damn it was almost a natural one im so sad thats a six  matt okay you find one section that shifts following suit with her and it sticks yeah  youre not getting anywhere  deborah its hard  taliesin huh thats really cool though i imagine doing that all day thatd be great yeah  i can imagine 
none	 doing that all day  deborah welcome to my world  taliesin wow rolls really well too im sorry i dont actually even remember why i asked for it  deborah i pick it up and do that basketball thing  taliesin oh thats fancy  liam what are we going to do with this little kid andor old lady  travis well i think well take her to the island and then obviously give her a chance to continue  her adventure  laura she can stay with us forever  travis well now jester look i loved kiri 
none	 as much as the next person so much just mm  laura yeah kiris wonderful  travis yeah so great but i also dont want to be responsible for anyone that cant take care of themselves  laura you can take care of yourself she made a hand can you do cool things  travis she made a what  marisha yeah it was super freaky actually  travis are we forgetting to describe things that are of import on this ship she did what  sam she has a bit of magic  deborah at this point i walk 
none	 up to you and i say oh no i walk up to you i say how many  tickles does it take to make an octopus laugh  liam oh no dont you dare  deborah ten tickles and i cast hideous laughter  matt make a wisdom saving throw  liam its an 18  deborah so it doesnt work but i go funny huh  liam yeah im not a happy guy  travis i wanted to see a caleb laugh so bad  matt i know  travis oh my god like some horrible crash  deborah 
none	 its an octopus joke  liam awkward forced laughter  travis okay so shes not entirely invalid  laura fjord what are you doing  travis what  sam hes assessing his new crew this is what a professional captain does  travis thats right jester you would not want guilt over bringing in sweet twiggy here to what  could be certain doom thats what we do we seek out certain doom  deborah sounds fun  travis yeah  sam just to allay some of our fears were people actively pursuing you and chasing you when you got 
none	  onto this boat and if so how many  travis tell the truth now  deborah oh i always tell the truth mom and dad said very important to always tell the truth  sam may they rest in peace  deborah thank you to be perfectly honest yes there were quite a few people chasing me but im  super fast not really im just really sneaky  sam do you think they might still be chasing or tracking you or wanting to find you  deborah hadnt really thought about it  sam ooh thats not great 
none	  travis well you said you got that nice little sphere there anything else we should know about maybe  deborah fun ball of tricks  travis fun ball of tricks yes i will not forget again anything else we should know about that  people might wish they had instead of you  deborah thats all ive got right now but i do have sticky fingers i hold them up and theyre  covered in chocolate  matt whos got the sphere  travis caduceus had it last  deborah hes had it weve been playing and i twirled 
none	  taliesin there was a twirl and it went back  liam do you have any prospects any longterm plans goals where do you see yourself in a year  let alone a week from now  deborah hanging out with you guys  laura yes best answer ever  travis oh great  liam what about kiri  laura what about kiri  liam what about nott  laura what about nott were all friends what about cali we all love each other so much  marisha im a little confused at your implication as well  taliesin im 
none	 going to detect magic to get a  deborah on me  taliesin yeah  deborah detect magic  matt there is a powerful magical essence emanating from that sphere  taliesin okay no ones got anything sitting on her  matt a different kind of magic but comparable to the dodecahedron in some ways  taliesin okay same vibe  matt yeah and there is two faint magical auras on her person  sam whispering shes holding  deborah would he know could he be able to tell  matt he would be able to tell if there was 
none	 something magical on your person he wouldnt know  any more than that  sam caleb would know  travis jester im going to leave you in charge of twiggy all right weve got to make for this  island you keep an eye on her i dont want to see any chocolate thumbprints in my quarters you  understand twiggy  deborah done  travis okay  taliesin those were all over it then  travis all right youre in charge  laura hey dont steal from us okay  deborah nope  laura good see were good  
none	 marisha as fjord gets the boat going i follow after fjord  sam im going to seeing as how she said there are folks chasing her as we get going again go  up to the crows nest and do a scan with my awesome perception and see if theres any boats  trailing us  matt make a perception check as you clamber up to the top of the crows nest and glance over the horizon  sam 11  matt looking off in the horizon you currently dont see any ships that are immediately pushing  into the 
none	 territory youre following fjord  marisha do you need help getting the boat ship sailing ship moving whatever  travis yeah of course feel free to lend a hand  marisha am i the only one thats not beguiled by her charms twiggy  travis no youre not the only one i dont trust that shit  marisha me neither anything that cute  travis that saccharine yeah you need some salt to balance that shit out  marisha have you ever noticed that pomeranians are the nastiest dogs youve ever met  travis whats a pomeranian  marisha theyre 
none	 poofy theyre super adorable theyll eat your face  sam i run over to them and say oh twiggy just did this thing with her tongue where she made it  into a circle it was really great youve got to see it later  deborah not everyone can do it  sam its really cool  travis maybe we throw her overboard  marisha thats a solid option like a plan d  travis when you were down there with her did she try any shady shit  marisha she definitely has some magic capabilities she cast this illusion 
none	 that made her  hand look like it was extending i think it was supposed to be cute but you know that uncanny  valley it was a little weird its unsettling  travis right okay  marisha hey i have another question  travis yes  marisha since youre captain now right youre captain  travis apparently  marisha will you train me to be your first mate  travis yes yes i will  marisha really okay  travis are you up for it lot of responsibility youve got to like cosign for the boat and shit  
none	 marisha yeah okay  travis shake on it  marisha deal  travis all right first mate  matt it stings you a little bit your wounds still fresh  travis ah fucking cobalt grip  marisha sorry again for being a dick i think ive been a little bit on edge with the boat  travis its all right im kind of immune now i just take it  marisha its really just a kneejerk it wouldve happened if it was anybody you couldve been a  scarecrow and i wouldve been like fuck off bro  travis i 
none	 feel so special  marisha okay lets go  matt you do also know as youre heading into legal territory under the clovis concord that you  have a ship that is known and labelled as the squalleater as damaged as it is  laura oh no  sam change the name  travis burbling thats my call burbling forward deck  sam the squallbeater the balleater  laura the balleater  travis we need to change it to the balleater as quickly as possible nott i need you to hang over  the side of the ship with a 
none	 paintbrush  liam thats going to draw attention to us  travis  inches above the water and change the name of the ship to the balleater  marisha it actually works pretty easily you just add a line and then you paint over that  travis can you do it  deborah i say dont worry about it dont worry again this hand comes off of my own hand i flick  it and it flies off and it comes and picks up the paintbrush i lean over the side and it goes down  and starts to change 
none	 your title for you without having to risk his life  laura wow she can paint too  matt roll a dexterity check for me  sam i never remember to use it like that  matt this is dexterity to see how well you can paint it while upside down  deborah natural 20  taliesin this is apparently a mary poppins musical act  matt apparently not only does she manage to entirely erase the beginning of the word squall  but has beautifully calligraphied the b of ball to where it looks almost like a set of 
none	 balls if  interpreted that way it has this nice sparkly border around it now its like singing  balleater its almost got jazz hands  deborah shadowed and decor  marisha i agree with caduceus  taliesin calligraphys very impressive  liam is this regular paint or the magic paint  matt this is regular paint  liam thats good  laura as a side note i am hiding my magic paint like whoa  matt good to know  deborah it comes back up and it paints a mustache on me and i go arr  travis on 
none	 who  deborah on me  travis i thought it was on me i was like yelps  sam wow that was very impressive  laura thats really good thats really really good  sam youve made some allies today with that  travis youre a temporary pirate now  deborah gasping my eyes get even bigger  travis its a great honor dont mess it up what were you saying  laura we should take the sail down  travis yeah i was going to say we probably took stock of any colors we have that we can run 
none	 up  that arent associated with the squalleater  matt there are no colors on deck that arent associated with it the only colors that are on  deck were the colors that the ship previously sailed  travis we still have some fire damage on the boat though were going to play that our flag  was burned  laura our flag was burned by pirates  sam we could paint a new flag with your brush  laura yeah but thats a really big amount of paint to use for a flag  matt make a history check 
none	 caleb  sam okay are you ever going to use that paint  laura yes i am  liam 21  matt you keep thinking on that sphere youve read about similar objects especially the  conjuration aspect of it that are used as focuses similar to a bag of holding to maintain  and contain things for powerful mages its construction makes you feel like its very old  probably precalamity  travis get the fuck out of here what thats so old  matt precalamity is 800 years and theres a whole era of very powerful magic  
none	 travis is it only 800 i thought it was 8000  matt no 800 years ago was the calamity or a little over 800  taliesin caleb just a second just thought you should know theres a couple interesting magical  auras on our new friend i thought it would be impolite to point it out or to dispel anything i  try and respect peoples personal intentions but if you feel the urge to do a little identify at  some point that may not be a bad idea i dont know just to make sure that everything thats 
dung	  there is meant to be there  liam noted  taliesin im not getting a bad vibe off of this one just a lot of sugar being held up for a  while in a dark confined space can make people a little loopy  liam i am also worried about traveling around well i am not a fan of the name balleater for  this boat  taliesin no i also agree i think it draws an unfortunate amount of attention  laughter  liam on a similar note i feel like our new miniature friend will also 
none	 draw attention  taliesin thats fair thats a very fair point  liam maybe ill have a chat with her get us on the same page  taliesin i dont know if shes necessarily going to listen to you shes a little  liam sometimes people listen to me  taliesin thats very true you do have an air of authority you do right now im feeling really  awkward about this whole conversation purely from your face your face has done nothing and now im just  liam well it takes two to tango my palms are sweating at 
none	 the moment  taliesin that weirdly makes me feel better ill disengage straight up then  liam i am going to find our little friend  taliesin thats fine im going to go over and cook something  laura do you want to say were up in the crows nest is that a good place to be or would you  like to be somewhere else i know youve been below deck for a very long time  deborah ive climbed up on those things and im swinging back and forth on the ropes and the hooks  on the 
none	 main mast wind in my hair  matt as this is happening and youre approaching caleb you see orly sitting there with his giant  tortle arms looking up with his craned tortle neck and going hmm  liam how long has she been doing that for  matt far too long  laura im in the crows nest going twiggy twiggy seriously come back to the crows nest though  deborah five more minutes  travis oh no  liam bitte a moment of your time just to have a chat you can keep swinging but could you swing 
none	  a little lower  deborah i jump its really light and beautiful almost like i couldnt fall at all you see me  grabbing on the hooks like a little monkey i fly down the mast and jump down so i can sit right  next to you  liam all of that movement is making me nervous  deborah dont be nervous  liam welcome to the mighty nein  deborah counting thats weird  liam its sort of a running gag but its our name  deborah i love gags  liam you know if youre going 
none	 to be traveling with us for a while i have a few suggestions  deborah okay  liam so three the first of them is probably when we get to land it will be better if you kept a  low profile because we sometimes cut a rough swathe wherever we go and i cant guarantee that  someone is not familiar with us so i would hate for any danger to you know best not to call attention  deborah no more friends dont make any more friends  liam well just stick with us for a little while 
none	 and see how that works out  deborah i love that idea  liam okay the second suggestion is that you should meet my cat frumpkin  deborah i put my hand over trixie in my pocket  liam whats the matter  deborah does your cat like squirrels  liam oh my cat is very well trained and will not hurt your squirrel i promise  deborah so is trixie as trixie yeah im real good as twiggy sorry its me saying it  its not trixie its me saying it as trixie im crate trained  liam i 
none	 scarcely know what to do with you well get to the cat in a minute i will so gladly  introduce you to my cat because im very fond of him and love for people to meet him but before we  do that the third suggestion is and i cast suggestion i suggest you share any strange or  unique or arcane objects or things even that are of threat with me just so i know that we are safe  matt make a wisdom saving throw  deborah i have advantage on this  liam thats rough  
none	 deborah 14  liam 16  matt so yeah it takes effect  deborah no worries i scramble up to you and i try to sit in your lap  liam oh how about you just sit next to me  deborah i lean my head on your shoulder and i say okay so i have this little pouch out of my  bag again theres feathers and fleece and all this sand and stuff im pulling out i pull out a  little cube and say this is my achoo dust  liam oh put that back in your 
none	 pocket  deborah it goes back in my pocket and then i go you want to see something cool  liam always  deborah i go and lift up my cloak and put it over my head as i do that another little twiggy shows  up right next to me and when i move she moves i go look and we do a little dance for you  liam i put one of my hands through their heads  deborah one of them yes its an illusion  liam oh thats good  deborah yeah people have a real 
none	 hard time getting me  liam yeah im not going to try to do that  deborah yay  liam is there anything  laura im watching from the crows nest  matt every time she goes into that pouch and opens it up you can still see taking up a large  portion of it massively like a distended backpack is the slightly shifting clockwork of  that sphere  deborah i take my hood off and go neat huh  liam yeah the neatest do you have anything that is harmful or is it just those two things 
none	  including your puzzle ball  deborah i say well these can do some damage  travis your hands  liam yeah okay well  marisha these are registered deadly weapons  deborah dont mess with me  liam for what its worth i apologize and heres my cat i turn frumpkin the first night on this  boat into a cat and use the last of my supplies so its frumpkin the cat right now thats frumpkin  deborah thats frumpkin  liam he is best cat  deborah can i pet  liam of course hes already climbing 
none	 up her shoulder  deborah i pet him and its like ooh i love your cat ooh that tickles  liam i tell him to do a blep so he just does this  deborah and twiggy goes back  liam all right youre okay you can hang out with frumpkin for an hour  laughter  deborah goody i sit on the floor and frumpkin and i start booping each other on the nose  liam i go and sit like 20 feet away and watch to make sure everything is on the up and up  deborah and 
none	 thats eight hours on suggestion  liam yeah  deborah okay  matt well until the directed activity is completed  liam well if shes shown me everything of arcane nature  deborah ive shown you all the magic stuff on my person  matt then yeah so suggestion has worn off  deborah i go pftt i know that trick i give you a high five down below  laughter  matt most awkward onship high five ever  liam were going to force perspective this shit as gandalf hello twiggy  matt as your new compatriot for this 
none	 journey seems to have for the time being accepted into  your wings is there anything else you want to do  travis ill be showing beau the ropes firstmanning the ship  matt all right so youre getting that situated  taliesin ill be finishing up some stuff in the kitchen im going to run by caleb one more time  to have a chat about what he saw just mention weve got two magical spheres on board the ones  like a clock thing  liam maybe three  taliesin technically three  liam one is in fjords 
none	 gooch  taliesin i was thinking its like a clock maybe that means time i dont know if times passing  or something  liam oh im very curious about it i would like very much to see if shes willing to sell it or  part with it somehow  taliesin or at least let you take a look at it for a while or something maybe i dont know it  gives me a chill not sure  liam i was not paying attention has anyone said how long it is until we reach land  taliesin and 
none	 liam three days  matt from this point a little over three days  liam maybe shell lend it to me  laura im going to teach twiggy all about the traveler hes pretty cool  deborah cool  matt so the traveler she explains to you in a very truncated way is the being that she worships  but talks with and taught her a bunch of things and theyve been a friend anything else you want  laura i feel like he would like you a lot you know because number one he likes people that can  
none	 be sneaky because its fun right and you can be sneaky  deborah its the most fun ever  laura also he has a cloak just like you have a cloak really cool also he always kept me  company i know you had a lot of time by yourself right so did i and he always kept me company  deborah is he like as trixie trixie  laura as trixie hes not quite like trixie hes more like highpitched the traveler  deborah the traveler  laura and he comes and hes over here  deborah oh thats

none	 you start shifting it a bit and as you turn a little cylinder extends a  little bit and you press on it and you hear poof theres another burst but this one has a  dull blue color to the burst of light suddenly four cut jade pieces of stone appear and hit the ground  deborah whoa it never did that before  liam well you just have to tinker with it a little bit holy cats  laura what this is the best thing ever  liam i pick up the jade  matt each ones worth

none	 helping 22  matt from that place where you had it you find one of the other grinding bands it felt like  sandpaper when you tried to move it is now moving smooth like it has no resistance so you  twist that one around and as you do you hear this clicking sound it fits into place theres  another piece around that you hear give this very faint creaking sound you look for it and you  find it and theres a little knob you turn the knob and as you do another section opens up on 
none	  one side and then theres this flash and you look over on the ground and in the middle of the wood  theres a black hole about a foot wide  laura oh this is definitely pinhead stuff  deborah whoa i pick up the cat and i walk over  liam no have you ever seen this before  deborah no this is all new to me  liam we dont see through  matt no you look and its just black  travis its just black  sam we cant see the next deck  matt no

none	 least we need to put a plank of wood over this so that nobody falls into it  matt foomph its gone  laura oh it only lasts for a little bit i wonder where it would have taken us was it big  enough for us to go through  travis like a personsized hole  matt it was about a foot across so a smaller person maybe but a lot of you guys it would have  been a tight squeeze not caduceus at all  liam fjord first mate beauregard im glad youre here i want to 
none	 introduce you to the new  honorary member of the mighty nein  travis oh my goodness you must have proved yourself greatly  marisha welcome to the mighty nein  deborah why thank you well be the mighty ten no thats not how it works  travis we vote on the name every couple of months but its going to be a while  deborah oh  travis well she needs a hat  liam yep the bigger the better  travis every pirate needs a hat  laura do you want one of avantikas hats  deborah are

none	  of this its opened up another stage  liam its getting more pokey  matt a little bit  liam less smooth and spherical  matt less smooth and there are more elements that are starting to protrude a bit  liam does this thing every day sort of shrink back in on itself or do you ever slide it back  together or has it been getting more complex over time  deborah ive never gotten it further than that first stage so i dont know  liam oh okay  marisha do it again  liam it 
none	 took me a few minutes to  deborah as trixie do it again  liam oh okay  matt all you have to do is press on that to trigger it again  liam to press oh clicks  matt poof that hole appears again  travis same size  matt same size in a slightly different location  marisha nott  sam what  marisha do you want to go in a hole  laura gasps what if the hole disappears while nott is still in it  travis im sure itll be fine  deborah ill take out 
none	 my lantern and i strike it so that its lit i attach it to a string i go  and i start to lower it down the hole and see if it does anything  matt as the lantern hits the darkness the darkness consumes it like water once the lantern  is submerged within the darkness no light you dont even see the lantern  deborah then if i pull it up  matt still lit  laura i feel like we should put our head through it  travis i think so too but youve got to do 
none	 it quick because its going to stop real quick  marisha its still a foot  matt mmhmm  travis do it do it  laura but do it really fast  sam im not doing that no way youre crazy  matt its gone it only lasts about a minute  liam you could have been decapitated doing that  sam yes thank you  marisha well he says it lasts a minute  travis yeah its been about twice a minute each time  matt each time its lasted about a minute yeah  marisha when weve timed 
none	 it  matt both times its been approximately the same length of time close to a minute  liam keen mind nah its a minute  travis jester and beau boulderparchmentshears figure out whos going to put their head in and  help us see it  sam why do we care whats in the oh man  laura you have to do it  marisha all right ill do it  liam are you readied  marisha yeah  travis ill grab onto her britches as shes doing it  taliesin im finally walking in because everybody has vanished

none	 put goggles on and your face as he pushes you down further you hit something its soft  you pull back a bit and look and theres a pile of objects there  laura take them  marisha i grab a few  matt okay as you pull her out before she slips  taliesin oh yep im on it  marisha pull me back  matt as youre pulling back a few things start tumbling out of this thing you grab them and pull  them in you pull out and she emerges you have this pile of reddish 
none	 cloth and a strange metal  object of some kind and a couple other things you pull the rest of them out thats dangling in  as soon as it does the hole closes  taliesin wow thats cool do that again  laura oh my god what if its a safe in another dimension  liam what did you see could you see  matt you look at it first off  travis do i look the same  marisha what is my face  matt shes pulling her tongue out  travis start speaking in latin  matt 
none	 first off you hear impacts as two boots fall out of this pile of clothes she has these  really nice leather boots that are fur on the top they hit the ground theres a metal rod that  looks like a staff that you hold and pull there the other thing is a bundle of this really heavy  warm wintercoat velvet material its a deep crimsonred color with golden trim on it as you  unravel it theres an embroidered symbol across the back of it thats the symbol right there  laura do we recognize it  
none	 matt you do not you guys have never seen this before  laura thats definitely an h with a bow  sam or it could be the tail of a whale or something  liam beauregard let me see this  matt i mean youre looking at it there theres not much more to it than that  liam but its on the coat yeah  travis theres a watermark up here i can see it its amazing  matt that watermark is part of the paper its not part of the actual symbol  travis oh i dont believe 
dung	 matt i dont believe it  taliesin the fourth wall lies  liam its the coat it is boots and the third thing was  matt its a metal staff you look at it and its a metallic staff about three to four feet long  it has a seam in the middle of it like its two pieces joined  laura was there anything else in there  marisha it was super dark i hit a barrier it felt like it was a barrier of stuff  laura what if this ball is somebodys treasury or something  sam 
none	 or if its their pink haversack  laura yeah thats what i mean theyve been storing stuff in it  liam its a vault  laura gasps its a vault  marisha oh shit  travis weve got to figure out what all this stuff is first i mean just so its not a pole  and a pair of shitty boots  liam here hold this i give her the doohickus and i say i need 30 minutes i gather up all this  stuff and i walk with it very happily  laura i follow him and sit 
none	 next to him  matt well say for the sake of brevity the boots are not magical theyre just really warm  boots the cloak is not magical its just a very warm cloak  travis with that symbol on the back  matt with the symbol on it the staff is faintly magical and what it is is it acts like a hand  warmer you take the two parts and you slide them together and it clicks the metal emanates enough  heat to warm the hands of whoevers holding it this appears to be a set of 
none	 travel gear for  whoever once might have had this  liam i also use an additional ten minutes to touch the coat and cast comprehend languages on  this see if it says anything  matt and liam its a name  matt yep halas  sam what is it  matt halas halas  liam well we have just robbed halas  travis have any of us heard that name before  matt disagreement mmmm  marisha do we know what language that name hails from  matt it seems to have some roots in zemnian but its 
none	 a divergent element so a name that hasnt  been used in a long long time kind of like  travis archibald or  matt yeah like melchor things that are old historical names in fact roll a history check  liam old magic natural one  matt it slips from you theres something youre like hmm  travis beau when you hit that buffer did it feel hard and solid or was it soft and earthen  matt your face hit the cloak you were like impact into this pile of soft heavy material  marisha it was cloak 
none	 and stuff  travis did you find a portal into somebodys wardrobe  marisha it was cold in there i dont know hes saying that the staff heats his hands and there  was a cloak maybe wherever this haversack was from  matt a couple of ball bearings fall out of the cloak from what was dropped in there earlier  laura oh cool  deborah i collect them back and put them in my bag  travis well at least its the same place each time so if it does close off we at least know  how 
none	 to find you  sam sure why are you looking at me when you say that  travis youre going in  sam no im not going in  travis yeah youre really good at finding stuff  deborah ill go in if you dont want to go ill go or ill go with you want to go together  sam into somebodys laundry bag  deborah why not  sam all right  marisha it feels like someone was raptured and were stealing their stuff thats what it feels like  liam just roll with it though  sam 
none	 ill take a big swig and get ready  travis when she was yelling on the other side of the portal was there any sound that came between  the two between the portal nothing  matt nothing  laura okay im going to tie this rope around your waist okay then this rope is going to tie  around your waist now so you guys are tied together then were going to hold it up top  okay you have a minute if you start to go too long were going to pull you up  travis or if 
none	 youre ready to come back tug twice on the rope  deborah i hold his hand if hell let me  matt her hand  deborah her hand sorry i hold her hand if shell let me  sam of course i squeeze it way too hard  liam okay are you ready  sam yes  liam eins zwei drei click  sam yelling  matt one by one you guys jump in one after the other and you both tumble in and hit a floor  deborah can we see anything  matt looking around you both have 
none	 darkvision because gnomes its a cylindrical chamber it  feels almost like a natural rock interior  deborah doors out anything like that any exits  matt no its just a little pocket  deborah what do we see what stuff  matt you see two other ball bearings you left behind and thats it it looks like youve  cleaned out what was in this pocket  sam and deborah tug tug  matt you guys emerge  deborah that was so much fun  sam it was crazy down there the lights the monsters  travis really  
none	 sam it was insane  travis youre so brave  sam it was a parade of horrors  travis youre full of shit arent you  sam yeah there was nothing down there  laura that was it  sam no it was nothing but its a lot of space so if we wanted to store something for  safekeeping its a good spot to do it  matt the area on the sphere where youve been pressing this button you look and its freed  another area as well that can continue to be solved  laura yeah do 
none	 it  travis as a note the previous function of the sphere we can access or is it one function at a  time as it changes  matt as it looks right now you need to shift it back to use a previous function each thing you  slide unlocks the next use but it closes off the previous one until you reverse it  liam which i am memorizing  marisha i go to fjord youve told us about the halas thing  liam yeah sure  marisha is this perhaps something to do with sir cadigan and 
none	 port damali stuff do you know a  cadigan would i recognize the name hadigas  matt you wouldnt  matt cadigan  marisha no halas  matt oh halas you roll a history check too  marisha to see if this is his old stash  matt yeah roll a history check  marisha thats absolutely horrifying ten  matt if they did teach it you probably werent paying attention that day at the archive unfortunately  deborah would i know it in relation to sir cadigan the person i took it from  matt roll a history check 
none	  sam come on deborah  liam somebody come on three rollers  deborah 17  matt no none at all youve never heard the name halas before anywhere in port damali or in any of  your travels especially in relation to sir cadigan  deborah i turn to everybody and at first i go straining nope sir cadigan was a big old  meanie but i dont think he had anything to do with this  marisha i mean youve mentioned sir cadigan being a big old meanie several times what did he  do did you witness 
dung	 something  deborah straining cant remember but i think i might be like this because of him  laura like what  sam adorable  deborah as trixie a little weird as twiggy sorry she talks sometimes  sam he made you socially awkward  deborah i remember it was really dark and it was really long i had nobody to talk to so i made up  all these people to talk to finally when i got out wow is it a big beautiful world im so glad  i met you guys  sam you were trapped somewhere 
none	  deborah somewhere  liam were you in this ball  deborah i dont think so it didnt look like where i was all i know it was that big old  meanie sir cadigan who put me in there  laura and liam what did he look like  deborah hes twice my size hes very skinny he wore this big ring with a green gem on it i  remember because he used to stick his fingers through the bars to scare me  travis howd you escape  deborah i was really tricksy because i would sit 
none	 there and i would think and i would practice all  of my tricks i was able to get him to watch my trick he thought that i ran down that way but  really i was hiding in the back i snuck out and i ran the other direction i was able to run run  run ive been running ever since  sam this was in port damali  deborah yes  travis it sounds real familiar  liam why dont you all take ten steps back and well see what this next hinge does  taliesin im 
none	 excited  matt okay you all step back about ten paces anyone want to help or you going with your  standard roll  liam oh investigation for it yeah  matt yep  liam investigation 21  matt okay that hole appears again youre unable to get past that point youre hitting a barrier  and youre clicking it forward theres something about the puzzle thats escaping you you feel  like youre not quite youre on the cusp  deborah can i help him  matt if you want to try it again  deborah just try it 
none	 again okay yeah ill try it again i come up and i say ive been  practicing let me try  matt if you want to either you both can roll individually or one of you can roll with  advantage as youre helping the other  liam i would give me the advantage probably  deborah i have a plus ten investigation  liam oh shit  travis i have a plus ten  liam im at plus eight yeah sure  matt as you hand the sphere over holding the places twiggy goes in and takes hold of 
none	 it both  of you together begin to try and rotate and figure it out  deborah i squint my eyes and i look at it real hard and i roll a 28  matt at that point both together twiggy finds this small rotating piece on the very edge that  turns and turns as it does another cylindrical sphere slowly emits from it like youre rotating  a pencil lead that pushes out  deborah it takes three fingers to do it at the same time  matt you twist it and you push it in and it 
none	 actually pushes in about an inch and then clicks  inside recessed as that happens a top part opens up a little bit caleb you take that and  rotate it as it clicks into place you hear rising tone whoosh flash of green light  travis green lights never good  matt fills the entire chamber thats where were going to go to break  yelling  travis and they never come back  deborah and we never return  matt well that was a fun campaign guys it was a lot of fun  taliesin english accent dont

dung	 well get this sent to you asap so a flash of green  light energy fills the chamber as it subsides you all take a second to blink as the light is  dimmer than it was on the inside of the ship looking about you are in a very dark chamber  youre no longer on the ship  deborah all of us  matt all of you except for yasha because she was not nearby this chamber is somewhat  triangular but the corners are curved at each of these walls between each curvature there is a  
none	 banner hanging about 12 feet off the ground on a brass rod the banner hangs almost to the floor  you see four pillars a little closer inside the chamber each banner is a different color the  ceilings about 15 feet high and there are two corpses on the floor nearby both longdead and  mummified their skin paperthin and pulled against their bones their faces twisted in  horror you see the light gray stone walls and where these banners are there are two on the side  parallel to each other and two on the other there 
none	 is a red a green a blue and a black each of  these banners has gold embroidery down the sides and a gold embroidered symbol in the middle the  same symbol as the cloak that you found  deborah did the happy ball of fun tricks come with us  matt nope  laura oh no  liam i cast mage armor  travis all four symbols are the same on all four banners  matt mmhmm  marisha it was hala  travis and matt halas  deborah exits do we see any exits  matt no 
none	  deborah pedestals are there anything on them  matt there are four pillars they are smooth they appear to be either decorative or  loadbearing but there is nothing about them that catches your eye if you want to take a closer  look you can make an investigation check if you want  sam is the ground dirt gravel or stone  matt stone as well  deborah 12  matt pretty solid and featureless  taliesin the two corpses what can we ascertain about them are they wearing clothing  matt they are both wearing clothing  
none	 deborah naked  taliesin nudists get trapped in here all the time  matt theres not much dust on them which means either its fresh or not a lot of dust to have collected  liam theres no entrances or exits  matt from what you can see none make a medicine check  laura does it smell like death in here  matt theres a faint aura or a faint scent but either these corpses do not emanate a lot of  smell or it has faded in time  deborah i send my mage hand out to move

none	 reveals to be a statue that is embedded in the wall behind it up  on hind legs with claws in front you see a dragon made of stone carved wings blending up into the  stone behind it its mouth open its eyes these very bright sapphires embedded in its head  immediately as it opens up the mouth lights up blue make a dexterity saving throw and caleb and nott  deborah i also have evasion  matt correct  deborah not good dont do it  matt what did you roll  deborah i rolled a ten

none	 corpse on the ground staring off its eyes  dull and the pupils smoky and gray breathes in its chest seems to inhale and it holds the air  there awaiting your questions  taliesin im so sorry friend you have one more task to perform before we can let you rest what  killed you  matt the wailing creature  taliesin the wailing creature what color was the curtain the wailing creature hid behind  matt onyx black  taliesin good to know how did you end up here  travis yes thank you taliesin  matt we 
none	 had found an object and toyed with it  sam just like us  liam did any of his friends get out  taliesin whats the name of that  sam halas  taliesin what does the name halas mean to you  matt nothing  taliesin well thats no help  matt four questions youve got one more  laura oh god  sam did anyone escape  taliesin do you know how to get out of here  matt no that final bit of trapped air in the lung escapes and it falls to stillness once more  
none	 taliesin im going to give him a little pop and seed him for later  matt okay so youre casting decompose on him  taliesin mmhmm  deborah nice trick  taliesin thank you well that was a little helpful  sam it was a lot helpful so we know blue bad black bad  deborah probably green and red bad  sam well maybe one of them is a good maybe one of thems a way out of here  deborah maybe  laura you should put on the robe did you put on the robe i can help 
none	 you put on the robe  travis no im trying to put it on does it fit  matt its a little tight on you but it fits youre slender for a halforc  travis im fucking fit okay  matt you can be fit and slender  taliesin maybe theyre all bad  liam hey man you let strength be the dump stat  deborah we could stand out of the way and my mage hand could open them all if we felt like there  could be  laura the wailing creature could  deborah yeah it wouldnt 
none	 matter where we stood  laura yeah but he is in line with the wailing creature  liam i have an idea i can make a magical hut that nothing can pass through  travis that is an excellent way to try and figure out what the fucks going on in here  liam i am going to begin to take the minute to cast leomunds tiny hut in the center of the room  matt okay  travis an observation deck  deborah in the center of the room okay  laura ooh the center  marisha like one 
none	 of those bomb shelter walls  liam its a tenfoot radius and everyone is allowed to enter and exit  matt a tenfoot radius would be a bit bigger than that so that would be the tenfoot radius  laura can we all fit inside of it  liam absolutely but i have to stay in the center of it where it is safe  sam but someone needs to step out of it in order to trigger the other  deborah well can i send mage hand through it  liam you can stick your hand through the barrier 
none	 and cast mage hand and pull back in yeah  matt so everyone is moving into it  laura i want to stay still as much away from a lineup as we like in front of the things  matt theres not a whole lot of space there  travis you know its just a thought but if we have to open two of these that are facing each  other at the same time so they destroy each other well probably have to drop that down  liam this is impervious to yeah  travis well get there  
none	 liam well get there we can experiment because this is impervious  travis i like it  taliesin so we already know what two of these are  deborah right  marisha what if you unleash the wailing creature and we have to deal with it  liam it cannot come in here  travis what about sound  deborah how long does it last  liam oh hours that is a good point although i have a decent supply of honeycomb we could knead  it up and make earplugs for ourselves  travis that is really resourceful  
none	 deborah and i have gum  liam thats just as good or better you are clever  deborah yeah thank you  sam sure  travis where did her gum come from  marisha its survival  sam well lets do some honeycomb then  travis yeah yeah yeah  marisha ill take the gum im not proud  taliesin i feel like i was told as a child not to put things in my ears but i guess im doing this  laura im going to soften it up with my mouth  liam before and after okay  
none	 taliesin i wonder whats behind green  travis yeah me too  deborah okay  travis do it  deborah all right ill sneak over to that side so i can see it and im going to put just my hand  outside of the area of the hut  travis you dont need that hand you got another one  deborah it has vocal components do i need to lean my head out  matt dont make this the second time ive taken a hand of yours  deborah but my new hand is so cool  matt sorry 
none	 so  deborah if theres a vocal component only i have to be able to hear it do i need to stick my  head out  matt as far as you know it doesnt affect you in a volume or noise way  deborah okay so i whisper something and i move my hand and that silvery spectral hand comes off  and it goes forward toward the green i pull my own hand back and get back into the space and i  tell it to push the green flag aside  matt you have to move over 
none	 here probably to get into range as you pull back the green tapestry  laura im going to crouch even in the thing  matt you crouch down okay as you pull it back you see a statue behind it that looks to be some  horribly mutated humanoid creature its body is bulbous and covered in sores its neck is swollen  like a toads its mouth and jaw open with rows of teeth all made of stone as it pulls back this  gaseous green fume spews from its mouth that fills the chamber around it about half 
none	 the chamber  begins to fill with this before it dissipates but it does not cross the boundaries of the hut  travis ooh shit  deborah red  taliesin sound a beam theres a screech theres a gas  deborah well light sound gas  sam smell sound vision  taliesin i dont know what goes next  matt what are you doing next  deborah should i try it  laura do the red maybe its fire  deborah i move over to be in line with the red and i stick my hand out and it flies 
none	 out the  spectral hand i pull back into the safety and it pushes aside the red  matt it pulls aside the red behind it you see emerge a wooden door of redpainted material and  the similar symbol of halas painted across the surface  travis red doors are bad  sam thats the way out  deborah should the mage hand try to open it you guys i can send my hand to try and open it  liam we are still safe in here yeah i think so  deborah captain fjord  travis proceed  
none	 deborah sweet i whisper and i direct it a little bit it comes down and it grabs a knob a handle  matt there is a handle there  deborah a handle and its going to turn  matt clicking its locked  laura hmm ooh fjord look in your pockets  travis why  laura of the red robe look in the pockets of the red robe  deborah i call it back to me i pull out of my purse a little set of tools on a ring and i give  it to the hand and whisper 
none	 it off again to go see if it can pick the lock  matt the hand hovers across roll an ability check adding your dexterity modifier and your  proficiency modifier  deborah my thieves tools thats a 29  laura whoa  sam i dont have to do shit im just going to sit there drinking  matt it takes a few minutes this is an intricate lock as you watch the hand finish with the third  tool that is being held between the mystical pinkie you hear a slight clink like a spring  snapped or moved 
none	 the front of the door here bursts into flame burning out in the area it  burns solid for a good 30 seconds surrounded by flame all of you are being lit by this youre  wincing from the heat you feel you should be feeling but its all being held at bay by the  huts boundaries eventually the flames die out the door tapestry both untouched  deborah i pull the hand back to me and i take my keys ow back in my pouch  matt yeah theyre very hot  travis can i search the pockets 
none	 of the red coat  matt sure make an investigation check  taliesin feels a bit extreme  sam deep pockets  laura natural one  travis seven  matt there are no pockets on the robe  travis no pockets  sam that door is still closed  matt yeah its a heavy cloak if you will  sam so theres no way in or out and every door is bad  travis well we havent pulled the black curtain back yet  sam well that was the wailing one the guy said it was the wailing one  
none	 laura we should see what it is though  liam we have heard everything that happened outside of this bubble if it is wailing at us i  dont know what that would entail for us  taliesin that says that the door is trapped not necessarily that the door is unopenable  liam yeah thats correct nott you could at least give it a whirl  sam give what a whirl  liam picking that lock we are in here for another seven hours and 40 minutes  sam oh i thought you picked that lock the red one 
none	  matt it triggered something but you feel confident  deborah ill send the hand back out to try the handle again  matt click door creaking it opens up  liam youve got to follow through  deborah sorry guys im a little absentminded  taliesin i mean theres a lot going on right now  sam we have a way out  laura should we just go out then  taliesin im going to doublecheck these bodies for things before we go if anyone wants to help  me with an investigation check  sam ill help you 
tavern	  deborah you want me to look ill go look  matt go for it  deborah youre going to help me  taliesin sure  sam great im getting day drunk  deborah 27  matt whew you give a thorough pass they are picked clean in fact you find the belt on one of  them seems to have been broken forcefully and a couple of pieces of leather that are pinched where  a belt pouch may have been resting for a while missing somebody has completely rolled these  corpses and picked them clean already  
none	 deborah sorry buddy  taliesin seems that they were robbed before they came in here its weird  deborah or while they were in here  taliesin oh thats even crazier  deborah is there a way to tell if they were robbed postmortem or premortem i dont know  how do you tell that  matt make a medicine check  marisha this is some bones shit  deborah 14  matt i mean you glance around the areas theres not much to really pull from that type of  material you dont see any heavy bruising like they 
none	 were forcefully pulled from them while they  were living necessarily its hard to tell  sam before we do anything im going to whisper to jester you know i like twiggy but she picks  all the locks she does the mage hand thing she does the hideous laughter thing she paints  laura she makes a duplicate of herself  sam she has a cute animal  laura and she likes chocolate  sam are we being replaced is this some joke  laura i mean i dont know  sam maybe they dont need us any more 
none	  laura maybe they brought her on purpose and they dont want us anymore  sam oh my god  laura its possible  sam lets kill her  laura well  sam when the moment is right  laura okay okay  laughter  matt so what are you guys doing  liam i am placing frumpkin outside of the bubble  laura he always sends frumpkin in to die  liam i am going to go look in the next room  deborah but i love that cat  matt okay roll a perception check for frumpkin  
dung	 liam 13  matt okay frumpkin goes up to the doorway and looks it is a dark hallway no light frumpkin  sees a little bit of light but its above like there seems to be an incline its above and to  the right its not a straight narrow hall it seems a little oddly angled  liam you know i could throw some light out there but i dont really want to announce our  presence what do you think we should do  laura does frumpkin hear anyone  liam he would have told me if he 
none	 heard i cant hear you  taliesin i mean we did just cause a giant lightning thing i feel like our presence has been announced  travis yeah were fine  taliesin im going to light up my staff at any rate  liam i come out of it  matt the light source on the staff now emanates and the chamber is lit well  liam i dont want to really announce our presence if theres somebody out there i dont know  matt this is open on this side  oohing  deborah fancy  matt i got 
none	 to use that piece finally  travis well were not going anywhere in here who wants to come with  laura all of us  taliesin although we should probably have someone check ahead just for traps  deborah ooh im sneaky sneaky unless you want to do it  sam no you just go no its fine you do it nope youve got it im fine  have fun tell me how it goes  travis jester nott yall okay  sam and laura were fine  sam were fine fjord everythings fine  laura dont worry about us 
none	  travis they just turn on you that fast  marisha i dont i think well talk later  travis okay  liam caleb says nothing  taliesin nope  deborah in fact twiggys not even really going to wait she starts to chase the cat she wants to  go see the cat and pet the cat  matt okay so twiggy leaves the radius and starts heading towards the far end of the room  deborah im going to sneakily do it though  matt all right roll a stealth check  deborah 17  matt good to 
none	 know what are the rest of you doing you watch as twiggy just leaves and starts  heading towards the door  sam oh now we have to go we cant let her die  laura we should follow her  travis yeah ill follow twiggy  liam im going to watch everyone safely go to the door and not get killed and then drop the bubble  laura i walk behind fjord and i cast blessing of the trickster when i touch your back  travis thanks jester  liam it would stay there yeah  taliesin yeah but 
none	 well know its there just in case  matt all right as everyone finds their way to the door safely you feel the moment to leave the field  liam oh yeah if i leave its gone  taliesin oh well then never mind  matt so the hut vanishes spells expended  liam hightail it out of this fucking room  travis that was well used my man  matt you guys exit and make your way into the hallway the hallway itself drops temperature  dramatically its similar to the space that you guys were in last time 
none	 you feel for the edges and  theres no real shape or texture to it its just solid it feels almost like stone but not quite  its hard to place as youre stepping into the chamber i would say nott and fjord you both get  just a hint of vertigo you glance and you take a step into the hallway and its an incline you  look up and you can see the light its hard to make out but you see a faint bit of light at the  end of it maybe a hundred or so 
none	 feet ahead of you  sam vertigo just from the shape of the room  matt just like stepping into the room and having no real idea of where the walls and ceiling and  floor are it just looks like a black shape and youre feeling some walls but theyre a little  rounded its a strange aspect to this hallway  laura does the floor seem rounded too  matt no the floor just seems like a steady incline  deborah we dont see light or anything at the end of it  matt you see the end 
none	 of the tunnel but you cant make out whats on the other side its too far  sam can you make light is anyone we need light  taliesin i was making light  liam with your staff yeah  matt as caduceus steps in with the staff the light seems to be crushed down to where you can  see the faint bit of it there but theres something about this hallway thats swallowing the  light or at least compressing it to where its not giving off much of a radius while you are standing in it  
none	 sam thats weird do we press ahead  taliesin i mean  deborah no other way to go  taliesin can you see anything beau  marisha thats what i was going to ask its a forceful darkness and looking at fjord get  nauseous does this remind me of any ghostly presence that i experienced before  matt not necessarily but make a perception check for me  liam do i recognize it as an obvious arcane effect  matt make an arcana check  marisha oh my god  liam natural 20  marisha 11  matt you 
none	 cant make out much detail beyond the end of the hallway you however theres  something about this that feels extraplanar meaning the end of this doorway whatevers at the  other end is being tethered by something thats not really material space you dont know what  distance youre traveling between these two objects  liam okay i relay this to the group we jumped dimensions to get here and whatever is laying  before is not a hallway in a way it is but not the traditional sense  sam but it might even be the way back 
none	 out  liam it might be yeah  travis as we turn around and look at the door that we came back through are there any markings  above the door or around it  matt perception check  taliesin im going to roll eyes of the grave too just to see if anything  travis 20 no 19  matt no in fact its weird because the doorway itself is this well carved inlaid beautiful door  as soon as you step into the hallway and look at the opposite end the hallway is just flush with  the 
none	 exterior of it and seems to curve out into the rest of the hallway it seems intentionally placed  to match perfectly but has a natural feel to its shape its weird  liam you said we can see the end of this passageway but not whats beyond it  matt correct  taliesin im rolling eyes of the grave just for the hell of it  matt right nothing comes up  sam well twiggy  deborah im happy to keep going  sam all right  matt marching order please  deborah ill be in first  travis 
none	 twiggy 50 feet behind everyone else  matt whos after twiggy  deborah im skipping  sam ill go after twiggy  matt nott and twiggy whos after nott  laura ill go after nott  travis ill go after jester  marisha ill be after fjord  taliesin ill be after beau  matt caleb in the back  sam always hey were sort of in size order  laura hey caleb you know in haunted houses a lot of time they attack the person in the back  taliesin im paying attention  deborah im skipping stealthily  
none	 taliesin singing tiptoe through the tulips  deborah like bugs bunny  laura no thats a really creepy song from thats from insidious  matt you continue along this hallway walking it takes you a moment to realize but as youre  moving forward the light seems to turn like whatever this source is the light shifts  slightly like whatever source is there seems to have some sort of movement as youre paying  attention and the closer you get to it you begin to see its like a flickering of firelight theres a  flamebased light source within 
none	 whatever this next area is but it seems to be rotating you begin to  make out shapes vaguely of things within that room but its rotating as you walk it takes a  moment for you all to realize that this chamber youre spiraling around it but theres no change  to your sense of gravity but it a corkscrew movement  laura whoa thats freaky  travis vomiting  laughter  matt eventually you come to the end of the hallway inside it appears to be a warm interior  its a crafted den or study of some 
none	 kind but the angle youre at as you come to the end of it is a  heavy steep angle you see all these bookshelves and a desk across the chamber and there are  candelabras in there theyre all this harsh angle but theyre not sliding theyre all held  in place by something  taliesin or we are  laura by gravity  taliesin im going to try and use thaumaturgy through the door to see if i can affect the flame  before we enter  matt okay you cast thaumaturgy no effect  taliesin well thats 
none	 weird  deborah its in front  taliesin were not in there yet  deborah the flames we see are between us  matt the flames you see are inside the chamber and you havent entered the chamber yet the  thaumaturgy doesnt seem to  deborah but are they in the way of us entering the chamber  matt no  deborah oh okay  taliesin no i was just curious if the magic would follow through apparently not or whatever  is in there is not real i dont know  laura can we see any movement outside 
none	 the flames  matt make a perception check  sam come on jessie  laura oh well 11 no  matt no movement beyond just the slow movement of flames  marisha is there any scripture or writing on the  matt in the interior of the hallway  marisha yeah to like enter this door  matt make a perception check  marisha natural 20  matt looking around the edge of the hall the ending you dont see any script or symbols  looking inside the chamber though as you get close and peer within this is definitely 
none	 a study  of some kind there are bookshelves upon bookshelves that round different areas you can  see a desk on the far end with a chair there you dont see anybody in it across from where this  desk is you get close and push and past twiggy and nott to look inside this is a tall chamber  its maybe 70 or 60 foot tall taller almost than it is wide on the opposite end of the desk above  this large collection of bookshelves there is a heavy stained glass window thats about 30 or 40 
none	  feet tall and about 40 to 50 feet wide  marisha is there any image in the stained glass  matt there is no light source behind it you can see the stained glass and that there are colors to  it but theres nothing behind no daylight to really make it clear from this distance youd  have to get closer  deborah do we see any other exits in this tower this chamber  matt not from where youre standing but you guys still have not entered the chamber  laura should we do it stealthily  
none	 sam yes  marisha i think were about to enter into someones study  laura im going to case pass without a trace on all of us  matt so everyone gets plus ten to their stealth check id like everyone to roll a stealth check  for me please  travis 21  matt beau  marisha 34  liam 15  sam 32  laura 17  deborah 20  taliesin 24  matt overall pretty good stealth scores you feel pretty confident that as you one by one enter  the chamber bracing yourself to slide down 
none	 with the curved floor and you stumble and trip as you  enter because as soon as you step in your whole perspective shifts and gravity is as it should be  in that chamber you all step in at an odd angle and have to catch yourself as you have to reorient  yourself in an instant  liam like stepping off a moving sidewalk at the airport but way worse  matt yes  laura that was a neat trick  matt as you all step in the chamber let me get a visual reference  cheering  
none	 taliesin so many toys today  sam the raven and the rook is a thing that i dont have any information about  laura they make badass notebooks  liam ring based  taliesin hey oh  oohing  sam look at all those books  laura whoa theres a ladder you guys  deborah we like ladders  taliesin i love a good ladder  matt pushing into this chamber this door is already open  laura ooh a door that works  matt you guys all step into the interior of this den of some kind  travis 
none	 im not looking at your notes im just looking through the wall  matt its fine  laura wheres the fireplace is it straight across  matt theres no fireplace but there are candelabras throughout the chamber that give a  light source that flickers throughout the interior this is all bookcases these are  bookcases these are bookcases these are bookcases this is a closed bookcase theres a  small desk here and a large desk here and the stained glass window stands up there  laura those books look like you could remove them and play with them 
none	  travis caleb passes out  liam nosebleed  taliesin im going to try the candelabra again see if i can get those flames a little brighter  matt once you start all of the flames flicker brighter causing deeper shadows across the chamber  taliesin ill reel them back in all right thats good to know  deborah you say now we see a door and its open  matt thats the door you came through  sam but theres no other doors in this room  matt make a perception check you guys entered from that side  
none	 sam i will look for a door thats cocked six  laura that wasnt cocked  matt it looks pretty solid  travis you say the stained glass window was on which wall  matt this wall here  travis gotcha thank you  matt theres a ladder over there as well looks like these are all set aside for climbing and  getting higher  travis ill climb up the ladder and get just under the stained glass window  matt okay  travis can i see through the glass or at the glass or is it above me 
none	  matt no you can see through it it starts maybe six inches off where that platform starts and then  continues up for the next 40 or so feet looking through it is darkness void a lack of light  the only color youre able to make out is what the candlelight from the inside of the chamber is  enabling you to see from the inside from this side  taliesin im going to maybe throw some illumination up so we can see the window a bit better  matt okay as you all step into the middle 
none	 of the chamber to look at this stained glass window above you  laura we should have checked for traps and stuff you guys  taliesin yeah i was going to say i was actually thinking about getting up i would like that that  weird corner ladder  matt over here  taliesin yeah  matt sure you place yourselves where you want to be  travis you and your damn loft positions taliesin  taliesin i like a good loft position since i was a kid my favorite thing  matt as theres more light in the chamber 
dung	 you can see now above this desk there is a  12foottall sixfootwide picture frame in the picture frame from the side angle it has no  image as you step into the center an image comes into shape you see a tall ten to 12foottall  portrait of a man thin of light brown skin long dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a very  thinlygroomed chin beard that falls to a point three or four inches below its a very succinct  point wearing a red robe with gold trim  laura does he have a ring 
none	 on  matt he is wearing a handful of rings on his hands billowing sleeves folded across his lap  his eyes are a piercing amberyellow color and his lip curls ever so slightly into a knowing smile  deborah he doesnt look like sir cadigan does he  matt no  laura okay thats where i was going what about a green ring though does he have a green ring  taliesin can we see his feet  matt no its lap up  laura wait describe him say him again  sam do all of it again  
dung	 matt a tall thin man of light brown skin with long dark hair that tumbles past his shoulders a  very thinlygroomed chin beard that falls to a point about three inches below his chin wearing a  red robe with gold trim with billowing sleeves that fold across his lap his eyes are a piercing  amber yellow his lips curl ever so slightly into a knowing smile there you go  laura and hes got lots of rings on  matt yeah hes got some intricate rings on his fingers  sam hes wearing a red robe you 
none	 said  matt yes it looks almost the same coloration the same deep red the same gold trim  laura oh look i bet its that guy thats his robe  travis whats that  laura hes thin  travis ah ah  deborah guys i really want to know whats in the closed cabinet can i go look  taliesin i would check for things but  deborah should i use my fancy hand again  liam i think both of you should be taking a look around in this moment  matt while thats happening the stained glass 
dung	 window now that you have light thats  illuminating it  marisha oh shit  matt there is no backlight so its just the light that you have on it right there it shows  clusters of different colored circles and discs arranged in a strange tethered pattern you see  different colored discs different sizes and colorations that are laid into this with  fragments of dark blues and grays in between they are all tethered by these silver threads and  various tangled it looks like a crazed synesthesia equation if you will anybody whos  trained in 
none	 arcana or history go ahead and roll  travis okay then  liam the worst roll  marisha dont fuck me gil  travis 15  marisha 15  matt okay this arrangement you begin to make out is a layout of the planes the transitive  planes of the ethereal and the astral between the realms you see these clouds of gray and light  blue that mingle and create a venn diagram where everything overlaps on top of they act as the  threads that hold these things together and connect them in between the inner planes showing 
none	  the elemental chaos where the primordial elements were ordered into following the founding of  exandria you can see where the flaming sphere is placed here and there is the water and the wind  and the earth that is the scattering of these inner planes  deborah is there a you are here sticker  travis yeah  marisha thats actually yes  matt the outer planes where the realms where the divine exist are scattered and connected all  surrounding the material plane on the outer side what you both notice two things are off about  
none	 this one theres no divine gate shown here in this whole layout there is no reference most  maps or sketches or historical designs of this type of a layout contains the divine gate because  that was a major event that happened after the calamity and separated all of the gods from the  mortal planes  liam and laura this is old  liam old just like the device  matt you get the sense this was designed before the divine gate was ever created number two  there is an additional shape smaller than the rest a 
none	 tiny rubylike circle that floats in the  astral sea that is not tethered to anything and seems to not really fit within your understanding  of the cosmos  travis a small ruby circle  matt like the same color like the color of a ruby  sam a ruby in the astral sea  matt and laura aww  travis does it blink shine shimmer move  matt no its just the same type of material as everything else its the glass the windows made  out of  marisha and where is that amongst the planes the 
none	 little ruby amongst the sea is it in between two  certain certain planes  matt it looks like its sitting in the center of the astral sea and doesnt have any tethers  everything else seems to be tethered by these silver cords almost that puts in this large  tapestry and that is just floating between all the lines in the middle of the astral sea  travis confused by its location im gonna touch it  matt you touch it  travis yep  deborah yes  marisha oh shit  matt you touch it and all 
none	 of you hear this loud heavy shattering sound as the window shatters into  a hundred different pieces all of them stopping about three feet from the window and freezing in  place fjord standing before it in this void gets sucked into the darkness and the glass window  closes behind him  marisha what  sam ah what did he touch  marisha are you serious  deborah he touched the  matt no no one technically was watching  liam the red bubble this is some labyrinth shit motherfucker  laura what just happened where did fjord 
none	 just go  sam yelling fjord no  marisha why does this keep happening to you  travis because i do stupid shit  matt so what are you guys doing well get to you later  deborah we were on the way to the cabinet  travis why does he got to describe it and make it sound so interesting  sam how can you focus on the cabinet right now  deborah because maybe itll tell us where he went  sam okay youre right there might be information in there lets go look at the cabinet  
none	 deborah were going to the cabinet  sam i will support you and help you and aid you but judgmentally  laura im going to run up where fjord disappeared  marisha i was actually technically watching from downstairs  matt you guys notice him vanish theres no like where did fjord go you heard the wall explode and  him disappear and then it reset itself and closed  sam no one else touch it  taliesin okay lets all just be very careful before we do anything  deborah i like his style  liam i know a 
none	 lot of people are doing a lot of things but eventually get to me im going to  start ransacking the desk for notes about that  matt okay calebs heading over to the desk as youre walking by caleb there are books and  books on these shelves and you notice that all of the books have a brass binding around them like a  lock like a square shaped manacle that is affixed around it and it looks like all of them are  locked in some way there might be ways to open it but it looks

none	  slam down onto a circular stone dais its rising out of the middle of this chamber about two feet  up you slam into it get up theres a smattering of bone fragments across this platform and the  floor around it bone fragments bones you look around you and youre standing in the center of an  arrowshaped chamber it pulls back a little bit behind you but to the backright of you there is  a long hallway that goes into darkness that way to the backleft of you theres another hallway  that goes into darkness 
none	 behind you in front of you the chamber continues on for about another 40  or so feet theres a dead end it curves to a dead end and there is a pedestal in shadow with an  orb there set onto this pedestal before it sits more corpse fragments surrounding glittering coins  and jewels lots of jewels and gems what little bit of low light in here is catching them what  little bit of light there is its just the dull blue light you can look up and the portal that  you fell through is this 
none	 faint blue sparkling loop that is the only light source in here the rest of  its through your darkvision you can just see the faint flicker of it reflect and refract through  these scattered gemstones amongst this pile and a curled mass of deep cerulean blue scales you hear  a heavy snort from under a large rigid horn as a pair of pale blue eyes open and focus onto you  the body of the large creature remaining at rest while its folded wings twitch powerful but  surprisingly slender this young blue dragon lifts its head
