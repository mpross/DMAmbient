none	 intense music  applause  matt good morning everyone whoa there we go i think were good  mary good morning  matt morning  mary how do you want to do this  matt i saw you were repping with this shirt it made me happy yeah both of our schedules on our  badges said this was the main stage so if you have any friends that are there let them know  that theyre in the wrong place and that its okay because we were also at the wrong place we  almost fought for it too 
none	 there were guild wars folks there and we were like whose panel is this  are you sure  mary smackdown backstage  matt it almost happened so welcome to our saturday morningish near noonish critical role panel  applause  matt glad you guys could join us who here hasnt seen the show  mary awesome oh great  matt fantastic so careful with spoilers  alarm beeping  matt explosion sorry i just assume thats what follows that sound were a show of a bunch of  voice actors that sit around roll dice and play dungeons  
none	 dragons like the longterm basement  nerds we are its awesome thats pretty much the show once a week on twitch well get together and  continue to game and people show up and watch us and its really amazing i dont really know how  it happened but you guys are incredible and the community thats come out of this is continuously  blowing me away so a round of applause for you guys  applause  mary i dont know who did it  matt weve got mood lighting now heck yeah and the ominous countdown in the 
none	 corner  mary i know we have to solve this puzzle  matt so if we have that going like the 24 sound through the whole panel itd be great  mary thatd be terrifying  matt we should start with intros mary  mary hi im mary elizabeth mcglynn and i had never played dungeons  dragons until matt asked  me onto critical role and i played a tiefling warlock named zahra i have two kill shots one on  rimefang poor sucker and a beholder much to vexs i vexed vex with two kill shots laura  
none	 bailey is very mad at me its her birthday today so get on board and actually its liam and  lauras birthday today so tweet them the twins birthday  matt thats actually how they came up with the idea to make their characters twins is because  they share a birthday and i said well thats convenient  mary so id never played dungeons  dragons i had no idea ive taken a lot of theater and i  didnt realize i think i was intimidated by it because the kids i knew growing up were really  they 
none	 kept to themselves and were this really quiet shy group and i was a bit louder and with a  louder group of nerds and they were a quieter group of nerds so we never really crossed borders  and theyd play dd all the time i dont know what that is and its freaking me out a little bit  until i realized its just improv with dice rolling to see how well your improv goes and i  thought thats brilliant these were the probably the most creative people i couldve known and i  didnt get a 
none	 chance to know them and now i do i just love the idea that it is one of the most  creative things you can do and whats come out of it the fan art the fan shipping all the stuff  thats happening and kash and zee are not an item lets put it out there now  matt we have built tumblr trash yes  mary yes first of all to watch this guy in action is just amazing unbelievable amazing  ive been directing matt for years and i had no idea i was like im so 
none	 intimidated to direct you  now laughs  matt it is a weird reversal for most of my life its been oh dont let them know you play  dungeons  dragons  mary how long have you been playing  matt ive been playing since my freshman of high school so 20 years this year  mary wow  matt ive been playing longer than some of you have been alive oh god  mary what was the first character you rolled  matt that hit me harder than i expected  mary its true though terrifying  matt 
none	 first character i ever made i was invited to the game and i didnt know much about the  logistics of it but i wanted to be a wizard because magic practitioners sound like a really  cool idea and so i made a wizard this was second edition dd so i had to learn how thac0 worked  and i was like okay what kind of wizard can i make oh there are kits and your kits are ways  you customize your character and so i was like oh a militant wizard i get to wield a sword 
none	 and  be a wizard like gandalf cool little did i know it was the most useless kit ever because wizards  back then were so dead if you didnt have magic ready so if you get up with a sword and go eh  youre dead so it wasnt the best idea but it was fine and we played for a bit but my dm at the  time was not the best dm and after we played for a few months i got really frustrated with the  style and we had one crux moment during a game 
none	 that got me so frustrated i just left and decided  im going to dm my own stuff now i know theres more to this it can be better and i really  havent played characters much since  mary youve been dming that long  matt yeah ive played in games ive played a lot of other systems as well but dds kinda  where my heart is because im a big rpg fantasy nerd  mary how are you liking fifth edition  matt i love it i love it i think ive really enjoyed second edition because 
none	 it was all i knew  although it had its quirks somehow everyone had 18100 strength everyone was really lucky when  they rolled their character but the math was ridiculous but it had such depth to it and 30  and 35 i felt were really really good ways to allow character customization it did tend to complicate  aspects of combat or at least cause a lot of floating modifiers and the math kind ofwhile  less esoteric math based around the ac and thac0 equation it didnt lend to a lot of everyone  paying attention to 
none	 okay you get the 1 from here and this gives you 1 to hit and damage from  the bard thing oh but you have this bless spell on so its another 1 to hit from there so 4  but youre also turned away so its 3 and ugh i just start bleeding from the nose  mary head explodes  matt but you know you made it work and it was better than previous editions and fourth edition  came out and that was a struggle to certain points i ran a longterm fourth edition game  which 
none	 my friend shawn actually played in here yeah we actually had a great job actually shawn  here if you guys are watching the game we did the other night we had the qa he was the rogue in  my ravenloft campaign for two years that ended up taking over the castle after strahd and cut out  the bards tongue and turned him into his own private theon at end of the game a real happy  ending there ravenloft  mary sang with a lot of vowels after that  matt fourth edition it had some cool 
none	 ideas i love the skill challenge aspect of it i felt the  idea of the atwill magics magic practitioners never actually ran out of spells there was some  lowlevel stuff that they could just do forever it was really great and useful because as a  wizard i never wanna have to go well im out of spells you shouldnt have that you shouldnt  have to be able to only mage hand three times a day im like no i dont want to pick up stuff  i trained for years in this shit make my book 
none	 float to me so the fourth edition atwill magics  carried over as the cantrips in fifth and so they kept that over which was really nice the skill  system was a little more refined and the fifth edition combat and character development still  allows a breadth of customization with your character but not overcomplicated and i really  felt like they streamlined it in the right ways so im really enjoying fifth edition i think its  audio skips  mary yeah cantrips are awesome because i realized as a warlock i get three spells and  
none	 thats it i mean like three thats it  matt to be fair those three spells  mary theyre pretty good  matt they pack a punch there  mary come on how many hit points did rimefang have left when i did the hellish rebuke it was  like six right so laura could have went blows on him and he would have been dead it was just i  got lucky with the timing of my turn thats it both times happy birthday laura laughs  matt thats one of the things i love about this game in 
none	 general and any rpg system is everybody  who grew up as a kid playing in their front yard kind of fighting windmills like don quixote we  all had that period of time where we embraced our imagination and made up stories and went with it  and as we grow up society tends to have this trend of pushing that thought away no you must  be a realist you must not play you must not be able to get together with people and just be  creative for the hell of being creative and rpgs are one 
none	 of the mediums that continues to allow  that to flourish long into adulthood and i think its such a wonderful therapeutic and positive way  of reinforcing social connection with people ive built stronger bonds with the people ive gamed with  than most anybody else in my life and theres something about that shared adventure experience  thats so wonderful and those memories are real  mary but youre worldbuilding too in your memory building off of these characters i look  up i mean these are some of my best friends in the world are playing on 
none	 critical role and after  a while i forget that its laura and travis and sam and liam im just worried about how the hell  is scanlan going get out of this stupid dragon and grog is on the chain flying behind him and vex  cant fly fast enough on the broom and if he lets go i mean these are massive concerns about  these characters that ive really come to love i let go of the fact that im stalking my friends  online because it was a real conflict for a while is it weird 
none	 that im watching my friends  every week play this game and i realize it wasnt i know its weird why be normal right  but it was amazing and im just so in love with these characters im so glad that pike is back  its just  cheers and applause  matt weve never been so torn about promoting a friends television series go watch blindspot  hopefully itll get a second season  ashley youre like some kind of wizard  audrey what do we do now elf  ashley actually i am a gnome cleric now 
none	  mary so we keep praying to move blindspot to la so she doesnt have to go back to new york  matt so if we can write a petition to blindspot to set the show in la next season thatd be  great wed appreciate that part of this since you know the gist of it so far lets open the  floor to questions well turn this into a qa we have a microphone  mary theres a mic there so if you guys want to ask anything  matt go ahead and line up behind that microphone 
none	 and well start taking your questions one at time  well get through as many of you guys as we possibly can as you can see we have a looming  48 47 minutes left  mary 4747 make a wish  matt all right sir whats your name  conner my names conner hello hello screw it im loud  mary be loud conner be loud  conner my names conner sometimes people call me tiffany dont ask why  matt hi connertiffany  conner so my question a bit more of a serious one theres so much stigma 
none	 around games like dd  and roleplaying and stuff like that that society sometimes tends to exploit that nerd  culture with shows like big bang theory and whatnot  matt shudders  conner i told you it was a serious question  matt no it is and you definitely tugged a cord there you invoked that which should not be  invoked continue no its a necessary conversation  conner now things like critical role which features if i may say a charismatic cast of  people that are authentically playing the game how do you think this is 
none	 going to trend in the  next ten years where these types of things start to become more popular culture where they start  having followings niche audiences like with twitch its a great way to get out to 20 or 30  thousand views per episode livestreaming do you think its going to keep addressed in this area do  you think you its going to become an actual television series or something like that one day  what are your thoughts on that  matt i dont know were still kind of holding on as to what this 
none	 show is we had no idea this  was going to become whatever it is we had like a six to eight week plan of well if it doesnt  work out well just go home and keep playing on our own and people found us and resonated and  started creating their own games and it just built this community that i never expected its become  so much more important to me than just a game we play now its introducing other people to it and  watching them create their own stories with their friends and send 
none	 us pictures of their game nights  and their families playing now to me its dd has an unfortunate stigma because of when the  time it came out there was a very antidd fundamentalist christian movement that didnt  understand the game just saw surface elements and decided that it was evil demons being summoned  conner those are my people i apologize  matt oh no its okay its my people too southern accent my familys all from the south as  well i fully understand dont think yall gotta carry that burden just yourself so that put 
none	 a  stigma on it and the media of course ran with it as it does so yeah it got off to a bad start  but i think now through geek culture becoming pop culture for better or for worse i think largely  for the better youre now seeing a trend of people that grew up playing dd who grew up  writing stories and making up stories with their friends are inheriting the entertainment  industry theyre becoming the producers and the writers and the directors of films television so  thats part of the reason weve 
none	 had this big surgence in geek culture is because now the people  that are creating the media are the geeks we took over  mary yeah yeah we did it wasnt the meek shall inherit the earth it was the geeks shall  inherit the earth i mean it really is  matt and so to your question there im not sure where its going to go i think its cool that  its bringing it to an audience that didnt have the opportunity to really understand at first  there are a lot of people out there that 
none	 would love to play rpgs but like mary said you just  didnt really know what it was and there was a weird between the stigma or just intimidation  you didnt think it was something you could or would want to do and so through these shows a  lot of people message us almost daily saying since i watched your show i went out and bought  the books and started a game with my family or with my father and we reconnected through it  its become this really cool reemergence of tabletop gaming and thanks to 
none	 other shows like  high rollers and the real role play guys and now the dice camera action that wizards does  theres this trend now of people showing other people what dd can be and other rpgs as well  like zac who used to run our stream is now doing his hyper rpg go up in seattle and theyre doing  a bunch of awesome shadowrun games and all these different other types of rpgs as well so will it  end up mainstream media i dont know i know theres people trying it because whenever  anything 
none	 seems to be doing well on the internet that means all the executives in a room somewhere  with a bunch of suits have to be like how can we capture this and make money so im sure well  see some attempts at that some may be genuine some may not be i think the charm of our show is  the fact that were just a bunch of doofuses that like each other a lot and play for our own  amusement not necessarily to make maximum dollar for our company as soon as that gets introduced  
none	 it kind of gets a little weird and i dont know the flavor gets a little tainted for me so i  think as long as people are genuine in producing this content it will still resonate with people  so well see how the entertainment industry treats it i know were putting our feet on the ground  making sure that it doesnt fall in that category because i would rather jump in front of traffic laughs  mary yeah i also feel like its sort of starting to change the whole idea of adulting you know  of 
none	 what it is to be an adult and you have to be straight and serious and everything else and its  just like that combined with the internet and everything in this sort of isolationism that that  causes that this is now bringing people together again in a social environment to be creative and  with the cutting of funding in schools and everything else i feel like were sort of losing  that creativity and that idea that we are here to thats one of our main things as human  beings is the power to create you 
none	 know i just think its an amazing thing and i think its  bringing people together and bringing this out of the basement and into the light and making it  cool and that its all right to now talk to people again and not just sit on your phone and  tweet anonymously to people you know  matt to be fair its okay to go back in the basement for those of us who dont like light  mary yeah thats fine  matt not a fan of sunlight myself basements cool  mary yeah nothing wrong with 
none	 that but still go out and see the stars theres no light go look  at the stars  conner thats it well thanks for coming to momocon  matt and mary thanks for having us  mary thanks tiffany we love you  stephanie i think its working do i need to be hi  matt hi whats your name  stephanie stephanie  matt hi stephanie  stephanie i just wanted to say thank you for bringing critical role into my life because its  amazing and im pretty sure into everybody elses life thats here so i 
none	 just wanted to thank  you personally and also congratulate you guys personally for 50 plus episodes of critical role  cheering  stephanie and so my question is im sorry im shaking  matt its okay  stephanie my question to you guys which is your favorite character in the critical role world  matt okay favorite character in the critical role world  mary whats his name who percy goes to to get ammunition  matt victor  mary victor victor the fact that who watched the birth of victor the first time i mean come  on 
none	 how where it just came out  matt thats what scares me i dont know where it came from that was a purely improvised character  that has become like a staple now  mary i know and im so afraid every time you go back to him theres going to be less and less of him  laughter  matt theres a good chance when youre the only individual that has discovered black powder in the  universe and thats kind of your personality youre not going to be very careful with it weve  already seen him blow 
none	 up once though it was not in canon victors an interesting one im sure  hell show up again  mary theyre all so unique though everybodys got such wonderful personalities i love the way  that vax and vex play off of im a twin so to see them play off each other yeah theyre  totally twins its kind of amazing and sam riegel is just a bloody genius  laughter  mary i dont know where that stuff comes from  matt same place victor came from i think  mary yeah i think so and travis 
none	 who doesnt love grog i was sort of scared with craven edge  i thought for a while bacon might take our grog and i dont want that to happen  matt yeah chuckles  laughter  mary and theres still the skull still that skull though isnt that skull still there  matt yeah what happened to that skull  mary i dont know where did that skull go  matt i know where it went  laughter  mary how far in advance do you plan where theyre going to go in this world i mean  matt 
none	 i dont plan where theyre going to go because i dont know where theyre going to go i  plan possible places they can go i try and prepare enough to the point where im not  completely lost if they make random choices but it still happens occasionally for me its about  considering what their discussions have been in the game listening to what their characters have  insinuated they might want to do next and then ill flesh out those avenues they might possibly  go so that when they choose that path or this path i 
none	 have some things prepared for it  mary did you have the acid river prepared when you knew at some point they were going to get on  that rug  laughter  mary im sorry i know its a very painful wound  matt no the acid river had nothing to do with the rug the acid river had everything to do with wil  wheaton being a guest in that episode  laughter  mary okay why  matt okay so you arent aware of this wil wheaton used to play on acquisitions inc which is  the 
none	 pax prime live game they did with the official dd folks and he had a character named aeofel who  died horribly in a pit of acid  mary oh did he always roll ones  matt of course its wil wheaton  laughter  matt and it became a thing he was really distraught that his character died straightup and  was gone for good in this acid pit and the internet of course let him know hey man your  guy died in acid hes like i know you get this whole long post about the eulogy of 
none	 aeofel  and it became a thing and so acid pits and him is a very sore spot so of course when i had the  opportunity to have wil wheaton play in my dd game i couldnt not do that  laughter  matt it also just unfortunately happened that the rug got in i was like oh magical enchantments can  resist certain things but thats not one of them for a tapestry  laughter  matt yeah its hard for me to pick a favorite character i really enjoy playing as an npc  gilmore is a 
none	 lot of fun  mary gilmore i was just going to say  cheering  matt the npcs i have that are the most layered are gilmore and allura and i enjoy playing them  both for different reasons because theyre both very very layered characters you guys have  probably only seen elements of those two and i hope more of that plays out in the future but  both those characters are two that i really enjoy jumping into their shoes for a bit theyre both  very close and personal to me  stephanie thank you guys 
none	  matt thank you good question  erin hello  matt hello whats your name  erin my name is erin im songtree on twitch and also twitter my question is do you guys ever  watch past episodes and if so which one have you watched the most or have you most enjoyed  mary i have watched them all i watch it every week with you guys we flew in on thursday night  landed about 1030 or 1100 and im in the car going i can find it i can find it on twitch  its there 
none	 it is and the qa was going on and stayed up until two and watched percy and then i  was like i cant watch i have to go to bed so im livetweeting with you guys pretty much every  week if im available i loved the wil and kash episodes i thought those were really fun  matt yeah  mary i wish we had been there to see pike die and be brought back  matt yeah that was intense  silence  laughter  mary i remember hearing about it laura was like aww thats the 
none	 week i was like whats wrong  shes like intense dd because you guys used to play how many hours a day you would do these  marathon sessions  matt yeah because we could only play once every four to six weeks and so wed play for a standard  eight hours or more sometimes depending  erin yeah full saturday  matt we wanted to get as much time as we could when we got the dads away from their kids we had  a very short window where were like all right maximize time then we all 
none	 go home drained worth  it so as far as your question is concerned ive rewatched a lot of them partially because i have  to go back and it works as a good notetaker as a dm to have the actual episode online id be  like what who did they meet again what npc did they talk to oh crap ill look it up okay  there we go what did that character sound like its been a helpful tool for me to have that  video there have been times where wed put episodes on in the 
none	 background when we had to leave  our bird alone for a while just so shed hear our voices  awwing  mary which is your birds favorite episode  matt i dont know shes a bird we found ourselves putting this couple of episodes on and  then sitting down and ended up watching a full episode and me and marisha would be like oh  were those people  laughter  matt were like we watched a full episode of our own show that we already did ugh it was a  good episode though  laughter  
none	 matt the one i probably watched the most just because i love the reactions to it would have  been the conclave attack  mary that was so good  matt yeah it was  mary man  matt holding on to that for two years  mary wow and stuff is going to go down i cant wait to see it  erin for me its probably cows  mary cows that was amazing  matt let me tell you seeming messes up everything in the best way thank you so much  all right we have a few 
none	 people back there well try and make these answers more concise my fault  sorry hello  andrew hi my name is andrew  mary you can tilt that up if you want no just the mic itself there you go  andrew appreciate it im tall  matt and mary hi paul  andrew no im andrew  laughter  andrew no i had to adjust the mic  mary oh youre tall hi tall  matt i see  laughter  mary sorry  andrew my question is mostly directed at matt because im kind of an aspiring 
none	 voice actor but  im kind of coming up here asking as a goingtobeadm and game designer  matt oh very cool  andrew and so i was hoping one thing im trying to figure out is ive got a game in the works  here but the thing im trying to figure out is how do i help it to where i can help players  begin to where they can just set up a character in maybe ten 15 minutes and go have there been  systems that have been fairly welcoming  matt there are many systems 
dung	 that are a lot faster at character building than dd dd is a fairly  deep system its not super deep its not rifts deep there are other systems that are a lot  faster some savage world stuff can be pretty fast to put together if you look online for fast  character generation rpgs especially on rpgnet theyll have a lot of examples that i cant think  of any off of the top of my head right now  audience dungeon world  matt dungeon world there you go thats one those are all great systems if 
none	 its dd in  particular you can also precreate characters like generate a character per class if its their  first game and they dont know what to do then instead of having them build it you can have them  pick from the list and tweak and customize a few things if they want to and then introduce them to  the game that way you have taken the weight off their shoulders ive done that for a few people  where ill create their character for them in advance and theyll show up and be like okay  
none	 ill pick this guy and im like cool go and the other characters just go away or i make them  npcs why not thats my recommendation  andrew cool appreciate it  matt no worries good question  andrew thank you  mary good luck with the voice acting  matt and good luck with he dming dude  harley okay im much shorter hi  matt and mary hi  harley my name is harley like the motorcycle because people end up calling me hayleigh  matt hey harley harley quinn is more what i would think  
none	 mary yeah its what i would go to  harley more people that i know apparently know the motorcycle than that quinn so my question is  how do yall come up with the voices for yalls characters because thats always interesting  because each of them have different accents and ways of speaking  mary zahra was easy for me the minute i said zahra i was like well thats her voice right  there anybody whos got a name called zahra and she was very sort of in there i had been doing a  female crusader for 
town	 diablo 3 and for heroes of the storm and i loved johanna and she was a bit more  street but i loved that vocal placement i didnt even know what zahra was going to be until we  started the show and then thats what the voice was it just came out of that and my obsession of  the moon and the stars and everything else so i thought id start with myself because i didnt  know anything else especially about this world so when i was building her i just said well ill  have her 
none	 be obsessed with the moon and everything else because thats an obsession im very  familiar with so i started with me and my own likes and i think im trying to figure out what i want  to roll next i would love to hear you talk about the bard the conductor  matt the maestro  mary the maestro yeah sounds really cool so short answer is zahra and thus came her voice  matt i spent a lot of time alone as a kid i dont know for me especially from a dm  standpoint its considering 
none	 sometimes character regionality or some races might have kitschy  themes through them like the dwarves i tend to go scottish not all of them but just because  its classic and i will always make any excuse for myself to do a scottish brogue because its my  favorite dialect ever i love it so much its like music horrible discordant music  mary what was the game that you were talking about yesterday with taliesin taliesin directed  you in a game  matt akibas trip  mary yeah  matt yeah they had me do the foreigner 
none	 voice which is a voice setting you can set for npcs in  the game and in the japanese version the foreigner voice is american and they couldnt do  that taliesin was like whatever accent you want to do thats not american so im like scottish  voice all right this is your foreigner which is great because you could set the voices to  little moe café maids little cute anime girl and you enter and its like scottish voice hello  would you like a tea  laughter  mary i love that story so much  
none	 matt as such i think everyone should play that game for that reason alone for me its just  what works for the character what sounds different and unique so they stand out against  each other ive made a lot of characters in this world and i dont have that many voices so its  hard to differentiate a lot of the time so i try and find ways whether it be through texture  timbre vocal patterns  mary attitude is huge  matt accents attitude physicality  mary i mean gilmore the minute you do that thats 
none	 gilmore right he doesnt need to say a  word its just all of a sudden hes there its amazing its physicality as well i think  that also for me as a watcher it really enhances the characters  matt being a dragon can be a dragon  cheering  matt but being a dragon can be a dragon  mary not anymore rimefang  matt aww  laughter  harley thank you  matt good question thank you hello there we go  nick hi  matt hi whats your name  nick im nick  matt and 
town	 mary hi nick  nick quick question you guys go to a ton of different places in westruun was the main  continent right  matt taldoreis the main continent that theyre in right now yeah  nick taldorei got it wheres westruun sorry  matt westruun is a town in central taldorei  nick got it so in taldorei you guys go to tons of different places my question is do you have  any deserts in there everywhere gets colder and colder its cold one way and then you go north  and its colder now are there 
none	 any deserts or hot places  matt on taldorei taldorei is a northern continent it starts to crest othanzia is much  colder which is the other continent that has vasselheim thats where the slayers take is  thats where the fire ashari exist that ones even further north and that ones most of the time  covered in snow or at least some level of cold cloudy weather the northern parts of taldorei  like whitestone and where kraghammer is those are a little more snowcovered but yeah its a  colder continent by nature its more of the 
none	 europeantype climate marquet is a southern  continent thats where ankharel is and that is a mostly desert continent it is probably 70  desertcovered if ever they go there that will be a very different scenic and cultural experience  than what theyve encountered at all in the campaign thus far should be interesting  nick thank you  matt no worries  nick could we hear mccree or the black powder merchant laughter either one  matt ill do you one better mccree voice its high noon  cheering  matt victor voice what time what time is 
dung	 it i dont know noon no its three oclock  there you go  nick thank you  cheering  mary so good so good  ryan hello my name is rock mckickass  mary hey kick ass  ryan my friends call me ryan first thing i wanted to do was thank you on behalf of a friend  of mine hes running a pathfinder campaign and when you did those tips and tricks videos on geek  and sundry i showed them to him and they helped him immensely at running the campaign a lot  smoother  
dung	 matt awesome thats great also a plug for a friend finding time to do more tips and tricks has  been difficult i am trying to get into a new batch soon but at the same time a good friend of  mine matt colville who is the writer of turtle rock has gone further than i ever could as far as  outlining really detailed videos on worldbuilding and running a game and running encounters so if  youre like oh im mad theres not more gm tips theres a guy who is doing a much better job than 
none	  me who is doing a lot more than me go watch his shit his stuff sorry family panel but yeah  matt colville go check out his videos they are really good anyway back to your question  ryan my question is what was the most difficult thing you have had to do as a dm and how did you  end up dealing with it if you did  matt killing a player is always a difficult thing i have done it in a few games and its not  a fun experience but it is an interesting 
none	 experience from a narrative standpoint dd is a  fantasy world and there are things that can reverse death in dd sometimes it can be later  in the game a little too easy to reverse death in my opinion thats why i introduced the skill  challenge ritual for resurrection in my game take an element of the skill challenge from fourth  edition that i liked and convert that to the idea that not every soul can be recovered whether they  themselves accept their own death or whatever entity holds sway over their immortal soul  takes 
none	 them before the ritual can thats kind of the challenge in that ritual the players their  actions in that ritual essentially represent them trying to facilitate or reach out to their soul to  stay and to come back to the body but every single time ive had to kill a player its hard  because this person has put so much energy and time into this and you are essentially not  robbing them of it but circumstantially theyre losing it and you have to be the person to agree  to it and tell them theyre gone 
none	 and it sucks and its hard and people go home sometimes  crying and youre like what have i done  laughter  matt but conversely that mourning process and that acceptance one its a fresh start for them  to create something that they have always wanted to play before and the story implications of  losing a hero really really continues to guide how tight the rest of the survivors are i had a  game once again shawn was in where we had most of the party killed in a battle with a bunch of  ghouls 
none	 in this one campaign necromancy had been abolished for so long that it was just a myth no  one believed that undead really existed or if they did its more of a wives tale and its grossly  exaggerated their first time into the shadowfell they go into this tomb and they walk into a room  with a bunch of ghouls and i think it was some sort of an undead knight and theyre like oh  what the hell are these things theyre just nastylooking people all right well go and each  take one well three 
none	 people paralyzed later they just converged and shawn being the smart  person his ranger grabbed chloe the rogue who was screaming out trying to help them and  says no we have to go theres no way we can win this and dragged her out of the tomb as they  watched their three other party members be eaten alive by the ghouls  groaning  matt and it was like what are you gonna do welcome to the shadowfell  laughter  matt thats definitely the hardest thing for me to do is to notify a player that 
none	 their character  is dead good question  jeremy afternoon my name is jeremy  matt hi jeremy  jeremy i guess this is a question for both of you one as a fan and one as a person running the  game where do you hope the current critical role campaign ends and based on the suicidal  tendencies of your players and friends where do you think its actually going to end  mary theres a fine between suicidal and brave  jeremy true  mary i like to lean towards that theyre brave  matt with a 
none	 toe in suicidal i unless they make real some serious mistakes heres the thing  for a tpk to happen they have to not be able to acknowledge their mortality most tpks happen in  games because the players are assuming theyre going to win or theyre just not being careful  if we keep fighting and keep fighting oh god hes down too i know if i keep fighting im the  only left if i keep fighting were dead you know then yeah its going to happen  like shawn that could have been a total tpk if 
town	 his character wasnt like okay were not going  to win this any chance we have of recovering this party some of us have to get out of here alive  run as long as somebody does that there are opportunities to try and retrieve a few of those  people you know because of resurrection magic and such and theres always the wish spell you  can always quest down the road part of an adventure for a while could be to find a way to  find a being of enough power to be able to wish a 
none	 friend back to life thats a classic fantasy  trope and thats a really worthwhile journey thats go to the underworld to seek a friend and  bring them back thats as old as theres been written word  mary yeah thats greek mythology  matt thats old gilgamesh days in greek mythology yeah so pause i forgot the  question  laughter  mary where do you want  matt i think they have about a year of story left before they finish the biggest arc of the story  the next step beyond the chroma conclave because thats 
none	 thordak the cinder king i expect him to  be probably around level 17 or 18 when they get to that maybe earlier depending on how brash they  are how careful they are but theres other things brewing in the world of exandria  mary theres that spinning marble of death  matt i dont know what thats about  mary i dont know what thats about what is that about  matt put all the survivors on top of it what could possibly go wrong  mary what could possibly go wrong just touch it get grog go 
none	 on grab it  matt dont tell them about the marble  mary its a good marble its good you want it  amanda hi  matt just a failed ritual  amanda hi im amanda i was wondering first of all thank you for the hours and hours that you  spend doing critical role and preparing episodes for us to watch every thursday thank you so much  cheering  amanda my question is im trying to start my own campaign at my school but and its really funny  because its a liberal arts college so youd 
none	 think that there would be a lot of people into it but  they keep turning away like oh thats not cool i was wondering you would have any tips as  to how to get people into dd because im trying to i really want to do a game  matt have you ever seen that scene in a clockwork orange with the  laughter  matt thats the hard thing you cant force someone to want to play an rpg you can always  find ways to show them that its not what you think it is and 
none	 if not critical role there are  other shows out there as well that might fit them i think thats part of one of the reasons we did  this show was we felt that there wasnt enough media out there that represented friends having fun  playing a game that was entertaining to people so we hoped it would fill that gap for some we had a  lot of people that have messaged us saying well i showed the show to a few folks and they were  like oh this is it that looks like fun thats 
none	 a way you can do it you can always pass  around episodes of our show or one of these other great shows out there as an example to be like  no no no its just friends around a table goofing off and improvising  mary also ale  laughter  mary bring beer  matt aside from that its the way youve got to explain it whenever anybody says what is  dungeons  dragons like when you asked me at the beginning what is dungeons  dragons  mary what is it yeah  matt im like 
none	 uhh its communal storytelling and improv  mary yeah  matt in a fantasy setting its like lord of the rings but youre just making it up as you go  mary thats how i describe it i was like im watching my friends make up lord of the rings and  its with dice so theres math which sucks but thats good too you need math so it hits  so many different levels its kind of amazing  matt what would you as an outsider coming in originally what do you think would be the best  way 
none	 to describe it to you if thats not it  mary that was it to me its improv i mean it was improv its come and play with your friends  were going to go into rivendell were going to create you want to be a wizard you want to be  a what do you want to be you can be anything you want you get to choose who you want to be and  were going to play and create things and see what happens  amanda thank you so much  matt youre welcome if that doesnt 
none	 work send them to me  laughter  audience member hey nice to see you guys mary i saw you yesterday hope to see you tomorrow at  your autograph signings  matt come do it  audience member my question is what has been the most interesting thing that a player has done in  the game that was totally random that you never thought would happen  mary cows  laughter  matt yeah man seeming an entire party into cows to try and masquerade as and to a certain  extent interrogate cows as cows varying sized 
none	 cows seeming messes everything up im going to  keep putting this out there i love it i love it then having to chase down a roc so cast fly on  the cows so you have a party of differentsized flying cows across the moonlight its everything  you hoped amgen would have produced  laughter  matt oh my god that was weird ive had some strange things happen ive had some surprising  things happen i think really im sorry its not because youre in the room shawn i have to  keep picking on you sorry 
none	 when you cut out jacks characters tongue was one of the most  unexpected player things to ever happen in a game  shawn well to be fair it was jack  matt i know i know he had it coming  mary so this was one of your regular players and you cut out his tongue  shawn yeah you dont know me that well mary  laughing  mary no no i dont how did he adapt to this new occurrence  audience member well how well did the young greyjoy adapt  matt not very well for 
none	 him his bard character was a vistani and was this very somewhat slimy  charismatic in that icantpossiblytrustyou ringmastery kind of way eventually he just got  fed up with it and the corruption had set in so strongly he just cut his tongue out jack played  it as this now freakedout and then subservient quiet and  mary theon  matt yes he would express his stuff through character action and describing what he was doing  emotionally but couldnt actually say it so it would be like i bow my head and nod and look  directly 
none	 in his eyes and give him a look of intense hatred but then look away and walk and  im like all right  laughter  matt this got real  laughter  mary thats the other thing i love about it is that you have to say yes if you get out there and  you roll a 20 or whatever against someone else and theyre like dont do that to me its  like i rolled a 20 you have to say yes or you have to leave its great it teaches you you have  to deal 
none	 with the shit you put out in the world and everything its consequences  matt yeah in a lot of games if one player had cut out another players tongue that would have  been a really tense angry real people being angry like he cant do that thats bullcrap  you know maybe or you could take it as a really interesting character moment the way jack did  and play it into the personality and now thats a reason for the mute character to be silently  plotting against the person who did it or try to find 
none	 a way to get their tongue back and their  comeuppance against that player that in itself can be a really cool arc as well i dont promote  pvp in your games unless your players are really into the idea and respectful of continuing the  narrative because that can go really south very quickly if youre not being mature about it but  yeah thats one of the weirder ones  audience member so thank you and just saying yalls show did inspire me to go down to the  gaming room downstairs and play my first game 
none	 of dungeons and dragons ever  matt awesome  mary yay what did you roll  audience member i decided to go with a halforc barbarian named thok that i like to do the voice for  matt and mary yeah  audience member thank you guys  cheering  matt thats awesome hello  audience matt hi my names matt  matt good strong name  laughter  audience matt it is a good strong name yes weve had this conversation before in fact so  ive been playing mostly pathfinder but a couple of different rpgs for a 
none	 little while now i dont  get to play as often as id like ive been very blessed to have some very good dms  matt awesome  audience matt we just had a bit of a perfect segue about how 20s can make things happen i want  to ask theres those instances where a series of 20s and ones tend to make something go hilariously  but horribly wrong do you have any experiences like that for example we turned fallout into  risk it was a lot of ones and 20s  matt okay thats what i 
none	 like about ones and 20s while in the system technically in dd rolling a  20 on a skill check is isnt considered a critical success necessarily i consider that just lowering  the dc on the skill check because i think a 20 should be magical whenever its rolled i think  that number is so intrinsically wonderful when you see it on the table that to roll that for a skill  check and have it not really be just a high number i think that robs you of that moment so i  do give some sort 
none	 of benefit like if grog rolled a 20 on an intelligence check a few times that  doesnt mean he suddenly has an encyclopedia in his head or that he knows exactly what hes  trying to find out but ill give him a little bit of information he otherwise might not have known  whether it be just an instinct or something he remembered hes like oh yeah you can find  ways to work it into a game but there have been a number of encounters that have been steamrolled by  a series of 20s you guys 
town	 watched percys crazy 20athon butt flap orc death 2015  mary yeah  matt thats going to be a bumper sticker by the way that whole phrase  laughter  matt there have been a series of social encounters in games previously where a wellplaced  20 or series of 20s have lead into a complete social upheaval in a city like overthrowing an  individual who is in control of a market or a political movement weve had circumstances where  a natural one ended up accidentally inciting the entire town to turn on a party weve had a 
none	 series  of unintentional 20s when youre trying to hold back end up in the death of whats supposed to be  just a threatened individual its led to a lot of very sticky situations but conversely its led to  a lot of really great narrative moments nothing really stands out in my head because weve had  quite a few of them  audience member scanlan shorthalt  matt scanlan and kaylie that was one of those natural ones when scanlans history caught up to  him and she was there to kill him or at least cut 
none	 him down to the point where he would  understand the pain that she went through through his speech and she rolled a straight one those  are those perfect narrative moments they dont work out often but every now and then you get  that moment where it would be perfect if i had critically succeeded or critically failed at this  moment and then it happens thats the magic of the game for me those are the moments you  remember forever  audience matt we basically killed an essential npc  matt yeah good job guys thats 
none	 a whole questline youll never touch again thank you hello  nathan hi there im nathan  matt and mary hi nathan  nathan i have no idea who you two are ive honestly never heard critical hit before and this  seems like a series i need to invest in  mary have you ever played dd  nathan ill jump right to that about two years ago i just had a couple of friends invite me to play  dd just after so many years of avoiding it for the social stigma that you referenced decided to  
none	 finally give it a shot and the people who i was with were amazing just playing with them getting  to know them and getting to know their player it really is a whole separate meta when you play  it but our dm was horrendous comically so  mary like showgirls bad or  laughter  mary i love showgirls  nathan he had the strange tendency of wanting to constantly put us in danger but never  kill a character which was a very strange kind of presentation it really speaks to the enjoyment of  the game 
none	 and the players when we played for twice a week for six months hating the game and just  enjoying hating it after two years of playing getting new players and whatnot im finally going  to try my hand at playing i didnt have your magical quip and im just going to start my own  after two years had a lot of good experiences but what i wanted to ask you is as a starting dm  i know theres going to be so much im going to learn and clearly got tips and tricks videos im  
none	 going to take a look at but what i want to know is what major pitfall should i avoid how should  i avoid being that first dm thats absolutely terrible that showgirls dm for my very first party  matt my biggest recommendation is start small if youre doing homebrew if youre making your  own world start small if youre running a premade adventure or module it can be a little  easier especially for your first time because a lot of the information is already provided for  you but if youre creating your own story start 
town	 small you get stuck in this worldbuilding aspect  of trying to build a whole continent a whole culture multicultures and political structure  between these two sides and all of a sudden your party is like were going to spend the next six  months in this city youre like but i built all this okay so start on that city build a  small town or a small farm village or wherever you want them to start and just focus on fleshing out  that small area consider the major npcs who they interact with positively or negatively 
town	 whats the  antagonistic force in that area thats going to be driving the story what type of character intrigue  can you input in this small little cluster of people and then once they start playing it their  decisions will begin to inform your worldbuilding how they interact with these people what kind of  things that their characters are interested in finding in the story will inform you of what kind  of things you can put into the world down the road that will really hook them and get them  interested in the story as 
none	 they progress so start small have some big ideas and take notes on  things you would like to build in the long run but dont overwork yourself creating everything at  once and have only this much be seen for a year thats my biggest recommendation because all of  that effort you put into a smaller area will make that small area so much more fleshed out and  lively and real in their minds and really give you the dm the confidence of knowing that  whatever they do in this little area you have a really 
none	 strong idea of where it might go and how  you can react to their decisions thats my biggest recommendation  nathan thank you  matt no worries  mary we have about five minutes left so lets see if we can go really fast and we can get all of  you guys done  blake hey my name is blake  mary hey blake  blake the question i had is what was the saddest moment youve had dming other than pikes death  one of those moments where it happened and you had to do it but 
town	 you felt bad doing it other  than killing a player  matt other than killing a player killing my city of emon man building a town over two and a half  three years and having it be like a central location to the story and the characters world  and where they live and everyone they love lives for the most part and its the political center  and then having to because it was the narrative i built where the world was going and where the  story needed to be come in and just smash it 
none	 just kick all my legos over  mary but it was such a cool way to do it  matt oh it was fun  mary oh such a cool way  matt weirdly cathartic  blake thank you  matt youre welcome in a stomp my own sandcastle kind of way  mary yeah rawr you played godzilla in your own tokyo  matt basically hello  sean hi my name is sean  matt hey sean  sean so there has been a fad going around im not sure if youve heard of it called out of  
none	 context dd quotes  laughter  mary oh  sean so this is lines from different campaigns that when taken completely out of their original  settings sound hysterical an example of a campaign that i started thanks to you guys no  your familiar cannot hold a spear it is made of spaghetti  laughter  sean are there any lines like that or moments of the show either critical role or any  other campaign youve had that for people who may not have seen the show may really enjoy  matt sure im not going to be 
none	 able to quote things exactly from memory but something along  the lines of okay im going to focus on the poop in a jar what can i see around me thats one  laughter  matt critical role ladies and gentlemen  mary woohoo  stefan hi my name is stefan do you play final fantasy  laughter  stefan im sorry  cheering  matt yes  stefan yes i have a question about the new game thats coming out final fantasy xv would that  one have online like open roam like final fantasy xiv  matt 
none	 i dont know as far as i know from the game i dont think its multiplayer but i think  theyre making it a little more open world like you can wander around the map its not like final  fantasy x where you had an airship and you pick places and it drops you down there i think its a  little more open world wandering from what ive seen in the trailers but its not multiplayer  like xiv is if thats what your question means  stefan oh okay yeah that was my question  matt as 
none	 far as i know but when i find out ill let you know i promise  stefan all right thank you  matt thanks buddy  mary okay quick we only have a minute left  matt we can do this we can do this  audience member fist of all i just wanted to thank you guys for sharing what is normally such  an intimate experience with everyone on behalf of everyone here and thousands of people on the internet  mary thats because of you matt  audience member im actually here with my players everyone in 
tavern	 my current campaign is here today  matt awesome  audience member im starting to run another one for some people who felt left out and then my  current players wanted to play and all of a sudden ive got nine people and two beasts hanging  out that im going to have to run combat for  matt i feel your pain  laughter  audience member so i actually thought you would be a terrific person to ask if i could get up  here what are some of the ways that you raise the bar not 
none	 just in combat to make things  challenging for that amount of people  matt a general sliding scale i go for because adding just more hit points means it can go on for  a long time for scaling so i mean adding more hit points does help to have enemies have  longevity especially when you have that many players because thats a lot of damage that can  be dished out in a combat round my recommendation is to also increase the damage that can be done by  these creatures because youll get fewer rounds of 
none	 combat with more players but to still keep it  dangerous have the damage they take from certain attacks be large enough to the point where it  really is dangerous or conversely consider adding abilities to certain creatures that are  area of effect attacks you can customize any monster they come across the monster manual are  just templates and suggestions of how to run these things you can customize however you want  so if you want that beholder to be really nasty against nine players perhaps it has an eye wipe  ability that chooses to 
none	 do one eye ray attack on everything within a 20 foot radius how will that  do against nine players  audience member youre evil  matt im just saying there are ways you can customize creatures to be more of a threat to  multiple entities and yeah because a lot of single target attacks will be less effective  against larger groups think of ways that you can give them big sweeping attacks that can hit  multiple guys at once or things that can lock down and grapple multiple players at a distance  and make them 
none	 ineffective for a round or two like those are ways you can still make it  threatening for that many players without having to just give them 400 more hit points and it  becomes a huge slog fest  audience member thank you  mary we are out of time one more one more  matt one more one more  megan okay hi guys  mary and matt hi megan  megan hi  mary how are you  megan im good i know im trying to be quick best i can what is the biggest inspiring and 
none	  influentional of keyleth  mary of keyleth  megan and zahra  mary oh what was  matt most influential for your character  mary what was most influential for me wow  matt while you think about that for keyleth i know marisha for her it was partially avatar  the last airbender shes a huge fan of the series so when she created a druid she wanted to  go that elemental trying to learn to master different tribes of elemental types which has  been kind of a cool journey for her character also because marisha 
none	 as you may have noticed  shes a tough chick shes like really confident and thats why i like her you know  shes the fighter im the diplomat it works out fine she defends my honor  laughter  matt so for her she wanted to choose a character that was very against type for her she wanted to  play a character that was very different than what she would normally play or who she is so for  keyleth she wanted to make someone that was you know very awkward and insecure and trying to find  
none	 her place in the world and like with any dd character you learn a lot about yourself as you  play a character its hard to not be made a better person through these experiences and so  she attributes while that was her inspiration for keyleth keyleth has also been an inspiration  to her and shes learned to be more in touch with that aspect of herself as well so thats been  really inspirational for her  mary yeah  megan im much like keyleth im very awkward and have a lot of selfesteem issues as well 
none	  matt hey we all are in many ways i think we can all agree on that  mary its probably why we all get along so well for zahra i looked at all the different classes  and because again i was brand new to this world and i really looked at the group dynamic  and i thought whats missing whats not there so i saw okay warlock and then i was doing  research online mumbles i dont know if i should do that or not and somebody posted  something about you know badass tiefling warlock 
none	 and i said okay well theres no  tieflings there so lets try that and i found out as i went again as i said before i sort of  started with myself in terms of the personality and the moon and everything else and someone who  was i dont know i think shes kinder and more eloquent than i am you know so that helps me  you know because i can be sort of im from jersey i get a little brash every now and then  so i think shes a more elegant creature than i 
none	 am which is nice you know that will still use  the finger of death on keyleth within five minutes of a knockdowndragout she mentioned that the  other night i was like oh sorry marisha but yeah were not here to play tiddlywinks  were here to destroy  matt thank you  megan all right then thank you so much guys thank you  mary thanks megan thanks you guys im so sorry  matt so sorry if we didnt get to your question if you see us around the convention feel free to  stop us and 
none	 ask or come to another panel or come to our signing and ask us or shoot me a message  on twitter  mary im going to a signing right now so if you want to come down ive got some great kit buss  artwork of the kill shot on rimefang so come and check it out its really fun  matt thank you guys so much  mary bye guys thank you roll 20s  elevator music  soft music
