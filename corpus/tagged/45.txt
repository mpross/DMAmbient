was /none/ waiting and there was absolute silence wow this is what its like to have  respect  laughter  marisha 107 episodes later  matt thats all it took and its the last time itll ever happen  liam lulling you into a false sense of security  matt so anyway last we left off vox machina in facing the terrible threat of vecna returned to  physical form sent you all through this conflict to seek audiences with a number of the deities of  exandria after getting blessings and fragments of the essence of three of the gods /none/ you discovered  that vecna had completed the ritual of seeding and ascended into godhood however discussing with  ioun the knowing mistress it will take a little bit of time for him to both understand the extent  of his power to claim his domains and expand beyond his current condensed avatar form so time  is of the essence not to mention that in order to claim the full strength there needs to be a  showing of power and faith to gather attention and faith from the masses  so with that information you also imbued upon /none/ grog the ability to blacksmith and percival the  knowledge of the construct of these divine trammels things that could possibly be used to  seal and have been used previously to seal a god as killing them is a very difficult and dangerous  thing retrieving this information you discovered that the place where these can be crafted is called  the core anvil once belonging to the allfather the deity of construction design and  craftsmanship it resides beneath an underwater volcano known as scaldseat off the shore of a city  called shorecomb in issylra you also /none/ had a fantastic little runin with vecna recently  taunting you all  last we left off you had found yourself in vasselheim went to the trial forge to speak with  earthbreaker groon discovered what would be required to attempt to make contact with kord and  you made communion with the raven queen and in declaring your complete faith in her she offered a  piece of her essence to give you the third seed with which to make a third divine trammel and  with you all falling asleep within scanlans magnificent mansion you cast true polymorph /none/ on  yourself to take the form of a planetar and did whatever you did in that form as you all went to  sleep that evening  liam except that while he was checking out his junk in the mirror heavenly junk i shut the  door behind keyleth and i i dont think we should go another couple of days in silence  marisha has it been days  liam just barely  marisha feels like an eternity  liam i know that you are angry and i am just im sorry  marisha i was angry i /none/ was very angry and maybe if we had this conversation yesterday even i  might be yelling that to your face right now but its hard to be angry at bravery and selflessness  i mean weve always had the problem of you having one too many ladies in your life right laughs  its hard to compete with a god  liam ive done a lot of stupid things in my life and ive never had any regrets really i do know the  chance you took on me and ive confirmed your worst fears and then some  /none/ marisha its not your fault  liam regardless i am sorry and i regret that im not outright dead already and that you have to  stare at this walking pantomime of a life in front of you but kiki im grateful for the time i have  left to look on you and i am grateful to fight for your future and im grateful for that chance  you took on me  marisha i wouldnt take it back you taught me how to take chances laughs can i ask you a  question what exactly was the deal /none/ that you made with the raven queen was it when we slew vecna  or defeated him i have a feeling semantics are becoming increasingly more important  liam she offered me a way back and it was the only way back i wasnt coming back not after  that not without her blessing  marisha even if we found a way you wouldnt take it to reverse the deal im not asking im just  confirming  liam i dont want to leave but there are some things that i will not test hey i do have faith in /none/  her and i have faith in you and what youll do sighs god i feel so stupid  marisha its fitting really you can protect that plane ill be here to protect this one i  mean if these past few days have taught us anything its death isnt the end i just dont  want to forget if sprigg could forget the names of his party members that he died alongside he  ran never mind whats going to happen in a hundred or hundreds or even a thousand years i  dont want to forget this what /none/ if there comes a day when i dont even recognize the name vox  machina anymore  liam i dont believe that will happen youre going to live a long life yes and you will love  again and you will lead and you will be loved because who cannot love you  marisha i can name a few  liam no one of any worth  marisha im grateful for you and i always will be and im grateful for any second that we have  left and i dont want to spend any more being angry at you /none/ and im sorry that i was  liam you dont want me to go  marisha laughs of course not  liam hey im fucking cold will you give me a hug  marisha yeah its the weirdest thing by the way you being cold i mean its just something  to get used to  liam yeah  marisha yeah  liam i dont have any clever closer im just going to crawl into bed and go to sleep  matt okay both of you curl up and fall asleep the morning comes you all come to consciousness  /none/ within scanlans magnificent mansion and find breakfast of various grains and oats and quinoa  taliesin lentils  travis what do you mean lentils what is that what is a lentil is it a leaf is it a bean  taliesin no one really knows to be fair  travis why on gods green earth is it even here i dont understand  taliesin lentils are here to punish us  travis really  taliesin yes we have done something terribly wrong and now we must eat of these  travis that makes sense an hour from now when i /none/ get punished in the loo  taliesin we are punished by that  marisha im sorry this head cold mixed with crying is bad  laura it gets you right  matt yeah its rough  laura yeah thats what happened to me that day  marisha its the worst  sam well your voice is super sexy tonight so thats good  laura raspy singing smelly cat smelly cat  marisha raspy singing what are they feeding you  matt all right so as you finish your meals in the morning prepare yourself for the actions of  the /none/ coming day what do you wish to do  laura i dont fucking know  sam are we going to this volcano under the water  laura yeah right thats where we have to go  sam we need to be able to swim  taliesin and we need to be immune to poison  laura yes so if we have a heroes feast that will take care of one thing and i have two  chalices because we never used the one  sam we should save at least one for a certain fight  laura yes obviously  /none/ travis you can make us breathe underwater right  marisha yes i can  laura all of us even trinket  marisha unsure yes  laura and pike  matt well pike goes up yes dont forget i can prepare the feast for you guys that way you  dont have to spend a spell of yours for it as you guys are on this mission to go make this i can be  help i think i need to stay here for now to shepherd both the people in my temple of the  everlight with whatever words i /none/ can keep them calm under this chaos in the city  laura oh no pike but what if vasselheim is attacked  matt then i can let you know i also have a sending spell prepared so if anything happens i  can let you know immediately as long as youre on this plane  sam its so convenient  matt thats what clerics are here for she punches you in the shoulder  travis can i have something of yours at least until we see each other again  sounds of distress  matt of course grog and she /none/ comes up to you and let me see your axe real fast  travis ooh the bloodaxe  matt yeah  travis there you go mary poppins handbag  matt she hefts it and takes a little bit of her fading blue hair at the tip and carves off a  little piece of it hands the axe back to you and very deftly braids it into a small braid ties it  off and hands it to you  travis gasps its the sweetest thing ever  matt no but seriously dont eat it please  laura thats really /none/ creepy  matt grog no no  travis i tie it onto my necklace  matt okay please be safe and if anything happens im going to let you know as soon as  possible  liam oh man its going to hurt not to have you with us though oh well  matt you guys will be fine better we save our strength for whatevers out there  travis yeah and if vasselheim is attacked you dont go saving the city all by yourself  laura seriously  travis i know what youre like  matt why would i /none/ steal the fun from you  travis thats what i thought  matt okay  travis all right bye pike  laura wait no she has to prepare the heroes feast for us before we say goodbye  travis hi pike  matt you hand her the chalice and she prepares the feast within the mansion so what little bit  of for some of you may have been an unsatisfying breakfast this morning is quickly taken over by  the fantastically tasting feast of such a holy spread taking the hour to eat it all of you guys  /none/ get the benefits of heroes feast  travis no lentils right  matt there is a bowl of lentils for those who may want it  sam i had some  laughter  matt all right so as the heroes feast says here  laura immune to fear and poison and advantage on wisdom checks  marisha and you roll 2d10 extra  taliesin wisdom saving throws  matt im going to roll 2d10 for you guys  laura do you guys want food now or do you want to wait until the break  travis and matt lets wait /none/ until the break  taliesin well take a slightly early break in the long run  matt whoa two nines  cheering  matt thats lucky okay so there you go thats 18 additional hit points  laura that can regenerate  matt yes thats the maximum of your hit points for the next 24 hours so keep that in mind  folks  marisha yeah dope  laura how long do your inspiring speeches last  marisha oh that is an excellent question how long do my speeches  sam said kathleen turner  liam said harvey fierstein  /none/ laughter  marisha said katharine hepburn  matt inspiring leader a creature cant gain temporary hit points from this feat again until it  has finished a short or long rest so you have temporary hit points until your next long rest  essentially  marisha okay so can i double up on that  liam give us more hit points  matt you can itll be temporary hit points on top of that yes  marisha oh yeah  sam were probably not going to fight anything though  marisha since my voice is completely shot and i dont /none/ want to do a speech  travis yeah but we need it  marisha i am going to do  marisha and sam an interpretive dance  laughter  marisha of us swimming through the volcano and then going underground and shielding ourselves  and then fighting and then grogs forging the trammels  enthusiastic a cappella music  travis holy shit  liam still shouted narration through it all  laughter  matt wow that happened  taliesin im amazed that took over a hundred episodes ive been waiting for the interpretive  dance for a long time  /none/ laura yay how many did we get from that  matt so everyone gets 18 temporary hit points right  taliesin is that max goes up 18  matt no temporary hit points so as soon as you take damage they go away from the temporary  first temporary never come back then you have the maximum hit point bonus  taliesin so 18 max up and then an 18 on top of that that goes away once you get hit  liam but do i get sneak attack damage or is it also a critical hit  matt raven /none/ queen taketh away all right so as you guys are all sitting there watching keyleth  dance while she eats while youre eating its a unique display youre prepared for the rest of  your day pike says goodbye to everybody gives you a hug says be safe  sam pike will you do me a favor and will you get word to kaylie somehow  matt i can do that yeah  sam tell her dads okay and saving the world again  matt she goes done  marisha hey pike  sam i should have asked that long /none/ ago  matt probably yeah  marisha could you also do one of those to tary  matt right  sam well dont say dads okay saving the world again that wont make any sense to him  marisha tell him were all alive  laura tell him we love him and that were okay for the time being  sam especially scanlan hes probably really concerned  matt laughs you see this secondary dull flash and release of energy at her fingertips as she  finishes the glyph  taliesin are we doing this now  matt there we /none/ go we have food now  laura were doing it live can i have one slice of breakfast pizza  sam what is this a restaurant  travis jesus what the fuck  laura hes like hold on  liam pelor can i have one slice of breakfast pizza please  laughter  marisha this marker sucks balls  matt so pike makes her way toward her temple you guys are still within scanlans mansion what are  you doing  laura okay i guess we should exit the mansion and then  sam how are we traveling and where /town/ are we going  travis do we plane shift  laura above the water over to the volcano how do we do this  marisha its a bit away from vasselheim if i remember i did see a tree right that was near  the town  matt yep  marisha so yeah  laura okay so once were there do we know exactly what were doing  sam were diving down into the volcano forging some trammels  laura and the volcanos underwater is that what the schtick is with it  matt yes its on the floor and /none/ you can notice it because across this open clear ocean there is  one column of black smoke that emits from the waves  laura so its an active volcano that were diving into  taliesin underwater  laura solid  matt essentially  sam one question i have the infinite blessings of iouns knowledge i am a holy man however im  not exactly clear do we need those little peas to make these trammels and we have three of them  were not going to get more of these before we forge the trams  laura i dont /none/ think theres time  travis remember delilah was already down there she was in tunnels underground right  laura somewhere we dont know where exactly  travis we dont know if shes at this forge  laura no we dont know if shes there we dont know if shes with vecna  matt the vision that you had she was topside and there was snow  marisha yeah she was coming out of thar amphala  matt well tunnels that burrowed beneath the city of thar amphala  marisha and she was coming out she had both of her eyeballs /none/ back and was like ooh its  chilly bitch enjoying the winter snow  liam two regular eyes  marisha two regular eyes why do you think she keeps coming back gasps oh no  travis laura and liam what  taliesin youre nervous about everything is that what weve come to  marisha i dont know maybe she made a deal similar to the deals weve made but with vecna  taliesin i would assume so  marisha i mean if gods can give us their blessing why cant she have one  sam we should really tip 10 /none/  laura i know at least  sam you know be really generous  laura look at this you guys  travis so we go right do we go to the shore and then out into the ocean on a ship  laura we go to the shore then we climb up the volcano then we dive into the volcano  travis the volcano is underneath the ocean  laura but theres smoke coming out of it  travis underneath the ocean  marisha yeah a trail of black sooty bubbly goodness  travis weve only talked about it for /none/ four hours its okay  laura i thought maybe the top was coming out of the water  matt no its at the bottom of the ocean there are volcanoes underwater and this one is  less burning smoke its the sulfuric gases and poisonous fumes of the various reactions and  chemicals and pressure beneath  travis you never watched behind the scenes on titanic  laura i got it  sam how do we get there  travis we go to the shore  marisha well i have a tree i can get us there  sam okay /none/ lets do it  matt so with your things gathered you all find your way i imagine its not too far of a walk  from the ravens crest to a tree that is functional for this spell its on the southern  border of the quarter that holds the birthheart the orchards and various trees  there you find yourselves a suitable tree gather yourselves steel yourselves now that the morning  has come the tension in the air of vasselheim and the word that spreads of some sort of looming  threat though sourceless and directionless definitely has /none/ built this air of fear and rush for  preparation that surrounds you  travis i have a question sorry  matt yes  travis did pike come with us to send us off  matt ill say sure she walks you guys to the tree  travis pike you know you have whats it called you put on me one time that death ward should we  put that on one of us before we go just in case its super dangerous one of the squishier ones  does someone want death ward so if you go down  /none/ sam put it on vax  travis yeah no  laura i think either percy or i  liam pass  laura you  taliesin you  sam oh god just kiss already  taliesin we do  sam oh god they do  travis boulderparchmentshears perfect opportunity  taliesin flip for it heads or tails  marisha boulderparchmentshears  travis yeah come on  taliesin boulderparchmentshears  travis one time one two three go  marisha oh  laura you  sam boulder always wins  matt i can give it to a few people  laughter  laura /none/ thanks pike thats convenient  matt thats going to tap out my spells there im going to have to save some for sending just  in case  laura yes of course  travis those two  sam mr and mrs de rolo  matt okay thisll only last for eight hours so travel quickly  taliesin its mr and mrs vex lets be fair  travis thanks pike i thought it might help just in case  matt you too  travis nope nope i like a little danger in my life  laura is this going to be /none/ like the kraken fight are we going to be underwater fighting again  marisha i hope not  laura you werent there we almost fucking died because you werent there with us scanlan i  hated you at that moment  liam water under the bridge water under the kraken were on brighter horizons  matt as you guys are arguing she leans forward and beneath her breath finishes the incantation  with the death ward and you vexahlia it sounds like a soft clinging of gentle metals in the back  of your head and as it hits this /none/ warmth hits your chest and then it sets in it doesnt quite fade  its like having a localized blanket held to your sternum who else would like one  marisha how many does she get  matt ill say for the purposes of this she can muster four  laura scanlan  liam raspy voice how many does she get  marisha mafiastyle voice how many you got  travis do you want one  marisha yeah  laura if you die im going to be really upset  travis on my birthday come on what are the chances /none/  marisha hes got that whole barbarian knock me down i get back up again thing  laura i get the fuck back up again youre hercules mulligan  marisha thats why he would be a roguebarbarian i think  matt so for those four that have marked it you have death ward which lasts for eight hours the  first time you drop to zero hit points it brings you to one and then the spell fades  all right pike sends you off with a wave and you all step through the tree you feel the  transitional /none/ burst of energy as the druidic magics pull you from one living source to another and  you all emerge on the outside of a tree that is barely wide enough to sustain the doorway between  the two and as you all gather on the outskirts you turn around and you can see this  somewhatleafless living through the winter but not the prettiest tree youve seen the doorway  portal closes behind you  glancing around you there is a light snowfall and you can see slush and snow gathered dirty along  the edges of the streets /town/ you are on the outskirts of the city of shorecomb populationwise it  cant be more than a few thousand people at most it looks like theres a very healthy fish trade  to the immediate right of you theres a cliffside maybe 200 feet from the edge of the  town where there are carts going to and from you can the large crane carrying large containers and  large nets filled with caught fish from the bottom of the cliffside people around noticed you emerge  from a tree and you can see about four or five of /none/ the various peasants and working folk stop in  their tracks and stare at you frozen  liam i know weird right really weird  marisha hi  matt this way james and he grabs his little kids hand and the kid is slackjawed watching you  as he drags him off to the side people start walking again and still glancing over their  shoulder they go about their business keeping a very close eye  marisha maybe i should have found a tree less in the center of things  taliesin id rather be here  matt its /town/ not the center of town thankfully still off to the side but you did catch the eye  of a few folk  liam i mean you still transported us a long way thats commendable  taliesin how would one go about finding out if youre being watched via magical means is there a  way to do that other than if one is not a magic user is that a perception check  matt no there are actual spells designed for that  laura are there spells designed to mask you  marisha yeah i dont think any of /none/ us have them  sam to mask you from scrying  laura yeah so people cant see us do you know of anything like that scanlan  sam ive heard of such things but i dont currently have one  travis cool  taliesin just curious  travis good question  laura yeah because vecnas fucking watching us  travis right now  laura yeah all the fucking time  travis youre sure  laura yeah  taliesin yeah right over there  travis do we take a boat now or do we find some dolphins and ride out majestically /none/  laura are we on the water  marisha can we make our way to the shoreline  matt okay its a couple hundred feet to get to the edge of the cliff and these are sheer cliffs  that drop off for 150 200 feet or so before it hits very hard pebbled beaches these arent sandy  beaches  marisha i stop everybody saying be careful it looks like it could be a thousand feet which is  deceiving  travis you know youre only talking to yourself we all know  marisha a thousand feet is so /none/ long  liam so were on cliffs facing the ocean right now  matt yes you guys are at the edge of the cliff you look down and there are the rocky beaches  there are a number of large docks that jut out from the rocky beach and you can see there are  about five or six varying degrees of rickety winding wooden staircases that are built into the  cliffside that lead from the top edge of the cliff down to the beach below you can see a lot of  workers are currently hauling large sacks /none/ small crates and boxes things that are too small to  bring on the large winding cranes that they have on the edge as well there are ships coming there  are ships going it looks like this is a decent trade stop for cities along the shoreside here in  issylra  laura what do our elven eyes see can we see the smoke  matt make a perception check  laura that was a legolas reference in case you were wondering  liam im not familiar with that reference  laura a perception check  matt yes  /none/ laura 20  matt 20 glancing out at this distance the sky itself is very cloudy very gray its a very gray  day its cold its chilly the wind thats blowing is very faint but its enough to the point  where snow is falling there is a very faint mist in the distance either a storm is coming or a  storm has passed thats preventing you from seeing any sign of a glimmer of the smoke so youre not  entirely certain the direction  marisha can i tell if the storm is coming or the storm /none/ has passed  matt make a nature check  liam and there are people about  matt there are people about and some of them are just passing not paying mind and few of them  stop and glance at these very welldressed very dangerouslooking figures that have now just  walked up and look out past the ocean but no ones broaching any conversation they look like theyre  more making a wide berth or keeping a very untrusting eye on you as they walk past  liam druids doing interpretive dance again  matt so what did you /town/ get  marisha im a motherfucking human barometer  matt what did you roll  travis and marisha natural 20  matt oh shit okay  marisha yeah im really good at the check  matt you get the sense that a lot of the snow that was in the street when you got there and the  slush was from a storm that recently passed and the clouds and the fog that you see in the  distance it looks like its blowing away  liam you there little girl  matt okay laughing strangely no little girl is /none/ working at this dock however the person you  did see that looked like a little girl is actually a generally short fellow who has a wrap over the  top of his head a swollen cheek where it looks like he might have some sort of a tooth infection  who spins around its not a bonnet its a crusty looking fisherman who is like who are you  calling a little girl  liam oh my bad fellow sorry as you can tell were not from around here visiting yeah i had  a couple of questions one /none/ theres a volcano just off this coast somewhere right  matt aye  liam do you know where it is could you point to it  taliesin was that affirmative or surprise  matt points out to the ocean  laura is he pointing in a general direction i look where hes pointing can i see anything  matt no  laura damn it  liam are there boats for rent for hire  matt maybe yes i mean  liam all right thank you i think thats all i needed from you okay  laura i pull out a /none/ piece of gold do you know where the volcano is  matt yes what do you think im a dog what is this kind of treatment  laura do you want to make some gold  matt yes id love to make some gold  laura then can you tell me where the fucking volcano is  matt there we go straight questions he rubs his swollen cheek side you can see his teeth are  graying and yellow theres a little bit of blackened decay at the edges but he grins a little bit  at the sight of /none/ the gold i need a little more than that paltry sum  laura paltry sum how much gold do you see every day i pull out another piece is this enough  matt make it five and ill introduce you to my docksmen  laura all i want to know is where the volcano is  matt but youre not looking for a ship to rent right like he said  laura no  matt all right sniffles volcano is that way and he points out you see he glances over he  lines up where you can see a /none/ couple of larger rocks that are breaking out from the shore surface  maybe 20 or 30 feet out from where the pebble beach ends and meets the water line hes lining  up his arm and that way about five miles  marisha five miles  travis hey use your elven eyes see if you can see it  laura yeah im going to look real hard were a thousand feet up  matt still its too hard to see right now  laura cant we spell ourselves out there  marisha well  taliesin we might want that /none/ later  marisha i mean we could we can  laura we should rent a ship  taliesin if we get a ship then when its all over we have a way out  travis otherwise were walking five miles underwater  marisha i would rather save my 8thlevel animal shapes in case we need to bail  laura all right heres three more gold how about that introduction  matt that i can muster puts the coins in a little pouch in the side and buttons it up and  locks it all right follow me  sam whats /none/ your name young lady  matt fenna  sam fenna pleasure to make your acquaintance  matt you as well lass  marisha i love fenna in my salads  matt leads you guys back down one of the winding stairways and you have to wait at certain  moments there are certain areas where it switchbacks and its open you would think its a  platform for looking out but its more for letting people get past and for the pathways up  and down it gets narrow on the actual stairs but eventually you make your way down /town/ to where these  docks are and there are three large buildings that are the hubs of most people checking in  checking out they have a number of docksmen that are keeping tabs on whats going in and out of the  dock and what materials are being shipped in taxing those that are using it temporarily  general business in the vicinity he leads you over now then im going to introduce you to  senth she can rent you something at the very least i recommend not letting that one in she  has a thing against /none/ the smaller folk  liam oh shit  sam oh im being racisted against  matt look im not you seem like a very fine lady  sam touché fenna touché  matt but i know senth well and if you want to make a good impression maybe keep her outside  laura youre not the tallest yourself you know  matt stretches his lower back with a couple of cracks and snaps the hunched man gets about four  five inches of height and is almost cresting about vax height  travis look scanlan the necklace is really nice /none/ on the inside i can vouch for it  sam im not going into the necklace  travis why not new experiences right whatever it takes to achieve the mission  laura fuck it fuck it im not disguising him because of what he looks like fuck that  sam are you standing up for me  laura of course i am  marisha i would like to argue he just disguised himself for a solid year  laura i dont care that was a different reason and if your fucking dock mistress is such a bitch  that she /none/ wont give us a good deal because of him then well find someone else  matt fair enough i would also recommend you lower your voice were right outside of her  door  marisha wait whats her name  matt senth  marisha senth  sam its really easy i dont mind putting on the hat  marisha it is the principle but do we have time for principles  taliesin we have time for principles immediately afterwards when we come back  liam we never have before why start now  laura i mean its up to you /none/ but i dont think you should do it  sam no lets stand on principle  taliesin oh no  matt are we done here  taliesin oh youre still here  matt good day  travis thanks for your time  matt hobbles off and makes his way back up the stairs so you come outside to this one dock hub  its a modest twostory building looks like it has like a watch tower second story and the bottom  floor is much larger the door is currently closed the wood looks a little searotted you  can /dung/ see the edges of the wood are curling and dark and perpetually damp little bits of green moss  and various fungus are starting to gather at the very edges of the building but it seems to be  standing and has been there for a while  taliesin knocking sound  matt you knock on the door a voice inside goes come in  taliesin door creak i dont know why i made the sound effect  matt thats okay as you push the door open glancing inside theres general gray dull  daylight coming from the cloudy sky /none/ but there are also a few oil lanterns hanging in  different places you can see stacks of maps or other heavy pieces of parchment that are curled up  and tied off in sections there are small crates most of them empty that are scattered about the  entranceway here and as you enter the building you watch as a very tall thin lanky female  halforc spins around across the room with a singular monocle that is very very intense to  make one eye look really big over the other spins around sides of the head shaved /none/ and the rest of  it slicked back against the head with a little bit of a light brown shock against the black to one  side dressed fairly nice but you can see the clothing at an immediate glance is nice upfront  and then tatters at the bottom spins around yes  taliesin we were hoping to charter a ship at great expedience to about five miles off the coast  to the plume of smoke and the underwater volcano  matt you watch as the one eye moving independently of the other glances and looks each  /none/ of you very quickly up and down and then slicks back into place that can be arranged yes  taliesin excellent  matt how long would you wish to charter this ship  travis three days  laura sure yeah probably be less than that but three days sure  matt do you have a crew  taliesin no we would need to  sam can any of us sail  travis not if we want to live  taliesin we would like to charter a crew also to maintain were going to be doing a bit of  underwater /none/ search and rescue so  matt very well then  sam will that be possible  matt yes  laura great wonderful  matt three days rental including a crew on board thatll run you approximately 150 gold  pieces i require to be in case you lose the ship or dont return with it an additional 500 to hold  in case you lose the ship so a grand total of 650 up front with 500 to be returned upon your  return  laura of course and you have something to sign im sure percival can draw something /none/ up  matt oh but of course i would not dream of allowing such a thing without a paper trail  taliesin that will do  matt follow me a quick contract is drawn up you take a glance over it percival seems very  thorough but nothing beyond what was requested and basically if the ship is not returned all money is  forfeit when the ship is returned a very intense investigation and perceived state of the ship is  going to be requested from an appraiser to see if any damage was taken yeah its essentially like /none/  one of those seedy car rental places that the contract says they will ding you for every  damage  laura how much do ships normally cost  taliesin i dont know  laura 600 is very low  sam i feel like weve rented a ship before  laura but it was far less than this  taliesin it was far less than this but at this point im saying lets blow the money  laura yes of course i agree but an entire ship i feel like would be more than 600  travis we priced it /none/ out once before and it was like 30000  laura yeah so shes giving us a really good deal  sam maybe its a shitty ship  marisha i mean thats fine id prefer a shitty ship if its cheaper  matt slaps the contract down in front have we a deal  taliesin i dont mind  matt very well  sam would you take this as a deposit i give her this platinum bracelet with a sapphire that i  have well get it back when we return the ship oh wait  laura maybe you should amend /none/ that in the contract  matt the one eye is still looking at you the other is buzzing in front of the bracelet i  find this acceptable in our agreement  sam but wait it just occurred to me as i was handing that over we need platinum dont we that was  platinum wasnt it  laura yeah  sam maybe well just do gold instead sorry can i have that back sorry  liam smooth operator  laughter  matt flings it back and there is an expression of of course a gnome would do that if /none/ this  was a telltale game it would say her hatred for gnomes deepens  laura thats fine bling  matt all right immediately puts it into a small shelf writes down some remarks on it very  well i will show you to the shore shanty follow me please  laura oh it sounds elegant  travis shantys a fancy name for a mansion right  matt leads you out to one of the far end docks and there are a number of decent ships and larger  fishing ships some fastertravel ships some long boats you see one /none/ galleonsized ship thats just  left and taken away and on the far end there is one of the shittiest tugboatsized boats youve  seen in a while scanlan youve seen boats like this and theyre largely used for either  relatively cheap and relatively quick messenger services a courier ship if you will thats  about it  sam do we need a bigger vessel  laura i have a feeling you dont believe this ship will make it back do you  matt well that would not behoove me i wish to keep my ships at dock where /none/ theyre safe  laura of course yep  marisha shes got a highass insurance policy on this bitch  taliesin clever  matt the crew is included go say hello hope to see you back in a few days whips around and  walks her way back  travis did you see her eye it didnt move how does that happen  sam she seemed very pleasant dont know what  fenna was talking about shall we away do we  need to make any preparations before we go  taliesin i think were ready  sam do we have /none/ all of the materials we need  taliesin did we get the platinum from the bank if i recall im trying to remember  matt yeah well say that that was your intent last time that you made the conversion to  platinum  taliesin we wouldve platinumed  travis lets meet the crew  marisha oh boy  travis how many crew are there  matt there are three two of them appear to be the crustiest barnacles the gentleman that you  met earlier fenna looks like the brother of these two that mated that really lived the /none/ life  both of these men that are inside thatre playing cards hunched over the table cant be younger  than their early sixties one of them has a big thick gnarled white beard that darkens at the  tips which you can only imagine as most hair tends to get lighter at the tips means its  crusted with stuff theyre both wearing general seafaring garb and tattered clothing theyre  muscular their skin is very tanned one of thems wearing a heavy knitted cap that folds back onto  itself and rests on his shoulder to the side /none/ they are both playing cards and they look over i  guess its time to work takes the cards pulls them up from the table all right where we  going  laura you strapping young lads are taking us out to the volcano  travis yeah scaldseat  matt both look at each other all right lets wake up santy  marisha santy shanty  matt and sam santy  travis the name of the boat is the sea shanty but the captain is santy  matt santy of the shanty technically this is captain santy of the shore /dung/ shanty  laura the shore shanty  matt yeah its a mouthful  laura captain santy of the shore shanty i love it  matt you watch as this large gentleman walks over and slams his fist on this small wooden ugh my  brain isnt working thank you a hatch in the ground weve got customers and you hear this  rustling beneath and all of a sudden the hatch slams up and barreling out from underneath you  see the drunkest most unshaven unwashed gnarled goliath youve ever seen no facial hair but bits  of frizzled dark /none/ hair in the back which is interesting very few goliaths grow hair now  whats interesting about this too is the size isnt as large as you heightwise but width  is about matching yours so this is a bowling ball of a goliath steps up on the top grunts  laura only taller  liam a large danny devito  matt actually yeah thats a good point but if danny devito also was doing iron man competitions  for a number of years and then let himself go so he has the bulk of the muscle underneath but  /dung/ then yeah doesnt say a word just looks at you all and then walks out onto the deck of the ship  laura great  travis can i look down into the hatch where he came from can i see anything  matt make a perception check  liam were just going from point a to point b this is just what we need  travis two  matt it is dark but you can smell the rum  travis theres rum down there down there there is rum  marisha well we have five miles ahead of us  /none/ travis lets get shithoused who cares what our responsibilities are  laura how long would it take to go five miles on this fabulous ship  matt well one of the two older gentlemen that were there the one that knocked on the hatch  goes hums sticks his hand out the side of the doorway maybe two hours three hours  marisha ugh no im going to go fix with that whatever you know what im saying wind noises  travis we havent even left the dock yet  matt they pull the sail up they get everything ready /tavern/ they go ahead and undock from the dock  pull up anchor and the general wind because its cliffside here the wind is pretty strong right  here at the bay so immediately the sail billows open and the ship takes off and they begin to  curve in the direction loosely of where you were pointed earlier  marisha after those initial winds i take them and keep us going for a little bit  laura im going to keep an eye on where the little guy said the volcano was and try to make  sure our drunk /none/ captain is taking us to the right place  travis after all we are going on a threehour tour  marisha actually it should be only about half an hour now  sam ooh theres sound effects first of all appreciate the sound effects if were going on a  threehour tour i demand to know whos gilligan whos the skipper millionaire and his wife the  movie star  taliesin ginger  sam ginger yeah  marisha well then theres the professor and mary ann yeah well you may be the professor so  maybe youre mary ann does /none/ that make me ginger  liam well wait wouldnt you be thurston howell iii  taliesin i feel like i would really be thurston i feel like thurstons better  marisha yeah actually yeah  laura youre mary ann youre professor  liam this is going to be very helpful against vecna  matt youre the crazy monkey on the island that kept fucking shit up  sam little buddy  matt all right as you set sail the wind picks up speed is enhanced and you gather at this rate  probably in under two hours youll probably make /none/ it to the destination with the help of the air  ashari  marisha its a 2ndlevel spell gust of wind  matt so as it guides on captain santy stands at the front of the ship glancing out this giant  square jaw just nestled right into where the pecs meet up beneath the thick sweater thats almost  hanging off the arms at this point no cap balding head with the scraggly hair in the back  and just looks off in the distance the rest of the two are just sitting back where there are  various /none/ jugs of some unseen liquid keeping tabs on the sail its a very leisurely lackadaisical energy  on this ship  liam how many feet i guess is this ship from front to back  matt front to back id say its about 25 feet  sam were crammed on this thing  matt this is a tiny ship its 25 to 30 feet  laura theres no way to go any faster on this is there no way to go faster captain  matt captain you say this to the captain he goes  laura do you go out /dung/ to this volcano often lovely  marisha santy is so wise  travis why do you say that  marisha he sees the sea look at him  taliesin we can all see the sea its right there  marisha santy of the shanty seas sees the sea  matt and he points out and you glance out at where santy of the shore shanty is and you can see  in the distance theres a little line of dark that is rising out of the ocean  laura oh you found it  taliesin santy of the shore shanty /dung/ spotted  travis i will throw something  marisha do you think santy of the shore shanty sells sea shells  taliesin surely not  matt rocks fall everyone dies  quickly enough you begin to approach and you can now see what was a thin column is now a fairly large  billowing stream of dark fume that you can see as the waves get larger and larger the  further out you go certain swells some of it breaks up and it chains and snakes upward based  on how its finding its way to the surface eventually /none/ you get within maybe 30 40 feet of  where it breaks the surface there and the sails fall into loose and are tied around the bottom  anchor is thrown off the side chain is let down and then eventually the captain turns back and  laura and sam all right  travis jeez hold on i saw you drop anchor do you have an idea of how deep it is here  matt glances over the side  laura very deep is your chain long enough for your anchor to hit bottom cool  liam im sorry do /none/ you do you talk ever  matt as soon as you say that question the two other older gnarled gentlemen on the ship go  noises of warning captain is just staring at you spits spits on the ground before you  marisha i see youre also skilled in interpretive dance youre very good  travis oh shit the ship will be gone when we come back up  liam i dont wanna waste time on the gnome business lets just go on  sam lets do this  marisha water breathing  laura oh and trinket  marisha and /none/ trinket poof  laura i had him in the necklace because it was such a tiny little boat but now hes out  matt yeah all right with that you all have water breathing  laura oh wait can he swim hes good he did it before right  matt yeah hes as good at swimming as half of your party  laura hes an expert now after the kraken fight  sam what  taliesin im so glad i dont have to do that you just do it for me its very nice  marisha keyleth uses alter self /dung/ to give herself the gill hands the webbed fingers again that was  cool  travis you got to do a proper paddy entry into the water splash  matt perfect as each of you make your way into the water splashing you can smell by the way  the fumes because you see the dark color of it you immediately envision or at least  instinctively prepare for the smell of fire smoke or a fireplace as soon as it hits you its a  very acrid sharp metallic smell with hints of sulfur and other chemicals that burn /dung/ the inside of  your nose and sinuses immediately  liam in the water going up our noses  matt its the proximity being near you can smell occasionally as the wind blows through a  whiff gets to you you all make your way under the surface and begin to swim down following with  your vision where the source of this dark column of fume is  travis do we have good visibility  matt its all right  travis 40 feet 60 feet  matt id say about 60 feet or so before it gets a little /none/ murky  taliesin i think ive still got one more charge on the flashlight if i recall  matt okay  laura the red light  taliesin yeah  matt all right so you guys make your way down below whos leading this i should get a marching  order for underwater by the way  liam i will go ahead  laura im useless and percys useless underwater  taliesin extremely useless  matt percy has the light too  taliesin ill be in the middle  marisha ill be with percy more up front  matt all righty /none/  laura ill be just behind percival  matt all righty grog  travis where should i be  matt youre sinking faster than most anybody  travis yeah how about im the downweighter system for whoevers in the front ill hold onto  their ankles  matt is trinket in your necklace or swimming as well  laura hes out hes swimming  matt okay so trinkets trying to keep up next to you scanlan where are you  sam im probably next to percy  matt all right so you guys begin making your way down you can /none/ breathe the water just fine as you  descend 40 60 feet 80 feet  laura im equalizing  travis youre breathing water its not necessary  laura really your ears wouldnt pop still  travis theres no air in your sinuses  laura oh right okay cool  matt its funny you mention equalizing and i cant help but try and do it myself now  travis quick question like in space can we talk underwater if theres no air going through our  vocal cords cool  laura oh good we cant communicate  matt ill say because /none/ you have the earring its a little garbled but you can hear it a little  bit  marisha its like that game we all played when we were growing up  matt you can make out the gist of things but depending on how fast youre talking it could be  hard to hear its getting darker and darker the further down you descend and the water gets  murkier and murkier it also gets warmer  travis stop peeing vax  matt chuckles i was waiting for it  laura you called him vex  liam vax and /none/ i said sorry at the same time so im peeing right now is what im saying  matt its good it leads you into it descending further and further the only visible light that  you have is the one that percival is shining below and as it goes through you can see it  reveals another 40 or so feet ahead of you and then as you pass over it suddenly becomes shorter  and then longer again as it comes and hits the smoke and you can see the smoke and the fume now  its billowing up /dung/ at a rapid pace and the water is getting hotter and hotter to the point where  now its starting to feel like a sauna  laura garbled we didnt think about fire resistance did we  matt about another 20 or so feet and its hot enough to stand but its getting really  uncomfortable and with percivals light you can see the bottom soft impact you guys all land  there at the bottom of the ocean its so dark that outside of percivals light and the glow  around you you only see the outline of each /none/ other from the splashback of the light as he projects  it around  laura does anybody have any light  marisha i can light up my flame hands  travis and matt youre underwater  marisha but its magic i thought it doesnt matter  matt i will say you get a little bit there and its fighting against it its a very faint glow  you can see where keyleth is but it doesnt add any light to the rest of this  travis and liam garbled noises  laura we really need to say stuff though because /none/ no ones going to be able to understand  us  laughter  travis do you see anything around us  matt make a perception check  taliesin i may join in on that because i have a flashlight  liam 28  matt you guys both have disadvantage on this by the way because of the lack of visibility  liam 28  laura scanlan dont you have dancing lights or anything  taliesin 21  sam i can make a fireball garbled i can make a fireball but it will probably go out really  quick  laura /dung/ garbled dont you have a dancing lights cantrip or some shit like that  sam garbled no  laura garbled lame  matt all right so glancing down you can see you guys are standing on a rising upward cone the top  of the volcano at this point where you can see all the ground below you especially immediately  around where the water or the fume is gushing out is porous dark rock theres no soot theres no  soft surface that you hit theres no usual bottom of the ocean you expect yeah no sediment its  /none/ just hard rock the force of the vents seems to be pushing any of the sediment off and it descends  slowly around you and disappears into the darkness  you can see a number of small strangely enough with the heat of the surrounding area too you  can see little bursts of color within the porous rock and with a quick glance vax you can see  there are bits of plant life colorful pinks and purples that are slowly pulled into the porous  rock on the outside of these vents you can see a very faint /none/ glow in a couple of places of the rock  where it looks there is still some sort of very hot very slow pressurizing molten rock that is  cooling slowly it looks like theres this constant slow battle between the ocean water and  whatevers forcing upward  marisha do i see any garbled do i see  matt whispering dont please  laughter  matt please dont  liam it sickens me  laughter  marisha are there any pockets other than the main pressure point that might be a smooth entry  point  matt right now /none/ where its emerging these jets of extremely hot fume that are billowing past you  it looks like theres one concentrated opening at the moment as you walk around it looks like its  not one central column it looks like theres a number of smaller fissures that are all clustered  around this area and its hard to see the separation because so much of its mashing into  one giant column as it emerges  marisha okay yeah all right so its hot water and gas coming up if i theoretically wanted to do  a control water /none/ spell and reverse the water inwards could we go in through one of these  tunnels through one of these fissures  matt you can certainly try  taliesin i hate that phrase  travis youve got the death ward go for it  marisha im more thinking for all of us i dont know how else were going to get in  laura can you make yourself a fire elemental and it wont damage you if you go or will water fuck  with you  matt oh water will fuck with you as a fire elemental  marisha /none/ i could be a water elemental though  matt you could  travis should we walk around the volcano is it massive  matt you dont know your visibility vanishes about 40 feet away from you  liam and were just seeing little glows in the distance  matt youre seeing little glows within the actual areas where the fumes are spewing up youre  seeing down where the smoke is emerging youre seeing every now and then a faint glow that  appears here and there  taliesin are the faint glows repetitive like theyre coming from the same /none/ place over and over  again  matt yeah it looks like the glow is stationary its just the smoke obscuring it as it passes by  and occasionally gives you a glimpse  taliesin lets head towards the glow  laura yeah it might be magma coming out though  travis there are tunnels that exist already  taliesin it might be magma also if we see anything resembling an air bubble then we know  theres something that breathes  marisha if we want to wait a few minutes i could do a commune with nature  laura /none/ yeah do that thats smart yeah  marisha im going to be like underwater tea party glugging and do a commune with nature for  a little bit i get three questions i want to find any easy tunnels  laura manmade tunnels  marisha manmade tunnels that arent going to bake us alive  laura any dangerous creatures in the area  marisha any dangerous creatures in the area thats good and the anvil okay  matt because of the nature of this the radius is limited to 300 feet because its considered a  somewhat underground not outintheopen /none/ setting  marisha all right yeah 300 feet  matt all right so you take the minute and concentrate beneath and with that all of a sudden  you feel your conscious extend into the rock and stone and the various forms of plant life that  have made home around the outskirts of the top of this volcanos caldera your questions are  marisha are there any manmade tunnels that will grant us access into the volcano without burning  us alive  laura and where are they  marisha and where are they  sam thats two questions /none/  matt no  travis manmade is not important  sam how about any tunnels  marisha are there any tunnels getting into the volcano  matt you feel the sense of the rock and the surrounding material guide your attention very  focused into the center of where that fume is erupting  taliesin oh okay  liam the anvil is probably too far away at this point yeah its probably not right here at the  top what about these colorful plant things floating past us are they going to sting us and  paralyze us  sam /none/ should we find out from nature how far down in the magma it is  travis yeah what the location of the anvil is  marisha im afraid that 300 feet  laura but maybe itll know how far away it is even though it can only does it work that  way  marisha within 300 feet i can see the area  laura oh okay  liam said the fantasy heroes  marisha yeah hostile creatures hostile creatures in the area  matt hostile creatures in the area  marisha dangerous hostile creatures how many more adjectives can /none/ i throw in there  liam pissy  taliesin irritated creatures  travis starving  marisha do harm ill will  matt terrain bodies of water prevalent plants minerals animals or peoples powerful celestials  fey fiends elementals or undead you do get a very faint sense of elemental movement youre not  quite sure what that pertains to specifically but it is moving just outside the radius of your  sphere of understanding here at the top of the volcano and it is moving slowly through rock  laura there you go  sam through rock  marisha earth /none/ elemental  laura so we need to go in the top yeah  travis or through rock you can make tunnels right  marisha i can make tunnels  travis i would prefer to do that than go down the barrel of the shotgun but thats just me  sam travis can you say that with your finger flapping on your mouth please  travis garbled no  laughter  marisha are we concerned if i start boring tunnels into the side of this that magma and  pressure will start releasing out the side  travis im just saying /none/  sam hes just saying  liam vax swims down towards the cone and i think the last time i talked about the deathwalkers  ward id set it to fire so well say fire  sam immune to or resistant to  matt resistant to  marisha is my mantle helping with the heat  matt yeah the heat isnt bothering you as much it helps with extreme heat as a general weather  type but intensely dangerous heat like fire or anything its not going to help you with that so  you dive into the center  /none/ travis yeah i forgot hes like a crash test dummy well worry about that later  matt you watch as vax disappears into the liquid the pressure is a lot i need you to make an  athletics check first  liam okay thats what im best at athletics natural 20 thanks matt colville  matt you swim down into the darkness and youre using your sense of balance to keep tabs on what is  up and what is down because once you dive into the middle of this pillar you see nothing and you  begin to swim /none/ down feeling for where the gravity is pulling you and the force against you and use  that to get your bearings  liam i know its probably fuckall but im going to pull out the flametongue dagger and try to use  it as a shittyass  matt you can faintly see a little bit of it there you do take three points of fire damage as  soon as you enter the water reduced to one so you manage to push through and descend about 15 or  so 20 feet you suffer another six points of fire /none/ damage reduced to three need you to make  another athletics check please as youre pushing further and further down  liam use my first luck of the day oh not good same thing just a six  matt a six it begins to push you up you lose a little bit of ground you take another  one point of fire damage you begin to make up and you get partway down you get another 40 or so  feet down into it you think still unable to really see anything occasionally you see a glint  of that /none/ light that you saw before the little bit of glow you take another three points of fire  damage reduced to one it is a lot of heat but you continue to push further make another  athletics check a third one  liam 20 total  matt 20 grunting pushing along still making your way down making your way down you get  probably another 80 or so feet before it seems to curve off a little bit to the side the force of  the water begins to shift a little bit you take another three points of /none/ fire damage you begin to  see a faint bit of that glow that you were following earlier and as you head towards it the  heat gets more and more intense you begin to push past some of the smoke and you can see right  there looks like theres a glowing ember of rock about five or six feet wide that is molten rock  that is slowly cooling as its being pushed faintly out but the force of the water curves off  to the side and you continue to swim away from where that glowing ember /none/ is and following the path  of where this push of water is you take another two points of fire damage  liam okay im ed harris sinking down and down and down  matt the temperature is going up you continue to swim continue to swim further down  further down further down make another athletics check  liam 16  matt okay youre slowing down a bit but youre still getting ground you also take another  three points of fire damage this is getting hard  liam yeah  matt and even your form youre getting a /none/ little tired having to go against this force and youre  not quite sure where this is going to lead you youre not going to stumble across an opening  where its fine to walk youre continuing to swim down a superheated  liam im going to push it just a little bit more  matt okay make another athletics check  liam okay thats not good thats a seven  matt okay you get pushed back about 15 feet or so and you take another three points of fire  damage  liam and ill go with it up /none/  matt okay you ride up before you can get entirely out of the column you take another three  points of fire damage and eventually emerge from the side of it uncomfortable  liam back into warm piss water instead of boiling hot  matt yes which comparatively is much more comfortable  liam nope  travis what did you see  liam i mean you cant really understand me though can they right its all shit  laura oh we can understand you  matt you have the earring on  liam it goes forever i think we /none/ need to look elsewhere i dont think all of us are going to  make it down that fucking tunnel  marisha what if im controlling the currents  liam sighs that would help it was getting hot as hell down there i dont know i mean maybe a  quick look around the perimeter of this thing  marisha i didnt find anything  travis yeah but it might be worth it we dont even know what the core anvil looks like  taliesin we have a broom  liam were not going to muscle our way down  /none/ laura no it doesnt do anything in it flies  taliesin does it not work underwater  laura i can try but it flies  travis i mean no  matt you can certainly try  laura yeah itll just sit  liam well i think were either druiding our way in or looking for another way in somehow  laura fuck how long did that take  matt he was gone for about a minute minute and a half  sam i have an idea what if i could make us a tunnel straight down the middle would the /none/ heat  kill us or would the water tamp down the heat if i can make a tenfoot wide tunnel all the way  through down  laura with no water  travis it might make another exhaust port for the heat and the water  marisha thats what i was saying im afraid of the pressure  sam the pressure of what once it comes up it becomes rock oh i see theres more underneath  travis you didnt see tunnels right you didnt see tunnels in the sides of the volcano  liam no  travis because were /none/ not trying to go down were trying to find the tunnels  sam what tunnels  travis and laura there are tunnels here  matt both percival and scanlan make an intelligence check please  sam just a straight intelligence check  matt just whatever you roll plus your intelligence modifier  sam eight  taliesin 14  matt 14 on this discussion of burrowing deeper within if there were any places where you could  walk that were not completely filled with water per se the minute you exposed it it would  begin to fill with water which /none/ means youd have think of a way to either plug it or just stay wherever  water exists within the system beneath  travis right i dont know if were trying to get to the inside of the volcano shaft  marisha our water breathing lasts for 24 hours  taliesin lets roll around a little bit see if we can see anything else  laura maybe we can go around the perimeter and  see if we can find some sort of entrance some  magicallooking entrance  marisha scanlan your burrowing what means are you using for that /none/  sam magic  marisha touché  sam sorry miley cyrus  travis theres a chance the core anvil could be made of molten rock right theres nothing that  says its a not dangerous totally cool to be around piece of thing  marisha i have a feeling thats exactly what it is its going to suck working around that thing  sorry  travis im not worried about it well weve got to find whatever it is we dont even know what it  looks like  laura do you know percival what it looks like did you /none/ see it in your minds eye  matt you only have the construct of the actual trammel not the anvil  travis yeah when i was getting the upload from morpheus did i see what the core anvil might look  like or was it just like im just hammering and rambo 2 montage music is playing  matt more that  marisha scanlan  sam yes  marisha okay can we tagteam this  sam all right i can be a burrowing monster  marisha okay what if you burrow and i push the water away  sam is /none/ that a spell  marisha yeah control water i can push it away and if you do that then maybe we can all get in  and then maybe i can throw up a wall  sam all right i can burrow you can deflect water and stuff  laura through the mountain through the volcano instead of down the top like he just did  sam whatever you want  marisha or i can control the currents and suck us all right through down the top  taliesin i like control the currents i dont know  sam but /none/ the currents cant go down because stuff is coming out no  marisha as part of control water i can reverse the currents  sam but you cant control the lava coming up  marisha no its water and gas and pressure  sam oh its just gas its not lava  matt you can also part water dont forget as a part of this too you can also part water  marisha i can also part water like fucking moses  matt yeah or redirect flow or create a whirlpool there are all things you can do  laura /none/ solid then lets try it  liam what were you thinking were you thinking of umbrasyling this shit were you going to black  dragon dig your way down  sam i was going to become a purple worm theyre excellent at burrowing and are big and could make  a big tunnel  laura are they resistant to water and heat  sam no but they are stacked with hit points  laura solid  marisha that would be one of your toplevel spells yeah  sam the toppest  laura lets not do that just yet lets control /none/ current and see if we can fucking do it with some  light this time  travis we need a walk walk the perimeter  marisha i mean we can still walk the perimeter if you want  liam i mean we got a little under 24 hours fuck it lets look  marisha we can walk the perimeter  taliesin lets do a little walk of the perimeter and when were ready were going to jump down and  well mary poppins it  matt okay so you guys begin to make your way around spiraling the outside of /none/ this  taliesin looking using the light  matt okay what are you looking for  taliesin im looking for other expelling gasses interesting plant growth lights  liam anything that looks notnatural  travis yeah caves  matt okay everyone whos looking make an investigation check  marisha investigation natural 20  cheers  travis oh minus two 17  taliesin 14  liam 18  laura ten  matt as you guys are glancing about for over the next 15 or so minutes just swimming around and  keeping an eye out there keyleth with your glowing hands /none/ and cruising across as you head  down you can feel a couple of other small changes in the current less of a fume release more than  there is a warmer area of water in a small area and you find there is a pressurized jet of water  coming out of one section maybe about 25 to 30 feet down on the side  laura hey youre smart grog  marisha how big is the jet  matt id say its between about three feet long on one side and about a foot long on the other  /none/ its a fissure  laura so we can get through it  marisha yeah can grog fit  matt no  marisha okay  taliesin but can trinket fit  matt no trinket or grog neither of them can fit most of you guys have to squeeze through and  its as hot as the water that was coming out of the top  marisha is it made out of stone can i call this earth can i call this rock  matt its considered rock its volcanic rock  marisha so move earth would not work  taliesin or /none/ grog can punch it  laura yeah grog can punch  marisha you are good at destroying structures  sam youre going to punch a volcano  matt yeah dirt sand or clay so im going to say no  marisha can i transmute the rock into dirt or sand to give us a little more  matt if you have a means of doing that you could  marisha i have transmute rock or we can let grog go first  taliesin lets let grog punch a volcano  matt you want to punch a volcano  travis kind /none/ of  taliesin teach it to say your name  matt roll a strength check  travis garbled say my name bitch  laura dont you get advantage  travis i do only if im raging  matt ill give you advantage on this because its a volcano punch  travis hey oh 26  laura dont you get advantage because of your gauntlets  matt well no the gauntlets dont give him advantage but they do give him siege and he does  double damage against structures and ill consider this a natural structure you rear back and as /dung/  you do you guys watch you havent really watched him use this type of power in the dark before and  you watch as the faint bit of a few yellow runes glow as he pulls back and then slams into the side  and you watch as rock breaks and bits of the volcanic rock break off and begin to tumble down  the sides he punches again and punches again and as you do watch the water flow you feel the  warmth come up you immediately take six points of fire damage from the heated jet /none/ in front of you  but as you slam it one more time part of it rock collapsing gives away underneath as one side of  it begins to jet up you watch as it looks like there is a gap or an air pocket that collapses inward  and the water begins to fill in immediately  laura lets get in quick and then cover it we go fast go in  matt okay you guys are all fighting against the current  laura well didnt you say there was an air pocket  matt well there was an /none/ air pocket that you saw but the stone as he punched in as soon as it  collapsed inward it was away from where the jet was its a very interesting thing to try and  describe here in a theater of mind scenario  marisha were trying to go through an outward jet to this cavedin air pocket  matt yeah essentially youve opened up where the jets strength has diminished a little bit at  the surface at this point and youve watched as youve punched and there will be another chamber  below that was an air /none/ chamber collapsed inward and ocean water is rushing into it right now  marisha okay okay let me control water with the current and can i redirect the current up and  around us to allow us to get in  matt okay so control water takes an action to cast so as soon as that happens you finish the  spell and as the ocean water begins to rush in water rushing it immediately pulls back out  and you can actually stop the current thats blowing upward and heated water is held in place  and you can /none/ look down below the water is this slightly shimmering barrier and there is a  small airfilled chamber below  marisha okay yeah im pushing the water parting it giving us a little  sam can we fit through whatever hole there is  matt actually looking down inside it looks to be roughly 20 or so feet wide on almost any other  side and it looks to be that theres a small still pool that is there in the ground its a  small air pocket  laura yeah i go in after him  matt okay you /none/ all rush inside there you land past it and its about a 15 foot drop you all  land on your feet or stumble off to one side and catch yourself but youre now in this chamber  beneath  sam and the only thing keeping the water from rushing in here is keyleth  matt keyleth currently yeah  laura i like how everything is like keyleth can do this can you wall it off with create wall  sam well not while casting this spell  marisha all right push the water wall of stone boom  matt /none/ as soon as the water pushes away it begins to pull back and immediately you can hear the  rush of the ocean suddenly oppressively darting downward to fill the space where you are and then  with that slamming you watch as volcanic stone stretches out and slams shut youre now in a  pitchblack room except for the surface of his light and the glowing of keyleths hands  laura yay which are brighter now because were not in water  marisha oh  taliesin ow my ears popped  sam that was amazing  laura that was /none/ fucking sick  marisha you punched a volcano  travis i did didnt i grog versus the volcano  matt as you guys have this conversation youre talking and sounds are happening everythings  fine but exhales breath is hard  marisha oh oxygen  sam or poison  travis air pocket  matt all of the air in here is poisoned there is no oxygen in this room there is that pool of  water in the center maybe fourfoot wide and you can see its kind of bubbling a bit like whatever  the fume is thats filled /none/ the space is  liam how does heroes feast factor into this heroes feast doesnt that guard against poison  matt youre not poisoned youre not having toxic shock and dying right now but youre  suffocating  taliesin im going to put my face in the water and breathe  matt its not affecting you youre fine  laura oh because you dont breathe  sam youre already dead  marisha weirdo  travis yeah put your face in the water and breathe  taliesin im putting my face in the water and attempting to take a breath  /none/ matt the bubbling of air there is the same fume here  taliesin im just trying to use the water breath  matt oh the water breath itself oh with the water breathing the water you can breathe  laura oh great so any time we need a breath we just breathe okay  taliesin we might start getting a little loopy if we stay out here for too long  travis vex will you look for anything that looks like a core anvil and i stick my face in  laura i take a breath and i start looking /none/ for a door or any way out of this  taliesin im going to open the light fully  liam flametongue dagger is out so i can see the nonwater portion  matt okay  laura 18  matt 18 you go in and take a breath and you look down below especially with the light and the lamp  thats going around you can see where this is happening this little pool its another  small tube that descends farther and curves away out of sight  laura gasps is it wide enough for all of to fit through /none/  matt well from what you can see before it curves off it looks like it could probably fit  everybody  laura hey theres a tunnel down there  taliesin im going to tilt the light into it and take a look down  matt okay looking down it does its a curvature off it looks like at one point there was some  sort of an escape or at least that jet that you originally found earlier part of it got blocked  off and while the get of water continued the opening here kind of got covered /none/ with some sort of  liquid rock and it created this pocket you can swim down there who knows where it leads but it  does not appear to have any sort of a forceful jet  sam its a tube were in one of the cows stomachs  matt essentially  marisha control water lasts up to ten minutes so if we want to commit to this i can help jettison  us there  matt you have to cast it again though because you lost concentration  marisha why  travis because you made a wall of stone /none/  marisha we decided early on that wall of stone was instantaneous and permanent  matt permanent and concentration yeah okay ill let you go with that  marisha because it was in pathfinder  travis do we want to get rid of the water though because thats whats allowing us to  breathe  marisha the water just happens us breathing water is good for 24 hours  sam but if we get rid of the water then we wont have anything to breathe  marisha no im going to control water and im going to jettison us with /none/ the current  sam okay go for it  laura lets take it a little slow because we dont know what were coming up to though i  dont want to jump fullforce into  marisha yeah itll be like lazy river  laura something like that lead the way darling  matt well how the spell works is if you maintain concentration for the whole duration it becomes  permanent  marisha for the whole duration  matt for the whole duration which is ten minutes  marisha but i havent done that because ive already jettisoned this one /none/ water and then now  im trying to use the remaining  matt its fine dont worry about it  laura lets just go in the water i follow him although percy should technically be up front  because hes got light  matt okay so percival goes first followed by vax then vex  travis me in the middle  matt grog is trinket still swimming along with you  laura trinket is behind grog  matt all right and then thats scanlan and keyleth at the very end all right you guys dive  past under the water /none/ it curves and you can see theres a faint light source in the distance this  curves below it splinters downward and then curves up slightly and thats where the light  source is coming from  travis yeah of course air pocket  liam im going to go stealth  matt make a stealth check  travis do your navy seal shit  liam thats fine  travis come out of the water eyes open  liam 34  sam 34 jesus  matt all right you think youre pretty stealth  liam i think im pretty stealth  /none/ matt you think youre pretty stealth  liam all right  travis i dont like the way he said that  laura i know  matt go upward  liam yeah  matt okay as you get up you see a familiar orangeishred glow and as you see the surface of  water above you theres another looks like an air pocket you emerge you look about and it  looks like there is another tunnel here but theres a faint glow it looks like there are  small veins of cooling volcanic rock in this area the tunnel continues /none/ theres actually ground that  you can walk on that continues down and curves out of the way  travis the walls are cooling  liam i just turn to the group and im going to  laura can you see by the light of the magma  matt you can see fairly with your elven vision yeah and with your dagger so yeah you begin to  walk on the surface the surface is cooled and its very hot in here but not painfully so like  when you dove into the caldera itself you walk down about ten /none/ or 15 feet and you see its now  breaking off in various directions you can see small pockets where it closes off areas where it  looks like whatever air or gases were trapped up when parts of the volcano would expand and  pressurize upward it would trap these areas but you see areas where liquid rock are spilling into  and creating small pools and it continues to descend almost like a curved spiral around the  way  liam so theres a walkway but theres also lava  matt very faint trickles and cools slowly on /none/ the floor  liam ive only gone about 20 feet at this point is that right i am going to go around the bend  continuing quietly  matt you go around the bend and you can hear faintly the rushing of water muffled youre not  that far away you gather from spatial awareness as to where the heavy pressure of the water that  was forced upward you can faintly feel the vibration but as you curve away it gets dimmer  and dimmer as you spiral off further away from the center of this volcano and as /none/ it continues to  spiral downward this natural air pocket cavern it splits again into a small opening where its  settled faintly orange glowing with spots of black molten rock thats slowly cooling the path  curves around the way and it splits into two pockets of this cooling rock and then maybe about  a fivefoot leap to continue downward  marisha over lava  matt your favorite  marisha so bad at it  matt i know  liam im going to double back to the group  taliesin i think were already starting to make our /none/ way out  liam it goes a little further but i just didnt want to go too far on my own  laura what did you see  liam just goes further but i dont want to get separated completely so come up a bit and ill  go a little bit further  sam can we walk on it is it going to burn our little feetsies or do we need to fly  liam i dont think so  laura up and over lets yeah lets go up there  travis we follow vax  laura can we /none/ cast locate object on the anvil dont you have something that sends a direct path  to an object  marisha find the path but i think i have to have seen the object before it would also burn my last  6thlevel spell  liam i could do it but you have to be familiar with it being told about it doesnt count does  it  matt you dont have enough information to do that yeah you guys all emerge from the water to  gather up with vax  liam id like to lead them to where /none/ that jump is  matt okay as you all take a deep breath under the water and get to the surface you make a test  breath and the air in this pocket is still poisonous and not breathable so you guys are  going to have to take a deep breath under the water and hold your breath as you make your way  down that tunnel  laura oh fuck were there any other pockets of water along the way  liam shit get back in the water and im going to solo go where i wasnt intending /none/ to to see how  far it is to get to the next bit of water you said it was a jump over magma  matt yep  laura does your creepy undead brain remember how long it takes before we die if we  dont breathe do you remember that  liam i walk away from her and i go down the hall  matt all right its a decent jump to get over the lava its not a hard one necessarily but i  want you to make an athletics check anyway  liam ooh better use one /none/ of my lucks for that that was a one ooh six  matt six  liam six burn baby burn  matt total of six  liam yeah total of six already used luck its done  marisha why does this always happen to us  travis i dont know but i love it  matt you run and make a leap and youre pretty sure you made it but one foot sizzle right into  it  taliesin and marisha is it the same foot  matt its the same foot  taliesin and marisha yeah  matt thankfully /none/ your armor is set to resist  taliesin okay thats right that was early on wow  liam and yet vax aint sweating it not anymore  taliesin its nothing you havent had to regrow before  laura does your raven queen regenerate lost footsies  matt what would have been 56 damage is reduced to 28 fire damage to you you pull out real fast  sizzle groan it burns and burns and burns kick it off you keep walking around the curvature and  it takes about two minutes or so of brisk travel to get around the /none/ corner where you can see another  pool of warm water  laura two minutes  liam so i see water and i shove my face down in it and breathe it who knows with me and i go  back to where i burned my fucking foot and i go into the earring im not going to fucking jump  over that shit again tell them what i saw yeah two minutes so deep fucking breath yeah  laura ugh two minutes  liam and when you see me run towards me and follow me  laura yeah all /none/ right grog  travis what  laura are you good to run and jump over some lava  travis nope  matt so as you guys are aware you can hold your breath for a number of minutes equal to one plus  your constitution modifier  laura laughs oh no  travis awesome  laura okay but you were on foot if im on the broom then maybe it wouldnt take as long  potentially  matt you were making a careful path if you were to continue to dash full dash run it would be  close you /none/ can try it  laura okay im going to put trinket in the necklace  matt all right trinket in the necklace  laura do you want to get on the broom with me  taliesin ive got the boots so i was going to use my boots  laura all right anybody scanlan  sam yes please  travis its just a thought but i do have the bigass jug that can make a big thing of portable  water  laura gasps sick  marisha wait were waterboarding ourselves  travis well you can breathe in that shit /none/ right we wont be able to see  taliesin can we fit our head in that jug  matt yeah you can  taliesin youve just got to carry the jug and as long as we stick our head in the jug every time we  need to breathe youre a genius youre a genius i will say that seven more times well  space them out  sam we might run out of water though because were breathing it in  travis youre breathing it back out youre recycling it itll get a little less oxygenated  liam how /none/ long does a fish live in a fish tank  sam youre right were big fish  liam the biggest  travis do you want to do that  sam lets try it  travis salt water or fresh water or wine  laura and taliesin fresh water  travis i take out the alchemy jug and i say fresh water  matt it fills with fresh water to the surface  laura try breathing it  travis are we underwater right now  taliesin well take it out of the water  travis okay i stick my head in /none/ it can i breathe  matt yeah fine  travis it works it works im holding it above the water  laura oh smart  liam i hear you can do this with a nonmagical jug too  sam oh yeah we just could have carried water in a jug  travis dont downplay my special moment  sam we have chalices  laura we do have an extra chalice you know what im going to take the fancy chalice and as  needed  taliesin im going to use the breathing jug  matt this is the funnest workaround /none/ i love it  sam its a water bong  matt essentially you guys are gravitybonging your way through an underwater volcano if thats  not vox machina i dont know what is  taliesin its how i solve so many problems in my life its the solution to half our problems  liam were going to try to waterbong every combat scenario for the rest of the campaign  travis i was looking at it and i was like fresh water vinegar oh  matt all righty so  sam dont do drugs everyone  matt as you guys /none/ make your way around the way through the combination of that druid spell and  strangely grogs ingenuity you guys have bypassed a fairly serious situation you make it  down around the curvature of the tunnel to where that small lava jump is anybody who wants to make  that leap go ahead and make an athletics check please  laura i pop scanlan on the broom and we fly on over  taliesin i activated my boots and walk  marisha and i use my mantle which i constantly forget triples my jump distance  matt it does /none/ so go ahead and make an athletics check  travis 21  marisha thats not great acrobatics  matt athletics  marisha oh thats better thats better 15  matt 15 yeah you coast over its like a soft neo jump not quite that far but you coast and  land onto the side grog what did you get  travis 21  matt 21 you guys all make it across that little stretch of molten rock without an issue you  continue around the way vex and vax as you guys are making heavy footfalls and making some  /none/ distance you begin to feel this rumbling noise rumbling in the ground beneath you  liam oh shit  laura i think theres something burrowing or an earthquake  marisha earth elementals  laura potentially  marisha volcanic earth elementals  liam everybody hold still for a moment  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt okay  marisha dope  matt i would like all of you to make a stealth check right now  travis oh i think you barely got that in  matt barely  sam its plus ten  /none/ matt plus ten  sam 31  taliesin 34  marisha 34  liam 40  laura wow 25  travis im sorry guys  taliesin oh no plus ten  travis 16  sam oh okay thats above something  travis i have a feeling  sam what about trinket  laura trinkets in the necklace  matt the rumbling stops as you all quietly stand still you begin to get bold to take a few more  very faint steps on the ground the rumbling continues and gets louder and louder  laura whispers i get my bow /none/ ready  matt all right im going to go to break  travis oh you fucking didnt  matt im hungry all right yeah so well pick up from that rumbling here at the end of the  break well see you guys back here in a moment we have quite the giveaway today we have a  spalted tamarind complete dice tower system three pieces from our friends at wyrmwood this is  actually this is percivals wood type its nice with a

congratulations johnny2x40 danoba will contact you shortly to get  your information and well get that shipped out to you asap signed by the cast congratulations  liam the fuck was that  marisha i loved it so much  taliesin thats amazing  matt all right so as the rumbling continues to grow and swell you all hold yourselves in place  rumbling crashing you hear the crumbling and crashing of stone and rock as from the side of  the hallway right next to where grog is standing maybe about a foot /none/ and a half in front of him you  watch some large pointed object pierce through the wall maybe about nine feet tall or so go  explosion out sending dust and rock spilling out and theres a faint orange glow from some  smooth armored head to some large creature with a toothy mouth that opens up and chomping as it  bites down you see rows and rows of teeth that are glowing orange as bits of molten rock are  spilling out the sides of the mouth  marisha its like 2006s the core  matt yeah /none/ i hope its better than that you recognize the shape of the front especially you  percival as you spent some time with a creature of a similar shape  laura oh is it a worm a purple worm  matt no because it has two big muscular trunklike arms as it crash crash out in front  but it has no eyes it has the solid armored front and heated edges where the plates meet it  seems to be some sort of elementalinfused or variant of the bulette that you encountered  before and as it breaks through /none/ and stops mere inches from grog turn that thing off  liam it talks its a sentient bulette  sam happy birthday  matt snarls across the way you hear a low rumble again snarls it stomps the ground and  you watch from one of the other walls explosion jutting from it a smaller version  and a second emerges explosion two children they both emerge going snarls as youre all  standing there holding perfectly still  sam they cant see us well stand still and well be fine right  marisha jurassic park rules  matt sniffs /none/  laura oh no  liam we could attack them  laura theres three of them  matt one of them turns around and starts walking slowly towards the direction that grog is  the large mother and turns grog and you have to lean back as the nose sweeps past and  is facing right in your direction you can see these large holes in the front of its armored  snout go sniffing the mouth slightly cracks open and curls back into what you could almost  imagine to be a grin  travis can i quietly go /none/ into a rage  laughter  taliesin you are not my parents  matt well as none of you have done anything at this point in time i need you all to roll  initiative  liam see thats what it was thats what it was  travis i heard you saying it too  laura you should have just done it  marisha do what  liam dont worry about it  laura no  taliesin goddamnit no  liam every time every time i do it  marisha oh your sneak attack  liam yes fuckers  matt /none/ so grog who was stopped here was the last to leap keyleth made it all the way over here  laura trinkets in the necklace we were on the broom  matt broom over here  marisha might still be able to do it  matt vax where were you you were stealthed  liam i was near the lead  matt so you would be over here stealthing behind this rock  sam what a great board  laura this is really cool oh god its huge grog little baby bulette  travis its huge  laura do we /none/ remember what its weaknesses were  marisha i know it takes half damage i think to nonmagical physical attacks hes got  heavily armored skin other than that i dont know  sam ooh did a new light just pop on and another light for a red lava effect in my eyes  matt into your eyes sam thats why i do this all right so initiative order 25 to 20  laura oh 20  matt 20 to 15  liam 17  travis 19  sam 18  laura does it realize that anybody but grog is there /none/  matt you dont know  laura we could have potentially  matt all right and youre 17 you said  liam 17  matt all right  sam here we go this is going to be fun  matt all right 15 to ten  marisha 13  taliesin 12 my lowest possible initiative  marisha did you roll a one  taliesin i rolled a one  matt all righty so top of the round as all of them seem to have shifted in the direction of  grog who is now quietly raging vex youre up first /none/ what do you want to do  laura oh god im going to try to hit it with a lightning arrow  matt which one  laura what do you mean  travis what animal  liam theres the mama and two babies  laura im going to try to hit the one thats breathing on grog  matt all righty so go ahead and make your attacks  travis yeah provoke the thing with its teeth closest to me im just fucking with you  laura but it knows youre there maybe it doesnt know im there plus i /none/ get a sneak attack on it  because youre right next to it  matt its true  laura and im going to hunters mark it  matt look at that  laura laughs i say  matt she says to you  laura 25  matt 25 hits  laura lovely so if that was a 3rdlevel lightning arrow then that means i get 3d8  lightning damage in addition to my regular damage or is it just 3d8 lightning damage wait roll the  attack as normal the target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit oh and /none/ every creature within ten  feet makes a dexterity saving throw okay if i cast it at 4thlevel so no its just 3rdlevel  matt so its 4d8 lightning damage so you made the attack roll it hit so it takes that  laura wow really nine plus  matt grog make a dexterity saving throw please  travis thank you i have advantage on those but i wont need it because that was a 19  laura 15 it doesnt actually do my regular arrow attack damage its just wow my spells are  useless compared to my regular /none/ attacks  travis 21  laura 15 damage  matt all right so 15 damage and then 2d8 to grog roll 2d8 and you take half that because you  made your save  travis 19 its right on the paper negative two sorry  laura you still made your save  matt yeah whats the damage  laura five  matt five damage to you grog  travis thank you  matt five total or thats halved  laura thats five total  matt all right you take two points of lightning damage not too bad  laura im /none/ going to try to hit it again then  matt lightning arrow well no interesting point of order lightning arrow is a bonus  action  laura oh and i did hunters mark  matt so no hunters mark  laura oh so i did hunters mark no oh i am never going to do spell attacks ever again theyre  worthless for me  matt so no hunters mark but you hit it with the lightning arrow next round you can worry about  that  laura okay  matt thats your first attack you have your second attack /none/  laura okay then im going to attack it with a regularass arrow that does more damage  probably natural 20 than a fucking lightning arrow  matt you did not do your sneak attack damage last round so if you wanted to do sneak attack damage  on this you can  laura okay lovely  matt which means you also double the

direction you going to do anything else on your turn  laura can i get on my broom  matt yeah you get on your broom  laura i get on my broom  matt thats all you do all righty grog youre up  travis oh i

disappears inside the slight gap and you see this spurt  of super hot thick viscous blood spill out and hit /none/ the side of the rock and then cool and  darken as it does across the side of the cavern wall  liam and then for movement watch this shit right here folks counting 40 because im hasted 45  50 55  matt there you go  sam and laura wow  liam i did it my fucking self  matt all right

wings  wing flap keeping you aloft and the babys /none/ going to snapping and lash out towards you that  is 18  sam does not hit  matt does not hit as it snaps out towards you its saliva seeming to spray superheated liquid  saliva spray across does not attack you at all  laughter  taliesin well that got gifed  liam dr manhattan in the house  matt the other baby watches you go running past its

damage  laura youve got another one here  marisha oh 52 plus another seven so 59  matt 59 damage against all three of them so as you stand in the middle and watch one of them leap  past and pounce onto /none/ your lover as hes pushed out of the way you see grog now facing off with this  giant gnashing mouth that is spilling forth superhot liquid the lava glowing in the  distance youre having flashbacks to the last time you dealt with lava you concentrate for a  second and release the blast of energy as it arcs off explosions slamming into each of them you  see them shake and quiver their muscles tensing as they shriek in the middle of the cavern  shrieks they stagger backward hurt but seemingly still holding on all right percy /none/ your  turn  taliesin im going to activate silence so thats up charge diplomacy im going to give it a  little rev with my bonus action and im going to oh wow can i actually reach i cant quite  reach but i can get close im going to head against that wall and start climbing up that  wall  laura right here  taliesin yeah up there just put me up there yeah there we go  matt okay is that all youre going to do with your turn  taliesin thats my action my bonus /none/ action and my movement  matt all right thats your turn all right now its the mama bulettes turn mama bulette has  been facing grog this whole time after taking the dagger and watching you run past seeming ready to  leap but with you still right in front of it shell attack you that is a natural 18 this is  important so thats a total of 31 to hit  travis let me check yeah  matt so thats 45 points of piercing damage halved well say 22 plus 13 points of fire  damage and you /none/ are swallowed on an attack roll of an 18 to 20 it swallows the target and  literally i rolled a natural 18  taliesin what happens if you  travis its always me laughing its always me  matt apparently man  taliesin what happens if you titanstone never mind im going to find out  travis weve done this before im wellversed  matt you are blinded and restrained currently  travis blinded and restrained  matt it now begins to thudding go right up into melee range with keyleth who blasted it with the  chain lightning /none/ before that brings us to the top of the round vex youre up  laura okay im going to hunters mark it and then im going to attack it with an arrow  matt go for it  laura old woman voice bramble shot  matt howd that go again  laura old woman voice bramble shot normal voice 25 oh can i do sharpshooter and do minus  five to hit plus ten to attack  matt generally you have to decide that before you roll your attack you cant just add it on  like oh i rolled /none/ well ill say no not for that first attack you can for your second  laura this one is a bramble shot and its a 25 to hit  matt that does hit  laura okay cool five plus eight is 13 14 15 15 plus sneak attack and lightning damage 15 19  23 25 and then 4d8 piercing damage 32  matt all right 32 points  laura and then he has to make a strength saving throw  matt that is a 20  laura then he succeeds  matt as the arrow slams into the side /none/ the brambles reach around and you watch as these  thorny vines that wrap around the body begin to blacken and burst into flame by the proximity the  brambles begin to burn to cinders and then break off the body as it storms forward  laura i attack him again this time im going to try as a sharpshooter  matt do it  laura okay  matt youre up next grog  laura natural 20  matt holy shit thatll hit  laura and its a bramble shot do i have to say that before too motherfucker  /none/ matt well bramble shot gets to see if it hits or not its not lost if you missed if you hit you  can say bramble shot  laura so yeah  matt same way that divine smite can be done  laura okay cool all right right im going to roll all my dice and then double that then add  my extra things how about that  matt do that thats usually how youre supposed to do it  laura all right matt okay so 11 14 20 23 25 50 thats easy 58 60  matt 60 /none/ points of damage with one shot and secondary saving throw  laura oh plus ten because it was sharpshooter 70  matt 70 points of damage with a single arrow you didnt add your sneak attack damage a second time  did you okay good that is nasty it rolled a natural 16 plus six for its strength saving throw  so its not affected by the bramble however it is looking rough the second arrow hits the side  and you watch as it streaks pieces of the armor fall off to the side you can see the striations /dung/ of  its muscle and where the muscle tissue is its dark but at the seams its glowing orange  laura i didnt add the hunters mark damage well only extra two damage for that  matt there you go extra two damage but now its bleeding everywhere wherever its walking you  can see it thrashing about its spilling off this heated liquid thats pouring out of its wounds  does that end your turn  laura no im going to move on my broom so he doesnt know im there im going to fly to here  matt /none/ okay that ends your turn grog youre up first things first at the start of your turn  because you are swallowed by the mom you suffer 42 points of fire damage oh it has to make a  constitution saving throw to see if it spits him up first actually because you did more than 40  points of damage that is a 22 yeah its fine wait no its 25 dc no it does not you do not  take the damage because she did enough damage with that crit hit arrow that it vomits you up you /none/ are  prone  laura happy birthday  travis thank you  matt that would have been a good 42 points of damage  marisha grog gets vomited up in front of me  matt yep sizzling theres steam  travis every fucking time hi  marisha you smell like shit  matt grog its your turn  travis id like to stand up  matt all right  sam jump into its throat  taliesin jump back in  travis i would like to smash my titanstone knuckles together and cast enlarge on myself  gotta get

laura but we havent seen it havent seen it up close oh grog is scary as fuck im sorry  youre scary okay  travis can i do reckless great weapon master  matt yes you may  taliesin thats something travis would say  laura put me down  taliesin its something travis would say  travis 26  matt /none/ yeah that hits  travis nice 37 on the first  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  travis singing happy happy war cry  taliesin happy birthday  matt after it finishes vomiting you up and you get off the ground still feeling the sizzling of  its salivary liquid on your body you sing this song to yourself as it rights itself its mouth  opens once more you bring the axe down right above its head you crack the center of its armored  plate the top of its head caves in and /none/ you watch as the eyes go dull and the body collapses and falls  to the ground unmoving its body is still there though because its very big it only loses about  two feet of height as it collapses and its still blocking a large portion of that hallway right  now thats your first hit you still have half of your movement still because you used half of  it to get up from prone  travis should i try and push him out of the way  laura just vault over it  travis yep im going /none/ to leaping noise over the side hardcore parkour onehanded  sam duke boys sliding over the hood of the car  matt using your boots or just making an athletics check as part of your movement  travis yeah lets use the boots of feral leaping  matt go ahead and make your athletics check  travis thats going to be a 26 27 towards you towards his left yep and ill move up  matt you have 25 more feet  travis i do dont i  matt you can use your piece look at that  travis can /none/ i get around here on the ground  matt yeah you could you can make an acrobatics check to see if you can avoid the lava as you do  that  travis yeah i want to  matt all right make an acrobatics not athletics  travis acrobatics 16  matt 16 you just barely make it around that corner curling around yeah you dont go  footfirst in the lava like somebody else did earlier  marisha im picturing grog being like intense grunting careful inching intense grunting  matt thats about where you can get to  /none/ travis im right there yeah  matt thats the end of your turn grog scanlan youre up  sam as my holy self imbued with the holy power of whatever i am i float up a bit draw my  greatsword that i always use to attack because im awesome and bring it down real hard on the head of  the thing  matt go ahead and roll for an attack  laura are you naked with a sword hanging from your hip  liam hes hitting it with his dick  sam no im naked with a sword /none/ ive got a belt im naked with a belt  marisha hes mr november  sam that is 21  matt 21 hits the babies dont have quite as hard armor as you bring the greatsword down you  strike with a large swipe of bright divine radiant energy as it slams into the top of its  head it explodes with radiant power  sam do i roll or do i use these stats  matt you roll damage the stats are for me 4d6 plus seven slashing  sam seven 12 18 plus seven is 25 plus i /dung/ need 5d8  marisha oh yeah use mine they just did very good  matt yeah dude planetar form isnt messing around  laura he didnt shake them you just put them on down that was the shadiest roll ever if  you did that in vegas theyd be like no  travis the pit boss over here disapproves  sam plus 14 so thats 39 right  matt 39 yes  sam on my first attack  matt so first off i forgot earlier grog you did take another seven points of fire damage from  being in the /none/ proximity of the corpse which is still emanating heat by the way  travis halved because i have resistance from the enlargement now  matt correct well at the top of your turn you got that because you did not enlarge inside and  you also as your planetar form did take ten points of fire damage in your proximity to that  one there as well so mark that however you with that first strike slam down and cleave the  head in half you watch as the babys head gravelly shriek it had taken 49 damage before  /none/ from her chain lightning so with that second hit whack it gurgles and falls to the ground no  longer moving there is only one currently living child on the battlefield  sam all right well then ill say a silent prayer for the fallen and then fly backwards super  fast to the other one whoosh and attack again  laura maybe you can make it a pet  sam oh 18  matt 18 still hits  sam hey all right look at all these crazy things 12 plus thats not very good 12 plus  all those /none/  matt that was 12 plus seven  sam thats right 19  matt so 19 damage  sam counting 19 whatever i just said is that 19 plus 19  matt 19 plus 19  sam 34  matt 38 damage that kills it yeah so you hack one down dart across the way with your blade  screaming in the air it actually cuts through the rock as it sparks across the ceiling with what  little space you have your wings open slam down on the second child and watch as its armored body  cracks open /none/ the radiant blast expands and bursts when the blade is actually dug a few inches into  its form causing you to destroy it from the inside of its armored shell you watch as its body  inflates for a second then falls limp as smoke begins to pour from its wounds so with that you  guys have wiped out the current danger on the battlefield  sam i feel like theres more coming  laura no that was it  travis were just traumatized  laura the core anvil is going to float up from the magma  /none/ marisha its so hot  taliesin thats a complicated tray  laughter  travis as he herniates a disc  matt yeah i pulled my leg earlier this week so moving up and down sucks so as you sit there in  the silence there for a moment just hearing the occasional plopping with the nearby lava that  fills the nearby hallway you dont feel any further rumbling theres just the heat emanating  from the corpses of these three magma bullettes what do you do  travis can i look around for anything that resembles an anvil or /none/ a shelf or something that  one might wackadoodle on  matt make an investigation check  travis nice watch me knock this out of the park  matt id say more of a perception check for this this is less of searching for details  travis thats better still shitty 11  matt the pathway still continues to descend and curve around but thats it  travis the pathway still continues to descend around  laura wow very observant of you grog  marisha descended around  travis what  marisha copy that  laura can we see now /none/ because of all the glow coming from does magma glow  matt most of you aside from percival can see decently in low light anyway or have  darkvision  taliesin its only been about 25 seconds but we do eventually have to breathe  laura oh ill use my chalice  marisha oh yeah pass the jug  sam what about me  matt you as a planetar lets see here  sam i think im dying  laura what why  sam i dont know i think i probably need air  matt well you have a pretty /none/ high con bonus you could hold your breath for seven minutes  sam ill do that see how i fare  laura do you still have heroes feast  sam no  marisha no you do  sam i dont think i do im a new body  marisha no true polymorph you absorb your gear and you dont benefit from it but it doesnt say  anything about you not benefiting from  matt previous spells and bonuses thats an interesting point  taliesin the soul is imbued with heroes feast not the body  marisha correct  matt /none/ okay  sam interesting  taliesin see its all there  laughter  liam but were along the path to the water that i saw  marisha the gear melds into the new form the creature cannot activate use wield or otherwise  benefit from any of its equipment but it doesnt say anything else other than equipment  sam thank you lindsay lohan  marisha youre very welcome  matt ill allow it  sam i still cant breathe  matt you still have the same effect earlier that she put on you so you still have the water /none/  breathing  sam oh so i can breathe some water all right cool  matt youre flying in here with the small space you have being a large creature the fact that  you even flew across you were only a few inches off the ground as you darted over its only about  ten to 12 feet and youre maybe nine feet tall  laura youre 12 feet tall so youre hitting the ceiling  taliesin im going to start peering around the corner with the flashlight  liam were under two minutes away from the water i /none/ previously made it up to and didnt go into  correct  matt correct youre maybe 40 seconds away from it  taliesin im going to head that way  matt you guys dart around the corner and follow the next pool you have your means of passing  water around keeping yourselves viable the path continues to curve in a haphazard spiral it  curves around and you watch as it passes evens out and then goes into a fairly steep decline  a 45degree decline  laura should i try flying down there with the broom  liam /none/ were 30 seconds away from the water ive  already gone this way and come back to you guys unless  something has jumped in the hole while i was gone in that time ive already covered this ground  matt this is further than you covered theres the pool of water you saw and if you continue  around that way you can see it curve as you glance around and it descends in a steady  decline  taliesin the pool of water is just a pool of water  matt its a small little pit  laura /none/ im going to recast pass without a trace on all of us ps  taliesin i can follow you down there too because ive got my boots on  marisha do the two twins want to scout  matt the pool of water by the way as you glance down and look past the surface it does have a  cylindrical tube that is feeding the liquid into it but its much smaller it gets to that big of  a pinching point before it vanishes out of sight  liam of your hands  matt of the pool continuing /none/ down the path of the tunnel as it curves around and goes into the  decline it continues and maintains its width of about 15 to 20 feet on either side you glance  down the decline and theres a portion of the ground that opens up and glowing molten rock  slowly drips and dribbles down for about 40 or 50 feet  sam im going to cast detect evil and then wordlessly speak to you all  laura oh in our brains i like it  sam i say brothers and sisters allow me to guide us by /none/ the spirits of my religious faith down  into the depths of this hell place  liam while hes talking i turn to my sister and go  laura are you still you scanlan just in another body  sam yes my child inside  travis boners and wangs  laura its weird that youre nine feet tall but your penis is still a cube  sam thats by choice  laughter  sam so you can recognize me if i die in a fight and you have to go to a lab and identify the body  youll be /none/ like fake crying oh its him  liam and they shall know him by his cube  laura sorry yes lead the way  matt you glide down your own way the air is extremely warm as it passes by you holding your  breath at this point because you are not near any source of water it looks like and youre not  carrying one with you you glide down rapid speed past the lava which eventually comes and cools in  a clump a small mound where it seems a recent hole punched out of and began to /none/ dribble down  its been cooling and causing this extra layer on the tunnel everything here seems to be in this weird  state of flux you continue past it and it drops into a tunnel below maybe about 20 or 30 feet  wide descends downward  sam straight down  matt straight down  sam ill go down a bit  matt you descend about 30 or 40 feet this cylinderlike tunnel comes to a halt it stops  sam am i detecting any evil  matt you are not detecting any evil no do you have darkvision /none/ in this form  sam i dont know where does it say  matt it says truesight you dont have darkvision you have everything vision  taliesin predator vision  sam i can also speak every language  matt given that case as soon as you land you look up and you can see across the rock here  there is one portion of the wall that is smoother than the rest in a concave perfect square across  the opposite side you can see faint runes or glyphs that are pressed into the stone like part  of it /none/ has been untouched for quite some time  sam is there writing or is it just symbols  matt because you can read any language right  sam it says languages all  matt yeah okay  taliesin this is the most irritated ive ever seen matt  liam this is because of the planetar not ioun planetar this is how you must stay always  sam i agree  matt glancing at the glyphs here there are roots of magical arcane glyphs here but whatever  enchantment there was here is very faint its more about the message or /dung/ image that is set here  it is an exit seal it is a final word of those that utilized the space within it translates to  here the crafters halls lay dark the means of making the world ender gone allhammer protect us all  sam allhammer wow i dont know  matt the allhammer make a religion check  laura the allhammer was  travis youre not there  sam looking religion i dont know 11 plus i dont know  matt recalling that information you have this information in your mind ill say as long as you /dung/  didnt roll a one  liam you dont remember it but you remember it  matt the allhammer is one of the prime gods of family craft and construction of fine important  things it is the patron saint of all craftsmen blacksmiths forgemasters artisans and from the  information you received from ioun the creator of and last user of the core anvil  marisha so is it the allhammer lies beyond is dark  matt it was an exit phrase placed on this door by the last person who was in this  marisha here the crafters /dung/ hall remains dark the allhammer  laura watch over us  marisha watch over us something about watching over us yeah validate free parking  taliesin objects in hammer are closer than they appear  sam ill fly back and report to the rest in my pristine body my pristine hairless body and  that is what i saw  laura that was all in our heads  sam yes  travis i think thats what were looking for right  laura yeah lets go  liam it was a flight down yeah  sam hold on one second blowing /none/ water bubbles  laughter  sam im back to being pristine  matt just so everyone here understands imagine between most conversations theres somebody doing  that into a small jar of water  sam blowing water bubbles and its all cloudy now from everybody  laura how often can you reup that jar oh god its nasty water  liam youre motorboating a gravy bowl  sam its like a horse trough theres hair  matt it is getting a little thick  laughter  matt oh god  laura should we head down there did it seem like /none/ you could pass through that door  sam oh i didnt try the door  laura you didnt try to get through it  sam sorry  laura its all right we can find a way its just a door  sam its just a door well be fine  travis yeah were great entering doors great history with doors lets go  matt whos doing what to get down there  taliesin im walking down there  matt you footsteps on the side  laura i am flying down with the broom does anybody else need to ride do /none/ you need to bamf  your wings out or do you want to get on the broom  liam im going to save those ill get on the broom youre offering me a ride on the broom  travis ive got the carpet  marisha ill take the carpet or whatever  matt grog and keyleth on the carpet you two on the broom you flying were good the rest of you  guys descend down at a 45degree grade and make it past where the lava stopped and cooled and  collected and thickened up eventually you find the /none/ area where it drops off into darkness below in  this cylindrical tunnel you make it down the 30 or so feet to where it stops it takes you a  moment based on where scanlan points you towards but you can make out the runes he was mentioning  percy youre the only one who can read them  taliesin more of that all right  marisha what what does it say  taliesin its a shops closed i suppose  laura can we reopen it  matt no indicator of that it was essentially door click key is /none/ locked up forever bye bless  this seal  laura bust through this shit or undo it do we have a way to cancel the seal out  marisha so its quite literally a family business were closed retired bars in front of it  matt you get that sense the forge was made by and for the use of the allhammer and the  allhammer is locked somewhere on his own plane across the other side of the divine gate and has  been for 800 years  liam weve got a godmade doorway in front of us somethingmade /none/ door right natural rock around it  or is everything carved  matt natural volcanic rock its that same crumbly porous black stone  taliesin im going to touch the doors  matt it feels like the rest of the surrounding stone  taliesin theres no obvious mechanism for opening it  matt make an investigation check  laura can i pray to pelor  taliesin thats awful no six  matt no current sign of anything  taliesin anytime i look for anything worthwhile i stare at rock going huh found a rock  laura im going to pray /none/ to pelor i dont know if it makes a difference  matt what are you going to say  laura im going to say well we are here at a doorway i dont know if you speak to the  allhammer if you know anything about this but if you have any way to help us get through this now  would be the time trying to do good work here for you and all of mankind  travis what about your bean  laura oh yeah well im going to take the bean out and say all that shit /none/ again with the bean in  between my hands im going to whisper it to the bean because its part of him  marisha can you hear the ocean  matt ocean bean putting the words and thoughts out there prayer is still a foreign thing to you  that youre still learning to do  laura thats why it was so good  matt theres no words that respond but you do get a warm sense pushing you forward you get the  idea from whatever guidance pelor is sending your direction that you can translate from your only /none/  recently somewhatfaithful heart that youre on the right path thats as much as you can muster  from the conversation  laura thanks  travis i dont want to jump the gun but i did punch a volcano today this door probably not too  big a tuna for me to filet you know what i mean unless the runes say if you punch melt you will  sam it didnt say anything like that  travis it didnt  marisha it seems like its just closed  laura are they glowing runes are they magical runes do they /none/ seem like theyre magic  matt this is an interesting point i should have recalled grog are you still in your large form or not  travis yeah  matt how did you use the magic carpet to get across that carpet will not carry you in your  large form  travis oh good point  laura youre little or you could have  taliesin just slid down  laura oh yeah could you have stretched to either side and he does a ninja warrior shit down the  tube  travis well we dont know how wide how /none/ wide  laura well thats what i mean  matt the passageway heading downward would probably be somewhere in the neighborhood of  between 15 to 20 feet  laura what about a wonder woman situation where you impacts because you got the siege gauntlets  on and you make handholds  liam how long a drop was it  matt well the drop wasnt the issue it was the 40 feet of lava that was curling down  travis you could fly down and put me in the necklace if you want  laura yeah sure thats what i /none/ did popped trinket out flew back up grabbed grog came back  down  matt from a logistical standpoint i recalled that  travis good call  matt okay so what are you guys going to do  taliesin are the runes glowing are the runes not glowing  matt no the runes arent glowing you get the sense scanlan that it was less that they were  glowing more that your truesight revealed the presence  sam to me everything is glowing a little bit  matt you are a little neo in the matrix in this new physical /none/ form  taliesin tommy wiseau is what im getting from this im going to take the sun stone out of its  little container and really light up the room and just illuminate the whole room now  laura is there a door knob or anything that looks like a seal  matt make an investigation check  taliesin thank you somebody  laura 18  liam 22  matt 22 glancing about with the help of his light as well you look and you can see most of  the rock is jagged and broken in places and as /none/ you feel the edges some parts flake off  relatively easy and when you get to the section of where that rectangular piece of the wall is  that the glyphs are put across it looks like its a little smoothed over like someone smoothed it  down to make this intentional seal but theres no sign of any sort of keyhole or handle or  anything  laura maybe you could push it  travis lets try being polite first i will knock on the door  matt its heavy stone  travis all right fuck this i try /none/ and push the door either in and to either side  matt make a strength check  liam laura and marisha go strongjaw go  travis 17  sam youre inspired  travis oh yeah ill use that shit  matt its a d12  travis oh it is oh shit awesome 26  matt 26 you jam your hands into the wall and push as you push and shove your fingers are  grinding and breaking the actual stone until they feel something metal it goes from crumbling stone  to a metallic surface and as you pull your /dung/ hands back a little bit you pull away these giant  chunks of volcanic stone the actual runes and glyphs breaking around your grasp and you can  look inside and see hammered dark metal on the other side you then put your hand in and shove as  hard as you can and with a very faint grinding you feel it give about an inch then another inch  and then eventually it gives out suddenly and you watch as suddenly the entire square structure  falls inward with a slamming echo sound that echoes again and again down /none/ a stairway that  disappears from view about 20 feet ahead of you  laura check for traps  travis you got it natural 20  laughter  travis thats not my thing  matt natural 20 doesnt mean you succeed necessarily  liam 18 for me  matt all right both of you glance throughout the initial  liam grog what do your elven eyes see  matt  steps into the hallway which is now littered with broken rock  for the first ten feet or so with a platform where the large rectangular  metal structure fell /tavern/ over no signs of any traps no signs of any tweaking with the floor or walls  for any triggers you do notice that the metal surfaces here are a texture of rough hammered  metal you can see the series of small indentations like all these have been hammered  into place and it looks like the seams where these large metallic wall slabs would be have a  thin little placed bar over those as well youve gone from central volcano natural emerging and  expanding rock and lava to a place of very intense intended construct  /dung/ travis i feel like this is it  laura would my greedy eyes know what kind of metal it is  matt make an intelligence check  sam its all pewter pewter everywhere  laura intelligence investigation  matt well this would be just an intelligence check just a straight modifier  laura laughs oh ten  matt ten sighs youre not entirely certain of the metal it is a dark dull slate gray a  little darker than that even and elements of the edges appear to be almost red almost like a rust  or ruddy color but /none/ you dont recognize what type of metal it is necessarily  liam im stealthing im stealthing down the steps  laura i did cast pass without a trace on all of us again a while ago i said it i even marked it  off after the fight  matt okay you rolled a natural 20  liam yep using a luck but yeah  matt using luck youve used three lucks today  liam three of my four according to your campaign guide  matt the campaign guide was something that was for other people to use  laughter /none/  matt as sort of an inside joke for the previous more than three lucks  liam well that was my third not my fourth  matt right im saying for the purposes of the guide being released and you embracing your  fatetouched nature and the extremely dutiful adherence to the law of your raven queen sure  ill give you a fatetouched additional fourth luck  marisha hes throwing you a bone  sam you know why because he knows liam bought the book  liam i did buy the book i bought the book in the first /none/ hour  sam i bought the book too what do i get  matt you get an awesome angel dick  laughter  laura your oneinch cube suddenly grows  liam to two inches  matt angel wang by the way is a good band name  travis singing angel wang  matt all right  sam im going to fly over to vex and wordlessly say to her be honest do you think im more  handsome like this or as normal scanlan  laura im going to think in my head scanlans the best  sam be aware /none/ that as a divine being i can sense any lie  laughter  laura scanlan darling youre fucking hot right now all right but i love you like you were  youre always my favorite when youre just yourself  sam all right thank you i turn my little naked butt to her and fly away  laughter  matt all right so this hallway that you guys have pushed through now its about 20 feet wide  30 feet tall and this long ceiling gradually curves to an apex point like two adjoining sides  of a roof and /none/ it continues to progress forward and then descends with the staircase  travis are the walls hot to the touch since theyre metal  matt you put your hand out and feel it and yes they are not like sizzle but your hand can  rest for a few seconds before you have to remove it theyre very hot  travis we progress forward into the room down the stairs wherever the stairs lead  matt all right so you leading  liam yeah im 60 feet ahead with my 47 stealth right now  matt right okay so as /none/ you begin first thing you notice the steps theyre long steps they  are about three feet wide each step  liam godsized  matt so youre having to like step step step leap down a few feet continue again leap down a  few feet and each of you are doing this who here does not have magic boots  marisha me  laura i mean just part of my armor if thats not boots then its probably just the front  guards huh  sam i dont  matt youre flying youre fine  laura but ive got /none/ my broom that i just said i was on  matt correct so youre fine you as youre walking the ground is very hot and you can  continue to move your feet in a way where its not too bad but you get the sense if you were wearing  normal boots and not the usual asharimade leather setup that you work on they would  probably be melting across the metal floor here  laura you want to hop up on this broom  marisha oh im just big strides big strides  laura all right it looks /none/ awkward but stay there if youd rather  marisha i try to look more normal while still taking big strides  travis its not working  marisha no  matt all right so the air itself now smells of very caustic fumes mixed with the smell of burning  coal but there is oxygen now in this chamber you can breathe theres enough air to actually get a  lungful here and there though it is still thin and there is still the toxic fume here that had  you not had the heroes feast youd be having a rough /none/ time but youre not having to constantly  dip into the jug anymore  travis did one of yall growl just now that was you  taliesin that was me  travis or did it come out of the speaker  liam you dont know  travis that shit scared me  laughter  travis that shit was too loud from a weird direction i got all haunted house for a second i  was like gasps  matt i cannot wait to get to halloween horror nights with you again  liam travis willinghams fatal flaw  travis im /none/ quick as hell laughs  matt you are quick thats why we leave you ten feet ahead of us  taliesin you are the best jump scare  marisha one of these days youre going to break someones nose  travis i know ah im so sorry  laughter  matt its going to be glorious anyway as you descend the staircase you ahead make a  perception check  liam all right im going to use your pelor die hey thats good perception you say 27  matt 27 okay you continue down for about two minutes or so /none/ and even glancing ahead to the edge  of your visual range here in the darkness because there is no light source below at this point  the stairs are continuing and continuing and continuing and you have no idea how long itll go  for but you begin to sense as youre walking and you hear this faint rhythmic bassy rumble of a  low nearly inaudible drumlike beat deeper than any sound youve heard quaking the ground ever so  faintly slow rumbling pulses and you can very faintly feel it you get down and move your  /none/ fingers to the ground and for the moments before the heat gets there the next time you hear it  you can feel a very faint vibration only because you are very perceptive at the moment  liam is it exactly rhythmic precisely  matt id say with your high perception check you can tell that yes it is precisely rhythmic  liam i think theres some sort of godsized machinery ahead of us i think were getting  close  laura did you lose your earring because youre an angel now  travis no he keeps all his stuff /none/  sam i dont have the earring but i can talk to you telepathically in any language how about  italian darling  laughter  laura stop being creepy scanlan  sam i sense my hour is coming to an end soon  matt you guys are about 20 minutes out both you and grog before you lose your forms  liam do you know binary one zero zero one zero one one zero one zero one  marisha speak in morse code  matt another ten 15 minutes of descending these stairs that seem to go on and on /none/ and on and you  guys are starting to hear this low rumbling but it is getting steadily louder the further down you  climb vax you begin to see along the metallic walls occasionally shapes in the metal and you  glance over vax and look and you can see carved from the metal humanoid armored warriors  standing about ten or so feet tall larger than normal their poses vary some of them are on the  side some of them are attacking some of them are defending and about every 25 or 30 feet or so  /none/ there will be one on one side or the other  liam are they standing free or are they carved from the wall  matt no theyre from the wall  laura theyre drawings  matt theyre reliefs theyre metallic reliefs in the wall  travis not some metal medusa that turned them into metal  matt made of the same metal it looks like as the walls around them  taliesin im going to quickly inspect one  matt make an investigation check  taliesin im rolling terribly nine  matt nine  laura i want to look at /none/ them too i want to fly up on my broom i was going to say it and then he  said it  travis please dont be golems that will come out and fight us  laura investigation 22  matt 22 glancing around the seams these appear to be just reliefs in the wall there is no deeper  seam their proportions are flattened they are designs in the wall  taliesin does the style indicate anything  matt the craftsmanship is extraordinary the detail because you rolled so high you can tell  that these are just reliefs /none/ in the wall but up until that point it looks like the detail in the  nooks and crannies are so microscopic you can see texture on the skin almost like pores carved in  its immaculate its artistic the level of detail put into these  marisha grog do you trust this  travis to what are you pointing  marisha the reliefs the people in the wall okay it was a hypothetical question  travis right do i trust the art  marisha just to be safe i cast freedom of movement on grog just in case  /none/ travis ooh i start popping and locking  marisha so loose so free so much movement  matt so that lasts for an hour great  laura im going to be stealthy i dont want to be noisy  matt okay roll stealth please  laura 32  matt okay so what is the marching order here please  travis i dont actually mind taking the lead on this one  matt okay  sam do we have five minutes left or less  matt youre pushing about ten minutes or so at this point  travis i think five /none/ to ten minutes actually  laura yeah you had said 15  taliesin i love walking on the wall  sam we could stay like this forever  taliesin so ill be in the middle of the group walking on the wall  sam im so beautiful  travis you look over and scanlans going kisses  sam so symmetrical  liam im actually going to hang back  matt okay so vax behind its percy and grog up front  laura im going to go up behind percy  marisha yeah ill be with vex  sam i will /none/ fly up next to grog and put my healing touch hand on his shoulder and heal him a lot  hums 31  matt you heal 31 hit points grog  sam oh plus three 34  matt there you go  sam and youre also freed from any curse disease or blindness that you have just fyi  liam im also going to dump 20 hit points of lay on hands on my own damn self  matt all righty  marisha wait is that ding to your saving throws considered a curse  matt it is a curse /none/ that can only be broken by a god  laura if he fucking brings it up to a god he doesnt even realize he has it  travis i tried to talk to pelor but people were like no dont talk to pelor  laura what are you fucking talking about  travis what are you talking about  matt grog continuing the charge forward taking the steps eventually you begin to see a source of  some light a faint orangishred light your initial instinct based on your previous travels  through here is molten rock its a very /none/ similar orangishred color from this distance as you  descend step upon heavy step upon heavy step you watch as you can see a square orange opening  below as in the pointed hallway that leads you down comes to an end and the stairs descend into  a chamber  travis ill go in  laura would trinkets little feet hurt if he was on the ground  matt do you want to put trinket out of your necklace  laura well i figure i would have tried to put him out when we got in the tunnel but /none/ if his feet  were hurting i would have put him back in the necklace  matt i would say trinkets not comfortable yeah  laura okay ill keep him in then  matt okay so as you descend grog the staircase continues below as the hallway comes to  an end and you find yourself descending into the center of a massive hexagonal chamber the walls  climb about 25 feet on each of the hexagonal sides theres one flat wall ahead of you and you  assume probably one behind though you cannot see it from your current /dung/ perspective on the staircase  you can see that the walls are still made from the long plates of intricate hammered metal black  and redtinted with dust and rock and whatever other materials were forged into the actual metal  the support girders of dark red metal marks the seam at every wallplate like when you entered  the hallway above  central to the chamber ahead of you across the wall that you see there there is a glowing pit of  heated coals about 15 feet on any side that marks the floor before a giant metal /none/ wall with two  xshaped cross beams that hit the corners of where that wall begins on each side and in the center  where they meet you see a raised relief of solid gold bolted there that surrounds an opening of  some kind theres a space in that golden relief  travis whats the floor look like from here to there the same surface  matt same metallic surface  travis any seams or just smooth  matt well no for the floor in here it would be fairly smooth  laura how high off the ground is /none/ that relief  matt its 25 feet to the ceiling and its halfway down so its about 12 and a half feet in  the center so from the ground youd have to get up to see it  travis i move closer towards that  matt okay you walk up and you come to the very bottom of the last step grunts leap onto the  ground walk forward to the edge of where the coals are there at the base of your feet you  glance up and you can see it make a perception check  travis /none/ hold on 17  matt all right you glance up and you can see the relief of solid gold the opening in it is  triangleshaped roughly one foot across from point to point like that it comes into a  triangular point and its about that size its about a foot and then a foot and then a foot  laura i think youre supposed to stick your hand in it grog  travis its just the triangle shape right theres nothing else around it  matt its a weird rough circle and then the triangle is carved into /none/ the center of it the two  walls immediately to the right and the left of that where the hexagonal pulls back to each side  you see two more of those metal warrior reliefs that you saw earlier in the hallway  travis and the coals are in a circle  matt the coals are in a square section a 15 by 15foot square section of the floor in front of  you that leads right up to the wall with the giant x meeting the seams in the relief  travis sighs might have to tony robbins this /none/ shit right  laura does it look like anythings supposed to go in the triangle does it look like a keyhole  matt it looks like a gold relief that has a triangular hole in it thats all you can see  laura can we see how deep the hole goes  matt youd have to get closer to it  laura i want to get close to it on my broom and look at it  matt all right you fly up above the coals and the heat emanating from the coals below you is  extremely hot you /none/ can see it warping the air above it so you have to protect yourself a bit  and squint the eyes and you swear you can smell the scent of burning hair and you get up close  and you can see the relief perhaps some sort of triangular or pyramidlike shape would slip into it  it looks like all the corners eventually converge to a point on the interior of it  laura okay all right i back up so that im not in the fumes  travis is there anything else in the room besides the two /none/ reliefs on either side that we can see tools  matt do you guys want to walk around the back of the staircase as you guys move around the back of  the staircase the wall on the opposite side of that relief contains a third armored warrior  relief embedded in the wall you can see there are four pillars right along the side of where the  staircase descends that contain boltedin large braziers that contain everburning flames  flickering that give that orangered glow similar to the coals you saw embedded in the  ground as you /none/ arrived and then on the back side of the staircase and the column that held it  aloft you recognize it immediately grog strangely because while youve not cared or  understood what these things are before suddenly you know what it is you see a large metal it  looks like a well almost but there is a furnace built into it and a number of tools that are  hanging to the side small tongs and heavy leather gauntlets this is a smelter  laura oh thats where we have to smelt the platinum do we see anything /none/ around the room that  looks like it could fit in that pyramid shape  sam im going to cast again detect good and evil and do a swoop around and see if i sense any  creatures or magically consecrated objects  matt okay you swoop around the room you detect no evil you detect no magically consecrated  objects and at that point the spells about to fade or become permanent  sam sighs big choice  laura you mean youll stay like that forever you cant undo it  sam yes my child i will drop the /none/ spell  matt okay and with that a smaller scanlan form appears the planetar angelic form vanishing and  he drops about four feet and lands on his feet on the ground  sam i feel my back covered in hair im back  matt and a moment later grog your form drops as well and you revert back to normal grog size  still massive  travis so were supposed to smelt the platinum right melt it down and then we use our magic  beans to make the prime trammels  taliesin do i understand how this triangle /none/ works  matt this triangle does not at all resemble any of the designs that you had imbued upon you  taliesin im going to hop up to take a better look at it as well  matt okay so you walk up the side and look into it and you can see its a triangle and then  pushing inward all the points converge on the inside where it would fit a pyramid structure  about one foot on each side corner to corner  taliesin and the point at which they connect is that about a quarter size /none/ would you say  matt the point where it connects it goes to a complete point  taliesin complete point okay  travis and that relief is in the middle of two crossbeams so you couldnt push the crossbeams  over and lay it down flat  matt well the cross beams are bolted to the actual wall  travis its not something we have to lay flat  liam did you say there were two metal warriors  matt there are two metal warriors to the right and left and then one on the back wall  liam and /none/ are they separated from where we are by hot coals or can you walk right up to them  matt the only hot coals are the ones that reside directly beneath the relief  liam okay so im going to check one of those out see if its any different than what we passed  in that hallway  marisha and you said there were three warriors  matt yes  laura and we can get to the smelter right now or its beyond the crossbeams  matt the smelter is on the other of the room behind the staircase /none/  laura all the shit we need  matt yeah  liam 24  matt 24 you approach and look up into the warrior and you can see the three of them are all  in the same stance theyre all standing square they all are clutching a long greatsword in one  hand the other appears to be open to either receive something or hold aloft something thats  not there and theyre all facing forward  liam im shooting my wings out as i walk up to them as well  matt okay whoosh your wings arc outward /none/ looking ahead you can see the armored helmet that  adorns its head that normally would pincer to where the nose is and you can see the pores of  the face the helmet is one big domed curve on top and where a face would be there is no face  theres the outside of the head and a similar triangle gap in the face thats smaller than the  one in the relief you glance over quickly into the other warrior and the third and all three of  them are faceless instead having an empty triangle that /none/ disappears into the face  liam it goes inward like the big one  matt yes but theyre smaller  marisha while he does that i stand in the middle are the three warriors triangulated if  you were to draw out a triangle between them  matt in the hexagonal room yes they would be  marisha in the same shape  matt it seems to be close enough at least based on the construction of the chamber  travis what did the reliefs have in their hands weapons swords axes hammers  matt no theyre all greatswords but /none/ theyre also part of the relief embedded in the wall  travis okay  marisha and one open hand  matt one open hand its embedded in the wall and the other one is open to the side but the relief is  all embedded in the wall and you can see the  triangular opening the only thing that darts  inward is that vacuous shape in the face  laura this is where vox machina dies because they cant figure out  taliesin we cant figure out how the triangle works  marisha is there anything on the /none/ floor any patterns on the floor  matt make an investigation check  sam the smelter is it active right now is it hot  travis yeah the coals are cooking  matt the smelter is low but its burning  sam what if we have to make something triangular  laura yeah to fit in those things  marisha 13  matt 13 doesnt appear to be the floor is pretty solid theres no real detail that catches  your attention  taliesin lets start smelting  laura yeah might as well  sam what if we take those /none/ beans and put them in the little triangle holes i dont know in their  hands  matt well the statues are in the wall and you can see the outer shape barely protruding from  the wall so it would be hard to place something in the hand  laura yeah we switched all our gold for platinum in vasselheim  taliesin yeah so lets start the smelter at the very least  matt okay the bellows are there the big old heavy bellows and grog you know exactly what to  do its a really strange phenomenon to /none/ be like ive never done this but its second nature  and you begin to get that forge to well and burn and brightly you can see the flames and the coals  heat up from dull red to a bright orange to a white at times and as it heats up you have the  tongs what do you smelt in  marisha but what to smelt in  travis im going to walk across  matt you get the sense here that smelting is the heating and liquefying of metals one to remove  impurities and two to /none/ then pour into a mold in which when it cools the metal makes the shape of  whatever the mold is  laura can i fly up to the circle on the wall on the crossbeams does it come off  matt you reach out and you touch the gold relief its built into the wall its a smooth shiny  polished gold but its not moving at all  laura we cant find anything that makes a triangle shape a pyramid shape in the room  taliesin the faces of the statuary maybe we should prod them we might /none/ as well start prodding  things because nothings going to happen if we dont prod them im going to crawl up to one of  the statuary soldiers and see if the helmet comes off or if the face is removable im going to  start tinkering  matt you reach up and grab the side and feel the side of the face and reach into the inside of the  gap in the triangular void if you will  taliesin that thing is going to go click isnt it  matt no your fingers slide in it does come /none/ to a vanishing point it comes to a point like the  larger relief once you look inside and get a glance with the little bit of light thats in  there the shape on the inside of it is different its imperfect and messed up its hard to see  what it is but its not a perfect triangle like the rest also immediately you guys see theres  a flash of orange light that completely surrounds the exterior of the warrior and the two other  warriors their entire outer line glows a bright orange and with that /none/ you instinctually step  back  taliesin i step up  matt or yeah step up as all three of them heavy movement step out of the wall unlike the  ones you saw previously that were pressed in and relief these have a little more dimension to  them and the majority of their physical form was embedded backwards into the wall they all of a  sudden come storming outward giant greatswords swinging in front of them as they all  immediately the heads creepily with the open triangular void of where a face would be spin to /none/  one of the nearby individuals in their space  laura ooh maybe we have to kill them and then smelt into their faces  taliesin im into it i like this plan  marisha dont destroy their faces  matt thats where well pick up next week because it is almost 1100  laura all right how tall are they how big were they  matt theyre about ten to 12 feet tall  laura and theyre made out of metal  matt theyre made out of the same metal material it looks like that the walls are  /none/ laura theyre golems  matt constructs of some kind  travis those crossbeams do they look like theyre structurally integral to the room  matt no theyre bolted against the far wall and it looks more ornamental or at least there are  seams against that back wall to hold a relief there or at least thats where the relief is  placed you get the sense with more inspection youd get a better feel but it doesnt look like  immediately at glance its integral to the design so well pick up right at the beginning  of those /none/ large metallic creatures emerging from the walls and the ensuing conflict next week in  the meantime thank you guys so much for joining us on the next crazy step of our adventure  marisha happy birthday  matt happy birthday yeah  laura its still for another hour thank you magic the gathering  puzzle quest  matt yes thank you puzzle quest magic the gathering edition for being our fantastic sponsor  thank you guys for watching well pick up next week and then after that is gencon  laura laughs oh jeez  matt so after next /none/
