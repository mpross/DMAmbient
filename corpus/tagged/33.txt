none	 and just grabs you and embraces you tightly you  can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she just holds you with a slight shake to her body  taliesin im so sorry for leaving you  matt i thought you were dead she pulls away for a second and just looks at you and theres a  coldness to her face shes happy but even for her young age you can see theres lines at the  corners of her eyes shes probably been through a lot she smiles and looks up at you again and 
none	 you  can see theres the white shocks in her hair and she looks up and touches your hair and goes i see  weve both survived quite a bit  taliesin i wouldnt trade  matt she laughs to herself and you see another tear curl at her eye and then her face goes cold  for a second and she not breaking this gaze steps back you shouldnt be here they were  using me to get to you im so sorry  taliesin are you all right did they do anything are you yourself  matt she 
none	 reaches up and holds her neck im good im good and she steels herself for a  second and even more so you see theres an intensity to her  taliesin perception check  matt to  taliesin insight i want to make sure shes not holding anything really important back  matt okay go for it  taliesin insight do i get a bonus for that right now its a wisdom yeah  matt no because you were concentrating  taliesin this is not a saving throw though  matt yeah and thats wisdom not a saving throw  
none	 taliesin 11  matt 11 okay best you can tell she seems very honest she seems forthright youre used to the  memory of your sister being this brighteyed cheerful youngest of the bunch and definitely a  woman who sees the world with fresh eyes these eyes are different theyre colder theyre  hardened in ways youre impressed in ways youre also immediately sad to see that that  memory of your sister probably is no longer there  taliesin were putting an end to the briarwoods tonight before the sun sets this is the end of  them 
none	 its all going to be over and were going to stop whatever it is theyre doing  under the city  matt you say this weve tried twice  taliesin i know this is it  matt thats what the others thought you left me you know  taliesin i know and im so sorry  matt good well if were going to do this lets get ready  taliesin youre going to your room  matt yes i am  taliesin to wait until this is over  matt no no im not im going to my room to

none	  taliesin oh god i do  matt you guys charging off trinkets keeping trail shes run down the stairway he is  beginning to slowly gain on her she reaches the front doors does remember the caltrops jumps  over them grabs the door opens it and rushes out into the daylight go ahead and roll a  perception check for trinket  marisha oh come on trinket  laura he saw it happen hes got really good vision  marisha come on trink  taliesin yay  laura oh yeah thats like 24  matt yeah trinket just 
none	 jumps over the doors only slightly open so trinket has to stop and  wedge his way through  laura can he cannonball into her to try to catch her  matt its the same speed as if he dashed it would be the same speed  laura all right  matt however it takes a moment to get through you guys now get down the stairs as trinket opens  the door and wedges through theres a scent out there but shes nowhere in visible range shes  either darted off the path or possibly off the actual sides 
none	 and you can see now the struggle  thats happened you can now hear in the distance the sound of yells and fighting and there doesnt  appear to be any one side or the other pushing  laura i whistle at trinket to get him to stop  matt okay as you get to the landing you whistle out and trinket is just now pushing through the  door and gets out for a bit looking back and forth looks over the shoulder and runs back to  you it appears that ripley has scattered into whitestone somewhere  
none	 sam damn it  travis we stop  matt okay  laura we need to find the briarwoods  taliesin im still upstairs are you going to come meet us again upstairs  sam well get trinket and go back upstairs wherever they are  taliesin taking a short rest  marisha were taking a short rest  taliesin were waiting there they followed her down im waiting on cassandra  travis i could stay down in that foyer  taliesin come up  matt are you waiting in the study  taliesin yeah waiting in the study  matt

none	 around  marisha do we have to put him in the bag of holding though  travis why cant we just set him on fire  marisha yeah stuff him in a closet or something for now  taliesin fire will do  travis is there a fireplace in the room  taliesin there is throw him in fine well throw him in the fire  laura wait let me see whats on him first  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin we dont want him coming back  matt hes crumpled up against the desk in the 
none	 corner theres all these papers that got pushed  off the side there were a bunch of random scrawlings  laura 24  matt 24 okay you search his body you find 120 gold pieces on him not a whole lot he doesnt  keep his important shit on him for the most part you do find however the boots that hes wearing  are very finely crafted and unlike the rest of his wear have a handstitching in it that is  exemplary in construction and doesnt match with the rest of his ensemble so it seems like  
none	 something youd wear more for function than for actual style pardon  laura i take them  matt you take them  taliesin take his shoes  matt okay  laura does anybody have magic can you see what these are  sam sure i can look at them  laura look at these scanlan  sam i look at them  matt okay if youre taking a short rest you can take the short rest to inspect the boots get the  feel for them they are indeed enchanted they are a pair of boots of levitation once per 
none	 day you  can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes as per the spell you cant actually move as part  of it you just levitate in the air and you have to push off to get space  travis so like zerog  matt zerog  taliesin like willy wonka  marisha zerog boots oh hell yeah  sam who do they fit  matt they fit anyone who wishes to put them on magical items alter themselves  marisha oh were playing with that later  travis ill just hang onto it ill just hold onto 
none	 it  marisha can we all just try them once when we get back to greyskull keep  matt anything else you want to do while youre waiting  sam anything else in the room can i sniff around the room and investigate  matt yeah go ahead and make an investigation check  travis i drag anders over to the fireplace  liam ill look with scanlan  sam 12  travis he doesnt quite fit so i have to snap some joints  liam 27  matt okay good as youre looking through and finding papers papers and 
none	 ledgers and tough  discussions of old classes untouched on the side you go through one of the bottom drawers and  theres a lock to it  liam well lets unlock that  sam vax do you need my help to unlock it  liam no shorty hold on are there any traps in there  matt make a perception check  liam oh that is 20  matt it does appear to be trapped  sam it does appear to be trapped  liam so what do i roll to undo that dexterity lockpick  matt thieves tools 
none	 as well so same check you did  sam oh i can open it for you  liam thats a natural 20 so thats untrapped  matt as part of that you notice that this mechanism is when it opens if there isnt a  switch underneath it held thats hidden it will cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction  of whoevers in front of it you hold the button you find it you open it up without an issue and  you find the spring mechanism snap it and remove the little poisontipped bolt  
none	 and chuck it to the side  laura no wait give me that i take it  matt okay you have a poisontipped bolt  laura okay  matt for a tiny little handcrossbow is essentially what it is  liam so now ive got to unlock it right  matt yeah  liam yeah hey 20  matt natural 20  liam no not a natural 20  matt oh okay easy enough to unlock at this point you get it open you pull it open theres  a collection of letters  liam percival come here youre probably 
none	 the best person to know what to make of these  matt you glance through and inspect them and you take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of  these letters while cassandras away many of them talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting  to you as the information hits you and you relay this information to the group notes on the  removal of key magical defenses during the political meeting at emon the discussion as in  making sure that certain individuals and safeguards that are usually made during political  
none	 meetings like that were not present during that endeavor  laura evidence is what that is  matt notes on best construction methods using the mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the  ziggurat  marisha and travis the manse  sam as in a mansion  matt a manse is a place or a home it has many different meanings theyre warning anders and  there are multiple letters at different periods of time over the past few years that are warning  anders of an arrival of seeker asums spies  sam hes a good guy 
none	  laura oh  sam no hes a bad guy  matt there are letters talking about plotting diverting political attention away from whitestone  to leave it a political enigma during this period of time there are letters talking about planting  information within wildmount that would lead their investigation team to believe the briarwoods had  been found dead  sam this is a whole paper trail  matt and occasionally there are mentions in a lot of these letters that speak of the undying king  shall return we are his blood  marisha jarl what  
none	 matt the undying king shall return  laura where did she get jarl from  matt we are his blood  laura oh we are  marisha the undying king  taliesin shall return  taliesin and sam we are his blood  marisha which is what he said  sam and then it says jarl  taliesin jarl maybe he was dictating  matt the letters arent signed  sam okay are they all of the same hand  matt they are all of the same handwriting in the cluster there is one completely unrelated letter  that talks 
none	 about business ledgers and construction of the bridge it appears to be a simple  discussion on the future plans to construct the bridge  sam is that in the same hand  matt it is in the same handwriting  sam and is it signed  matt it is signed a lord riskel daxio  marisha what who axio  travis and sam riskel daxio  matt riskel daxio  laura and marisha we know him  matt yep  laura who is he  matt hes on the council of taldorei  laura gasps oh motherfucker hes a 
none	 spy  marisha hes our fucking spy  matt hes technically also the one that helped designate the construction of your keep and  plotted the construction stuff  laura oh no  sam he built our keep  marisha hes the construction guy hes like our head builder  liam he could be spying on us around the keep  taliesin he could have a secret entrance to our keep that he built and didnt tell us  laura holy moly  sam as soon as i see that i go down in a crouch and i shitscry on 
none	 our keep to  see if its still there  marisha oh my god thats right you did that and i put an elemental there its babysitting  matt yes you did  marisha hopefully still there 30 days  matt 30 days glancing within the kitchen there doesnt appear to be much that catches your  attention  taliesin you shat in the kitchen  sam i put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen and i told them dont clean it up  matt like you do  sam you know  laura like you 
none	 do  sam thursdays  travis ive got anders in the fireplace and i light the firebrand war hammer with the magic  word bacon and i hit it and set him on fire  matt there was already a fire in the fireplace but you just stoke it a little further and pretty  soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh fills the room  laura bacon  travis yeah bacon did you not know thats what the word was  sam so everythings fine at the keep  matt at the time  sam at the time 
none	 okay  matt at least theres nothing on fire theres no screams theres no movement it just seems  like the cold kitchen is untouched  sam guys my shit saw no movement  laughter  laura good to know scanlan  taliesin youve squeezed all youre going to be able to get out of that  travis percy can we get into the underground caverns from here  taliesin can i think of a way im assuming i know a way to where this might be  matt as you have this conversation a voice from the doorway rings 
none	 out i can take you you look  over and its cassandra  taliesin shes going to take us  sam is that your sister  taliesin apparently  matt shes currently now dressed in armor youve seen as ornamental before it was armor that your  mother trained in when she was young but was unused for a long time it seems to be  serviceable its been updated and such she slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side and  her hair is pulled back and tied off and she looks at the rest of the 
none	 room so are we ready  travis let me see your neck  matt she steps up and lifts her chin up towards you  sam by the way this is grog  liam im going to insight check as he does that  taliesin these are my friends by the way  travis do i see anything on her neck  matt no it seems fine theres no signs of any puncture wounds rolling  liam its a 15  matt okay she seems as determined as the rest of you  laura all right  taliesin lead the 
none	 way sister  matt she turns around and she begins walking back down the hallway  laura can we expect any more traps that youre aware of  matt that im aware of no but im certain that there may be they know youre coming it seems  so be wary be careful ill take you to the undercroft  liam did we just have a short rest here  matt you did  liam going to heal up  sam hey percival any chance you can load up one of ripleys guns for me  taliesin i dont know 
none	 if it will actually i would have to probably train you in  how to use it  sam really ive seen you use it you just pull your finger on the finger part and the big boom  part goes out  taliesin its a little more complicated than that actually  sam well you have to point it at the thing you want to be boomed  matt he could use it he just wouldnt be able to add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls  taliesin ill load one for you ill give him her boomstick 
none	  matt okay you take it you inspect it as you guys are walking along  taliesin just making sure it functions too  matt it seems pretty functional its wellconstructed its sleek your pepperbox has a  bit of flair to its design this is your background hers is just streamlined simple much  like the decor of her room when you saw it she doesnt mess with anything fancy or unnecessary  the ammunition she does have are made specific to size to her pistol they will not function for the  pepperbox unfortunately they will only work 
none	 for the pistol  taliesin doing okay not doing great but im doing okay  matt it does act as a pistol for ruleswise which is on your sheet here so yes you would  have that  laura do you want it just in case yours misfires  taliesin ill steal it back from him if i need but it should be fine  sam id like to make an athletics check athletics see if i can spin it around and put it  in my pocket  laura wait where did you get it i had it in 
none	 my belt  taliesin no if you have it  laura i have it  sam okay give it to me  taliesin give it to him  marisha put your eye out  matt all right go ahead and roll dexterity roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier  liam dont roll a one  taliesin this is literally how she lost her hand  sam wait whats this why does it say plus four  laura this music is awful as youre checking  marisha yeah the violins plinking  sam well its zero but it says a 
none	 big plus four next to it for some reason  matt i dont know add zero what did you roll  sam it was 14  matt okay you manage to get it in there thankfully its not loaded because you feel the  trigger go off but there wasnt a bullet loaded so its like click  travis yeah we took out the ammunition  sam okay now give me a bullet  travis maybe dont do that  taliesin i hand him the ammunition i load four of them  sam yeah  laura giving him a loaded 
none	 gun  sam im a big boy well im a little boy but im a little big boy  liam i would like to walk past scanlan and grab it out of his hand  sam i will prevent him from doing that  matt okay  marisha you guys are fighting over a loaded gun  matt sleightofhand check athletics check  liam you go first  sam is this a skill check  matt yeah add your athletics to your roll  sam 17  liam shut up 27  matt as you go to be no what 
none	 are you its already gone you dont even know where it went  you didnt see him take it you just all of a sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you  liam and i walk over to cassandra i dont give her the gun i just say youre cassandra  matt yes  liam i was at the door he had a knife to your throat he wanted you to say something to us what  did he want you to say  matt he wanted me to shout for help he wanted me to 
none	 draw you in  laura can i insight check her to see if shes telling the truth  matt yeah  liam youve been living here how did it come that he had a blade to your throat today how did  it all unravel have you been living here  laura 24  matt 24 shes telling the truth  laura okay thats good  matt well after the arrows felled me i guess i should start at the beginning and shes  walking along with you guys as shes leading you down the stairs and down to the 
town	 bottom floor she  doesnt look to you shes still looking ahead very intent  laura i take that pistol back from you  matt after the arrows felled me i recovered father reynal found me brought me from the brink  at the temple of pelor outside of town things hadnt fallen quite that far back then we had  more people in the city at the time the briarwood rule was fresh and folks were eager to  speak out against what they had wrought on this city the fall of the de rolos  we still thought 
none	 they had fallen to plague but through some unfortunate political business they  had come to power but we began to question it i knew better i told the truth once id recovered  we began to build our first rebellion two years we built up the resistance before we made our  first move they seemed to know exactly what we were plotting cut us off at every angle  couldnt see who it was who was giving up our information but i knew it was close but before i  had the opportunity i was helming a group 
none	 that was traveling to utilize the escape route that i  took you through when they first attacked it was just after dusk and lord briarwood was there  waiting for us in the forest he slaughtered most of the men but he recognized my face from the  dinner we had the night they took the castle  they did not harm me strangely they treated me like a guest against my will in my own house i  seemed to ascertain that by keeping me there having a member of the house within their grasp  they could 
none	 use that as leverage i dont know  sylas he had his charms and there were many that worked beneath them against their own will  it did not work on me my hatred was too strong so instead they tried to provide me with wealth  power here in whitestone i just took to reading and ignoring it all i dont know why they kept me  around but i wasnt going to question it if it gave me a chance to possibly undermine them  she grabs the side of her sword as you guys have now reached 
none	 now down the long hallway towards the  back of the castle you know the direction shes taking you it leads to the cellar to the  undercroft and the de rolo mausoleum  three years of reading in that library fathers library strategy tactics old lines of  information as well as the myths and history of whitestone i found allies within the castle i  contacted yennen and through him archibald who helped me build the first rebellion  archibald still lives percy hes been completely necessary for what weve built here  she looks down at her 
none	 armor as you guys reach the edge of the cellar and she pulls the door open  quietly theres wooden stairs that lead down into the cellar she taps her armor this was  mothers its good to know im not the only tomboy in the bloodline brushes the hair out of  her face and for the first time really looks at you with a smile since she first saw you  taliesin sighs can we do one thing before we go down into the cellar this is the best day of my  life and i cant help 
none	 but be suspicious  matt i completely understand  taliesin is there any way to check if shes being controlled  travis i was thinking the same thing  taliesin can we put your helmet on her  matt the only thing you really have seen work is the greater restoration spell you cast on seeker  asum when you guys were with the council of taldorei that did seem to remove any sort of  charm effects if thats what youre asking  laura we dont have that  marisha i didnt learn it not for today i thought 
none	 pikes magic would hold up  travis i can try and jog her memory  matt what can i do to make you trust me  sam punch her in the face  taliesin i do trust you thats the problem  matt she smiles a little whatever you need  taliesin ive got nothing sighs  matt does anyone have any creative means with which they would want to check  taliesin what would happen if we put your helmet on her  marisha if shes already controlled  taliesin this would disrupt it maybe  marisha we could 
none	 try it it doesnt hurt to put a hat on  laura it has to be attuned over a short rest though  marisha it does  taliesin does the hat need to be attuned over a short rest  matt in theory  liam i want to suggest something to you we rest here for a half hour and i give this to you this  came from a very strange creature it will help you resist any control if there is any control  and one of us you could even choose could strike you and try to 
none	 take you out of it and if  you are not being controlled then you are being struck across the face and im sorry for that  but if you are theres a possibility wed pull you out i know that would hurt but it would go a  long way to earn our trust  matt if thats what it takes she takes it from your hand and inspects it for a second shoddy  craftsmanship places it on her head and its a little big at first  then it conforms to her head  liam your choice 
none	  matt she sits down a couple of steps deeper into the cellar curls around a corner ushers you all  over into the shadows  marisha can i see before we leave are we near any windows  matt from this location no all the windows that would be here would face out into the north side  of whitestone which is forested  marisha backyard  matt you guys are on the north side of the castle now the city is south from you  marisha all right  matt so you take a moment and sit while 
none	 you guys are waiting she takes a moment shes adjusting  it and feeling it and inspecting her hands sighs i dont feel any different  while we wait  liam what if the little one struck you  sam struck her  laura give it some time  matt she gives a wry grin whatever you choose  sam i could try to tell if shes evil or not would that help  laura yeah  liam i dont know i dont think shes evil she could be a puppet  marisha can i try this this is a 
none	 long shot my actually our fey ancestry from being halfelves  were immune to charm effects or we have resistance  liam resistant to it  marisha advantage against saves since we have that can we use our fey ancestry the three of  us to tap into her and see if we can detect a charm  matt your resistance doesnt make you attuned to it unfortunately its just a natural ability  thats inherent her being human theres not a way to really correlate with that i mean youve  read over her a few times doing insight

none	 whitestoneconstructed stairs descend for about 45  feet before they level off into the de rolo mausoleum a long hallway continues forward that  contains two tenbyten stone structures that contain the entombed bodies of previous  generations of de rolos with six passages three on each side that split off of this main hallway  that contain their own stoneencapsulated corpses this is a place of silent prayer and showing  appreciation for the previous families not all of them are full and there were extensions planned  as the family grew but the first thing you notice is 
none	 all of the tomb doors are open  is anyone holding a torch light source going through this  laura hes got his flaming war hammer  marisha yeah and ill light up my hands  taliesin i think i still have a torch actually  matt have you been carrying it with you throughout this  taliesin yeah  matt okay  liam dagger  matt okay so you have enough light sources to keep a general idea of whats going on and i know  a lot of you guys have darkvision too so you have a pretty

tavern	 de rolo youre drunk  matt all right so you progress through the undercroft as quietly as possible you notice as  you get past the first section you look to your right and left and the inside of these small like  cubby offshoots that contain these separate ten by ten stone tombs the walls have shelves burrowed  into it in which there are urns and small gems and offerings things that were buried alongside  the family members as part of a remembrance  liam and laura make snatching noises  matt yeah no dont go skyrim 
none	 on me  taliesin yeah not fun  matt once again you see the doors are open and from what you can tell the stone lids on the  tombs are pulled off and to the side across the way as you move towards the center of the room to  the second set of openings you can see the far wall which the room ends in the far side but  there is about a 15 20foot wide and about a ten to 15foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall  and the closer you get you see 
none	 large piles of dirt that fill one side of the room were put off  to the side as if pieces of this dig were discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the  ground that appears to have not been very well cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and  out of this area you also see as you push twothirds into the room broken pieces of  whitestone that had been carved into what looks like parts of walls or pillars support things  that failed in their construction and just broke and 
none	 were tossed and discarded to the side make a  perception check  marisha oh  taliesin oh natural 20  sam jesus  travis what the flipping fuck man  taliesin i had a one today  matt a one  travis and four 20s  taliesin i had a one  matt one of you critters out there has to get taliesin a really really pretty new d20 that he  has to use going forward  taliesin thats shapewayscom  matt not that one  laughter  matt all right so what did you get  marisha

none	 can see shapes through  it but its opaque enough to the point where it distorts a little bit of the visual and color  behind it  marisha can i do a nature check on this is this similar to the broken glass that i collected  before  matt which broken glass you collected before  marisha i dont know i just have broken glass shards  travis i feel like that was the red stones or something from before  marisha i feel like there was some sort of  taliesin there was that sea of glass 
none	  marisha yeah we were in some cavern  matt oh the sea of bone and glass okay yeah it is not similar to that no however those who  are trained in arcana you can go ahead and make an arcana roll  laura trained in arcana  matt trained in arcana  laura how do you know if youre trained in arcana  travis negative two  matt you would have filled in if you have a proficiency  sam the dot  taliesin the dot  laura oh  sam oh 11  matt you have really
