/none/ oh okay this is apparently working hi im just trying this out because i saw matt and marisha do  it and it was pretty amusing so i thought i would try this out because why not hi hey everybody  i also cleaned my room so i finally decided it would be reasonable to see how that worked  laughs oh wow yes it is thursday and i have just a tiny bit of time to kill before i have to  leave the house to go deal with reality so i did say i would give a small /none/ tour now that everything  is clean so yeah here let me show you around this is actually my room i live with roommates so  this is where i spend most of my time heres some of the critical role art on the wall terrifying  things tardis closet because why not yeah every room ive lived in for the past couple years has  been purple it is a thing my teeny tiny little desk is currently ridiculous my plan for the day  is to ive got to pick up a friend from a vo meeting and /none/ then go say hi to a few people here  is the ridiculous collection of dead things which goes on forever thats the project that im  working on i shouldnt show that but i dont know purple just became a thing its fun heres  the booklet this is the really fancy book collection dont know if i can say where im  going today i tend to try not to say such things theres several different skulls oh yeah theres  this stuff too its just one of my freezedried mice little bits and pieces of things this /none/ is kind of  cool this is a bioshock fish tank which is currently on loan from our friend courtney king  who is currently away at college our little bubbly bubbly friend i do put the mohawk up on  occasion it has been quite a while since ive done just because its a pain in the ass im  actually going to be messing up my hair quite a bit soon theres going to be new hair probably  after whitestone which will be kind of ridiculous well see its i really dont think  about it as /none/ often as i should yeah thank you that tank was actually built for a friend of ours  by fan builds its the same people who do who do the sword builds online manatarms you can  check out the whole process that they went through to build it there is a video on youtube thank  you for being a fan its fabulous and yeah thank you the purple refuses to die its quite  nice but man theres going to be some really ridiculous hair soon laugh i dont know if any  of my friends would appreciate /none/ me getting a gun tattooed on my scalp but yes i cant im  definitely not going to talk about i have no idea what tonights going to be like but its  definitely going im nervous as all hell so thats always fun yeah the hair will be ridiculous do  we watch any other dd streams every now and then ill pop into a few of them i tend to try and  keep quiet i watch other streams on geek and sundry mines and crafts im kind of amused by i  find it really nice to /none/ clean to i am very excited about the conclusion of everything and im really  hoping i dont die but just in case i do i have who plans for something else to do i really am  trying not to bet on it singapore oh my god and as for building ive got a long list of stuff i  want to build that ive had a long list of stuff i wanted to build for years so im just slowly  making my way through it mike mcfarland is amazing to work with hes super super cool hes /dung/  actually let me crash in his house for a while when i was living in texas and hes crashed in  mine he is fun to party with hes fun to work with he likes actors youd be amazed how many  people dont like to work with actors who work with actors professionally hey hi dear laughs  thats awesome yeah i gave a little i should probably give a little bit more of an art tour i  suppose actually kit since youre here i should show you something so yeah thats what your  stuff looks /none/ like framed on the wall so that happened right kitty corner about the back right  there ive got some community prints that i got a while back you could focus some ridiculous  stuff vintagey creepy photos that everyone has to do were hoping ashley comes back theres a  little crocheted tardis because those are adorable yes and mary blair because mary blair  is awesome my copy of kamondi the last boy on earth my little ridiculous goth kid collection of  dead things i couldnt be happier with how percys story has been coming out its /dung/ really the  best i could have possibly hoped for its everything i want and more oh yeah i should show  you one of my cousins photos thats right im amazed that you remember that heres my dead  cousin on the wall bless her heart having fallen down the stairs laughs yeah i have a  feeling that the sisters is going to go really badly oh god we have so much i try almost all  the art in my house is my friends of mine with some exceptions so its one of the reasons why we /none/  have lots of really nice art is that we get friend discounts theres another couple wonderful friend  discount pieces if you have friends who are artists its a really good way to get your house  filled with nice stuff this is another friend laura peters who did the four of these oh yeah  no actually there might be mild nudity in the background and i do apologize this is kind of a  fun piece as well but yeah we collect a lot of the art a lot of the art models and all of these /none/  paintings are actually friends as well its kind of my roommates and i have known each other for  a very long time and we know the community around here yay mild nudity adventurers league game  no i dont know what the dd adventurers league game is but yeah the stained glass spiderwebs  ive had since i was a teenager hi from germany again all these places ive never been i have  two roommates at the moment and i have two cats and we have chickens yes i like tucks gift  although i havent finished /none/ reading it yet theres a lot there no although we do have voice  actors come crash on our couch every now and then the cats are currently in trouble because they  discovered one of the roommates yarn collections that did not go well wow yeah actually ill go  annoy the chickens thats pretty adorable its going to get very bright very quickly and i  apologize for that and currently i dont i dont know if you guys know but california is  currently droughts the word the garden is currently dead and being replanted we have /none/ a  little studio in the back they think theyre getting fed theyre so excited you guys are not  getting fed no im just going to sit here and stare at you they are dumb as sticks but they  definitely give us eggs and occasionally soup theyre cute hi guys and yes they are very  loud studio ill show the studio at another time its currently locked up at the moment but  that would be do that some other time hi from canada also god i do actually travel i swear  but these are all /none/ places i havent been i just got back from alaska which was amazing in san  francisco to see my brother other than that chicago ive been to thank god i love chicago  and portland i love portland i actually have a lot of friends in portland hopefully well be  going back soon i am working on it have i been to compton actually yes i have friends in  compton we hang out on occasion its been a while but you know i dont know if im coming to  akon and in fact if you would /none/ like any of the critical role people at your conventions just bug  your conventions about it and well try although we can only travel so much during the year before  we all fall down and lapse into comas how do i roll so many d20s i dont know and it could end  at any moment i dont know if you saw me on group hug but those were not my dice and i still  rolled really really well i think for every wil wheaton in the world theres an antiwheaton and  maybe ive just gotten /none/ lucky but yeah well i sacrificed chickens for good soup at the very  least so but that is well see perhaps tonight will be the night where i roll terribly and  everybody dies laughs but yeah were hoping to come to the uk soon that would be really cool  and well see how the briarwoods and im really im genuinely very very nervous thursdays are  always nervewracking until we get to the studio and then it all kind of chills out once were  actually playing it does not say silas loves you it just says /none/ some other things what are  we oh nothing fun yet oh my chalkboard changes every month or so depending on what im  working on i had a big glass closet mirror at my last place i lived and i would cover it in notes  but that was a while ago the chickens are definitely sacrificial man theres nothing that  reinforces the theory of being a carnivore like owning chickens they are walking meat it is  just laughs is percy going to turn evil god i hope not critmas is already a technical  nightmare i /none/ dont know if we could possibly put more effort into that than the show some nights  there has not been one that has gone smoothly we dont know if ashleys going to be there were  trying really hard because it would make life so much easier if she could be there tonight but  its still up in the air she is sadly at the mercy of larger forces oh thank you i surround  myself with badass and adorable people and they just rub off weve actually done a couple la  critter meetups when kit was /town/ in town possibly at some point thats actually not a bad idea  therere a couple coffee shops and ill tell you what if i get work done i know this is a  terrible way to do things but i go to coffee shops to work and if i have one of those days  where i get work done really quickly ill just tweet out where i am i really like mobys was  where we had the last one i do spend a lot of time at mobys coffee shop the bourgeois pig also  is really /none/ nice one question lilith or zahra but thats not fair i refuse to answer that  especially with one of them listening crit role flashmob that would be great the comic yeah i  suppose i should describe put out some words about the comic really quickly that would  be helpful geek and sundry basically said that they wanted to do a critical role comic and  we were marisha and i write stuff together anyways this is what we do for id say fun but  what we do to make money were like great thats a great /none/ idea weve already got some  thoughts and im like but we want to do four panels a week so we want to do a comic strip for  four panels a week were like okay we can do that too so its going to be theres only so  much story you can tell in four panels so our first run of six or seven is very lighthearted  its very simple well were kind of going very calvin and hobbesish with the whole vibe of it  keeping it very sweet and very cute it does tell a /none/ story that will be im going to do at least  little liner note blurbs for all of them or marisha will do a few explaining what were doing  and why but please if you do post it online link to the actual page because we did write  something for that and also the more views it gets the more likely theyll be to say lets do a  full comic book now or maybe something else cool so please the full story is basically okay i  suppose im going to write this down at some point /none/ but ill do it now ill at least explain  some of it now our first winters crest festival game was basically divided into two parts and the  first half of the night was very much fun and ridiculous and basically all of us running around  a festival and then the second half of the game is where the festival all broke down into giant  chaos and we had to fight stuff and things got crazy so the comic strip is basically a lot of  the little vignettes of things that happened at the festival which /none/ we then filled in and ill get  to this later but we then filled in with some stories of our group trip to the renaissance faire  which was very much in line with the winters crest festival and we may even be showing some  pictures of the group trip to the renaissance faire and how that all turned out this is  ridiculous theres no part of my room that isnt a purple background yeah so everything was  pretty much precritical role and we did do a group trip to renaissance faire which was pretty  /none/ ridiculous i think a few photos of that are online and so the comic strip will all be social  encounters there will be no battle in the comic strip but it will also lead into something else  that were working on that i cant talk about yet but theres a few really cool things i love the  texas renaissance faire ive been there several times so therell be some stuff connecting into  that but i cant i would get killed i will get start getting text messages from everybody else  telling me to shush and /none/ yeah how am i doing on time before i have to no ive got a few more  minutes whose backstory do i really im hoping we hold off on grog until pike gets back because  theyre kind of interwoven honestly i really want to get into scanlan and i really liked our one  dip into keyleth and i know out of game some of the stuff thats going on with keyleth so im  kind of down with that i mean id love to see the twins too but again like of what i know  theres /none/ like weird stuff with scanlan we havent gotten into and theres weird stuff with keyleth  that we havent gotten into has matt ever let anything slip before a game that helped you guys  out no the most he said was five months ago when he asked me for my updated backstory document and  his only comment was you should really get that shit together soon would be nice and but again  its been three years yeah fear of orcs theres just something there i really want to get into  and maybe will again we never /none/ know where were going to go with any of this and matts always got  everything worked out oh thank you have fun at work or you know have a productive day of work  and hopefully therell be an episode for you tonight nothing will go terribly wrong the  vampire bit was entirely his idea i didnt tell matt when it came to percys backstory i didnt  tell matt anything that percy didnt know i just described the events as best as percy could  describe them so he didnt know anything about who the briarwoods were /none/ he didnt know whether or  not his sister was dead or alive he it was just his experience and i did not multiclass into  warlock i know everyone keeps thinking that i did but that is not what happened its the comic  strip going to be in iambic pentameter the comic strip is going to have almost no dialogue so yes  well go with yes yeah well the pics in percys video were all chosen by matt and were again  hmm cant talk where do i want the art to go yeah wendys killing it /none/ i dont think about where  i want the art to go im invested in the game so i dont i know that theres a lot of  speculation as a group we dont really speculate if that makes sense were not really we mostly  just sit around and giggle oh hey kyle i didnt see you there whats up man a lot of friends  watching this this is very odd but yeah we dont really speculate as a group matt and i had  a lot of talks about the level up and i was staring at /dung/ luck for a little while because it  would have been so useful but it seemed kind of cowardly to take for a character like mine whose  disadvantages are all based on the ability for everything he has to go wrong and the magic  initiate just made sense that maybe is kind of a good character moment to start taking advantage of  his ability to having like that bonus d6 came out of nowhere and we just sort of turned it into  a thing whats the most ridiculous thing that party percy has done sam riegel /none/ is the best at  ridiculous he really is good at coming up his very first usage of burt reynolds was amazing but  its definitely percys most ridiculous im not entirely sure there was there was some there were  some good prestream stuff that was i felt bad because the stream came in and like when we  started this we were in a story arc that percy had very little percy was just uncomfortable and  tired and cold and really not enjoying himself and then also the stream took a little while to get  used /none/ to it was a little odd burt reynolds came from sams depraved imagination and ill say with  the magic initiate thing it was perfect also because percys never really going to delve into  magic because its just not his jam and so its perfect to give him just the touch of it but now  i can kind of move on and again theres a couple cantrips that help me and theyre really  wonderfully character appropriate and theyll come out soon he probably does he was very proud  and excited to play starscream care to share /none/ any of percys next tinkerings ill share one of  them which is i need a better and easier way to make bullets not bullets technically but musket  balls so thats going to be a big thing and then getting the diplomacy glove to function a little  more easily as required silencer actually weirdly the problem with the silencer is to use  the technology and the time to build a silencer means its one use which is a lot of effort for  one shot and its just not useful ive explained who the last barrels for /none/ this story arc is the  darkest moment other than other than pike nearly dying this is pretty much the darkest moment  weve ever had i think this is going to be the last episode again i cant guarantee it but it  really feels like that yeah ive been ive been showing part of the deal with the inventions  that percy makes is i really have to make a case to matt that i could build it back then laughs  so yeah ive got lots and lots of pictures right now sharing about the glove works /none/ and going no  really this will work ive got a plan the sun tree is interesting as the sun tree was entirely  invented by matt i dont know what the first official how do you want to do this was i think  its just something he said from the getgo he might have even been saying in our previous game  that we played i promise you that whatever happens with percy it will be somebody else who  kills him yeah i actually like the interesting thing is i do actually know how a shot was /none/ made i  used to work in the educational group that did the renaissance faire teaching military history to  kids a history of weaponry and development so i actually have a design for basically a thing that  would actually make them at a much higher rate one of the firstit was actually a just precivil  war system for making ammo at high speeds but i have to just run it by him and i actually have to  make it and the rolls are always really tricky yeah that kit is awesome im highly entertained  and /none/ im going to use it for things at some point in the near future no the fun names actually  usually come in the moment i dont really plan i dont plan anything i really dont there are no  stupid questions just stupid people no mercer is an evil twisted bastard yeah every good man  has a bad man inside and making it all possible whats the one thing you hope will happen to percy  in the future i would like the weight of this hanging over him to get shifted i would like  thanks kyle /none/ i would like i would like to try playing the character without him having a new  attitude towards himself and im kind of curious to see if that works out and percy is a nobleman  they dont marry for anything other than property so marriage is about property fun is fun letting  this go how many plague masks have i gotten none actually although i have a friend whos probably  going to build me an official one at some point based off of our very serious designs i can show  this really quick we all /none/ miss hannibal this is the raving hat collection that goes on forever  and you can see a couple of the masks and then we actually have some of our masks we have a bit of  a mask collection on the wall a few of the masks are hiding in here and we have more we actually  have hat boxes filled with stuff oh the hats theres my mad hatter hat so thats a thing oh  god more hats no we have too much stuff im not going to feel guilty were going to be angry at /none/  matt if the party tpks really does the de rolo coat of arms have a family motto yes it does  although i havent had it translated into latin yet which is why i havent put it out there but  the english translation is the fool sees not the tree the wise man sees ive been trying to get  that translated into latin yeah no i like the big battles because whats a game without  risk and the games not entertaining without really poor decisions and bad ideas poor  decisions and bad ideas are what /none/ make a great game the fool sees not the tree the wise man  sees so i love it when everything goes wrong its so much more fun when everything goes wrong  and im excited to see everything go wrong tonight i want it to be horrible i want it to be  terrifying the triceratops was genius grog running in screaming bloody murder was genius i  mean that just turned into a giant cluster of stupid that was just fun to watch keyleth  breaking off and running into the and we knew she was going to /none/ do it keyleth breaking off and  running into the skeletons was great because then it means that led to the phenomenal return of  you couldnt have had pike pull that off the pike moment was built by just the sorts of character  decisions that lead to a good game is that a frank lloyd wright conversation i am actually not  named after the frank lloyd wright house im named after a welsh bard but his house is named  after the same person i am love me some keyleth jenkins i actually i will say that /none/ keyleth is  one of my favorite characters in the game just because she leads to some too many people play  i like that some people play smart i try and play smart just because i was brought into the game as  kind of a ringer originally the idea being like we have all these new people and then we need  somebody whos played the game who can kind of just be there to make sure nothing horrible happens  and so part of percys original intent was to sort of be a safety net and to /none/ let everybody figure out  what the game was for and not getting away which was also why hes kind of meek his design was to  sort of sit there and just be a cannon for those moments where everything goes wrong yes the  tiger lilies are amazing i love them ive seen them live a couple times but now thats kind of  not an issue anymore and now its just like i love it that theres people who play it safe and  im trying to play it less safe but like scanlan and keyleth know /none/ how to and grog really know how  to not play it safe i dont think we can handle one more person not playing it safe but  you really need players who are willing to jump into the fray chvrches  is amazing i havent seen them play live yet but i really like chvrches vax definitely  overestimates himself which is great and vex can be bought which is great i love that we have a  character that can be bought we have a character that overestimates themselves we have a character  who is way too /none/ interested in violence we have a character whos way too add and then we have a  character whos morally obligated to be superman and its great really kyle ill doublecheck  that but i have a friend with a my poor friend with a latin degree and i have to make sure that  she feels useful on occasion percy doesnt have tension with anybody in the party percy i would  imagine is probably closest to keyleth its just because hes kind of snobby and shes titled and  no matter how nice and kind he is he /none/ definitely had a lifetime of understanding the difference  between having a title and not having a title i thought about gun for chvrches and i just  didnt at some point in the near future maybe even a day if im feeling fancy im going  to take my personal percy playlist my personal percy playlist thats a lot of alliteration and  augment it on my on my spotify playlist and add some of the songs that i cut and a few more that  i thought about putting on but like didnt quite hit i know i /none/ call it pulling the gendo ikari  thats how i think any time im doing that im looking at the board thinking really hard and im  trying to get out of the there are so many things we didnt have to think about before we  were streaming that now we have to think about its the gendo and im trying really hard to stop  doing that but its god its such a nice way to think so much forehead but yes i am aware and  its one of those things that i try and do less /none/ and one of the ways i do that is i try and have a  coffee mug in front of me at all times because it gives me something to do with my hands i love  gendo hes such a mess im a mess believe me im a mess im sure at some point well do one of these  where we talk about no one ends up doing stuff like this for a living without having some serious  personal issues i dont remember im pretty sure were taking next week off so i would guess  thank /none/ you that show i never got to see but im a big fan of the soundtrack of it the tom waits  tom waits also has like seven albums that are playing nonstop but any last questions before i  kill the stream whoa oh my god back to what did i think of sam losing to liam in the great who  looks better actually i voted for liam i may have inspired that laughs they were arguing about it on  our there was a little cute back and forth on our text stream and i said take /none/ a twitter poll  and sam went i will take a twitter poll and posted it at the very next moment and so i was  kind of giggling at his hubris what will percys primary motivation be after the briarwoods are  gone i dont know what does somebody do when theyve been in the revenge business for so long  maybe dread pirate roberts im not sure cassandra may or may not be a vampire i dont  know whats going to happen im trying to see if i have a picture of the actual cassandra around  /dung/ here almost all of my siblings are named after friends of mine and im trying to see if theres  a picture of cassandra in the bathroom that would be funny shes painted blue thats no help  laughs but yeah well see it depends on how things go anyway guys this has been fun thank  you for checking this out and ill see you tonight talk to you later
