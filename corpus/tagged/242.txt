just so you guys know we know there is a bit of an audiosync issue thats  happening right now its apparently not on our end our systems are syncing just fine it might  be a twitchside thing hopefully theyre working on it right now and seeing if we can figure out  how to /none/ get that fixed in the meantime my apologies we will continue playing and at the  very least the upload will be synced so keep an ear out thank you for your patience technical  all righty so catching us up from last week vox machina goes to hell in tying up loose ends and  dealing with lingering business youve decided to travel to the nine hells of baator specifically  the second layer of dis to where the iron city of dis under the rule of dispater to seek out the  place where hotis the rakshasa which /tavern/ is now in a chain of perpetually hunting members of your team  you decided it was best to end it there as the only way to kill the entity is to destroy it on  its own home plane  so you gathered yourselves you transported via keyleth onto the second layer of hell you  wandered incognito as various demonicadjacent entities youve avoided a modicum of interest or  other issues youve made friends and signed a contract for aid with a cambion owner of some sort  of tavern in the vicinity you met with a silly /none/ shop owner you ate soul crystals little soul  stones and youve agreed to for safe passage into the subterranean prison of mentiri which  apparently houses hotis as hes reforming youve come to discover you will go and assassinate a  pit fiend named utugash who is the superior of the individual you signed the contract with and  upon his destruction and without leaking any information that could tie this individual to the  assassination be granted passage safely and unspoiled into the prison to seek out your quarry  slay it and return home safely  as /none/ you snuck into the home of this pit fiend you quickly discovered a dwarvish female had endured  quite some torture and was found chained to a table you released her and she introduced  herself as tova actually i dont believe you ever introduced yourself you didnt give a name  did you  noelle its in there somewhere  matt im sure it was somewhere in there  laura yeah she said her name  matt i think you did okay good little else though  laura i wrote it down  marisha i know that means it /none/ happened  matt there you go that was awesome  laura i also wrote down chain devils know i dont know what that note meant  noelle oh my god what do they know  travis you were tripping last session  marisha because the chain devil potentially knew  laura about the bastion of flesh is that what it was  marisha yeah  matt well there you go  laura it was just chain devils know period  noelle very broody  matt chain devils period no no period just dont  laura that too  matt however /none/ your new dwarven friend transformed into some sort of a lycanthrope werebear taking a  greatsword from grogs stash in the bag of holding you gave chase over one of the guardians  and keepers of the stronghold killed it and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold  killed them and in doing so alerted other members of the stronghold and grog creeping forward down  this hallway revealed a central chamber where betwixt two pools of what appear to be molten  glowing blood and sitting upon a throne the corpulent grotesque sweaty slick pit fiend /none/  named utugash sits there the terrible toothy grin who speaks telepathically into your mind  so what do you bring to me to pleasure and i need you all to roll initiative  laura oh god that quickly huh  travis telepathically  matt yeah just like the last one spoke to you  travis are people just too lazy to use their mouths  taliesin mouths are for eating not for talking  marisha its like texting in hell  matt kind of yeah all righty folks so given that point 25 to 20  liam 24  /none/ laura 24  travis whatever  matt 20 to 15 who has what  sam 19  taliesin 15  noelle 16  travis samesies  noelle oh were going together yeah  marisha 17  sam wow we all did pretty well  marisha yeah we did for us  laura whatd you roll  sam were all between 15 and 24  matt all right so as the pit fiends still just standing there its arm hanging over the edge of  this giant axe its using propping it it stares at grog it seems to be completely /none/ lazy  confident and doesnt feel threatened whatsoever by the presence of this goliath that has stepped  into its visual range however top of the round vax and vex what do you guys want to do  liam take it  laura no you go  liam okay  matt so you guys are right there  liam clicking the boots of haste im going to now i know that theres a clot of people but i  have a lot of movement now so im going to slide back towards grog no towards tova thats a big  /none/ bear at the other entrance towards the other entrance oh thats a wall  laura theres no other entrance  matt the only entrance you know of is this one right there  laura we really should have gone up and looked at it up close before  matt thats okay now you know  liam then im going to slide along the wall up to where grog is  matt okay you move along on this side  liam yeah am i within range of oily guy whats the distance though ten feet  matt the distance between you /none/ and utugash would be 25 feet  liam 25 feet all right  laura kill him  liam little test run lets dagger dagger dagger  matt okay  liam okay because i dont know if hes really there or not first one is 33  matt that hits  liam yeah good thats 12 plus eight nine  laura i was just thinking because its at the same time technically our moves could i send  trinket in  matt trinket into the room or just into the hallway  laura well that way trinkets next to him so /none/ that my brother gets better  doesnt he get better  matt trinket from here would be five ten 15 20 25 30 35 40  trinket has a speed of 40 right  travis i think thats right  laura i think so yeah could he get there  matt trinket can get there  laura oh god that is so scary i dont know now that im saying it if thats the way to go  travis go with your instincts  laura heres my question  sam we have a backup bear  laughter  laura while /none/ hes figuring out his shit if trinket falls and i dont see him does he still  come into ravens slumber if its within 100 feet or do i have to have visual  matt you dont know  laura gasps matthew mercer  travis you know there is really one way to find out  matt no as long as the enchantments in the radius its fine  laughter  laura then hes going to do that so that you have a better attack on him  liam well im going first so ive got the goods already  /none/ laura motherfuck whatever  matt you rush in you get there  liam first blade goes and im going to smite him  matt are you waiting for trinket to get there before you throw  liam no im not i went already  matt all right go for your attacks  travis but you could hes saying you could have your advantage on that  liam i have it because im going before because im smiting him first hits for 55 total  matt 55 points of damage slick  liam thats the first the second is a 20 /none/ to hit and the third is a 27 to hit  matt all three hit  liam the next one i will try  noelle what could possibly go wrong  laura just keep saying that  liam so he has to save against a dc 15 for poison on the second attack  matt no it doesnt hes immune  liam yeah i figured id try the next is nine plus psychic damage damn it 12 so a total of  14 just for those two attacks and then i will use some more movement to move past grog /none/ still in  the hole pressed against the outside of the door out of his sight  matt okay so youre now hiding against this side of the wall there as trinket runs in into the  center of the area as trinket rushes in and rushes up to the side of the pit fiend  what are you doing  laura im going to back up next to tova wait whos the big guy whats that big thing  is that doty  matt thats doty  laura okay im going to get closer to doty and im going /none/ to hold my attack until i have visual  and then im going to have trinket attack him since i dont have visual on him right now as my  bonus move so hes just going to get one attack  matt all right let me check one thing real fast on beastmaster you are technically taking the  attack action yourself ill allow it  laura you said i can get my attacks and then have trinket be my bonus action because he can do one  attack as my bonus action single attack on bonus for bestial fury /none/  matt thats true yeah ill allow it how it usually works is your action is the attack and  then as a bonus action you can give it its like youre both attacking at the same time youre  holding your action but it is still an attack action so ill allow it go ahead and use it  its fine  laura all right hes going to just be in there roaring get them trink  hes going to roll a 21  matt 21 hits  laura yay whoa thats a 15  matt awesome are trinkets /none/ attacks magical  laura well hes a really magically charismatic masseuse  matt so trinket gets an attack scrapes the claw gets up there as it runs into the room the claw  strikes slashes across the front of the belly of the giant red pit fiend it doesnt do as much  damage as you hoped it would  laura does it do any damage  matt it does some damage but not as much as youd hoped all righty that ends your turn  youre holding your action until you have visual on the pit fiend taryon what /none/ are you doing  sam its rather stuffy in here so we should open a window ill run up to right in front of vex and  slap a window on the wall  matt okay  noelle did you run out of doors  sam ive run out of doors  laughter  sam i came with one but i have two windows  matt so for the purposes of this this is now a window here  marisha does it have nice romanstyle shade and then little baskets  matt yeah no its beautifully carved yeah it was /none/ like some italian architects  designed this beautiful  sam its a casement window so i have to go squeaking  laughter  matt perfect so to taryon use your action to rush forward you rip off the patch slam the  patch on the side and you watch as the stone suddenly crumbles to dust in that space window is  now open in the side of that wall as soon as that happens  laura i attack  matt vex go make your attack  laura okay  matt two against the pit fiend  laura two against /none/ i want to do bramble shot as my first attack  matt go for it  laura okay oh 30  matt 30 hits go ahead and roll damage  laura okay so i get sneak attack because trinkets next to him  matt yep  laura okay 4d8 seven plus ten is 17 17 just for that brambleness and then he has to roll a  strength saving throw of dc 17  matt thats cocked yeah rolled a 20  laura okay 15 17 plus three is 20 three lightning damage of that and then sneak attack is /none/  another six  matt nice all righty  laura so thats the first attack  matt go for it second attack  laura second attack what was that 21  matt 21 hits  laura all right whats five plus eight is that 13  noelle yes  laura 13  noelle why are you asking me im a bear notoriously bad at math  liam moneybags what the hell  laura 15 with two lightning damage 16 17  matt all righty so both arrows fire off you watch as the one slams into the side of utugash /none/  and the vines wrap around utugash brings one arm up tears them off of his body picks up the axe  and hefts it over the shoulder looking back at where the window now exists where once there  was none looks over and sees you and taryon through the window  laura am i allowed to move back at all or duck under the window  matt you could attempt to make a hide but he was looking directly at you  you can move on inside  laura well i probably cant hide isnt that a bonus /none/ action  matt yeah you already used bonus action  laura so if i just move out of the way  matt so yeah you can move out of the way if you want  laura okay  matt this way or this way  laura towards doty  matt towards doty okay so youre going to move on the other side of doty thats going to be your  movement there  laura okay  matt okay cool that is going to bring us to taryon did you want to do anything with doty  sam well he cant /none/ fit through a window laughs  matt how bigs the window in size  sam its two feet by four feet i believe  matt he could pull through but its going to take half his movement to do so  sam ill just say doty go back up grog  matt and doty runs this way five ten 15 20 25 30 35 doty gets right there just crammed  through the hallway and squeezed through and thats going to be where doty stays all right  that ends your turn all right at this point now utugash puts /none/ one hand up and gives some sort of a  marker in the air youre not quite sure what the meaning is or what its doing youre the only one  who really sees it taryon  travis i cant see it  matt well you see it too grog actually  travis i totally know he was sings dancing dancing dancing  sam i dont have any idea  matt you dont actually he just goes like  sam oh semaphore  matt thats it all right keyleth then tova and grog youre on deck so  marisha okay /none/ im going to scooch vex over be like sorry excuse me i just want to and into  the window and i want to do  laura im not next to the window anymore  matt taryon is you moosh past taryon  marisha oh sorry excuse me tary blight  matt blight okay  all blight  marisha bees  matt range on blight is 60 feet right  marisha 30  matt 30 feet  marisha am i within 30 feet  matt youre going to have to get closer  sam each one of those squares in /none/ the room with him are ten feet squares right  matt each square is five feet its five ten 15  sam the big squares are ten yeah  matt yeah the big squares are ten  liam its hard to see the smaller ones  marisha all right  matt so youd have go through the window to do it  sam sings come to my window  matt and laura sing come inside  marisha yeah sure ill go through the window  matt okay so you step through you get about there you have ten feet more /none/ movement so thatll  do it all right so  marisha can i blight and then back out back through the window  matt youre not going to have enough movement youll get up into the window you wont get all  the way through  marisha grunts shit  matt that is a 21 whats your dc  marisha fuck are you serious 20  matt yeah so takes half damage go ahead and roll damage  sam wait he took damage though  marisha only half damage  sam because hes immune to magic or something is that /none/ whats going on  matt no you learned as the last battle that pit fiends as do most devils have magic resistance  they have advantage on saving throws against spells you figured this information  when you researched  laura and only magical weapons can damage them or they have resist on nonmagical weapons  matt they seem to have resistance from nonmagical weapons from the research youve  done yeah  laura based on my lack of trinket attack fullness  marisha 32 total and yeah am i able to like barrel roll like through the window  /none/ matt you get up partway through the window and thats the extent of where you go  marisha hang on wait  laughter  laura id like to think one of your antlers caught and youre like yelps  marisha not like this  laughter  matt all righty tova grog  noelle oh boy  travis bears first  noelle okay so how far would i have to run to get into the front door  matt to get over here  noelle yeah  matt that would be 30 35 feet would get you right at the front /none/ door there  noelle so if i drag keyleth out of the window could i go through the window am i too big  matt you could go through the window youd lose about ten feet of your movement but youd be able  to get through it youd probably push her out of it  noelle i push her can i pull her laughs i have to push her back in and then go through  marisha im like the golden retriever with the stick  matt if you carry her through thats going to use part of your /none/ actions this turn or you could  just barrel through and push her out whatre you going to do  noelle all right so i can go 45 feet  matt yeah  noelle so if i just bearbarrel through how close could i get to this guy  matt you can get right up next to him  noelle all right im going to do that im going to go for it  matt you rush over and go right past now bear and bear side by side keyleth you get knocked  out of the window prone all /none/ of a sudden this giant werebear impact noise just shoulder checks  you and you go flying out landing on your face on the heated stone sizzling noise ah  sam oh its okay  noelle sorry  marisha its fine i needed a tan i was getting a little pasty  matt take three points of fire damage  groaning  noelle god i would feel worse if your shopping trip hadnt gotten me so much more tortured  yesterday than it should have i dont feel that bad im going to be honest  marisha you legit shouldnt /none/  noelle so now im in is there any way i could get on the other side of him from trinket  matt currently no your full movement gets you right up next to the pit fiend  noelle damn this is a bad plan all right well im just going to hit him with my  matt you have a bonus action too  noelle are my claws only magical when im doing the thing  matt your claws are magical in general  noelle im just going to hit him with my claws then  matt okay  /none/ noelle all right  matt so you take the sword and chuck it aside for a second and bring out your bear claws and  youre going to go for a double strike  noelle 19  matt a 19 to hit  noelle yep  matt 19 misses unfortunately  noelle goddamn it and 25  matt 25 does the first strike goes scraping sound scrapes across the front of the belly of  the pit fiend no damage sustained chuckles deeply you back up with another strike  noelle all right so thats a 14  matt 14 /none/ damage  noelle yeah i guess so  matt all righty and you can use your bonus action to attack a third time if you want to  noelle okay im going to use my bonus action to cast curse of mutual suffering and im going to  amplify that so im going to wait  sam whatre these words  noelle im super special its about to get extra in here so if i do a blood curse and i take  damage does that mean that my werewolf state gets agitated if its selfinflicted  matt if its /none/ selfinflicted no  noelle okay all right im going to amplify it so that means i take 14  matt all righty so go ahead and roll your crimson rite die which i think is a d8 so you  just roll a d8 and you take that much damage  noelle oh right i thought that it was my other one so thats fine thats great i took one  point of damage  matt there you go so you take one point of damage and as far as the mutual suffering all  right there you go so /none/ you watch as you rush up to it you slash it twice with your claws and as  you pick up your sword you put one hand up and as you close your fist you watch as blood pools  in the center of your palm and drips out the corners of your fingers as it does you watch the  veins on the outside of utugashs stomach pulse for a second and his chuckle goes groans like  he got a tummy ache all right that ends your turn  noelle told you i was going to going to /none/ be extra  liam the bear musk over here is palpable  laughter  matt so that finishes tova turn grog  travis ah i want to get in on the melee party may i run up to his opposite side  matt certainly  travis just where his right arm is just so hes got escorts on each end may i smash together my  titanstone knuckles  matt you may  travis its like the autobots  laura yeah it was good  liam sings you got the touch  marisha and liam sings you got the power /none/  matt you transform into your larger self  travis whats up bitch may i make two reckless attacks  matt you may  travis thank you thats a 30  matt that hits  travis 19 nice that is 36  matt 36  travis no that cant be 33  matt 33 damage  travis no i did the second hit  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage for each  travis 18 for the first one these are twohanded by the way 22 for the second one  matt nice so 40 points of damage /none/ on the two strikes as you rush up almost diving into the  pool you skirt off to the side slam the titanstone gauntlets together and grow to your  larger size swirling the axe in the air you go whoosh and the second strike in a big x  formation across the side of it you see it gashing across the arm and the upper muscles of  the shoulder and you see his fingers grip the axe with more anger and frustration  travis oh and this is the thrower its still the dwarven thrower though the hammer /dung/  matt right right the hammer okay  travis can i use my bonus action to go into a frenzied rage  matt you may  travis thanks and i dont get to attack  matt yeah  laura what color is pit fiend blood  matt its a dark dark blackishpurple all righty that ends grog and tovas turn percival  taliesin thats looking really crowded over there im going to wander over to that first  prison cell and take a look inside that door  laura gasps percival  matt okay make a perception check  marisha /none/ percival laughs  laura im standing in the corner looking at him like whispers what are you fucking doing  taliesin yeah a lot 27  matt you glance inside and you can see what appear to be piles of goods small chests boxes  crates it looks like various things that have been collected and just shoved in this corner and  locked up there is a lock on this door  taliesin okay hows my visual on that guy through the window  matt through here  taliesin and i ignore anything other than full cover i ignore /none/ threequarter cover  matt yeah you have visual  taliesin all right im going to take my first shot at that lock  matt you dont have a bonus action well say because you moved up and just glanced inside  taliesin yeah thats fine  matt okay  taliesin ill take my first shot with the pepperbox at that lock  matt the lock okay go for it  taliesin thats 27  matt 27 okay go ahead and roll damage on the lock  taliesin obviously it doesnt take psychic damage thats 16 points of damage  matt /none/ 16 points of damage the lock blasts off and leaves hanging a small piece of twisted  turned metal that once was the top of it the door is now unlocked and open  taliesin cool im going to turn and take my last two shots at orthax ive got a plan  matt utugash  taliesin ive got an orthax plan never mind ive just given the game away  noelle yelling out the wrong name in bed eh  laughter  marisha are you having ptsd flashbacks percival are you okay  taliesin oh man im too tired /none/ im going to mess up my plan this is so bad  liam im totally into you stammering utugash  taliesin first shot im going to take the animus and im going to try for a trick shot for  an arm shot one for grit and just for safetys sake no thats all thats a 31 to hit  matt 31 hits  taliesin and thats ten plus eight plus 1d6 psychic plus im going to burn eight points of  cabals ruin which empties cabals ruin  matt okay  taliesin so thats going to be 14 points /none/ of damage plus one point of psychic damage plus  matt 8d6 lightning  sam oh shnikes  matt cabals ruin man vestiges singsong at your disposal  taliesin five six yeah ill take a seven and an eight ill give these back to you continues  counting 23 points does that seem right  matt 23 points okay  taliesin 23 points of lightning damage and also he has to do a strength check or drop the axe  matt its a 29  taliesin he makes that strength check  laughter  matt he had a natural 19 /none/  taliesin and just for fun ill take one more shot  matt go for it  taliesin thats 31 to hit that hits nothing fancy on this one obviously just the  oldfashioned 16 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage  matt okay nice  taliesin and then im going to use the rest of my turn to if possible open that door and get  behind it for cover of that room  matt okay because you blew the lock off and the doors somewhat ajar well say you move it open  and get /none/ partially inside thats as far as you can get  taliesin i just want to use it for cover  matt all right so you get behind the door and youre ducking in the side there perfect okay  at the end of your turn utugash is going to use a legendary action to attack you  noelle bring it  sam ursa major  noelle thats my wrestling name  matt that is going to be a 16 to hit i think that hits you because you have no armor on  noelle it hits yeah i dont have /none/ no armor on  matt so as the giant axe swings towards you thats going to be 23 points of slashing damage  with the axe however that does trigger the mutual suffering so he takes 23 points of  necrotic damage from the impact as the axe swings and cuts across your bear chest all of sudden  where the blood bulged earlier you watch a secondary wound open simultaneously where no  weapon was apparently visible and blood begins to just trickle out devil blood  travis teach me  laura that was sick  matt and hes /none/ going to use as part of his last legendary action and does another maneuver with  his finger like that  taliesin he did another thing  laura he did another gesture what gesture what did he do  noelle oh fuck  travis same thing  matt he did this  liam gang sign gang sign  laura oh no people are watching  sam was it this thing  matt so at the top of the round the only people in the room right now keyleth is  facefirst on the ground i need tova and grog to /none/ make perception checks if you could  laura what about trinket trinkets got a really good sense of smell  matt have trinket roll a perception check  noelle 17  travis two  laura wait with his keen sense of smell okay 17 plus what does he add to it anything  matt whatever his perception bonus is  laura oh wow 17 plus nine 26  matt trinket doesnt know why but hes like sniffs and you watch trinket looking around the  room the pit fiend is not alone you dont know where anything else is but /none/ while the room appears  to be empty trinket is picking up other scents in the room  noelle can i talk to trinket can i understand trinket  matt laughs sure  laura yes  matt why not your bear form you speak bear  laura yes ah i love this  liam everybody buckle up  matt theres something here  laughter  matt sniffs two small  noelle theres two small  travis why do you sound like a bear  matt you hear the sound of grinding stone you dont see anything unfortunately the low light /none/  in here and your not great perception you dont pick out any visual other than a familiar sound  to you grog as something in the ceiling opens up and suddenly searing hot oil comes spilling  from the ceiling down onto both you trinket and tova i need you to make dexterity saves tova  trinket and grog  laura dont fuck me gil oh gil did he get an advantage though because he sniffed out people  matt nope  laura damn it  travis shouldve gone with gil  matt three  travis seven  laura /none/ nine  matt all right that is 21 points of fire damage to trinket tova and grog  laura 29  matt 21 points of fire damage  sam does he take 21 points of fire damage  travis i am resistant to fire  matt devils have a strange thing called immunity to fire damage  sam immunity not just resistance immunity  matt theyre devils man  travis so im resistant to fire but this is boiling oil does that count  matt its considered fire damage because its the heat that does it so you take half /town/ of that put  you at ten so as thats happening as the oil splashes down you guys are tensing from the  impact vax you peer around the corner and you hear creaking and you look to the other side  just as the portcullis has been lifted and you see coming out of the opposite side the chamber is  one of the bone devils that youve seen wandering in the street and is pouring from the other side  its claws come through its as wide as the hallway its jaw unhinges its tongue slathering  these /none/ small flapping insectlike wings across the back of its scapula its claws  reach out towards you  liam the rest of the party hears ermagerd ermagerd ermagerd  laura did you already ask if the pit fiend took damage because you took damage  noelle oh did he take damage from me was my curse still in effect  matt once he takes the damage the curse is up its just for one hit  noelle sorry i tried my best  matt but he took 23 free damage which is nice vax hes going to take three attacks /none/ on you that  is a 27  liam yeah that kind of hits  matt all right that is a 20  liam that does not hit  matt and with the tail that is a 24  liam that also hits i will use uncanny dodge for the tail  matt okay so the first claw hits you you take 11 points of slashing damage and as the first  claw strikes you across the chest the second one you manage to duck right out of the way it slams  into the stonework and as you glance /none/ up you try and dodge and roll out of the way as the tail  scrapes you across the back that is 18 points of piercing damage reduced to six and you would  have the possibility of becoming poisoned however you guys are still under the effect of  heroes feast so that does not affect you  noelle so his tails poisoned  matt now it is utugashs turn  noelle oh my god that wasnt even his turn  travis that was the turn right  matt utugash stands here with the axe and goes the mouth /none/ not moving you just hear the voice  echoing between your ears its sourceless and in your face now that were all gathered around  theres a flash of red in the eyes and suddenly the ground circling him erupts into flames a wall  of fire is now currently circling the vicinity  travis oh shit  matt this entire column of 20 foot tall flames encircle him and bursts up singeing grog  trinket and tova  laura just singeing  noelle seemed like such a good idea  liam how high is the ceiling in that room /none/  matt its about 25 feet  liam so theres a little space up top  matt a little bit  laura we can see through the fire  matt you cant see through the fire the fire completely obscures your visual of him all you  see is flames and you see the vague shadows of tova grog and trinket now currently engulfed in  them i need you guys to all roll dexterity saving throws  laura natural 20  matt nice  noelle 15  travis god son of a bitch 12  matt all righty everyone /none/ but trinket failed  travis what a 15 and 12 dont make it  matt 23 points of fire damage to grog and tova  travis resistant so i got halved  matt so thats 11 to you and trinket trinket takes 11 currently nobody else has visual range  you have no vision for percy any ranged attacks you cannot see the creature utugash sits there in  the flames surrounding him seemingly not interested in moving at the moment enjoying the  current position  laura how are we going to get him out of those flames man /none/  liam tary you got some kind of dispel magic over there  sam i am so weak  laura dont you have spells you have so many spells  sam you guys want a window somewhere  noelle could you put a window through him  and that would kill him  travis hes real strong  liam all right im going to use my bonus action to cast vow of enmity on the bone devil  matt all righty vow of enmity is in play  liam then im going to use one of my two actions im /none/ using an action to disengage from the bone  devil and dance back past doty  matt dance back past doty all righty  liam and then im going to chuck a goddamn vestige at this motherfucker  matt at the bone devil  liam at advantage oh i rolled the same thing on both 24 to hit  matt that hits  liam okay so hes going to get it right here we go two plus eight is ten plus  sam how tall is the room  matt about 25 feet tall  sam so theres a little /none/ window on top  matt a little four or five foot gap very small  sam okay  taliesin i already like it this is a beautiful glimmer in your eye im excited  sam well its something isnt it  liam 38 and i will smite him as well 52  matt 52 points of damage nice as you throw the dagger as the creature watches you dart past it  streaks out to try and strike at you but youre already gone as you turn around you throw the  dagger it strikes right into the chest of /dung/ the bone devil as it bursts with this dark  grayishwhite light indicative of the raven queens direct impact as it bursts you watch as  part of the flesh tears open showing the dark bluish purple sinew and muscle beneath and the  devil just growls  travis get out of that hallway  liam thats it im done  matt that brings us to vex  laura okay so im going to come up in front of the window  matt okay you glance in and you just see fire and the butt of trinket sticking out of /none/ the fire  laura great  marisha and my feet  matt yeah just up in the air kicking  laura can i hunters mark the pit fiend  matt you cant see it  laura thats fine i know where he was right trinket is facing him so can i try to shoot him  with an arrow anyway  matt ill say you have no visual on him you can go ahead and shoot go for it try it  disadvantage  laura i have sharpshooter i dont know if that helps at all  matt no hes /none/ completely covered  laura okay lets try this out those are being aggressive the lower of the  two rolls was 29  matt okay you watch as you fire your arrow and it disintegrates upon touching the wall of fire  the actual shaft burns as it impacts in the flames  laura okay  noelle you shouldve used your fireproof arrows  laura i know right those fireproof arrows great if i shot an arrow from a blazing bowstring  so it was already a fire arrow you think it would go through  matt give it a /none/ shot  laura okay im going to do that  matt okay so second attack blazing bowstring go ahead and roll with disadvantage  laura 19  matt 19 you go ahead and fire it isnt consumed by the flames but the arrow you hear exit the  other side and then ricochet off the far wall and miss the creatures target  laura well it could have been cool okay trinket is going to use his bonus action to try to  attack him even though hes not magical and hes a little piece of shit  matt all /none/ right go for it  laura that is a 26  matt 26 does hit  laura yeah go trinket  travis come on trink  laura yeah thats good too thats a 15  matt 15 halve that to seven seven points of slashing damage across through the fire still  bravely fighting into it  laura yeah and im going to tell trinket back the fuck out of the fire trinket  matt thats a good plan  laura what are you doing stop attacking get out of the fire  matt backs up and gets out of /none/ the flames backing up against the wall  laura yeah and then im going to back away from the window  matt all right  laura im going to back away from the window  matt where do you want trinket to land by the way  laura just into the corner like where the angle of the wall is  matt over there  laura yeah right there  matt okay  laura and im going to back away from the window to where he doesnt have visual on me  matt you back out of the way of /none/ the window over here  laura yeah  matt okay as trinket backs into that corner i need trinket to go ahead and make a dexterity  saving throw  laura of course  noelle come on trinket come on  laura come on trink  travis noelle and laura aww  laura it almost was really good but it wasnt six  matt a giant cage falls from the ceiling of heated metal and lands on him filled with spikes  and sad bear noises you hear trinket yell from the other side trinket takes seven points of  /none/ piercing damage  laura you did that to an animal  marisha you dont fuck with a rangers bear  matt and six points of fire damage from the heated metal and trinket is currently restrained  has to try and break free to get out  laura youre evil  matt nope utugash is evil there is a definite distinction  travis mr mercer we pulled you over for speeding tonight different voice no i wasnt  speeding tonight the pit fiend was speeding  matt its important guys all righty so that ends your turn vex taryon youre /none/ up  sam jesus  travis fix everything  laura make it better  sam im nobody is it just a cage or is there a door on the bear cage  matt it looks like there is no visible door youd have to tear it off of him  sam thats not going to happen okay our last fight i had hasted myself that was more than a  minute ago though right  matt id say its about halfway done this has all happened pretty quickly because as soon as  the battle started with the cambion that /none/ you guys chased out every round thereafter its still  going so you still have five more rounds of haste  sam okay well then ill go into the place  matt okay you jump over the window keyleth breaks your fall  sam oh sorry its hard to see with my helmet no peripheral vision  matt yeah and you see a column of flame just flickering and burning in the center of the room  occasionally you see a wing tip carve through the top as the creature is moving  within the wall of fire  sam /none/ oh my god  noelle laughs do you have a fire extinguisher  sam no i dont have anything how far can i move hasted  matt double your movement  sam you just double your movement okay so my movements 30 so i can move in there with him  matt if you wanted to yeah  sam okay im just going to go yells and run into the fire  matt you rush into the flames i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw  sam advantage on dexterity saves oh all right no thats nine  /none/ matt 30 points of fire damage  sam halved  matt halved because of  sam my helm of brilliance  matt thats true there you go so 15 points of fire damage to you taryon as you rush through  youre like hah the fire was enough and you sit there and look right up on this massive like  swollen devilish entity with giant red leathery wings lower jaw with hooked tusks that stick out  the bottom gleaming yellow piercing eyes giant horns that curl up from the brow a giant axe in  one hand and /none/ the other hand just points at you and goes hi in the center of your head  sam im just going to say hi its a little warm in here here cool off  and ill throw acid on him  laughter  matt all right go ahead and make the attack  sam i dont know what im rolling 14 this is to hit its magic i dont know  how does this work  matt well no hold on  sam its a vial of acid  matt im going to pull up your class here just to /none/ check it out  sam i never know if this is a spell attack bonus sort of a thing  matt when you throw it they have to make a saving throw so whats your dc  sam the dc of the spell is 17  matt 17 okay and it requires a saving throw because its the acid  laura i like how the music stopped while we figure this out  matt its dexterity okay that is 17  sam so he resists it completely  matt creature must succeed or take yeah he resists it entirely  /none/ laura balls  matt yeah sorry  sam no problem  matt so as you throw it it hits the edge of the horn and just shatters and breaks behind it  sam oh all right i think i get a bonus still maybe  matt you do have a bonus  sam i will cast sanctuary on myself  matt what you do is you have an extra attack as haste you get your action  sam okay that was my action  matt that was your action you have another action to do a melee attack if you /none/ want to  sam ooh okay i will stab him with my lance  matt okay go for it roll for an attack so yeah as hasted you get the additional attack  sam ooh thats going to hit its a 25  matt that hits actually go ahead and roll the damage and it is a magical weapon so hes not  resistant to it  travis what sound do you make when you hit him  sam highpitched grunt  laughter  sam like a breathy grunts  travis work on your war face  sam thats 1d12 /none/ thank you very much thats seven  laura do you add anything to it  sam no wait i get a plus six ooh and it was a six thats 13  matt is that fire damage  sam no the fire damage is another plus one but i dont think youll be adding that  matt no  sam laughs yeah so 13  matt 13 points of damage against the pit fiend as you stab it and you can cast sanctuary on yourself  as your bonus  sam i will and as i do that i also /none/ say doty remember how i said back up grog me back up me  laughter  matt as doty charges forward and rushes in i need doty to make a dexterity saving throw  sam oh no 16 plus whats his dexterity zero so 16  matt doty takes 30 points of fire damage  sam groans hes unconscious  marisha already  sam i dont know when the last time we rested was but i have down that he only has 30 hit points  left did he take damage at some point  matt well because he hurt /none/ himself going through the metal outside so doty comes  rushing in and goes impact sound and just collapses on the ground next to you superheated  sizzling noise  sam oh no is he going to melt  matt you dont think so  sam hes in the fire right  matt hes in the fire yeah  sam oh god is he making some sort of window that someone else could walk over  matt no the flames curl around sorry all right so that ends taryons turn  sam good im glad i used that last little /none/ thing  laughter  sam killed my best friend  laura tary its your only friend  matt at the end of the turn the pit fiend sticks a hand out of the flames and does this motion  make a perception check again grog  travis not a problem  matt and tova both you guys  travis 14  liam tova fire  noelle a 17  matt 17 okay still not quite noticing anything but youre starting to notice that there are these  small inset stone circles on the wall behind him over in this area /none/ and you watch as two of them go  stone grinding and get pressed in by themselves  travis into the wall or out from the wall  matt into the wall like something just pressed this giant circular stone button separately  travis were in an engine  matt so vax where you are the floor you hear a click like something releasing i need you to  make a dexterity saving throw  liam oh well im good im fine im at advantage hopefully thats good not that good  laura oh my god can you use luck /none/  liam no hold on this is dexterity  travis it might be balloon animals dont sweat it yet  liam oh man its not great its 16  laura use luck  liam i think i have one left i think i have one left so im going to use it  matt all right go for it  liam oh thats better that is 25  matt 25 is enough the ground suddenly hinges out from under you and you leap up and jam your  blades into each side of the wall and put your foot out /none/ to the side and its almost not enough  to press into the small space but you just barely catch yourself van dammestyle on each side the  bone demon across from you its wings flare up as the ground tumbles out from under you you see  about ten feet below you a pool of molten iron that is just burbling it stays open swinging  for a few seconds before it closes once more beneath you  liam good to know  marisha im really glad you used that luck  travis how do you know its not /none/ molten steel kidding  matt one way to find out that brings us to keyleth  marisha oh jeez okay i roll over  matt you stand up and see trinket currently trapped in the cage next to you just whining  sad bear whimpers  marisha its okay buddy just hang on tsunami coming though look out im going to do a tidal  wave and go bwoosh do you have the laser pointer what are these red pools of things  laura thats molten blood he said  marisha its molten blood  matt all right so youre /none/ doing tidal wave  marisha i want to try and avoid my friends its tenfootwide  travis if youve got to you know who to aim it at  marisha in fact theres a tenfoot gap right matt between everybody right up front  matt right up front theres a little bit of a gap there and doty is on the ground  you can step on doty  marisha its ten foot right can i do my tidal wave from this direction backwards  matt how wide is the tidal wave  marisha ten feet  matt its still /none/ going to hit somebody  marisha whos it going to hit  matt theres five feet between taryon and tova and  travis either me or taryon i mean doty or whoever  marisha i know grog is dextrous so grog can take it sorry grog but i want to start here and go  backwards towards you  matt towards me so this way okay youre choosing taryon  marisha no grog to get hit  matt so this way  marisha yeah its a tenfootwide column that i just want to go back  matt right in order /none/ for it to hit the pit fiend its going to hit either taryon  marisha or grog  matt no because grogs far off to the side if it comes back this way  its just going to hit grog  marisha sorry i was confused when you said grog so whos it going to hit  matt its going to hit either taryon or its going to have to hit tova and doty  noelle do what youve got to do  marisha tova  noelle sorry i pushed you out a window  laughter  matt i need /none/ tova to make a dexterity saving throw  marisha only because i think shes more dextrous than him  noelle that is 11  matt what is it  noelle 11  matt thats not going to work for a spell dc however utugash does not make the save either  with a roll of a six plus eight that is a 14 so thats 4d8 bludgeoning damage  go ahead and roll that  sam oh man kill our own guest  marisha no its not that much five six seven ten and a reroll i do an eight /none/ so  thats eight 23 damage thank you  matt okay  marisha and he should be knocked prone  sam thats not a seven  marisha no its an eight wait five seven thats 10 18 18 damage  matt okay  marisha and hes knocked prone  matt as is tova  marisha and then the water spreads across the ground in all directions and extinguishes  unprotected flames in an area within 30 feet of it  matt correct  marisha thats all i cared about mainly  matt so the water whoosh and the wall of /none/ fire in that one section sputtering fire roaring back  to life unfortunately the enchantment continues to produce flames once the spell disseminates the  water the nature of the spell is it perpetually conjures fire so there is a brief moment where  it causes a gap and the flames pick up once more he is knocked prone he took damage  marisha okay i tried sorry guys  matt are you going to move or are you going to stay where you are keyleth  marisha im going to back up as can i crawl do i have /none/ enough movement to crawl back through the  window  matt you do  marisha ill do that  matt so you go back there and you can move right back around  marisha yeah i want to keep it use it as like cover  matt okay that ends keyleths turn tova grog  noelle took some damage little bit but im prone  matt so you can get up and use half your movement  noelle okay ive got to make a wisdom saving throw to not attack anyone  matt are you under half health  noelle /none/ yes i am oh i actually did it okay its fine dont worry  false alarm everythings fine  matt so you maintain control  noelle dont worry about it well deal with it later when it comes up  sam what wouldve happened to me  noelle no everythings fine were good so if i stand up that takes half my turn  matt half your movement  noelle okay well im going to stand up  matt youre still in the flames currently  noelle well thats not good  matt you can take your turn and then /none/ back out of the flames if you wanted to  noelle im going to use my crimson rite to light up my claws  matt with what type of  noelle with frozen does that help me with fire at all can i bat the flames  away with my icy paws  matt your hands feel more comfortable  noelle okay  laughter  matt where once was these giant bear claws you watch as mystic ice gathers around them turning  into longer razors that extend from your regular claws  noelle all right im going to come /none/ to this guy and  laura eat it utugash  noelle my claw attacks with the rite does that increase  matt not to hit but it does an additional 1d8 cold damage per strike  noelle all right thats a 26  matt that hits  laura do you get advantage because hes prone  matt you do get advantage because hes prone  noelle 24  matt that hits  the third attack if you want to use your bonus you already used your bonus you only get  two both hit roll damage  noelle all right /none/ that is a 13 and thats a 15  matt add 2d8 cold damage to that as well because of your crimson rite  noelle 2d8 can i use my great weapon to reroll my one here  matt yeah  noelle that is a four and a five so nine  matt nice thats a total of 37 points of damage in two strikes  do you want to back out of the flames  noelle yeah thatd be good  matt you can get that far out of the way you back up just out of the fire /none/ look over and  theres another bear chained in that place that ends your turn grog  travis osh kosh magosh its time for hammers can i advance through the  ring of fire and on him more  matt unfortunately because of both of your sizes you cannot advance into the ring he takes  up too much space youre either standing right in the middle of the ring and just taking it or  youre going to have to back out of it  laura what if you jump on him  matt you can try if you /none/ want to  laura you could jump on him  travis thats not actually a terrible idea because at the worst i just fall off one side or  the other into the boiling blood ill just stay in the ring of fire i dont want to test the  sriracha pit just yet because hes prone do i get advantage on the attacks  without having to use reckless  matt correct  travis can i make all three of my frenzied attacks  matt you may  travis with advantage 35 for the first one  matt that /none/ hits  travis which is ten 20 26  matt that hits  travis nice thats 29  matt yeah  travis ten 26

you are  travis yeah theyre really strong hits because im burning while im doing it literally whaling  through the fire and just angry  matt make your dexterity saving throw  travis advantage on that that sucks thats a seven i have resistance to /none/ fire its okay  matt 28 points of fire damage reduced to half 14  travis 14 thank you  matt all right that ends grogs turn percival  taliesin if hes prone does that mean that negates the difficulty to hit through the ring  matt well ranged attacks against prone creatures have disadvantage naturally and you cant even  see him you have no visual range you dont even know that hes prone  taliesin so thats a mess  matt yeah  travis i still have my movement can i move out of the ring  matt /none/ i was asking if you wanted to do that or not  travis oh i would like to after all the smashing is done  matt you move out and do not take the last bit of fire damage you take that when you end your turn  in the fire how far do you back up just out of the range  travis just on the cusp of it  matt you step out of it  laura not to the other corner where theres probably  travis probably not  taliesin yeah i think i can see that /none/ vax is having a little bit of a problem  matt you can glance to the side yeah  taliesin theres a window in the door im going to swing around the other side of that door really  quickly perch on the wall right over there and im going to take a couple shots at  mr skelly skellington  matt go for it  sam youre not just in the closet over there sorting through file cabinets  taliesin no i was tempted to see if it was anything weve got him on tax evasion  laughter  /none/ i was hoping we would find a person in there ill keep digging okay so first shot im  going to burn a grit for a torso push  matt okay  taliesin actually im going to add hex to that just for fun im going to hex him  matt okay cool  taliesin thats 23 to hit  matt 23 hits  taliesin thats 14 points of damage two points of psychic damage and five points of necrotic he  also has disadvantage on constitution checks and hes pushed ten feet back  matt slams up against the /none/ wall there  taliesin im going to shoot him two more times  travis is the portcullis closed behind you  matt the portcullis is currently closed as soon as he pushed through it  taliesin second shot im going to burn one more grit and im going to try for a head shot which  will give him disadvantage on next rounds attacks  matt okay  taliesin 24 to hit  matt 24 hits  taliesin thats 11 points of normal damage five points of psychic damage and two points of  necrotic piercing damage he has to /none/ save against a constitution saving throw against 20  matt that is a 16  taliesin he has disadvantage on all of his physical attacks for the next round  matt okay cool  taliesin one more shot for fun and lets make this a sharpshooter  matt sure  taliesin that was not my wisest thing ever 16  matt 16 does not hit unfortunately  taliesin oh well  liam i dont think vax has ever had one of percivals bullets go right by his ear  it is unsettling  taliesin im going to flip back around /none/ on the other side of that im going to spider crawl all  the way on the other side of that door again  matt all right that ends your turn at the end of percivals turn there is a grinding sound  above grog i need you to make another dexterity saving throw  travis come on gil 18  laura no  sam is it big enough to cover his big body  travis its just like a spiked helmet stabbing me in the cheek  matt it gets around your upper torso and sticks partway on and /none/ your arms are click to the side  it tears into you you take 14 points of piercing damage reduced to seven and then six points of  fire damage reduced to three you are restrained  travis

whats your ac  liam hasted with both daggers out its 23  matt with the tail it is 19 all three miss  sam why does he have disadvantage  taliesin i /none/ shot him in the face  matt yeah one of the eyes got blasted on the side part of the skull is broken and destroyed  taliesin that happens when i breathe for a second before i shoot  matt at this point in time  laura oh no hes pulling things out  liam more miniatures  matt two more devil characters come through the portcullis rises as they pass through and they go  into a full run into this chamber you see these redskinned devil humanoids rush in with these  long jagged spears horned crests on /none/ their head and from where their chins are there are these  writhing tentacles covered in thorns and barbs that move and twist around  travis what sweet hell did your imagination come from  matt full movement with the double dash that guy will get there this guy will get about there  thats as far as they can get not fully up to anybody yet all right we have utugash stands up  in the flames and looks down at taryon darrington  sam good day to you sir do you know my father  matt you hear /none/ the voice echo in the center of your mind good day and good night its going  to make a full round of attacks on you  sam oh boy  matt so that is 30 to hit  sam yeah of course doty will save nope  matt as he leans forward and takes a big chunk with his bite out of the front of your tries to  get to the helmet and the jaw sticks under the chin thats going to be 24 points of piercing damage  however you are immune to poison so you dont /none/ have to worry about his poison right now thanks to  your so the helmet catches most of the brunt of it and one of the teeth jabs you right underneath  the jaw and you can feel it pierce and begin to bleed from underneath as soon as he pulls back  and shoves you aside and releases its grip as its claw strikes out from its left arm  that is a 16 to hit  sam because im hasted that does

nice as the beam pssh across the room it streaks down the way and both  of them get engulfed as the beam of bright sunlight energy slowly diminishes their faces are  seared you see smoke pouring out of their eyes as theyre both reaching up to the sockets that was  not so good for them theyre both looking pretty rough already  marisha i look at tary tary is within 30 feet /none/ of me yeah  matt you dont see tary you just see a column of fire  marisha i dont see tary  matt tary is currently inside the wall of fire curled in a ball all you see is a giant column of  flame in the center of the room and half of doty being slowly heated up  marisha do i see anyone else and does anyone else look rough  matt you see grog with a giant cage on his upper body wrapping around his torso  travis just spinning in place confused screams  laughter /none/  noelle im down to 39 hit points  marisha do i see tova  matt you do see tova yeah  marisha okay i say hey sorry about the whole tsunami thing you got this and i give her a  healing word at level one im going to give you shit plus my spell modifier  sorry nine hit points  liam fixed  noelle all better now  matt hey it helps it all helps trust me it helps all right keyleth are you going to stay  where you are  marisha yeah  matt all /none/ right keyleth stays there tova and grog youre up  noelle so two questions and one of them is is my rite still on  matt yes it is your rite stays on until you dismiss it  noelle all right my question also is are these cages still would it hurt me to  touch one or move one  matt i mean theyre pretty warm to touch  noelle my hands are very cool  matt you know what actually with your claws out i would say they will do no damage to you  because the cold /none/ will offset that  noelle all right so let me know if this sounds doable i want to grab that cage that  trinket was under  matt okay  noelle and move it towards where utugash is tary is in the fire yeah  matt yes  noelle can i grab him and pull him back with me behind this cage  matt hes about 25 feet from you you dont even know where he is you know that hes inside the  fire but you dont see him because youre outside the flames all you see is a /none/ wall of fire  you have to step into the fire take the fire damage grab him and pull him back  noelle can i just reach laughs my cold bear hand into the fire and grab him and pull him out  matt youll still take the fire damage from the wall of fire unfortunately  noelle can i get decreased fire damage  matt its probably not going to work out its magical fire im sorry but the cage is nearby  you are closer to the cage than you are him so if you want to grab /none/ the cage and move towards him you  can do that is that what you want to do  noelle let me can i grab this cage and put it between this cage is just sitting out got to do  something can i throw the cage at that guy whos standing there hes there right  matt you can go ahead and make a strength check you have advantage because  you are in your bear form  noelle laughs that is a 14  matt 14 is fine thats enough  noelle no wait 13 what  laura /none/ didnt you roll an eight  liam plus your strength of ten so 18  noelle oh yeah bears are great at math  matt sorry this would be an athletics check to lift it not strength sorry  noelle okay then yeah 18  matt so you reach over and you grab it and the steam rises up the sides of the cage and you lift  it up over your head and youre going to go and try to throw it over at this guy there so as you  lift the cage go ahead and roll for /none/ just accuracy on this roll an attack add your proficiency  what did you roll oh no you throw the cage and it rolls into the center of the hallway there  blocking the doorway ah those ones are the worst  noelle i know  travis laughs that dice sucks  noelle i know yeah  laura you seriously need to stop using that one  noelle what else can i do  matt you still have your movement and your bonus if you wanted to do  sam do you have healing potions  matt you still have /none/ your blood maladict if you wanted to use any of it  noelle all my stuff is probably in that prison that percy was in i dont have any pockets  laughter  sam oh yeah  noelle yeah i was sort of unprepared for this i was really excited for this fight  marisha tiny pockets this is a problem of womens fashion to be fair  noelle i know even with the bears  marisha why tiny pockets  noelle i know  marisha come on womens fashion come on  noelle so i have my bonus action /none/  matt you do  laura what is a blood maladict  liam really cool words on the sheet  noelle i know not as helpful as i had hoped i can see an objects history  matt grog what are you doing while she is figuring this out  travis im going to try and get out of the cage  matt all right go ahead and make a strength skill check  travis i have advantage on those  matt yes you do  laura grog voice i have advantage ooh thats good  travis and laura thats /none/ better  travis 27  matt 27 as you tense the metal actually creaks and bends out the sides and you just tear  the cage off of the top of you thats your action  laura thats your whole action  travis yep  matt yep  travis yep  taliesin youve got bonuses and stuff though  matt you do you have your bonus action if youre still raging so  travis yeah i do  liam waking up  travis im going to throw oh i just see a column of

like to visit him please  matt you turn around and hes right there currently with his eyes smoking from being seared  with a sunbeam  travis hi smash  matt okay hes blinded so you have advantage automatically  travis yay natural 20  laura oh can you imagine if you had been attacking the pit fiend /none/  travis yeah i know  taliesin smear him  travis thats 24 thats two additional damage die  taleisin like a fat mosquito  travis 30  matt 30 points of damage  travis yeah they were all three really lowdamage die rolls oh actually i can reroll a  one or a two which was that last one nine thats better  sam doesnt matter you killed him  marisha doesnt matter hes dead hes so dead  matt as you turn around and see him there you go hi wham hes going hisses and hears this  /none/ hi and his entire head collapses inward and you shove it down to about the height of the rest of  his shoulders he just wet collapsing noises to the ground and just crumples and then burns into  ash and just cinders left behind destroyed  travis cool huh  matt thats beautiful is what it is ending grogs turn percival youre up  noelle wait can i take my last thing  matt oh yeah thats right whatre you going to do with your bonus  noelle all right so i can only move or i can only /none/ use my bonus action yeah  matt correct yeah  noelle okay well im just going to cast curse of mutual suffering on utugash one more time  matt you currently do not have visual range on him you cant see him does it say for the  curse that you need to be able to see the creature thats the question let me look  noelle it just says a creature within 30 feet  matt so yeah so you just know where they are so you can curse of mutual suffering does hit  utugash are you going /none/ to amplify it or not  noelle am i going to what  matt amplify it or leave it as it is  noelle yeah im going to amplify it  matt go ahead and roll your d8 and take d8 damage  noelle all right im just going to oh six that is six for me  matt all righty  noelle and then im going to throw my bear arms wide and just like  matt laughs come at me bro  laughter  noelle sup asshole  matt perfect all righty  percival youre up  taliesin /none/ all right im going to reload because boy im out  laura and travis bubble throat  taliesin yeah no thats right i was like what what bubble yeah gravelly mumbling got  a little thing i didnt know it had a name and now its the obvious name for it its bubble  throat im going to swing back around and back up a little bit and im going to take three more  potshots at that bone because thats what i can see  matt all righty  taliesin im not going to get close to him im /none/ going to back up a bit just back up in the middle  of the room im going to keep going  matt about there sure go for it and take your attacks  taliesin nothing fancy attack number one thats 26 to hit and thats nine points of piercing  damage five points of necrotic damage and two points of psychic damage  matt vax as youre looking across the room you see the bone devil hisses and it rears back  and the wings span out it looks like hes about to leap and as it takes its /dung/ jump you watch  its face explode forward with dark crimson just mist as the head is blown off of its shoulders  marisha get that grit back  taliesin better and im going to see if i can is there anything ive got two more shots  matt there is one creature in here that you can barely see through the side  taliesin oh i can oh all right lets do that thats funny another shot at that guy  laura it is really hard to see some of these people  taliesin 23  matt red creatures /dung/ on dark red sorry  taliesin 23  matt 23 hits  taliesin oh and thats right i dont have that anymore the hex isnt until next turn where i can  move it thats 15 points of damage plus one point of psychic damage  matt okay still standing but its looking rough you have advantage on these attacks by the  way because its blinded  taliesin oh all right and then im going to take another shot im going to make this a  sharpshooter just to end this yeah thatll do thats 14 20 25  /none/ matt yep go ahead and roll damage  taliesin i didnt know i had advantage thats lovely thats 18 19 20 21 25 points of damage  and four points of psychic damage  matt so after the cage goes flying over his head and clangs behind it it spins around as it hears  the impact and turns back in the direction of tova even though its eyes are currently held shut  from the blinding light of the sunbeam it rears back with its hooked pull arm and is about to rush  towards the torso of tova /none/ knowing and being able to sense where she is right as it rears back  gunshots two shots the second one knocking its head limply across the back of its shoulders and  it tumbles to the ground unmoving  marisha you get another grit back  taliesin i get another grit back  travis get another grit back  marisha get that grit back  matt is that the end of your turn percy  taliesin that is other than just backing up a little bit more as far as i can go just to get  out of /none/ the  matt laughs just getting away from everything  taliesin getting away from everything  matt ah ah okay perfect  taliesin im good at a distance  matt okay so this is on utugashs turn utugash is going to strike with a bite against taryon  darrington  sam sure  matt frustratingly thats going to be oh it has to make a wisdom save doesnt it  sam it does  matt for that first attack thats a natural 20  laura oh my god  matt better that than for the attack but after that the /none/ first attack was a 18 to hit  sam hits  matt all righty as it chomps down onto your torso this time as opposed to going for the  helmet it goes for the side of the shoulder its mouth is large enough to go over your shoulder and  come in both the chest and the back of the shoulder as it sinks in that is going to be 24  points of piercing damage and youre immune to poison so you dont take that  youre still standing  sam yes  matt all righty  sam /none/ well crouching  matt right  marisha in the fetal position  matt as its clamped down on you it takes its claw and rakes across your stomach  sam technically it has to roll another wisdom save it lasts for a minute  its not per attack actually  matt it does youre right that is a ten plus ten that is 20  sam he succeeds  matt okay the attack roll for that one was a 21  sam yes  matt so for the claw raking across your torso that is going to be 21 points /none/ of slashing damage  sam strangled death noises  laura oh no tary  matt and with that taryon falls unconscious and bleeding on the ground  travis tary jumbo  matt utugash after the claws tear across part of the plate armor swings open and the claw rakes  through the side of the torso leaving the wounds open and bleeding out and steaming across the  heavy heated stonework of the room  sam and at that point do all of their necklaces glow  matt they do they begin to pulse  marisha thats totally correct yeah /none/  noelle whats going on  travis ive no idea what this means  marisha someones unconscious and we cant tell that theyre unconscious  matt at this point utugash is going to use his the wings take flight at this point as nothing is  immediately in the circle and hes getting frustrated by this the wings pick him up in the  air hes going to peek through the top of the form and look over and he sees tova and keyleth  and is going to land technically on your guys spaces this is part of his /none/ corpulent form  ability i need you both to make dexterity saving throws  noelle finally thank you that is an 18  marisha thats not great saving dex 14  matt all right you both suffer 17 points of bludgeoning damage as utugashs giant form lands  on top of you you are pinned to the ground you are considered grappled and prone as utugash is  currently now  noelle so utugash also maybe takes some damage from that  matt yeah well takes the same 17 points of damage from the mutual suffering  noelle thats something /none/  matt so youre both prone and considered grappled you cannot move until you  get out of the grapple  marisha were both grappled  matt yeah because hes basically sitting on top of you  marisha fucking dick  matt i need you to make a concentration saving throw to maintain sunbeam  marisha i have advantage on that  matt you do  marisha ill take that 18  taliesin yeah  marisha yeah i just have to beat the damage correct 18  matt its either ten or half of the damage so youre fine with /none/ you both pinned you at  immediate visual perspective look the most vulnerable to utugash as you are a tiny halfelf  girl as far as hes concerned hes going to use his next two attacks the axe and the tail with  advantage against you because you are currently knocked prone  marisha aw desu desu  matt the axe is going to be a 32 to hit  marisha what 32  matt 32 to hit  marisha i mean yeah  matt 25 points of slashing damage  marisha 17 plus 20 plus 23  laura what /none/ are you doing concentration on  marisha my sunbeam  laura oh right  matt so thats 23 points of slashing damage plus 23 points of fire damage so a total of 46  marisha can i use my reaction to cast absorb elements  matt if you have it prepared yeah  marisha yes i do  matt which allows you to  marisha never done this before let me doublecheck i capture some of the energy and i  store it and i have resistance to the next damage type that i take that and the first time /none/ i hit  with a melee attack on my next turn i can do an extra 1d6 of that damage type  matt so you take 11 points of fire damage instead  marisha beautiful  matt so it does 34 points of damage total  marisha so another 11 wouldve made it 82 okay i have to beat a ten correct  matt no you have beat half of the 34 which would be 17 so you have to beat a 17  marisha nope wait what do i add  matt your constitution saving throw  marisha oh /none/ no im good then im good thats exactly a 17  matt okay then thats fine you succeed and then the tails going to slam down onto you as  well keyleth with advantage on that 16 natural 20  marisha what  travis matthew  matt natural 20  laura but wait what did the next melee attack do to you  matt this is the tail  marisha its me attacking  matt its a nine a ten and a seven on 3d10 so that is  travis oh god  matt 62 points of bludgeoning damage  /none/ marisha 60 wait how  sam halved  marisha halved is it halved wait what  matt marisha and sam no  marisha its not  sam i just like saying that  matt well sorry its 20 it was 52 points because it was a ten a nine and a seven so it  wouldve been 26 just the dice crit is 52 plus ten 62 62 points  marisha i mean im still up  sam hey thats good  marisha with 20 hit points no i was at 82 minus 62 which means  laura 20 points /none/  marisha 20 points  noelle so seeing as he like landed on me could i do anything here any reaction  matt do you have a reaction to do  noelle i dont know laughs  matt no not really youre just like urgh youre being sat on by the pit fiend  noelle even if i was upright be like a pincushion to sit on  matt i mean youre holding it off but his heavy hide against your pincushiontype nails is not  going to do much unless youre physically attacking behind it  noelle icicles  /none/ matt i know and hes resistant to cold sorry  noelle just thought id check  matt vax  liam all right well my enemy is gone percival just shot it through the face so i start to fly  towards the entrance the moment i come through and i see keyleth mangled on the ground  underneath i just react and fly straight at the thing and snag onto his chest like an angry  pissedoff cat and i just start slicing  matt okay go for it  liam im actually going to bonus action hunters mark him /none/ as i land im going to move the hunters  mark excuse me from the slain guy  matt okay  liam yep and okay and here we go that is shit no well its 16 im sure it doesnt hit  matt 16 does not hit no  liam okay that is 19  matt 19 does not hit either both angry strikes just hit the hide but its too strong and the  devilish scales deflecting the piercing blows  liam im going to stay hanging on  matt okay vex youre up  laura okay hey i /none/ can see him now  matt you can its also sitting currently on tova and keyleth keyleth is looking pretty banged  up tovas looking pretty banged up and your brother is hacking at it to no avail  laura i dont know what all i could see of that other than just the pit fiends arm through the  window but im going to back up and shoot him im going to hunters mark him first though  matt okay  laura and im going to yeah thats what im going to do  matt okay as you back /none/ up he does get a reaction attack of opportunity because he has a reach  laura through the window  matt yeah as you back up the tail after smashing at keyleth goes whoosh and whips through the  window towards you thats going to be a 25 to hit  laura yeah sure whatever  matt that is 21 points of bludgeoning damage against you  laura great  matt the tail almost sends you off your feet almost knocking the wind out of you from the  impact to your chest and stomach area but you slide and /none/ catch yourself before  tumbling backward  laura sighs i hate you hunters mark  travis why do you need hunters mark  laura well you know  liam i think this is going to be a negative but a quick clarification question with them on the  ground then theres no flanking bonus or anything  matt nope they are not threatening him currently  liam thats what i thought checking  matt they have to be threatening them to be giving that bonus  travis tickle  matt laughs they are currently under his rump  laura the /none/ first one is a one  sam yay  matt the impact from the chest blow ends up as you go to grab the arrow youre already kind of a  little offaim from the the wooziness  laura grunts in pain all right thats fine im going to hit him again though or try that  is i can add 23  matt 23 hits  laura yes okay yes 18 plus one lightning damage plus 2d6 here we go and two ones im  rolling great woo  noelle want to borrow some dice  laura all of /none/ these all of you guys are goodbyes and youre a goodbye too you can stay  matt all right so how much damage was that total  laura huh how much was that  matt yeah  laura oh 19 total one of those was lightning damage  matt okay good so the second arrow does hit and youre seeing now utugash while looming over  and seemingly impervious at close view as you get a glance backing up is looking pretty hurt  previously as its now your second time battling a pit fiend youre able to see the /none/ faint cracks  that youre beginning to notice generally show a lot more damage than they do on the surface so  youre starting to see signs of wear which based on your previous battle leads you to believe its  actually pretty hurt that ends your turn vax and vex  laura im going to back up i can use the rest of my movement right  matt you can yeah  laura and back up around that corner so im parallel with percy there yeah right there  matt okay cool that brings us to taryon i need /none/ you to roll a death saving throw  sam oh sure yeah can i feel lucky  matt you can technically  sam oh thats worse  laughter  matt so thats one failed death saving throw on tary  noelle tary  laura i just have a quick question  matt yeah  laura since i i havent used this very much the disengage feat that the rogues have is that a  bonus action  matt its a bonus action to disengage yeah  laura okay just checking  matt yeah youd already moved your hunters mark unfortunately /none/ but going forward  you can do that  liam its a zigzag motion  travis serpentine  matt now  travis now what  noelle dont press any more buttons  matt two imps that were previously invisible in the room and hitting the various buttons across  the back wall at his command  laura oh it was those fucks  matt appear and both fly down swinging towards keyleth whos currently pinned underneath and  are just going to begin to start attempting to bite at her or these are the stings so with  advantage that /none/ is six plus five that is 11 the first one the stinger hits you it just cant  pierce the armor the second one is going to go ahead and with advantage that is a 13 just  cant pierce the armor little imps theyre like snarls and utugash is like ugh hungry  carrion wraiths that brings us to keyleth  marisha sighs okay time to go big i am going to cast shapechange my 9thlevel spell and i am  going to turn into a fire giant  laura a fire giant  marisha yeah so as im /none/ down my eyes light up and i start to turn into a giant and i want to  reach up and grab him by the throat and try and stand up and see if i can piledrive him  matt okay go ahead and roll your attack for your fire giant  liam im going for a ride  laura are you attached to him  travis are you super strong  marisha i am is this plus 11 just to my attacks  matt everyone else gets pushed out of the way so yes  marisha natural 20  /none/ cheering  marisha thanks gil  laura that made up for all the rest of the times he fucked us during this game  matt so tova and the imps get pushed aside as keyleths form suddenly encompasses most of the  corner of the room natural 20 you grab utugash by the throat grab the torso lift him up slam  him onto the ground go ahead and roll just the basic damage for the fire elementals attack it  doesnt knock him prone but this is the flavor for the attack  marisha how do you know what /none/ basic damage is  matt look for the attack for the fire giant  marisha well it just gives me multiattack  matt and underneath that it says  marisha and it gives me a greatsword melee attack  matt yeah just roll the damage for the greatsword the attack is  the flavor of the strike  marisha that is 6d6 that is one two three four i need one more  liam im on this guys chest by the way and he goes down and its landing on the ground i love  what you do  laughter /none/  liam and i want to somersault away  marisha ten 16 24 damage  matt how much did you roll  marisha 24  travis 24  matt 24 that was with the double  marisha right so doubled that so 48 damage  matt plus seven  marisha plus seven yeah  matt yeah so that is 55 points of damage  marisha grunts  laura just say it i want to hear you say it  matt well its not there yet  groaning  matt technically your action was to cast the spell and you wouldnt /none/ have the ability to attack  in the same round but im letting you do it because why not because its fun  marisha well i didnt move  matt its fine  laughter  matt and well say you cant move this turn but it was fun it was cool why not all right that  ends your turn keyleth  marisha yeah  matt tova grog  noelle all right lets just go all out here im going to cast  matt its looking really rough by the way  noelle  blood curse of the marked on /none/ utugash im going to amplify it  matt all righty  noelle four four damage for me and then im going to slide in under this fire giants legs and  go for it with my claws and the crimson rite  matt all righty so at half movement thats five ten 15 20 you can just get into combat  range right there knocking vax over and killing him  all chanting tova tova tova  noelle all right so thats a 28 to hit on one  matt that hits  noelle and that is a 24 to /none/ hit on the second  matt that hits  laura that dies so much better  noelle all right so that is 11 that is a 13 and i get two more yeah matt  with my crimson rite  matt with the claws you do 2d8 and these are doubled because you did your mark  noelle okay  matt so what did you roll  noelle a seven seven for the 2d8 and then what did i say 13 and 11 the first time  matt yes so its 13 and 11 for the actual weapon damage for /none/ the claws and then now what  did you roll for the first  noelle seven together  matt seven together so thats 14  how do you want to do this  cheering  matt two guests in a row all right so how do you want to do that as you watch the fire giant  clutching it by the throat and slamming it onto the ground utugash is in this sort of wrestling  ring encounter in the center of the room  noelle just going to fucking body slam him with my bear body and going /none/ to hit him with both my  claws going to tear his fucking throat out  travis yeah yeah  noelle and im going to look down at him and im going to be like  how do you like me now asshole  matt so keyleth in the impressive moment of slamming utugash down the grip you have on the  throat is loosened suddenly as a secondary force pushes utugash out of your grip what looks to be  a bowling ball of a furlike bear form goes slamming into the torso of the devil who then  /none/ falls onto the back as the bear just begins wolverine berserker barraging tearing through the  chest and torso cavity of the devil drops the axe and is trying to reach up and is clawing at  your back and tearing through flesh you can feel the blood but youre too focused at this point  the frenzy kicking in from your transformation and as you stare down and say that into his face  utugashs tongue is lolling back across the tusks and says well still find you and just goes  limp across the ground  noelle deep /none/ exhale  marisha i stand up and i look at grog and in giant i say sup  travis sup playa  marisha whats up man  travis damn you be talkin my lingo  marisha yeah  noelle im going to spit on him while im still standing and im just going to flop on my back  turn back into a dwarf be like hey you guys want to get a beer  taliesin arent there still two  matt there are two imps in the chamber but they both turn invisible as soon as this happens and /none/  theyre attempting to escape as the flame wall disappears and you see taryon bleeding out on the  ground next to his superheated  liam oh i land and lay on hands  matt okay yeah youre close enough to do so  liam okay ill give him ten  matt okay  travis maybe we just toss him in the blood  matt so how much do you give him  liam ten  matt ten so you have ten hit points and you come to consciousness  sam oh i had the craziest dream  liam slap /none/  sam oh  liam are you all right are you really all right are you having fun  sam did i kill it again  liam stonecold dead you did congratulations  matt i will say keyleth  marisha yeah  matt because technically they were in melee range with you since you pushed them out of the way as  they vanish you do get one attack of opportunity across them with disadvantage  marisha ooh am i still all fire giant form  matt yes you are  marisha thats cool okay with disadvantage  matt with /none/ disadvantage  marisha on both of them  matt on just one of them  marisha just one of them  matt because you only have one reaction  marisha thats eight plus 11 so thats 20  laura 19  matt that still hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats plenty  marisha so thats 7d6 plus six one two

creatures of his stature dont keep his belongings hidden  anywhere on himself theyre visible  liam thats a pretty big meatball  laura some spicy meatball  travis does the axe do anything when i hold it  matt its roughly twice the size of any /none/ axe youve held and is too large for you to use  laura and noelle aw  travis i really think thats a matter of perspective  sam would you like me to identify the object  travis yeah  sam all right  matt okay  liam weakly limps over  sam aye ill take a look at it  matt okay its referred to as a black iron axe of corruption its used primarily as a means of  intimidating and scaring off lessers and keeping subordinates in line  sam with magic or just with size  /none/ matt both its a minor enchantment the enchantment of it you get the essence as you look  at it the power of it was part of the presence of the pit fiend it was an inherent ability so  yeah this is not considered a very powerful magical item it was only powerful in the hands of  a pit fiend  travis i take it can i put it in the pool of blood  matt yeah sizzles  travis it dissolved it  matt no but the heat of it just naturally being in the space it /none/ steams as it goes in  travis thats a deep pool you guys like seriously drowning warning okay  noelle so wait who are you guys again  laura im going to pop trinket out of the necklace and cast cure wounds on him  noelle why

guess i know where my friends might be ive got to get back and see if  theyre still alive if theyre still in there  laura as shes saying this trinket goes and grabs some of the rotting meat out of one of those  and brings it to her as a present  marisha aw  noelle i accept it /none/ thanks buddy  matt and just gives you a big lick on the side of the face  laura are you still a bear  noelle im a

walkandtalk  laura yeah maybe we should get out of here  marisha well okay hang on what happens next because arent we supposed to be arrested next  travis yeah but we can check out the place until they get here can we check the rest of /none/ the room  first before we leave  matt yeah okay  travis especially that back wall  laura but being very careful for traps because they are present here  travis not me necessarily  matt oh so grog youre taking point  travis yep  matt okay grog you enter this chamber and it opens up into this candelabra area as you pass  this area i need you to make a dexterity saving throw grog  travis okay 15  matt 15 you take a few steps and then on one of the stone slabs beneath you /none/ a glyph suddenly  brightly shines with a strange pinkishorange glow and then you guys watch as a column of  somewhat translucent ethereal energy shoots up engulfing grog  laura what are you fucking doing  travis what  matt you suffer 21 points of psychic damage  travis yelps im too smart again  laughter  liam i fly in alongside you know all you have to do is ask will you hold still and give me ten  seconds and ill check the rest of the room just in case  taliesin ew  laura ew what /none/ is that  matt this is another one of the boiling blood chambers you saw earlier  liam okay im just going to check for traps  taliesin i like crimson peak as much as the next person but this is kind of over it  liam 30  matt 30 okay as you scan the room you do notice on the inside of each one of these pillars  is another one of the similar platforms to the one that grog triggered and the one that he triggered  here there are about two in width  liam theres /none/ spots on the ground  matt yeah this whole area here and this area and theres one here and one here and all these  can be triggered  liam all right just hold on stay over there do i see anything of value or anything else in the  room besides the traps  matt no but what you do notice vax you and vex and keyleth who have the highest passive  perception you hear from the ceiling above you what sounds like multiple entities  landing on the roof  liam all right weve got to amscray /none/  marisha i think reinforcements are here  laura this is definitely what we talked about  marisha did i see anything that looked like guards that wore like the armor the gold armor  matt not in the interior no  marisha no throughout the city  matt from where you are right now  marisha just in general since ive been in hell  laura yeah of course  marisha what are they  matt youve seen the different types youve seen a couple that have been imps youve seen a few  that have been winged humanoid /none/ entities  marisha were there any like erinyeses or succubuses that were also guards that would be one  of these people  matt you didnt see any of that specifically  taliesin were going to be okay we were expecting this  marisha i know but i could still be a guard and follow you guys there  taliesin then what  marisha then im someone on the outside and not in prison as maybe a first responder  laura i dont know  travis i think youre overthinking this  taliesin its a big prison i think youre /none/ going to be very far away from us very quickly  marisha if i say hey i found these guys and i walk with you guys all the way to the prison  matt a hatch from the ceiling in this chamber in here kicks open and about a dozen entities come  dropping in some winged others like spined similar bearded devils some of them wearing the  golden armor of the whisperers youve seen throughout the city it seems that the guard have  been called to the assault on this stronghold  laura i get trinket back /none/ in the necklace really fast  matt okay trinkets in the necklace whats everyone else doing  marisha can i stealth can i turn into one of the impish creatures in gold armor  matt sure yeah okay you turn into an imp  marisha have they seen me yet  matt you dont create equipment so you would be an imp youd

of the bone devils  matt a chain devil lands  marisha ill turn into a bone devil  matt okay you turn into bone devil form  laura why  liam her game man  matt at this point they swarm the room they have their weapons ready they see you guys  standing there not making an aggressive maneuver the two bone devils that land within the chamber  they seem to be wearing some sort of a sash that has a torn bottom portion of it and some sort of  symbol that is holding /none/ it together over their shoulder looks around  do you resist or do you surrender  travis im taking my cues from you here  laura highpitched we surrender  liam we surrender grog  travis i cant say it youve got say it  liam i surrender and hes coming along  matt i will accept this as universal surrender puts his arms up and you watch as a number of  these individuals begin pulling heavy chain manacles out from sacks and satchels two of them  immediately charge up and begin shackling grog multiple layers of chain /none/ and manacles across your  arms and legs they shackle you up and begin to spread into the next room coming to the rest of  you guys they charge in and begin just throat manacle to arms to ankles each with somewhat  slack chains and has a specific lead chain attached to the center of the whole  ensemble they go from person to person they throw them on you though you angrily give in to  it keyleth as you approach one of them turns to you and goes speaks infernal  marisha speaks fake infernal  /none/ matt make a deception check  marisha fucking hell  matt with disadvantage  travis you tried parseltongue  liam did you say you want to go to the disco with me  marisha eight total  noelle im not a butt  matt leans in real close to you  marisha i give him a little bit of a twitch like maybe im the damaged bone devil  matt liar the wings angry fluttering noise behind it as it points its finger at you a bunch  of the devils begin to swarm in from the sides with the /none/ various polearms and jagged weapons  pointed in your direction reveal thyself  marisha oh god okay i drop form  matt shackle her twice over of everyone you and grog both get the hannibal lecter treatment  as youre standing there with your spear out they all begin to swarm around you taryon  taliesin i say oh no whatever will we do we have this enormous piece of equipment that you  dont understand and could possibly be very dangerous and probably should be locked up with  the rest of us oh no  matt they dont /none/ seem to be paying any mind they throw the manacles on you they subdue you very  quickly with a swift hit to the back of your shoulders your sense of bravado is immediately  crumbled they throw you to the ground and chain you up you are all then chained together and  brought to your feet as one of the bone devils approaches you are found in the seeding stages  of usurpation of a trusted of dispater and are sentenced to moral reassignment and delivery you  are forfeit to mentiri grabs the chains tugs and you /none/ guys all begin to be pulled out and then  up through the hatch in this chamber through multitudes of devilish arms they are pulling you  up through the ceiling  laura this is a good plan good plan  taliesin its actually working better than i expected  matt you glance over your shoulder and watch as a series of devils have now leapt onto doty and are  pulling him apart  laura no this is the part where c3po is being pulled apart  sam he served his purpose  laura no  matt and thats /none/ where were going to take a break  liam he read you bedtime stories  travis holy shit  matt be back after a short break here theyre going to show a few ads and then the signal boost  episode that marisha just put out well continue our story here in just a few minutes guys see  you in a moment  travis aw doty poor bastard  break  matt welcome back hopefully the audios better for some folks thank you for being patient we  have a winner in the wyrmwood contest we had in the /none/ chat room alchemistkiller wins this awesome  set of zebra wood dice box dice tray and the dice roller so congratulations to you buddy  thisll be coming your way soon signed by the cast of critical role  laura killer  matt now diving back into where we were folks you guys are yanked out onto the streets of the  iron city of dis pulled off of the roof of utugashs personal stronghold and yanked across  the heated cobblestones having to keep through what strength you have standing for fear of  being dragged across the extremely /town/ hot floor as you are brought through people begin to gather up  on the sides of the street you begin to see other devils gathering towards the edges and every ten  minutes of walking when theres a crowd gathered around some of the devils will go ahead and crack  one of you in the back of the knee and give off a showing of ownership and a general sense of cheer  emerges with each person that gets smacked in the back of the head or thrust down percival you  get at one point hit along /none/ the side of the jaw and you feel the blood fill the side of your  mouth as you wish you could rub it with your hand though the way the chains are pulling  prevent you from raising your arm too high you hear the hissing and the occasional rocks being  thrown from the distance as youre pulled through vex and vax go ahead and roll  perception checks please  liam 27  laura 31  matt okay vex as this is happening and you watch percival recoil from the impact you glance  with a bit /town/ of a sneer towards the crowd and you watch amongst all these various toothy hissing  devils you see one familiar redskinned man with longish dark hair horns curled up and as his  eyes meet yours he gives you a smile and steps back with the crowd as it closes around him  laura i breathe a little easier  matt bits of filth are being chucked grog one not quite sure what form of refuse this is but it  smears and drips down the side of your face and gets stuck in your beard  laughter  /town/ laura gross  matt make a dexterity check  travis okay 17  matt 17 you catch it in your mouth and it is filthy you dont even know what it is you regret  the impulse immediately  travis spits  matt this goes on for about 15 minutes as you guys are pulled through you watch as nearby  whisperers begin to stop and perch on the edge of buildings to watch you get the sense that what  you guys have done has drawn some attention as you reach the end of this 15minute period youre  /town/ pulled down a large road and the buildings begin to grow a little thin in this area youre brought  to what looks to be a very very heavy set of doors this crimson gate that is humongous 20  feet by ten feet for each side of the gate so 40 feet across it leans at an angle like a  gargantuan cellar door that sits on its own in the center as you begin to approach you  hear chains suddenly metal scraping the doors slowly open with a creaking noise as youre  brought towards it they /dung/ open and you can see inside it is lightless it is dark the two bone  devils tugging further and with each tug the chains that connect you all choke and pull you  forward you nearly stumble again as youre brought over the stairway lip and down into this  darkened chamber below  you are brought down a seemingly endless set of stairs the darkness only occasionally broken by  the passing faintly redglowing sconce that passes by as youre brought down you hear the various  mutterings of various infernal phrases being spoken chuckled between the devils /none/ that speak in  your vicinity you then come to a leveling point the stairs come to an end the light opening up in  this area still dim the reddish glow that occasionally gives you a glimpse of the interior  this you can only imagine would be what a prison in hell looks like the metal and stone walls are  warped and misshapen in places theyre almost buckling under the weight of the plane theyre  holding you can see what looks to be stone arms that are either carved out of the walls or have  /none/ been jammed into it as part of the decor and you see giant metal hooks that occasionally eject out  the side some of them with the remains of some sort of prisoner or meat that has been left to  slowly rot more of those small devilish insects you encountered when you first arrived  are gathering and feasting on these remnants  you begin to hear various echoes of screams from some distant place within this labyrinthine series  of hallways that have bounced through enough walls to the point that its this constant ringing gasp  occasionally /none/ mixed with this highpitched whine this wailing and this sound of horrible torture  its very familiar to you tova you have no idea how long you were here before but it seems  endless in hindsight it could have been days weeks months you dont recall the air itself is  extremely hot stagnant and humid with sweat and has that subterranean putrescense to it the idea  that mold and suffering pervade the atmosphere and as youre carted through these hallways  youre turned right left forward past multiple intersections more devils pass by you see  another /none/ erinyes step by with three other minions to her sides she hisses as you walk past  you are brought past so many different pathways that it begins to all blend youre trying to pay  attention to remember which way you came but sometimes the turns almost go so fast it causes  you to lose track of where you originally started you get the essence that not only this is a  massive prison but its designed to keep anyone from finding their way back out  you turn one corner as you hear a series of very /none/ highintensity screams that cut through the  relative din in the background and as you turn you see three people two humans and one male  halfelf that are naked and strung up by chains in front of what looks like a large forge you see  there a 12foottall horned devil his wings folded up over his shoulders these giant crested  horns off the front of his skull very tim curry legendsstyle whos currently heating this  long brand in the forge as hes glaring at them and as you all walk past his eyes catch yours  /none/ and he gives you a nod as he sears it in the body of the halfelf who begins to quiver and scream  against the chains but he just gives you the rest of the head nod as you pass cross the door not  seeing them any further  sam i cant do this i cant go in there  matt you hear as you leave past the doorway you hear a voice echo from the chamber you just  passed ill see you soon enough  laura great cant wait  matt youre brought down another twisting series /none/ of intersecting halls the smell growing more and  more rancid the further in you go you see three chain devils wander past these roving jailers  dragging broken bodies behind them in manacles similar to yours you see trails of blood  streaking across that are slowly turning dry and thick with caked drying blood some bits turning  to mist across the hot stonework of the interior of the prison a twitch of one of the legs reveals  that these bodies are still living though by but an inch of their life a few errant chains that /none/  drift and drag behind them creepily caress the arm and face of taryon as you pass just across your  cheek one of them scratches you with  a hook at the tip  laura you fall unconscious  sam as were walking im going to whisper to percy are they going to take all our stuff  taliesin its going to be fine  sam i cant do anything without my stuff  taliesin were going to be fine  matt your weapons have been gathered and they have been taken from you  sam everything armor helmets /none/  matt you have your armor on you still your helmet is not currently on you thats been taken  off but your weapons have been taken from you because you cant hold your weapons  in your chains  laura thats a break of contract  taliesin not yet  laura all right  matt so further still youre finally brought within this 30 foot by 20 foot room bisected by a  series of thick metal bars that open into a cell a single towering chain devil sits within larger  than any youve encountered the broad shoulders /none/ are almost as wide as grogs and the head is so  deeply set within the neck that it almost gives a profile from shoulder to shoulder of a square and  it cross nice  laura and taliesin nope  marisha fuck this asshole  matt the chains all begin to slacken as you enter and the arms reach out almost in a graceful  invitation you hear his horrible voice slither out from the mask of black metal that covers  everything but his deep red burning beady eyes good string them up as the devil entourage  /none/ that has pulled you through this prison brings you into the cell one by one they take your manacles  and latch them onto a thick heavy metal chain as they pull it pulls your arms up over your body  and your leg manacles are attached to similar rings on the ground one by one you are all  placed within this chamber chained up helpless  sam this is the worst  matt all the rest of the devils that brought you in here exit the cell and leave through the  hallway leaving the chain devil to /none/ do his duty he approaches the bars as he closes the  entranceway to the cell so hes on the other side of the cell from all of you youre just strung up  in there and hes pressed up against the bars from the other side his hands clutching as he stares  across you his eyes slowly scanning as he moves his hands down the bars the chains go limp and  unfurl around parts of his arms and begin to snake and slither across the ground a dozen of them or  so slowly creeping like tendrils /none/ of living entities towards all of you as he says you seem  weary lets loosen your load as the chains begin to snake their way up each of your bodies  grog you feel one come up your torso and under the gauntlets and begin to loosen the gauntlets on  your arm underneath vex you feel as one curls up spirals around your leg and finds its way  under your armor and eventually finds the buckles in the back and begins to undo them all of you  find the chains are all beginning to move  /none/ laura i saw this movie  laughter  matt beginning to infiltrate and remove the various bits of equipment you all came into this  area on a voice rings out from across the chamber in the darkness it goes krix you are needed by  overseer shushot for prisoner enumeration and status at which point the chains stop and the  chain devil releases his fingers tense against the bars the chains begin to slack and pull back  from your bodies and retract back into the chamber you now see behind him stepping in a  small green /none/ devil with long knifelike ears a series of long spines across his body similar  though a thicker version of the merchant that you saw earlier on your journey here this one  carrying the same sash that the bone devils that originally arrived had adorned on their chest it  does actually carry a satchel on one side as the jailer pulls the chains back to his body he  snarls and turns back to this barbed devil who winces and recoils as soon as the chain devil  turns already taking a submissive stance after making his announcement /none/ in the chamber  the chain devil i do despise such droll work turns back to all the rest of you i will return  lovelies the chains retract back into his body and he walks out of the chamber past the barbed  devil shoulderchecking it on the way through slips to the side as it leaves youre all still  there chained up  the green devil waits rubbing its shoulder comes forward sheepishly looking at all of you in  silence breathing heavily rubbing its chin takes its satchel and you can see it has this  /none/ hefty satchel on the side thats filled with a series of side pockets and small openings and it  begins to pry them open and it begins to produce each one of your weapons and is pulling them out  quickly and throwing them into a pile on the outside of the bars pulls out your packs the  various things that were taken from you have all been put within this satchel and is quickly  throwing them into a pile on the other side of the bars from all of you throws them all onto the  ground /none/ finishes in this big mass there unspoiled unharmed now to guide you and the  creature walks up to the bars and clutches the sides staring at you you seek hotis yes  liam yes  matt he is under the ceiling of iskath though iskath is not in mentiri this day you must leave  this room turn right left straight straight left straight then right the iron door with the  fanged grin bears the mark there lies your quarry now my debt is paid goodbye and the  devil turns around and begins to run out of /none/ the chamber  laura oh shit i missed the last thing that he said i got all the directions but i didnt hear  the very last thing that he said  liam door with a grin  laura door with a grin  matt door with a fanged grin  liam right left straight straight left straight right  laura wait i got right left straight straight left straight right  travis thats what ive got too  marisha right left yeah right left

get anything  out from between those two bars on /none/ the outside of the room  matt trinket goes over to the edge of the bars and leans into them and is marking a claw across  the ground and its about a good foot away from the equipment and you can see that smoke  begin to rise  laura did you get that  liam yes dead for a ducat its dead  cheering  matt five experience to sam riegel  travis laughs five experience  matt you can see that the fur is beginning to send off smoke smoke and burn against the bars as hes /none/  leaning against them  laura okay back away  maybe you can try and just break through these manacles can you do that  matt reaches up and grabs the one around your ankle and tugs and you see it begin to singe the  outside of his tongue and hes pulling make a strength

over and  liam is it a sticky one  laura yeah its really really tough i could have done the chains on /none/ all of us and you could  have done this but whatever  liam all right rather than do it i

yes  sam im just rubbing my wrists  travis 26 so 52  matt its your strength modifier  travis which is eight and i rolled a 18  matt right thats 18 to see if you hit so go ahead and roll damage for the purposes of this  roll roll 1d4 and /none/ add your strength modifier  travis 1d4  laura thats a six thats a 1d6 hey great  travis strength modifier thats ten  matt ten double that because siege so its 20  travis 20  matt so with your onefist punch between the damage you had done to the lock by messing with  it and the impact of your fist the lock shatters and the door squeaks open  travis you loosened it for me nice job  laura i reach through and try to grab everything in pass it out  matt you pull the equipment /none/ in you get your rod you get everything situated  laura okay i cast  taliesin have we technically had a short rest since we were basically just manacled walking for  a while  matt nope  taliesin okay just checking  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us  travis ooh good call  marisha do we want to take a short rest while were supposedly  travis nope  laura nope  taliesin nope nope lets just  marisha all right lets go  laura i think it would be best if maybe /none/ we i mean i dont know how well we can stealth around  here if we should maybe turn into insects and just crawl around here  marisha i can do that to us  laura i think we should do that  marisha is everyone cool with that  laura but ive definitely got a pass without a trace still on us  taliesin can we still plane shift later  marisha i can still plane shift us so i can burn one of my higherlevel spells like an eight on  the scale of zero to nine and /none/ be animals and then i can save my seventhlevel for plane shift  in case of emergency  taliesin okay  laura solid copy on that  travis wait a minute but doesnt the floor burn are we going to flip out of that shape real fast  noelle the floor does burn  laura but maybe those little insects are immune to the fire since they live here  travis but were animals though were not insects were animals  laura wait we cant be those little  travis no  liam cant we fly cant we be flying /none/  marisha can i not do that with animal shapes i cant turn into the insects  matt animal shapes you can only do beasts  travis yeah i remember we had this conversation before  sam well why dont we be pigeons that can fucking fly  matt and the creatures that you saw the insects here are technically very very small fiends  marisha hm  laura oh really  liam but we could be hornets or flies  marisha have i seen anything like flies or rats or anything like that  travis not insects  laura /none/ not insects  matt youve seen rats but they dont do well here because of the heat  liam theres flies all over this shit  laura maybe hummingbirds something the teensiest bird you can think of  liam were not in the woods though flies  marisha hang on ive seen rats and ive seen what have i seen any  laura we cant be insects we can only be animals  marisha ive got to be beasts  laura yeah so teeny teeny teeny like finches or hummingbirds  marisha are there anything like bats have i ever /none/ seen any bats  laura ooh bats down here  matt youve seen bats before you havent seen bats that reside in this domain  laura whatever as long as were flying maybe we can be stealthy well be stealhty bats  travis what happens if we hit a door on this rightleftstraightstraightleftstraightright  sam lets just walk  marisha i mean technically with animal shapes i can change us with an action correct  matt thats true i think so yeah  laura so we can just shift in and out whenever we want with an action  marisha /none/ yeah as long as we dont get caught  travis i dont mind starting out that way  liam all right  laura okay i think getting yeah we should its easier to not get caught and then well stealth  as bats  taliesin stealthy bats  marisha all right so were starting as bats bats  laura sure  travis what do our bats sound like  liam where is harvey dent  highpitched squealing  matt okay this is concentration so this will get rid of your shapechange  marisha correct so as long as were cool /none/ with me losing my ninthlevel shapechange i cant escort  us as an erinyes anymore  sam i think we should just walk but if you want to do this you can  travis ooh wait well  laura i think well just theres a lot of demons around here devils  marisha how much longer is my shapechange left it lasts for an hour  travis you dont speak that shit is the problem  matt youre not quite certain but its pushing close to an hour  laura yeah you dont speak the shit so even if you /none/ have it  marisha i dont speak the shit so bats  laura stealthy bats we fly close to the ceiling and be as quiet as possible  noelle i dont care for this  travis i know its not a bear but at least they both start with a d  noelle bears bats  matt all of you guys turn into bats flapping  marisha wait i can technically make some of us bats and some of us other things correct  i can choose  matt yup  marisha does anyone not want to be a bat /none/ for any particular reason  laura im solid with the bat but im going to lead the way since im good with directions  sam since bats cant see maybe we should  taliesin they can see  travis take off ill follow you  matt essentially you get  marisha sonar  laura oh but we can still see where were going  matt yeah the equivalent of darkvision you know where youre going  marisha echolocation  laura is it echolocation only  taliesin no they have both i mean biologically they have both  marisha we have /none/ darkvision  laura okay  travis im following vex out  taliesin yup  marisha bats go in swarms were all bats  matt all right so a bat swarm suddenly emerges into the hallway which immediately turns right  and left which direction do you go  laura right  matt okay you turn right and as you guys rush into the corner you watch as the chain devil that  originally arrived in the first chamber  laura flying close to the ceiling stealthy  sam stealthy  matt right its about 15 feet up to the ceiling /none/ and you guys come up the chain devil walks  beneath and as you guys arc past him he kind of stops and looks over and watches you all go past  him and he keeps walking looking very confused  liam fly with purpose fly with purpose  laura okay fly with purpose fly with purpose  matt all right so you guys continue  laura as soon as we get to a thing we turn left  matt yes so you go forward for about 60 70 feet or so you see a couple of small imps also /none/ fly  past and you guys kind of dart around and they all look curiously at these bats that are swarming  past them  marisha this is the best  laura at least theyre letting us go right now  taliesin everythings fine  matt you come to a t intersection now  laura left oh  travis straight  liam straight  sam wait do we go right what  laura wait no we havent gone left yet  liam we didnt take a left yet  travis yeah  liam i thought we were taking it  /none/ matt you turned right  laura yes and now were going to turn left  matt and then you turn left all right you all shift following vexs pathway left and as you  go forward in that direction you watch as another chain devil and two barbed devils similar to the  one that came in there and brought your equipment are patrolling down the hall as you guys are  approaching i want everyone to roll a stealth check  liam yeah plus ten  laura plus ten  marisha plus ten  laura im going to say /none/ trinkets back in the necklace by the way  matt i assumed  laura okay  noelle so that plus ten for them that was their feast  laura no that was me i did that  travis pass without a trace  matt spell she cast she cast on everybody so everyone gets plus ten dice  noelle oh okay cool cool  sam 17  taliesin 35  marisha 26  liam 37  noelle 15  laura 34  travis 25  matt okay as you guys fluttering noises past the barbed devils just keep walking forward /none/ the  chain devil stops and turns and looks over and sees you all  laura just keep flying  matt and turns and starts walking in your direction as you guys keep flying you come to a  gate that is closed  taliesin a gate  liam solid or bars  matt its solid there is a small opening with some bars that are about that far apart each  laura lets go through them  taliesin we can go through  matt you guys as bats press through the gate just as  laura avoiding the bars /none/ avoiding the bars  matt  just as the chain devil runs up to try and grab at you as you guys charge through his  arms catching the gate and you hear him start yelling and suddenly you start hearing in the  distance behind where you were sounds like rapid footprints footfalls apparently people are now  aware that you have escaped your cell  laura fuck fuck fuck  noelle fuck  sam im batman  matt so you guys continue rushing forward  marisha we can always be rats whenever the time is necessary  travis /none/ no no well burn out of it well burn out of it  laura lets just keep going  marisha keep going  matt you guys come to another t section  laura straight  matt you go straight on this one all right you go straight past beneath you you can see theres  another one of those blood pools that was in utugashs chamber and there are a couple of  grates on each side you can see the grates are corroded with the quick glances as you go past as  you continue straight forward you hear /none/ more screams from the right and left side the two  hallways that you pass just kind of screaming echoing past and you just keep pushing forward as  best as you can you hear the gate in the distance open so now you know whoever was giving chase  theyre now starting to pick up behind you you come up to what looks to be a right and left  sam wait what  laura wait only a right and left but we have two straights in a row  sam we go straight  liam yeah is there /none/ any hidden door here search for a hidden door  sam we go straight into the wall  liam im searching for a door as a bat  taliesin straight in the door keep going straight  matt make an investigation check  marisha come on come on come on  laura keep going straight  liam 18  matt 18 you briefly glance forward as you guys sit here for a second and you begin to hear the  distant sound of various infernal yells getting louder and louder something about the wall right  in front of you /none/ doesnt look right  laura keep going straight  liam i start battering into the door  laura can we batter into it or can we just fly straight through  matt vax just passes straight through its an illusory wall  yelling  matt as you guys flapping noise into this next chamber  liam everybodys doing something different  matt yeah  noelle its like fuck okay  matt tovas so confused  noelle this has been a weird day  liam arent you glad youre playing with us  laura tarys got wings coming out of his /none/ head  matt as you guys are flying in this new chamber it is pitch black thankfully your vision allows  you as best to see tova you start having the recurring memory of the fact that youre not sure  where theyre going where theyre taking you but you still have people in this prison  noelle yeah am i looking out do i recognize anything that were passing  matt you have no idea where they are and you have no idea where you are currently  noelle can i use my heightened senses to do a perception /none/ check and see if i can smell anything  matt you would if you werent a bat  noelle i mean theres nothing in the rule book that says bats cant have heightened senses  marisha hang on well technically what do bats have  travis not a great sense of smell thats for sure  noelle i dont need to be a bear to do that it says thats just part of my class  matt i know i know when youre in your normal form you would  sam as bats  matt as bats however its a /none/ little more rough let me check real fast just to be safe  noelle can i use my sonar  marisha 5e bats  matt here we go  taliesin nothing quite like googling 5e bats  laura yeah  marisha bats  matt lets say swarm of bats thats basically what you guys are all together  marisha thats true we are a swarm of bats  matt now you have echolocation so you can you know  liam oh man put us in a strahd campaign  matt you have keen hearing but thats not going to help /dung/ you tremendously in this circumstance so  yeah there is a sinking feeling that right now either you going with them you might leave your  friends behind just be aware as you guys push forward into this dark chamber it continues  forward and then dips down into a series of stairs takes you to a secondary level below as  you guys follow this down for about 45 feet it evens out again and opens up into another  tintersection  laura travis left  matt all right you guys go ahead and turn left as you turn /dung/ right around the corner there  waiting you see there is a single bone devil and three flying spined devils these deep blue dark  green implike devils with these giant spined wings and these long quills sticking out of their  body as they carry these spears and you all almost you encounter each other at once the  spined devils are up in your area and as you kind of flutter past theres no way  they didnt see you  laura chaos chaos  marisha bat squeaks  liam drop some guano  laura yeah i poop /none/  matt okay  travis i poop  taliesin smells better than the prison  liam guano guano guano  matt as this is happening the bone devil stops and turns and the spine devils that get caught up  in the area two of them are going to instinctively swing at you guys as you move past  laura oh god  matt that is going to be theres the spined devil here that is an eight  sam oh wow  taliesin oh  sam that might actually miss  matt i think it does actually the worst /none/ possible a bat has an ac of 12  taliesin yeah  sam guys we have one hit point by the way  taliesin oh yeah  laura oh  marisha those bats were jus i made no promises other than bats  travis one hit point  matt one hit point each of you the other one is going to swing same roll two sixes in a row  cheering  matt eight eight that is aw man  travis aw man  liam matt turned 12 matt turned 12  matt so both of them miss as you /none/ guys continue pushing forward past these  marisha go go go  matt however the full speed of a bat if i remember  sam 30 feet  matt is it 30foot speed  sam its a 30foot fly speed  marisha and were definitely doubling our movement here  taliesin and were doubling movement  laura yeah  matt correct  liam were dashing  marisha and were dashing  matt the spine devils are a little faster than you guys  sam ooh  matt and theyre gaining on you as you move past they get their attack /none/ swings but you guys do  double dash so theyre behind you and now theyre all starting to slowly gain as theyre pushing  forward and pushing forward you come to another tintersection  laura straight  matt you go straight okay as you go straight forward it kind of curves a little bit to the  right and then continues forward the spine devils are just starting to catch up to you guys and two  of them go ahead and lets see what attacks they have here  noelle are we passing any cells  matt theyre both /none/ going to fire tail spines at you their tail curves up behind and swings and  they fire these spines forward  laura fly zig zag fly zig zag  sam serpentine  matt theres three of them so one of thems going to be at grog ones going to be at vax and ones  going to be at percy against grog that is a two plus four these guys cant hit anything six  just zooms past you one towards vax thats cocked natural 20  groaning  matt and against you percy that is a 19 plus /none/ two so both of you guys get hit  laura fuck  matt even basic damage both of your bat forms boof and you both fall about ten feet  liam is it an attack roll or  laura yeah  matt yeah they both hit spines hit you you both take  liam but if its under my ac  laura no its a bats ac  travis youre a bat  liam oh were a bat bats ac  marisha bat ac  matt bats ac which is 12  liam thanks  matt so thats six so /none/ you take five points of damage vax to your main form and percival you  take four points of damage to your main form oh plus one point of fire damage and two points of  fire damage  liam my armor is set to fire so do i take one anyway  matt you still take one  liam okay  taliesin okay yeah just the two of us  matt all right so the rest of you are bats both of you plummet hit the ground and the spine  devils approach  taliesin attempt to acrobat roll /none/ so that im up and rolling  sam oh boy here we go  laura oh dear lord  matt so now we have vax and  marisha we did pretty good you guys we got pretty far  laura yeah we did get pretty far  taliesin we did a lot we did well  matt vax and percival are back this way im going to say that these guys represent you as  bats well say that taryon is one keyleth is two tova is three vex is four and grog is five  all right so well /none/ use these for spine devils for now well actually theyre pretty small so  well use these so these are the spine devils right here and you see a bone devil coming up in  the distance so i need everyone to roll initiative  travis yeah dont fuck me gil thats it go  liam terrible terrible  marisha all right not great  matt all right so that brings us to 25 to 20  taliesin 30  noelle 25  laura wow  matt jesus percival  travis 20  matt so 30 20  travis tova /none/ had  noelle 25  matt 25 nice  taliesin are we making noise now do we care  noelle no that was bad math 23  matt okay still good  marisha i dont know if we can get in and out of this quick and keep going  matt 20 to 15  marisha  because i can keep turning us into these  matt all right 15 to ten  travis 15 to ten  marisha 11 as long as i dont lose concentration i can keep turning us into different things  taliesin including the two /none/ of us even though we hit one  marisha correct  taliesin good to know  matt all right ten to five  liam big seven  laura eight  marisha its a concentration of up to 24 hours so as long as i dont use a concentration  travis what are you tary  sam four  laura oh  matt nice  travis oh shit  marisha on a subsequent turn i can use my action to transform affected creatures into new forms  matt so now in these forms if it looks like it  sam we /none/ do get an attack  matt you do but you attack as a bat  sam yeah  travis rabies  laura can keyleth just  sam and a hit is one point of piercing damage  laura wait what was your initiative order what was your number  marisha 11  laura fuck  marisha not great  noelle were stuck as bats until she lets us out  matt yup  laura as long as you just stay out of the way and dont break your concentration you can keep  turning us in and out  marisha /none/ correct  laura okay dont get hit  marisha so thats probably exactly what im going to do is to try and not get hit by the by  matt percival you just plummeted to the ground actually both you and vax from the fall since  you were 15 feet up you both took two points of bludgeoning damage and five points of bludgeoning  damage vax  liam okay  matt all right  taliesin okay im going to take my six paces towards the lava pit and then  travis is it a blood pit or a /none/ lava pit  matt its a blood pit  taliesin  blood pit and then im going to hold my attack until vax does what hes going to do  matt okay  taliesin im loud  liam yeah and im weak  matt all right that ends percys turn tova  noelle so can i go from a bat to a bear  liam batbear werebatbear batman  sam there batbear  laura tricky tricky  liam bearman manbear  matt the magic keeps you  marisha choose any number of willing creatures that you can see within range /none/ you transform each  target into the form of a large or smaller beast  matt technically you are not a dwarf you are not a blood hunter you lost the abilities of your  class while you are currently a bat so currently you just have bat capabilities you could move and  then hold your action if you were to change forms its up to you kind of what percy did  taliesin get in position and then wait  noelle im going to fly over with my dudes and hang out and hold my action  matt /none/ all right so youll hang there all right grog  travis im just following vex  matt okay so youll just kind of stay over in this area  travis im real good with directions but lets be honest  matt all right so these three spine devils who just hit the other this one here is going to  rush over to this side is going to fire this is going to be at tova its going to fire its tail  spine that is an eight i keep rolling sixes to hit misses no effect these two other /none/ spine  devils here are going to there we go theyre going to come forward and do a multiattack on  vax both of them are just going to pincer up this way one with its bite and one with its fork  actually technically it gets to use two tail spines its going to make a second strike at you tova  that is an 11 misses still  noelle yup i mean unless my  sam unhittable bats  noelle unless my bat stats are bad  matt bat ac is 12 so youre actually like whoosh you /none/ dodge out of the way  noelle oh okay  matt and that is a seven and a 21 21 hit you  liam no nope oh it just hits me  matt it just thats what i thought so you take five points of piercing damage  liam can i uncanny dodge  matt all right you take two points of piercing damage  liam okay  matt the other one is going to attack you again twice as well thats a four and an 11 nope  liam yeah eat it  matt ending their turn now the /none/ bone devil is going to catch up flies in its wings expanding  forward its going to go ahead and make three attacks against you vax since youre the closest  one to it that is ten 20 and 20  liam no  matt two twelves in a row you just whoosh dodging out of the way being crazy rogue  evading that brings us now to keyleth  marisha oh shit can i change people as a bat  matt yeah as an action you can change your form which is an action  marisha but can i /none/ stay as a bat and change other people  matt yeah  marisha yeah  matt it says here on a subsequent action you can use your actions to transform affected  creatures into new forms so yeah i dont see why you couldnt  marisha okay im going to turn do you want to be a bat too  taliesin yeah im useless  marisha im going to turn both vax and percy into bats what i asked what you wanted to be and you  said a bat bat were both bats  liam that is what i /none/ want to be you just do it  travis you didnt even have time to ask that question  marisha and were peaced out again  laura if we can were going to peace out  marisha if we can were going to peace out  matt who else is going to turn into bats  sam bats were all bats  laura were all bats again  matt okay all right and so youre just going to do that its your turn you going to move  marisha im going to look at vex and go squeaking noise  /none/ laura i wink as a bat like i totally understand her  matt okay is that your turn keyleth  marisha uhhuh  travis youre not going to move  marisha im following her  laura well would she move shes got to wait until vax gets out of there now hes surrounded  and hes a bat  marisha vex was leading the way she knows where to go  matt vex your turn  laura i want to lead everybody away down to the right but ive got to make sure that my brother  gets away from /none/ these thugs before that happens so im going to hold my movement until can i  matt you cant hold your movement you can only hold an action you can hold a dash action  laura im going to hold my dash action then until i see that hes safe or at least hes away  from them so we can get going  liam as a bat do i have an action and bonus action like vax does or just one thing now  matt you have your action as a bat you can dash still if you want /none/ to  liam well i will disengage as a bat  matt disengage is an action  liam can i use my action to disengage  matt so you could  laura bats disengage  liam yeah were in new territory  matt anybody can disengage as an action its just a combat action you just cant do anything  else the only thing you can do is move with your speed after that  liam if they hit me im back to being in regular form again and theres three of them so im  going to disengage  /none/ matt all right so you disengage  liam  and then fly as far as i can towards the group  matt okay 30 feet five ten 15 20 25 30 thats where you get  laura okay i see him and we have everybody now i take off to the right  matt which way is the right you guys moved in this way so this way  laura yeah  matt okay so using your dash action  laura it was the last thing it was to the right was the final turn right  sam yup yup /none/  marisha right yeah to the right  taliesin ive been holding an action right can i burn that as a dash action  laura i know why did he say it like that like it was  marisha yeah as far as we know the right means right  sam maybe its stage right  laura but everything else was im going to the right thats the last intersection that i know  matt all right so that ends vexs turn there taryon  sam im going to go where she went and further if i can  matt /none/ and you are off the page over that way  taliesin can i burn my action as a dash  matt you can yeah  taliesin yeah im burning my action as a dash  matt all right so thats  marisha lets go  sam bye  laura toodles as much as we can be toodles  marisha dear god i cant believe this shit  matt that brings us to percy  taliesin im going to keep booking  matt five ten 30 and you also with a double move get to there okay next up is tova /none/  noelle oh ill just keep going with the rest  matt you just keep going all right so you catch up with these guys here way off the map all  righty grog  travis im going to burn my ashton as a darsh  laughter  matt gibberish all righty with that the spine devils are going to move forward  laura who is that is that keyleth  matt that is percy  laura oh it is no but percys off the map  matt oh im sorry its keyleth yeah because i have onetwo but you /none/ guys both transformed  marisha but i was holding my movement to move with vex  laura and taliesin you cant hold movement  marisha i cant fucking hold a movement i did an action to make sure they were bats  matt yep so you get swarmed by  three spined devils  laura fucking balls this is not good planning  liam we might be able to outrun them  matt not in this form attacks against you yep thats an 18 keyleth you take six points of  slashing damage your bat form is gone you drop /none/ that you become keyleth again and you take five  points of damage carried over then its going to get its tail attack against you its going to  miss the other ones going to bite miss tail attack is going to be a 17 whats your ac  marisha currently 16  matt so you take six points of piercing damage the last ones going to get its last two attacks  on you that is a 21 and a natural one so the last attack you get is four points of  slashing damage  marisha so its /none/ six plus four total so ten okay  matt and i need you to go ahead and make three concentration checks its got to beat  ten each time  marisha good the first time good the second time and seven plus my constitution correct  matt yes  marisha so that is an 11 the third time  matt your constitution saving throw  marisha all three  matt thats enough so you maintain concentration on the spell  laura solid  liam thanks keyleth  marisha youre welcome  matt the bone devil flies up and is now /none/ going after keyleth with all of its might  marisha did we heal any we didnt do any of that healing or anything did we  matt nope you didnt

spoke common  sam okay did he work in the prison  matt the chain devil did  sam great chain devil so im going to make a programmed illusion upon anyone approaching a  chain devil will appear over the dead bodies that we just killed and say there were five of them  they went that way and point down the hallway that we just came out of go get them now make  them pay  cheering  matt all righty as you pull the scroll /none/ out and you watch the scroll burst into flame as you  finish the incantation you watch as out of the blood pool rising this chain devil looking  real material steps up and walks over to the bodies and sits there looking over them waiting  for someone to trigger  laura okay we should put dust of tracelessness down dust of tracelessness on the ground  matt okay you start flower girling your way  marisha i hold my wall of stone since he has that because i dont want to make it apparent  matt get this /none/ map out if we can okay so you guys continue to the right thank you and bring  the last one in you guys head down this hallway for about another hundred feet hearing the shouts  behind you hear conversation different languages happening theyre getting a little more distant  youre catching some ground here and its going well eventually you make your way  sam jesus theres another whole fucking map  marisha the doors always this is matt mercer were talking about  liam im looking for fucking traps  matt you guys make your way down /none/ to the end of this chamber and you see three different doors  that are all closed off to the front to the right and the left  liam fanged smiles  laura fanged smile  matt as youre making your investigation check you hear what sounds like the writhing of chains  and the pulling of heavy metal grinding as you begin to look and inspect the doors real fast you  glance up and the entire ceiling is a sea of rolling chains all gathering and then from the  ceiling bursts down in the center of the /none/ chamber  yelling  matt a chain golem slams into the center its glowing red eyes from underneath all right as  you guys have all scattered amongst these chambers you ran down vax just rushed up and began to  inspect these here what are you guys doing  marisha wait is this it is this where were supposed to be  taliesin weve got to find out which room hes in  matt all right everyone roll initiative  travis oh my god what size is that thing  matt its almost 20 feet tall and when it /none/ slams the ground its hunched forward if it were  standing upright it would scrape the ceiling  travis so its fire giant size  matt a little bit under fire giant size but you watch the chains from the ceiling are still  attached to it its like the whole ceiling and upper portion of this chamber is made of chains  that are feeding it  laura do we have anything to freeze  marisha to freeze yeah we have our shit back right  taliesin yeah  laura if we can freeze him in place maybe hes /none/ made of metal  matt 25 to 20  laura 24  matt 24  noelle 21  matt tova and what did you roll for your investigation check earlier  liam oh 22  matt 22 this doorway the first one you checked does not seem to have the symbol on it appears  to be some sort of infernal symbol that you dont recognize all right 20 to 15  marisha 17  taliesin 15  matt 15 to ten  travis 13  matt taryon  sam two  travis wow  liam eight for vax  /none/ matt all right vex youre up first  laura can i run to the other doors that vax has been looking at  matt which one of these are you checking  laura huh  matt which one of these doors are you checking  laura the far one in the back yeah and ill look for the symbol  matt make an investigation check  laura 23  matt 23 you go and look up and this one has a symbol that looks like a halfmoon that is broken  and is bleeding into a pool below it  /none/ laura and im looking for a fanged grin  matt its a crescent halfmoon that looks like its broken in the middle  laura that totally could be a fanged grin okay  sam which one  laura the very back door  matt this one and this one have been inspected so thats your movement to get up there and your  action to look thoroughly and look at the symbol in the low light you have a bonus still  laura yeah is it possible to bonus hide  matt you have nowhere to hide from you have /none/ nothing obscuring  laura nothing to obscure the view  matt not really  laura okay then im going to use my bonus to pop trinket out  matt okay trinket appears out of your necklace  laura i guess he was already out wasnt he because we were running  matt yeah but you may have pulled him back in its fine  laura thats a waste of bonus laughs no im going to hunters mark so trinket was out im  going to hunters mark the guy  matt all right ill go with it hunters mark on /none/ the chain golem tova your turn  noelle okay im going to run over there behind the chain golem where vex is im going to do a  perception check i guess ill check out this last door  matt okay  noelle can i do a general sense of smell for the whole area and see if i smell anything coming from  any of these prisons  matt sure make a perception check as youre rushing in  laura what about symbols do you see anything  matt with advantage  noelle yep all right so that is /none/ a 23  matt 23 the chambers seem to have various scents that kind of mix in this area the one on the far  end has this ancient dusty decay smell to it the one on the opposite side of the chamber has a  weirdly iron rusty old metal scent and the doorway that youre at right now has a very strong  scent of sulfur  noelle is there anything on the door  matt make an investigation check  noelle wheres investigation thats an 18  matt you knock the dust from the side and as /none/ you inspect closely hearing the chains grinding and  spinning around you and occasionally you duck because you see one kind of whip across and break  part of the stone and cause chunks of it to fly off you look down and you see two small eyes and  one deep toothy grin  noelle hey this ones smiling  laura but is it a fanged grin a fanged grin is usually cocked but it looks more  noelle he doesnt appear sincere so what do i have left  matt well as a note just remember this it /none/ took you a while to get there because the chains that  were rolling around it are entangling and wrapping around the area so you were at half movement  which got you just to there i forgot to mention that earlier however the chains in the process  are crushing and doing damage as you move through them six points of bludgeoning damage to you as  you pull your way through the chains getting to that area all right that ends tovas turn it is  now the chain golems turn  noelle do i have an extra /none/ action or anything  matt your action was to do the investigation you have your bonus if you have something to spend it  with  noelle turn into a bear  matt sure  laura laughs i turn into a bear  matt and bear form sings and bear form there is your bear form all righty so ending tovas  turn it is now the golems turn the golem has a tenfoot range on its slam its going to do two  slam attacks its going to reach out and slam once at percy who is within its /none/ front range there  after landing and keyleth whos immediately to its left  laura dont fucking die keyleth  matt a physical slam attack a giant batteringram of heavy thick chains are going to  punch out towards percival the fist swings and almost merges with the rest of the body as a  second arm forms where it was and then backfists into keyleth like its form shifts with the chains  that move around within its body and its form is everchanging and shifting like a giant amoeba of  moving metal the first attack towards percival /none/ that is 27 to hit  taliesin oh my god yes  matt all right you suffer 22 points of bludgeoning damage and against keyleth that is a  25 to hit  marisha yep  matt keyleth you take 21 points of bludgeoning damage  sam is sanctuary still working on her  matt actually sanctuary is on has to make a wisdom saving throw before it can do that which  it fails you take no damage  cheering  matt it rolled a two and had a zero wisdom modifier  marisha oh thats good thats great /none/  matt so as it goes to strike you the second fist appears and then seems to dwindle and fall to the  ground and it forms again in the spot where it was you watch as multiple arms are now forming  and coming out of it at different places its going to back up as it does so its eyes shift  these two red beady points of light that form its eyes kind of shift to the back of its head and  now you see theyre almost moving around and its keeping a visual range of /none/ everything in the room  taliesin do i get an attack of opportunity since were moving out of its combat range  matt no it was not in your combat range it had reach unfortunately that ends its turn keyleth  youre up  marisha okay i need to stay alive whos close to me in a 30foot radius and whos looking  rough  travis you  matt everyone but vex and trinket are in a 30foot radius  marisha okay i want to start backing out a little bit and whos lowest on hit points

spellcasting ability  okay  matt yep so 3d8 plus six go for it percy youre up next  marisha oh my god thats amazing oh thats a one  sam you can reroll ones  marisha no only if its elemental damage eight 16 17 plus six  matt six so 23  marisha 23 points  matt 23 points of healing so mark that in guys thats your action  /none/ marisha and then im backing out a little bit  matt backing this way or this way  marisha yeah away from the chain golem yeah that way  matt this way if you move one more hes going to get attack of opportunity on you because youre  within melee range of him right now  marisha fucking hell  matt you want to risk it or not  marisha yeah ill risk it  matt okay  laura can you transform anymore or are you spent  marisha i can do it one more time but only to /none/ an animal not an elemental  matt okay so you back up it takes a swing at you with its chain slam that is 26 to hit  marisha yep  matt you take  sam is sanctuary still on her  matt 30 points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin and laura sanctuary  matt sanctuary thank you for reminding me that is a 14  marisha miss  matt whats your dc 17  sam on what my spell dc  matt yeah spell dc  sam 17  matt 17 it goes to swing again towards you as /none/ a reaction and the magic prevents it from actually  hitting its mark and the chains retract back into its body  taliesin yeah  matt so no damage is sustained  sam matt if i may be  laura no  sam technically he can choose another target  marisha are you going to be honest  laura oh because he failed  sam no it just says in sanctuary you can either fail or he can choose another target  matt thats true all right so instead  sam sorry just saying  matt no thats good itll /none/ go to tova and vax for the two attacks that he got sanctuary earlier  so to vax that is a 31  liam no that does not hit  matt so you take the 30 points of damage instead  marisha youre taking it for me  liam yes i am  marisha thanks boyfriend  matt against tova that is a natural one  noelle thats a what  matt natural one to hit you so it actually slams into the door above  laura does it break through the door  matt ill make a strength check /none/ now  liam happy to  matt the door cracks and it partially gets pushed inward somehow the chain golem actually helped  you out thats interesting all right that ends its turn keyleth youre up no sorry that was  keyleths turn percy youre up  taliesin im out of its range now  matt you are currently just out of its range  taliesin okay im going to back up a bit move me behind that and then move me  the other pillar  matt oh this way  taliesin head that way does it look like /none/ those chains are feeding it  matt it doesnt look like its feeding it more than just the chains are keeping it attached to  the walls the mass of the chains are still in its chest  taliesin and it has eyeballs  matt it has some sort of two glowing light sources within the mass of chains that form where  its head would be  taliesin would a headshot to those eyeballs actually be a thing that might work  matt you can try it  taliesin im going to try it im going to burn a /none/ thing and see if that does it so yeah lets  find out  matt youre up next grog  taliesin right yeah thatll do 32 to hit  matt 32 hits  taliesin all right thats a d10 and d6 thats 11 points of damage and three points of psychic  damage  matt okay  taliesin and it has to make a constitution saving throw  matt it does not actually because its not affected by that effect its eyes can shift  throughout its body  taliesin theres no snapping breaking the glass  matt nope  /none/ taliesin man you made me burn a grit that sucks  matt yeah even with its spell advantage against all those sanctuary saves it just doesnt have a  very high wisdom so it just cannot make it  taliesin thats okay im going to take a sharpshooter shot at it and just keep damaging it  im going to do a sharpshooter shot  matt two more go for it  taliesin that was shot one  matt

the chains i forgot to  mention earlier as the tangling chains around it you did suffer five points of bludgeoning damage  as the chains are just swirling around and the aura and the area of its vicinity just shreds like  a slowmoving grinder  marisha as i move out  matt youre still in there  marisha but i healed okay so im at 60 points right  matt grog youre up  laura get it grog  travis

door blows open you glance inside you can see within the walls are covered in pulsey  fleshy musclelike substance with these long stretched tendons and pieces of sinew /none/ that all  gather to the center and you see this shifting larval egg and within you can see a small  humanoid figure that is swirling and writhing within it seems like its in this perpetual state  of agony screaming quietly within this weird fleshy egg sac and you can see the features of a  tigerlike face and fangs writhing inside  marisha fucking umbilical cord  travis i have one more hit ill stride forward and swing away  matt okay as you step forward the chain golem already used its reaction so it cannot you /none/ just  walk forward make an attack  travis reckless please  laura because why not  travis because

red cream as the true form of hotis partially returned is now scattered across the  steaming pavement of the depths of the mentiri prison the devil is no more you are free from  the curse  cheering  /none/ matt now just to get out of here because you hear the voices in the distance now getting  laura now we just have to plane shift  noelle what is happening  laura is it done  travis no how much movement do i have left  matt that was you because of the chains wrapping around you which by the way did five points of  bludgeoning damage to you  travis okay  matt it takes you half movement to move through that space so thats five ten 15 20 25 30 so  you can move /none/ two more squares  travis two more squares ill come back out the door and towards keyleth  matt all right thatll get you about there and thats as far as you can get the chains are  tangling you up and preventing you from moving quickly ending grogs turn taryon  sam i mean were done  laura get to keyleth we have to be
