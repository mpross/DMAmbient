none	 period of time found themselves free of immediate necessity and  danger  travis what  marisha brought peace to the world forever  matt no thats not true  marisha nothing bad will ever happen again  matt laughs thats not how this works  laughter  sam credits  matt so as the last episode wound down and friendships were strengthened you all then began  to ponder about what you wanted to do with the time before you and today we return approximately  one year after we left off so we met earlier this week to 
none	 discuss this we went through a  various number of things you wanted to accomplish both as individuals and some of you in groups so  were going to go ahead and go over those elements for you guys and get everyone up to speed with  what exactly has transpired in this year period of time  liam show and tell  matt so who would like to begin  sam were just going to share  laura just say what we did what we accomplished  liam summer vacation  matt share elements of it and then some 
none	 elements will be roleplayed because thats  what i want to do  laura because thats what i want to do  matt yeah so  travis are you pointing at me okay okay ill start  matt all right so grog what are some of the things you did  travis because i singlehandedly established peace across exandria i found myself bored in  need of action and so i sought out where the fight would now be i looked for scanlan a little  bit along the way i didnt find him  matt no you did not 
none	  travis i looked for like magical items along the way i didnt find them so i went to  vasselheim which is where the slayers take is and i think before i left i wanted to get some  personal things like done to my body so i had the bear tattoo that i filleted of off kevdak and  i had it tanned and then i got a copy of that tattoo on my back  matt yeah  travis because that shits behind me  all ooh  matt so you now have kevdaks beartotem tattoo that 
none	 was on his chest now on your back  travis yep  matt out of sheer disrespect for him  travis totes  matt i love it  liam did you get a bear ass on your bare ass  travis much better idea i also took kevdaks skull the top of it and i had a new cup a new  mug made out of it with metal bits and stuff with a handle  matt yeah yeah okay  travis i dont understand how but it looks really great its like metal and bone and i  drinking 
none	 sounds thats me  matt thats delicious  travis i just choked on a peanut  laura yeah oh grog i heard it happen  travis so i went to vasselheim and i defended my title in the crucible  matt yeah met multiple times  travis multiple times  matt including once against a familiar individual called kern the hammer  travis kern the hammer he came back with that monk shit  matt yeah and did not prevail  travis nope  matt however he did come back to you requesting to learn and train under you to 
none	 teach him your  ways to which you said  travis i forgot no yes i said yes  matt you said no  travis i said no  laughter  matt thats what you told me at least  travis i said no i said no because i was like youve got to drink all the time and this and  he just wasnt up to snuff that and i should not be teaching anyone anything so then i went to the  slayers take right in search of big game and i had fun with that for a 
tavern	 while but it just wasnt  quite the same it wasnt crazyass you know ancient dragons or nothing it just wasnt quite  up to snuff but i did have my curiosity about the deck of many things piqued so at some point  along the way vexs warnings ringing in my ears i found a nice drunk sap to  matt so so as you are wandering down an evening byway in the quadroads of vasselheim a number of  cups in yourself you hiccup loudly and glance off to the side to find one gentleman whos been far 
none	  deeper in his cups and is currently trying to steady himself against the stone wall in an  alleyway  travis yup hey you  matt what  travis you you look like a mighty warrior do you need another drink  matt oh if youre buying yeah  travis yeah i do i have one and i pour him a little bit from the keg hey do you have like a  wife kids attachments anyone that would miss you  matt you think if i did id be drinking this hard  travis im going to take 
town	 that as a no cool hey look i dont know if youre interested but i  have in my possession something really cool and i take out the deck do you know what this is  matt i have no idea  travis great great were in the street right  matt yeah youre near a thoroughfare and theres a small alley off to the side  travis good follow me into this alley and itll be a deal just follow me over here  matt make a persuasion check with advantage because hes really drunk  marisha for anyone 
none	 whos watching this is like abduction how to not 101 selfdefense  matt this is terrible  liam i mean hes either changing this guys life for the better or murdering him  travis 19 plus one  matt laughs you watch as in the center of his pupils a little sparkle of interest kicks in and  i mean five percent soberer at the prospect of something fun of this stranger that gave him a  drink and goes wait what are you talking about  travis well listen i am kind of like an evangelical spreader of good 
none	 news and i found  this and one time i pulled a card out and i got a magic weapon it was amazing and i just figured  like you look like a guy that would appreciate such a weapon so  matt belches  travis  and i open the deck i thought maybe you would like to draw a card  matt he takes a second and looks around looks at the deck is this some sort of a magic trick  travis yes yep  matt all right do you want me to tell you what it 
none	 is  travis sure yeah just draw it and actually just hold it and dont tell me what it is  matt okay let me get my cards out  laura oh my god  ashley you have an actual set  laura what the actual fuck is  happening right now  travis it was a fucking year did you not think this was going to happen  laughter  travis it probably happened in the first week  liam this is the first of ten guys  travis lot of problems lot of drinking lot of fighting ran 
none	 out of shit  sam what if you die what if you die right now  travis im not hes drawing the card  laura yeah but you could still die  sam it could kill it could kill you too  travis could it  sam i think so  travis im not really sure on how this shit works but i need another card to  come out of that deck  matt yeah maybe  laura oh my god oh no what did he pull what did he pull  matt no no no huh im going 
none	 to let somebody else pull this who wants to pull it  travis oh you raise your hand to pull from the deck thats some bullshit  laura oh no should i turn it  travis ooh ooh  laura do you know what that is  travis no i dont remember  matt okay  marisha its just it looked ominous  travis it was a face card though  taliesin it was a face card oh oh  matt laughs  laura oh no is it amazing did he get something really good  taliesin youre the dm 
none	 now  matt hold on i have to roll a die first laughs he takes the card and looks at it turns  around and shows you and its this tarot card of a beautiful moonscape with an open night sky i  believe thats what it is yeah thats what it is he puts it back in the deck and is like all  right whats the trick im im feeling a little a little strange  travis could you describe to me how you feel right now  matt and hes like trying to contemplate it he goes 
none	 wait a second  i wish that i was a powerful lord of the  quadroads  and theres a strange tingling visual image as the cloth around him that  was tattered and wornout becomes beautiful silks  laura oh my god  matt the drunkenness fades from him eversoslightly and now he looks washed and you  glance over at the far end of the alleyway and theres a guy there whos dressed in long long  tails and a coat and goes sir how long are you going to be  he goes right with you i 
none	 dont even know what  his name is well thank you so much stranger  and he pats you on the shoulder  travis grog grog  matt grog  travis grog strongjaw  matt grog strongthings  travis maker of kings  matt great  travis yup  matt i still got one more of these and he walks off and runs off to the carriage  laura he got two wishes  matt 1d3 wishes  travis are you fucking serious  sam wait he got two wishes you gave away two wishes  travis shouts wait what 
none	 was your name  matt the queen of diamonds was the card  travis did i get his name  matt you didnt get his name he just runs off  taliesin lord of the quadroads now  sam you just got a cure for cancer and you gave it away  laura wait wait i have a question once a card has been pulled is it gone from the deck or does  it go back in  liam some go back and some  laura oh my god  travis i should just pull all of these right 
none	 now  groaning  travis i mean obviously it was just a little appetizer the first one  matt well let me see here let me see let me see  travis that is way better  taliesin laughs you want to pull another one  sam matts verifying  laura verifying that he did the right thing  travis hes doublechecking  sam this is important  laura i know yeah  matt once the card is drawn it fades from existence  taliesin oh theres no other no the wish card goes  matt yeah  laura the 
none	 best card is fucking gone it is the best card isnt it  liam now the deck is slightly shittier  sam way shittier  matt but you know what  travis you know what only one person picked that card from the deck so its not really my fault  sam its lauras fault  taliesin good roll laura  laura thank you thank you hey man  matt that ones gone now  taliesin lord of the quadroads now owes you a favor  laura yeah  marisha thats true  travis it was the queen of diamonds 
none	 right yeah  ashley i say at the end of all this we all pick one  liam who was that man that was taliesin jaffe mayor of ren faire  taliesin huzzah  ashley huzzah  laura whats going on matt  matt just doublechecking to make sure the card goes away and it does according to how its  written  travis clearly nobody in my group knows what theyre talking about  this deck is a mighty gift  laura fuck  taliesin were doomed  travis and i put it back in the bag of holding 
tavern	  matt okay i was like oh god is he going to draw another card  liam twohour combat scenario  travis i want to really bad but i have an open bar tab  matt okay then you in your time away radically changed some poor mans life and apparently  wished himself to some level of nobility within the quadroads of vasselheim with one wish still  standing  laura thats amazing  travis okay  marisha remember that guy  travis lord of the crossroads quadroads  matt well there are many lords and ladies of the 
none	 quadroads hes just now one of them  travis good deal that happened  matt i was thinking to myself it was either going to be that or some grim reapers going to show up  and cut his head off  travis thats all i wanted really just cheer him on maybe have a little better counterweight  for my expectation of the deck but now i just want to pull one every day nothing but good shit  happens magic weapon fucking wishes  matt so if this happened early in your year do you still resist the 
none	 urge as the year progresses  laura oh no  travis no  laura oh jesus  taliesin yay  matt how long does it take until the urge  creeps up again  travis i mean oh god why do i have to be so fucking true to my character  taliesin theres nothing we can do  laura were not even there  liam probably thinks he has three birthdays a year right so  travis i will probably wait to take it back so that i can open it with my good friend pike  because shell 
none	 understand that this is an awesome deck  matt which actually plays into her opening the other thing you did which happens towards the end  of the year is you said you went to the frostweald  travis i did yeah i was curious about the werewolves so i went to go see the nymph in the  frozen lake you know the one thats all about grog  matt mmhm  travis so i had a conversation with her and i felt really bad because i wasnt as affectionate  as last time so i gave her this 
none	 palmsized ruby that was at the bottom of the bag looked really  pretty so i gave it to her  matt she thanked you  travis she did we hit it off and i asked her if the werewolves were just in the feywild  turns out  matt lycanthropy is scattered throughout the planes  travis well i didnt fucking know that  matt now you do she passed that information on to you all right so thats the truncated  example of grogs year we might come back to it here in a minute next up would 
none	 be pike because  thats a good transition point there so whatd you do  ashley all right so i followed in the beginning did the guy pick the deck in  vasselheim or were you  matt and travis it was in vasselheim  ashley so i went with grog to vasselheim and because i wanted to go and read and  work on some things  matt check in on your temple that you built there  ashley yes i ended up fighting laughs because i saw him fight and i was like oh i should  probably 
none	 just try it  travis yeah  ashley and did well  matt yeah  ashley im the second champion under grog  laura fuck yes  matt and as everyone was pitting both of you against each other for another championship bout  you both decided to  ashley do it no to fight  travis to kill each other  ashley we didnt end up doing it  travis nope  ashley we just shook  travis yep  ashley  and we knew both of us were just too powerful  travis too true  ashley  
none	 and i would win so we just decided not to do it  travis two monsters of a feather stay in leather  ashley two monsters of a feather also in that time which was a fivemonth period we had a lot  of lessons and taught grog how to read  laura yay  ashley just a little bit  travis just a little  matt you can slowly read four to fiveletter words  marisha fiveletter words is a big deal  laura thats a big fucking deal  matt he knows how to write his name now 
none	  laura yeah  matt and he can write a full sentence over a short rest  travis yep  laughter  travis meat cat  liam farts farts  travis doody with a y  marisha does he get exhausted from reading  matt well cross that bridge when we get to it  laughter  ashley wait what did you ask  marisha if he gets mentally exhausted from reading takes a point of exhaustion when he tries  to read  ashley im so tired  travis im tired now  ashley i took some time to 
none	 learn how to be just a little bit more stealthy  laura yeah  ashley just did a little bit of training not a ton but maybe well see i also went to check on  greatgreatgrandpappy wilhand to see how he was doing and hes doing fine hes older  matt wilhand yeah hes doing good the home that was damaged in the umbrasyl attack on  westruun your room has been repaired though its taken a little while because its mainly just him  hiring who he can at the time but hes doing well hes an old 
none	 gnome but still kicking  around still doing his best still doing his prayers to sarenrae  glad to see you coming saying hi  ashley oh of course always  marisha does he still have fassbender  ashley ive totally forgot about fassbender didnt he die  laura no no no we left fassbender with him  ashley oh shit i forgot about fassbender  sam no i thought that we lost him in the dragon fight  laura no no no we left him with wilhand  ashley hes keeping him safe he probably helped build the house 
none	  matt if you ask him about that ask him where fassbender is hes like oh this nice older  fella came by and said it was his property so i gave it back to him he seemed very  laura it was that dick  matt  very intent on receiving his property and i wasnt about to argue  ashley thats okay  laura he was technically his  ashley it was technically his i also sent a little bit of money to  i dont know where they  are but i hired somebody to send a

none	 day you returned with various foods and meat and trying to connect  with it and did not succeed  laura i did not i failed miserably  liam so many shit rolls  laura so many shit rolls  matt yeah it fled southward into the parchwood and while you now have sent your grey hunt that is  now working below you to keep an eye out for it it has not been seen since  laura yes i am on the lookout in case it comes close to our territory i want to keep our people  
none	 safe but im not going to go and try to kill it just for the shits  matt yeah  laura yeah i also built my house  matt mmhm  laura yes new house new house and built up the guard and i made a nice little animal sanctuary  for trinket a nice garden area for him to hang out in and other wildlife should they so desire  oh and tary tary moved in  sam i didnt have a place to stay  laura and i have such a large house you might as well just

none	 within your estate in whitestone and at  the end of the year its still two weeks out from creation so its going to take a little while  longer but it is in the process  laura trying to make amends to make peace with my father trying to forgive and grow and move on  and while tary was living in the house  sam braiding hair  laura oh my gosh just doing so many things we decided to make armor out of vorugal so i have  new white dragon leather armor that tary helped me 
none	 enchant actually that tary enchanted and i hung  out with him for five months while he did that  matt yeah  sam yeah that happened  laughter  sam a lot of hard work but i learned something from it  laura yeah that im really good company basically  sam yeah yep she knows two songs she sings them all the time  laughter  laura and trinket gives amazing massages  sam thats true  laura yes i think thats pretty much it outside of the bakery which has taken up a lot of time  
none	 really  matt yeah you did also research some  laura yes i spent a fuckton of time im building up my library in the house so i spent a  lot of time researching orcus and the raven queen and learning everything that i can about all of  them all of them  matt all right and vax  liam everythings going to start to get a little intertwined here now  matt which is why i led it along this way so yeah  liam yeah yeah so overarching theme is there was a lot of zephra 
none	 and chill  laughter  liam enjoyed not being on deaths door every fucking day and relaxing and being the right hand  of the queen back in zephra and  marisha chief  liam im still learning the lingo getting to know korren a bit more keyleth helped me i let  a lot of blood and made a small altar to the raven queen in zephra and its been all flowered and  vined out and while we spent most of our time oh tattoos want to talk tattoos  marisha yeah since keyleth the mantles a little 
dung	 heavy and flashy and a little formal to  wear all the time but wanted something to still represent my chiefdom  sam did you get antlers tattooed on your face  laughter  matt just right there  laura ooh that actually could be pretty tight like those elves in dragon age  marisha keyleth goes hard yeah no i got the traditional ashari tattoos of the mantle across  her chest and shoulders to mimic that  laura thats super tight  liam we went together yours took much longer than mine did yeah  marisha it took 
dung	 a while its old needleandhammer style all traditional  liam yeah and about twothirds of the way through yours they started on mine which is just  a pair of antlers on the right bicep here  marisha see he got the antlers  sam nice  laura oh did you really  liam i did not on my face  laura oh thats great thats so cute  matt right next to the barbed wire  liam yeah keyleth for life so we spent a lot of time in zephra but since havedruidwilltravel  we met up with these 
none	 two quite a bit about once a month we would have three or fourday weekends  wed spent time in whitestone we went to vasselheim a lot the twins spent a lot of time in  the library  laura yes we did  liam reading a ton i spent a lot of time at the raven queens temple getting to know the people  there getting to know what the hell a cleric or a priest or a paladin of the raven queen does since  i didnt really have any time to do that  matt part of 
none	 your process there once you had been fully accepted into the order there some of  the few responsibilities you had were you were called whenever relatively important figures in  the city had passed away to go and give rites when they were interred and be present during a  number of funerals in there that was one of the earlier responsibilities that was given to you  within vasselheim while you were there  liam i tried to do a little observing too in zephra as well i didnt want to interfere with  their customs but its 
none	 like working at a funeral home and over time you just get used to it a couple  of bits and pieces i saw everybody really i went on a mans weekend with grog and killed  things that was awesome talked a lot of shop with pike god talk the girls went off on their  own a little bit so i spent time trying to figure out what it was percival does in his workshop he  lent me a book about the history of whitestone  taliesin i did i also sent you on a tour of 
none	 the frescoes it was quite nice  liam its beautiful once youre not screaming running on fire you can really take in art and  pass notes  taliesin it had been years since id done it without being on fire running around yes  liam also tried to locate dr dranzel in an effort to find scanlan but was unsuccessful  matt yes  travis you ate raw meat with me  liam yeah and kept it down  travis you did like a champ  sam do you like me check this box  liam are we married 
none	 yes or no  laughter  taliesin check one carry on carry on  liam oh and last thing vex took me to syngorn on one of her trips spent some time with little  sis not as much time with dad some time with dad were all right  laura eh its whatever  liam its fine  matt yeah youve arranged a respect there is no familial bond per se with him but a lot of the  tension has died away and there is a business positive interaction  laura yeah theres finally this feeling that we 
none	 dont need at least for me his approval  anymore which is very nice  matt no and he acknowledges that and he seems both simultaneously proud and sad almost a mild  regret that perhaps i think he realizes now what he missed out on  laura how fucking cool we are  matt kind of  sam well you were until that  laughter  laura just so fucking cool thanks for the note  liam in character in character you know elfs going to elf and theres  no getting around that so  matt exactly all 
none	 righty and i think im to marisha as keyleth keyleth  what you got going on  marisha okay so once again lot of intertwining starting to go on got our tattoos took a little  bit of time one of the big things that keyleth did over the course of the year which took a  massive majority of her time was she went on a diplomacy mission to all four of the tribes as  well as emon and whitestone and with the help of percy and tary we came up with a system that we  are 
none	 calling the crisis orbs system is what you called it where we put magical orbs in each of  the cities that are basically giant panic beacons and each city got assigned a separate color to  where if anything goes terribly wrong someone can hit that beacon and all of the crystals will light  up and whoever can respond first will do so  matt yeah  travis what if some shitty 11yearold kid just runs up and hits it  matt they are heavily under guard  travis oh smart thinking  sam by a 12yearold  
none	 marisha its like how calling 911 is illegal you dont do that you dont do that  taliesin youre not allowed in that room laughs  marisha yes cause keyleth does definitely keyleth and a lot of the other ashari dealt with a  little bit of guilt after cinderking thordak and wanted to make sure that if anything tragically  goes wrong again we can potentially be faster to respond and have allies nearby so that was a  massive part of it i also went to whitestone and grabbed a little sprig off of the sun tree to

none	 history wow  laura yeah it was like a whole new way to tell history it was just so good  matt laughs so after searching for a few days up northward in the forest where you recall seeing  portions of the tree canopy line shifting and seemingly vanishing and then reappearing you  eventually stumbled upon a large wooden structure circular and tall almost like a giant  crown of wood it sat there and noticed that the mists that hugged the base of this marsh as its  slowly recovering since sondur fell still thick marshland but 
none	 not quite as disgusting and corrupt  as it once was the mists that clouded this area were all gathering towards this wooden structure  and you begin to see shapes in the mist heads faces bodies and you begin to realize that these  were all spirits of the marsh being summoned to this structure you all went disguised as various  small flying insects or beast creatures and managed to stealth into the entrance doors into  this mossy marshrotted wood structure and on the inside saw the mist form an audience within the  inside of this 
none	 globe theatrelike structure upon which the central platform remained a strange  crystalline spark began to form upon that stage where a doorway opened and then stepping from it  a halfdozen elvishlooking figures though their skin is pale whitegray their eyes white and  irisless their limbs lithe and thinner and longer than elves youre used to seeing in your  experience and while none of you could understand or most of you could understand the  language except for keyleth and taryon i think it was  marisha no we were the ones that could  matt yeah 
none	 you guys were the only ones who could understand it because you both knew sylvan  marisha correct  matt what you saw was a brilliant threeact performance for the undead spirits of the  surrounding marsh unaware of the serious danger if any of you had been discovered laughs  liam do tell matt  laura yeah i know i want to know  matt no you dont know  liam aliens  matt go back go back however you watched the performance entirely did not gather their  attention at which the entity stepped back into a doorway 
none	 and it closed off and you absconded from  the theatre before the rest of the audience could shift its way out and become the mists of the  forests once again  liam this is their most sacred ceremony or something  matt you dont know  liam i dont  matt you only know what they told you  taliesin you only have what i told you later its pretty much  matt yeah so as you guys returned from this and described your experience to percy the only person  who really had spent a large portion 
none	 of his youth researching the feywild and having an interest in  these fey creatures and their societies  laura he didnt want to go yeah he had things to copy  taliesin i had things to do i wasnt entirely clear about what you were planning to do my god  marisha sorry  taliesin no its great you didnt die you werent kidnapped  your soul wasnt taken you werent  laura that couldve happened  taliesin yes you watched the  marisha the royal troupe of the  taliesin and marisha unseelie court  taliesin for gods 
none	 sakes yes a lot couldve happened they have these little vignettes on  occasion that they use to sort of its like a nice little trap they just like to grab people  and use them for various things no one really knows because no one ever comes back  liam who are they the unseelie court  taliesin theyre sort of the shadow court i suppose they would be the for everything that  you saw in the feywild they are the thing that the feywild is a little sketchy about and a little  worried about  laura 
none	 ooh  liam well listen man if i cant have the arts in my life id rather be dead  taliesin i respect that  laughter  taliesin and im very impressed youre going to have to draw everything youre going to have to  draw everything its very important  liam they looked like slendermen  taliesin i dont know what that means  laura very tall and slender  sam they kept singing about a technicolor dreamcoat  laughter  taliesin i have a book about that  laughter  matt all right so your adventure to finally

none	 of what the future of mankind could be and the first order of business  one of two big projects that weve started to bring forth our reputation as this modern city is  weve been running steam pipes from the depths through the main streets so that the snow never  needs to be uncovered so that the streets are always clean and a few of the major houses can be  heated this way during the heavy winters  matt its a heavy endeavor its going to take a while to complete  taliesin its not completed yet

none	  as you walk inside theres one woman whos sitting there in the process of eating a small  bowl of fruit you see she is a darkskinned marquesian but elf lineage she has elven  features her hair which is this dirty brown is braided in rows that go down past her waist and  have a series of multicolored looks almost like gems and rings and other cool pieces of jewelry  that are woven into it as shes looking at this small book in her lap and eating the fruit she  turns around oh im sorry 
none	 hello  ashley hi could we get our hair yours looks amazing could we get some hair braids tight and  then going down with some gems and sparkles in it and same here on his beard  matt oh the beard i can do that  ashley yeah  matt yes of course closes her book and sets it down come sit  laura some razor blades up in them  matt she calls out in marquesian for a moment and a younger woman probably about 15 or so  comes out human darkskinned as well both begin to 
none	 start working on your hair and your  beard asking about where youre from it becomes a conversational piece because youre there for a  good hour and a half or so to go through all of your hair and get it done but nevertheless you  now have a fantastic series of braids in your hair  travis she pulled really hard  ashley it looks really good do you want to add any jewels in it  travis jewels  ashley earrings and stuff like how she has  travis i just want the beads little beads and 
dung	 little braids no jewels what about you  ashley i want all of it  travis everything  ashley just all of it  matt all of it  ashley what does all of it cost  matt if you want more than what i have in mine  ashley well no lets not get carried away  travis do you want extensions  ashley my hair is already so long  travis it is do you want other colored hair in there too  ashley lets put blue in there  matt oh you wish to color  ashley 
none	 oh well  matt no its okay  travis yeah why not fuck it  matt she talks to her assistant and the young girl runs off for a second with a smile comes  back and there is what looks to be some sort of a fruit looks like a blue pomegranate thats  partially crushed she takes it and with a mortar and pestle setup begins mashing it and goes  we can do blue  ashley yeah  travis yeah  laura so cool  matt the whole endeavor between the two of you guys is not 
none	 inexpensive few things are in the  bay of gifts its designed specifically to survive and thrive on the trade here both of you  guys it costs about 120 gold  marisha oh shit  travis not a problem  ashley so how does that break down for my hair versus his  matt oh for the two for any sort of masculine hair endeavors which is not our specialty well  the beads themselves are made from finely blown glass and theyre individually colored and those  are made specifically by an artisan who is about three blocks 
none	 up that way so those are brought  here and those are purchased on our end as well you are paying straight cost of the beads time  and training of course on our end and we do the finest work youll find all across marquet  ashley well you know what i am a very big supporter of small businesses so support small  business and i will give you 120 gold  matt the 20 is mainly for him the 100 was to give you the dye coloring  laura oh its for both of you guys oh 
none	 i thought it was 120 each  liam thats all right  laura thats not bad i mean thats a lot  matt its still a lot but since youve gotten here you get the sense that its by nature  everything here costs a little more a lot of its imported and a lot of it is designed for people  that are willing to pay for foreign goods  ashley great  travis are we supposed to tip  laura no she owns the business so you dont have to do as much  travis are you there 
none	  ashley just 120  matt very well so how much blue did you want to get in your hair  ashley say again  matt how much blue did you want to get in your hair  ashley just some strips you know just some strips on the white so it pops out  matt okay  ashley just like  matt all right  ashley you know dealers choice just get creative and do what you want  matt all right okay so upon completion its very cool its pretty close to what you were  hoping and 
none	 expecting you end up with three streaks one central one that goes from the  center and then two that go from the sides and back that way  laura thats way different than i expected  ashley its awesome  matt and then all the tips go to blue so its almost like you have these two blocks of white and  then eventually it all goes blue towards the edge  ashley and travis yeah  laura imagine what thatll look like when your hair is down too because itll be like blue all  over the top 
none	 and all mixed in everywhere  ashley ooh thats pretty cool  travis hell yeah  matt so yeah anything else you want to accomplish or call it an evening  laura i think just eat a nice dinner and then head back to the rooms and get ready to wake up in  the morning and do all the same shit again  marisha definitely some magically frozen daiquiris  matt you guys all find your way back with some drinks the sun has set now the cold night has  come in through the bay but its still

none	 card deck that can alter  reality in good and bad ways thats as much as you are able to glean from this  ashley can i tell which cards are good and which cards are bad  matt no  ashley i was just checking  laughter  ashley i figured the answer would be no  matt but you do know from looking at this while the name doesnt come to you youre able to  ascertain this seems to be very very in line with the fatealtering deck of cards the one youve  heard can do 
none	 good and bad and is as powerful and dangerous as it is interesting  ashley i feel like ive heard of something like this before  travis really  ashley but sometimes you can choose a card that will do very bad things  travis oh  ashley so its like a 5050 chance that you could get something very good like you have your  fortune change you become a king all of this thing  travis or you make a bad person a king  ashley or you get a magical sword or if maybe someone you could 
none	 just die instantly  travis really  ashley i dont know maybe something along those lines  travis but were good people so good things would happen to us  ashley strained oh it just sounds so fun though  travis i know right and think about my previous experience there is nothing bad that has happened  in what ive seen so far  laura laughs oh god  ashley strained oh i dont know what to do well do you want to pull one or should i pull  one or should we not  travis i dont 
none	 know i mean like i kind of want to i mean so like like bad things  ashley what could be that bad i mean if someone were to die we could do a resurrection spell  travis how could it just outright kill you well if you die i cant do a spell  ashley sighs i dont know what to do i dont know if we should i dont know if we should test  the fates  travis we should flip a coin  ashley lets flip a coin  travis okay do you have a coin

town	 buildings that line the square have little flower boxes  underneath the windows color has returned to it still keeps moody gray skies a large portion of  the day but overall the city itself seems to have sprung into life over the past year or so the sun  tree is beautiful its still a vastly barkvisible tree it has that orangebrown color  across it smooth in most places a little more textured toward the bottom but you see the very  lush green leaves up into the boughs you can see little bits of white flowers that

none	 tonight lets see what happens oh thats good thats much better  straight perception 30  matt okay as youre walking away from the sun tree and begin heading back to the northern side  of whitestone glancing back at him oh its good to talk to him again and you see pike  walking with two guards just on the southwestern side of the square she looks a little nervous  marisha its about that time im like okay bye sun tree and then im going to beast shape into a  crow and start circling her  matt 
town	 there are two kids off to the side that were just playing who look over and go whoa  laura that was amazing  ashley that was awesome  matt i want to do that  marisha poop on the way up  laura that was even cooler  matt they did not see that so as youre brought to the western road it leads you alongside the  shops and one of the guard whos talking to you is like yeah sorry a group of folks have been  here for a couple of days asking a few hours 
town	 i should say not a couple of days asking about  you weve kept an eye on them they dont seem to be aggressive but they asked for you recently  and we managed to find you by the bakery here they are they lead you to the outside of the  town and there you see a small carriage with two horses that are currently hitched up front you  see about three other pale guard in full armor one of them is in the middle of conversation with  a couple of figures you see four figures you 
dung	 see three and then a fourth one emerges from inside  the carriage its a topped carriage with what looks to be some sort of curtains that are closed reds  and dark purples it doesnt look like an elaborate carriage but its functional  you see a male gnome with short dark hair slicked to one side and a wellgroomed mustache that  curls at the end hes in the middle of talking when he glances over and sees you and goes aha  shes here he leaps off the top and the guards get defensive as he goes 
none	  astra ogden jb shes here  then he goes rushing off in your direction as the guards are like sir sir  he ignores them for a second and the two guards with you say miss pike should we and they go  for their blades  ashley its okay  matt he approaches real fast and goes laughs and gives a big old hug and lifts you off the  ground and it takes you a minute to realize this is johann trickfoot your cousin who you havent  seen in quite a long time hes dressed in 
dung	 a fine vest that is a dark maroon color with a gold trim  a little ragged at the edges but fine big swishy pants and boots and he lifts you up for a  second and then sets you back down and is like its been quite a while  ashley its been so long how did you know where to find me  matt well we got your letter and weve been hearing all about you at least jbs been  telling us all about you hasnt she and he looks around and you  see the other 
none	 figures as they approach  theres a female gnome older than you who you havent met before who has curly  strawberryblonde hair that goes just past her shoulders shes wearing this very revealing shirt  and seems to walk with a confidence and smile and she goes pike my dear  ive heard all about you and she rushes up and  gives you a big hug as well  you look back and stepping off the carriage you see a very old gnome who is just a wreath of black  and saltandpepper hair crazy around him like 
none	 a lions mane and a giant beard you wouldnt see a  face if not for these small spectacles and a little button nose poking out as hes being helped  off the wagon by another female gnome that you recognize as she turns around towards you she has  long straight black hair that goes right past her shoulders she has a wednesday addams vibe to her  she looks back at you and smiles and you can see this gap in her front teeth shes about your age  this is jb trickfoot she is the  marisha 
none	 jb  matt jb shes another one of your cousins one that you grew up with actually when you were  very young but you havent seen her in a very long time as they all begin to approach this  small cluster of trickfoots have approached as jb walks up to answer johann says yes indeed  weve heard all about you ive been so proud to hear that youve done such great good in the  world cousin  ashley i give her a hug its good to see you its been a very long time  matt 
none	 far too long  ashley did you guys just come here to see me  matt yes  johann claps his arm on the side of your shoulder yes of course its been i cant even  remember look at how big you are last i saw you you were waisthigh to a knucklepunch its been  far too long and so strong hes slapping the side of your arm and theyre all doing the whole  family gathering pulling and tugging and youre starting to feel uncomfortable from all the  attention and the guards are all confused but 
none	 also mildly amused by this family gathering  the old one now catches up and you recognize that this is your uncle ogden trickfoot who is the  father to both johann and jb as he approaches he has this small walking cane and hes walking at an  angle because he doesnt quite see you hes like are you sure that shes around  ashley im right here  matt huh  ashley hi  matt ah yes  ashley how are you  matt im all right its so good to see you  ashley its so wonderful

dung	 then laughs oh this place is amazing do you smell that you smell that uncle  and you watch as the uncle comes in sniffs smells like rocks  sam rocks  matt he lost his smell when he was very it was a terrible accident horse hoof in the face  anyway hi were family of pike trickfoot and we were told to come here and try your wares so this  is a bakery  sam in gnomish welcome to the store any family of pike trickfoot is family of mine i am one of  her closest

none	 you find out that i was here  matt johann and astra turn their heads to jb and jb goes well im keeping tabs on what youve  been doing there had been word that you not only helped with the reconstruction of emon but youve  also been traveling to and from whitestone since the conclave attacked the continent so we  narrowed it down between a few possibilities and based on the fact that you percival this is  your city is that correct we figured that given that basis we had a good chance we passed

none	  they stop them from doing anything too terrible more to the point that they just write it down and  report it immediately  laughter  taliesin unless anyones doing something terrible or going somewhere they really  shouldnt  matt right okay that information is easily distributed throughout the pale guard  without issue  liam i guess that silverware wasnt so important  taliesin oh were bringing out the moderate silverware  ashley thats a good idea thats a great idea  laura all the good silver is hidden hidden up high  matt because there are 
none	 only within the castle at any given time four baths four rooms that  contain full baths occasionally you have to wait for a person but they immediately scatter three  of them are taken  ashley okay we might have to wait a little bit  matt you wait a while eventually they one by one start making their way down to the main  banquet hall of the castle cleaned up you watch as johann comes down wearing his same clothing  that appears to have been cleaned wow im appreciative that you have servants here that can 
none	  do such a nice job with such fine family threads his mustache is done perfectly his hair is still  slick and wet from the bath combed over well thank you its in the blood  ashley chuckles it sure is  matt he turns around astra whats taking her so long walks back out to the stairway and  rushes past the guards his little gnomish head dodging by their knees almost he goes  shouting astra  you hear a voice go shouting im almost done wait and be patient  he goes back shell be down 
none	 in a moment dont worry in the meantime  is there an appetizer course  ashley sure why dont you take a seat and order whatever you want on me  matt youre so generous he pinches your cheek he waltzes over to the table sits down and grabs  the fork and knife two bottles of red and ooh what vintage have you he begins talking  with the servants about what various wines are available  laura im just going to pop into the kitchen  matt okay  laura and tell the staff in the kitchen obviously

none	 you asked  sam this is not what i asked for  ashley this is comfort food in whitestone  taliesin we thought we would give you the cornucopia of our experience  laura i take a big spoon of peanut butter  matt johann gives a curious eye and goes well who are we to scoff at the cultures of others  lets dig in everyone and immediately he goes in astra begins eating as well jb takes a bite  and then prepares a bite for uncle ogden who is in the process of staring at the table 
none	 strangely  eventually the spoon finds its way there  taliesin well thats the next 30 minutes  matt as this is happening johann begins asking questions so this is your castle  ashley is this my castle  matt jb is like no its not her castle its his castle shes just staying here for now  taliesin technically its my sisters castle but certainly  matt at which point cassandra comes in from the back arms crossed she wanders in brother  taliesin thats code yes  matt everything all right brother  taliesin yes fine  matt

none	 have so much to catch up on its been a long time  ashley is there someone in vox machina that you really love  matt she looks around theres this long awkward pause as she keeps looking over vox machina again  and again but not making any eye contact with grog and eventually goes  i suppose lady vexahlia hands the spoon  over to you  ashley okay well im sure she would love to talk to you shes very inviting very friendly  matt should i just go sit  ashley sure  matt okay she 
none	 gets up from the table johanns still talking hes telling stories we  trickfoots for generations weve been problemsolvers we rove from place to place  solving problems across the countrysides if you have a squeaky wheel we fix the wheel if you  have a squeaky door we fix the door  travis amazing  matt if you have a squeaky tax man we fix the tax man thats a joke thats a joke you can  laugh see there you are  travis they kill the tax man  sam everybody hates taxes  matt as this conversations 
none	 happening theres a small bowl of what looks to be some of the pork  but its been soaked in some water or wine and its been mashed or prechewed youre not quite  sure but you have the spoon there and you have uncle ogden sitting there going  ashley i start speaking to him in underdark because i havent spoken that in a while ogden  how are you liking traveling with everybody with johann and astra and jb  matt his ear perks up a little bit and he goes i havent heard that talk in a 
none	 long time his  head turns slightly towards you but hes still looking off a little bit from under the glasses  sam is this undercommon  ashley underdark  sam underdark  matt it would be considered undercommon  ashley its undercommon okay  sam im listening  laura im reading their lips  matt do you understand undercommon okay then yeah he looks back and goes its been travel  they take care of me were here now his hand reaches over and grabs your hand and holds it for  a second he goes were here now

none	 good one  his hand releases your hand he drools a little bit and wipes it with his hand  laughter  ashley i take a spoon of peanut butter its a little bit easier here you go  sam like mr ed  ashley yep  matt it dribbles out a little bit unexpected  ashley sorry the mix between the pork and peanut butter its an interesting mix  but its grogs favorite  matt its good  ashley its a good mix  matt you see him smiling now  ashley can you tell me about astra 
none	 how did she come into the picture  matt astra met johann about ten years ago he needed someone to nail him down spry wily prone  to terrible choices hes a stupid boy stupid stupid boy  at which point johann whos been talking stops and goes in undercommon  i can hear you dad anyway  shes good to him if she breaks his heart ill kill her  ashley there you go and any word from my family my mother anything its been a long time since i  talked to them  matt they absconded east

none	 be on your guard dear  ashley okay i will check your pockets  laura always  matt she sits down next to you and begins asking about i cant believe that you stepped into the  same ridiculousness that wilhand did and its brought you all this  we just thought he was an old coot  ashley well hes all ive known and hes wonderful hes my family since i left and im  sorry i havent really contacted you guys  matt its all right we make ourselves scarce on purpose  ashley yeah well so youve 
none	 been taking care of ogden  matt weve been helping out but mostly me yeah  ashley has he told you anything that he dreams about  matt you can see that she stiffens up a little bit so hes already told you  ashley yes  matt i dont want to ruin an evening thats going so well but hes had visions im worried  about you when we got your letter that we didnt know how to find you we didnt think that  you were in the area when your letter found us we thought maybe you 
none	 werent that far away so we  began to search our way along the silver cut  ashley okay can i insight check her again  matt yeah go for it  ashley i cant figure out whats going on ugh balls oh wait 16  matt shes hard to read in general even when she was a kid she was an odd duck she seems  genuine  ashley okay well hows everybody feeling are you tired are you full is it bedtime whats  going on  sam i could talk to these people all night long  
none	 ashley well  sam but if we should turn in  matt you see astra whos been drinking deep of one of the two fine bottles of red wine is  drunkenly leaning with her arm around johanns arm hes a little tipsy but hes still in  conversation talking to grog hes telling embarrassing story after embarrassing story and  since youre so eager and no one else really wants to pay him as much mind hes talking to the  table but hes mainly focusing on you  travis yeah  matt as you begin helping ogden who 
none	 as you grab his arm hes shaking and he has his cane as he  moves along his skin is very loose  laura ogden would you like me to help carry you or are you all right to walk  matt i can walk under my own power  laura of course you can feel free to lean on me though  matt at the stairs  laura all right  matt hes still looking off as soon as you get to the stairs he gets about two steps and has to  stop and breathe and another two 
town	 stairs  laura i put my arm down so he can put as much weight as he wants  matt he leans into it and you eventually help him up the staircase that spirals up to the second  floor and eventually lead him to his chambers  laura all right and i start talking to him on the way to his room in undercommon and ask him  how long have you guys been on the road  matt always  laura always  matt by nature we dont really put down roots big old smile as he says 
dung	 roots darkened some  broken teeth heinous smell  laura peanut butter and pork  matt yep  laura i couldnt help but overhear you talking to pike about dreams youve been having  matt yes dreams  laura what kind of dreams  matt terrible premonitions  laura like what  matt at this point he stops and looks up towards you as youre holding his arm and he reaches up  and pulls the glasses shakily from the front of his face and through his small dark brown beady  eyes you see the whites at the sides 
none	 are bloodshot he glances up and goes  the kinds of dreams that end a bloodline  laura well that sounds terrible  matt were trying to find a way to stop it  laura well thats good i would like to stop it as well we all love pike very much  matt good then we came at the right time  laura can i insight check him  matt go for it  laura that was almost 21 21  sam whispers  laura yes  sam so taliesin whats the v whats the v on this shirt 
none	  taliesin the v on this shirt  liam its a book  taliesin that looks to be a tome of some sort  sam who is represented by a book  liam the whole top row is reserved for matthew  sam oh okay and whats the m in machina  taliesin it appears to be some sort of very naturalistic bow and arrow  sam who would that correspond to  taliesin scanlan i imagine  sam oh yeah that makes sense and the a  taliesin the a appears to be a birds mask and a pistol 
none	  sam also scanlan  taliesin also scanlan  sam yeah sure and the c  taliesin the c is some sort of natural wooden crest of some kind  liam thats grog taint  sam oh  taliesin in fact this is entirely grog and scanlan which i think its about time  laura well ogden are you all right getting into your bed do you need any help with that  matt if you can get me to the edge of it i can manage  laura well of course i hope you know that were here for 
dung	 you with whatever you need as long as  were all here to help pike we love her like family as well  matt good she can use some family  laura yes dark tidings  matt dark tidings indeed  laura are we talking like falling into a pit or are we talking like im going to walk him to the  bed and maybe like  matt raspy grunt he gets up and leans the stick off to the side and it thudding noise  onto the ground  laura ill crouch down and start untying his little 
dung	 boots  matt thats all right i can get that  laura i dont mind  matt he leans back and lets you do it  laura what kind of dark things are we talking  matt theres a legend in the trickfoots every generation one is born with the blood curse one  that carries with it the anger of someone slighted when we first became trickfoots maybe its  superstition but every one of these individuals died a horrible painful death screaming of a  shadow that came for them its a myth i know but these dreams 
dung	 are real and id rather be  careful and wrong than careless and right  laura do you see the shadow in your dreams  matt shapeless dark eyes like burning coals  laura does that sound like the smoke demon that we saw come out of percy anything like that  matt shapeless black shadow with red eyes sounds similar but orthax was generally black smoke had  form and the eyes were more of a yellow  taliesin the john doe of demons really  laura all right how long have you been having these dreams  matt 
none	 months  laura have you ever witnessed it happen before have you had the dreams about anyone else  matt only once i was very young  laura and they died  matt my brother  laura really  matt theobold  laura and do you know who it is the trickfoots slighted in this myth  matt i dont know this whole family is paranoid and guards their secrets from each other  anyway  laura i wish you a dreamless sleep and hes out  laughter  liam random question do we see an obvious family resemblance with 
none	 pike and any of them  matt make a perception check  sam they all have a giant birthmark on their face  laughter  liam 24  matt as youve been paying attention to them most of dinner mannerisms everything there are some  similarities  liam facial features i mean  matt yeah theyre not direct family theyre cousins uncle theyre once removed from her  central nuclear family but you do see similarities in cheekbone structure at least with  johann ogden and jb moreso with jb its hard with the mustache with johann but there are 
none	 some  similarities between jb and pike and you cant help but envision these two cute little gnome  children playing together these two darkhaired female gnomes running around and there may have  been an age when they could have been hard to tell apart from each other  laura ooh  sam swapped at birth  laura i know right  marisha freaky friday  ashley oh man okay  matt as johann picks up astra anyway its been a fantastic meal i appreciate your hospitality  and i look forward to this grand tour you promised tomorrow 
none	  travis oh yeah anything you want to see as long as youve got more of those stories  matt oh ive got loads  taliesin im going to sneak next to jb really quickly  matt okay  taliesin if you want a more proper and private tour of the city consider the offer open just  think about where youd want to start the offer does stand though have a good evening  matt as you say this to her she glances back and says very well under the needs of being  upfront as well i want 
none	 you to know that im not interested  laughter  travis thank you thats what it totally sounded like  laura it did sound like you were fucking flirting  travis you want a proper tour of deez nuts  laughter  taliesin i dont think hes figured out what shes talking about  matt i dont think he has either no  taliesin oh im sorry i thought that maybe youd want to see the and the oh  very well then  matt she looks over at grog and goes perhaps a tour is in order but just 
none	 no  im not interested  taliesin in the tour  matt in the tour yes  taliesin oh yeah i mean no yes no  laughter  liam smooth as butter  matt she gets up and walks away good night everyone good night pike  taliesin how did she do that  matt eventually all the gnomes have left and youre all there dumbfounded  at the dinner table  laura i come back down  ashley check your pockets check your pockets  laura i had no valuables on me at all  sam i have everything 
none	 that i own on me am i missing anything  laura i check my hair to make sure my brooch is still in it  marisha i check my pouch and make sure my antlers are still there  matt you guys scan through pat yourselves down everythings in place  sam i think theyre lovely  marisha and i liked seeing you being bested regardless of the people its still fun seeing  you being bested  taliesin cheap shot at best  liam you are very different from them  ashley yes  liam they are quirky  
none	 laura i mean youre quirky  ashley yeah but i mean i havent seen them in a very long time since i was but a kid  liam why did pompom take you out of there  ashley well because he was different and had a different life plan and because he became a cleric  and was the first of i dont know how far back i dont even know  liam and older than all of them  ashley yeah and he saw that i was and decided we left he took me when i was little and 
none	 we  left there was a lot that happened but i didnt know where they were because they travel  liam they just got here but whats your feel on this  ashley i dont know i heard some things with some discussions i had tonight and i need to  figure out if theyre true or not well figure out in the next few days  just to see whats going on  sam this dream that the old one talked about does that worry you  ashley how do you know about that  liam you dont know 
none	 that  laura he does he was listening in  liam oh thats right  laura i actually talked to him a little bit about that as well  ashley you did  laura yeah  taliesin a dream what dream  ashley what did he say  laura he said that there was a thing in your family a blood curse he seemed honest enough  when he was saying it said that people paid the price for a slight someone made a long time ago  and certain members of your family are cursed and hes had these 
none	 premonitions these dreams before  it was his brother who passed away a long time ago  ashley yes this is a thing  laura have you heard about this  matt you havent because you havent been with most of the trickfoots for most of your life  ashley okay  matt youve been with wilhand since you were very young you said six hes not been eager to talk  about the family you can see he resents the trickfoot clan so you havent heard of this  but you also know very little about them  laura 
none	 wilhand never discussed it with you  marisha no premonitions of a curse from wilhand  ashley he didnt talk about the family he wanted to be separate from them and he didnt want me to  be influenced by them at all  marisha hang on i dont mean to question everything but wilhand defected from the whole  family and became a cleric but he never mentioned anything of a curse why did he become a cleric  taliesin i see your reasoning  marisha that seems like a dichotomy there  taliesin it actually makes perfect sense 
none	 to me  travis he likes helping people  marisha or hes terrified of some superstitious curse maybe both  ashley maybe both  liam we trust you and wilhand raised you so wilhand must have his head screwed on straight  taliesin im going to say youre in a room of people who were raised by at least 60 percent of  the time ridiculous people who have their head screwed on straight  marisha thats accurate  laura maybe we should ask him about it  liam thats where i was going is there any merit in trying 
none	 to get a hold of wilhand right now while  theyre here  ashley can we from here  matt hes in westruun right now it is also late in the evening  marisha i can get us anywhere very quickly  sam tomorrow we should go visit him  laura yeah  liam yeah i dont think theyre going to burn down the castle  laura maybe while theyre taking a tour we bamf to westruun for just a minute  taliesin i dont necessarily know if do you want to bamf or do you just want to talk 
none	 we can  probably just talk to him or maybe we could have him sent for  liam do you remember our conversations with wilhand when we were in westruun  taliesin yeah  liam they were a little squirrely  taliesin im a little worried about leaving them here unattended  laura some of us can stay  marisha i think it would be a halfandhalf situation  laura split the party  all split the party  ashley we could as you guys know wilhand is a little hes in his older years  laura well try to 
none	 keep it quick  ashley but we could try to keep it quick  laura in and out ask him a few questions  marisha and wilhand is the brother of ogden  laura no  liam no hes older than that  matt yeah wilhand is older than ogden  marisha wilhands older than ogden  ashley wilhands older than ogden  marisha i thought ogden was as old as life itself  travis no ogden did a lot of drugs when he was younger  laura ogdens had a hard life  sam hes got to be at 
none	 least 150 or 200 years old  matt ogden looks like hes older but his physicality is not based on age as much as its  based on  marisha he had a mick jagger lifestyle  matt something akin to that i guess youd say  marisha all right  taliesin or at least a tom waits one  matt yeah  ashley lets circle back tomorrow  marisha all right  ashley and while theyre doing the tour maybe we can pop over real quick and i think that would be  better than him seeing them here 
none	  liam even as an outsider that seems a little ugh  ashley yeah  taliesin grog youll take the loud ones tomorrow and ill take the quiet ones  travis wait what i thought i get them all  taliesin do you want to get them all  travis yeah dont they want all to be on my tour  laura maybe you could do the tour together  marisha maybe you could do a grog tour and then a percy tour  liam or you could assist grog  taliesin because you asked so nicely also i was 
none	 thinking the carpet might be a fine way of moving  them around the city  laura oh that is actually a wonderful idea  ashley they would be pretty fascinated by that  laura quite distracted  liam you know the grand poobah needs an assistant  travis oh perhaps  liam its only befitting of your station that percival aid you in such a fashion  travis yes quite  marisha the two masters of the city of course  travis my history of the city is unrivaled  taliesin i will definitely agree that there are sections 
none	 of this city i would absolutely agree  that you are the master of at this point  travis thank you  laughter  taliesin sighs its going to be a lot of brothels and bars  marisha and this was my first hookup and this was the scene of my second hookup  travis yeah this is a big tree  matt im excited for this  taliesin i am so excited for this  matt so as you all eventually find yourselves resting for the evening contemplating the plans  to take first thing in the morning well 
none	 go ahead and close tonights episode there well pick this  up next week  laura wait youre not going to be here next week  ashley i will ill just be a little late  marisha sprinting from the airport  ashley yeah  laura cool  taliesin well do the tour first while you guys are off freaking out with the  marisha bamfing  taliesin yeah  matt well stall if we need to well make it happen all righty guys well thank you so much  for watching tonight i hope you enjoyed it as much
