none	 the guild  itself they found themselves having pike join them for about a weeks time while the landscape  of her temple to sarenrae was being cleansed of a curse and the group decided to follow through on  their promise to aid keyleth on her aramente to find the pyrah people to the far southwest of  vasselheim  laura ugh  travis im burping garlic  matt ugh garlic stinking cloud over there you thought he wasnt a caster they made their way to  the mountains eventually to the actual pyrah tribe itself where they underwent 
none	 a trial through  the elemental plane of fire battled some of the druids the pyrah themselves in elemental fire  form combated against time through a cinder storm as they attempted to escape and managed to do so  with their lives and in doing so gained the blessing of the aramente for keyleth from the  pyrah tribe as well as a blessing from the main druid as well as a spark stone and  returned to vasselheim pike then said her goodbyes again returning to help the restoration  of the temple of sarenrae and youve all 
none	 been left to your devices now so as you all awaken  the next morning within the guildhall itself your journey and your path is your own to take  travis we wake the next morning beard check please  matt beard check laughs  travis zero or ten  laura thats zero  sam thats good  marisha it depends  travis thats a hundred  marisha are you serious  travis thats the second time thats happened  marisha all you had to have rolled was a nine or anything other than a zero thats all you had 
none	  to anything  matt if this had been the second edition encyclopedia magica you wouldve gotten the most  broken artifact ever you rolled two hundreds with a tiny methodical squeak your pores produce  but a few random molecules of hairlike material that then puff in the air around you  travis is it at least rough like you know he needs to shave its so rough  laura nah its smooth as a babys bottom  taliesin welloiled  laura fine leather thats what your face feels like  orion its still 24 hours since we had 
town	 the feast right it still counts as the same time  matt the travel back to the town took about two and a half three days so thats been long past  the feast so the benefits of the heroes feast have already been washed from your system  sam where am i  matt where are you thats a very good question as you returned tired from the venture went to  sleep you have spent the past week or so  sam on my own  matt on your own essentially finding one of the various establishments in 
none	 the city that can aid  you through your sore muscles through the help of feminine companionship or other types of  companionship whatever your preference may be but upon leaving realize that your party had left  and been gone for some time  sam where are they where am i  matt youve just now found word theyve returned to the slayers take guildhall and youve made  your way in that direction this bright morning  travis because its free to stay there  laura yeah we can stay there for free  sam hello  laura

none	 didnt lead with pike though you should have said pikes here hey pikes here  laura you probably should have done that  orion my bad  sam frustrated noise  orion sorry about that  sam i mean i was having a fun time but i wouldve dropped everything to be with pike  orion well a stormwind likes to finish a sentence and i apparently need to start a  sentence correctly for you to hold your attention long enough  sam dont bury the lede pike first always pike first  orion right sorry  sam i 
none	 wasnt even in a brothel  laura oh you werent  sam i walked toward the brothel but then i bumped into zahra remember zahra  taliesin oh zahra  sam she invited me over we talked all night one thing led to another nothing untoward but we  just had a nice slumber party it was lovely it was me and a couple of tieflings three i think  we were doing each others hair telling stories playing songs it was wonderful  travis can i roll to see if hes bullshitting  matt you can go ahead and 
none	 make a this would be an insight  travis yeah grog insight check modifier is zero thats a nine  laughter  matt you are enthralled by his tale your elbows are on the edge of the bedspread right now with  your hands clasped  travis are my feet behind me crisscrossing  matt you are this close to a breakdown from grease its pretty fantastic  travis singing tell me more tell me more  sam it was great we had a great pg night  marisha sounds like exactly what you needed  laura well then that 
dung	 sounds like a wonderful time its all right that you missed pike  sam yeah except i would have dropped everything to come to see the woman i love the woman of my  dreams the woman i will marry and bear children with i dont know if shell bear mine or ill  bear hers  orion yes how does it work with gnomes  sam gnomes its tricky  orion yes ive never seen a gnome birth before  sam you never know  taliesin would it help if there were trolls  sam oh dont get me

none	 you oh theres another meal okay ill stick around for another day and we  just kept going  travis did you do nails  sam we did not my hands just my toenails  laura all right  sam we braided hair we connected  laura thats wonderful  travis connected  sam well at least were all back we can get on the flying carpet and go somewhere fun  laura oh no  travis who wants to  laura scanlan youve missed everything  travis maybe we should let keyleth explain where the flying carpet went  
none	 taliesin yes keyleth where is the flying carpet  marisha why do i have to explain it  travis youre right tiberius where did the flying carpet go  orion its right here i open my bag of holding swoosh it just doesnt fly anymore  sam you have a bag of holding  orion i went to draconia for like two minutes and picked one up  sam thats really far  orion oh well i teleported i went there came back  laura so they killed the carpet it lives no more they also spent a lot of 
none	 money but hey  they didnt die and thats a good thing  sam that is a good thing  marisha and we fought a devil  laura a demon  sam whoa the devil  orion no a rakshasa  taliesin it seems that an enormous amount of alcohol has given you some perspective im very  proud of you well done  laura thank you  sam well thank you for catching me up fellows whats our mission now what are we doing now  laura that is a good question  orion i have a suggestion first 
none	 im going to bring up lockheed keyleth  if you think you could help  sam what i was gone for a day theres a dragon now  orion im going to take him out of his cage and put him on the table here  marisha aw hes got puppy breath oh yes you do yes you do  matt it is slightly worse than puppy breath  marisha you want me to cure him of poison  orion hes diseased you can maybe see if you could perhaps use your medicine strengths to see  what the problem 
none	 is  marisha i mean the heroes feast would have worked  orion yes i know thats why i asked earlier as the other guy  laura we did not have him with us then we didnt have him with us when we had the feast  orion no  laura you didnt think of him at the time  orion i said i fed him but i didnt say what i fed him  taliesin i have a strange thought  laura what  taliesin when was the last time we went home  laura well okay heres the 
town	 thing if were going to go home emon  taliesin greyskull  laura right if were going to go home i would really really like to stop by kraghammer  taliesin and pick up our money  laura yes 25000 gold  travis if were going to leave could i make a small request  taliesin you want to try again dont you  travis i have a bit of a chip on my shoulder  marisha oh  travis would you mind terribly if i maybe went out to the street and picked a fight  taliesin oh give 
town	 me strength  marisha wait go out on the street youre not going to chase down whatshisbutt  travis i want kern  marisha okay were going to find kern  sam are you sure about this  travis im sure  marisha hang on are we going to go find kern and do this with rules or we going to  do this without rules  sam without rules you would win  travis i cant do it i have to do it by the rules  laura so you want to go in the crucible again  travis 
tavern	 yeah is there a tavern downstairs or anywhere theyd have cups or wineskins  matt within the guildhall there is a mess hall area a kitchen would have cups but its not a  full tavern  laura tiberius do you have any wineskins or anything  orion excuse me  laura do you have a wineskin  orion oh im sorry i was waiting on my first request before  sam oh what was your first request  orion to see if keyleth could do anything but a wineskin yes  laura and travis oh thank you  marisha 
none	 can i do a check to see if i can tell what lockheed has what kind of disease  matt sure go ahead and make a medicine check  sam oh its sick get me away from it  marisha 21  matt 21 looking at lockheed you get the feeling that his disease essentially comes from a  continuous time period of poor meat being presented as a meal option its less of a magical  or any sort of unnatural disease its just something that is passing through his system  orion emaciated  matt not too emaciated 
none	 more that some bad meat has found its system which means without  treatment over time his health could diminish however if the food youve been feeding him has  been a decent level if this continues it might clear it could be aided through the use of simple  healing salves andor natural remedies  marisha can i make a few goodberries for him and feed him a few more goodberries  matt sure  taliesin why not great berries  marisha well i guess thats a matter of opinion percy  orion as far as the matters at 
none	 hand i of course grog encourage your violence and  taliesin i do quite like the idea of going back to emon  laura who did you just who did you just  taliesin you just npced me just npced me all over the place  orion oh sorry im sorry speaking draconic again percy  taliesin taliesin is my mothers name please no  orion sorry no thats not your mothers name  taliesin its not my mothers name she wasnt well carry on  laura what was your mothers name  orion im sorry percival i go over 
none	 to percival and i give him a hug  taliesin oh god  orion sorry im scaly  taliesin its all right we didnt touch in my family go ahead  orion i like the idea of going back to emon but before that i do believe we should go back to  kraghammer and collect our gold  taliesin and laura yes  orion did we say that already  taliesin and laura we did  orion wonderful i was concerned about lockheed  marisha so much has happened  orion im going to put him on my shoulder 
none	  travis did you say you encourage my violence  orion of course  travis i take off running out the room  laughter  marisha oh tiberius you have to be careful you have to be responsible  travis was there a window in the room  matt no not in this one  travis okay just checking  taliesin was there a looney tunes hole in the wall  laughter  matt so as grog bounds off into the distance do you guys give chase  orion and taliesin yes  matt you get out into the main 
town	 thoroughfare  marisha we really need to make that leash for him like we said we were going to  matt as you make your way to the main thoroughfare you look over and you catch the  image of the distant goliath heading northward towards the braving grounds just plowing through  the crowd you see a couple people that are knocked flat onto their ass like head shaking  what just happened as he just goes bounding into the distance  marisha follow the trail of distressed people  orion i give chase i give myself fly so 
town	 i can go over the crowd  matt as you glide over the crowd you can see a few bastions glance up and narrow their eyes and  begin whispering to themselves  orion its fine i realize what im doing and i stop  taliesin thats going on your tombstone i realize what im doing and i stop  matt as you enter the group you percy thanks to him notice that there are now no less than  five bastions keeping a 30foot distance walking and following behind tiberius  laura i go up and i tell tiberius 
town	 maybe its best just to keep a low profile for a while and i  turn around and wave at the bastions  taliesin its all right hes from emon  matt as soon as you wave and make that interaction they break off in two and three and  go in different directions and disappear into the crowd  laura cool that was fun  taliesin hunters mark one of them  laura yeah ill hunters mark one of them  orion do they feel that  laura oh wait can they feel that  matt go ahead and 
town	 make a sleightofhand check on this  laura oh gosh wait which one should i roll first okay hold on  natural 20 what  matt you are the antiwheaton as of late its kind of amazing all right yeah you hunters  mark one of the bastions who wanders off in the crowd and you have a very good idea of where he  andor the cluster thats with him is moving as you guys progress following this path that grog  is carving through the crowd heading for the main bazaar area at the center of the quad 
none	 roads  district heading northwestern up into the braving grounds of vasselheim you can also sense that  they are following though at a good 60foot distance keeping an eye on the redscaled  dragonborn that then flew out into the open air of the midday sun with his tinier dragon his very  meta dragonondragon action you continue pushing into the braving grounds area you can see now  giant black smokestacks that are billowing up from the various blacksmithies and there is a large  industrial iron complex that is used in the mining and reforming of all 
tavern	 the weapons and armor that go  to the bastions of the city here in the braving grounds you make your way up towards the bellows  respite inn to where the crucible itself is held in the center as you approach it is midday  theres no crowd gathered the crucible is currently empty and left on its own you glance  about for a second and theres nobody here running any sort of fight ring  sam damn it youll have to come back  travis shouting kern  matt as youre shouting into the air a few 
town	 people nearby  travis and the star trek reference is good his names kern its fun  matt nearby individuals drop their stuff and look over as this billowing deep goliath voice fills  the air around the center of this mildly businessasusual road vicinity suddenly a few  individuals come looking out from inside the bellows respite inn it has a tavern portion to  the front one of them is oncelucky ned who is the person that runs the tavern hes a human  barkeep that wanders out and you philip yelling kern and you see this look 
town	 on his face  travis bring me the body of kern  laura alive alive  orion he wants to fight him  matt he cocks his head a little bit at you just a moment stay right there  and he runs back inside  sam theres going to be a street fight  marisha i hear scanlan say that and i run out and i say shouting fight  matt at this point other members of the tavern are starting to come out tankards in hand like  whats going on they see you oh theres going to 
town	 be a fight at the crucible you hear the  shouts going off the nearby houses its echoing like town crier to town crier youre hearing  voices echo throughout the entirety of the braving grounds people preparing for this midday  unexpected throwdown at this point you see a few of the bastions wearing the armor that is geared  towards kord the god of strength that runs this portion of vasselheim  laura the ones that im keeping an eye on  matt no the ones that youre keeping an eye on were from the quad roads and 
dung	 theyre still  staying back one of them the one that youve marked is around the corner just keeping an eye  on everybody but hes mainly keeping to himself he does stand out like a sore thumb because his  armor is darker and based around erathis whereas here the bastions that are under kords vision  have more of a red dark almost rusty look to their armor  anyway as the shouts continue some of the kord bastions gather one of which you recognize as the  one who was acting as the bookie the first time 
none	 you came to the crucible and he looks wiping  sleep from his eyes he looks like he just got into his armor and rushed out here for about ten  minutes since you just came out here and shouted your challenge to the sky  he rushes out for a second  you hey am i to hear properly that you are  challenging our standing champion once again  travis aye you heard right  matt midday now under the noonday sun  travis aye where everyone can see and he cant hide  matt he glances over 
town	 to another bastion thats to his left get kern now he rushes off and he  looks back to you well then a fight were going to have at this point now theres  probably about 20 25 people that are beginning to gather around the outskirts of the crucible around  you oh its philip philips showing down with kern theres all these different whispers  now going throughout the crowd as the rest of you gather the bastion that youve been following  backs off and stays further back and is slowly keeping a distance further away as 
town	 the crowd  begins to gather wanting to stay inconspicuous amongst all this chaos and  rabble you guys have collected  marisha i join in with everybody else yeah did you see that kerns fighting philip  taliesin why are you telling me this of course i know  marisha kerns fighting  orion i also know  marisha shit  laura can i try subtly to pass off my ring of ac to grog  matt grog do you have any enchantment of protection currently  travis nope  matt you do not  travis i dont  
none	 matt on the ring does it say attunement required  laura no it doesnt i dont think hold on let me look  matt i can look it up for you if need be  laura ring of protection  travis yeah my belt of dwarvenkind is the only thing but thats all  laura it just says plus two bonus to ac and saving throw oh requires attunement  matt yeah you have to take time to go ahead and attune to the magical item  laura damn it im sorry grog  travis its all right  laura 
town	 you shouldnt have taken off running  matt laughs about 20 minutes pass by as the crowd is now gathered about 50 to 60 people  apparently word of your last battle has gotten around and now theres this fevered pitch of  interest people have dropped what theyre doing and the smokestacks you can see have slowly turned  to a dribble as everyone whos working the nearby forges andor smelting irons have rushed out here  to see this battle and dropped what theyre doing this has turned into fullon  morpheus is fighting neo  travis i 
town	 turn to the bookie and i take out my entire coin purse and i throw it at him  orion i use my mage hand  laura no dont use magic  orion oh no i dont i dont do that  taliesin we whack him on the head before he starts to do the hand stop it  travis i throw him the coin purse and i say i expect to see that doubled when i get out and i  jump into the pit before kern even arrives  matt you leap and the whole crowd goes cheering 
none	 and this series of shouting screams surround the  air around you he grabs the coin purse how much is in that coin purse  travis according to this its eleven that cant be right can it  sam 11000  laura personal funds  matt your personal funds not whats in the bag of holding  travis 1363  matt 1363 gold pieces  laura thats normal he probably has more than that  marisha you should start charging admission at the door  sam i run up theres a bookie here  matt there is a bookie  
none	 sam i run up to him and very subtly say id like a hundred against grog please  laughter  matt okay he looks down at you and says not bad going with the odds  its three to one against him  sam all right yes just dont mention if i win maybe ill come and collect later  orion i have 600 gold pieces  matt you dont hear this  sam ill collect later dont say anything  matt all right  taliesin good chap id like to place a bet 500 gold pieces on philip  
town	 matt on to philip all right laughs 500  orion im going to break my bank and follow suit to my human friend 612 is i think  all i have left  matt curious number but certainly at this time the crowd gets a little more hushed people  are like oh and you see you dont see this because youre down in the crucible you see the  crowd which has probably gathered close to 70 plus people part and you see walking over soot  smeared across the front of his face stepping up is kern the 
none	 hammer with a bristled halforc  mustache a little bit tousled from a day of hard work sweat glistening off the top of his brow and  the top of his head  travis hes missing a lip  matt as he approaches you can see there has been some healing through the quick work of the  clerics who worked after the last battle however there is definitely a section of his upper lip  that is permanently missing looking almost like a halfcleft palate you can see beneath it his  sneering yellowed teeth grinding as he approaches 
none	 the crucible  taliesin i believe in you philip  laura im going to bet  matt youre going to bet  laura im going to bet im going to put 600 on philip  marisha so wait this betting thing is enjoyable  orion no its not its a gamble  marisha it feels bad  taliesin its terrible  marisha so why do we do it  orion so we can make more and plus its giving faith in our friend  laura its inspiration  marisha ill bet five gold on philip  travis laughs thats an 
town	 excellent bet that is an excellent bet keyleth  marisha thank you is that how it works  matt vax stands behind you and is like yes ill stand behind your bet and keeps his gold to  himself at this point the crowd separates this tensions mounting and everyones eyes are on  kern as he steps up to the edge of the crucible you now notice the dark figure the noonday sun is  now high in the sky and you can see by the little bit of the shadowed outline of kern  musclebound looming over the

none	 a humans leg would have hyperextended but  the sheer size of muscle and this is comparable to your own you feel it definitely hurt and hes  like pained cry yelp out in pain but its not enough to fully pop the leg back  travis whats the matter ballerina i thought you should be stretched out and ready for this  and i reach back and i drive my fist into his nutsack  laughter  matt roll a second attack  travis 25  matt that definitely hits go ahead and roll damage on that  orion 
none	 oh my god a grog punch to the balls  travis eight my first eight  matt nice second eight actually youve already rolled  travis oh thats right okay  orion im going to argue that that should be doubled because theres two balls  laughter  matt kern is one of those individuals whos had his nuts kicked enough times in his life to know  the pain well and be prepared for it so as you come down whack slam it right into him you  hear this high pained wail almost wolflike screeching howl as kerns 
none	 head lifts up in severe  pain his hands come down and grasp your wrist and is now holding it trying to pull it away from his  midsection hes in a very bad situation right now  travis with that last one can i take my right leg and in an effort to shoot for that same knee  ive been kicking at aim for the knee or sweep his feet  matt sure go for it  travis fuck thatll miss its a 13  matt 13 as you pull back to sweep kern uses this advantage to 
none	 bring up the other leg that you  havent hit plant it right on your shoulder and neck area and then push off your body as you  sweep underneath he leaps backward flipping in the air thud lands on both of his feet  clutching the inside of his groin area like snarling grunt shaking off the pain through the  anger so he leaps back to here  marisha as thats happening we all start a chant  all chanting grog grog grog  sam as theyre chanting im starting to sing amid the chant singing its the 
none	 eye of the  goliath its the thrill of the fight rising up to the challenge of that asshole speaking and  im trying to send inspiration to him  matt with that you hear through the fury through the anger that the chant your real name  not philip now your real name reclaimed in the center of this proving point in the center of the  oldest known city to civilization under the visual guidance of the god of strength and valor  and through all that you hear the gentle hymn of scanlans voice cut through all 
none	 that and come to  you with a beat a rhythmic beat that drives you forward go ahead and take a d10 inspiration  cheering  matt now kern having landed on his feet rushes forward towards you and first using his bonus  action is going to go ahead and reach down for a very deep uppercut it looks like hes coming in  for a left and sweeps down to try and take you from underneath breaking through your defense that is going  to be a 20  travis that hits  matt you take ten points 
none	 of damage right to the chin from underneath for the bonus action kern  then comes back and youre used to an unleashed flurry kern however comes back into a fully  defensive position righting his hands and leg in a backwards stance and is just looking at you  ready for you to come hes using his action to go into a dodge its now your turn  sam oh wait so he gets some sort of advantage  matt all attacks against him have disadvantage this next turn  orion wait against him no he meant advantage because 
none	 balls  matt nope  orion damn it  marisha the balls doesnt give advantage  orion no he has tough nuts never mind  matt he has the feat toughness which i think really resists any sort of  ball damage at this point  travis in an effort to keep my distance i run towards him i jump up in the air and throw one  thrustkick towards the side right towards his chest just to see what his defense will do  matt go for it with disadvantage so roll twice  laura oh god mother bitch 
none	  travis well that was a natural 20 but 19  matt 19 total 19  travis total 19  matt that just barely hits  travis can i add the inspiration to the no just to the roll right that is an eight  matt eight so  travis halved so half of three is one and a half and were rounding up  matt rounding up yeah three and four is a two considered  travis right so eight  matt all righty all right so you rush up whack slamming he puts the defense out and  
none	 tries to push to the side however his defense is imperfect you can see hes still new to this  fighting style and you still manage to push through with sheer force and slam into the side of  his torso from the impact  travis i leap forward again and try to throw my thumbs into his eyes  matt okay youre going for the blind again go ahead and roll an attack on this with  disadvantage  travis 21 aw 15  matt 15  orion inspiration  sam if you want to use it  travis 
none	 thats a 22  matt 22 hits  cheering  matt so you rush forward to grab you have hold of his head now theres no damage this round but  youre enabling yourself now for the rest of the round to attempt to push into his eyes theres no  damage on this one you grab the side of his head and you see his eyes open with this look of fear  at the unexpected ferocity from you go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha come on grog  travis 24  matt 24 he rolled 
none	 a 19 so go ahead and do damage on this roll damage  travis with the four six  matt six all righty so as you have a hold of his head you grin as your thumbs push into his  eyes he yells out in pain and before you can damage the eyes permanently he slaps off of your  hands so hard and with such an intense push that you cant help but feel your actual forearms be  blown back however hes clutching the side of his face and for the next round he is blinded  
none	 travis can i move  matt you can move as well  travis i just back straight up  matt back this way he currently doesnt threaten you because hes blinded so you can rush past him  and not get an attack of opportunity  travis oh really  matt yeah  travis ill move along the wall to his left side  matt over here  travis yes  matt to there  travis yes  matt okay  laura but back up  travis and back up just a little bit yeah  matt okay so as 
none	 you dodge off to the side kerns grabbing his face and just takes a moment  hears your footsteps along the side as there is no stealth to this there are just footprints  however kern does attempt to sidestep over hes going to attempt to make three strikes at you  with a disadvantage on all of them because hes currently blinded  travis all right you seem to be rolling pretty high you could use the dice that i threw  matt and rolls against him have advantage as well all right so attacks against you that is 
none	  going to be a 14  travis misses  matt natural 20 or an eight so thatll be 16  travis okay that misses  matt 19 and 19 another one does hit so wide punches forward theyre a foot away from you you  chuckle getting out of the way and as you chuckle he hears that snap and for a moment  his mind clarifies even though his eyes are closed with a trickle of blood off the side of one  of the eye he immediately goes into a fasterthanyouexpected midsection punch that  whack smacks 
none	 you right in the middle of your laughing stomach because youre laughing there  is that tension but it wasnt flexed prepared for an actual impact from a fist and you take  seven points of damage from the hit to your abdomen  travis all right  matt it is your turn he is still blinded so you have advantage on all these attacks as you reel  from the hit to your midsection  travis i want to move no ill stay right where i am can i reach forward grab his head and his  shoulder and 
none	 go in for a bite attack at his neck  matt you certainly can  travis growls yes aiming for the jugular 23  matt 23 definitely hits go ahead and roll damage on that  travis all right eight  sam youre sure youre adding that right  travis yeah  sam its just plus four  travis plus six this is halved  sam are you sure i thought you were both raging theres no halves  travis no we halve the die  sam is that true  matt both of them are at half damage because 
none	 of their raging so were considering them both to  not count that  sam so theyre not counting the halves  laura so he shouldnt be halving his die  matt well no the die halving is the natural damage of a punch 1d2 so its half of a d4  laura got it sorry  matt except for kern who is currently doing a full d4 on his punches for some reason laughs  all right so as you rush in he puts out a hand to try and punch instinctively as you rush towards  him his 
tavern	 eyes still coated in his own blood you push to the side reach in and grab the back of  his shoulder and crunching sound grogbite into the side its like biting into a tree trunk his  skin is so thick  travis i eat bar stools for dinner  matt you do actually and the taste is similar your teeth grind in and you find yourself tearing  into probably what would be the toughest steak youve ever tried you get about a quarter to a  half an inch in with your teeth definitely taking a chunk 
none	 and tearing sound tearing out what you  can but based on the general hardiness of his halforc structure you dont get to a jugular or  any major vein but you do leave a gash that leaves a significant mark on his body thats the  first attack  travis i pull back from the bite and i whisper into his ear i was wondering what was going to  break first your spirit or your body and i would like to try to pick him up over my head and  bring him down on my knee banestyle 
none	  laura batman  matt go ahead and make an athletics check with advantage  travis okay thats 25  matt 25  travis do i need to roll on advantage to see if i get a 20  matt sure go for it  travis oh its a 19 it was so close 26  matt 26  travis son of a bitch  matt you reach forward and scoop him up lifting him over your head hes trying to resist it but  in his unabletosee state theres no way he can possibly resist this you lift him 
none	 up over the  top whack down onto the knee go ahead and roll damage i will consider both your two final  attacks but this attack damage is doubled modifier included  travis seven so 14  cheering  matt all right as part of this he is  sam oh no hes going to pull some shit  travis matt reaching for things is never good  matt im going to go ahead and make a constitution check on his end the dc is going to  be the damage dealt so hes going to try and essentially 
none	 resist the effect of this he is at  disadvantage because hes blinded that is a three an 18 and a three however he still has a  high constitution and so thats still plus 9 to that  taliesin travis and laura 12  matt not enough to beat the 14 so for the purposes of this round kern is currently on the  ground stunned he loses an entire round of combat  excited noises  matt no longer blinded but kern is currently choking noises reaching towards his back where  theres this shooting pain throughout his 
none	 entire nervous system you have another round to go  travis i reach up with my fingernails and i carve these scrapes down my face and i leap up  with both feet and i jump down on his head  yelling  laura its so brutal  matt all right go ahead and roll attacks have advantage on him because hes stunned  travis thats better 23  matt 23 hits  travis you know what just three of them battle cry  matt just ragestomping on him okay three attacks  travis 20  matt 20 hits  
none	 marisha youre right this is so much more exciting when you bet  travis 15  matt the first you leap up into the air both feet down wham right into the shoulder and side  of the rib cage you hear a wet crunching noise snap as at least two ribs give way under the sheer  weight and force of your left foot as you leap up again bring down both feet a second time one  finds purchase on the ground next to him while the second one hits him right in the lower  abdomen pelvis 
none	 region whack with this second one you hear deep groaning the scream as the  air is nearly knocked out of kern the third one you reach up this time just seeing seething rage  you can feel the actual foam at the corners of your mouth dripping down the sides of your chin  as you bring your leg up again to stomp a third time this time kern rolls out of the way he  manages to just avoid the third slam whats the total damage on that  travis did i roll its good eight and eight 
none	  matt damn  taliesin you turned him into a stain  matt kern no longer stunned now gets up grunts holding the back of his side  laura you suck kern  orion you also smell  matt chuckles glances up for a moment at you and sees you raising your fists and gives a grin  looks back towards you and lunges towards you now hes going to attempt a grapple at you go ahead and  make an athletics check  travis thats a one  laura do you get an advantage at all  matt nope 
none	 no longer blinded no longer stunned you are considered currently grappled all right  so for the action there as a bonus action hes going to rear back open his mouth and attempt to  bite towards your face  marisha hes mike tysoning you  matt correct that is a 21  travis that hits  matt you take ten points of damage and you feel teeth grasp on to the top of your lip and with a  sickening sharp burning sensation wet ripping noise your upper lip is now torn from the front  of your face 
none	 as you see kern reel back a streak of blood spilling off in an arc as his head pulls  back a terrible grin creeping across his smile as you now see this dull graycolored grog  fleshtoned piece of skin dangling bloodily from his mouth  disgusted noises  marisha we can fix it  matt your turn currently grappled so you cant move  travis i would like to attempt to break that grapple  matt okay make an athletics check  travis that is 21  matt he rolled a 14 so you break from the grapple 
none	 still have your bonus action  travis both of my bonus actions or all three  matt actually breaking from grapple let me doublecheck it uses an action so yeah its  your action you still have a bonus action  travis i blow through my newly lipless mouth laughs and i run up and  i throw my face into his  matt okay go ahead and roll for your headbutt  travis thats a 17  matt 17 misses as you dodge forward kern actually spits it toward you and it squelch hits  you in the face 
none	 and for a second it completely throws you off your head still goes forward  however as you look down kern has already swished beneath you the sheer speed is  unexpected hes now beneath looking up and grabs the chunk of the lip that he had taken and comes  up for a full round of attacks against you  travis wait that was just my one attack  matt oh thats right you still have no you used your action to break the grapple so youre  still grappled so you cant move so this is his turn 
none	  travis i broke the grapple  matt you did break the grapple so yeah you could still move if you wanted to  travis no ill stay there  matt okay that is a 23  travis hits  matt 23 and a 12  travis sighs misses  matt so grabs the lip in one hand reaches up and then slam uppercuts you from underneath for  the first hit that is seven points of damage  travis okay  matt the next one however is eight points of damage swings up and actually haymakers you to  
none	 the side with the hand still holding the chunk of your lip in it slamming impact across the side  of your face and is going to attempt to do a backwards leaping flipkick however because kern  is not as practiced at this and is overextending you see it telegraphed far in advance and you  duck out of the way and it whoosh whiffs past kern loses his balance for a minute and in an  embarrassing moment almost falls over from his own strike manages to catch himself and is like  nobody saw that right that

none	 foot finds the side of the knee and the knee  this time buckles under the weight cracking off to the side kern falls onto one knee puts both  hands out on the ground and coughing coughs up this sputtering puddle of blood that then spills  out on the ground kern looks like that blow is about to knock kern over to the side but kern  sits there and tenses his muscles his head whips up at you and that orcish glare that sheer focus  of fury that you saw once before is holding him on 
town	 the edge kern looks up at you  no this is my town roars  and leaps up at you with a flurry of an extremely desperate halforc first strike  comes at you that is a 22 to hit  travis hits  matt that is a 27 to hit  travis hits  matt and natural 20  groaning  matt first strike is ten points of damage  travis ten points okay  matt next one is eight points of damage  travis okay  matt last one which is eight six 14 points of damage

none	 however as his bonus action all of a sudden takes two steps forward and almost  bruce lee oneinch whipping noise punches to your torso that is nine plus eight 17  travis misses  matt misses goes to punch however the short distance while the speed is extreme misjudged  the distance and it stops an inch before your chest you look down and its barely stopping  before it finds your chest looks up at you come at me  marisha he just comeatmebrod you  sam is he in defense now  matt hes in dodge mode

town	 gets to come up and look at the crowd one last time before sending him straight back onto  his shoulder blades and neck and smashing him into the earth  matt smash with a resounding slam kerns body impacts into the stone floor of the crucible a  cloud of dirt and dust whoosh around rocks break off and tumble down the side of the walls of  the crucible as the crowd has to stop themselves from falling in from the sheer impact of the  tremor that youve left slamming kern you can see everyone fall silent 
town	 the crowds cheers all come  to a sudden halt the dust settles you can see nothing at the base of the crucible as the cloud  slowly comes to rest you see there broken and laid out on the ground is an unconscious  bloodied and ruined kern as grog steps forward head hunched beneath his billowing shoulders  fists clenched in anger victorious in the center of the crucible  travis i put my foot on his chest and do my best king kong yells  matt at which point the crowd raises into shouting cheers claps  
town	 laura did i show my boobs  sam no  taliesin none of us remember that at all  matt the bookie screams out we have now a new champion of the crucible not philip but grog  the victorious cheers and shouts and you hear loud boos even curses shouted you see people  shouting off throwing empty coin purses off to the side different language its a whole  cacophony of cheers and curses and then all of them fall suddenly quiet the whole crowd turns  over to the edge of the crucible you see standing over 
dung	 let me bring this down here for a moment of  tension standing over to the edge a hood is thrown back on a figure thats been watching the  entire fight you notice this figure as the hood is thrown back an older human man in his mid to  latesixties with tough reddish tanned skin short but stocky receding gray hairline with a  long coarse gray beard that tumbles to his belt line he wears what looks like ceremonial robes of  red and gold simple wooden sandals and a dark brown necklace of large twoinch round 
town	 beads that  adorn the shoulders and neck area his body is stout and ripped as muscle trained over a  lifetime of martial prowess and careful honing his arms are crossed as he looks down at the  crucible down at you grog gives a nod and a smile turns around and walks away from the crowd  quietly as everyone silently takes in this momentary experience a few seconds pass and then  the crowd continues cheering once again  cheering  matt the clerics now come climbing down to the center of the crucible to retrieve the 
none	 unconscious  and bleedingout body of kern administering heals immediately to make sure he doesnt actually slip  away from everyone  travis i run over and grab my lip and pick it up and go just between you and me is there anything  we can do with this  laughter  matt one of the clerics looks up for a second hold it there for a moment and reaches out and  administers a 5thlevel cure wounds hes making a medicine check to see how well thats a 16 you  go ahead and heal thats shitty rolls 
none	 ten i shouldve just rolled that one there you heal 22  hit points but you feel your lip fuse and while it might leave a very small scar it is in one  piece you might want to be careful about spitting or anything too heavy with it for the next few  days for fear of jettisoning it from the front of your face accidentally  travis right or growing a beard on it oh thats already on my chin  taliesin if you grow enough beard you can knit it together to hold it in place  
town	 travis im actually sweating  laura yeah i am too  matt you make your way up the rope ladder to the top of the crucible as the crowd some folks come  up and cheer and grab your hand and shake it thank you i believed youd do this kerns been  sent in there too long its about time he got taken down laughs and he gets pushed out of  the way by another person a young guy 16 scrawny but excited youre my new hero oh my god oh  grog where did you learn to

town	 heard your voices cutting through the crowd where are tiberius and keyleth  orion grog we got arrested while you were fighting just so you know  matt you guys by the way right now are currently brought to a small holding facility not  far from the crucible where youve been set down on a bench both manacled and left while the one  bastion that originally found you is currently keeping watch  travis outside  matt out of vision of you guys you dont see theyre just missing  sam grog before we go deal with our 
none	 friends if i may that man fought a brave fight i feel you  should go make amends with him it was a respectable battle you wont feel good about  yourself unless you do  matt at which point the bookie hands a sack of gold right into your hand  well fought new champion and hands it to you  travis fuck that shit laughs i was about to but chaotic neutral sorry  laughter  orion never mind  travis i was ready  taliesin and that kids is chaotic neutral  matt at three to one

none	 sobered me up a little bit i do walk over to kern the hammer  and extend a hand and say well fought brother  matt his arms are currently draped over two of the clerics that have pulled him out of the  crucible face broken blood streaked down one side of his face is stepping with one foot  dragging the toes of the other grunts is brought to turn around to face you by the two  clerics and looks at you as you extend your hand looks over at you one eye swollen shut the other 
none	  glaring at you bloodshot and angry you see the teeth are gritted and grinding beneath his  stillbusted missing upper lip snarls laughs well fought goliath and he groans brings one  hand around one of the clerics and takes you in a beastmaster  travis yes strength and honor  matt however there is no strength left its barely there he takes his hand back and it hangs  loosely to one side and he looks at you and says im proud to have finally found my match when i  recover im going to find you and

none	 few seconds pass and the door slides open a little bit and from the inside you  can see a partially scarred on one cheek late thirties early forties gentleman who looks  squarejawed and definitely trained in some semblance of looking gruff and angry and says  can i help you  laura hi yes im looking for sighs im looking for a couple of people theyre actually  mental patients and theyve gotten loose  orion vex here we are  laura oh thats them im afraid  matt these two cheaters over here these are the ones

town	 you wish to do  laura stuttering money kraghammer  taliesin emon by way of kraghammer  marisha is there anything else we want to do while were here  orion no  marisha are we over this town over this city  taliesin i just need to pick up a little bit of ore on the way out so i can work on making some  more ammunition on the way to kraghammer  orion i like that idea we could take the airship and you could craft some things when we do go i  think i might 
none	 have an idea for our carpet situation  sam oh  marisha really  sam your wheel of mending perhaps  orion no that didnt work  liam we tried that it didnt work  orion it kept it intact but when we return to house thunderbrand i believe we have a few items  that they want the deal was when we procure certain items we will be allowed to have certain  information and certain we didnt explain what we were going to get but we should return get  our gold and definitely visit house thunderbrand  
none	 laura right cause they have magic things  orion they are strongly arcane perhaps they can enchant for what we have procured for them in  that venture and maybe that could be a good way of getting around getting our carpet reenchanted  without costing any coin  taliesin well prod that  liam can they make me unsee my sisters boobies  laura you didnt see them you were behind me so shut up what are you doing all the  way over there anyway  sam i saw them i saw them  orion scanlan when you 
none	 describe them to me  sam i will draw them in great detail  orion thank you  marisha i wasnt there either  laura how about no  taliesin in great details of the internet just saying i went there it was already there  laura i was caught up in a moment of passion im sorry  taliesin too late  sam she would do anything for you grog  laura anything for you and for the 600 gold that that i put on your fight  sam oh it was for the money  liam listen i

tavern	 drunk  orion are we ready to go  travis were getting ore right  marisha were celebrating grog right  travis doesnt percy want ore  taliesin its not hard to get a little bit of ore im just going to pick up some  orion after that are we ready to go  sam well maybe theres two more things that i have unanswered questions for first of all you  said we were going to stop on the way to get a new carpet or to get our carpet repaired  orion we need to go to 
none	 kraghammer to collect our 30000 gold waiting for us  laura 25000  orion 25000 sorry while were there house thunderbrand weve procured a few items or at  least one while we were down in the underdark we should return there and talk to them and perhaps  in exchange for gold perhaps have them enchant the carpet to fly again  sam that is a smart idea thats great before we leave though does anyone have a nagging tugging  feeling about that cloaked human who praised your performance should we investigate that at all  travis he

none	 okay  taliesin i have an even better brilliant yet slightly inebriated thought  sam oh i think i saw tiberius fall over  marisha oh is tiberius puking oh  laura what is it percy  taliesin my thought is i can probably find some of the ore i need to procure at the same time that  we find this groon fellow and at the very least you can strike up a quick conversation with him  laura would you like me to go with you grog as your manager  travis i would actually like both the 
tavern	 twins to go with  sam grog would you like any young boys to accompany you  laughter  taliesin you can give them a medal  travis no  orion i went back into the bar because i went to take a piss outside  laura lets go  marisha wait wherere we going  orion what is going on  laura you guys are recovering from your drink  orion hold on a second  marisha no  orion ive had plenty of water  taliesin youre already been arrested today  orion im fine slurred scanlan has 
none	 been ordering me water for the whole time  has been cleared  marisha thats right i have already been arrested today but i did get better  matt all right so you guys are going with percy to procure materials for forging new ammunition  taliesin yes  matt all right go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin what happened to my dice okay 14  matt 14 okay it takes you roughly 30 minutes or so thankfully this region itself contains  honestly most of the smithingbased materials andor workshops they required the difficult part  
none	 is finding black powder it is not refined in this region its usually considered almost a byproduct  of some of the mining and smelting and its very rare to find eventually you find one smithy that  gathers it youre not entirely certain why and after you give people a couple of examples of the  smell of it and what to look for people send you in this one direction and youre sent to this one  small hovel that is attached to the very base of the mountain that overlooks the entirety of the  city on 
none	 the far northwestern edge of the braving grounds you come to the door and its a very  simple slovenlykept house the wood itself is a little warped from the weather it hasnt kept  well and theres a musty smell of mildew from the outside of the building but you see a slight glow  between the cracks apparently there is some sort of interior light  taliesin hello  matt yes  taliesin charming my name is percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  sam huzzah  taliesin thank you i was sent here in terms 
none	 to hopefully negotiate the purchase of some black  powder i heard  matt the door slams open at this point midsentence and you see from around the corner a  very lithe crookedlooking man quite elderly but very spry for his size you see his arms and  legs are very lanky and almost spiderlike in the way they move and shift as he peeks out and you  can see he has spectacles of two different sizes and thicknesses around each eye his hair is  frazzled and gray and white and he goes yes you said you 
none	 need black powder yes yes come in  come in and he runs back into the hovel  taliesin i gingerly enter  matt as you step inside the scent hits you immediately and you realize this place is  probably filled with black powder and the last thing anyone wants is to set off any sort of  flame this would be a very bad idea and as you look around your eyes adjust to the lowlit  interior you realize its lowlit because there are two very very faintly set magical torch  sconces on each side that 
none	 are very very low light  laura very similar to the ones surrounding you  matt kind of like these but even smaller and you can see in the room there is a small forge  thats in disuse to the far end  taliesin i would hope so  matt there are a large large large number of crates and barrels that all seem to be containing  various parts of discarded gravel basically whatever is shoved off of any mining expedition  goes to him and he just shuffles through it and separates in different pieces and theres 
none	 barrels  full of sulfur barrels full of what looks like broken onyx or broken quartz and theyve all been  separated and you can see now this is his ocd collection and there is indeed at the far end  what looks to be a barrel that contains a large amount of black powder that is just everywhere  its like this very fine coat of powder that is encompassing this entire room and as he turns  around you can see now his hands themselves are black and coated in it and he goes so you came  
none	 looking for black powder did you no one asks about the black powder but i knew it had a  purpose yes you wish to buy it how much do you want  giggling  matt pants heavily speak up speak up i havent all day  taliesin how much for a barrel or a hogsheads worth  matt for the barrel the barrel thatll run you mutters 4623 gold pieces for the barrel  however for the hogshead you can see now the spittle dribbling down his chin  taliesin i can its as if i can see the 
none	 spittle myself  matt yes indeed but for the hogshead which ooh and he turns around and shuffles through a  bunch of pieces of burlap and sacks and pulls out what looks to be an actual dried and hollowedout  hogs head to fill this to fill this hogs head with it thisll only cost you 426 gold pieces  yes  taliesin how about 400 even and you can direct me to some ore as well  matt ore i do not work in ore  taliesin i thought you might have a friend  matt make a 
none	 persuasion roll  travis nice percy  liam look at that he slipped right into mercer there  sam no thats the other character  taliesin i love percy 25  matt 25  taliesin im sure you have a friend you must you seem so amiable  matt 400 400 and i send you to samson yes you take  taliesin my good sir you have a deal  matt glorious he turns around and jams the hog head into the barrel of black powder picks it up  poof the soot settles against you and the rest of 
none	 you guys as you now find yourself partially  covered in this slowly dissipating cloud of black powder coughs you cough instinctively and  push it away yes 400 gold you pay  taliesin i gingerly put the purse down in front of me  matt he takes it with a whisk its already put away into a side pouch and you hear the clanging  of haphazard coins in his far pocket here hog head take it grunts to samson this way and  he grabs your arm and drags you out of his hovel he points across the 
none	 way with his shaking crooked  finger samson there in the brick building tell him victor sent you hell give you ore  taliesin thank you for all of your help youve been so kind  matt my pleasure you want more powder come back yes yes  taliesin i might do that  matt good goodbye and pushes you out takes both of you by the arms and pushes you out slams  the door behind and you are left standing there halfcovered in blackened soot and black powder  in the center of the thoroughfare midday stunned by 
none	 the whole encounter  travis i mean come on come the fuck on  sam amazing matts crazy prospector character  taliesin im going to walk over to samsons place and become very excited at the  prospect of a new accent  liam 62 64 65  taliesin 43 from the russian judge  matt yeah you walk to the distant brick building the bricks themselves are made of a  hardened grayish clay material thats been made in the basic construction of this the roof itself  is a solid slab of stone there is no pretty or 
town	 elegant aspect of its construction its merely  built here for purpose the door is partially ajar and as you peek in you can see there is a  very active forge there is a heat emanating from the interior and you can see there is a man who  is currently hammering something away at what looks like an anvil set outside in front of it  metal clanging  yes  taliesin mr samson  matt yes  taliesin the strange fellow down the road sent me to you he said you might have some ore  matt 
none	 heavy sigh the head sinks into the shoulders with a sigh all right if you dealt  with that crazy old coot at the very least i can offer you a brief conversation hold on just a  second grunts and you see he takes this visor off the front of his face and sets it down and  removes these big leather gloves and this leather apron of sorts and puts it to the side and he  wipes his brow as he steps over and you can see him now hes a man in his late twenties  
none	 musclebound a little thick around the waist barrelchested a little bit of scruff on his  chin but nothing beyond not having time for upkeep and focused on his work he steps up so  what did the old coot tell you anyway  taliesin he said you might have some raw ore for sale that i might purchase youll excuse me if i  dont come in im covered in explosive powder  matt no please stay there for the love of kord stay on that doorstep do not step into my  abode please  taliesin of course 
none	  matt please  taliesin no yes  matt please all right what ore are you interested in  taliesin just some iron ore actually i have a little invention which sends projectiles  at great speed  matt that sounds fascinating i have ore for sale raw ore would you like ingots i prepare  ingots theyre a little more expensive but theyre proper and ready for any sort of use as  blacksmithing materials  taliesin ingots would be preferable yes  matt all right how many are you looking for five ten 20  taliesin what could 
none	 you give me for approximately a thousand golds worth  matt he gives you an arched eyebrow in surprise i mean i only have about 200 pounds of iron  ingots at the ready  taliesin i certainly cant carry that much with me right now  lets say about a hundred pounds worth  matt a hundred pounds of iron ingots i could sell it to you lets set the price at about 400  gold pieces  laura ugh haggle him down im not there  liam but in the back of his head he hears your voice 
none	 we all do at this point  taliesin lets say 350 gold and i promise to always shower twice before entering your home for  my next purchase  matt make a persuasion roll  taliesin all right  sam pointless haggle i love it best part of the show  marisha i wish i were percy  taliesin 24  matt 24 he goes you drive a hard bargain however underneath all that soot i can see you  dress well at the very least a bit tattered around the edges id like future business so  350 and 
none	 take the ingots and please do shower next time  taliesin of course you are a gentleman and apparently a worthy smith as well i do bid you  good day then  matt ive already completed the transaction flattery is not required he reaches over and  settles into a large triplebagged sack of ingots he gets partway through and goes nah  this is cartworthy he sets it up on a small cart and brings it over to you and its a small  wheeled wooden cart it looks really rickety and probably about to collapse but he 
none	 does not charge  you for it it can be handcarried if need be  taliesin good man i will see you when my need arises again  matt i look forward to it remember bathed  taliesin very bathed in fact quite bathed  matt seriously bathed please all right were good thank you and he closes the door all  right you guys  travis were going to see earthbreaker  sam and laura earthbreaker groon  matt all right make your way to the outskirts of the trial forge  orion we know who he is do 
none	 we need to pursue this guy  laura just to talk to him because he likes grog  marisha i mean we can stay and keep getting daydrunk  sam why dont you just go get arrested again  marisha hey that hurts scanlan  taliesin im going to come back and join you  orion im going to do a daily roll for my pet because im going to try to teach a trick and i  rolled a 15  matt okay trying to teach it a trick  orion yeah at the end of the does it 
none	 just build up points today and then try  matt what kind of trick are you teaching  orion to scout  matt to scout for you id say with a 15 yeah you take some time and with a small draconian  command a phrase of your choice you teach it that on that one phrase it will go ahead and  wander ahead for a bit and then come back and relinquish in very broken very basic draconic  language into your connection with it very very basic information on what it saw  orion cool  sam 
none	 im going to throw a lightning bolt spell into my ioun stone  matt okay so you store that awesome  orion little treat  matt it takes it and gobbles it down happily awesome you guys make your way to the trial  forge the large temple to kord itself its once again brilliant to behold there are steps leading  up to the front area these giant reddish almost rustedover looking iron doors that block the  front entrance at the very top of it you see looming over this entire district is a gargantuan  statue of 
none	 kord himself this giant musclebound humanoid titan of a figure that stands there  giant beard musclebound torso bracers against the arms just one knee up this very heroic pose  and just looking over the rest of vasselheim under his gaze you see at the front of these iron  doors there are two more bastions adorned in the same way as the ones that oversaw the battle at the  crucible one shouts out halt ye who approacheth the trial forge what is your business here  laura yes we are here to pay homage to earthbreaker groon 
none	 with the latest  champion of the city  matt of the city the city claims no champion  laura of the crucible you know  matt they glance at each other  liam the earthbreaker is a fan  matt chuckles i highly doubt that  orion tell him its grogs  marisha were not there  liam check your facts buddy he likes the cut of his jib believe you me  matt and the other one gets up to his side and stands there arms crossed looking down upon you  from three large stone steps up 
none	 with this look of im looking forward to throwing these guys out  about five minutes pass and the next one comes back and whispers in his ear very well the  four of you may enter briefly but this ones only invited to the center chamber the rest of you  must keep a distance a distance  laura oh yeah like what ten feet yeah  matt youll know he steps aside and the doors stone scraping slide open as you guys step into  the interior the smell that hits you immediately is that of sage and 
none	 other burned herbs that are  used ceremonially to cleanse a certain landscape of evil spirits from a superstitious standpoint but  also to build an atmosphere of meditation and understanding the one bastion that left and came  back and whispered in his ear comes up and leans into you guys and gives you a nod he doesnt  actually speak to you but he gives you a hand gesture to follow leads you into the trial  forge and you can see now these halls are essentially one long hallway its an arch about  85 to 100 
none	 feet up and the interior of it is built out of a very thick sturdy reddish stone you  dont know if the actual stone itself is built from a substance of this color or itself has been  stained or colored to match the rest of the kord reddish aesthetic but as you step in your  footfalls clack against a black marble floor with what looks like gold streaks through it almost  like there are small veins of some sort of gold material that has been polished within the actual  marble itself  laura very pretty 
none	  matt gives you a nod and a smile no words in response continues to gesture forth and as you  guys step in you see occasionally a few other individuals walking by with a similar gold and red  robe aesthetic that you saw earthbreaker wearing when he went to watch your battle in the crucible  however they are generally a little more dressed down very simple as opposed the expressive  designs that were billowing across the baggy leggings that the earthbreaker was wearing and  the robes as you continue forward they all step aside and 
none	 keep a quiet watch until you begin to  notice in the distance there are two large hallways that intersect you can see most of the  trial forge are now two long hallways that intersect into a center piece and the center  place of this temple there is a raised dais at three different levels and at the top of it you  can see there is a beam of light that comes down from above as you begin to walk towards the  structure you see there is a small figure that is currently sitting on top 
none	 of this central dais as  you approach the outskirts of this main central chamber where the two long hallways intersect the  quiet bastion puts his hand out and tells the rest of you to stop  gives you a look and nudges you to proceed  sam do you need us with you  travis what yeah you know i dont like talking  laura whispering hes not very good at talking would you like someone to come and  translate for him  liam is he going on his own then  laura is that a yes 
none	  sam good luck  laura okay sorry  travis i go forward  matt as you step forward footfalls clacking against the material  liam im sorry weve been daytime drinking and i hate to interrupt that do you have a place here  if i cant  sam i dont think they this is a temple  laura yeah this really not the kind of  liam are you sure  laura yeah  matt puts his hand out  laura they dont like talking  sam oh he has some sort of vow of silence we should 
dung	 respect it and also make fun of it when  hes gone  liam is that the end of that its fine whispering ive got a flask  matt as grog steps out in the central chamber you can hear his footfalls echoing throughout the  site and as you look up you can see now the light source from above there is what looks like  a stainedglass domed roof to the top of the central chamber there is a dark spot in the  center where you can see the shadow from the early afternoon sun is being 
none	 blocked from the  giant statue of kord that remains at the top of this temple who is currently essentially now  looking at the structure straddling the top of this giant domed stained glass roof and so  underneath this statue is where the top of this structure is and through it these beams of light  are coming down multicolored and cascading onto this central chamber sitting in the center you  see crosslegged arms to the side eyes closed there sits earthbreaker groon the dawn marshal  himself quiet as you approach  travis eyes closed  
none	 matt eyes closed  travis i step forward and say coughs sorry to disturb im looking for earthbreaker groon  matt you see an eyebrow twitch for a second eyes remain closed and the head turns for a second  hands come together like this and in that one motion stands to his feet almost like it was  effortless from what would seem like a very uncomfortable position suddenly is fully standing  with a swift movement in place rotates and turns towards you eyes still closed at which point the  eyes open and you saw pupils previously 
town	 but in this moment of what seems to be serious  meditation there is this luminescent white light that encompasses the entirety of each eye just  looking straight towards you the hands still clasped in the center  theyre staring straight at you  travis okay  matt you have found the earthbreaker what do you ask of me  travis i keep the little bit of pee thats about to fall out from falling out and i say i  happened to see you amongst the crowd at my recent tussle it seemed that everyone there seemed to 
none	  know who you were i wanted to at least introduce myself  matt you are grog the victorious  travis thats right coughs thats right  matt once called philip known as one of vox machina the travelling band from emon slayer of  demons that once usurped uriel himself i know of your travels i know of your deeds what else do  you ask of the earthbreaker  travis i dont really ask i only mean to say that vox machina is at your disposal if you would  ever need someone outside of the amazing braving 
none	 grounds vasselheim were really amazing  orion we know where theyre at right  marisha no  orion we dont know where theyre at  travis if you would just keep us in mind  matt at this point in time his eyelids close and they open again and theres a softness that  there wasnt before the white light has faded and you can now see beneath them these extremely  piercing very very light blue almost white irises that surround his pupils and from his old  weathered wrinkled face from underneath his beard you can see a 
dung	 smile slowly crawl across  his cheeks his hands release and rest to his side he lifts his head slightly as if to look  down at you from upon this dais not with judgment but with curiosity his voice echoes and  booms through this with even but a whisper from his throat once again saying your piety is  accepted perhaps there may be a use for kord of you and your compatriots in the future should  this day arise you will know and you must hurry dark times are ahead i can see the veils  
none	 twisting many many evil minds come to rend the peace apart there will be a day i call for you  grog the victorious stay alive  travis i mean to thank you it has been an honor being in your presence  matt he steps back to his position originally now go he turns around and sits back into his  meditate position and closes his eyes and disappears back into the same place where you  originally saw him  travis i turn around and i go guys his fucking eyes are glowing  liam whispers were not 
none	 here  laura whispers youve got to go  sam you kept it together great  travis thanks did you hear all of that  sam yeah i couldnt hear much but it was great  travis i almost had an aneurysm  liam he sounded very serious  travis yeah we should go hes cool  sam do you think i should shit somewhere  laura no just go  sam okay well just go then  travis yeah sans shit and were out  liam better be safe  sam better be safe  liam just a little 
none	 one  laura and travis no  sam no okay well just go  travis and we make our way out of the goldenfloored glowingeyed guys house  matt you are escorted out of the trial forge you eventually meet up with the rest of vox machina  you carrying to your side strapped a dried hogshead filled with black powder and a cart of  about 100 pounds of iron ingots  travis ooh you want me to hold onto all that for you  taliesin actually if you could just help load it onto the ship that would 
none	 be lovely  sam are we going on the airship  orion if we could fit it in the bag of holding it would be much better  taliesin sure certainly if we can put it in the bag of holding that would be fine  laura is that a pigs head  marisha it is literally a pigs head  taliesin i yes that is in fact a pigs head its complicated  sam lets find captain damon and get back on the ship  orion i start casting circle of teleportation  matt as you guys are having 
none	 this discussion you look over and you can see the airship which is a  not too hard to see from this distance is currently being outfitted actually being  finalized being outfitted with brand new ballistae remember those giant dragonheaded  ballistae you saw settled on the walls on the outskirts of vasselheim those have now been  affixed to the airship as the previous air encounter it had they didnt seem to quite cut  through the defenses you guys notice this just in time as you see a flash of light and you look  over your 
none	 shoulder and tiberius has finished drawing what looks to be a large sigil i fixed  my pronunciation in that thank you  sam i like siggle  matt i grew up with siggle and nevertheless i know sigil  liam since i came in at the halfway mark i really wanted to go to an ink specialist here in  vasselheim before we left so can we retcon and go backwards and say that i got the elven sounds for  vuh and mm put right there  laura tattooed on his fucking wrist  liam elven and then 
none	 over here i dont remember much of the mathematics that my teachers in our  homeland  sam wait are you saying that someone out there in the world should do the elven symbol for vm and  we should all get literally tattooed  liam no thats ridiculous but over here i have a mathematical shape i dont know if you know  arithmetic but i learned arithmetic when i was studying i learned knifework i learned elven  poetry and i learned arithmetic and i had a knack for it she didnt but i did and i would 
none	 like to  get a it was called an icosahedron right here  laura right here  liam right here  marisha wait are we all doing that together  sam in real life  marisha ill go with you  liam this is real life but to start  marisha you guys we got a little daydrunk lets go together come on  liam just me the symbol for vuh and mm in elven right there  matt all right so as youve had this done over the past few days as you were awaiting the return  of 
none	 the other team who went off against a white dragon apparently youve had the time to do so  you just havent quite revealed it to the rest of your allies yet  liam all right  matt all right but you guys look over your shoulder and as youre talking about taking an  airship tiberius has crafted a runic circle into the ground that itself is beginning to pulse with  arcane energy a familiar siggle one that you think actually  laura whispers sigil  matt sigil no i keep fucking it up i just happily fixed 
none	 it and then you caught me  liam thats pronounced coke and a cola  matt there we go the arcane sigil on the ground a familiar one that you once saw on the  beach of one underdark subterranean island  marisha down by the beach so that we have  laura down over by the bad lands  matt tiberius you are on the cusp of completing your ritual  orion oh i choose emon  matt all right the sigil flashes with arcane energy and opens up you see a small doorway  thats sparkling across the 
none	 ground  marisha hes just making the sigil  laura we can just pop over to emon  matt you can see the sigil shimmering as the energy is beginning to fade  travis we should go in  taliesin lets go  sam what about the airship what about captain damon  laura the airship was only going to take us to emon anyway  liam i walk right through it and say tiberius where are we going  orion emon i go through too  sam captain damon  orion ill hold it for a minute  laura 
none	 good thinking tiberius  marisha and i just jump in woohoo  matt you all leap through the sigil  taliesin i keep jumping into things  marisha i like jumping into things i like leap of faiths theyre exciting  matt you guys find yourself once again in a small white room familiar the place that was  your immediate sigh of relief when you returned from the underdark  marisha guys it feels good to be home  matt you push through the doorway returning once again to the 80foot circular chamber of white  stone where a 
none	 vibrant crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling there are five other doors  around the room and you are currently in the center of the traverse junction within the  alabaster lyceum  liam i mean we just did this it wasnt too long ago  laura so its okay we popped out is the same guy there  matt indeed gatekeeper xanthus is there waiting for you  marisha how long have we been gone  travis hold on tiberius wants to say something  orion to explain the travel schematic it would take us a few days to 
none	 come back on the airship to  this particular area if want to go back to kraghammer it would be much more efficient if we  teleport as we have and take a transport to kraghammer which is only north of here as well  which will only probably take a day right  laura five days  sam oh shit did we leave trinket  laura trinket is with us  orion airship from here  matt oh it is nearly a week to travel from emon to vasselheim in the airship yes  orion to kraghammer  matt 
none	 no to kraghammer from here its about a threeday travel on horseback  orion right the airship right  matt there is no airship to kraghammer  laura yeah but it would have dropped us off in emon anyway  orion so we just shaved off five days  sam good job tiberius  laura i pop on out and i say hello again  matt yes oh you youve returned  laura yes we have  matt well this time i would like you to fill out the proper paperwork  laura this time of course you already know 
none	 ahead of time that we are dear friends of uriel  and we do not need to  matt that is not true i had my ass chewed out by headmaster thurmond the last time you came  through and told me that so and he fumbles underneath his desk boof slams down what looks  to be a cluster of about 20 to 25 papers i require you to fill these out so i do not lose my  job here in the lyceum  liam all right vax pulls it over and starts filling it out and says 
none	 all right but you know  were kind of a big deal here  laura i was saying percy is so good at paperwork  orion i can split the load  marisha i thought we had a lawyer for this i thought we had burt reynolds esquire  orion were doing the paperwork  liam ive got it burt just because you didnt like paperwork or elven doesnt mean i dont  ive got it but uriels not going to be pleased  laura hes going to be super pissed  liam but dont worry ill do it  
none	 matt i look forward to it great  orion well there you are and heres my  sam do you have a bathroom around here  orion oh scanlan hold it  matt down the hall to the left  sam all right i might make it  liam vax fills out the entire thing except for the final signature and says scanlan could you  put the final signature on this  orion notarize it  laura tiberius is helping  sam oh boy buttoning up my fly final signature ill just sign my name  liam that works

none	 sam dont worry i shat in the hallway  laura what time of day is it  matt as you guys leave the lyceum you enter the main courtyard that leads into it you are  currently within the cloudtop district of emon a clear blue sky dotted with clouds ahead of you  you gather its probably around 200 or 300 in the afternoon no time has passed since the  travel was instantaneous thanks to teleportation  laura you are so good you  taliesin why dont we take a day or two to recuperate and then make 
tavern	 our way to kraghammer  marisha we are officially drunk in two different cities  laura im not drunk  sam is our next destination kraghammer  orion yes collect our money  sam lets take a night and then go set off in the morning  orion what time is it right now in the day  matt its about 4pm  orion could we ride maybe drunk riding  marisha well whining we havent been home in so long  orion we can go to the keep and say hi to everyone  marisha i need to water 
none	 the garden its probably half dead  orion no we have servants that do that  sam to the keep  taliesin and travis to the keep  matt all right you guys make your way through the cloudtop district to the southern edge of  emon to the lower slums outside of the city along the southern wall to greyskull keep the  visual is welcoming it looks standing clean and in the distance you can see a figure walking  across the top of the wall keeping watch as you get closer you can see it is the 
town	 image of  cordell the halforc individual that you guys hired along with shayne as you approach the front  gate you see what looks like a tent a large thick burlap or linen brown tent is set up right  outside of you guys  liam that wasnt there before  laura what what is that  sam cordell cordell what is this tent  matt cordell is looking over the edge as you approach and he gives you a wave hello and you  can see shayne runs up next to him off the top she has her 
town	 crossbow at the ready she goes oh  finally youve arrived im so glad you could make it yes this has been here for about two  weeks now  sam is someone inside of it  matt at which point you hear sudden rustling from inside of the tent and a face pops out  briefly you can see what looks like humanoid features and suddenly darts back inside and you  hear more rustling it sounds like pots and metals clinking around  laura i immediately go over there and throw open the  matt as you throw 
town	 open the tent at that moment you see another person is pushing out of the tent  and you both have this awkward moment where you both awkward noises and he pushes off of you  instinctively and rights himself the tent half collapses behind him and he catches himself and  stands there at the ready you see before you what looks to be a young man probably in his late  teens 19 to 20 years old haphazardly dressed in scale mail armor a longsword crossbow and  handaxe and buckler all dangling from his belts weighing him

none	 tearing it down and you can see the tears are still coming but hes  steeled his expression  liam i walk over to him these people cant hear this i kneel down next to him and i put my hand  on his shoulder and say i was once like you and didnt know what i wanted or where i was going i  just want you to be ready weve got some shit to do when we come back well start over youre  starting from ground zero starting from the basement youll work your way up and

none	 guys after all this time he takes the rest of  his stuff and holds it in one arm and darts off down the path towards the river hops over it and  then makes his way towards the rest of emon and vanishes into the distance  marisha you know you might have just sent him to his death  laura why did you have to knock him out  liam to go home and train  laura we could have trained him  liam we almost died ourselves in that temple in that pyramid  marisha you just 
none	 put expectations in his head  orion are they inside yet  laura yeah were walking inside  liam so we should have made him a fullfledged member today right now  marisha no thats not what im saying at all  liam make him a butler he doesnt want to do that  matt as you guys are having this conversation you turn into the entrance of the keep and there  standing arms behind his back is tiberius seriousfaced  orion i look right at vax why did you do that to that young man  liam he 
none	 wasnt ready  orion stop it it was aggressive beyond necessity we should have trialed the boy  marisha that was his trial  orion that was not a trial  sam well see if he comes back  orion you are far more powerful vax you know that this boy was a fan at best we could have  put him to work or something  marisha do you think he would have been happy with work im not even happy that he told him to  go off and continue training i think telling him to go off 
none	 and continue training is a bad idea  liam he now knows the facts he knows his skill level he knows where he stands he will either go  back to being a fishmonger  sam son of a butcher  liam son of a butcher well everyone has their own personal path or he will come back to me and  if he comes back to me i will train him if not it wasnt meant to be  orion and if he comes for your head  laura he wont  travis oh he wont  liam ill 
none	 deal with that as well  travis did you never see the incredibles  laughter  orion vax  liam yes tiberius  orion you and grog i respect and fear the most out of all of us you are cunning  sam what am i chopped liver  orion i could crush you in one blow scanlan  sam lets leave it at that  orion vex i fear you and am slightly attracted to you as well grog and vax you are the  strongest and most noble and cunning  sam you live because i let you 
none	 live just needed to say that out loud  orion you believe what you believe im just saying when it comes to things sometimes you  really rush into stuff and stop because you could just be chill sometimes  laughter  matt at which point you hear a voice ring out from across the courtyard of the keep ah youve  all returned and you see across the way laina your joyful housekeeper comes rushing out arms  open to greet you all you can see theres a little bit of dirt on the front of her apron like 
none	  shes been cutting the hedges or doing some sort of garden work she rushes out and hugs you its  been so long its been far too long its so good to see all of you  orion as i see her i turn to greet but i want to give vax a little pinch on the butt a little  friendly pinch  matt a little tweak a little dragonborn tweak oh sorry that reminds me hold on and she  pulls out a little piece of paper you recognize it its used in various arcane messaging she 
none	  pulls out a small quill and dabbles it and starts writing a quick message on it closes the lid  fire burst noise it disappears  marisha what was that  matt im sorry i was given that just in case you all returned  marisha who gave you that what was that  matt seeker asum emring of the council the ranger he said as soon as you all returned im  supposed to let him know he had very important business with you  laura maybe for the future dont do that until we tell you its 
none	 okay to do that  sam seeker emring you said of the council of taldorei  matt yes  sam hes an ally  laura no hes fine its just maybe we wanted to take a little nap or something  marisha yes ask us first  matt im sorry i was oh okay my apologies i was given implicit instructions by him  orion its all right we forgive you i give her a hug sorry im very scaly  matt oh ah its good to see you too lord tiberius stormwind  sam could you instruct the security 
town	 guard we can take care of it we should instruct the  security guards if theres a tent outside the keep they should just burn it down  matt oh that nice boy i brought him biscuits every morning he was so sweet that one  marisha you brought him biscuits oh she fed the stray thats adorable  liam do me a favor roll up his tent keep it inside if he comes back to ask for it  matt he already rolled up his tent when he took off  liam did he leave anything  matt there 
none	 was a couple of small pots and pans and things that he left  liam if he comes back let him in if im not here let him use my room for as long as he likes  and ill pay for it  matt okay itll be done  laura feeling guilty that you knocked him out brother  liam no i feel perfectly justified  orion oh you shouldnt  travis can we rest before we go see this ranger  sam lets do it  matt right you guys make your way into the keep laina immediately 
none	 rushes off to the kitchen and begins  preparing a welcome back meal for all of you you can smell after the next ten to 15 minutes pass  by that scent of freshlycooked meats and baking bread begins to fill the air around greyskull  keep the halls are kept nice and warm its very clean and its a very welcome sight to be back  home you take time to rest and exhale and go over the sequence and as you walk by you see across  the right from the main foyer you can see a little 
none	 bit of the light echoing through from the  temple of sarenrae the stained glass itself and for a moment you all take a sad memory of pike  whereever she is hopefully to return to you very soon  marisha its just not home without her  laura heres the thing scanlan how do you look through your poo can you look through it  anywhere or is it perhaps from the  sam if youd like to im feeling a little bit pikesick right now  i could concentrate very hard  laura just concentrate for a moment 
none	 and see what shes doing  liam would we be able to see as well  sam no id have to describe to you what i see  laura tell us what you see unless shes naked in which case stop looking  sam of course i would definitely stop looking if i saw her naked in front of my poo definitely  matt are you  sam sure im going to try to scry through my poo  matt you sit down and close your eyes and begin to concentrate and as you begin to focus your  energy 
none	 the sense of the arcane mind itself has gathered between the center of the head and the  center of the chest you begin to join these in the center and your consciousness begins to glide  downward towards your bowels eventually you find a point of connection and you feel your vision  transcending this single point on the prime material plane you are brought through the small  channel across the astral sea to connect and suddenly your vision takes place what looks like  a cluster of dirt to one side and a darkened chamber that is 
none	 lit by a series of torches before  you you see still and slightly muddled the temple of sarenrae as partially uncovered you can  see the large stone archway that is the front of the partially collapsed temple you can see now  there is stone being brought down the wooden staircase and it is being used to slowly build up  and reconstruct what was once a beautiful and very wellrevered structure you can see in the  distance a small whitehaired gnome figure that is currently acting as foreman for this whole  construction process and is 
none	 giving orders and shouts to the other individuals here glancing  about you see her step over and one person trips and drops a stone and she walks up to them and  takes them by the shoulder and lifts them back up and gives them a little hug and then picks up the  stone and carries it with them over to where it belongs on the side of one of the walls  sam she should fire that person but okay  matt a few more moments pass and you gather that this is a slowmoving but a 
none	 consistent moving  renovation of the temple of sarenrae based on the limited number of people that she has at her  disposal to help with the process but it seems to be going well  sam gasps  laura what did you see  sam she was definitely naked  orion really  sam no she was supervising her crew in a fair but firm way she was just being pike driven  radiant beautiful and empowered by the spirit of  sarenrae shes everything that we think of her  and more shes beautiful and charming lets just 
none	 let it be known that i could kill tiberius if  i wanted to just going to say that  orion its fine yes you can scanlan  sam yes i mean thats beside the point pike was glorious and wonderful and confident and i  miss her so much i hope from time to time i can look in on her  laura anytime you want  travis look through your shit  sam well its really any bodily fluid i believe i could piss i could barf  laura ooh any time ever  travis is this real 
none	 is it a real thing is it real he can do this  matt there is a gradual fade to the effect  liam im raising my flask and i say to pike  all to pike  liam the best in all of us  sam she really was and is  marisha our own little inspirational poster inside each and every one of us  sam shes not little but yes  matt as you all drink a familiar voice echoes from across the hallway  marisha pike  matt your food is ready everyone  groaning  
none	 matt and you see erwen dastell your elderly halfling manservant is there standing in his  attire smiling happy to see you all laina would like you all to know that your meal is  ready this way please  laura thank you erwen  matt he leads you to the dining hall the food is already prepared and you sit down to eat the  meal is very welcome its the best food youve had in a while comparable to southern comfort  food theres gravy biscuits its beautiful  laura fried chicken  matt chuckles its delightful a 
none	 little ways into the meal you can see cordell steps into the  room and glances in for a second i am sorry to interrupt but we have a visitor  sam is it a councilor from taldorei  matt it is the halfling  orion invite him in for dinner  laura does he want some fried chicken  matt i could ask  marisha tell him if hes okay with us being a little tipsy  laura still  marisha well i figured we just kept going  matt a moment goes by and you see seeker asum 
dung	 emring arrives at the doorway hes wearing dark  looks like studded leather armor a very deep green cloak about his shoulders even at the  council meetings hes dressed for utility he seems to be that individual who has his eye in  many places in the room at once hes a ranger by trade and paranoid by nature his head is shaved  bald and he has tattoos across one side of his halfling face as he walks in he gives a swift  bow and says to everyone greetings im sorry to interrupt your meal i was 
none	 notified that you have  arrived and i have business i would like to discuss if you have a moment  marisha groans is it bad news were not in the mood for bad news  matt im all right its not bad news its just something i wanted to run by the rest of you  travis please feel free to speak  matt he steps and finds a chair at one of the nearby tables clustered towards the center  where you guys have pushed your dining tables together now while you were gone a venture has  
none	 been put into motion in celebration of the agreedupon construction of a grand bridge across  the shearing channel to the eastern continent of wynandia a dinner is being held here within a  week this venture is helmed by one lord and lady briarwood of whitestone as the bridge would be  set at the edge of the alabaster sierras they are probably en route as we speak the bridge shall  open trade routes with the kingdom of wildmount across the way im here because few things escape  my eye percival when last we were company you 
none	 had shifted so very uncomfortably at the mention  of these two may i ask why  taliesin had i i hadnt noticed  matt well i did  taliesin i have had dealings with them before i find them untrustworthy  matt i have my reservations as well my network has been watching their acquisition of whitestone  since the de rolo family fell to disease and there are far more questions than answers ive  sent operatives to inquire but each has sent me a letter of resignation instead of choosing to stay  within whitestone under my 
none	 employ now our sovereign requested that i extend an invitation to this  coming dinner per your request to him percy to you vox machina i am here to ask if you will  attend and if so if i can trust you to keep an eye while i do my work  laura what say you percy  travis its percys call  taliesin sighs yes we will attend  matt very good i will contact you in the next few days and shall discuss further until then  enjoy the rest of your meal and thank you he

none	 but two steps and for a second you swear he was walking he had about 15  feet to the door and hes just gone  laura hes good  matt and with that we shall end this weeks session  groaning  laura oh but i want to talk to percy  marisha i know percy just ran off to the basement to his workshop  matt well pick up directly from this moment next week  marisha guys i feel like we need to have a conversation with percy  laura yeah that needs to happen  taliesin
