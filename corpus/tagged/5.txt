right good its getting you in character perfect so now weve finished all the  announcements i believe if anyone has anything else were going to go /town/ ahead and get into  tonights episode of critical role so where we left off our intrepid adventurers vox machina having  returned the traitor riskel daxio to sovereign uriel in the center of the town of emon grog  beheading him as part of his punishment for being such a traitorous worshiper of the evil entity  known as vecna upon going out for a pub crawl came across gilmore in a secret speakeasy managed  to enjoy a heroes feast at his expense whereas vex and vax both all of you got pretty keyleth  got very drunk /tavern/  laura i didnt get drunk at all  matt thats right you didnt drink  marisha i got pretty wasted  matt gilmore had a very intense conversation with vax over there to ensure where they stood and  keyleth vomited multiple times but after which the party found their way back to the keep where  dr dranzel and his spectacular traveling troupe were drinking and expecting you to be there in  which they could converse and try and convince you of a little caper theyve been trying to get their  head around for a while /none/ and you seem to have the entry to this possible windfall of money scanlan  after courting this young pixiehaired gnome  sam i sort of knew in the back of my head right no i was courting her no its true  laughter  matt was instead confronted in his bedroom by kaylie who revealed herself to be scanlans  longunknown daughter from many years ago who had trained very hard as a bard at the college of the  white duke in westruun and honed her skills with a blade with the intent of finding you one day /none/ and  disgracing you thanks to scanlans sudden realization change of heart and attempt to  connect with his lost blood broke a bit of that cold honed exterior and managed to prevent a very  dangerous and possibly deadly encounter she left frustrated and confused and hasnt been seen  since the rest of you gathering the next morning discussed this endeavor with dr dranzel  and how they had found a home that had been long abandoned after being purchased by a collector a  home that you guys had ransacked a little over a year before after /none/ finding a portal within that  led to a dragons hoard as the previous person who lived there general krieg was actually a  dragon who had infiltrated the council  laura a really hot dragon i remember thinking he was really cute i had a thing for general krieg  i was really sad when it turned out he was  matt im sorry it worked out that way  matt yeah that was grogs famous rage looting general krieg bonescythe brimscythe sorry  theyre close brimscythe the dragon was slaughtered in this endeavor however its been  over /none/ a year since you guys returned to this house scoured it found your way through the still  existing secret passage that led you to the now partially collapsed cavern which once housed  brimscythe and his hoard you found that the tunnel itself freezing cold the rubble of the  partially collapsed cavern had been ravaged by some sort of large clawed entity that vex had  identified as another equally dangerous dragon that seems to have rummaged through and found the  corpse of brimscythe you also found that a number of gold coins a bit of his /none/ hoard that had been  buried in this were now exposed by these strange smooth tunnels that were carved into the rock  upon you scanlan and trinket inquiring there the rest of the party scattered pike and keyleth  went to find what seemed to be the owner of the house now frozen in fright in a far alcove and  the three the rest of your group traveling towards the mouth of the cavern itself before the  ground begins to rumble suddenly exploding from the rock and shale of the bottom of the cavern  floor you /dung/ guys managed to see before you piercing forth from the ground itself a very very large  segmented armored wormlike entity  sam armored  matt the actual hide itself is like very very thick  laura super thick ugh  sam like with armor  matt not with armor just this natural sense  laura when we kill it we can make armor out of him  liam and it was pale and icy too i think you were describing  matt it was darkish purple in its color and tint like dark blacks purple with rows and rows /none/ of  teeth coming out of its eyeless face as it bursts out of the surface i need you all to roll  initiative  laura no  sam oh my god right away right away were just in it just like that  travis fuck yeah  matt all right so 25 to 20  travis 20 to kill scanlan  laughter  matt 20 to 15  marisha 19  sam thats it  liam 15  matt 15 to ten  taliesin ten  sam 11  matt all right then comes ten to five  laura /none/ nine  matt and pike while as shes not here rolled the lowest ashley unfortunately due to  scheduling could not be here this evening so far were hoping she might show up at some point  tonight well find out but in the meantime im going to be running pike on my end so starting  the encounter as you see this giant worm creature through the tunnel the three of you now walking  the other direction you feeling the rumble  turn around holding forth your greatsword  unsheathed you can feel the power pulsing with each /none/ beat of your blood through your body as a  little voice in the back of your head stemming from your weapon goes kill youre up grog  travis well i hope youre hungry but you have to wait one second were a bit far away can i  travel as far as i can towards  matt speed of 50 i believe  travis 50  laura oh i said i hid at the end of the episode i said i hid  matt right roll stealth  travis do i have a line of sight with him or /none/ is the edge of that outcropping blocking it  matt he would have half cover if you were to try and like throw your weapon at him itd be a plus  five to his armor class  marisha pike and i are hiding too  matt okay stealth check for both of you  travis could i back up three squares so that i could move to my left so i could get a straight  look at him  matt there you mean  travis can i go one more  matt thats the extent of your movement /none/ right there unfortunately unless you want to go at  this angle there there you go  travis can i use the javelin of lightning  sam what the fuck is that thats a thing you made up  travis oh yeah ive got it i utter the magic word penelope and i throw it and each creature  in the line excluding me and the target must make a dc 13 dexterity saving throw  matt okay there are no creatures in the line just the target  travis just the target then  liam did you get that /none/ in yugvoril  travis huh  liam yugvoril is it from yugvoril  travis i dont remember its just in the bag  liam in yugvoril at the bottom of that pit when he headbutted the giant  matt yup that was in the rubble  liam yeah ding  matt good memory  travis can i try and throw it  matt you may go for it  travis 18  matt 18 total 18 just hits so go ahead and roll damage for the javelin as you rear back  aim it with your eyes and the frustration /none/ is palpable from craven edge as you put it aside to  throw the javelin instead as it arcs into a bolt of energy that streaks forth slams into the hide  of the giant purple worm go ahead and roll damage  travis 19  matt 19 all righty great it rears in place shakes itself for a second it has no eyes so  its not looking in any different direction it just seems to be flailing in its current  location  travis can i go into a rage  matt yes you may  travis i /none/ would like to rage  matt all right laughs  laura are you rolling your special dice  matt as you bite your lower lip you feel and taste the blood begin to enter your mouth and at  that point the heat in the back of your shoulders and neck begins to swell up grogs into a rage  that ends your turn keyleth youre up  marisha can i do like a nature check on this thing to see if i can discern any type of  information on it  matt sure go ahead and make an /none/ intelligence check  marisha just straight intelligence thats not good i think that is a five six six  matt six you have no recollection of this type of an entity in your travels its definitely not  natural its not of nature and youve seen various types of eyeless wormtype creatures but  nowhere near on this scale so yeah you have no idea beyond that  marisha im just going to whisper to pike and be like it doesnt have any eyes i feel like we  shouldnt move  matt she goes okay and she gets as /none/ still as she possibly can its good movings not my forte  marisha okay i like hold her shoulder pads so she doesnt clink any  matt okay  marisha okay im going to stay right here  matt all right so that ends your turn vax youre up unless you want to do something else on  your turn is that it  marisha im just im just going to i dont want to move im just going to wait  sam mocking i dont want to i dont want to move  marisha i dont want to move /none/  liam click the boots of haste and i want to go stealth and scoot to that column past grog but  closer to the worm not that one the next one yeah i think i can make it there  matt all right you can get there  liam do i need to roll stealth  matt you can roll stealth yeah  liam i want to throw a dagger at it yeah that is 28  matt all right that definitely hits however it is not sneak attack damage you are hiding  definitely behind the pillar but /none/ your footsteps and you get the essence as soon as you see the  creature its head follows you across the room you get the sense immediately that it is not a  sightbased creature it is definitely a movementbased creature and its head just follows  you as you move  liam ill defer but let me ask going stealth and rolling a 28 on stealth the footsteps were  still enough to alert it to where i was  matt is it a natural 20  liam i didnt attack yet no it was a combined 28 just /none/ to go stealth  matt a combined 28 right even so not quite light enough not with the knowledge that it was  an issue with this entity and due to the proximity of it and it being a very sensitive  creature to the rocks movement it still picks you up  liam and i should have one attack i should have an attack right because i did the boots i ran  over here  matt yep so you have an attack  liam two  matt well two attacks you have offhand so yeah  liam two /none/ yeah two because it was double the speed because of the boots all right first one  is shit that is 14 and the second one is im going to do luck on that the second one is 20  matt the second one hits the first one unfortunately just bounces off of its hide  liam thats not a lot but it is seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage got it  liam first blood first blood everyone  sam its looking pretty beat up  matt all right at this point in time the /none/ dagger embeds itself in you see the hilt sinks into the  hide and then vanishes in a puff of smoke as it returns to your belt however you can see a little  bit of black liquid pouring forth from it and its head has been trained on you since you moved across the  room the worm now disappears beneath the ground  taliesin not cool  matt and you feel the ground beneath you begin to shake as it bursts out of the ground thats a 20  to hit  liam 20 can i use evasion /none/ or no  matt to reduce the damage in half if you want huh whats your ac  liam oh with the boots on 18  matt it rolled a 20  liam yeah i know so tell me what happens  matt so as you look around you all of a sudden the jaws start coming up out of the ground behind  you the teeth biting into your body as you try and wrest yourself away from its grip you take 20  points of piercing damage  liam oh well uncanny dodge right evasion is for spell /none/ effects  matt right evasion does not help you in this circumstance uncanny dodge allows you to reduce  the damage by half so yes you can do that so you take ten damage instead i need you to make a  dexterity saving throw  liam thats okay all right so okay natural 20  matt as the jaws attempt to clamp around you you manage to just pull yourself away tearing your  knees across the teeth but rolling in the opposite direction right in the place where you  were as it bursts out of the ground /none/ just beside you and rights itself around in that direction as  its full body emerges now you can see its tail flop out of the tunnel it just made with this  giant hooked stinger on the end as it whips off in your direction that is going to be a 15 to hit  travis thatll miss  matt that misses you as the stinger swings towards you you manage to just duck out of the  way your eyes trained on it in an absolute red fury and it just whiffs past your face  sam couldve /none/ been bad couldve been bad  matt that ends its turn scanlan youre up  sam whos in front of me  matt right now youre next to trinket and vex is behind you  laura laughing dont be a dick  sam im not going to be a dick i brush past trinket so i can see the worm  matt okay about there you can see it from that perspective  sam okay i hold up my cone my hand cone of clarity and i will cast eyebite singing to it  singing scanlans eyes are biting you /none/ making you very sick ooh scanlans eyes are biting you  scanlans eyes all right so the eyebite refers to my eyes he doesnt need eyes he doesnt need  to be able to see me i have to be able to see him right it works okay so im going to do  sicken  matt to sicken it all right all right it rolls this is a wisdom saving throw it rolls an  eight so yeah it does not succeed on that eyebite takes hold get this little marker on  there on its neck like a /none/ little there we go so as your spell completes on it you can see its  form contracts for a second and its head hangs a little less strong as it did previously it  almost goes slack for a moment from the impact of the spell affecting its physical form all right  so it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for as long as it lasts all right so  thats your movement thats your action any bonus actions  sam i will inspire vex with a limerick  laura i cant wait  sam i /none/ once knew a bear named trinket and would often tell you he stinket but you were appalled  so you kicked me in the balls and now i dont say it i just think it  laughter  laura that was wonderful  matt a d10 inspiration die to you vex  laura yay  liam plus or minus  matt laughs well see  marisha am i able to take a bonus action to like shout something out over comms  matt ill allow it since you held your turn this turn anyways yeah  marisha yeah everyone should /none/ try and get a little bit so i can see you and i can make us all fly  laura shouting what you can make us fly  marisha i learned it today but you have to be within 30 feet of me  laura oh really but im so far away from you  marisha you know imagine i said it more succinctly than this  matt laughs thats as much as you can get out percy youre up  taliesin all right im going to head in the direction of the message i just received so im  /none/ going to crawl around the bottom there  laura ugh im not going to be able to get to her  matt thats as far as you can get  taliesin thats as far as i can get thats fine im going to take a couple shots with the big  gun im going to bad news this so lets take a shot at that guy yeah thats reasonable range  yeah okay not too close thats not bad 21  matt 21 hits  taliesin 28 points of damage  matt okay  taliesin quick reload going to get /none/ one more shot off and im going to take this one with the  sharpshooter effect just to see how things go  matt sure the sharpshooter effect you mean the deadeye  taliesin yep yeah the deadeye the negative five to hit  matt oh got you got you all right  taliesin 14  matt 14 does not hit unfortunately as you load the second round you pull bad news in front of  you and you go to fire the ground actually shakes beneath you theres a quaking not sure if its  from the creature or /dung/ just the atmosphere around you but as you do the gun just misfires and  well it actually doesnt misfire but it fires off into one of the side elements of the cave and  you hear it ricochet off the rock  taliesin thats what i got  matt all right thats 28 damage 28 damage is not bad  all right vex youre up  laura okay will you be able to move forward  marisha yeah  laura okay im going to send trinket up to that little alcove keep running no a little  further a /none/ little further  matt thats whats trinkets movement is it 40 so he can go there  laura thats as close as he can get to you  matt six actually seven eight so thatd be the full movement  laura okay get him tucked into that little side  matt trinket is now stepping onto a bit of slick of ice and is like unbalanced bear noises but  seems to be okay at the moment  laura okay and then i move forward so i can see him right there all right and im going to  hunters /none/ mark him and then im going to shoot my longbow of the sky sentinel at him so that im  going to shoot an arrow and it divides into three arrows and they all turn into storm arrows so i  roll an attack for each one of those for my first attack  matt correct yep yep as you release the arrow from the actual tension of the bow as soon as it  leaves your fingers it almost burns the tips as it races into this arrow of pure energy as it  divides in the middle of /none/ the air you can see each arrow sparking off bits of electrical power on its  laura okay so the first one is a 26  matt hits  laura should i roll damage for that one  matt roll to see how many hit  laura the second one is a 29  matt hits  laura the third one is a 20  matt 20 hits yeah all three hit  liam this is all happening in less than six seconds  laura 17 20 23 for the first arrow  matt all righty  laura nine ten /none/ 11 13 17 for the second one and then 14 15 16  sam i feel bad for this thing  laura 22 20 what is that 27 for the third  matt oof all right as each arrow slams into its side you can see portions of its large  chitinous almost like armored shell crack and break open and you can see now these streams of  black worm blood are spilling down its side and it starts shaking in place now in pain  laura okay im going to shoot through my blazing bowstring for my second /none/ attack  matt all right  sam second attack  laura yeah that was just one  matt yeah she gets that once a day  laura 25  matt 25 hits  travis you have more dice than that dice store  laura i know its ridiculous 16 16 19 and then an additional d10 so 19 of fire damage so  25 for the third  matt 25 oof that is a nasty round well done  laura for the fourth arrow  matt as this fourth arrow slams into its side theres a burst of fire from /none/  the impact and you can see it now its starting to shriek this horrible highpitched multitoned  scream all right that ends your turn  laura and i rolled a 15 for stealth not that it probably matters anymore  matt nah no it doesnt really all right  laura and then i stay very very still  matt cool so does pike pikes going to follow in keyleths order and spend the round just  keeping in place very quietly all right top of the round again grog youre up  travis oh are we flying  all /none/ no  travis fuck it i take craven edge out i hope youre hungry and i would like to go into a  frenzied rage  matt all right  travis and i would like to attack the first two times at the big purple dick that just came out  of the ground  matt all right  marisha hey move down a bit so youre not in my way  travis which way  matt grogs just charging in  travis thats a 23  matt 23 hits  travis 20  matt 20 hits  travis wow /none/ 26  matt all three hit these are nongreat weapon master right  travis the third one i wanted it to be should i reroll since i didnt specify  matt reroll because you didnt say it yeah  travis 17  matt that misses unfortunately but the first two do hit yeah you got to mention that before  you make the attack  travis i do i do youre right 2d6 what do sixes look like theyre squares  laura theyre squares  laughter  sam cubes really  travis jeez three eight 16 for the first one /none/  matt all righty  travis and 16 for the second one  matt all righty whats the dc on the sword effect again is it 12  travis oh yep  matt all right so it succeeds its first saving throw and it succeeds its second saving throw but  you do see with each strike the intent of the sword to draw some of the strength and life force  from the target not really making any effect unfortunately all right ending your turn grog  that vibration you feel in the ground now its curious because the /none/ worm itself is out of the  ground now what caused you to lose your shot you feel it grow stronger and stronger before  suddenly nearby a secondary differentlooking but similar in size worm comes bursting out of  the base of the cavern  laura matthew mercer youre trying to kill us  matt you can see now as this bursts out its similar in size but different this one has a  thicker body its a purple and white type exterior and you can see frozen mist is just  emanating from the outside of its open /none/ jaw  laura no this is the one that pukes ice  marisha laughs pukes ice  laura this is what made the dude frozen  matt as this one rears back opens its jaw and a burst of cold air and ice shards comes spraying  out of its mouth  laura look at this cone you have  matt heading towards these actually it would get the other worm too  laura yes yes freeze the other worm  matt i need a constitution saving throw from grog and vax  liam i want to do an evasion /none/ thats an area effect  matt yeah  liam yeah  matt make your constitution saving throw  liam all right laughs do i do the dex save first or  matt its not a dex save constitution save  liam oh its not an area effect all right whatever you say natural 20  travis 21  matt 21 all right good  travis saving throw right constitution  matt constitution saving throw so read your ability real fast does it affect only dex saves  liam evasion on dex save ive written an abbreviated version of this its /none/ area of effect  if its like fireball or anything thats in an area  matt right but i think it may specify whether or not  liam oh but youre god what do you want me to do  matt im just looking it up right now give me a second  travis ooh i have danger sense i have advantage on dexterity saving throws  matt this is not dexterity this is constitution  sam oh but you know what i have really good dexterity  matt yep dexterity saving throw so this does not affect this attack /none/ sorry all right so you  both take half damage as does the creature  taliesin thats a lot of rolling  sam hes only rolling a d2 hes rolling a d2  matt all right thats 40 points of damage halved thats 20 points of cold damage to each of  you and the purple worm  liam wait 40 or 20  travis holy shit  laura it does 40 points  liam can i do uncanny this is a new round can i do uncanny or not yet  matt it has not gotten back to your /none/ turn so no  laura were going to die  travis no were good shut up were fine  matt all right now its keyleths turn  marisha heres what i want to try and do i want to try and hope to god i can get everyone in here  liam shake that hangover off kiki  marisha i wanted to oh wait im trying to point the fucking point  the laser at the screen  matt yeah dont point at the screen point it at the actual map thats okay  marisha i want to try and /none/ go five ten 15 can i go through grog through there  matt you can try to yeah  laura youre going to go past the worm though  marisha can i go there wait wait back closer to the i want to be able to try and can i see  scanlan and stuff over there  matt you can see scanlan you can see pretty much everybody but trinket from this perspective and  you cant see pike  laura shit  marisha all right  laura thought i was helping  marisha everyone i guess whos within /none/ 30 range of me im going to do a wind blast and we all  turn into poofy cloud versions of ourselves  matt which one is this  marisha wind walk poofy cloud so as i run past grog i brush his shoulder and he turns into a  mist form and i turn into a mist form and then i blast it out and everyones mist form  matt all right cool so while in mist form you guys have a flying speed of 300 feet you have  resistance to nonmagical weapons you can only dash  /none/ marisha oh you cant attack  matt no youve got to read your spell you can take a minute to revert your form but as of right  now all of you guys currently everyone within 30 feet  sam im not within 30 feet  matt you can see within range so you cant see pike youve got to read the spell does not  affect trinket because you cant see trinket doesnt affect you guys scanlan is just out of  range so vex and scanlan youre unaffected you watch half of the party turn into these gaseous /none/  forms  sam oh my god the worms have turned us all into clouds  laura youve left us stranded were going to die  marisha no were still there  matt it takes a minute to revert to your actual form to be able to do any sort of attack  marisha man that was going to be way cooler if we could still  taliesin im going to do something insane ive got some plans  marisha it was a 6thlevel spell  matt i know  sam it was so good  marisha thanks guys i /none/ feel so validated  liam she just learned it yesterday  marisha i did just learn it yesterday  matt vax its your turn  liam and im made of wind  matt youre made of wind you can move you can dash or you can begin to revert if youd like  liam i can begin to revert so its a minutelong process that i have to consciously decide and i  know this  matt you get the feeling that if you want to return it will take you a while because you dont  really know what /none/ to do with your form  marisha we could try and get the fuck out of here  liam im going to use disengage and im going to fart over towards my sister and pike  matt you cannot disengage you can only dash in this form  liam oh then im going to dash towards my sister and pike  laura pike is on the other side me and scanlan  liam oh scanlan and vex sorry  matt so you move over  sam not all short people look alike  matt you dash over here that guys /none/ going to take an attack of opportunity on you hes going to  have disadvantage technically because you all of a sudden stopped moving and it just hears the  sound it rolled a three no it whips past you with its mouth biting at nothing  liam i want to land and then start thinking god i wish i was not made of farts and start trying  to undo whatever this is  matt okay ten rounds later you will be a physical entity  laura ten rounds  matt a minute  liam dispel magic little man /none/  laura okay can i see him can i shoot through him  matt you can shoot through him hell take half damage  liam im crouching  marisha we could use this to our advantage and get the fuck away so i dont feel like i just  wasted a 6thlevel spell just want to say  liam fog of war man  matt do you have dispel magic scanlan  sam that would have been great  laughter  matt sorry  marisha i technically do but fuck that  laura you can float up to the ceiling /none/ and then attack from high  marisha i did learn dispel magic but  sam well dispel your own shit  marisha no figure it out make it work for yourselves assholes that was a 6thlevel spell  god damn it  matt did you make yourself mist as well  marisha yeah its ten people  matt you cant cast a spell in mist form either  marisha were all shit out of luck how does that feel  matt so whos left currently that finishes vaxs turn  liam everyone whos a cloud were floating back to emon /none/ lets go  taliesin singing i can show you the world  marisha i thought we could still attack which would be way dope  matt that would be dope but that would be way too powerful a spell for sixth level this is more  of a means of travel spell or a means of escape spell  liam lets solve the problem  laura but half of the party is still not able to escape  marisha if you dont move theyll go away  matt this creature now having been hit by the terrifying eyebite spell its /none/ insides churning and  the impact from damage its taken its looking like it had a harsh round last turn as all of the  movement suddenly poof vanishes and theres no general movement the last thing it recalls that  was in its vicinity and still shifting with a heartbeat across the ground is you scanlan  impact noise it bursts out of the ground right in front of you it brings its jaw down over the  top with disadvantage thats a natural 20 so thank god it has disadvantage 19  sam im going to use cutting /none/ words to try and not have it hit me  matt okay  sam ill sing singing do you really want to hurt me do you really want to bite my body okay  that taunts him  matt okay go ahead and roll a d10 to reduce that from the attack  sam a d10 this one wait thats yours why am i doing yours  matt thats a 19 plus nine this is 28 is what it rolled total  sam 28 is what it rolled total  matt it rolled a 19 on the dice  sam /none/ oh fuck even if i rolled a ten i couldnt do anything i rolled a three  matt okay so as youre singing this its jaw comes down on you slamming sound bites down  painfully onto scanlan for thats the wrong dice  taliesin this could go worse  marisha shut up taliesin  matt 19 points of piercing damage and i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  sam im great at those dexterity saving throw yeah yeah yeah sure sure thats a five  matt those of you who are watching you /dung/ see as the mouth impact sound chomps down on scanlan  and as it pulls away scanlan is nowhere in sight having been swallowed by the purple worm  taliesin oh shit  matt you are blinded and restrained and yeah you just see darkness and you feel the muscles  constricting as youre forced down its throat as your feet splash into what seems to be some sort  of highly acidic liquid that resides in the inside of its body  sam tell me this dungeon master earlier when i had done my eyebite thing i had my /none/ cone up here  when he grabbed me was the cone still close to my mouth  matt sure well say that however i do need you to make a concentration check because of the  damage you sustained on this  sam okay concentration check concentration ive never rolled for concentration oh wait  matt i know im trying to keep up on that more now  sam i have advantage on spell concentration  matt because of your feat that you took  sam well that wasnt good either so one was a five and one was a /none/ ten do i add anything to that  matt all right so its a constitution saving throw and half the damage you took so youre  trying to beat a nine  sam constitution so 12  matt so 12 so yes you succeed so you currently even though youre constrained youre  still maintaining your eyebite spell against the purple worm  sam okay  matt all right so that ends the worms turn scanlan it is now your turn  sam great i dont want be in here anymore  matt correct  sam can i look around /dung/ its dark it seems cozy seems nicer than outside right now actually i  dip my finger in the acid ooo  matt sizzling sound not fun not fun  sam its not good so im going to make him barf me up  marisha oh thats right it was sick right  matt its sickened currently by the spell effect you put yeah  sam im going to cast at level five thunderwave with my hand cone of clarity up in my  grill im going to explode him from the inside  matt all right thunderwave so at /none/ fifth level that would be an additional 4d8 that is 6d8  thunder damage  travis holy shit  sam wheres the d8s  matt it makes a constitution saving throw  travis hes inside come on armageddon this motherfucker  matt that is a 16 on the saving throw  sam 19 is my save  matt so 6d8  sam whats that ive already lost count 15 plus seven whatever that is  matt 22 points of  sam wait 6d8 yeah okay  matt okay it impact sound booms from the inside and you can see a /none/ central part of the worm  muffled boom billow out like a cartoon as this bit of smoke emanates from its mouth just the  sheer force of it forces you a little ways up its throat but not enough to jettison yourself out of  its body its muscles are too strong and you feel like you need to do a little more damage to it  from the inside to be able to escape  sam okay but it did hurt it yes  matt it hurt it yeah it took some damage and at this point as /none/ well you grunt feel  your body being pulled inward and crushed by the muscles percy youre up mr mistform  taliesin okay these creatures have no eyes  matt correct  taliesin im made of smoke  matt affirmative sound  taliesin sighs okay  travis yes well established  taliesin as long as were all clear here whats going on thats fine and i can just dash  matt thats all you can do or begin to try and revert which will take ten rounds  taliesin well and can i still move around and do things while /none/ im trying to revert or is it  reverting am i just stuck reverting  matt you know thats a good question  taliesin can i just make the decision  matt i think you can still move around you just think you have to have concentration towards it  ill have to  taliesin im going to have my concentration on reverting but in the meantime im going to  matt you can use your action to begin to revert your form yeah  taliesin i have to use my action  matt however nope reverting takes a minute /none/ during which time a creature is incapacitated and  cant move  taliesin sputtering  matt so yeah so currently  marisha yeah hes really married to this one  matt it took me ten seconds to read it  liam so to get out of this form we have to stop and like meditate in one position for a full  minute what does it dissipate without doing that how long does it take  matt eight hours  liam eight hours good  marisha wait what no no no one oh no yeah youre right  sam cant /none/ you just kill it wait a second hold on a second  marisha yeah can i not kill it at all i cant kill it  matt not if youre in wind form no  marisha question can i switch to an animal form  matt you cannot take any other action aside from dash or reverting when in this form  taliesin can i dash into one of the creatures  marisha why would you do that  matt i mean you could try to you would surround it with smoke  laura youre made of wind  taliesin /none/ it wouldnt know that i was there it wouldnt  travis you could either dispel it or you could flee  taliesin okay well i had the thought of maybe i could attempt to get them to attack each other  matt i mean that can be attempted how are you going to do that no you cant talk in this form  what are you trying to do  taliesin im attempting to tap them to get them to think that theres something happening where  the worms are to get them to attack  sam like a three /none/ stooges thing  matt okay so you swirl this way as a dash and attempt to make an impact ill say go ahead and  make a strength check  taliesin really  matt yes with disadvantage and a serious penalty because youre mist go for it  taliesin natural 20 motherfucker  matt okay roll again because its with disadvantage  taliesin screams  laughter  liam here comes the one  taliesin baby i know weve been arguing a lot lately but i want you to know i take it all back  i take it all back /none/ im going to buy you something so nice im going to buy you ice cream im going  to buy you good ice cream im going to go to scoops three motherfucker  laughter  taliesin which brings me to four  matt all right as the coldish mist of percy batters itself helplessly and ineffective against  the body of the giant frost worm creature seeming to no effect as its now keeping itself attentive  on what is nearby and within its range of motion  taliesin i will use an action surge and start turning back into /none/ a normal human then  matt well you can continue to use your movement you only moved a short bit  taliesin oh im going to move behind it then that way no i mean far away from it and then  im going to use an action surge and start meditating on it  matt okay it does attempt to take an attack of opportunity as it just feels you rush by nah it  misses rolled a two  taliesin thats what it feels like motherfucker  matt all right so that end your turn  taliesin yeah /none/ that ended it  matt all right vex youre up  laura cool  sam vex you and me babe all we got to do is last ten rounds of course all you hear is  muffled cries  laura i know ive got to save you  taliesin trinkets there too  laura i know  matt oh i get to make the save to see if the eyebite maintains itself that would be a no it  rolled a ten and its minus two on its wisdom save so it still has disadvantage on its attacks  laura /none/ okay all right are there any stalactites coming from the ceiling  matt there are actually theres a number of them just in this general vicinity theres a  whole mess of them up above from just the natural formation of it  laura okay im going to shoot conjure barrage at the ceiling and try to create noise away from us  matt whereabouts  laura how about towards the ceiling above the frost worm  matt over there okay all right so okay the frost worm is in the way to hit that angle so you  may /none/ have to move to do so  laura which way could i shoot that he would not be in the way  matt you have to probably move this way to get around him just to hit him at this angle just  because its such a large entity  laura huh god i dont know i mean  matt what you got  laura im going to move as quietly as i can around towards that little crevice  matt go ahead and make a general dexterity check  laura just add my dexterity to it 17  matt /none/ 17 okay as you move past stepping as gingerly as you can you can see it slap it moves  its face in the direction of where youre going but you just manage to move beyond where it  thought you were and it misses you as you move by so now you have visual on it  laura okay now i want to shoot conjure barrage at the ceiling above the frost one  matt okay conjure barrage up here go ahead and roll damage  laura okay that is 3d8 i guess 14 plus five whats 14 plus /none/ five 19  matt 19 damage all right and with that you release a blasting torrent of arrows at the  ceiling in this giant cone blast it strikes into the ceiling through the force of the magical bow  that youre holding you can see a number of rocks in bits and pieces begin to chip off and a few  small stalactites crack and plummet downward i need a dex save from grog and keyleth  marisha dex save  matt dex save  liam we still take damage in this form right  matt you do you /none/ just take half damage from nonmagical sources  marisha regular dexterity save or do we get advantage because were misty  matt you have resistance to nonmagical weapons  marisha do we have advantage  matt no you take half damage because youre misty  marisha i dont think i made my dexterity check  matt what did you roll  marisha a two  travis i have advantage danger sense dexterity saving throws total of 20  matt there you go all right so that is a total of seven damage to keyleth halved to four because  youre /none/ in mist form seven damage to the frost worm  laura seven damage because of the stalactites  matt yep they fell on it four damage to you  laura im going to look over at trinket and im going to go  matt actually no damage to you because you completely dodged out of the way  laura im going to go like this to trinket and im going to shoot another arrow i cant do the  same thing im going to shoot an arrow at the ceiling right above the frost thing and then im  going /dung/ to use my bonus action to hide  matt okay  laura okay oh god that didnt do any well i was hitting a stalactite which is totally still  so it was 13  matt 13 because of your halfelf eyes able to see in this dark interior of the cavern id say  yes that hits barely  laura so just a regular d8 yep 11  matt 11 damage all right 11 damage it falls yeah it does not make its resistance to the fall so  the stalactite falls larger than the previous ones that were /none/ knocked out by the barrage that  loosened it up this one crumbles slamming into the head of the frost worm for three points of  bludgeoning damage all right  laura and then i stealth for 21 points of stealth  matt okay good to know all right ending your turn its now pike pike who currently is  confused by the circumstances that have currently happened she steps out shes not mist she steps out  laura why would you do that why would you do that youre going to kill her  travis she would know better /none/ than that  laura she would hide  liam she could be our saving grace let the man  sam shes the only one whos got arms and legs right now  matt keyleth left the alcove after saying stay still she saw a few individuals turn to mist on  the outside shes very worried and confused by the circumstances  laura im sorry i didnt shoot an arrow i just realized i didnt shoot an arrow at his worm and i  meant to and im sorry  sam what worm my worm  laura the one that /none/ youre in  sam you could have hit me its okay dont worry  matt pike comes around the corner guys whats happening and all she sees is you disappear into  the shadows on the side trinket being very quiet and mist swirling in the space around as these two  giant worms growls as parts of the cavern are collapsing into it  laura can i do that to her  matt she doesnt see you do it because youre hidden no she doesnt see you she doesnt roll  high enough perception right now she feels alone /none/ and doesnt understand what she can possibly do in  this she doesnt have any indication of what to do in the circumstance so she is going to  travis does pike have dispel magic  matt she does  sam she doesnt even know  matt she doesnt know whats happening shes going to cast flame strike 5thlevel spell its  a tenfoot radius shes going to blast this one right here which is the one she sees now closest  to her proximity and being icebased so thats 8d6 radiant damage  sam hey nice job pike  /none/ matt 32 points of fire damage does not make its save suddenly from the ground you see the rocks  shake and lift for a second before a beam of divine fire explosion comes bursting out of the  ground in a tenfoot radius around this worm however i do need a dexterity saving throw from  both grog and keyleth  travis okay  liam keep your head in the game  travis 18  marisha what shut up liam  liam get it get it girl get it  marisha 16  matt 16 so thats going to /none/ be 32 damage to that thats going to be 16 damage to you grog and 32  damage to you keyleth  marisha all right 32  matt fire and radiant damage as she just sees mist in the air around the frost worm and has no  indication of exactly what happened however the frost worm did take it as well thats going to  end her turn as she isnt quite sure what to do at that point that brings us to the top of the round grog  travis what do i i cant leave  laura /none/ just back away from it  travis ill just back up to the tunnel leading out of the yeah  matt okay  all right that brings us to  travis oh and id like to start to revert if i could  matt okay youll be there for a minute doing so you cant move any further you cant  move youre just sitting there focusing on incapacitated  travis no i dont start to revert  matt okay all right that completes your turn now we come to the frost worms turn the frost  worm first and /none/ foremost it gets its frost breath back it turns this way burrows underneath and  seeing all the movement to this side goes ahead and unleashes a secondary frost breath in this  direction that will only affect the purple worm and vax i need you guys to make constitution  saving throws  liam and i cant remember evasion has nothing to do with this  matt correct  liam okay im going to use luck my last luck thats not good so constitution save  matt correct  liam seven  matt seven nope purple worm also does /none/ not make it so thatll be to both of you  laura so obviously these worms dont even care about each other at all  matt no seemingly in this moment you see now there is not a kinship between them if anything  they both arrived due to feeling the same movement and one is currently now attacking whatever is  large and in the area that it doesnt recognise the center movement of  marisha does that mean we could just get them fighting each other  laura that is what im thinking we could get them to /none/ fight  matt 36 points of cold damage to you 36 points to the purple worm  sam that halved  matt no it is magical damage not blunt damage so you just take it especially as mist cold is  bad as mist all right so with that the purple  sam wait doesnt my worm take it too  matt he did both of them are still there  sam still alive  matt yeah looking a little rough but its still alive all right that ends its turn now its  keyleths turn  marisha okay heres /none/ my question  matt yep  travis probably no  marisha i know  laughter  sam can i juggle while im a mist  matt if you wanted to because it is your spell that you cast even though its technically not  concentration  marisha i will say we all failed in reading it also  sam dont do this dont do this  taliesin laughs cant win  laura its also what what does it say  marisha nothing  taliesin ill say it if it makes you feel better  liam why dont we let him /none/ say what he was going to say  matt what were you going to say  marisha nothing  matt no whats up  marisha im afraid now  taliesin as you should be youre defying god  sam what were you going to say matt  marisha yeah what were you going to say laughs i like that question  laura yeah right since you cast it you could break your concentration  matt im saying because you cast a spell that wasnt a concentration spell if it was a positive  effect which it technically is and you /dung/ did not want it you could cancel the spell id let you  do that if you wanted to what did i not read  marisha we all failed in reading it  taliesin casting time  matt one action  taliesin no  taliesin and marisha one minute  matt it says one action on my thing  marisha it says one action on yours it says one minute on mine  matt does it  marisha yes it does  matt thank you fight club five  marisha no its different it says casting time one minute  /none/ matt lets see what the players handbook says  taliesin consult the book  laura it doesnt matter it already happened  marisha it already happened so it doesnt matter  travis shouldnt there be an ad for gilmores glorious goods right about now  marisha yeah its already happened were already committed  matt in the players handbook wind walk is one minute youre right  marisha one minute so fight club failed  matt fight club five failed  sam this is a reverse ad for fight club five  matt or i have to update it either /none/ way no it might have been fixed since ive just got to update  it all right well anyway in a bit of druidic inspiration you manage to very quickly for the  first time  marisha i mean im still willing to commit to it its fine  matt being as an air ashari this is your realm of expertise and your first time using it you  were so excited that you managed to accelerate the casting of the spell regardless of the situation  it may have created so what do you want to do  marisha /none/ so i accelerated the casting of the spell  laura so you can cancel it if you feel like canceling it  sam if you want to  laura some peoples brothers in the room are at a really low health level right now i dont know  who were talking about but some peoples brothers  marisha are you giving me an out because you feel bad because if youre giving me an out  matt no because technically it shouldnt have happened because it was a oneminute casting  time there are many things in that spell that /none/ were not read by the caster so im giving you  the opportunity to correct the mistake if you wish not to take it you can  taliesin i read the card too i didnt see it  marisha he did read the card too and we all thought it was a good idea  matt this was a very hard and valuable lesson for casters  laura were in the middle of a battle  marisha laughing for my own shame all right fine ill drop the spell cause i feel really bad  about it but on my /none/ way down okay heres my question because i want to make these fuckers  fight each other so is there loose rock along the edge of the wall  laura i dropped stalactites on them so yeah theres lots of loose rock  matt yeah and theres rubble on the ground next to it from where the original cavein happened  marisha okay so as im dropping the spell  matt all of you who are mist form now revert and you fall about five to ten feet and catch  yourself on the ground no harm no foul  /none/ marisha as i revert back can i slide down that wall to create some  matt did you want to move first over here to do it  marisha yeah  matt so you shift over you drop the spell  marisha uhhuh i drop the spell and as i drop the spell i want to grab some wall and bring it  down to make a big vibration right in between these two motherfuckers  matt okay make a strength check  marisha oh jeez louise oh thats not too bad its not a saving throw  matt correct /none/ just a strength check add your strength modifier  marisha 18  matt 18 all right so as you slide down you grab onto some of the loose rock and rockslide  they come tumbling down as you slide down so you land here at the base of the two worms and rocks  tumble around you at the base of the cavein and you get the sensation that you may have made a  decent bit of racket right around your feet  marisha uhhuh do i have any movement  matt id say you have half your movement /none/  marisha oh jesus christ can i just tiptoe backwards towards percy or should i you know  what im going to stay im just going to stay right there is that even worse of a decision  matt i dont know what do you want to do  marisha im just going to up against the wall and not move  matt okay youre going to doctor grant this  marisha im going to doctor grant it  matt got it okay keyleth that ends your turn vax youre up you now have your physical form  again  /none/ liam okay i look around really fast run up to my sister give her a giant hug and magic sound  dimension door over to where grog is  sam you can dimension door i keep forgetting that  matt so as you rush over and grab onto her you both poof in a nightcrawleresque poof of  smoke as it settles you are both no longer there as whats the range on the dimension door  liam oh its so far its like 500 feet i believe ill find it  matt i believe it is dimension door yeah /none/ its fine 300 feet youre fine you guys appear over  by grog now  laura is that the edge of a cliff over on that side  matt it goes right to the edge right there and this is where it would go down the side of a  giant icy mountain you guys are at the very very top of a very cold cragulous part of the  cliffkeep mountains  laura got it  liam im hasted do i have one or two attacks at this point  matt you have one attack right now  liam /none/ one attack okay  matt you went up and did your action already  liam action okay well then im going to throw a dagger at the back of the frost one  matt okay whats the range on your dagger  liam its 60 feet sharpshooter no disadvantage  matt 60 feet just misses you go knife sound and it just tumbles scrapes across the ground  stops at the base of the worm and then vanishes all right that ends your turn now it is this  guys turn at the top of his turn scanlan you all /none/ right  sam im in a nice womb  matt you take  travis uhoh  taliesin all the damage  travis he grimaced still rolling  matt 23 points of acid damage as it begins to digest you from the inside  sam arent i immune to acid damage  matt are you  sam because of the feast  matt no poison  sam isnt that the same thing  matt no  laughter  matt all right so the  laura somebodys got something of acid resistance though somebody has an item  liam i had armor /none/ and i gave it to someone i dont have it anymore  matt as the frost worm and the purple worm are now clashing in this space they both turn  hearing the sound now the frost damage that had impacted the purple worm last turn lets see if  it nope its going to retaliate for that its going to attempt to make a bite attack against the  frost worm that is going to be a 12 that is going to miss however hearing the noise its  going to make a tail attack at the direction that /none/ keyleth is thats a natural one as it arcs  through it impact right next to your head and then pulls out of the rubble the rock to your  left is now cracked and broken with a giant hole where the stinger had placed itself  marisha i hold my breath  matt yeah disadvantage on those attacks from that eyebite is really bad so thats been very  helpful from scanlans point by the way scanlan make another concentration check because of the  sam concentration check  yeah yeah im okay 18 and 19  matt yeah /none/ youre fine okay that ends the purple worms turn its going to stay right  there actually no its going to burrow away as currently its made its attacks its going to  burrow into the ground and is currently not within anyones visual range  laura i have it hunters marked can i feel it  matt you can sense that its underneath the ground somewhere in this cavern  laura okay  matt that brings us to scanlan  sam its going down  matt its going through the ground you feel it moving around  taliesin shake /none/ it shake it shake it  sam so it has poison right its poisoned me oh it has acid  matt yeah its acid youre feeling yourself digest within its body  sam can i make an intelligence check to see if i know anything about these creatures  matt you can if youd like to from the inside of its body yeah go ahead  sam is that my action no its  matt no no no ill let you do it because youve been very close and personal with it  taliesin youve had a lot of time /none/ to think  sam specifically what im trying to remember from my encounters in the past is if it has any  resistance to poison damage  matt go for it  sam what am i doing intelligence  matt intelligence add your intelligence modifier  sam 16 16  matt 16 okay youve heard of these types of entities before youre uncertain whether or not  it has a resistance to poison per se you get the sensation probably based on the fact that it uses  poison you would think so but nothing else about its body seems /none/ to be poisonrelated or of the  essence of poison  sam but it does use poison  matt as part of its tail the stinger you saw it use earlier does seem to have some  sam oh gotcha okay so it probably does have poison resistance okay  matt you dont know but you do know also that if you were able to probably do enough damage from  the inside it would probably throw you back up you also get the sense that since youre currently  underground now would be a bad time to do that /none/  sam well im in a tunnel right  matt as far as you know yeah  laura there could be other worms around  sam he disappeared down well i dont know anything okay all right i can feel him moving  so i dont know where i am anymore so i dont want to dimension door out because i dont know  where id end up so instead i will cast stinking cloud inside no no no no no no cancel  belay that order shit because i think hes immune to poison so im not going to /none/ do that im  going to fuck theres nothing i can do  laura can you take a healing potion in case he starts to digest you some more  sam strained im like this right now i cant do anything  laura can you go like that and get a healing potion and mumbled go like that  sam i am my left foot yeah i cant reach a wand i dont want to get rid of  matt you could dimension door in theory  sam but i dont know where id end up  matt as part /none/ of the spell you can either visualize a place you can see or one you can  describe by stating distance and direction so youve already been inside the room you know what  it looks like so if you think youre somewhat close by  sam so even if ive moved since i saw it last i can still dimension door to where i think  matt in theory yeah  sam okay then i will do that i will do that  matt okay where do you want to appear within the room  sam i want to /none/ appear where vex was before  matt okay so you  laura no i was further over  matt he didnt see that last thing he saw was you were right next to him before he got eaten so  you disappear from the inside of its stomach and appear in a puff of smoke  sam goo goo all over me ew oh and then i see ive seen the other worm before right  matt briefly before you were swallowed yes  sam and i get my bearings and i can see pike i can see trinket  /none/ marisha you also see me against a wall right next to you  sam so i will shake it off i will inspire keyleth and say singing i only want to see you  slicing up that purple worm  all singing purple worm purple worm  sam ooh okay thats good  matt d10 inspiration die to you keyleth  marisha i love that song  matt ends your turn scanlan percy youre up you just caught yourself on the ground on the far  end by the tunnel  taliesin i want to hold my turn until the /none/ other worm returns  matt hold your action you mean so you want to move anywhere or are you going to stay where you are  taliesin not going to move anywhere just going to stay right there  matt all right cool that ends percys turn as hes holding his action until it returns vex  youre up  laura im going to shoot from my blazing bowstring at the icy worm  matt thats your second and final use this day  laura yeah i know 17  matt 17 unfortunately misses your flaming arrow streaks off the /dung/ darkness of the cavern and just  passes it before it slams against the far cave wall  laura balls balls balls so im going to shoot nope not going to do that im going to  shoot a regular old arrow at him  matt do it hey those are still helpful  laura and it doesnt do anything it goes right past him and hits the wall and he looks towards  the wall  matt an arrow isnt a very hefty thing when its by itself hitting stonework it makes a noise you  can barely make /none/ out well see if its enough to distract it are you going to stay where you are  laura oh i could have used my inspiration i should have used it on the blazing bowstring one  sam hey man whatever  matt what are you going to do are you going to move do you want trinket to move are you going  to stay where you are  laura everybodys staying  matt okay gotcha all right pike now seeing everyone revert and seeing this kind of awkward  situation of these creatures moving about is going to /none/ yeah and she cant see you because youre  on the other side of the wall  laura can i use my bonus action to hide  matt sure  laura i do that  matt i would recommend moving to one side of the cavern or the other because right now youre  still out in the open its kind of hard to hide if you have nowhere to hide but you also  get the feeling that these creatures being visually hidden is not affecting it at all  laura doesnt matter then i dont do anything  /none/ matt all right so you stay still pike stands still figuring that it was helpful last time but  feeling bad for accidentally now seeing the mist reverting to her friends that she blasted them  on the previous round lets see she didnt realized in the moment that you guys turned into  mist while she was in the corner  travis its all right ive had worse  matt im pretty sure she has another 5thlevel spell and this would be the last of them shes  going to go ahead and flame strike again on the frost /none/ worm this time centering it around there  so the tenfoot radius only hits the worm and doesnt see any allies nearby so that will be  8d6 33 points of damage  laura go pike  matt natural 20 on the save though so it takes half the damage  laura damn you dick  matt 17 points to the frost worm all right pike casts that and then stays perfectly still in space  she still has some motion and some speech to it but her feet are planted firmly on the ground  hopefully thats enough and /none/ that finishes her turn back to the top grog  travis did you hold your action  taliesin i held my action  travis until when  taliesin until the other worm returns  travis ill do the same thing  matt okay the frost worm its now its turn it does not get its frost breath however  taliesin theres a rock slide to its right  matt it is there is a rock slide that keyleth is standing in thank you for the reminder  taliesin damn it sorry  marisha thanks for that  matt its going /none/ to turn around you can see now its tail emerges and its going to arc up and try  and bite and slam in your direction with both sides of its body at once this tail does not have a  stinger on it but it is still a giant bludgeoning implement first attack is going to be a 19 to hit  marisha yeah  matt next one is going to be a 16 to hit  marisha no  matt all right so the tail slams on the ground next to you estimating your position and failing  /none/ and just hitting the rocks that you had slid down however it does bite down with its open icy  jaws you take 17 points of piercing damage as well as an additional six points of cold damage  marisha bringing it to a total of 22  matt 22 yeah  taliesin sorry  marisha i deserved that  taliesin we live in a cold cold world no one deserves anything  matt lets see if it makes any sort of perception check okay cool that ends its turn its now  keyleths turn  marisha so does it /none/ know that im there since it just took a big chunk out of me  matt it senses that it impacted something and something that reacted and tasted like it had been  bitten so you get the sense that it knows  youre there  marisha all right im in arms length of it right  matt you are  marisha im going to reach out and cast blight on it  matt okay  taliesin you touch me when youre trying to touch the worm i dont know how  matt cast blight on taliesin all right constitution /none/ saving throw whats the dc on that  marisha 18  matt 18 it does not make it 16 so 8d8 necrotic damage to it  sam necrotic damage best kind  marisha oh jeez what was that seven seven plus five seven eight 13 16 and then another  12 where was i at 18 oh so 28 32 33 points  matt 33 points of necrotic damage to the frost worm as you reach out with your hand and grasp it you  can see now its icy white exterior all of a sudden shudders in place and /none/ you can see small cracks of  black veins begin to spring out from your hands into its body its frozen breath all of a sudden  thaws briefly into a dripping drool as it is stunned momentarily and it pulls away wrestling  itself from your grasp it did not enjoy that at all so thats your action  marisha im going to once again not move can i go ahead and cast healing word on myself  matt as a bonus action i dont see why not  marisha nine total that does help  matt that ends /none/ your turn keyleth vax youre up  liam all right i want to see if i can use the haste to do double distance to get behind pike in  that little alcove if i cant go that far ill use dash to get behind her  matt you could you can get behind her  liam without the dash  matt yeah because of your haste you can move 60 feet  liam im standing right behind her and i say pike im a little banged up dagger dagger dagger  matt okay go for it it is just /none/ or no its within 30 feet  liam 17 for the first 21 for the second  matt hits hits  liam 18 for the third  matt all three hit  laura is it sneak attack because keyleths standing right next to it  liam all right so first one is four this is doubled so thats 15 plus 16 21 25 28 36  for the first  matt all right  liam second one is nine and the third one is ten  taliesin damn  matt all right as your barrage of blades spinning noises go /dung/ spinning right over pikes  head she feels the actual wind distortion puff past her hair sending strands kind of wafting in  front of her face as she just stays perfectly still trusting you the blades all impacts  sinking into it one of which strikes an area of the side of its body armor where the plates on the  armor had seemed to be cracked from the blackened veins from her blight spell as it does the  dagger doesnt even stop and plunges directly into its body and you can see a gout of dark deep /none/ red  blood just spurt out from the wound it screeches shakes in place from the impact the  pain its starting to look a little harsh  liam done  matt all right ends your turn that brings us to the purple worm  laura singing purple worm  laura  marisha singing purple worm  matt purple worm is going to now emerge from the impact  marisha come on fight the big cocksucker  matt its going to burst out from the ground where you and pike are as the last motion that it  felt was /none/ you rushing over across the ground boom it comes tearing through making its bite  attack against you and its tail attack against you as well because of pike not moving  liam question  matt yes  liam pike probably doesnt but do i have any advantage being that im in this little closedin  bubble  matt technically no because it has reach and it just kinda swerves around the inside and it  knows this cavern pretty well as its been through here a few times so thats going to be a 23 to  hit on /none/ you  liam of course that hits  matt for the bite attack  sam even with its disadvantage  matt oh with the disadvantage sorry the second roll thank you for reminding me there it  would have been a 13 on the second one plus nine that would be 20  liam still hits uncanny dodge please to halve the damage  matt to halve the damage yeah you can do that on this one but first then theres the bite i  will do that now that is 21 points of piercing damage  liam unconscious  /none/ matt with it halved  liam 21 halved  matt 21 halved would put you at 11  liam oh yeah okay no im still on my feet  matt okay  liam dazed mumbling  matt the tail stingers going to swing at you with disadvantage that is 14 rolled a six and a  five so as the bite clamps down at you its tail tries to strike at you but misses entirely  however its jaws attempt to close around you i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  liam hold on /none/ 16  matt 16 as you try and move out of the way its not quite fast enough as darkness takes you the  mouth slam shut sound clamps around you gulp noise and you are swallowed  laura you didnt even get healed panicked gasp  liam still conscious  matt that ends its turn now having it appeared as this round has happened i would like both grog  and percy to  taliesin im going to shoot the purple thing with a violent shot  matt how many points into it  taliesin im going to drop /none/ all three points into violent shot  matt okay that adds plus six to your misfire so you have like a 46 chance of  misfiring on this shot  taliesin if i roll a six a six or lower it  matt well it adds plus two to your misfire per point spent  taliesin oh never mind then oh shit then never mind then im just going to take two points of  violent shot so thats  matt so that would bring it to a misfire of seven  taliesin yeah  matt okay so take your /none/ shot  marisha you misfire on a seven or lower  taliesin yep  marisha holy shit taliesin  matt but if he hits its two additional dice damage to it  marisha come on golden snitch  taliesin seven  matt you rolled a seven  taliesin i rolled a seven  matt as you rear back get ready to fire all of a sudden you pull the trigger and the way that  you had customized the barrel to blast additional black powder blows up in your face and the gun  actually bends out of the way /none/ and you feel the impact  taliesin wait i get to reroll something dont i where is it where is it aw do i get a  reroll  yeah one save reroll per  matt thats a saving throw reroll thats not an attack unfortunately yeah the weapon misfires  doesnt do damage to you but the blast does not take off you would have to repair the bad news to  use it again  taliesin okay im going to pull out my new gun and take two shots  matt okay so you drop bad news take /none/ two shots go for it  taliesin god damn it sighs  travis come on percy  taliesin

shot  just to get its attention to get one in the mouth  matt okay as you take one shot gunshot noise it blast the side of the wall its head turns  towards you seeing the sudden movement and as you do you aim up aiming for the back of its  head you fire this time the bullet strikes true right into the back of its throat you can see now  explosion noise the blowout which is a small hole in the back of its throat you /none/ can see the  cavern behind it and a little bit of light that is peeking through it groans and just impact  falls across the ground here the eyebite spell no longer effective but it is currently still  there holding the area  liam muffled im still in here  matt yep you feel it impact collapse on the ground and its not moving and the muscles go lax  around you  laura thats good so you can move a little bit  matt its now grogs turn  travis i cant go get him though cause /none/ the other dick lord is still on the map  liam muffled im in acid in here  travis i cant get to him ill run up to the dead earthworm and try and cut vax out of his  stupid stomach with craven edge  matt as you rush up leaping onto the body of the nowdeceased purple worm you bring the blade up  and begin carving through go ahead and ill say you manage to over the course of this round you  dont have to roll for it you just begin to tear through it with /none/ the blade repeatedly gashing it  open until eventually you can feel the blows from the outside  travis did i just help midwife vax out of this thing  matt just a moment i would like you to go ahead and make an attack roll with disadvantage  laura an attack  travis 20  liam hits  matt all right go ahead and roll damage  liam i mean im unconscious  marisha youre unconscious  laura well he will be once he takes his damage  travis 17  liam unconscious  matt 17 so as you /none/ strike through you feel yourself hit something else within the purple  worm and as the wound opens up you can see vaxs bleeding unconscious form slip out of the purple  worms body onto the ground of the icy cavern  travis ew  laura you just killed my brother  liam im unconscious  matt all right that ends your turn  travis it was only one it

matt 31 points of lightning damage to it all righty as you step to the side releasing the  bolt of lighting energy it blasts into the front of its face you can see one of its jaw mandibles  gets torn off from part of the impact you can see now the deep red blood begin to pool on the side  /none/ of its face and drip down as it looks over whipping its head in your direction  sam whimpers do i still

regain 70 hit points  laura whoa  travis its like pulp fiction with the adrenaline shot  matt clerics man you come to consciousness taking the deep breath the cold air from the  cavern that you inhale stings your lungs and you look over and pikes there before you eyes wide  goes from a serious frown and a worried furrowed brow to a big smile as /none/ you come back to  consciousness vax as she goes and hugs you  liam and i clap my hand here and i leave a big gory slimy smear right on the half of her face  thank you pike  matt so youre back up that finishes her round grog youre up  travis we are

high as i can and drive it  straight into the top of its cavity and just drag it down and open it up like a beautiful bouquet  matt as you see grog staple himself to the top of this nowstanding 2025 foot tall creature  he using his barbarian strength to leap up on the top sinking the blade into the back of its head /none/  immediately it rears back its whole back arching as it does so you just use the heft of your  weight grinning as you drive the blade down the entirety of its body as you grind down to the  surface you can see its armored back just pop open like a freshly cooked sausage just the  insides spill out onto the ground by the time grog reaches the ground you are coated in thick  thick crimson strangely enough even though the blood is liquid you feel almost like this  crystalline force like there are actually /none/ ice crystals within the blood stream itself from the  cold that emanates from its body  travis like icy hot  matt yes and as you land and hit the ground its body slaps forward barely missing keyleth as it  wet hits the ground almost like a shrimp that had its entire back torn open its just in two pieces  face down on the ground right there  marisha good work grog  travis i want more whos next  liam shh  laura calm down grog calm your tits grog  travis can i look in /none/ the blade and go that was good wasnt it  matt you did good my

lets get the body and well get out of here we have to search the  body as well  travis i run over to the gold i run around the worm and run to the gold and i yelling frenzied  rageloot this shit just hacking away at it  matt slapping the stone and pouring all the rest of the gold you can get your hands on inside this  sam ill assist grog grog open the bag singing bigbys hand will grab the gold  laughter  /town/ laura yes oh my gosh get so much gold  matt giant scoops into the bag of holding its just pouring off the sides of it onto the ground  and youre having to scoop it back up inside  marisha i take out like my little filet knife and i start going to town on the frost worm in front  of me trying to salvage anything that i can from him  matt okay  laura i call trinket and i tell him to get over by the teleportation circle  matt make a nature check real fast /none/  marisha my book i got my book  sam who me nature check  marisha its me i got my book which gives me advantage  liam im meeting trinket and im going to layslashnap on his back  marisha 29  laura and im going to run as fast as i can over to where i can see them hoarding the gold because  i want to see it  matt all right you get over there pretty quick  taliesin im going to check the frozen body  matt okay as keyleth checks you check the frozen /none/ body  taliesin is that the dead man  matt oh oh the frozen man okay keyleth you take a moment to cut through and theres the other  undamaged mandible the eye appears to be undamaged but those are all going to be very  careful timeintensive things to remove properly there isnt much that can really be pulled from  this other than that theres not a whole lot of material on  marisha can i vial any of the blood  matt you can bottle some of the blood yeah  marisha yeah i want to do /none/ that  matt okay so you bottle some of the blood  marisha and im going to take that mandible if i can  matt okay so you remove a mandible so you can mark that down all right so you guys are  gathering money  travis we dont have anything to store it in really  laura can i try to get some of the icy armor off of the big worm thats right next to me now  matt you step up to it i mean most of the armor  laura i just want to pull /none/ on it and see if i can get some of it  matt the parts that you pull on that are like big hefty chunks that would be of any real use are  part of its body the few that are busted from the damage you dealt to it throughout the combat  theyre such small pieces and they crumble at your touch  laura its okay im more interested in gold anyway  taliesin is it possible to move the frozen man or is he just really stuck in there  matt you go ahead and you grab /none/ onto him and hes actually frozen to a coat of ice that is left in  there and looking at the ice pattern you get the sensation that that frost worm may have frozen him  in there had seen him previously and unable to reach him within the very back of that alcove  just frost breathed this one or another like it did so  taliesin keyleth can i borrow you over here  marisha yeah what do you want  sam are your hands dripping with blood right now  marisha yeah  taliesin can you warm /none/ him up and see if we can get him out of here  marisha yeah  matt okay so you begin to slowly  marisha we were trying to do this before we were trying to melt his face because pike was going to  do a talk to dead spell  matt okay  taliesin we know what happened to him now though  laura yeah weve got to get out of here  matt so anything else you want to do  marisha well i guess were taking the body ill focus my heat on his feet so /dung/ we can just  dislodge him and throw him over our shoulder and go  matt okay the ice slowly begins to melt you gather you probably have another five to ten  minutes before hell be free  travis thats pretty long too long  laura yeah if we feel anything lets go okay got the gold lets go lets go  matt youre still gathering gold its going to take you a while to get all this its a lot of  its a small opening  travis do we leave the cave or do we use the /none/ teleportation circle  laura teleportation circle  marisha how much time is it going to take them to get the gold  matt probably to get all of it another probably 15 minutes or so  laura jeez  matt because you have to like get in the cavern and pull out chunks so its a big hoard  marisha how about this lets spend five minutes doing all this stuff and see where were at  laura hes rolling hes rolling  marisha son of a bitch we should go  matt as youre having this conversation the ground /none/ begins to quake and you can just see  all go run run run  sam it could be an unrelated seismic event  laura scanlan run  matt all right as you all rush around the corpses heading towards the teleportation circle you  sam i smack myself with bigbys hand  matt giving yourself a lift as youre pushed along over the course you guys rush over to the  teleportation circle right as you hear the ground erupt about 30 feet behind you  laura oh shit  matt in a very similar fashion as the initial /none/ arrival of the worm and you hear a similar  shrieking sound  laura slowmotion turn around is it a purple one or a blue one  matt it is another purple worm a larger one immediate comparison you get the idea and as you  were tearing it apart both of these were adolescent they werent fully grown  taliesin run  travis must go faster must go faster  matt all of you guys rush onto it one after the other onto the teleportation sigil the sigil  carrying each of you back to your destination before the /none/ purple worm can reach you in time you  all now find yourselves standing in the room beneath the house that previously belonged to  krieg safe with as much gold as you could carry in the time period you had  laura which is a good amount i have a feeling  matt well come back to that in a minute but first were going to take a little break for the  restroom guys so well see you back here real fast well make this a quick break and see you soon  travis five minutes five minutes /none/ dont leave  matt bye guys  break  matt welcome back everyone so returning as the party calms down after the harrowing encounter  with a couple of wormbased entities what would you like to do  marisha sorry about that whole cloud mist thing you guys i was trying to  laura we almost died  marisha yeah sorry about that thanks vex  travis that was you  marisha look it was something new im still working out the kinks all right  laura dont do it again not in combat  marisha im working out the /none/ kinks im sorry itll be really cool next time i try it  liam 20 anything left or is it just where i we  matt same setup where you left it but the same pattern to escape that you recall from before  liam there were traps left still still the same all right  matt still the same pattern so you guys all thankfully due to vaxs viselike memory follow  the path through the tiles to avoid the traps that are set entering that room you make your way back  up the stairs to the gallery /none/ room that contained the tapestries the domino set the gold tea set  the skull with the gem all those things  taliesin i say we grab the tea set and the skull and take them to lady  laura dr dra  taliesin no actually maybe we should have it identified first  laura right that would be smart what are we going to get are we doing wait heres a  question i have do we have to give dr dra the portion of what we found down there because  technically its not in the house technically /none/ so whatever we find in the house is what we give  him a percentage of yes yes  sam technically hes not an honorable man but we should be  laura right and honorably it is truthful to say that we didnt find it in the house technically  its across the fucking world  travis thats true give him a bit of the tea set we give him the dominoes  laura they tried to steal our money scanlan and youre letting them have free rein in our house  right now  sam its their nature  /none/ marisha im still really confused as to why we came back here to begin with  sam we were checking it out to see if it was safe  marisha right well thats been confirmed its not  laura right we found the owner of the house and hes been frozen  sam should we report this to the officials and try to quarantine the house destroy it  something  taliesin i think that would be wise  marisha quarantine the house  sam just destroy the portal destroy the teleportation circle  taliesin certainly cant have anyone else /none/ moving in here  laura we should take it for ourselves just to keep it safe  sam take the gold or the house  travis and laura the house  laura we should let emperor uriel know that we should take control of this house because it  contains very powerful secrets  taliesin we should find out what that skull does  sam what does pike think about that  matt pike hearing this conversation and still glad that everyone survived this end of this whole  circumstance goes well  laughter  matt i mean we should /none/ let uriel know  taliesin i cant look at him  matt but we also made a deal and were people of our word  laura yes pike we made a deal for anything we found in the house  sam dont condescend to pike  laura im not condescending pike i am rationalizing this agreement  marisha im still really confused as to why we are trying to maintain honor to inhonorable  people  sam because were better than that  laura im going to tell him you said that  travis yeah why do we care if /none/ they have money  sam lets count our money first before we make that decision but im mainly concerned what pike  feels about taking control of this evil evil house  laura its not evil evil its not an evil house  sam its got an evil mysterious gemeye looking at us right now  laura well exactly its got secrets we have a house that has powerful secrets in it that people  shouldnt be in im saying we should claim it so that we can keep other people from falling  victim  sam all right if /none/ in claiming it we can get someone some sort of religious person in here to  clear it for us making sure that its pike would be an option  marisha how is this going to sound to uriel excuse me uriel just want to let you know that  we broke into general kriegs old house and found out its really dangerous can we have it  laura no we just say keyleth really  marisha well im just saying how do we phrase this  laura you think thats how you would phrase it youd say we heard /none/ rumor that the owner of the  house had gone missing we went to investigate and discovered very powerful dangerous secrets  within we know where he is hes frozen on the other side of a portal we need to make sure  nobody else falls victim to it so we close off the house and we say well keep it safe for the  time being  marisha and what happens when he asks why we were there in the first place  laura we tell him we heard that somebody went missing and we were investigating where he /none/ went  travis that makes sense to me  liam weve probably earned a bit of trust at this point  laura what we have to go through his guard no were part of the council  marisha i dont know  laura i think its a very fair percy  taliesin i would agree i dont think its necessary for us to claim ownership for it we  just need to have it cordoned off and make sure no one else other than us can come in  laura exactly im not saying its ours im saying we just /none/ make sure no else comes in  sam were leasing with an option to buy  travis is the skull with the gem in there still  matt its still turned away and i believe you put a tapestry over it  laura yes we did  taliesin lets bundle it up in the tapestry  liam that thing is trouble though that thing is trouble  taliesin well lets take it to somebody who  sam take the skull  taliesin i think we should take the skull and show it to someone who might know what it is /none/  travis all right i go over and grab the tapestry and the skull hold it like a knapsack  matt okay make no this is fine its relatively light  travis can you hear me  taliesin yes grog we can hear you  travis yeah right good maybe  sam oh shit the whispers if you havent read the comics check it out on geekandsundrycom  taliesin and while youre there spend some money at gilmores glorious goods gilmores where all  of your magical items can be procured with a smile a week  laura laughing that /none/ was the lamest slogan ever  marisha all of your items can be purchased  taliesin im exhausted  travis shut the fuck up wait wait wait last part last part last part  sam and dont forget  taliesin dont forget  sam if someones whispering in your ear its probably the sound of your conscience saying  go buy a tshirt  travis i take off running out of the house  matt as you guys are having this conversation grog just bolts out of the house just runs up the  stairs out through the foyer and /none/ is  laura and taliesin grog  liam i start running after him and im hasted  marisha oh its reverse whispering  taliesin its the reverse whisper  sam guys this is the rest of the show  taliesin theyre not talking theres just tongues in ears  laura laughs lalalala  marisha wet willie  liam im running out stealthing after him  laura i stop and i get the golden tea set and i take off after him  travis yelling

front yard at this point in time in the slightly dead grass  taliesin its going to go poltergeist on us isnt it  marisha the house just collapses  matt /none/ the suns still high in the sky late afternoon at this point  laura what the fuck was that about  travis the house and the skull are linked as long as the house stands his evil will grow  sam whose evil  travis it didnt say the house has to be taken down to the ground the portal must be destroyed  liam says who whos in there  travis loud and angry i just heard this fucking calmer hesitating i have  premonitions at times it runs in my

dangerous magics are drawn to imagery /none/ like this  let us see what this is about first  marisha pike can you discern what kind of entity this might be attached to  matt i had a feeling before and she pulls out her healing symbol and casts detect good or evil  again in the direction of the skull you can see she recoils the moment that she concentrates the  aura is definitely evil from this object  marisha okay  laura maybe it was lying to you  sam what  travis lying i hadnt thought of that  marisha is that all /none/ you have pike thats all you can find out  matt you have to take it to somebody who knows it or spend some time with it perhaps  laura how about this how about nobody ask the skull any more questions  marisha yeah no one touch the is it just laying on the floor right now  matt just laying right there off to the side  sam put it in the bag of holding  laura and marisha no  laura i dont like evil things in the bag of holding we have lots of weird things /none/ in there

put a cloth over it  sam yeah that might look a little weird  taliesin its going to look weird with a cloth over it but please go ahead  matt okay vex as you approach it and go to throw the cloth over it you get a brief /none/ view of  the gem thats in the socket and where there was a slight shimmer to its surface when it was  looking to before you can now see briefly what looks like some sort of a ghostly face appears  across the surface for a second and then fades  laura oh shit  matt you throw it over it  laura that things alive that is definitely alive  travis what the skull  laura no no no

go  laura oh just one of us though  sam yes you  laura can you transport items with it  taliesin as long as theyre on you as long as youre holding them  marisha but percy to be /none/ fair youve had a bit of a weakness with you know evil entities being  attached to you  travis yeah besides if it grants a wish i get the fucking wish  laura you get the wish grog you sure get the wish  marisha no its not going to its not granting anyones wish  sam we could send pike with it  marisha i mean if want to sleep a day we can all just bamf back we can tree stride back to  whitestone if we want to take a

yeah but then itll be in whitestone  sam well leave the skull in this house  taliesin thats a very fair point were not leaving i dont think thats a good idea  laura no  marisha what hang on grog you

wanted to get out of the house  sam its like a genie  travis dont look at me im just the translator  sam oh this is weird we need some help on this  marisha why was it talking through you grog why not pike  taliesin i think well get answers from allura  marisha if you /none/ can ask it questions maybe we could ask it a few more questions  travis im okay with that  sam no it will hypnotize us and corrupt us  travis its in a knapsack  laura i think we should hide it and then open it up when were in front of allura  taliesin thats fair  marisha what time is it  matt right now its midafternoon two three oclock in the afternoon  taliesin lets let uriel know whats happened  sam well go on a quick pub crawl  taliesin ive got to get home /none/ and work on a few things anyway ive got a broken gun  marisha i guess ill go with percy and take the skull and ill make sure we put it somewhere safe  in the keep if you guys want to go talk to uriel  laura pike grog what do you guys want to do  travis what do we want to do pike  matt i dont know we wanted to go talk to uriel  marisha do you want to come with us pike do you want to be with the skull pike or do you /none/ want to  go talk to

 taliesin well count it back when were  laura away from your friends but back at the keep  sam all right fair enough  matt okay so as you guys make your way back to greyskull keep with the skull

doors the throne room is  currently closed and there is heavy guard up and upon you approaching im sorry do you have  business with uriel  laura not at the moment  matt all right  laura but we will once you tell him that were here  matt all right hold on he steps inside the doors close about two minutes pass the guard  /none/ comes back out im terribly sorry uriel currently is in a very heated discussion and  cannot take guests at the moment would you like me to relay a message  sam yes  laura yes but we would like to write it down first  sam actually while you were gone and i cast friends on him while you were gone other guards  came by and said we were clear to go in  matt you can go ahead and make a deception check with advantage  sam natural 20  matt he goes other guards uriel himself /none/ just told me i cant let anyone inside  laura oh they must have seen him right after you saw him  matt all right fine and he opens the door you guys walk in and there you see the entirety  of the rest of the council of taldorei you see tofur brotorus you see seeker asum you see  what the hell is his name the other guy arbiter brom theyre all gathered in this discussion  uriel looks up immediately and says im sorry were not taking any  laura we heard there was a council meeting /none/  matt technically no but yes what is your business  laura were here because theres a council thing  sam were here to report a security concern of the utmost importance and urgency to you  matt theres a long internalized sigh not out of frustration just more out of being lost in  thought and a little sad he goes all right very well  laura is everything all right uriel  matt everythings fine what would you like to bring to the council  sam are we among friends here and free to talk in front of /none/ everyone  matt he looks around these are my trusted advisors and my trusted palace guard yes  sam weve been alerted to some evil afoot in your kingdom yet again the former kriegs homestead  has been vacant for a while and apparently has a portal to an evil realm inside we went to  investigate acting on a tip from  laura an old friend  sam yes  laura and discovered that it was in fact true the owner that was missing has been killed  matt so kriegs estate which was sold off after his disappearance /none/ over a year ago youre  telling me contains some sort of evil portal  laura yes  matt was this built by the new owner  laura no i believe it was built by krieg  matt built by krieg how are you certain of this  sam our informant told us as much we dont want to give his name  laura it seems rather old this portal  matt where is krieg now  laura i have no idea  matt all right well well send a security force to keep a very close eye on the /none/ house while  it is investigated  sam its extremely magically dangerous they should not set foot inside the place at all  laura incredibly dangerous it might be best if we investigate it ourselves  matt all right if youd like i was going to wait until allura returned and i was going to  assign her to it but if you feel confident then i will leave the investigation in your hands  laura thank you  sam will you notify us when she returns  matt i will  sam is there anything else  laura no /none/ you all look quite lovely today and we will leave you to your business  matt asum chuckles a little bit the rest of them acknowledge tofor gives a nod and uriel closes  his eyes for a second and rubs his temple and goes i appreciate the information if you  please we have matters to discuss  sam just real quick before we leave im sorry i think i had a burrito can i just use a facility  inside a restroom or something  matt certainly  sam thank you  laura ill wait for him  /none/ sam just wait out of earshot  laura far away  matt thank you they wait as you guys leave the chambers the guards close the doors and youre  welcome to go there are a number of various wcs water closets throughout the palace  laura they closed the doors  sam they closed the doors  matt theyre not going to let you crap in the middle of the throne room  laura no but i thought i could wait in the back of the throne room out of earshot  matt the guards are pushing you out /none/ of the throne room this is a very private meeting  laura excuse me handsy im leaving  matt sorry miss orders of uriel they push you out and close the doors  sam ive been in the throne room before  matt you have been yes  sam do you have eyes on them  laura no they fucking shut me out  sam all right give me ten minutes  liam do you need a scroll

the doors the front doors  sam of the throne room  matt how are you getting into the throne room  sam the doors are closed yes  matt yes  sam is there any gap at all  matt there is a slight gap on the bottom  sam okay im going to crawl in there  matt as you come by one of the guards swings at you you dodge out of /none/ the way without issue and  make your way underneath the doors and raise your flight pattern  laura i start chatting up the guards on the outside of the door to distract them a little bit  matt okay go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  sam dexterity oh no someones got a fly swatter ten  matt okay as you cruise in for a moment you can see the throne room itself in its round pattern  has designs carved into the walls almost like celtic knots there are a number of these designs  right /none/ towards the sides of each entrance that previously just looked like a design but they  emit a dull glow for a second and a burst of arcane energy comes out from them you find your  form immediately unfurl into that of scanlan the gnome which then plops back onto the ground your  polymorph spell dispelled all of a sudden the talk stops and the entire council turns back  towards the entrance as youre catching yourself on the ground  liam surprise  sam that ones full the one that i tried to go into its full /none/ and it needs a big cleaning  matt good to know scanlan  sam i thought there was another one this way  matt there isnt scanlan  sam not through there or anything all right carry on then you should send someone up to  service it though right away  matt he looks over to tofor and tofor goes  sam its a matter of security  matt well have it done thank you scanlan now please  sam okay two lefts and a right and im out thank you  liam matts got to be using botox /none/ because he didnt move  laughter  matt yeah you gather due to recent events that the magical defenses have been reinstated with  the current circumstances the doors open again and vex as you turn you see scanlan being led  out of the doors  laura scanlan what are you doing here  sam shat all over my plans lets go home i guess  matt all right you guys make your way back to greyskull keep vax is there waiting  liam no im not  matt oh you didnt go back to the keep  liam /none/ nope  laura i tell some guards on the way out just to block off that house and not let anybody in it  dont go inside on your life  matt noted the order just came through dont worry were gathering a troop specifically for  this dont worry  laura not a lot of troops just a couple of dudes is good  matt very well  laura okay  matt as youre leaving you can see there are a few armed individuals four approximately that  are moving towards the house to stand guard and inspect the /none/ exterior at the very least you  return to greyskull keep you guys get there as well grog you return on your own essentially  at this point unless youre walking with them with the skull vax is nowhere to be found you do  find that dr dranzel that whole team is gone except for zed  sam the drummer  matt yes zed is currently having a little bit of ale in the dining room area along with jarett  who was assigned to watch over while theyre at the keep as you step inside they all notice /tavern/  jarett still with his crossbow loaded in his lap though hes happy and jovial and conversational  with zed ah youve returned good to see all of you in good health the rest have left into the city  sam did they say why for a performance  matt zed leans forward and goes actually it appears that kaylie got in some sort of a serious  bar tussle last night and is currently being held in the stocks the stockade i get those words  confused stockade he takes a sip of his ale the rest of the /none/ troupes going to see if they can  get her out  sam all right good to know thanks zed  laura jarett  matt yes  laura any issues while we were gone  matt no issues actually they were good conversationalists they were very aware of my  disposition and i kept a very close eye on any movement preventing them from leaving the room  unless they were as a group except for their exit in which zed escorted me there have been no  problems  laura good man i pat him on the shoulder  /none/ travis shes in the stockade only problem is getting caught i like her style should we get  her out  sam id like to very much but i dont know how we cant just barge in there and break someone out  of jail were known people  laura dont you have your sheriff badge  liam laughs wellremembered  travis yeah cant we post a bond or something  sam its customs not sheriff  laura call the council  marisha well it sounds like theyve already theyre sending other people to get her out  whats the /none/ big deal  sam yeah but they could make the problem worse  laura those guys theyll make it worse  sam shes quite special to me i think we should i think i should go and try to get her out  marisha oh shes quite special to you yeah  travis theres one place i havent done it and its in a prison  sam not not in that way  laughter  sam thats creepy no not in that way  marisha why is that creepy  sam im not interested in her in that way  /none/ marisha but you were courting her two days ago  sam things have changed  marisha i thought she spent the night in your room  sam shes a good person and she deserves much better than the likes

right ive defined most of my life by the people  ive slept with and now this a new part of me that i have to figure out  laura well technically its still /none/ defined by  taliesin i was just thinking that its a redefinition  laura you could make a really good move of it by helping her get out of the stockade  sam i would like to but ill need some help probably i dont know if we can all go barge in there  laura trinket  matt bear grunts  laura scanlan needs help  matt trinket lumbers over to you and slurp licks the side of your face bear groan leans  into you nearly pushing you off your feet from the sheer mass  sam laughs /none/ thanks vex trinket im okay for right now but maybe you can help best by staying  here and looking after the drummer here and making sure  matt growls just

marisha oh wait pike will you hook us up  matt yeah and she goes over and  taliesin im going to try and do a quick repair to my gun also  matt okay go for it she throws down a couple of cure light wounds shes going to do 3rd level to  each of you /none/  marisha dope  matt of cure wounds thisll be 3d8 plus five to each of you so 23 to you and 21 to you scanlan  shell do a third one to you keyleth because youre looking pretty rough right keyleth  marisha huh  matt youre looking pretty rough  marisha im at 65 now with that so im still 30 under  matt so on top of that you get another 13 pikes going to stay with you guys  laura oh okay  matt all right so while you guys count the gold and what you /none/ managed to gather you find in the  laura out of sight of zed just so you know  matt not a worry you manage to pull from the hoard entirely out of gold silver copper  platinum the equivalent of 4150 gold pieces  travis wow  liam there was another 20 or 30g there  laura i know right  liam probably  sam we can go back  marisha how much 4000  matt 4150 gold  travis you dont want to go back in there  matt about 1050 gold worth of gems  laura 1050 /none/  matt yep in gems mark that and about 750 gold approximately of art items knick knacks things  that you would have to find a specific seller to really get the money for them  laura singing knick knacks  sam tchotchkes  matt yeah like small jade statues bits of jewelry  laura and how much in platinum  matt well the gold equivalent of platinum is what it would be the total amount is 4000 but  nice try all right so you guys make your way after asking around a bit you figure the closest  /town/ stockade is the promenade stockade  sam oh theres multiple stockades  matt there are but thats the one thats closest to the keep and the first place you should start  so you make your way towards the promenade stockade its a fairly grimlooking grey stone  building on the outskirts of abdars promenade which is a very very bombastic colorful  gathering of tents and buildings and various shopkeeps as you walk to the outside of it  approaching you can see immediately there on the steps is most of dr dranzels troupe just  sitting on the /none/ outside steps with two guards at the door and theyre all talking amongst  themselves waiting outside dr dranzel is not amongst them as you begin to step closer  sam he got nabbed too didnt he  matt laughs as you step closer you can see they wave you down and they recognize you and  approach you with an excited look on their face as if they now have some sort of backup  marisha im going to whisper to scanlan im going to say im going to stay back you go  ahead  sam all right /tavern/ thanks  matt so kent plucker approaches you as you approach and goes like scanlan good thing  youre here i think we may need your silvered tongue to go ahead and help us out in this  endeavor dr dranzels inside hes been arguing with the warden for quite some time were trying  to get kaylie out  sam what happened why is she in jail  matt she got in a bit of a bar fight last night it seems messed up quite a few gentlemen and all  of them are arrested and being held inside /none/ theyre wanting a bit of change to do the damages  and pay for the fine of whatever else shes done and well were not keen on really paying fines  so were trying to see how much we can get out of this with our  sam whats the fine  matt i dont know we didnt go in as a full group the guards wouldnt let us  sam was she injured in any way  matt i havent seen her youll have to go inside to find out  sam all right thank you you wont be /none/ needed here anymore you guys can leave  matt they all look at each other if its fine by you were going to wait for dr dranzel  sam oh yes all right percy  taliesin yes  sam what do you think our play is here  taliesin well  sam should we go in and pay should we do a bit of a ruse you still have your hat of disguise right  taliesin yes but i think im more useful as myself rather than anybody else  sam well you could be a guard taking me in /none/ there  taliesin i think on a certain level youre possibly making this more complicated than it  needs to be  sam yeah but its fun though no no youre right we should just go in and talk  taliesin you forget you have clout part of the point of clout is that you spend it you spend  your clout  sam oh all right  taliesin i know youre not used to actually having the means by which to just simply get what  you want by asking for it but you could just ask for it /none/  marisha that was the most privileged thing youve ever said  taliesin thats the most privileged thing  ive ever said that youve heard  laughter  marisha touché  liam marisha has a high clout score  sam so you think just walk on in there no subterfuge no sneakysneaky no breaking down doors  taliesin well a little subterfuge let me  marisha ive got polymorph i can always be a tiny thing in your pocket  sam who said that  marisha sorry im back here i figured percy and i were waiting back here  /none/ sam oh okay hi  taliesin let me attempt to see if i can defuse this relatively easily i will need some gold  sam are you lying to me to get me to pay you for a new gun  taliesin no but thats a very good point so later i will be asking for some gold to help me  fix my new gun  sam all right ill give you what you need  taliesin all right  marisha do you have gold scanlan  sam i do  taliesin okay we may have to have a /none/ discussion at the very least im going to need 20 gold at  the very least  sam 20  taliesin 20 gold at the very least  sam you dont have 20 gold  taliesin oh i do just not for your daughter  sam oh jesus  laughter  sam take 50  taliesin that will do  matt so you guys approach  marisha no trips to coldstone with percy you are not the godfather  taliesin i will take you to white castle though  matt you come to the front steps of the stockade there /none/ are two guards there with tower shields and  what looks like halberds to each of them one of them steps forward putting his shield out not in  an aggressive way but definitely in an attentiongathering way do you have business here  in the stockade  taliesin i do i wish to speak to the warden  matt the warden is indisposed in conversation at the moment  taliesin well he will agree to be indisposed in conversation with me im percival fredrickstein  von musel klossowski de rolo iii and im here on the business of whitestone /none/  sam hes an ambassador  matt make a persuasion roll ill say with advantage due to the very very intense  believable stare of scanlan backing you up  taliesin 19  matt he gives a nod all right but good luck the two guards open the doors and as they do you  can already hear raised voices shouting back and forth cant really make out the words but as you  step into the inside you can see there is a clerks desk with a clerk sitting there  keeping one ear closed as hes trying to /none/ write in a book to the immediate right of them there is  dr dranzel in an argument with a gentleman with a wellkept mustache thick over the top lip  slicked black hair that curls up in the back in a small poof hes wearing a breastplate and is  standing with an appearance of selfimportance at which point as you approach dr dranzel turns  and goes oh good someone with actual  taliesin shush who is this person  matt everyone gets quiet and the individual standing there goes well apparently hes the  man whos bothering /none/ me hm  taliesin what do you do sir  sam i just throw dranzel a quick little wink  taliesin what do you do sir  matt im a performer slight chuckle  taliesin excellent hes a performer you may leave we have no need of you  laura whispered oh shit  matt hmph he adjusts his hat and  taliesin guard escort the commoner out of the room  matt the guards instinctively step up and take his arms and they lead him out dr dranzel taken  aback and the whole time hes looking at scanlan /none/ with this look of like  sam you heard the ambassador please leave  laughter  matt boom the doors close behind the individual steps forward  taliesin now that thats been taken care of who is an authority that i may speak to  matt that im afraid would be me sly chuckle pleasure to meet you im warden cyrus  hume what is your name  taliesin cyrus hume im percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii of whitestone  matt this does me no service  taliesin it will  matt hmph  taliesin i am /none/ of course the newly appointed ambassador from whitestone and i have been  brought down here because apparently you are holding one of my performers a performer who is  meant to be heading towards whitestone in the next three weeks to perform for my sister  matt describe your performer sir  taliesin oh small plain female dismissive sigh  matt sighs heavily i know of the one you speak the same one were arguing i assume this other  individual that just left is one of your performers as well  taliesin yes he is he is one /none/ of the official performers theyre supposed to be performing at  the new coronation of a brand new temple in whitestone much has been arranged much has been  paid for and i dont want to explain any of this to the royal court  matt make a deception check  taliesin casting no not yet 13  matt okay he goes  taliesin if you were to be agreeable to helping us move this along i would remember the favor  whitestone would remember the favor  matt good well listen there are fines for damages or she sits /none/ until tried now  taliesin damages  matt the damages to the nervous brook pub are estimated to be upwards of 450 gold pieces and  the fine for drunken battery and disturbing the peace amounts to 250 gold pieces 700 total and i  would gladly let you take that rabid duggrubber off of my hands  sam youll watch what you say about her  matt oh will i  taliesin shush performer well sir i appreciate your candor i appreciate the cut of  your jib and i appreciate that you are a man of honor and /tavern/ of your station it is very very rare  to find someone who respects such things obviously the damages must be paid  matt if you wish to discuss it with the three in question he points to one of the cells on the  other side of the room and you can see that there is a set of bars and you can vaguely see what  looks like the shape of a person whos just slumped in the cell mostly cast in shadow  taliesin who are they  matt bar patrons and theyre all worse for wear /tavern/  taliesin do we know what happened  matt the dog has teeth three against one if the stories say true the bar patrons and the  owner of the establishment all verified that she indeed started and finished it  taliesin i dont care who started or finished it obviously we will pay for the damages out of your  troupes pocket  sam your majesty are you sure you dont want to write a check from the treasury  taliesin quite  sam ive got the checkbook with me we could just write a check  taliesin we /none/ will write a check for our friends pocket but for the damages i feel that some  responsibility must be taken  matt im not familiar with this check you speak of i deal in gold as does emon what good does  this do me in my station if i am to show up with a simple piece of paper  taliesin he has a very fair point  sam whispers your brand of subterfuge is not what i had in mind  laughter  taliesin what good is subterfuge when theres such an opportunity to create a ballad /none/ some sort  of ballad about a cautionary tale  sam i could have picked anyone to be with me here not this youre rubbing my face in it  because i threw your gun in the lava  taliesin you chose so poorly you chose so poorly it is truly impressive how poorly you chose  matt stop wasting my time if youre going to retrieve this invalid do so quickly  taliesin you may come pick up your gold from castle greyskull in the morning it will be  waiting for you of course sir in the meantime /none/ here is 20 gold for your trouble on top of the  gold you will be expecting for all fines imposed  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin highpitched one  matt he rolled a natural 20  taliesin all right bring it bring it  matt well i appreciate your attempt to maneuver around my station of which you hold so clear  you seemingly attempt to bribe a warden of the stockade in an attempt to retrieve what appears to  be a relatively how do i put it immoral destitute and feral creature  sam warden /none/ this is just like this bastard he always goes around trying to boss people around  and throw his money around and i turn and i punch percy in the face  matt okay roll for an attack  sam oh shit going for another one a nine probably not  matt plus your strength modifier  sam i dont have any strength one so thats ten  matt ten percy do you take it  taliesin yes i take it  matt okay whack a solid hit across the face you have to lean into it and make it /none/ look more  impactful than it really is  taliesin overly dramatic oh  sam and then i turn around and i punch a guard  laura oh my god  taliesin where are you going with this  matt roll another attack  sam 13  matt 13 you whirl around and one of the guards is rushing forward to try and break this up and  as you swing towards him your fist collides with the side of his helmet it definitely shakes him  for a second it doesnt do much in the way of damage but /none/ it does kind of hurt your knuckles a  little bit now the guards like startled sound and stumbles back a bit  sam ive just had enough with all of you people we performers demand respect and deserve it as well  matt the wardens now stepped forward and put his hand on the side of his blade and says am i to  understand you walked in here and immediately struck a guard of the stockade  sam ive just had it up to here with being bossed around by people like him  matt well would it /none/ make you feel better if hes thrown in prison  sam it would  taliesin it would make me feel better if he was thrown in prison  matt oh dont worry youll both be going  marisha about this time i come over the earpiece and i go hows it going in there guys  sam great  taliesin great everythings fine  laughter  marisha good just let me know if you need me  matt he looks to the side and two guards now one of the ones that punched you and another one to  the /none/ side both step up and are reaching  taliesin wont it be unfortunate when you find out i have diplomatic immunity  sam diplomatic immunity  matt you both have been manhandled and brought your hands behind you feel manacles being pulled  forth and the wardens just looking down upon both of you  taliesin i blame you for this  sam you should blame me for this im sorry i just had a really shitty day all right he  doesnt deserve this let him go just take me  matt very well now and you feel the /none/ release as the manacles come away you are escorted out of  the room you are put in shackles brought and thrown into the same jail cell as kaylie  taliesin all right how much to get both of them out  matt as youre being pushed out  taliesin yeah ill bring it  matt theres no answer at the moment the doors close behind you and youre thrust off of four  steps make an acrobatics check  marisha they were tossing your ass out  taliesin 23  matt all right you manage to catch yourself with /none/ a small tumble over the shoulder land willy  wonkastyle well stuck as youre thrown you hit the ground you can see off in the corner of the  cell kaylie arms crossed sitting on the ground she leans forward a little bit and you can see  the light hits the side of her face and she has a bit of a welt there and a bit of a black eye but  she doesnt look too worse for wear  taliesin now for the love of god just wait until nightfall and dimension door out of there  /tavern/ sam did i hear that  matt yeah youd hear that  sam good idea thanks percy for your help  taliesin youre welcome wait until nightfall  sam huh oh all right  matt as she leans forward she goes huh like father like daughter aye  sam you could say so i heard you had quite a night last night at the bar  matt hm felt good i like breaking faces  sam apparently youre very good at it i saw i got a glimpse of your victims over there  matt laughs they had it coming /none/ dont know why but i had a feeling somewhere in their life  they probably deserved it most men do  sam yep youre right about that stay away from all men forever  matt they were fuckwits their faces were so punchable  sam i know that feeling listen ive come to get you out of here  matt laughs apparently youve not done that very well  sam dont worry ive still got some tricks up my sleeve just wanted to make sure youre all right  did they hurt you in any way  matt only one /none/ persons really hurt me recently  liam cold as ice  matt look scanlan father i spent a lifetime hating you id imagined the moment we would  finally meet for so long planned it out in my head had it all worked out my idea of you what  youd be like what youd say and you know what up until last night i was pretty spoton i dont  know what i wanted i have a lot to process to think about but id prefer not to do it in this  dank cell so if you have /tavern/ a way out please nows the time to do it  sam you think now all right is anyone watching  matt there are two guards that are not watching directly but theyre muscled up against the bars  and keeping an eye over the shoulder  sam ill need a distraction do you think you can come up with one  matt her eyes turn for a second and she goes chuckles i think that can be done she leans  up to the side of the bar and peeks her head out for a second closes her mouth /town/ cups it with her  hand and you start hearing from the opposite side of the room through arcane ventriloquism these  three different male voices going ill fuck you up you hear punches and you hear all of this  screaming and chaos at which point the two guards look over one of them gives the other a  motion and they both run off to see the other side of the room she looks back at you  sam youll have to teach me that trick and then i dimension door us out onto the street  matt /town/ as you reach for her she still pulls away a little bit but you still grab hold and poof  puff of smoke you guys magic sound appear outside landing a couple of feet above the ground  and catch yourselves youre off to the side of the stockade where it meets with one of the nearby  walls no one seems to immediately notice you other than a couple of people that are walking  down the street that see two individuals appear out of the ether and land onto the ground  sam all right lets get out /none/ of here percy i didnt wait quite until nightfall  taliesin i assumed you wouldnt were already walking back  sam all right well catch up  matt you guys head back towards greyskull all right  marisha im glad i came in handy for that field trip  sam oh shit burn it down burn the stockades down  liam id also like to point out that grogs single nutflick did more damage than your two  fullon punches  laughter  matt this is true all right eventually you guys make your way back as you do you /town/ gather  and about five minutes behind you the rest of dr dranzels troupe arrives looking a little bit  frazzled and a little confused he steps forward to the rest of you and goes i dont know what  you did but theres a manhunt for two gnomes right now over by the promenade but good on you  might want to lay low for a little bit  sam good thinking  taliesin the troupe may want to get out of town for a bit as well  matt i think thats the plan we were going to /none/ stay a few more days we had a couple of gigs  lined up but i think weve pressed our luck far enough so all right everyone feeling  spectacular he claps his hands and the rest of the troupe start grabbing their goods and their  instruments and what little cases and bags they do kaylie runs off real fast and comes back with  her one overtheshoulder satchel that carries all of her worldly belongings then let us be off  he gives a little tip of the hat to scanlan with a nod looks to the rest /none/ of you we greatly  appreciate your hospitality were sorry for any confusion misunderstandings and general  debauchery good night to you all he turns around and they all start walking out kaylie  begins stepping and she stops and looks over her shoulder towards you scanlan and says dont  come looking for me when im ready ill come find you she turns back around and leaves  sam oh shit  marisha i liked them they were fun  travis did you tell her youre her dad yet  sam thats not she figured it out grog  /none/ travis thats awkward  sam yes yes it is  laura they forgot to grab their gold i like them  matt that they did actually  marisha maybe they thought we were even  liam probably should check the silverware though in the keep  laura oh i run and check the silverware  taliesin i check to make sure the skull is still there  matt the kitchen is cleaned out  laura no  matt all of the silverware  laura what about jarett he was supposed to be keeping an eye on them  marisha yeah /none/ what the fuck whats with jarett  matt jarett was one man keeping track of multiple people with one very small quick child that you  were the only one able to keep an eye on  laura i hate your friends  marisha they were good drinking buddies  sam theyre all right theyve got their good qualities too  travis just the silverwares missing  laura what about our rooms is it just the kitchen thats cleaned out or did they take  everything in the keep  matt oh no no no none of the rooms have /none/ been touched except for the guest room where some of  them were staying  laura there was shit in there anyway  matt yeah there wasnt much in there but a couple of candlesticks things that were just  decor anything that could possibly be hocked for a little bit of change from those rooms is gone  laura they dont know i shopped for everything at home goods so jokes on them  matt you gather probably no more than two to three hundred gold worth of materials were taken  in total that includes fine cookware that /none/ includes decor that includes a couple of previous  art pieces that you had collected  taliesin please tell me they stole the giant painting  sam its not here yet  taliesin damn it  matt it hasnt been delivered yet thats probably in transit  taliesin no  liam and where would it have been hidden on their person  taliesin they could have rolled it up and stuck it where the sun dont shine  marisha a 20 by six foot canvas  taliesin some caverns run deep  sam im going to check my bed just /none/ to see if theres any shit on it  matt you go and inspect pretty extensively it does not appear that anyone has left you a scanlan  surprise  marisha percy and i go downstairs to make sure the skull is still there  matt skull is still in the workshop yes  marisha beautiful  matt what do you guys want to do right now  taliesin im going to spend some time working on the special barrel and see if i can get that up  and running  marisha what time is it  matt at /none/ this point its closing towards dusk  laura we should heal up and get ready to take this to whitestone in the morning yes  marisha i guess so  taliesin 18  matt 18 all right you disassemble elements of the pistol you get the feeling that the way its  weighted to attach the hand mortar to the pistol its still going to continue to be a very unwieldy  thing you are probably best to design them as separate pieces unfortunately the way the  pistols balanced for aim and such the mechanism thats required to lob /none/ an object for the mortar to  be able to do any help with is going to throw off your ability to aim much with the pistol going  forward not to mention increase the misfire score by crazy amounts but you could create them both  separately and swap out as needed  taliesin all right  matt all right you guys spend the evening you rest up youre back to full health youre good  to go as the morning comes around  travis i have a question  matt yes  travis can i wait until everyone /none/ goes to bed and can i make my way into percys workshop  taliesin its locked  matt as you get to the workshop you check the door and it is indeed locked  marisha we stashed it  travis whats the door made of  matt its made of solid metal it was constructed per specifications to be able to withstand  concussive blasts in case of accident from the inside  travis can i try to pick the lock  matt you have no lockpicks  travis can i shove an axe in the lock hole  matt /none/ you can  sam clang  matt make a strength check  travis i have a greatsword thats just a normal greatsword  laura are you going to try to shove it in the lock  travis yeah like a credit card in the side of the thing like a crowbar that was crap  matt what did you roll  travis ten  matt ten in trying to wedge the sword into the side of the door you eventually feel a shift as  you push you feel it gives way and you look and withdraw the greatsword which /none/ is now bent at an  angle to the side yeah that swords not going to be functional in combat any further  travis all right i go to bed  matt okay  taliesin nothing good ever happens to you in my workshop its just not a good place for you too  many things  matt all right so morning comes around you guys come back rested as you each individually  come to consciousness and finding your way down the first thing youre met by is a very perturbed  laina who as soon as you come /none/ down says im terribly sorry i went to make breakfast and  theres nothing to make breakfast with i dont know what happened  laura its okay scanlan is going to buy all new stuff for our kitchens  sam im supposed to lay low though  laura oh thats okay you can give her all the gold that she needs to buy new things for the  kitchen  sam i have only  laura you have about a thousand gold because i gave it to you  sam i gave 50 to percy which you didnt use  /none/ matt to buy basic cooking supplies it wouldnt be more than 30 gold to restock the entire  kitchen it was more other elements of the keep  sam including the silverware  matt yeah  sam oh great  laura it wasnt fancy silverware it was utilitarian  matt it was decent it was functional it was included with the keep  sam all right heres 50 go get us a decent set of silverware  laura and other things or send somebody else if youd rather  matt im not much help around here right now am i /none/ all right and she runs off returning a short  time later with groceries as well that she found while she was out makes a fresh meal for  all of you partway through breakfast there is a knock at the edge of the dining hall and you see  cordell your halforc guardian there has his big heavy crossbow at his side sorry to bother  you while youre eating you have a messenger who wishes to speak to you at the front gate  laura ill go  matt all right follow me  sam vax never came /none/ home last night  matt did you come home no vax has not showed up yet  sam should we be worried  taliesin were going to have to collect him before we go  matt as you go to the gate its opened up and you can see there standing by himself seeker  asum hood back bald halfling helm with his tattoos greeting you he goes hello vex  laura hi  matt ive come to request your presence at the precepts stage within the cloudtop district near  dusk all of vox machina this evening if you /none/ dont mind  laura oh well why  matt uriel and i have been in extensive discussion these past few days and the reveal of  riskels betrayal has had a profound effect on uriel and rumors have been spreading amongst the  district and the higher order of the city uriel is to make a statement regarding it and to prevent  any political intrigue will talk to the politically inclined populace first as members of  the council we would like for you to be there to help us based on the reaction if you would be so /none/ kind  laura yes of course ill tell the rest of the group we were planning on heading out to  whitestone today but we can put that off if its very important  matt its rather important  laura all right what were you guys fighting about before can you tell me  matt its nothing you need to worry about  laura really it looked kind of serious  matt i think tonights discussion will absolve any questions you have  laura is anybody in trouble  matt no youre fine youve done nothing  laura can i /none/ insight check him  sam we should torture him to find out  taliesin im going to shoot off a limb  laura 23  matt 23 he seems fairly forthright and honest there is a sense of urgency to him hes really  insisting you guys be there  laura okay well we will be then  matt wondrous i will notify the rest of the council i look forward to seeing you this evening  laura yes if you see my brother anywhere can you send him home  matt yeah ill keep an eye out i have /none/ a network in the city i can probably locate him  within the hour if need be  laura thank you  matt no worries he walks away as he steps away you look for a second you glance away and  look back and hes gone  laura he is so sneaky i need to train with him more  taliesin like batman  laura i go back and tell everybody what he just told me  sam oh my god  laura right  laughter  taliesin i suppose well have to put it off for a day /none/ then  sam yes is the skull going to be safe here while were gone  taliesin i think so  sam can it see inside our keep can it channel some beast  taliesin its locked very far away right now in a very secure room  sam but not secure magically  marisha yeah percy maybe me and you should make some reinforcements or something  liam its just radioactive material in the basement its fine  sam what if its a portal what if it can send a dragon to us or a worm or something  /none/ travis it did say as long as that house stands it will be very powerful  taliesin well do you think it would be safer somewhere do you think theres something you  could conjure perhaps around it or should we move it to another room  laura i feel like your room is very secure  taliesin we could always send it straight away to whitestone but  marisha but wed have to put it with someone else right  taliesin wed have to let someone take it to whitestone it could be there today or we could  /none/ keep it in my room or we could move it perhaps into the temple of sarenrae  laura maybe how many times can you use that little tree thing keyleth  marisha once a day  laura fuck  marisha i know or else i would totally run it over and run it back  taliesin oh but you can run it over and run back  marisha oh if i use your thing  sam if you if you go there take the stone from his sister and you can come right back  laura yeah take the stone /none/ from his sister and come back  marisha i could  laura let her know its useless after the one use  sam well lets not lie to percys sister laughs  travis is it safe in whitestone i mean the temple of sarenrae is at least here  laura got a good idea what if you go you dont take the skull you tell allura whats going on  bring her back with you through the tree  sam we keep summoning allura to solve our magical problems we brought her to whitestone and now  were bringing her /none/ back  laura shes really really smart  sam all right  laura she can go right back you can send her right back  marisha what if she doesnt come  laura well then you come back  marisha id be using a 6thlevel spell

last night  marisha nothing happened last night but it seems like a ticking time bomb  taliesin im going down i have to go get my things anyway so im going /none/ to go down everything  seems fine doesnt it  matt untampered room seems left as it was  laura it doesnt seem tampered with at all the door  taliesin the door is steel reinforced lined and bolted to the wall its not going anywhere this  room is designed to explode  marisha i mean i could all right  laura maybe we should make sure theres like fabric over it  taliesin its hidden in the room  travis maybe we should go in and check on it  marisha i could wall of stone another kind /town/ of box around it  taliesin i go into the room i shut the door behind me i check my hiding place  matt untouched  taliesin and its untouched and perfectly reasonable i return it to my hiding place which  if i have to reveal it later i will happily tell you where its hidden shut and lock the door  behind me everythings fine  travis thats a relief  taliesin lets find your brother  marisha all right i guess were staying in town  sam were leaving the skull  marisha seems okay  sam /none/ laughing lets at least post jarett here  marisha

it from my money  taliesin i throw ten gold at him right now just in lieu of i /dung/ throw ten gold  matt very generous of you percival  taliesin its the very least  matt and he sets up his chair in the far corner staring at the door again and sets his crossbow  over his shoulder and just sits waiting  taliesin lets go find your brother  matt now vax what are you up to  liam i mean im assuming i

matt /none/ as you guys spend a good portion of the morning scouting about the usual paths that you  take as a group knowing the back alleys and the various paths that you walk through emon to ensure  that you avoid the main thoroughfares and the mostused walkways as youre glancing about you  see a quick shadow shift past about the size of the individual you are seeking  taliesin puffs air sorry  matt you look over and you see vax dart off around the corner and dodge down an alleyway  marisha vax vax  matt you /none/ faintly hear keyleths voice behind you  liam not now kiki and i just keep going  laura did you find him  marisha nope  laura vax  matt you guys spend the better part of the day searching for him asking questions nobody has an  idea a few individuals try and squeeze some gold out of you you eventually manage to gather they  have no idea what theyre talking about by about early afternoon two oclock in the afternoon you  eventually make your way back to the keep figuring that hell find his way back /none/ if he  doesnt want to be found upon arrival the guards also havent seen him but once you go up to your  room to get into more comfortable attire your brother is sitting inside your room waiting  laura well there you are whats going on  liam look everythings fine all right  laura i believe you fully  liam everythings fine i just dont know what were

/none/ doing we were just trying to survive  laura right thats really all were doing now just on a grander scale  liam sighs were running into this shit on purpose now which is all right when theres  reason i dont always know why were doing the things we do it was fun breaking into that  house im good at it  laura yes you are  liam i dont know why we did it i dont know why im working with a large

and i love these people but i dont know why were doing it and i just want you to  think about a little bit too and i walk out the door  laura i get ready for the evening  matt okay as the sun draws across the sky pushing towards dusk as the light blue begins to  turn to a somewhat purplishorange hue you all gather your /none/ materials whatever attire you wish to  bring and make your way towards the cloudtop district anyone wish to do anything else  liam im going through my vast array of cloaks  laughter  liam and im taking the other one and putting of all my many two cloaks im going to put

arm  liam hes currently like this  matt yeah hes like lifted  sam its the wizard of oz  matt yeah you skip along the rest of you make your way to the cloudtop and you make your way  around the stage and its against the wall near one of the entrances to the cloudtop but on the  interior and /town/ you can see there is a rather large stage up against the wall there is already a  crowd gathered you see merchants highborn families political guests upperstation  military a number of welldressed representatives from all over emon have gathered for this you  guys meet up with the rest of the group and you kind of you know gravitate gilmore gives  everyone a quick wave and gives you a respectful nod aha yes and he wanders off and starts  mingling with some of the other guests just as the sun vanishes beneath the distant horizon a /town/  procession of palace guards approach the area the crowd parting as uriel arrives with the escort  flanked by his family and the current inner council of taldorei with arbiter brom seeker  asum tofor brotorus allura is absent of course for being in whitestone they all step onto the  stage along with the guards as well as cheers and light applause begins to break out not crazy go  wild but just like muted hooray  marisha rich people clapping sure  matt yeah you know  matt guards have already set up a few chairs on /none/ the stage uriel begins to sit on  one as his family gathers behind it and he puts his hand out and motions to everybody to go ahead  and hush down as he does he stands up from his chair friends and family allies of this fair  city of emon housesinarms to the taldorei family guests guardians and lawkeepers alike i  thank you for coming on such short notice now it has not escaped me that talk spreads quickly  within these walls and rumors only seek to undermine trust it is true lord riskel daxio  /none/ honored member of our council and overseer of development within emon for many years has  unfortunately passed away we mourn our friend and ask you all to respect his legacy enough to  not to smear his name that being said this was just one of many hardships that has befallen our  council and my family this past year many that have left me with a terrible burden weve been  faced with deceit and i failed to see it weve been beset with allies in need and i have been  noncommittal in aiding them weve been /none/ clouded by demonic powers and ive failed to protect my  family and my responsibility to all of you i look back at my bloodline at my father and his  father before him and i plainly see what i am not these times are different this wonderful  city has grown these past centuries into something grand a beacon of civilization here in these  lands that my ancestors gave name to my family has built us up and i feel that there is little  more my family can accomplish for the greatness of these lands it has /none/ outgrown our meager guidance  i did not choose to be your sovereign it was by blood that i came into this and i did my very  very best to live up to your expectations i can see the future of you all and i wish to safeguard  it by leaving it not in one hand but the hands of many as of the end of this week i will be  stepping down as your sovereign the taldorei bloodline will no longer hold the fate of this  realm we will instead leave the council to rule /town/ and he looks about at the other council members  on out to you out to the rest of the group there will be a chosen few exemplary members of  our society who will step up and aid in this task and join the council as well you the  peoples of emon will be the ones to guide us to a new age of prosperity at this point now the  claps come in again and some cheers happen theres a little bit of confusion in the crowd  but for the most part everyone seems to be /none/ into it at this moment one of the guards hurries up  the side of the stage and you notice whispers something into asums ear who leans over and  gives a nod and worried expression vex  laura giggles yay  sam radio dj voice dont forget to subscribe to geek and sundry so you can see archives of  the show and many others i dont even know  laura wait  travis its hard right when one ears in and one ears out its tough i was trying to plug it  sam remember liam doesnt really /none/ hate travis in real life  laughter  laura wait wait as soon as i notice that i touch grog and vaxs shoulders  and i point up really fast  matt you look up and you guys all gather this as well you can see piercing out of some of the  cloud cover above what looks to be two fastmoving streaks of color black and red they  just whoosh and then you cant see them any more  laura could i tell from my favored enemyness that it was dragons  matt you can make a hefty /none/ perception check if you like to see exactly how much detail you can make out  travis can i look up too  matt no im giving her this because of her really high perception  laura no that was wrong 23  matt 23 its hard to make out details from this distance theyre moving quick  laura one black and one red  matt uriel now goes i am beyond confident that all doubts in the capabilities of those i leave  the city to and more and its at this point you start hearing bells going off /town/ around the city  tops of walls in the distance you recognize these these are warning bells at which point the  crowd starts murmuring and getting nervous and uriel puts his hand out please please i  laura can i use my primeval awareness to see if its actually dragons close by  matt okay you begin to concentrate on that for the moment asum now steps up and says everyone  if i might ask you to all quickly make your way to your respective homes there is a small emergency  we must attend to at this /none/ point you guys hear this whoosh sound and you turn around just in  time to see what looks to be a large larger than youve seen before white dragon just slam into the  side of alluras tower in the distance claws clunk into the side digging into the stonework  wings unfurled it looks into the upper window of where her actual parlor is and peeks in for a  second before just unleashing a blast of icy cold magical breath into the inside of the tower you  can see now screams start tearing around you as /none/ the guards start getting their weapons ready at  which point the dragon pulls its head back and looks about at everyone screaming and pushes off  the tower as it does you see the stonework crack and the top of alluras tower shatter  laura oh my god  matt  and then begin to collapse smashing into the city streets around you at which point the  dragon wingbeats and takes off again above you at this point in time utter chaos has been  unleashed and you can see now the guards are rushing uriel off the /none/ table you guys are there  caught amongst this chaos at this very moment as the white dragon heads deeper into the city you  hear a loud impact that silences the chaotic air around you as the wall that the stage is  buttressed up against now has perched above it an enormous vision of death a grinning ancient green  dragon its wings are curled around its form as it looks down at the rest of you in the middle of  this open space and goes delicious cattle raishan enjoys the taste of fear  laura and /none/ marisha raishan  matt at which point it leaps down onto the stage crushing part of it i would like you all to roll initiative  marisha no what  sam we cant fight four dragons can we  marisha wait did you say four he didnt say four  laura and sam theres a red and a black a white and a green  travis are the red and black dragons  laura they were red and black of course they were fucking dragons  travis youre sure  laura everything else was dragons why

you are familiar with dragons as one of your enemies only the most ancient /none/ and  powerful of dragons ever reach this size chromatic dragons are very selfish entities and do  not usually work with individuals of other color patterns the fact that this is this coordinated  between multiple is a very very bad sign youre suddenly brought back to a singular moment in your  past when you recall seeing four orbs embedded in a wall  laura yeah no i think we we brought this on ourselves  liam chickens come home to roost  matt so grog damage on the one strike  travis just on the one oh /town/ yeah right im sorry i was so caught up in the fact that im just  literally going up against death incarnate hey  marisha we had no fucking reason to go into that basement  travis 19  matt 19 okay 19 damage good to know all right that ends your turn first it is raishan  raishan roars as you can see now this burbling cloud of greenish black fume just spills  out of its open jaws outward towards the crowd  laura jesus  matt all right  sam jesus crit  matt i need grog /none/ vex pike and vax and percy to all make a constitution saving throw  marisha am i in there as well  sam i was in there as

flesh begin to burn and curl  laura 20 didnt save  matt nope the rest of the crowd around you screams out in horrible pain as the rest of them  gasp and fall to the ground  marisha /town/ holy fuck he just took out the entire council  travis if i had resistance to poison damage because of the belt of dwarvenkind is that halved  matt you take that halved yes you take only 33  travis oh fuck me im like i cant remember i cant remember what im trying to do we got to go  matt actually before your turn is over the dragon whoosh repositions itself for the rest of  the crowd over there you get an attack of opportunity against it if you want  travis oh hey awesome thats a /town/ 19  matt 19 that does not hit you go to strike its already out of the way and you find yourself  even amongst your rage shaken by this as you look around for the first time and realize that the  crowds of people that were around you are now face down unmoving on the ground amongst the open  space as it steps across the wood as it lands ruining the last bit of stage and landing on the  opposite side keyleth its your turn  marisha are there any trees nearby  travis wouldnt mind /none/ turning into that mist right now  marisha no shit i didnt learn it go ahead  matt there is a tree theres a tree about 100 feet in that direction  marisha 100 feet  laura or go inside  marisha all right everyones around me more or less  matt yeah  marisha i slam my staff on the ground and i cast antilife shell and i say shouts everyone in  the shell were running  matt okay how big is the radius of the shell  marisha its not that big its ten feet radius so /none/ you guys are going to have to get close to me  marisha ten feet  liam thats enough for all of us  marisha thats enough for all of us if we gather  matt thats your radius there  sam im right there already  matt all right  marisha pike and scanlan are in it everyone else needs to get close  matt yep all right and youre going to stay there wait for everyone to gather to you or are  you just going to run and everyone else has to catch up which if everyone /none/ else makes a dash  movement they could probably get to you next round  travis yeah just go  marisha all right yeah ill do like 20 feet not my full 30 but enough to where people no  fuck it ill do 30 feet  matt okay so youre 30 feet up to the edge there all right that ends your turn vax  liam i click my boots and i shit where is everybody  laura running towards keyleth  liam i yank trinket by the fur on his butt and say come on trinket and then /none/ start running  backwards and grabbing at my sisters cloak as i go towards keyleth  matt okay with the boots of haste you get up within this area pretty easy trinket turns and  sees you run and looks over towards you which its your next turn  laura okay i dont know why were not running inside instead of away are we running  marisha were running to the tree so we can transport via plants was the thought  laura got it okay im going to shout out in draconic and im going to say raishan is /none/ that  his name  matt raishan is what it seemed to refer to itself as  laura raishan  marisha you got it you got it  laura so sorry for whatever pissed you off so bad  sam all right you had it  laura your fights with us not with this city leave the townspeople alone and i take off  matt okay i imagine you tell trinket to do the same  laura yeah yeah of course  matt so you rush up trinket comes and gathers off to the side there  marisha hes going /none/ to kill us yeah  laura oh oh can i cast something  matt well say you are now there for those who want to see there technically there off to the side  laura can i cast something  matt to get over there would take both it would take a dash action so no unless its a bonus  action then you couldve like hunters mark if you want to do something like that  laura i guess ill do hunters mark on him i was going to do protection from poison so i might not  full /none/ dash  matt yeah well say up to you  marisha is that a radius thing or just for yourself  matt what do you want to do hunters mark  laura ill hunters mark ill just dash im just stupid  liam matt probably too late but can i retcon say im holding my attack since i didnt do  anything fine if not i just thought  matt with the haste you couldve gotten there id say sure so well let you have it all right  holding your attack for what  liam if it bears down /none/ on us  matt okay scanlan  sam me im going to  laura gasps what about gilmore where is he he was right next to us  matt i know  travis just keep its not about gilmore right now its scanlans turn  sam where is he  matt you can make a perception check  sam 12  matt 12 you dont see gilmore anywhere you look about the bodies you know the color of his robe  but you dont see it anywhere on the ground in the chaos you really have no idea where he /none/ is  sam okay i will sings bigbys hand shamone i will bigbys hand and put it right in front of  him and wow its so tiny compared to him  laughter  sam i will use it as a interposing hand blocking him from approaching us and i will use my  movement to climb into the circle of good  matt okay you can get there okay that ends your turn  sam and ill shit  matt want to inspire somebody  sam i guess i mean whos near him just grog right  matt right /none/ now its grog percy and pike are all still out right now  sam theyll get away right theyre going to run youre going to run right theyll be fine all  right ill inspire grog by saying youre a magnificent handsome bastard dont die  matt all right you take a d10 inspiration die  travis thank you  matt pike is going to rush right here and is going to attempt to cast mass cure wounds mass  cure wounds as a 6thlevel spell so thats 4d8 plus five six creatures in a 30 foot radius so  /none/ thatll be all of you shes not going to do it to herself or she cant do it to grog so she  can get  sam grog did you get hit  matt she can get everyone but trinket but trinket seems fine so that is seven eight 12  15 plus five 20 points healed to all of you guys  sam great thatll help  matt except for grog thats going to be her turn and she just moves into the circle there  with the rest of her movement that brings us to percy  taliesin /none/ im going to look for gilmore  matt perception check  taliesin what  laura what happened to you percy  taliesin i dont know nine  matt in this chaos you have no idea where he is unfortunately  taliesin im going to hold my attack for if the dragon comes towards us and im going to run into the  matt you rush in all right at the end of your turn all the rest of these guys just go running  running as far away as possible getting up going at full sprint all over the guards /none/ are trying to  usher people out of the way you have crying mothers who cant find their kid  laura oh god  matt you have absolute chaos and at this point your hear in the distance a large explosion as  you see a rolling cloud of fire rise up in the distance over the mountain and the rest of regular  emon surrounding the cloudtop district this guy over heres going to run as well beginning of  that turn grog youre up  travis im booking ass  matt okay with a dash you get over /none/ to there  sam dont worry my magical hand is there laughs  matt raishan now is going to move over here  sam hey but i try to stop him  matt the hand is going to try to  sam got a strength of 26  marisha thats awesome  matt interposing hand just gives you cover against the target and it cant move the hands  space if its strength is four so its not going to move through the space its going to try and  move to the side so instead of going after you /town/ guys the hand just moves with it and keeps it in  between but it stays approximately here it then blows towards this crowd here just catching grog  in the corner so grog i need you to make another constitution save  sam with inspiration  matt with inspiration if youd like if you need it  travis mutters im okay 26  matt 26 you succeed so you take well say 33 points of poison damage halved to 17 all right  the rest of these guys except for oh no grog no grog no those guys all /town/ survive though  theyre coughing and trying to get away this brings us to end of his turn at this point in  time you look up and see whoosh whoosh another set of wings come slamming down onto this side  travis holy shit look at the size of that thing what the hell  sam laughing what is that thing  matt as it lands it looks down at the group and then runs up the side of a buildings rooftop up here  marisha oh jesus christ  laura so were totally getting in the tree i /none/ know it were going to make it  sam laughs the tree has been evaporated  matt so the rest of you guys are you all moving as a group forward  sam oh hells yes  matt okay you all go rushing you all go dashing forward at full speed aside from vax  who can get to the tree this turn the rest of you are going to get halfway there  marisha fuck  matt so well say for the purposes of this movement well move it backward  marisha theres not a closer bush nothing closer /none/ we can jump in  matt no not currently the closest large enough plant to use this ability  sam me and pike get there because i dimension door us  matt okay actually technically grog can get there too and vax and pike and scanlan you guys  all get there the rest of you are all inside the antilife shell as youre running  liam im not going to leave the group im going to pace with them  matt as youre pushing forward the large black dragon is just toying with you its climbing  across the /none/ rooftops and just watching you as you run and you hear it chuckling under its breath  menacing chuckle whoosh impact  taliesin okay is he taking to the air  matt he takes to the air and jumps to another rooftop  taliesin im going to try as im running do i have enough time to try and take a shot  matt you can yeah  taliesin am i going to be able to keep up with he group  matt probably not  taliesin never mind damn it never mind  matt so youre like shit and /none/ you just keep running it now jumped over onto this rooftop and  raishan has moved up toward the center and making its way towards you at this moment another burst  of fire over the wall much closer goes boom and swooping out of it out of the flames you see the  largest red dragon youve ever experienced come swooshing through the flames rises up past the  two other dragons almost lower their heads as it passes over  sam maybe they just want their gold back  matt whoosh it swoops past without even noticing you /none/ all slams onto the top of the  palace causing part of the entire throne room glassdomed structure to shattering noise  shatter and break inward before it turns around and plants itself outward youve seen ancient  dragons this is large for an ancient dragon in fact by its sheer size you feel like you may  have have encountered this individual before when you were passing through the plane of fire  laura that fuck that was like the biggest dragon ever ever  sam i dont remember that  marisha they guy we missed because we laid /none/ low from him and he flew over and we were like  dont move and we missed him  matt as it lands the two other dragons take a step back and recoil and snarl and you hear this  voice come just tearing through the center of the cloudtop district saying move on umbrasyl i  claim this as my domain now the rest of you have a task to complete go i shall remain and set a  new dominion of the chroma conclave  sam whispering chroma conclave thats so cool  matt at which point the /none/ two other dragons snap at each other and they both the black one just  takes off in this distance the green dragon stalks for a second and then snarls angrily  turns around and climbs back onto the top of the wall and then flies off into the distance as well  both of them heading westward  laura west  sam oh were okay hey guys its fine  matt you watch as they curve around and start heading east  laura east  matt at this point you guys have now reached the outskirts of the tree /none/ and you can see now this  large red dragon has planted itself  laura he died he died  matt hes fine he flew off its fine just begins breathing flames into the center of the  cloudtop as you can briefly see javelins being thrown bolts being shot and you hear a wave of  screams in the distance as it rains death through the center of emon youre at the tree keyleth  where are you going where are you going  marisha where are we going what are we doing do we want go back to /none/ the keep  marisha what do we do  laura to the keep get underground  travis we need that skull  marisha what  travis the skull grants a wish  marisha grog  sam just get to the keep we can talk about it there  marisha i cast transport via plants on the fucking tree  matt the tree opens up and a small oval almondshaped portal and you can see its in the  intensity its partially unstable but its keeping itself clean you guys each dive in as the  antilife shell vanishes  laura /none/ i shout gilmore before i go though  matt okay and you come leaping through the center of the tree as it closed behind you  and were going to end tonights session on that point  liam thought we were going to be starting a brandnew shadowrun campaign next week  sam you know maybe the warden of that jail was a dragon and he invited his friends to find us  laura did this all happen because we went back to general kriegs place did we kill the entire city  because we went back to general kriegs /none/ place  sam but think of the 4000 gold we got laughs  laura or maybe this was a long time coming and it just happened to time up  sam well find out  marisha im hoping its the first im hoping its the first  matt we shall see if all of these interests come to reveal themselves in the future  liam that was frightening man  matt  for future episodes of critical role  marisha what did we do  travis you just massacred people you just committed genocide  matt i just destroyed something /none/ that i built its a really weird feeling  laura you destroyed your whole city matt  marisha the whole city everyones dead  travis well done  sam not everyone just a couple of dozen people and gilmore  laura this is act two of the game of the video game that youre playing  marisha holy fuck  matt so with that folks as it closes on 11 oclock we have to get ourselves a rest for the  evening we hope youve enjoyed tonights game i
