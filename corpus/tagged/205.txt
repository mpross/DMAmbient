episode of critical role  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  matt welcome back everyone last we left off the mighty nein had been traversing northward  towards the labenda swamp to make good on the first of two jobs they had accepted from the  gentleman back in zadash upon traveling northward you made a young feathered friend by  the name of kiri whos been under your protection since you briefly met cali who is a  dragonblooded sorcerer who joined you for a length of the journey you managed /none/ to discover  where the seemingly cutoff and abandoned safe house was beneath it discovered what had been  responsible for it going silent by an underground tunnel network run by swamp merrow you engaged  with them found a strange altar room where they had amassed everything they had stolen from the  safe house slaughtered the present shallow priest and his protectors took what was necessary and  what was of interest from that pile including an interesting orb made your way back out closed  the pathway the merrow had to the safe house thus establishing its /town/ true safety once more and  completing the job of which you were tasked there you spent an evening resting and began  heading back out to return from the northern center of labenda swamp towards the town of  berleben and to where the next leg of your journey takes you mighty nein as you begin  heading southward into the daytime of the thick heavy swamp what would you like to do  travis i forget are we returning back to report in between missions or are we doing a twofer  laura i can send a message /none/ to the gentleman so we dont have to go back  sam how can you do that hes terribly far away  laura i keep wanting to use this spell that i have but i havent been able to do it yet  travis what spells that  laura its called sending  travis sending  laura yeah i can send a message  liam that is a literal description  travis i guess that would cover it then  laura but its one of my most powerful spells you guys so if were going to fight somebody i  /none/ dont know if its smart  ashley do you send an actual message or is it a piece of paper  laura its like a piece of paper of the mind  ashley ooh  travis you lost me a little  laura do you want me to do it  sam shouldnt we get out of the swamp first what if there are scaries around  travis what time is it about in the sky parts  matt if i recall you guys had taken a long rest after your previous battle so now its  midmorning id say /none/  travis jester maybe not just yet maybe before we go to sleep  laura at the end of the day  taliesin well like so many good things we can do it back when we get to the hotel  laura okay do we want to go find that troll guy  ashley to get that 100 gold back  marisha i did almost die which was pretty awesome  travis and remember he bleeds damaging liquids  laura so we stay far away this time  marisha do we have any more boomboom sticks  sam i think /none/ we have one we can go blow up his house that seems petty  travis or something that we would totally do  marisha he almost killed me and definitely killed our guide  sam yeah we should blow up his house  travis im down for that  marisha sounds fun  travis two votes three votes four five votes  liam i defer to the group  travis are you abstaining  liam no okay lets go i do not have a cat in this hunt but whatever you want to do i will  support  ashley /none/ throw it in and see how it goes and then we can run if hes how do we know if hes in  there though  taliesin you can sneak up take a look rob it and then throw a stick of dynamite in just  because if were going to be those people what happens if hes actually there  marisha wait what do you mean by those people do you know a lot of people who throw dynamite in houses  taliesin yeah i feel like thats pretty obvious at this point  travis i feel like i /none/ knew that about you  taliesin i just like having a game plan  travis sure maybe we have nott bolt in right everybody else stand back because youre super  fast right  sam yeah i guess  travis very dextrous  sam sure  travis yeah then you run in and toss that sucker if he pops out we light it up from afar  sam so im going to be carrying an explosive device into a trolls house solo  laura no you just throw it in the door you dont have to walk in  sam /none/ just to play trolls advocate here what if its not his house  laura i know thats the thing right  sam what if were blowing up an innocent trolls house  taliesin then we should rob it first  laura well send frumpkin in first  taliesin therell be a body curing if it is his house well know because therell be a body  curing and getting nice and ripe  liam we also had no qualms about sending a highly decorated richter to the guillotine so i dont  know why we are getting tied up over /none/ a troll  taliesin i feel that as well  marisha he definitely has 100 gold on him just saying possibly so much more  sam lets go check it out  laura its on the way back anyway  taliesin well give you the dynamite and if anything seems like it goes wrong you can  immediately signal caleb and well bring the cavalry in  sam okay  travis caleb you got that photographic memory you remember where those damn daggers are in the trees  liam i remember the way this way  matt what is your /none/ marching order if i could ask  liam oh boy i am right behind whoevers in the lead  matt all righty whos in the lead guys  taliesin and laura fjord  ashley ill go behind caleb  taliesin ill go behind yasha  laura ill go next to molly  marisha ill take up the rear  matt all right nott  sam 30 feet to the right  matt and kiri will stay with jester  laura yeah she can ride on my shoulders again  matt and frumpkin  liam frumpkin is scarfing it on my /none/ shoulders  matt got it fjord does that mean youre leading through whos responsible for navigating  liam im a couple steps behind fjord saying that way once in a while  matt make a survival check please  travis im glad thats you  taliesin thats not bad  liam that is a 15  matt very good  marisha you get a gold star very good  matt you follow the pearlhandled daggers along the treeline until eventually you break southward  to the northern side of the ounterloch you continue to follow it southwestward from your  /none/ current position curving around the outside of the lake eventually you make your way back to  the treeline where you were before at one point theres a faint shift in the greenery looks like  a vine maybe has moved and you recognizing the placement of it manage to stop fjord from  stepping into it as you pull him back you guys watch as there is now a cluster of vines at the  base of one of these trees and what looks like thorns on them appear to be jagged and in rows  laura is it /none/ a trap or is it organic  matt you dont know  liam im sorry dm could you say that again because i was busy rubbing it into travis that  caleb is stronger than fjord  sam vines  matt you saw a patch of vines that were tangled at the base of one of these trees that you managed  to stop fjord before stepping into the area  taliesin do we recognize these vines and what kind of plant this is  matt make a nature check  taliesin well see how this goes no  marisha /none/ can i do a scan and look around  laura nott it could be a trap come look and see if its a trap  sam okay im coming  marisha can i do a scan and see if i see anybody responsible for making the vines move  matt make a perception check  travis wow  marisha yeah man its pretty bad eight nope ten still getting used to my stats  matt you dont see anybody responsible for that  sam i will visually inspect it for traps  matt all right make an investigation check  /none/ sam nope  liam we want the numbers though  sam eight  matt does not appear to be trapped there are no other cables or lines you dont see any signs of  anything else either holding any tautness to it they seem slack  laura can i follow the vines along and see where theyre coming from  matt as you look at them theyre just centered there at the base they either might be coming out  from under the tree or part of a plant network right there  taliesin ive got a weird idea  /none/ sam lets walk around them  taliesin everybody back up a bit im going to take a little bit of my jerky im going to wrap  it around a ball bearing make a little baseball out of it im going to chuck it right into the  middle of the vines  marisha what no its good jerky  laura yeah do it  matt as soon as you hear beaus words its good jerky you watch as the vines suddenly wrap  around where it was and begin to coalesce and twist around it you watch as they /none/ tighten and  tear and hold there  taliesin i love camping  liam feed me  matt then they begin to slowly shift in your direction the vines moving noises  travis back up  laura oh no its one of those things again just go around it  marisha lets just run were just going to go  matt its not very quick you watch as this poor cluster of jagged vines different than the  mantrap youd encountered before slowly circle around and eventually give up after you guys very  easily make your distance  laura /none/ i throw little bits of moldy pastries at it because i feel sorry for it  marisha aww feeding the plants  travis and it throws it back  matt doesnt seem to have much interest in them unfortunately  laura well its still really good  ashley itll get hungry maybe later  matt pressing on youre heading back to berleben or are you searching for this hollow you  found before  liam i was leading everyone back to where this troll was  matt make another survival check for me please  liam i know exactly the /none/ direction of north and i remember where we were that is a nine  laura you know were going to get lost in this swamp forever  liam but i have perfect memory  matt you have firm memory of directions you know which direction youre traveling and you have  liam but it all looks the same  matt yeah you dont have the ability to suddenly know where everything is that youve been you  have a good sense of it and you can guide better than most given most circumstances but you also  have not grown /none/ up in a swamp and after a while the pattern recognition begins to fade a bit and  you discover after youve been circling for a bit stumbling upon your own footfalls youve lost  about two hours of travel in the middle of the swamp  laura and ashley oh no  liam it looks just the way i remembered it though  laura maybe we circled around for two hours the first time and we just didnt realize it  taliesin thats entirely possible  matt knowing that you do take knowledge of the current source of sunlight /none/ above the canopy  following that heading in the western direction from where you were eventually you come across  that similar sound distant chimes  sam what was that  laura those were the bone chimes  sam oh no thats scarier than wind chimes  laura should we be stealthy  travis yeah we should be stealthy  laura should i cast pass without a trace on us  liam and sam yes  sam is that all of us  laura yeah stay within 30 feet of me okay  travis big times are coming nott  /none/ sam i dont want to dont make me go in there its a troll house  laura nott  sam what  laura bless you now you have advantage on stealth checks  sam okay  matt so are you all staying back  laura yeah  matt how far back are you staying  marisha should we do a circle surround the perimeter just in case  laura lets do a semicircle around where the door is  matt here this will make it easy to establish the scenario  sam hes got a map  taliesin we remember /none/ what not to do right which is  sam no what  laura dont attack him up close dont let him get close to us  travis yeah guys distance is key  matt there is the hollow with the central tree there  travis and were coming from  matt you guys are coming this direction so north would be that direction you guys are heading this  way where would you guys like to be placed  sam semicircle right there  laura yeah  liam i would like to be on the absolute side of the semicircle /none/ please  laura is this rough terrain is this swampy or is this normal ground  matt its normal ground where its green and then rough terrain where its water  laura okay oh thats oh no  matt kiri has her dagger out and is currently  laura oh no kiri stay behind this tree next to me  matt there  laura no behind it yeah  marisha hiding in that tree  ashley i feel a little exposed  sam notts over there  matt there you go as youre preparing yourself kiri looks over to you /none/ with a big smile with the  dagger out and goes as jester i dont know if its smart  sam kiri i dont either give me the boomstick  laura who has the boomstick  travis you do now  sam i have the boomstick  laura okay be stealthy you have advantage  sam what am i doing im going to see if this is the trolls place  laura youre going to see if the troll is inside  taliesin youre going to take everything that you can grab in there  ashley frumpkins not going in /none/  travis its an unnecessary step just blow that thing up man  laura what if the trolls not in there though  travis then you blow it up anyway  laura then we can go steal stuff  marisha do we go steal stuff and bounce  taliesin and then blow it up and run  ashley yeah  laura so find out if hes in there  sam all right  marisha wait is frumpkin dead not to be insensitive  liam you just touched his tail  marisha oh hey buddy sorry  laura maybe he should /none/ go in there  marisha yeah maybe we send frumpkin first  sam but frumpkins not as i mean yes that would be great but frumpkins not as stealthy as  i am  travis if you want i can go  liam you cast pass without a trace on all of us  laura yeah  sam im okay  taliesin but its only up to 30 feet away from her  laura thats true  sam i have advantage though  laura okay go in there nott do it  sam im going to run up stealthily  /none/ matt roll your stealth with advantage nott as you come up along the side  liam plus ten  sam and matt its not plus ten  liam i thought that  laura it has to be within 30 feet  sam 22  matt all right  laura so caleb youve got plus ten right now  matt as quietly as you can you turn around the corner walk this little swampy land bridge  dipping down to about your waist in swamp water but in a very slow steady path begin to emerge  your foot finding the /none/ roots at the base of this large now hollowed tree you turn around the  corner  sam im wearing my ring of waterwalking by the way  matt thats true you do actually so you tip tap across it the softest ninja run youve ever  seen you can almost hear dance of the sugar plum fairies as you go glancing inside you do see  currently in the process of chewing something you hear a crunching sound and then a slurping sound  and then some subtle eating noises  travis smoke that for me  sam i /none/ will stealthily back away so theres no way he can see me to the side and i will  laura wait can we all hold our attacks for as soon as the troll comes out of the tree  matt do you want to hold actions when it comes to it  ashley yeah  marisha sure  travis ill hold eldritch blast until hes visible  liam i will hold fire bolt  marisha ill hold a throwing star  matt essentially it would be a surprise round so you wouldnt have to worry about holding necessarily  laura /none/ okay  matt he doesnt seem to know youre there  sam am i able to light the boomboom stick  matt do you have flint and steel in your equipment  sam im looking  laughter  travis did we send him out there without matches  ashley great idea  sam i have thieves tools and i have acid  laura well sneak back here  liam i pull out the wire and say what are you doing throw it in  sam i dont have a match  liam oh i could light it from here if /none/ you just toss it down and dive  sam what  ashley i have i probably cant hear you guys  marisha like you throw a fireball and make it go  sam im going to come back  marisha oh my god  matt nott scoots back around the corner as you guys are all waiting patiently  travis hows it look  sam its definitely the troll i just need someone to light this for me or give me a match  or something or light something on fire  laura just use your thing dont you have /none/ like burning hands or something  liam its hard to control  laura just light a finger on fire and just touch the thing  ashley i have a tinderbox  sam oh great great  travis but is it a long wick  marisha and laura yeah  matt its about that long  travis oh geez  matt make an intelligence check actually  laura you could run and do it  sam intelligence eight plus something  laura oh thats good  sam intelligence check 11  matt 11 you have some understanding of basic alchemy you /tavern/ know probably the way this is treated  it wont burn super fast youre not sure you could have anywhere between 24 to six seconds once lit  travis this is such a drunk fourth of july problem  taliesin you have full running speed though  travis jester  laura what  travis go with him  laura why  travis youve got pass without trace just

gliding over the swamp you  hear the insects buzzing and various dragonflies making their way through so you have it now floating  in front of you yasha  ashley okay ill light it  matt its going  sam okay im going to move toward the thing and make mage hand go in front of me all the /none/ way into  the hole  matt okay you get right around this corner make another stealth check as youve now dillydallied  around for a bit  laura oh thats good you still have advantage  sam okay 25  matt okay  marisha and youre within 30 feet right  laura oh and plus ten  sam 35  matt no idea youre there but there is a faint hissing sound and from the inside you see the  shifting movement of the large hulking troll beast on the inside of the hollow kind of pause for a /none/  second in the middle of chewing  sam the mage hand is going in  matt silence  laura but i  sam what did you do  massive explosion  matt if i could get a pair of scissors please  sam what youre going to cut your beautiful work  matt well yeah you blew it apart  laughter cheering  matt thank you kindly  travis look its got roots and all sorts of beautiful things  liam if i could get a pair of scissors please  sam should

me please  sam me okay  laura thats only 2d6 of damage oh no  sam double ones  laughter  liam ooh thats some stale dynamite  taliesin that was a bottle rocket  matt a concussive blast blows apart the hollow you see pieces of shrapnel go flying in every  direction the only one who is not currently protected is you nott i need you /none/ to make a  dexterity saving throw please  sam on my own blast  matt well not from the blast this is from the shrapnel of the tree hollow that has exploded  outwards in all directions  travis im unprotected  matt youre far enough away where i dont think it would get to you  sam 11  matt thats okay you take half damage  laura if you take so much more  matt you take three points of bludgeoning damage from pieces of wood flying in your direction the  troll is however knocked prone /none/  cheering  taliesin hes harder to hit from a distance at the moment  matt from a distance yeah however i need everyone to roll initiative  sam we did this to ourselves  liam yes natural 20  matt hes aware that you guys are there now  marisha you think  matt well say for the purposes of this ill give you each one action to do something  laura okay  sam not me i did my action  liam i like that the blast didnt knock him down he was just so scared to death /dung/ he went ah  matt 25 to 20  liam 21  sam 20  matt a natural 20 on his sorry caleb was  liam 21  matt and

marisha a fjour by fjord  matt i think this is a surprise round the troll cannot act this turn well just let it go that  way because hed be going up with you caleb on the same turn hes on the ground dazed and  stunned what are you doing  liam a firebolt goes from my hand that is a natural 20  travis yeah come on now  /none/ liam with my vax die we will use this one that is a three 11 doubled is 22  matt 22 points of fire damage nice the bolt impacts the flame curls across his now currently  black blasted chest and back area the flames as you noticed in a previous battle has prevented  its regeneration  liam i didnt actually even want to come here ah  ashley he can regenerate  laura he cant hes burned  marisha they do normally though  travis fire  matt from the battles youve had and from watching the previous /none/ strike you now notice the  impact and as the time progresses over the next round the wounds are not knitting themselves back  together so that finishes your turn are you going to move  liam no ill stay where i am  matt finishing calebs go nott youre up  sam okay ill shoot my crossbow and miss with a nine  matt you have disadvantage because hes currently prone  sam

surprise round because technically hes dazed  sam oh thats no good 13  matt 13 does not hit  laura oh no  matt it manages to ricochet off of the outer parts of its hide even though its burnt and  scarred its still thick you watch as the bolt reflects off it molly youre up and then beau  taliesin im going to come out from behind my tree right there just a little bit so i can see  /none/ him im

and grapple him and ill send projectiles  marisha that sucks four damage  matt four points of damage to the troll  /none/ marisha im going to spend a ki point  matt as you throw it you watch as it splinters off of its body and there is a splash of poisonous  toxin  marisha like a rock in his face  travis yep like a pebble  marisha like a pebble im going to use a ki point to do patient defense  matt all right you go into your defensive stance preparing for any sort of assault towards  you yasha youre up  marisha did i go my full speed  matt no you didnt  marisha can /none/ i move back a

his venom spray it lumbers forward its darkened with angry blasted soot and flame  scars it rumbles toward you its strange bulbous midsection wobbling as it steps through the swamp  towards you it looks like an even more swollen meg mucklebones from legend reaches up with its  claw and tears a giant wound across its chest as it does dark green venomous liquid sprays out in  a 15foot cube in front of it hitting both of you i need you both /none/ to make a constitution saving  throw please it takes seven points of damage from its own claw  travis we had to have 100 gold didnt we  marisha

minute  sam and laura oh no  matt you take nine points of poison damage beau and you are not poisoned  taliesin but you can save against that right every turn  matt yep at the end of each turn you can repeat the saving throw to try and get rid of the poison  so thats going to end its turn next caleb  liam yeah okay so im going to keep it simple i will move as close as i /none/ can probably getting

turns over nott what are you doing  sam /none/ i will fire once am i at disadvantage or anything  matt nope  sam oh i still missed 11  matt that does miss unfortunately  taliesin are we seeing sprays when he gets hit by these things by the way  matt each magic missile the spray is still jumping off of its body in these very  proximitybased sprays of terrible toxin so yeah its still happening  sam

around as i can yeah  matt as youre rushing past  sam that one hits 19 plus something this is not a sneak attack though  matt correct  sam well poo six points of damage  matt six points of damage to it as the bolt sticks in the back you watch as one of its  bulbous pustules sprays venom behind it impacting nothing in its proximity  laura how far does it look like the pustules spray  matt between /none/ five and ten feet youre not entirely certain from your visible standpoint  because youre kneeling behind a tree with partial cover that finishes notts turn molly youre  up then beau youre on deck  taliesin how far can i move in one  matt 30 feet  taliesin okay im going to head in the direction of this creature im going to stay about  actually lets try something ridiculous you took a lot of damage from that spray right  marisha nine not as much as yasha  taliesin thisll be fun lets run up to it /none/ see how close i can get  matt in order to make it with your distance youre going to have to leap across that bit of  open swamp water  taliesin im going to try to leap at that just north of me to see if i can get over here then  by that spiritual weapon if i can leap there  matt thatll be the rest of your movement youll be right there and thatll be the end of your  movement  taliesin thats fine at least itll hopefully give everybody some flanking  matt okay /none/ make an athletics check  taliesin thats a four  matt counting you trip and fall down to your knees in the water 20 25 and thats about as  far as you can move on this turn  taliesin thats as far as i can move

 laura oh no  matt it sees it coming towards it and whooshing past its head and you hear it  shattering somewhere in the distance you glance past it and theres a pile of skulls and bones  that were previously charred from the impact that currently now are doused in oil  marisha that didnt go as planned sorry  ashley do you want to move  marisha yeah im going to step back  travis run singing sail /none/ away sail away sail away  matt how much full movement  laura as far as you can get as far as you can  marisha yeah a little bit more im going to go behind that tree there yep thats fine  matt

roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier  laura roll better than beau  marisha do better than me  ashley oh no seven /none/  marisha damn it  sam does it at least land where the oil landed  matt it does you see behind a pile of freshly dampened oilcovered skulls burns like a nice  little bonfire behind him  ashley is he looking at it  matt it looks at it and looks back at you about as incredulously as a troll can like  ashley im going to go back as far as i can  matt i should have actually rolled at disadvantage  on that but it would have been the same  marisha we still would /none/ have sucked  ashley still would have been shit  taliesin there is a tiny burning fire there now  ashley i roll for a save on the poison  matt you do at the end of your turn make a constitution saving throw  marisha that would have been really cool in theory  taliesin it would have been  ashley 17  matt you manage to shrug off the poison  ashley good call  matt good all right that ends yashas turn jester youre up  laura from out of the flames comes the spiritual weapon from /none/ behind and its going to come up and  spank him on the butt  marisha heavy metal lollipop  ashley come on lollipop  laura 14  matt 14 just misses it strikes across its shoulder but glances off and slams into the wet  sickening swamp floor with a sucking sound it has to pull itself out by wedging back and forth  laura aw man i pop out from behind the tree and say i was aiming for your butt and then im  going to cast guiding bolt at level three  matt oh shit all /none/ right roll your attack  laura damn it fuck mother bitch no it doesnt hit  taliesin theres a lot of threes in this game right now  matt you watch as behind booming  sam oh no its got a mate  matt a tree blasts back from the guiding bolt slamming into already rotted roots needed that  one final nudge and the tree behind uproots itself and falls  laura did you guys see how powerful that was super powerful im going to run away im going  to turn around and run the other direction yep /none/ right there  matt all right that ends jesters turn fjord youre up  travis im going to move over here five ten 15  sam youre going closer  travis yeah im going to cast witch bolt at it  matt go for it level one what level you have to  travis yeah whatever it is 3d12 i have to roll to hit first 16  matt 16 does hit  travis hi d12 i missed you counting 18 points lightning damage  matt plus a d6 because it has hex on it  travis thank you for /none/ the reminder two solid 20 points  matt 20 points of damage im putting this on there for witch bolt so if you wanted to use your  action again you can continue to hit it every turn for a d12 automatically now you see as  fjord steps around the corner and releases this arcing bolt of purplishblack energy this  lightning arcs off and slams into the troll the energy continues to swirl around it it tries to  stop it and grasp for it to no effect theres this strange thread of faintly visible energy  between /none/ it and fjord right now theres some sort of connection between the two of them all right  that ends your turn fjord  travis it does  matt the trolls going to go first because it rolled higher than caleb immediately it turns  laura no  matt no its real angry at him because it just got hexed blasted and then bolted its going to  bypass the shiny swords right there  taliesin does it get close enough for me to take a swing  matt it does  taliesin swing swing i just get two attacks /none/ right  matt you were holding your action so you get two attacks yeah  taliesin actually im going to use the good sword it doesnt matter thats awful and thats  pretty good thats 11 that misses and 19 that hits  matt that does hit  taliesin thats 1d6 plus 1d4 2d6 now thats right thats not bad thats ten points of  damage  matt ten points of damage as you strike it with one blade and miss with another immediately as  you strike across it with your blade the venom splashes into your face you /none/ suffer 13 points of  poison damage and then it moves out of your combat range you can still take your reaction if  you wanted to  taliesin i will take my reaction 13 points of damage  matt yep  taliesin thats fine this is what im good for im taking it  ashley 100 gold  taliesin 100 gold natural 20  cheering  taliesin new die  laura and taliesin its a pretty gold die  taliesin does the fact that im using what effect i have  matt it does not appear to be undead /none/ so its 2d6 plus and then double whatever you roll  taliesin so its 4d6 plus a little  matt yeah if you wanted to do it that way  taliesin ooh that pretty much does the same thing counting 21 points of damage  matt as you carve past with a third final swing towards it you cut through a portion of muscle  and tendon on its arm there which immediately slips dull to one side unmoving the spray  splashes back in your face for only five points of poison damage  and its coming into you /none/ as soon as that arm goes limp the muscle reconnects and the arm  comes back with strength angrily its going to swing its going to take a bite and two claw  attacks against you  taliesin hes also going to of course curse of the eyeless  matt you cant you already used your reaction to attack him  taliesin oh that was my reaction never mind  matt sorry buddy  taliesin thats all right  matt for its bite attack against you its jaws open fjord that is going to be a 26  travis that /none/ hits  matt you take ten points of piercing damage plus six points of poison damage and you are poisoned  until the start of its next turn as the venom courses through your veins its teeth and giant  tusks dug into the front of your shoulder and chest the pain is strong but its holding you  fast from there like a clawed wolverine it begins to rake at your chest with its claws on  each side the first ones going to be a 16 to hit  travis that misses  matt right because you have /none/ your shield out the shield blocks one of the claws the other one  attempts to reach behind it to get to your body thats going to be a 19  travis that hits  matt with the other claw strike  laura is he grappled  matt no he is not that is nine plus four 13 points of slashing damage  travis highpitched yelp i mean deeper grunt  matt and another three points of poison damage  travis jeez louise  matt thats going to end its turn  laura and marisha run away  matt caleb /none/ youre up  liam oh this thing is way closer than i was prepared for i take a little bit of molasses and  rub it on my hands and say slow down you boys have got this good and i start to back away  casting slow as i go i will loop around by our cleric he has to beat a wisdom save against 16  matt wisdom save that is a 14 minus one 13 no  sam what does that do to it  laura it slows him i think  matt half movement he can /none/ only make a single attack on its turn  liam he can do an attack or a bonus but not both  matt i need you to make two concentration checks by the way your hex would be gone technically  which is my fault hex is gone and make constitution saving throws to see if youre  maintaining your witch bolt  travis thats an 11 that one saves they both save  matt all righty good on you  travis i think it was four you can add four hit points i think was the last hex damage /none/  liam it was a cube but caleb knowing that would put the troll in the corner and send the rest of  it in that direction  matt i assumed as much okay  liam cant use reactions  matt correct  laura oh good  matt all right caleb that finish your turn  liam ja  matt nott youre up  sam is it in melee with good old fjord  matt it is  sam oh thank god i mean not for you ill run up within 30 feet  matt all righty you move counting /none/ 30 there you go  sam and fire ooh

taliesin i want to get the new sword push let it bend and pop into it  matt as you stab through its body it tries to spin and you watch this strange tensing of its  abdominal muscles and its weird bulbous stomach suddenly bursts out in front of you fjord  travis im /none/ down  matt yeah you take ten points of poison damage  travis ah it was so cool  matt it looked almost like molly killed them

wounds in fjords unconscious body /none/ suddenly sucking noise siphons out hovers  in the air for a moment as mollymauk is holding his hand and then the poison drops to the ground  and disseminates into the swamp  laura what  ashley what that is so cool  taliesin ive never done that before that  matt what are you guys doing  laura wait are you awake then fjord  matt fjord is still unconscious

straight way but yeah  laura now you have used all your movement and you cant pull him away /none/  marisha step of the wind i have double movement  matt counting 40 so you have thats your  marisha okay and im going to grab onto him and im going to turn to yasha and im going to say  help me and im going to pull when she gets up to it  matt okay so you spend an action just to hold onto him you currently have him grappled  marisha im going to pull when she gets up im going to help her pull him out  matt okay got it yasha  ashley so /none/ im going to move forward grab the other side that she doesnt have and pull him  matt all right so you move over action and youre going to pull him away all righty you are  not in melee range so you manage to pull him back here fjord you get  taliesin he has no reaction  matt i know he doesnt so you pull him back fjord is now right there  ashley how far back can i pull him  marisha i want to assist her though can we get him further if i assist that /none/ was the whole point  of me doing that  matt hmm it gets a little wonky with action but ill let you do it  marisha okay  matt with the speed you have left you guys can pull him about there  marisha if not if she can handle him then  matt well its half speed through the swamp and then its half speed dragging somebody so its a  slow shift because youre moving through the muck and dragging him out of this thick swamp so  thats as far as you can get  marisha /none/ okay  matt it does not get any reaction though because its currently still affected by the slow spell  and it looks like right now fjord is in a position where he is outside of the splash radius which  would trigger caleb and nott  liam scorching ray  sam oh firing  matt you fire and you are using the scorching ray from the glove  liam yeah first is a 20 second is an 18 and the third is a 20  matt all hit  liam they all hit  sam 22 to hit for /none/ me but its not a sneak attack  matt roll damage no theres nobody in range of it right now  laura oh  sam disgustedly five points  matt five points of damage its still conscious  marisha kill him kill him  laura five points if you get more than five points hes dead  liam i did a total of 27  laura yeah  matt how do you want to do this  liam there is i am with these people and i am going to burn his head off  sam laughs  ashley here /none/ we go  matt as you turn the glove sparking as you release these three blasts one strikes his chest  and ignites his arm begins to burn black this one hits the other shoulder and you watch as the  torso begins to ignite the third one finally hits right in the jaw and you see the shadowed line of  its face eyes and mouth open before fire crackling incinerated to ash i need you to go  ahead and make a wisdom saving throw please  marisha oh shit caleb  liam highpitched oh shit oh shit /none/  fünf  matt calebs arms kind of just fall slack and he slumps to his knees staring at the nowflaming  corpse of the troll as it slumps into the ground and begins to burn halfsubmerged in swamp water  half of it now just this burning mass of ash and flesh  laura whoa  matt so  laura that was really graphic  sam oh hes still down  laura oh are you dead or something  taliesin oh yeah weve got to wake him up now cause hes almost dead  laura ugh i go over /none/ and i use another  matt go ahead and make a death saving throw  laura healing spell  travis 19  matt yeah youre fine all right its fine i just like making him roll  laura yay i do cure wounds on him again stop doing this  travis ugh i feel like this is a rough day  laura ooh 11 points this time  travis 11 points i sit back up against the tree and sit there in the water britches in the water  just not caring  marisha beau gets up seeing caleb a /none/ little bit messed up and im going to go up to him and im  going to grab him and be like lets take a walk  matt you pull him away hes not present currently  marisha thats fine im walking with him a little bit slowly  laura im going to take my axe and im going to try to cut out his heart just in case very  slowly so it doesnt splatter  matt you have to wait a moment because currently the body is being engulfed eventually the flames  die down to the point /none/ where you can carve into its body but most of its flesh is burned its  definitely dead make a medicine check  laura okay 12  matt you manage to eventually hack away get to where the troll heart would be and carve it out  without damaging it beyond any interest in this piece its a deep forest green looks like it has  halfformed additional ventricles that never fully completed its pretty disgusting and you go to  touch it and your fingers  laura i dont want to touch it im going to use my fabric /none/ and try to get it out like a cloth or  something  matt okay you pull it out it is corroding the cloth slowly  laura ah does anybody have anything glass or metal  taliesin yes  laura put it in there  taliesin no im not going to do that  laura why it squirted poison  matt its that big its about basketball size  laura we can keep it  taliesin what are you going to do with that you dont want that  laura im going to sit on the ground im going to /town/ look through my stuff see if i have anything  that can hold it  taliesin im going to go through the skulls do you want to join me going through the skulls right now  sam i was going to go to calebs aid but seeing beau walk away with him i nod and go back to  looking through the skulls for gold  taliesin lets not crowd the boy  matt okay both of you guys make investigation checks as youre looking through the rest of that  yasha what are you doing  ashley im going /none/ to start walking over towards where the skulls are  sam 20 for me  taliesin ten  matt unfortunately the concussive blast of the dynamite shattered most of the bones and any  materials that were in here so what wouldve at one time been fairly easy to scavenge what remains  you gather from the patches of now dried and destroyed swamp ground that much of it has been  scattered all across you do manage to find some coins between the two of you mostly you nott  and it takes some digging youre basically having to /none/ pan for gold here youre going in the muck and  having to sift through your fingers and pour your water out a bit take it into the water you  manage to find roughly 26 gold pieces ten silver pieces and lets say about 50 copper pieces  marisha quarter of what we came back for but sure  laura does his body have a pouch on him at all can i search the body  matt the body of the troll make another investigation check  marisha wheres febrons nasty body  sam yeah any other items that /none/ werent destroyed  laura 13  matt theres basic hides wrapped around the midsection there is a small pouch you go inside  and pull through and immediately your hands hit something that feels very cold and somewhat slimy  looking inside looks like there are slivers of muscle fresh muscle that had been torn off of  some sort of a body laid in there the smell is a little bit putrid it may have been in there  pickling for a while  laura hey nott i found some pickled muscle for you  sam what kind of /none/ species  laura the slimy kind  matt you can make a medicine check to try and identify it  laura man my medicine checks are sucking ten  matt ten probably human  laura its probably human  sam ill take that  matt caleb you shake out of it  laura im going to take the hide he had covering his junk and wrap it around the heart because  obviously it can take being splattered by venom  matt yeah okay that it does in revealing the partially singed troll dong you also manage to  properly /none/ wrap the heart for its own use  travis us and troll dongs man  matt each campaign its a through line guys  sam can we keep the dong  laura i dont want the dong  taliesin theres no sense repeating  matt so fjord what are you doing  travis im sitting there watching caleb and yasha walk off and feeling sorry for myself  matt okay caleb you manage to snap out of it and come back to reality  marisha i hand him one skin and i say here this ones water this ones booze /none/ take the water and  i pour it out on one of my sashes and dab off his forehead a little bit you all right  liam ja  marisha cool cool cool cool  travis yall mind if we take a short rest or something  marisha yeah lets do that theres a campfire over there that yasha and i made with the oil and  the torch that we threw its already done lets go sit by that  laura sit by the skulls  matt its a pile of bone and skull shards that is still burning /none/ and will be burning for a while from  the oils  laura its cozy over here  marisha can i get my oil flask back too  matt no that flask

ashley you took care of the problem  marisha yeah i feel like those two arent mutually exclusive or anything but yeah  laura lets start walking  marisha all right  taliesin its just getting awkward  matt all right you guys continue making your way back towards berleben you made most of the  journey and by the time the sky begins to subtly grow dark with the threat of dusk imminent in the  next /dung/ hour or so you guys begin to make visual on the lantern lights in the outskirts of the  northern side of the city within a short time before it gets too dark in the swamp you manage  to make your way inside berleben proper  laura we did it  matt youre still in the puddles  marisha is there another inn other than that bougie terrible underground situation  taliesin did you just say bougie ugh god never mind i dont like you again  marisha that was pretty bougie  laura yeah we were in the /town/ bad part of town we can go to the nice part of town  liam what is this word bougie  marisha when you want to try and seem fancy but its a little ostentatious  liam is that in common is that a common word  taliesin its a word that people use when they want to sound ostentatious about how ostentatious  something is  marisha yeah its short for bourgeois which is super ostentatious  liam the zemnian word for that is like seven syllables long  marisha thats ostentatious  laura im going to cast sending /none/  sam oh youre going to send a message whats the message completed first half of mission  laura yeah yeah yeah  sam send money  taliesin its collect when we get back  laura im going to cast sending and send a message to the gentleman  marisha safe house cleared  matt okay he cannot respond though right  sam you can reply to this message  matt oh can answer in a like manner immediately  laura im going to say hey mr gentleman we found your safe house we cleared it out of a  /none/ bunch of fish people dont worry everythings fine now okay we also found a troll in the  swamp we killed that too and we also found some crocodiles please respond to this if you need  anything let us know okay  taliesin and his agent is dead his person out here is dead  laura and your agent out here the guy with the no teeth is dead  matt seeing as how the spells limit is 25 words  laughter  matt theres a moment where you hear in your mind a familiar voice of the gentleman /none/ going i think  i catch your gist well done keep trucking you hear the confused rise at the end  laura he interrupted me while i was telling him what we did  sam yeah there was still more to say  laura yeah there was so much more but i think he got the idea well get the bonus  marisha jesters that person who keeps trying to record the voicemail and gets cut off aw  rerecord one more time  taliesin or trying to send an email how does this work all caps  matt as /tavern/ you guys are having this conversation near one of the lanterns you see a cloaked figure  thats sitting on a bench suddenly stand up and face you and begin to walk towards you  marisha wait were in the tavern  matt youre walking through the puddles  sam scatter scatter  travis no  sam take to the sewers  matt the figure approaches somebody in the tech sneezed i think  marisha can i pull and grab my staff a little bit  taliesin just ruin everything there we are  matt i know  travis all /none/ i could see is somebody go fart sound  matt the figure approaches and pulls the hood back and you see a scruffy chin the unkempt  hair a dirtier but excited horris thrym  marisha oh my god horris oh hes not dead  matt he goes well word of a motley group of strangers spreads in whispers and i knew it had  to be you based on the description my friends youve come this way this place is miserable oh  do not think that i dont appreciate what youve done for me please  travis no /town/ youre right on the nose its pretty miserable  marisha yeah this place sucks  matt as rough as this journey was id rather be here than in prison what word of zadash has come  is dolan all right  marisha hes fine he was sitting pretty next to the other diplomats of the town  laura yeah he seemed like he was doing pretty good when we saw him  taliesin except of course that theyre making ready for war  matt ive heard whispers of that as well  marisha did you see that crazy army ride /none/ by there was a lot of horses a lot  matt ive been here for over a week so no but im sure there was how long should i stay what  is the current atmosphere there  liam that is a big question mark at the moment  sam its chaotic  matt is it safe to return or should i hang low a little longer  laura you know what it might be because i think they decided to charge other people with the  crimes and stuff  travis the gates were pretty heavily watched though  /none/ laura were they still though are they  travis at war  laura i dont remember  liam perhaps wait until you receive word from him  matt okay ill remain in this quaint city  liam well he has a better eye on the situation than we do hes right in the thick of it now  matt thats true ill be patient thank you all so much i really appreciate it  laura horris do you have a lot of diamonds on you maybe some that are worth 300 gold  taliesin so thirsty  matt no i /town/ dont but if i do ill let you know   laura im on the lookout okay  matt i genuinely wish to make this up to you at some point if it is diamonds you require ill  begin looking  sam do you know anywhere in town where they might have that many diamonds  matt he stops and looks around the city and goes i dont know if this is the place call me crazy but  liam is there anything of use or value here at all  matt fish swamp fungus herbs  laura poisonous /none/ troll hearts  sam you have it ah  matt he steps back  taliesin where would we sell such a thing like this  matt he starts thinking for a second then goes maybe there and points to what is another two  story building that had been burned and left to rot that now appears to be a hollow structure  that is overgrown with greenery and plants  taliesin is that an apothecary do you have an apothecary here  matt it seems to be from what ive noticed in passing  taliesin my god i miss /none/ shopping im going to give him three gold for his trouble youre  brilliant and im heading in that direction  matt thank you thank you all if you see dolan tell him please come get me  travis no fear we wont be too much longer were going to head back to zadash after we take  care of some other business and well be sure to check in word will find its way to you soon  matt thank you  marisha where are you staying right now  matt im over at the drowned nest  marisha /tavern/ and travis the drowned nest  marisha how are rooms there are they underground and filled with water and mold  matt no theyre better than that place and he points to the keystone pub where you guys stayed  the night  travis who would stay there right i mean  matt not to my standards  taliesin its quaint and rustic shut up  marisha the drowned nest do they have a tavern at the drowned nest  matt im sure you could acquire a drink trust me most of the folks here have to  travis do /town/ you feel safe here i noticed your hood was up when you approached us  matt just precautions not a lot of business happens here that you wont get mingled in unless  you were looking so i just stay put  travis well send word it was good to see you  matt you as well if you pass by the drowned nest hopefully we could have a drink and he  makes his way up towards the central part of the town the midway docks  laura man im glad hes alive i thought he was one of /none/ the dead bodies we found at the safe house  marisha me too  travis where the hell did molly go  laura he went in the apothecary and i take off running  matt you approach and there is a sign thats hanging from a chain from two iron hooks that are  long rusted this dull brownred color it reads across the front the fungal fount  taliesin what kind of font is it written in  travis papyrus  matt never enter if its papyrus  travis no business back there  matt so you approach the /none/ door is closed currently  taliesin i go to knock  matt sorry were closed  taliesin youre not buying today  matt were closed its sundown and im shutting up  taliesin already what time do you open tomorrow  matt sunrise  taliesin are you sure you dont want to perhaps buy a fresh troll heart  matt pause what  laura i have a troll heart its full of poison  taliesin very wet  matt make a persuasion check  sam we got a real wet troll heart  laura do i roll with advantage because /none/ molly is helping  matt you are helping ill give you advantage on this roll that was a roller coaster right there  taliesin not a bad die there  liam you two just became that muppet meme that was made  laura 22  matt theres a moment and you hear multiple locks clicking the door opens and on the inside  you see a wildlooking gaunt dwarf he has a chin beard with green moss growing on each side of it  his clothes look a little moist and his forehead glistens with sweat and he peers through /none/ his  eyes popped out you said you have a troll heart come in opens the door and lets you both inside  closes the door behind lock clicking im sort of curious as to how you came across this troll  heart did you kill the troll  laura we killed a troll  taliesin we found a troll and we killed it  matt thats amazing im very impressed um ah  laura do you want to see it  matt i would like to very much place it on this counter please on the leather which you /none/ carried  laura i open the leather and place it down squishy noise  matt he reaches over and grabs metal tongs and starts pushing  laura hey  matt im inspecting it  taliesin let him prod its fine  matt takes a moment to look around i can see theres some very fascinating applications that  could come from this  laura there are a lot of aortas and chambers and stuff  matt it is quite exquisite i would be happy to buy this off of you do you have an asking price  or would you /none/ like me to make an offer  taliesin or could we also talk about trade possibly if you have some interesting stuff  laura probably you could buy it and also give us some stuff  taliesin if youve got stuff to trade you seem like a clever fellow im sure you got something  around here thats interesting and unique  matt without breaking eye contact he starts rummaging behind this small wooden table that acts  as his counter which has a bunch of planters and potted weirdlooking swamp fungus and plants that  are grown together and /none/ entwined one of them you lean close and a little spore goes off and you  back away carefully you hear the clinking of glass and he pulls up two small jars opens and  says i could spend the night preparing perhaps for some medicinal potions   laura really strong ones  matt strongest youll find this side of the labenda  laura is that regular or stronger than that  matt i dont know i have to brew it to find out its not a perfect art form you are impatient  taliesin well see what you /none/ put together and well definitely talk about what this is worth in  the morning and if you have anything unusual that you put together if you have a signature blend of  any kind im always interested in people who are excited to experiment  matt unusual  taliesin yes  laura but im more interested in the healing potions  taliesin that too  matt right the morning then  taliesin well see you bright and early  laura take the troll whats your name by the way  matt smithe smithe durban pleasure to meet you  /none/ laura smithe durban  taliesin do you think it would be better to leave this here so he can contain it  laura no  taliesin i mean we killed a troll its not like we cant kill him if it goes wrong  laura nope im taking it with me  liam vex is back  sam smithe durban is knows or has a gimp  laughter  travis 100 for sure  taliesin why must you sully everything good and pure in this world sam  liam there is a halfling wrapped in parchment paper underneath the shop /none/  taliesin this is where all those manacles have been coming from oh no  matt they havent invented the zipper yet so its laced  taliesin perfect well be back in the morning lets go take a rest  matt very well goodnight sleep well return please closes the door multiple locks clicking  laura what a nice guy  taliesin i really liked him  laura i did i liked him a lot  matt so what are you guys doing for the evening  marisha lets go check out the drowned nest shall we there is a /none/ better place than the  keystone pub we head to the drowned nest  matt you head to the midway docks following the outskirts of the drydocks which are a number of  these wooden docks that head out into various edges of the swamp where there are small boats  that are currently roped off and being watched by the crownsguard that come across with torches  make sure that nothing gets stolen or anyone is doing anything untoward over in the area asking  around you eventually find your way to a relatively simplelooking building single story  /tavern/ but it stretches quite a bit and you can see a number of windows that are faintly glowing with  candlelight on the inside it does appear to be a simple inn with a small bar in the far corner  its better than the keystone pub but only incrementally entering inside its relatively  quiet looks to be one person who is drinking alone on the far end and you see across the way a  female human in her middle age a warm smile with a cracked face who glances up from a small book  that she /none/ is thumbing through and goes good evening folks can i help you  travis yes you can were weary travelers in need of respite and perhaps some drinks  matt well i can provide both my name is uma cole pleasure to meet you  travis uma kiss  matt oh well  travis was that a dirty hand  matt oh no i keep quite clean  travis i was asking out of character but okay did you give me the dirty hand maam  matt i was trying to process what that was referring to oh you stop /town/ no the hand was clean  travis okay  matt we do have about four rooms available for rent if yall are willing to stay for the evening  our selection of liquors and beers are not extremely versatile but welcome to provide as needed  travis that sounds absolutely fantastic  taliesin whatever you think that we shouldnt leave town without trying  matt very well that will be five silver per room for the nights stay  marisha well take them all  matt all four rooms that will be two gold pieces please  travis i got /none/ it  taliesin you got it  laura thanks fjord  travis no problem thanks for making sure i was okay back there  matt what a gentleman  laura i saved his life multiple times today  matt well good for you  taliesin to be fair hes saved our lives dozens of times  marisha hes very dapper he touches the hearts of all of us where would we be without fjord  taliesin all gone all dead  laura yeah i mean hes not that cool or anything i mean you probably wouldnt be  interested in /dung/ him at all  matt course not im sorry  liam are you interested in him  matt herere your keys strangely surrounded by a group of strangers now accosting her with  various degrees of insinuation drinkswise we prefer more hard liquors or more of an ale beer  marisha liam and ashley hard  taliesin any surprise you have  matt well only a couple of surprises at my disposal but  laura do you have any ginger ale or fresh milk  matt she pulls up this dark green bottle and uncaps it its beer but its /none/ practically ginger  ale not very alcoholic she hands it over to you  taliesin you cant drink in real life and you still wont drink on graph paper  matt a round of liquor for all of you guys will run you about three silver pieces its not very  expensive  travis ill do that as well its exactly what i have  ashley what book are you reading  matt oh nothing and she tucks it under just keeping my mind busy anyway welcome to stay if  you like we dont have food available here you /none/ may have to go over to the keystone pub for that  but we do offer finer sleeping arrangements  travis is it a busy night any new travelers anyone that caught your eye coming in before us  matt not to the degree that you have no  travis well im flattered  marisha well im going to go get a drink  taliesin ive got cards im going to play and im going to drink and weve got to discuss  whats happening tomorrow  travis true well find our way over to a table  marisha yeah /none/ ill go get a table does someone want to tuck kiri in  matt kiri at this point is leaning up on the counter towards the woman and goes like jester  dont eat humans okay the woman goes aw  laura shes the sweetest isnt she shes wearing a mask shes not really a bird and i  take her  matt make a deception check  laura oh thats surprising 20  matt she goes children and their costumes  sam yes i know right  laughter  matt she grabs her book and starts reading from behind /none/ the counter  taliesin can i see the cover when she grabs the book  matt actually its just plain leather  laura whispers its tusk love thats definitely tusk love  matt so what are you guys doing  travis we head over to a table in the corner to discuss  matt you got your drinks theyre functional at best this isnt a bad establishment but its a  plain establishment but it works its you guys and one other patron who currently seems to be  deep in their cups making it on their own they are /none/ out of earshot you have your own table  travis well we seem to be doing fairly well how do we feel about setting out in the morning to  sam shadycreek  travis yeah shadycreek run  taliesin yeah im ready  travis ophelia mardun  laura sounds good  sam was there anyone else here that we were supposed to see or anything else we were supposed  to do  liam no we are on a bit of a time crunch  sam we have to stop by this fungus place to get some potions  taliesin /town/ well do that on the way out as soon as we put the cart together  laura it opens at sunrise so we should be good  taliesin weve done what we needed this is a one troll town i think not a great time to be had here  travis yeah we can catch up on some rest we got to get the carriage right get the horses back  laura yeah theyre at the docks or something  travis that means i got to go over to the where did we stay before  marisha the keystone pub /none/  travis ive got to get it from that guy  laura he dropped them off at the place  sam the central stables  marisha we paid way too much money to have him store our horses  travis yeah but we dont know where the stables are  laura the central stables we have to ask where they are we dont have to go back to the other  pub dont worry fjord  taliesin they may not give them to us unless hes there  sam hey yasha  marisha i have validation its okay  sam /none/ yasha i saw you

attention so i can go snag it real quick  ashley okay would you like me to try to  sam i dont know  ashley okay  sam ill cast mage hand  taliesin oh why not another round please and ill put a gold for everyone down  /none/ matt okay she goes oh of course ill go ahead and get that for you she closes the book  and puts it beneath the counter and runs off and grabs the bottle that she had previously poured  and shakes it its fairly empty so she grabs another and then heads over to your table and  begins to uncork and fill the drinks  sam as shes filling ill mage hand back and try to grab the book  matt okay you do not see where it is you still have to have visual  sam okay ill /none/ walk over there then  matt make a stealth check  sam thats not great 14  ashley you could just be looking  matt okay she walks and is pouring drinks and looks over her shoulder in your direction and is  still pouring but is looking at you  laura kids huh theyre always wandering off  matt apparently  sam goo goo ga ga do i see where the book is now  matt you do see it from your perspective but she is watching you  travis uma has anyone ever told you that you have /none/ eyes like the sea  matt make a persuasion check  sam imitating guitar  travis shit nine come on thats my jam  ashley yes uma they are like a sky blue  matt she finishes pouring the drinks caps it up and goes well i appreciate the flattery i  really do have a wonderful night then walks back towards where she was sitting but as she  does so her eyes are locked on you nott goes back to her stool  sam damn it fjord what was that what was that thats not how you talk /tavern/ to a woman  travis im not real practiced im sorry  sam your eyes are like the sea were in a landlocked part of the place here she doesnt  even know what that means  travis i shouldve said like the swamp right your eyes are like stagnant water green and no  green and yellow in places  liam i walk directly up to the bar  laura they look like a troll took a shit in them  matt can i help you  liam yeah im good on drinks i was just curious what it /none/ is that youre reading  matt roll a persuasion check  liam for a question okay  laura she doesnt like us very much  marisha yeah she hates us  matt shes had a bad series of minutes with you guys  liam just a nine  matt im reading a fine story  liam is it fiction  matt it is  liam i am so starved for a good book weve been in the wild for a while i dont suppose theres  i doubt it but is there any place to find literature here  matt /none/ i had to order this from zadash unfortunately  liam that sounds terrible how long does it take for it to get here  matt well the order goes out there and pay upon delivery it took me the better part of a  month to get here  liam i commiserate for your thirst for fiction i struggle with it myself how far in are you are  you almost finished with it  matt im about three chapters in its just starting to get interesting  liam is it a page turner  matt yes  liam okay /none/ im obviously just a little bit jealous but i dont want to take you away from  your reading time  matt make a perception check  liam nine  matt theres a little bit of text just barely visible at this proximity to the cover of the  book but you cant make it out in this low light  laura does it look like a t with a u with an s with a k with an l  matt she takes it and closes it and puts it beneath the counter is there anything else i can /tavern/  help you with sweetie  liam no thats fine enjoy i give her a wink and i go back to the table  ashley this is going to drive me crazy  sam lets fucking kill her and take the book take everything in the place  marisha we have been wanting to buy a bar  travis yeah but you know what they say its location location location  marisha yeah this town sucks  travis yeah its really not that good  ashley im going to go up to the bar  matt shes just pulled the /none/ book out and looks up and goes hi  ashley hello heres the thing youve made this very intriguing this book that youre reading  and i cant leave here without knowing what it is  matt make an intimidation check  marisha were you being intimidating  travis the brachial artery flexes in her bicep  ashley my intimidation is minus two but we said we can use  matt well it depends on how youre being intimidating are you going to physically threaten  her to show the book  ashley no no  matt then its charismabased /none/  laura you got this yasha  matt this is subtle  taliesin no  ashley that would be a zero because i rolled a two and my charisma is minus two  matt she goes i apologize but southern drawl i apologize  all southern drawl i apologize  matt but your behavior paid customer or not has been lackluster and i would appreciate if i  could have my privacy  ashley i will give you privacy i just dont understand why we cant know what youre reading  matt why are you so interested in what im /dung/ reading  ashley because it looks like its very good i will go sit down fine i miss reading i miss it  a lot  laura i have a book you can read yasha  ashley i want to know what shes reading  sam jester and molly you have not tried yet  matt dungeons and dragons  liam we plan a heist for tonight we wait until shes asleep  travis in the morning well send her for the horses and the carriage and perhaps its time we  turn in i pound mine molly are we /none/ bunking up  taliesin im finishing this and ill be right up  matt all right you guys finish up your respective drinks  taliesin i go last  laura i feel like we only need three rooms  sam its just an extra couple gold  taliesin i leave two gold on the counter before i leave for you no matter what but if you tell me  what it is i promise i wont tell the rest of them i just want to lord it over them  matt she palms the two gold she goes its called /dung/ feathered leather  taliesin enjoy your evening cheers and i head upstairs  matt she pockets the gold happily  liam its about vax  laughter  matt some bard somewhere in the past has penned a story about a dark knight in leather and feathers  marisha ive seen that tumblr post  taliesin for the record i tell none of you  matt you guys manage to get your evenings rest you gather your things and the next morning  laura wait before i go to sleep i want to use my pearl of power and regain a /none/ 3rdlevel spell  and i want to cast sending on my mama and im going to say hi mom i got a new spell i want  to say thank you for the package you sent me i know that it was really hard for you to do that  and i love you so much and i hope everythings okay with you and i got your letter and the ink  and i think its so  matt as youre talking you hear in your mind this gasp jester i dont know how but its so  good to /none/ hear from you did you get my package  laura oh no can i respond to it oh no  matt she pauses well wherever you are i love you and i hope you are well if and it cuts off  all groaning  marisha maybe next time if you write down the words so you can know which are the most  important words  laura okay i need to tell her i got her package  matt i wasnt counting the words but i think that gets the gist of it probably somewhere in  there im /none/ sure ill get 14 tweets going like that was only 22 words its fine  taliesin three of those tweets will be from me  matt i know oh i know taliesin thats why im nipping this in the bud yeah  travis before we turn in turn in its just molly and i in our room right  can i confide in you for something  taliesin oh yes please  travis im a little unnerved about this sword would you stay and watch for a second  taliesin this seems like a bad idea sure  travis all /none/ right ill summon the wastehunter falchion  matt as it emerges from your grasp you can see theres the slight splash of sea water across the  wall there you can see in the center of the pommel previously was just the wellcrafted hilt  to the blade you see a single yellow lidless eye on each side  taliesin does it look like anything does it remind me of a mystic symbol of any kind  matt make an arcana check  taliesin just an arcana check lets see what happens natural 20  laura whoa  taliesin im /none/ back baby  matt theres no religious symbology here in thinking through theres nothing that gives you  the essence that theres any sort of belief system locked into this that youre aware of looking at  it one it immediately reminds you of whatever it is he jammed into his stomach and two the image  of it and the seabased theme of these experiences that fjord has been having leads you to believe  that this is something very old and something that resides probably beyond land and possibly  beyond the sea thats as much as i /none/ can give you which is more than you shouldve gotten but you  rolled a 20  travis does the iris move at all or is it static  matt currently its just static  taliesin what happened to you on that boat  travis um  taliesin something might have followed you  travis nothing like this ive never seen anything like this eye before only in that dream  where vander was holding it pushing it into his chest but this is smaller this sword just seems  to take in things  taliesin youre going to forgive /none/ me for this later i cast friends  matt okay for the next minute you have advantage on your charisma checks  travis i forget what friends does  matt it doesnt do anything to you it just gives him advantage on charisma checks  travis oh okay oh nice  taliesin actually im so sorry not friends its charm person  matt youre doing charm person  taliesin im so sorry its charm person  matt make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin thank you  travis why did i ask thats an 18  matt he resists it /none/ you feel your mind begin to cool with subtle arcane influence and you shrug it off  taliesin theres something in you that you either dont want to talk about or dont remember  properly i think  travis well you couldve just asked  taliesin no i dont think i couldve  travis if anything its the latter  taliesin i know  travis theres not a lot i remember about being in the ocean  taliesin which is why i didnt ask  travis right  taliesin i trust that youll tell me everything you know but im /none/ not sure you even know  everything you know  travis maybe but thats why i asked you to stay in the room im not entirely sure i trust this thing  taliesin i dont think it matters where the sword is at all  travis maybe can i try and focus on the sword i close my eyes put both hands on the hilt and  just concentrate on it real hard  laughter  matt sword of sea eye give me sight beyond sight go ahead and make an intelligence check  just a straight roll with your /none/ intelligence modifier  travis oh thats a ten  matt ten you grab it and you focus and you focus and much like an element of the dreams  youve had and the spells that you pull from whatever this agreement youve made with this  entity may have been you can feel that thread connection from you to something beyond your  hemisphere its like that sensation of someone looking at you and you just know someones  looking at you and you turn to look and theres nobodys there its like that all the time  right now /none/ but you cant read more than that  taliesin perhaps i think may i  travis dont take any offense but no i make it disappear  taliesin something from the deep is in that i dont know it reminds me of something  travis yeah me too im just not sure what please i only confided in you because i feel like  the strange is your ballpark  taliesin ill keep an eye and no matter what keeping each other safe its what we do its  what you do when you got a group of people  /none/ travis agreed  taliesin well keep you safe  travis i appreciate it molly ill turn in  taliesin ill probably be up for an hour then ill turn in  matt okay as we go to rest for the evening lets go ahead and make this our break so well  come back here in just a few minutes to pick up the story for the next leg of your journey in the  meantime guys enjoy these next few minutes enjoy the videos and chaos in between well see  you here shortly  break  matt welcome /none/ back everybody lets go ahead and dive back in as you all come to consciousness the  following morning a much more comfortable sleep than that you had at the keystone pub you  gather your things upstairs

her way by herself  taliesin no i didnt say that i /none/ said if we know which direction she needs to head we can figure  out possibly if we can get her there  laura okay  marisha i think we need to get her out of this swamp because this place is terrible and i  wouldnt want to live here  taliesin no one should live here  marisha im not going to subject a poor little child bird to that  taliesin she does drink a lot and occasionally seem interested in eating human flesh im not  entirely well thats a subject for another day  marisha /town/ youre right she could grow up and run this town  laura she could be like her own gentleman  marisha oh my god shes her own mob boss  laura gasps i hope so  marisha i like that i have high hopes for her yeah  laura maybe i can talk to her and have her write down exactly what her parents look like or  something and i can try to send a message to them  marisha okay i think thatd be good well start there put a pin in this for now  travis just /none/

into the fungal fount and there you see waiting anxiously theres the  sallow dwarf sitting in a small chair in the corner going ah so where is the heart did you  bring it  laura right here  matt right okay so ive been working on something for you based on what you requested and  /none/ i have these he puts these two vials on the table one of them is a healing potion larger  than the basic kind the other is a sky blue color and as he sets it on the table as soon as it  impacts theres a flash and you see some sparkles kind of going energy crackling through it before  it settles and he goes im going to be honest not entirely certain the extent of what this is  it protects you from something i know the basis of it is insulation  laura whats the gold /none/ stuff in there  matt i do not see what you mean  laura whats the stuff that swirled around when you put it on the table  matt he taps it again and energy crackling it looks like a spark  laura what is that  matt i dont know but i bet its interesting  taliesin if we knew the name of everything we put down our gullet there would be no fun ever any  time im very excited  sam its riboflavin  laura what else  matt i will trade these and put a topper /none/ of 50 gold pieces  taliesin im all right with this  laura i think that sounds like a pretty cool deal  taliesin im into it yeah  marisha ill throw in for it ill throw in 25 gold  laura wait no beau no hes paying us  marisha oh i mean  travis holy shit  marisha im pulling a grog  matt youre totally pulling a grog  marisha i thought you said it was going to cost an extra 50 on top im sorry yeah give us that  money  matt all right if /none/ you dont mind  marisha deal  matt he grabs the leather and carefully moves it off the table and puts it in a small chest closes  it goes and counts out 50 gold pieces shoves it your way and goes thank you for your patronage  taliesin so if we were to take that 50 and possibly spend it on something in this shop is  there anything that we should take a look at  matt depends on what youre looking for i have various balms and salves to help with headaches  wounds that are festering /none/ some that help with helping your manhood come to light some that help  you with sleeping if youre having insomnia  marisha whats the manhood thing  travis and sam oh boy  laura they help you sometimes guys have problems with the tongue click and then theres  potions that can help with that  marisha ah  laura my mom said  taliesin im curious about the sleeping thing you have and again anything youre particularly  proud of  laura im going to look around the store  taliesin im always excited for a surprise  /none/ matt essentially over about five minutes of him showing you around theyre mostly general herbal  remedies for day to day ailing elements it looks like all the special stuff that he had at his  disposal went into those potions everything else has been general helping like melatonin things  that help you a little bit  taliesin ill take some sleep aids and whatever helps you sleep some sleepy tea or whatever  anything like that  matt all right thats five silver for ten doses  sam whispering get the manhood thing  taliesin you buy your /none/ own issue whatever youve got a problem with you can buy it yourself this  is not where my coin is going and anything that smells nice just whatever  matt there are some lavender oils i would recommend to you here it is i hope you like it  its quite nice he rubs some on his wrist yes  taliesin how much for the whole deal  matt for the oils and your sleeping ill put it around ill say seven silver pieces  taliesin can you do change one gold  matt i can he gives you /none/ three silver back  taliesin thank you  whispering and giggling  marisha were having our own story over here  taliesin im aware im ignoring it  matt you guys finish up there  taliesin im fine im going to put it in my additional notes right now  matt okay you guys are heading off to the edge of the swamp with kiri  liam this is so silly im looking for a good stone  sam what kind of a stone a big stone a skipping stone  liam no something with a little bit of heft /none/ to it  sam do you need it for a spell  liam not exactly i dont really have anything specific i guess ill know it when i see it  something about yea big you know my father used to tell me that if a stone had a ring around it  all the way it was lucky  sam if a stone had a ring around it  liam yeah like a natural formation a coloration right it doesnt matter though i  start looking for a stone  sam kiri help us look for a stone  /none/ liam a good one  sam ill look with him  matt chirping make an investigation check one of you with advantage if youre aiding the other  liam i will make the check with your help if thats okay  matt sure  liam okay that is a 13  marisha with advantage  liam oh that is a 14  matt all right what particularly are you looking for  liam a stone about as large as a malformed baseball i suppose  matt okay it takes you upwards of ten minutes not very long until you find /none/ one thats roughly  that size its not perfectly spherical its got its imperfections but its pretty smooth  liam is there a ring around it  matt ill say theres a very faint ring around it sure  liam thats a lucky rock  sam what will you use it for  liam im not sure exactly i have some ideas  marisha murdering people in their sleep  sam you know caleb i never told you this before but when we met that dragon lady carrie  kaylie kali  liam cali  sam cali thats a lot /none/ of ks she gave me this scroll of invisibility ive been hanging onto it  but i didnt know if you wanted to look at it and maybe learn from it or something  liam i mean does an armored bear shit in the woods oh yeah i want to see it let me see it  sam here here yes i didnt want the others to see it just in case  liam ooh thats a good one ja  sam do you want it can you learn that now  liam i mean i could use it right /none/ now but that seems detrimental if i had proper funding and  materials but maybe later im going to keep it safe for the moment  sam great also im so sorry that i got you in trouble with beau for the whole bowl incident i  didnt realize that she was going to freak out on you like that  liam neither did i but were figuring it out  sam you took a walk with her was that okay was it awkward  liam ja that was fine shes probably a good egg  sam i think so /none/ too in her weird sort of stoic way she seems to care about you  liam yeah shes a prickly pear but shes not a bad person  sam do you think she was dropped on her head or something shes very sort of you know  grunting you know what i mean grunting  liam i think you and i are a little eh in our own particular way  sam yeah yeah thats true  liam i mean shes abrasive but that has its uses right tool for the right job right kiri  matt as jester go /none/ fuck yourself  laughter  liam kiri knows what im talking about  matt chirping  liam youre good youre still good  sam im very good yes  liam things are looking up i think  sam things are looking up and you know earlier you said that i could come talk to you whenever i  want and thank you for that that makes me feel very good yeza was his name the halfling man  before thats all i just wanted to say his name out loud its been a while  liam thats a good name /none/ names are important  sam yeah but you got your rock  liam got my rock  sam all right lets rock out  liam kiri come on  laura before we leave or as were leaving the store i want to say molly stay inside for a  little bit okay and keep talking to the guy okay for just a minute  taliesin all right  laura im going to use my paint and im going to change the sign to the fungal fart  laughter  matt all righty make a sleight of hand check if you /none/ dont mind ill give you advantage if you  manage to succeed on a deception check  taliesin all right what are you going to do with that heart anyway  matt well i have many possible uses i could extract all sorts of  taliesin thats a seven  matt so just make a roll  laura ooh 20  matt with a quick flourish you complete a fairly accurate recreation of the font utilized in its  glorious papyrus without him noticing from behind the door with that you go and complete your  conversation the rest of /none/ you meet up just as you hear the clomping of horse hooves all of you  gather in the center of the puddles the clomping is this splashing as theres still two inches of  water in this section of berleben wet clomping  marisha ugh i think im getting athletes foot from all the moisture in my shoes from this place  laura i can heal that  marisha really its so itchy  travis yeah its called jungle rot  marisha ugh really  laura hey youve got our stuff  travis whose stuff  taliesin is everything /none/ relatively all right on the cart doesnt look like its been  matt you guys take a moment to look through everythings intact  ashley we had to kill them all but we got it  travis yeah yasha was surprisingly effective  laura thats not surprising  taliesin i trust you its the only way to be sure  matt kiri comes up like caleb shes probably a good egg  marisha what does that mean  sam she couldve learned that from anyone anyone with a mildly zemnian accent  matt like nott yeza was his name the /none/ halfling man from before  laughter  sam shut up shut up kiri  matt like nott shut up shut up kiri shut up  laura yeza  matt like nott yeza  laura was he the halfling guy  travis did you say yeza kiri  matt like nott yeza was his name the halfling man from before  liam the gimp we were joking about under the floor of that place  laura aw  sam aw what dont look at im turning green  matt all right you guys gather your things get back onto your cart /town/ and your horses and head  southward exiting berleben leaving this swamp town behind hopefully for good making your way  back onto the road which direction are you going you have a map  marisha wheres the map  sam northeast  travis northeast to shadycreek run  laura while everyones figuring it out  sam wait we have to go around hupperdook  laura hupperdook  matt you guys heading to hupperdook on the way  marisha or we can go through hupperdook  sam theres a ridge line there right theres mountains  matt those are high /none/ mountains  sam silberquel ridge  matt the silberquel ridge is a very high series of mountains  sam we would have to have to go around it  laura so wed pass by hupperdook  matt there are roads or there is cutting through the open fields and nature thats your choice to  make looking at the map here  taliesin we have some weights to put down  sam so we have to go around these mountains we can either go to the east past hupperdook because  were going to nogvurot right up there  matt /none/ you guys are heading this direction as far as you know shadycreek which is over here in the  corner  sam and liam shittycreek  taliesin but there seems to be the crossroads up there there seems to be a path through the  forest  sam we could go around hupperdook way or we could go rexxentrum way  taliesin i think we go rexxentrum just because theres an army marching that direction  laura but rexxentrum is the capital  liam that place is very busy  laura we should probably stay clear and go to hupperdook /none/  sam youve been up there havent you caleb  liam yeah but theres a war brewing and that place is the center of it all  sam but you might know some folks who could help us  ashley that man trent ikithon or whatever is in rexxentrum  laura that trent guy  ashley yeah that trent guy  marisha wait is in where rexxentrum  ashley yeah dont you remember when we talked to him he said if we wanted to meet up with him to  talk more he was in rexxentrum  liam i thought /none/ we were on a timetable to get these things done for the gentleman  travis and were trying to be sly we want to avoid eyes  laura tell you what well go hupperdook on the way up and then we can do rexxentrum on the way back  marisha im just going to say ive heard some pretty crazy stories through the grapevine about  what goes on in hupperdook  sam what goes on in hupperdook  taliesin i dont believe youve ever heard a crazy story about anything happening anywhere  marisha are you challenging me  /none/ taliesin im challenging you for details  marisha so all right citys got a lot of gnomes and theyre filled with industry and they  work all the time but at night they party  laura gnome parties  marisha work hard party hard its what that citys all about  laura and they live in mushroom houses  marisha i dont know about the mushroom houses thing but ive heard some crazy they have  ragers every night  ashley ive heard gnome parties are the craziest kind  sam are you making this up  marisha no not /none/ at all  laura insight check  matt make an insight check both of you  sam 18  laura 13  matt as far as shes aware shes telling the truth  laura thats amazing  marisha im just saying ive had some shady friends  liam aint no party like a hupperdook party  marisha ive had some shady friends  travis hupperdook it is  sam lets dook it up  marisha i think they have one of the highest imports and exports for illicit substances i  dont know thats just what ive heard  sam /town/ okay lets go  travis lets get it started  matt you guys are making your way along the rillway road eastward from berleben heading from  here along rillway heading past north of felderwin hitting the felderwin tillage and then  theres a crossroads that leads to the northern gravelway path  sam were going that far  matt if youre following the roads if you guys are cutting away from the roads and going through  the rough open fields that can be done  laura we have a carriage lets stay on the roads  matt via /town/ road its about 110 miles to the crosswo crossroads and then 120 miles along the  gravelway path  marisha to hewe to the cwosswoads  matt its about a weeks worth of travel to get to hupperdook from where you are  marisha whats in the cwosswoads  matt youll find out when you get there you havent traveled there before  marisha is it a village we dont know  sam ive been there havent i  matt you may have been there actually the crossroads from what your experience is folks  who are making long travels /town/ stop there and might set up shop for a day or two to sell or trade whatever  wares they have before they continue on the rest of their journey and people from felderwin and  the felderwin tillage head up there sometimes to set up shop if there are people that are traveling through  laura like a flea market town  matt kind of its less a town its maybe a handful of anywhere from four to 20 tents  depending on what time of year it is  laura its an outlet outside of town  matt /none/ its a fantasy outlet  sam cabazon  marisha yes  laura i bet i can get 300 gold worth of diamonds for way less  sam we need that and our money exchange  laura which by the way i want to talk to you guys heres the thing this spell that i have  takes diamonds in order to bring you back to life i dont have enough gold to buy all these  diamonds for everybody so  liam so youre asking if we would like to pool our resources for a handful of these diamonds for /none/  a perilous situation  laura well yeah or if you want to be selfish about it you can buy your own diamonds and then  ill use those for you  travis how big do these diamonds have to be like little suckers  laura doesnt matter its just 300 gold worth of diamonds but theyre going to be gone if you die  travis thats a significant diamond  marisha how do you know which diamonds are our diamonds  laura you keep your diamonds on you  marisha but dont you need them for the spell do /none/ we have a specific diamond pocket that if we go  down you go in our diamond pocket  laura yeah  sam shes got to hold all the diamonds  laura no you have your own diamond pocket and then when i save you itll be like  sam were each going to have a pocket of 300 gold  liam i would rather you as an accomplished healer knew where the diamonds were on your  person and got them licketysplit rather than you looking through my 32 pockets to find the  diamonds  laura sounds good /none/ to me  liam but yeah i agree with you that we should pool our resources that is a good idea  marisha and whenever we steal jewelry off of people maybe we keep it instead of selling it  laura we just pop out the diamonds we can still keep ruby jewelry and emerald jewelry  sam i will look for diamonds  ashley thats all you need is diamonds  laura just diamonds  marisha do you have any spells that use rubies or emeralds what about you caleb  liam this is a little diamond i use /none/ for that one thing i do  marisha but this doesnt go away  liam no this one i spin it and surround it with arcane energy and no it does not go away  laura whats that about how come he gets to keep his  sam are you talking to the traveler right now  liam its a very studied practice i spent years learning how to do it  sam hes extremely smart  taliesin whats the traveler doing up there  laura well maybe he can fly i dont know sometimes hes invisible could it be /town/ hes flying  next to me i dont know  liam could you let her keep the diamonds  laura could we maybe keep the diamonds  marisha could you teach her how to do the spinny thing  taliesin could someone keep their eyes on the road as were moving forward  sam lets go  marisha the traveler is my copilot its okay hes leading the way  liam traveler take the wheel  marisha and travis singing traveler take the wheel  matt oh my god guys  laura while were going i need to sit next /none/ to kiri and im going to pull out my sketchbook and  im going to ask her to write down everything she can think of about her mom and dad and draw a  little picture of them because im going to try to do sending for her mom and dad  matt okay she draws the best she can her drawings are rudimentary but functional you see  two blackbird parents in somewhat geometric clothing  laura thats about how i pictured them  marisha its american gothic but as birds  matt basically best you can tell from /none/ what she writes down and communicates with you via the  book they were traveling from the east heading west  laura so they were going the opposite direction that we are  matt they are yeah  laura that sucks  matt you guys make your way out of labenda swamp heading southward across the bridge past the river  that breaks from the ounterloch heading south  liam just a minor thing while were traveling im going to use my minor alchemy to turn a ring  of the wood in the cart im sitting crisscross applesauce and /none/ i make a ring of copper in the  bottom of the wagon and place this stone in it i place both hands on the side of the stone and im  trying to channel my knowledge and ability into it im futzing with it thats it  laura i take a little paintbrush and i draw a smiley face on the rock  liam i slap her hand  matt because this is a longer journey im not going to drag us through every single stage of it  but there are some elements that can happen during this /none/ journey  taliesin you have died of dysentery  matt yes exactly  marisha did we ever find anything out about the sending thing how did that go thats what i want to  know about first  matt unfortunately given the lack of details lack of information  sam the fact that they cant speak  taliesin at some point we want to pull out the map and show it to kiri and see if she can point  to anything on the map  laura theyre not dead  travis were going to get this fucking bird killed /none/ yall im just saying  marisha this birds going to die  matt the sending spell isnt able to connect with anybody unfortunately but you tried first day  of travel comes to a close you reach the river actually you dont quite reach the river you  almost do first nights rest happens for expediency who wants to make the perception check  for the evenings rest  travis ill do it  liam i will also do it  matt both individually  liam i will do it individually  matt both of you guys roll  laura /none/ i like how this is like final fantasy traveling  travis 16  liam ooh i got a five  matt thats better for the evenings rest taking your breaks keeping watch throughout the  night no incident at one moment there is a shifting of movement in the distance fjord you  go and check and there is a family of foxes that are making their way through the field southward  away as it gets colder theyre starting to move southward and you spook them off to get away from  the traps  travis scat  matt /none/ the next morning you guys get yourselves back up into the cart and continue on further you  pass beyond the river and start making your way towards the crossroads before your second day  comes to completion whos going to keep watch the next evening all right make the roll guys  taliesin do you want advantage  laura lets roll individual ones  taliesin individually 20  laura oh 17  matt keeping watch throughout the evening thankfully no issues happen you manage to keep  watch evening goes without issue your rest is fine and you continue /town/ onto your third day of  travel along the way you do finally reach the crossroads here as you come upon the area you  see where the road diverges it continues in a southward curve and then a road that very starkly  turns left and heads in a northeastern direction there are a series of wooden signs up and you do  see three tents of varying sizes there is a blue and white striped tent a white tent and a faded  green one a couple of carts are stopped off to the side and some folks /none/ are looking in there it  looks like a very small merchant setup there but if you were to inquire you could see whats  available  liam wait a second i send frumpkin skittering off in that direction as hes leaving i say  rub against some ankles and listen  marisha who are you talking to are you talking to me  sam i think hes talking to the cat  marisha okay  laura that would be funny  marisha that would be weird if i walked up to you and said did you want me to /none/ rub his ankles  sam no sometimes when he stares at you and doesnt say anything he is talking to you  though so thats a fair question  marisha no ive noticed that  taliesin have you ever actually tried rubbing his ankles when he says that  marisha can he still hear us or can he only hear the cat  sam he only can hear the cat but he can feel you so poke him if you feel  marisha okay what if i poke his ankles  sam that would be weird  matt frumpkin listens /town/ about and there are folks asking and trying to haggle prices you get the  sense that one of them as frumpkin looks up has a small selection of fruits some looking more  tropical probably further southsourced brighter oranges and yellow in color some with vibrant  green leaves  laura pineapple  sam durian  matt the white tent goes by has more of a general goods feel there are tools repair kits  for travel you see some bolts two crossbows in the back wall all sorts of general tools it  looks to be a general /town/ store and some basic means to defend oneself when on the road  liam any books  matt make a perception check  liam any books 13  matt no books the green one appears to be mainly furs and leathers some that are tanning on the  outside as well as bone jewelry made of teeth and bone of hunted animals  marisha thats cool you guys know tents  sam we also need some warm clothes winters coming  taliesin some tents would be a great idea  liam to justify all of this hes been muttering everything /town/ he sees bones bone necklaces  pineapples  marisha i want a bone necklace but do you guys recognize any of these tent colors  sam i recognize the color green and white  taliesin i generally dont actually care about the theme of any city that im in because ive  never bothered to learn does any of this look familiar before do i recognize any of these  people  matt if you start walking and glancing through no theyre all various travelers no one has  crossed your path before nobody of significance to your previous experience /town/ no  marisha i want some bone jewelry i walk off that way  taliesin i think were going to need some general goods ive got some ideas of some stuff we could  use on the road  marisha yeah you mentioned the tent thing thats not a bad idea  taliesin we should have some tents  matt you head to the green tent those who are going to the one that has the bone jewelry there  is a human woman there dark weathered skin leather and fur over her shoulders shes  currently talking with somebody /none/ and as you approach terribly sorry if youre looking for  furs bones or leathers look around feel free to ask i will tell you what we are selling for  marisha do you have any bracelets a goblin took my jade one  matt thats unfortunate but we do she turns around and theres a few strips of leather that  are rough on the edges but functional one of them has a fur inlay so it feels comfortable on the  wrist ive made these myself  marisha fjord does this look like a little much this feels /none/ like it doesnt go with my outfit  travis are they thick or thin bones  marisha yeah does it feel out of place  matt these are leather  marisha oh its just leather  matt the wristband that she has is leather yeah  laura if you got a thicker cloak it would look real good with it  matt are you looking for bone in particular  marisha yeah  matt there is bone jewelry theres a bone choker thats a series of finger bones that are lined end  to end that goes around the neck /none/ theres one that can go on the wrist looks like theres a necklace  that has a bunch of various canine teeth not necessarily from a canine but sharp teeth from  some sort of creature  marisha where do these bones come from  matt oh most of these were taken from various wolves dire in nature  marisha volves  matt wolves  marisha wolves wolves  matt these are from the zemni fields near icehaven is where i hail its a very  huntertrapper community up there i bring the goods to sell this far south  /none/ travis very impressive  liam frumpkin comes around a corner and caleb sees that the entire party has left him in the  cart snaps out of it and scrabbles out and starts hustling over that way  laura do you buy stuff as well or do you only sell stuff  matt mainly meant only to sell but if you have something worth buying do present please im  curious  laura ive got a gator skin  matt she takes it by the way the gator skin is not tanned its not cured it is fucking nasty  /town/ as you pull it out of your haversack its dripping with congealed blood flies immediately  start gathering and shes like ugh  laura super fresh  matt i can tell not interested sorry  laura we should probably tan this i leave the tent  marisha i buy the bone bracelet throw her money and say thanks and walk off  matt okay you didnt ask how much it was  marisha no  matt the bone bracelet runs you two gold its not that expensive  marisha here  sam i disguise myself as a gnome go in /town/ and buy warm clothes  matt okay for the set of warm clothes which is heavy leathers and fur that you can throw over a  leather cloak as well that you can bundle up in and it straps over and buckles multiple times  across the way for you it runs past your legs almost so youd have to trim it up a bit but  that one will run you three gold pieces  sam okay done  taliesin i want to hit the general store  matt as you approach the white tent you see a female /none/ halfling there who is wearing a leather  apron that has some tools tucked in there theres nobody currently at the station so as you  approach she looks out to you she has frizzy brown hair with some gray ones that are starting  to sprout from the outside thats pulled back and held in this giant poof of a ponytail she looks  out toward you and points and goes oh hello looking to buy something  taliesin actually i am how fascinating that you caught me right in the moment where im ready to  spend money /none/  matt oh great what are you looking for  taliesin well ive got a couple problems  matt problems i have possibly some solutions  taliesin ive got a cart that keeps breaking down on me  matt thats a problem  taliesin if youve got a kit for something like that also i was thinking about maybe putting  some canvas on top of it giving it a little bit of safety from the elements i think im going to  need at least four tents ive recently come into a bunch of new companions and they really /town/ didnt  have whats necessary to make our way through these wonderful wonderful roads

no one is going to find him  marisha i was trying to be jovial im sorry i shouldnt have tried that  laura what if we put some flowers in his hair so when he wakes up he looks really pretty  marisha thats good lets do that  taliesin /none/ theres nothing better than waking up in the morning with no pants and flowers in your hair  liam i have a dagger and im going to shove it in his belt so hes not totally alone hes  pantsless but with a dagger correct  matt pantsless with a crossbow and a simple shortsword thats tucked off to his side  liam oh i didnt see that i take my dagger back hes fine hes got a blade  matt his hair is filled with flowers hes on his side flopping away from the sky the carts there  /none/ if theres anything you need to grab from it  taliesin i add a drop of lavender oil and i think were done  matt there you go  sam was there anything in the cart no right  laura theres blankets we can take the blankets  matt theres a couple blankets theres grain and it has a cover on it  taliesin and this is why you buy the lavender oil  laura molly they have a covered wagon  taliesin so we can remove it and attach it to ours  laura or we can take theirs /none/ and leave ours  taliesin is theirs better than ours  matt the cart is comparable probably a little more weathered than the one you guys have  liam this is so dumb what color is it  matt its a basic canvas its a tan  liam it is oregon trail  taliesin its all about the dysentery  matt its a tan light brown  marisha its a florida convertible  matt yeah  taliesin the volvo of wagons  matt essentially ironic that you went looking to build that and it was already in the possible  /town/ path all right so you guys pull that off  ashley take the blankets  matt take the blankets make your way back to your cart finish up your evenings rest and at  morning light continue your way northward along the road all righty  taliesin clopping sounds  travis thats some tinyass hooves  matt for the sake of brevity since were getting towards the end of the evening  laura we should take the grain for our horses  sam horses eat grass  liam lets count the grains  travis oh my god lets travel north /town/ for fucks sake  matt the next two days go on without issue passing a few travelers heading southward  crossing your way until eventually the silberquel ridge grows more and more prominent in  your line of sight following the path the fields that surround the north road begin to give way to  tall grass and trade for scrub land and rocks the oncevanishing shape of the silberquel ridge  mountains growing bigger and bigger the numerous columns of mingling blackandwhite smoke you can  now see spill from the eastern side of the mountain diffusing as they /dung/ rise as you travel  even closer you can make out the twotiered layout of a city built into the mountain one  large region encircles the very base of the mountain ahundred or more dark workshops and  towers billowing smoke from chimneys and stacks visible a number of large constructions dot the  open spaces between these towers some oversized cannons or others like mobile siege towers one  resembles a wheeled multitiered cart with numerous wickedlooking boltthrowers attached  as you begin to head in this direction you can also see that this lower area this industrial /town/  field of various engines of warfare that are in the process of being constructed some in their  skeletal phase of being built to the base of the mountain above that you can see two winding  switchback roads as well as one very steep staircase that ascends to a second level about a  hundred or more feet above the first here you see a massive outcropping of leveled rock that holds  the other half of the city there along the ridge of the mountain shelf lies hundreds of buildings  and arches occasionally dappled with an /none/ autumncolored tree behind this city mass you  see a shimmering waterfall that cascades from out of the center of the mountain about 1000 feet up  that glimmers like silverwhite light and the little bit of sun thats coming through the  clouds youve reached the outskirts of hupperdook  laura this is not how i pictured it  taliesin i like it  marisha i told you its a city of industry  taliesin i like a good waterfall  sam where are the edm gnomes  marisha well that happens at nightfall  laura is it mostly /town/ gnomes that live in the city  marisha i think mostly gnomes but im pretty sure there are other people i dont know ive  never been here ive only heard stories  laura does it look like the buildings are teeny  matt from best you can tell from this perspective make a perception check  laura 13  matt its hard to tell the buildings that are in the outside of the upper ridge look to be varying  sizes they dont appear to be super tiny by any means you do see from this perspective as youre /town/  heading down to the base of the mountain youre at the top of the hill and this last leg as you  start pushing in towards hupperdook at the base of where the waterfall is hitting behind that  row you can see what look to be numerous towers thin and tall like these weird needles of  buildings that kind of cluster around the base of the waterfall thats as much as you can make out  at this distance  liam on a scale of one to ten one being like a shitass swamp town and ten /town/ being like rexxentrum  what does the civilization of this city look like  matt the technology as you get closer and closer and begin seeing these fields of construction the  industry is pretty prominent its the most youve ever seen as far as the beauty of a living  civilized town five or six maybe  liam but not podunk  matt its not podunk by any means  liam its builded  matt yeah its wellbuilt it seems comfortable  the base area around the mountain as you begin to approach and you can see now where /dung/ the  clouds and bits of steam are mingling and rising up mixing into the sky above you the colors here  are fairly drab browns grays dark graphite metals and immediately you can see the ground  itself  sam coughs thats good water  matt you can see the ground itself as you step in the area has a faint layer of soot where some of  the burned materials that are pressed up into the air have come down to settle onto the ground  surrounding it what do you wish to do  marisha what time /none/ of day is it  matt its midafternoon  laura quietly we should be going to the city  marisha quietly i think so  laura i guess well ride into the city  taliesin id like sleep somewhere comfortable  matt following the path there is a large metallic archway that rises into a pointed  entrance where as you enter you can see in the metal carved in various rivets hupper dook  on the other side there you see two townsguards standing there both human standing guard and as  you approach one of them steps forward /town/ welcome what is your business  travis looking for lodging for the evening weve been on the road for some time  matt understood you would probably want to go ahead and head up the mountain for that down here  is all industry  travis all industry where would we be looking for further up the mountain  matt he points out this is the iron lot and the assembly yard youre going to want to head up to  the idleworks shelf to find lodging  taliesin idleworks shelf  matt idleworks shelf yes  travis any recommendations /tavern/ favorite spots  matt the most prominent and most lively would probably be the blushing tankard tavern  marisha i do like alliteracy  laura blushing tankard tavern  travis iiilliteracy  marisha alliteracy  laura alliteration  liam illiteracy  travis not often you find people a fan of illiteracy but  marisha i like unlearnt folks  travis well we appreciate it well head on up  matt he steps back to his post and just keeps an eye as you guys enter in the midsection at this  point you begin to hear the actual industry here /none/ theres this faint buzzing and clicking sound as  you see some of these large wheels that are affixed to the outside of these large towers are  grinding you can see platforms rising up with the gears turning and on them you can see numerous  gnomes male and female in the process of what looks to be building materials lifted onto higher  levels you could see some of these war machines that are being developed and designed here  midconstruction you get the sense that with the call of war theyre probably put into high gear  /none/ in developing whatever siege weapons they can possibly muster in the short time frame and the  furnaces are going well  marisha and when you say war machines how do you mean  matt from what you can see from the distance you can see they have some largerwheeled  platforms that have boltthrowers which are large imagine a crossbow but on a massive  scale the giant metallic spear that gets flung from it at a really really powerful speed you  see three or four affixed to a single platform youre not sure what animal would be /none/ able to pull  that you also see siege towers 30 feet tall wheeled with a number of ladders and platforms  inside that are used to clamor up against fortresses you see one that looks almost like a  giant battering ram that is in the process of being constructed the interior metal rod is  currently resting on the ground next to it and theyre building an outer frame looking past on  the far end on the northern end you can see a huge cannon maybe about 15 feet across and about  three to four feet /none/ wide in the middle that one is on a platform the wheels are currently resting in  the side and theyre in the process of finishing the construction of the device make a perception check  sam yes  marisha 14  matt okay just beyond that on the northern side as you guys are riding past and you kind of  get as much height as you can beyond these towers and what was referred to earlier as the assembly  yard which is the area where all these war machines are being built you can see a roped /none/  section that is just pockmarked craters and scarred ground what you assume to be some sort of  a testing ground for whatever theyve been working on over the numerous decades or more theyve been  here youre not sure actually roll a history check because im curious to see how much you  know about this  marisha singsongy dont fuck me gil  sam yes  liam he did it  marisha fucked me pretty hard thats three can i use my mystical erudition to get an advantage  on history checks  matt ill allow it /none/ this time but usually you have to decide that before you make the roll its  not a lucky feat so  marisha deciding it now  matt but going forward  marisha and liam not much better  marisha at all nine  matt okay you havent learned that much about the history of hupperdook you know its been here  for a while  marisha this scarred potmarked line  matt this city its been here for quite some time so while youre not sure of how long that  field has been there you get the sense /none/ that this isnt a recent testing ground it probably has  been their general testing ground for any technology theyre developing  marisha okay so its not new okay  matt glancing about you see more crownsguard attire though now youre starting to get to more  gnomish crownsguard who are established there and on their backs as opposed to spears or shields at  the ready you see similar weapons to what some of the army moving eastward were carrying you see  long metal rods affixed with a wooden buttress at the end these strange firearms that have /none/ been  carefully relegated to certain individuals here are a little more in use here  sam are there any platform shoes glowsticks or pacifiers  matt make a perception check  sam all right 13  matt not yet  ashley are there any flowers that are even visible at this area  matt make a perception check  taliesin pink hearts yellow moons  ashley perception check  matt purple horseshoes  taliesin blue diamonds  matt red balloons  ashley 18  matt as you guys are clopping along you look down and most of the land /none/ here is fairly barren  the outskirts of this whether it be just the heavy amount of smoke and soot thats put out by  the industry there isnt a lot of grass what is here is pretty harsh scrubland you glance down  though and one of the small bushes does have a very uniquelooking white bud they havent opened  yet but theyre beautiful amongst this stark ground and you could reach down if you wanted to  ashley i reach down and i take it and put it in my book  matt you grab pluck a /none/ couple of them and put them in your book okay  taliesin therell probably be something siding closer to the waterfall maybe  ashley yeah ill get more  travis are the guards still within earshot  matt the ones you talked to earlier no you moved on from them but there are other  crownsguard in the area you can hear the heavy sounds of metal clanging and the occasional sparks  in the distance of some sort of welding process being done on some of the distant towers you can see  on the opposite side of the /dung/ southern side dozens and dozens of dark metallic warehouses and  buildings that are junctured by hallways there are small compounds that are focused on whatever  their specific businesses are in these designated delegated areas its weirdly almost drab and  dystopian in a visual perspective when you come to the base of the mountain here where you see  that large very steep staircase you were looking at there are the switchback pathways up there  but as you approach you hear this thud and looking up you can see these chains these big  heavy dark chains /none/ that are shifting and as it does you can see this platform begin to lower  from the city above heading in your direction in front of you at the base of the mountain you can  see there are a few other individuals that are sitting there waiting patiently you can see this  platform eventually comes down seems to be one of many means to make your way to the second part of  the city  sam will our whole cart fit on it  matt its a lift  laura hold the elevator  taliesin does /dung/ that seems safe to you  sam do we have to pay for it  laura it will be fun  matt all right as you approach you see there are four crownsguard one dwarven three gnomish  that are there waiting it you see the few figures that were waiting patiently they appear to be  welldressed human one halfelf wearing what looks to be reds and gold velvets they look  to be relatively welloff standing definitely out of place in this rather dark space they step onto  the lift and as you approach the guards put /none/ their hands out im sorry who are you  laura we are guests here  taliesin looking for lodgings for the night  matt lodgings well youll have to take the path upward this is designated for guests of  hupperdook  laura thats what we are were guests of hupperdook  matt guests of whom  laura hupperdook  travis guests of ophelia mardun  laura yes that one  matt make a deception check  travis 16  matt im sorry i dont recognize the name youll have to take the path  travis thats not our fault /none/ shes very important i would hate to keep us out of her good  graces i feel like the pull she has in this city should be more than enough to allow us to use the lift  matt i guarantee you sir ive never heard the name before in my life but there is always the path  travis well youll know her name after today i guarantee you that i hope you enjoy this post  for the rest of your evening  matt of course he takes a small pistol out from his side and aims it /none/ in the air and it fires  with a puff of smoke and the chains begin to lift  laura oh man come on i really want to be on it come on man let us get on man  taliesin i dont need that ride  sam what the hell was that thing he shot in the sky  laura it was a firecracker thats all  matt as you guys are frustratingly fuming over that notquiteaspositive experience a voice  from around behind you goes well now you look like youre not from around here is that true /none/  you turn and glance behind you and you can see through a surly grin and a curly mop of  brownishred hair a female gnome in her young adult years wearing simple clothes some leather  gloves she has dangling around her neck a set of eye protectors shes rubbing a little bit of soot  from her chin so you couldnt take the lift  laura well we could have if this guy he would have listened to us because we are really  important people  matt are you  travis no were not  matt see /none/ thats going to get you far here honesty  marisha selfdeprecation oh honesty  matt well probably both depending on the time of day so who are you if i might ask  laura were the mighty nein  taliesin travelers passing through to somewhere else  matt so youre not from around here i like that what brings you to hupperdook  laura we thought the name was funny  sam that is accurate  matt her brow furrows and a smile curls even wider across her face youre not wrong youre  not wrong well i happen to /none/ be a local looking for a way to kick off some boredom mind me  showing you around  travis i dont know whats your name  matt my name rissa pleasure to meet you mr  travis fjord  matt fjord mayhaps we be getting in some trouble too  marisha i hear you people like to get in trouble here at hupperdook  liam especially at night  matt we got about two hours  marisha thats like 400 wow amazing  matt well at this time itll probably be about dusk  marisha thats like 800 crazy /tavern/  taliesin we need to find a place to store our stuff and hopefully find an inn for the night first  matt theres a few inns to pick from i can take you around here ill lead you up the walkway  follow me  sam shes nice why lets kill her  marisha do we have this tourism look to us  sam for sure we do  laura we might as well be wearing fanny packs all of us  marisha we should get some fanny packs  laura like an amazing fanny haversack  marisha oh /none/ my god you dont know whats in there keep pulling stuff out  matt you guys begin to make your way up the switchback path up the mountainside towards the  upper edge of the shelf along that way your new friend rissa jumps up into the cart with you  she says i get the sense you dont know much about us here  marisha how much  matt oh no charge or buy me a round or five and well call it even  marisha what do you want  laura im going to keep an eye on /none/ her because i think shes going to try to steal some of our stuff  matt okay thats all i ask maybe help me fuck with a friend or two  marisha what  travis just say yes  sam shes just like us  travis were visitors here  marisha she just asked to fuck with a friend yes  laura beau you make really bad first impressions too shes basically you  marisha thats true  matt she looks to beau and is like yeah  marisha i nod back hmm yeah  matt anyway dont worry i /none/ know the place is a bit droll but once the suns down it gets  interesting  liam during all of that yammering on the way up i look over at yasha and sigh out  ashley yeah a little crazy  liam thats it  laura are you saying you are crazy i mean you did that in front of everybody are we having an  agreement  liam whispering i am crazy  laura oh i can see that about you  matt anyway things are a bit busy around here theyre busy most of the time general /none/ workday  here is about ten to 12 hours no weekends no breaks like the rest of you lazy and lackadaisical folk  taliesin private contractors  matt fair enough give you a quick tour of the place should give us right about time to get some drinks  taliesin drinks is a great idea  matt as you make your way up the mountain making small chatter eventually you come to the  outskirts of the idleworks shelf here encompassing the outer ring of this elevated shelf  of the silberquel ridge is a lively district of taverns inns /town/ merchants open pavilions that are  currently empty it looks like the place is pretty much perpetually decorated for some sort of an  event or a festival but its in disuse at the moment it is empty everyone you see in the  street theres nobody taking a walk everyone is rushing from one place to another or shouting  commands theres a general air of busyness and intent in each person you see as you guys  leisurely stroll through every now and then you get this sideeye of and they continue on past  a majority of /none/ the people here are gnomish probably 80 percent of the people you see in the  immediate vicinity at any point in time are of gnomish heritage only offset by the occasional  dwarf and some human halfelf thats as much as youve seen in your path here so far  liam do we as a much taller united colors of benetton pack draw a lot of attention as we walk through  matt i mean you do as you do you are a very colorful ensemble whenever you enter any sort of  new establishment  taliesin have we /town/ seen another tiefling since hitting the city  matt not yet no but to be fair most of the streets are empty unless its people going from  business to business its an interesting feel its almost like the town is a ghost town where  its dead outside of those that are in the process of making errands or doing runs  laura is it sooty up here too  matt a little bit but not as bad as below at this point your friend rissa is pointing out in  different directions and goes all right then thats /none/ over that way this is the center of  hupperdook culture here on the shelf where most of the folks come to unwind beyond that you can  see whats called the silver falls pointing over there thats the core of where most of the  residents live sleep make their families amongst the small towers you can see and from  this point you can now see those strange fingerlike protrusions that were guarded around  the waterfall are very condensed thin and tall metallic towers that have balconies and little  windows  marisha oh my god its /none/ a condo its a condo complex  matt theyre three stories maybe four stories at most a lot of them look like theyre offkilter  it looks not safe though they probably are its a very unique living situation you havent  encountered with any other people in the empire and beyond glancing up you can see there  are a few folks that are out there in the process of laying some rugs out and hanging them over the  side one woman up there is throwing some seeds to some birds that float by and start eating off /none/ the  edge there  liam rissa you mentioned culture are there any libraries here in hupperdook  matt im sure there is not anything ive bothered with though not much of a reader my  father well he might know but you dont want to talk to him  marisha where do the best parties happen  matt just wait be patient be patient  laura do you live on a high floor or a low floor  matt i choose to live on a low floor  laura less stairs  matt yeah gets warmer up top anyway /none/ dont want that  liam the walkups are tough  matt youre telling me want my quads to be ready in case i need to go into a sprint run for  my life you know  laura do you build the machines down there  matt i used to occasionally  liam what do you do now  matt i supervise  marisha supervise what  matt youre being a bit nosy here not going to lie i know we just met and im helping showing  you around but  marisha you offered though  matt i offered /none/ to tell you about the city not about myself  marisha okay  liam well we are a traveling group of hired guns who can get shit done we are a varied group of  people some of us learn and some of us are good at smashing skulls we would do any kind of work  if it were presented to us thats who we are were a motley group of assholes  matt i think youll fit in quite well around here  marisha did you get fired  travis oh my god  marisha what i just /none/ want to know  liam i was trying to defuse  marisha yeah you gave her information so maybe shell give us some did you get fired  suspended  matt i havent found a vocation that fits my personality tried some things wasnt my thing  marisha undecided major i like it  sam where should we stay tonight  matt well theres a few different places are you looking for a quiet spot to sleep or are you  looking for a wild place to not sleep  sam beau is looking for a wild place to not /tavern/ sleep  matt blushing tankard it is  sam gushing tankard  all blushing tankard  matt at this point the oranges and reds of sundown have taken the sky and you hear this pop sound  sam what was that  taliesin wait for it  matt you look up and you can see splashes of light in the sky above you faint fireworks start  going off  marisha what  sam are the dodgers playing  matt you start hearing shouts voices echoing from the city from the towers from behind you  along the shelf all /town/ these steam whistles start going off down below echoing from below the  streets suddenly come to life as people begin to rush out of buildings taking off their aprons  taking off their gloves setting off whatever their work attire is and rushing off to home to  unwind there is a rush of energy and you begin to realize beau wasnt kidding  laura this is a party town  marisha this citys awesome  matt they work hard and at night they play hard  taliesin youve brought us to florida  matt and thats where were /town/ going to finish tonights episode  cheering  liam steampunk burning man  marisha singing orlando orlando  sam fourth street in austin  matt oh
