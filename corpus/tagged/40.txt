town	 announcement  matt fantastic well cool guys then lets go ahead and get this show on the road so last we  left off vox machina having to traverse the world in search of artifacts known as the vestiges  of divergence ancient items of power used in massivescale warfare in ancient moments of  history they had acquired one from a sunken temple of the champion of the raven queen taking  the life and thankfully not permanently of vexahlia over here the party then retrieved  their first artifact and made their way towards the pyrah tribe of 
none	 the ashari druids the fire  guardians of the gate to the elemental plane of fire which apparently thordak the cinder king  the great red dragon that helms the chroma conclave that just tore through all of the  civilization of taldorei emerged from  marisha apparently  matt apparently by that i mean confirmed universally tore through you guys went there  found a surviving faction of the pyrah tribe including cerkonos their headmaster as well as a  few members of your tribe the air ashari keyleth and your father you went towards the  remnants of 
none	 the cindergrove ran into an ally a strange bluescaled dragonborn by the name of gern  blanston master of necromancy and candlemaking and combining the two for interesting effect you  fought your way through the cindergrove tearing through elementals encasing efreets in hamster  balls and holding them aloft for extended periods of time worked out well and then managed to seal  the gate with the help of the druidic tribes there gern and the intrepid adventurers of vox  machina after which you went to spend the evening there on the mountainside to rest before  continuing 
none	 your journey to wherever that next step may be so the rest of you are beaten bruised  and winded over the previous series of battles and the accomplishment you achieved here at the top  of the caldera of this mountain the erupting seismic energies and molten rock that once spewed  from the center of this rift have calmed and the gate once again has been sealed to its dormant  controllable and watchable size you guys are free to make camp wherever youd like  laura we already rested though  matt not yet youre about to 
none	 set up rest there are sections as youre walking out of the  cindergrove that you can see members of the pyrah tribe are pulling up stillfunctional pieces of  huts and tents and things that were destroyed when thordak tore through the rift and theyre  beginning to reassemble a place to stay for the evening for themselves so if you wish to stay  among the pyrah tribe for the evening it seems to be at least a relatively safe bet  laura what do you think keyleth i mean its your family  marisha thats up to 
none	 you guys i dont think i can transport us out of here until we sleep  taliesin i have no problem sleeping here this evening  laura im rather winded actually  taliesin yes  travis what are all the tents and houses made of anyway  matt most of them are made of pieces of stone the actual blackened grey rock of this mountain  elements of it have been fused together with bits of glass to forge these thick very sturdy walls  when they arent being torn through by a colossal red dragon  travis scoffs whatever 
none	  matt so theyre being brought back up druids are using what remains of their powers from the fight  today to assemble more walls of stone and theyre basically creating ramshackle living spaces using  their magic  marisha im going to go ahead and assist them because i didnt use any 5thlevel spells  matt all right so you begin throwing up some stone walls to help build a small shelter for the  evening the rest  laura is gern completely out of the picture have we lost sight of him  matt youve lost sight of 
none	 gern gern went back into the cindergrove and began essentially  guttersniping what pieces of red dragon scales he could locate in the vicinity he has not been seen  since that moment who knows to where he wandered  sam keyleth if i may  marisha yes scanlan  laura you said that so weird  sam thats how its spelled keyleth  marisha so regal of you scanlan  sam are your people comfortable in these little huts and stuff are we going to be safe tonight  because i could assist us with slightly better shelter  
none	 laura like how what do you mean  sam with my magical dalliances  travis is that another name for your penis  sam it is  laura are you going to poop us a bed  sam i could poop us a bed are we okay here safely or should i get us something special  taliesin with your dalliance  sam with my dalliance  taliesin i think your penis may have more names than i do im kind of horrified  travis yeah i want a house from your balls and bits  marisha i mean my 
none	 people have lived here for thousands of years  sam yes but their shelters are destroyed now so  marisha sure i mean generally were safe as long as dragons arent smashing through the  village but i mean if you have an alternative  sam i have an alternative i could do a bit of dalliancing  marisha you know youve talked about it so much now scanlan  taliesin is this going to be selfdalliance or are you going to need a partner  or two  laura i know are we just going to watch you diddle 
none	 yourself lets have it  travis mushroomstamp the land lets go  sam no no so i will take a minute and cast mordenkainens magnificent mansion  taliesin i am so proud of you i am so proud of you  matt okay so you guys watch as scanlan rummages through some of his side pouches and belongings  pulls out a few elements a small doorway carved from ivory he pulls out a piece of polished  marble a tiny silver spoon and puts them on the ground in front of him closes his eyes for a  second 
none	  sam can i enchant it with a little song or something  matt yes you may  sam so ill sing singing its a sick house its mighty mighty its letting it all hang  thats it  matt you guys are mildly confused but as he picks up the items you can see the door sets off  this small spark of white energy that glistens in the air hovers and then creates a somewhat  shimmering doorway just standing in the center of the space in front of you  laura what  sam would you like 
none	 to come into my place its a little modest shack that ive been working on  laura is this a teleport sort of  travis its a door  marisha is this a joke  taliesin theres nothing on the other side of it is there  sam no no its a place where we can rest for the evening totally safe and comfortable its on  a slightly different plane from ours so nothing can actually hurt us there or get to us  laura is it that fire plane where we just theres no dragons in that plane 
none	  sam i havent checked in a while actually this is my first time doing this  travis we should send somebody ahead first to check vax are you up to the bit  liam am i up to what what was that grog  sam its totally safe dont worry dont worry  liam as long as youre not going to whip out the cube then lead the way  sam how many people can fit in there its pretty big  matt any creature you designate when you cast the spell to enter so you could say the 
none	 entire pyrah  tribe if you wanted  laura what  sam everybody  matt everybody in the group or the pyrah  sam how many are there  matt here theres close to 35 including the zephrah  laura wait could you technically do this with any refugees i mean where do they go when you  make the door go away  sam this is my place all right i dont want any riffraff in there listen theres a guest list  theres a guy at the door  taliesin i can solve this really quickly are any 
none	 of the pyrah tribe hot  laura like attractive  taliesin attractive  laura theyre all hot  matt through the soot and ash and the rather somber atmosphere here that paints them as a  people that are the survivors of a horrible calamity beyond that theres probably a few that  youd consider attractive sure if youre that kind of person  taliesin that one over there was looking at you i saw her wink at you earlier  sam oh really  taliesin you should impress her  sam the one with her face just sheared off 
none	  taliesin yeah why not  sam all right not really my type i like fullfaced people but ill take it ill take my  chance  taliesin i think thats big of you  laura so terrible  sam you know if theres anyone from your immediate family that youd like to give lodging  to tonight okay well take them all well take them all in well take them all in  marisha sure do you want to tell them it is your humble abode  sam ashari people  marisha all right  matt you see some 
none	 of them stop and drop the rocks theyre currently holding and building some of  these small shelters  sam dont worry about your shelter for tonight let scanlan shorthalt take care of you in every  way shape and form imaginable come with me through this weird magic door into another plane  believe me its going to be okay  matt they all look at each other with a strange glance and continue building their current  shelters  laura why the fuck not and i walk on through  matt okay you open the door and as 
dung	 you grab it it is a solid door and the handle spins you look  inside and within you see an incredibly lush foyer to a grand mansion a 25 30foot ceiling  made of marble and dark woods you see a twopart staircase that splits off onto a secondtier  floor you hear soft music playing in the distance and immediately you see two somewhat  ethereal servants come down dressed as a butler and a maid they come down with an echoing voice  that say how might we be of service  laura what the fuck  
none	 sam hi i step in after her yes ive made some changes to the place living quarters are  upstairs theres a kitchen parlor game room over there billiards all sorts of stuff we have  a music room there are a hundred attendants who can wait on us ive assigned some of them  specific jobs five are going to play music for us wherever we want especially during our meals  matt let me take your things master  sam oh yes yes here  travis i come inside and i see the ethereal things im like ghosts 
none	 and i take craven edge  and i swing at the ethereal sumbitch  sam are you attacking my attendants  travis no the ghosts in your house  sam theyre my people  travis what  matt by the time you go to stop him three of the servants that have grabbed a few of your  belongings and been carrying away are swung at craven edge passing through and their energy  dispersing and their contents of whatever theyre carrying drop and clink to the ground  laura no  sam jesus christ  travis thank god im 
none	 here  sam grog grog easy easy theyre not ghosts theyre not ghosts they are supernatural  spirits some would say ghosts that are good they serve us they serve me  laura wait do you pay them or do they just work for you  sam theyre slave ghosts  laura this is terrible scanlan  sam well no they like it for some reason  laura are you sure  sam i can command them to do literally anything and they like it  laura have you asked them  sam watch this watch this i call one 
none	 over you there you there  matt this maid comes over a plumper older woman no feet just drifting along with this path of  mist behind her yes master  sam can you please braid my chest hair  matt but of course master  sam do you like this job  matt it is my purpose master  sam see this is what im telling you  laura your purpose do you enjoy your purpose  matt what does one but enjoy their purpose in life and continues braiding his chest hair  these tiny little hairs doing 
none	 a very good job its not very long but sure enough there is a  pattern  laura wow  sam thank you youre dismissed back to the music room  matt of course master  laura do you tip them  sam you can tip me ill pass it out later  laura i believe you  travis hey you there you ghostie do you have any ale in this establishment  matt but of course sir we have an entire winery as part of the mansion  laura what in the fuck is this place how are you 
none	 doing this  travis bring your most expensive frosty glass of ale  matt all right  liam i pull scanlan over to the side have you always been able to do this have  you been holding out on us man  sam it never occurred to me to do this before for some reason  travis you shouldnt be burt reynolds you should be hugh hefner from now on  sam no this is a skill that i recently acquired i would not hold out on you this is a new skill  that ive just learned and 
tavern	 im still making improvements to the house youll see that our  dining room has a portrait of myself in it not the one that i had commissioned but one that i  had envisioned before its just me in a smoking jacket standing in front of a fireplace with me in  a smoking jacket above it stephen colbertstyle  travis really  sam and we all have our own separate rooms all of the beds are circular they all have a mirror  over them  travis oh my god its graceland  sam mine is a waterbed 
none	 so be careful  laura so wait you built this entire castle so how do we know that you havent installed creepy  spy things into our rooms scanlan  marisha yeah little peep holes  laura i dont trust you  sam on we go to the rest of it  travis im waiting on my beer  taliesin ive got a great idea lets get some beer lets take a rest and in the morning we can  go to the game room get some dice and some paper  travis a game within a game the inception 
none	 bass note  taliesin its called meta and dragons were just going to see how deep it goes  marisha keyleth just gets a nosebleed for no reason shes not sure why  taliesin had to get that out of my system  matt an everspinning top on the banister at this point grog you can see that the servant you  had sent off comes up with a very large somewhat spectral flagon that upon handing it to you  turns into a solid metallic form and inside  travis holy shit  matt  a very very finely 
none	 chilled very nicesmelling wine  travis i put my hand up for a highfive  matt it makes contact  travis it does  matt a little cushy but it does make contact yes  travis wait these servants will do whatever you want to do  laura that is terrible its a terrible path youre going down right now i am uncomfortable  with this  sam i am way ahead of you grog im way ahead of you as i said there are 100 servants here 50 of  them are assigned to me and my own personal 
none	 service the rest are available to you in whatever  capacity youd like them  travis this is going to be the best night ever  marisha let me go try and gather the rest of the ashari  laura so uncomfortable right now  marisha can i get a plate of food from one of the ghosts as proof  travis its about to get caligula up in this bitch  matt the servants gather up a platter of food piling up grapes and meats and cured ham  marisha i just pop out of the door and address 
dung	 the people  matt as soon as you pop out of the door it all turns to smoke and dissipates  marisha aw son of a hey guys hey its okay its actually really nice its been rough why  dont we all take a night off and everyone come in and get some food take a night off  laura scanlan where are we staying wheres our rooms  sam rooms are all upstairs theres individual rooms for all of us mine is at the end of the  hallway and is slightly bigger than the rest you will 
tavern	 find comfortable beds and things in every  room the two rooms next to mine are reserved  laura for  sam one is for pike the other across the hallway is for kaylie just in case she ever drops by  laura thats really sweet  taliesin weird but sweet  sam dont worry its not weird  taliesin oh its weird  sam keeping her close to my heart  laura its superduper weird its really weird  sam its not superduper fine fine forget it when you have a daughter you can worry about her  as 
none	 much as i do  matt at this point keyleth returns with a few straggler pyrah tribal members that come in  looking about surprised bewildered and some of them a little freaked out by this transdimensional  space they just stepped into tardisstyle servants come up and start helping them some of  them are still clutching the rocks they were building as they pass it off and start making  their way out to various rooms to inspect the mansion a few stay back to continue what they  were already building ensuring future establishments to sleep once 
none	 you guys have left  so yeah you guys are welcome to rest for the evening if youd like  laura is the door protected can anybody come in or is it only if you invite them  sam only invited  laura this is the best fucking mansion ever how i mean what  travis how many times can you do this  sam once a day but thats all well need right  travis shit yeah wait wait wait so if we were in a fight and things went really south  sam we could take a break 
none	  laura gasps no but they could run away its not like time freezes  sam it does take a while to cast  matt it takes a minute so yeah  sam it takes a minute to cast  marisha so it cant be the middle of a battle sure  liam is there anything else you can do that you havent can you make an army of unicorns or a  giant in a dancing dress or is this the extent of what you can do  sam id like to keep a few secrets if you dont 
none	 mind  travis can you make fart sounds with your armpits  sam yes i can bend my thumb all the way back  laura i pull out my crystal and i call upon the great power of trinket i choose you  matt with a flash of deep blue and black light trinket emerges bear noises  laura we have a mansion you built a trinket room  sam you know what i totally forgot to build trinket a place to sleep  laura thats okay hell stay in kaylies room for the time being and then  sam

none	 dont know  matt you guys walk out of the foyer into the main hallway and at the end to the left you see a  doorway appear where there wasnt one before it opens up on its own and as you walk you can see  stairs that lead down and into a basement chamber that has a sand pit surrounded by brick there are  a series of wooden training dummies and various training accoutrements there are chains hanging  from the ceiling for lifting and climbing exercises there is a basic set of weapons against  the 
none	 weapon rack and a basic set of armor on the other set  sam muscleups  travis rope climbs  taliesin are we really about to pretend to do crossfit is that a thing thats actually about to  happen  sam is there a big thing that says wod on it  travis wizard of the day  laura the minute we get downstairs i start pawing into the bag of holding  travis what are you doing  laura i just need to grunts  a phone dings  sam ooh how did you do that  travis

none	 were going to train i thought we were going to fight  laura yes well trinket actually wanted some training with his cannonball if you will stand  still so he can run into you a few times that would be swell  travis i feel like theres a problem with this idea but im not sure what it is so i do it  matt okay trinket comes along with you and in a very confused manner attempts to train with you  for a short time its been a while since you wrestled a bear so its kind 
none	 of fun at times  laura its fun right  travis look i know i usually hit back but apparently your mum thinks you can cannonball into  me so give it a go  laura go ahead and try trinket  matt trinket backs up bear growling looks over at you again like are you sure across the sand  flooring into a giant rolling attack towards you  travis oh fuck  matt that is going to be whats trinkets attack bonus  laura oh god youre really doing it  travis yes  laura yes thats the 
none	 point of this to get trinket to run into you is the point his attack  bonus is plus eight  matt plus eight thats a 23 to hit  travis yeah that hits  matt you go ahead and take seven points of bludgeoning damage  laura and youre knocked prone  matt go ahead and make a strength saving throw  travis laughing okay 26  matt so trinket rams into you and you hold firm and flex conversely the giant bear bounces off  stumbles back onto trinkets butt  travis that was pretty good i liked 
none	 it a lot  matt licks you right along the face beard cowlicks up a little bit  travis i think this might be a good look for me how do i get it to stay  laura while all that is going on i have a broom in my hand  matt you do  travis i start climbing all over the walls  laura i put it between my legs and try to sit on it  matt all right  sam weirdly im doing the same thing upstairs  laughter  travis is one of your servants

none	 oh no  taliesin its a number  sam 14  matt 14 okay looking over the broom you can tell its enchanted there are runes along the  sides of the broom you do gather from the nature of the enchantment that it is an item that  requires a spoken phrase from the wielder to initiate its magic short of an identify spell  you would probably have to guess if you know the identify spell that would be a way for you to  sam i dont can i examine it to see if theres any markings 
none	 any hidden anything on it  matt make an intelligence check or you know what this would be specifically investigation  investigation check  sam investigation 21  matt you do notice that many of the runes intricately carved on the side of the broom are  theyre part of the enchantment however there is a certain phrase that is not part of the  enchantment its scrawled into and very cleverly hidden amongst the broom it is not common what  languages do you know  sam common gnome pig latin  matt it is not a language you 
none	 recognize  laura i speak elvish draconic undercommon  sam you dont see the words though  laura but you saw it  sam theres some words here that might be a clue to the code word basically we need to find the  code word what do we know about gern  laura well i tried fatty arbuckle i thought maybe that was something  sam did you try the others coral carol  laura coral carol  sam you probably need to hold it  laura what was the oh coral carol i dont remember the other ones

none	 language which is one of the oldest  languages in civilization it spells out phonetically the word for candle  laura thats smart hacking spit  matt at which point the broom jumps up in your hands and almost lifts you off the bed for a  second and you catch it and hold it back down  laura singing something has changed within me oh my god oh my god scanlan  sam weirdly you are not the first floating chick ive had in my bed but that is amazing youre  flying  laura i hug him i 
none	 hug him as hard as ive ever hugged scanlan i love you so much youre my  favorite person in the entire universe right now i owe you  sam nope you owe me nothing thats what friends are for  laura i love you  sam i shake her little elf hand  matt its a pretty big elf hand compared to your tiny gnome hand  sam okay  laura i sit on it how high are the ceilings in here  matt how high are the ceilings in your room  sam as high as they can 
none	 be on the top floor  matt for this room because it is an extradimensional space this room is probably a  good 50 feet high high ceilings with drapery its so garish  laura can i sit sidesaddle on it  matt yeah  laura hacking spit i dont remember how i said it before  sam youre going to have to remember that now  matt better write that down hacking spit  laura why didnt i choose something more fun to say  matt welcome to dd as the words emit from your mouth the broom takes 
none	 off and you have to aim it  a bit you start going around in circles slowly rising up towards the roof of the room  laura yay this is awesome im really high  sam i instruct the band to start playing flight of the bumblebee  matt whistling  laura oh my gosh can i take my hands off  matt you do and you start going whoa go ahead and make a dexterity check  laura oh my god i probably should have been lower to the ground when i said that okay thats  fine oh 
none	 im still exhausted  matt yep  sam oh shit  laura 20  matt thats fine youre fine a really bad roll might have had a circumstance but you manage to  catch yourself on the broom in time and okay youre getting the hang of it its still not  something youre used to but its fine  laura can i point it down towards the ground and get lower  matt you do and you take a few minutes to figure out the pitch and wobble of it and its less of a  directional flight more 
none	 than it is a combination of how you hold the front of the broom and  concentrate on its direction but nevertheless a few moments pass and you get the hang of it  laura oh my god this is the best day of my entire life  sam you look great up there  laura thank you thank you  sam but you should not have stolen that  laura oh i know i know its terrible  sam he was our friend he helped us  laura how bad of a person am i im a horrible person 
none	  sam we should do something to repay the debt  laura well i tried i was going to give him a lot of dragon scales and he wandered away  sam we cant possibly find him now  laura well how do i help him because i feel terrible  sam if we cant help him youre going to have to help someone else to make up for the lost karma  laura i will help as many people as i can while im flying through the air  sam perhaps i will pick someone for you to help 
none	 someday to repay us both  laura i think thats a deal scanlan  sam all right i will mark that down  laura what are you like a hag now i sit on it and i open the door and i fly through the  doorway  matt she drifts out of the room the door slam shuts behind her  marisha youre going to be one of those segway assholes now  travis yes totally  matt you lean back in your bed on your fine black silken sheets with flight of the bumblebees  still blaring by 
none	 the fireplace  sam all right guys it didnt work you can go  matt they all get up the music stops and they all slowly drift out of the room one by one  fireplace still crackling  sam its nice in here  taliesin im sitting wherever theres a lounge of any kind im working in the sketchbook working  on things  matt not a worry  marisha ill be reading my alchemy book because i have had so little time to catch up on my  reading  taliesin we never talk anymore do we  
none	 marisha we never do  taliesin mmm  laura im so happy its the best  matt so good  laura im going to try to sleep its going to be really really hard because im so excited but i  really need to get some rest  marisha did you feed the dog  taliesin today i dont know  matt so anyone want to do anything else you going to go rest for the evening  travis i rest  taliesin im good  matt all right you all eventually find your ways to your rooms happy and 
none	 comfortable in the fact  that no one has to take watch for this night as you all get to bed a few hours into the evening  keyleth you are just starting to doze off when you hear a knock at the door  marisha gasps awake scanlan  matt you open the door  marisha on my door  matt on your door  marisha who is it  matt keyleth it is cerkonos please open up i wish to speak with you  marisha i open the door  matt okay cerkonos comes in the first thing 
none	 you notice previously you had seen what was his  burnedoff arm at the shoulder you can now see the flesh is extended and is currently very slowly  in the process of regenerating his lost arm and it catches you offguard for a moment and he puts  his hand up and says sorry it is not very presentable and he still keeps his hand over it  slightly embarrassed by the midregenerative state of it im sorry to have disturbed you i come as  unease has taken my mind and he enters the room and closes the 
none	 door behind him may we sit  marisha of course please cerkonos  matt he goes over and takes one of the nearby chairs and sets it down places one across from  him for you to sit gestures with his one arm sits down i would not speak with those i do not  trust and i have seen your purity of soul keyleth so i come to you with these concerns  his eyes trail off for a moment in the distance and he gathers his thoughts and his words four  years ago a young woman came 
none	 to pyrah for redemption a lost girl cast out and wishing for  acceptance we as we do with outcasts took her in taught her and in time called her one of our  own one of the pyrah in recent months she began to grow distant taking to staying in the  cindergrove unattended for days at a time one afternoon the mountain moved angry with shifting  fires we felt a disturbance in the gate and when we went to investigate there she was commanding  powers we did not know she had  marisha what kind of 
none	 powers beyond those of druidic nature  matt these were the magics taken by man who defied the gods these were the purest of ancient arcane  threads we watched as she reached out and tore open the gate she laughed as we called out to  stop but something terrible emerged from that wounded sky  marisha thordak  matt this dragon you speak of yes i defended all that i could but the power was too great and  unconsciousness took me i awoke to my people in tatters the fires untethered and this terrible  girl gone 
none	 it is both embarrassing and greatly alarming that we could be infiltrated by such an  entity that blame falls on me as the headmaster for not seeing this earlier  marisha you acted within the good nature of our people theres nothing wrong with that how old  was this girl when she came to you and how old is she now  matt when she came to us she couldnt be more than 15  marisha so shes 19 20  matt perhaps she did not seem to blossom into womanhood as many do we considered her more 
none	 of a  runt of her litter if you will  marisha and what was her race  matt she seemed human  marisha she seemed human what do you mean  matt we take many forms as druids if she was indeed human at that age to command such power  i do not know her true nature  marisha what was her name  matt her name was raishan anyway i wish to tell you this because my heart is heavy with  guilt and i want you to know that even in places of comfort family be 
none	 careful keep those you  know you can trust close be mindful of those that promise aid when they have not proven themselves  if you have an instinct follow it  marisha are you referring to something in particular cerkonos  matt i just do not wish you to make the same mistake i did anyway i thank you for your  companions and you coming to our aid it shall not be forgotten  marisha i shall keep an ear open for the name raishan if i hear anything about her ill send word  matt should you 
none	 need the aid of the pyrah though we are not much at now come find me i  look forward for to you bringing zephrah together you will make a fine leader  marisha thank you cerkonos and im glad that youre still with us  matt kaitiaki keyleth  marisha kaitiaki cerkonos  matt cerkonos leaves  marisha and i start poring through my notes for the name raishan because keyleth believes she has  heard that name before as one of the dragons correct one of the white  laura whispering its the green one  marisha the 
none	 green one okay okay  matt that is true  marisha do i have any other reference would i know anything else about that  matt thats all you know is the name raishan was used when the conclave attacked emon  and it seemed the name belonged to the green dragon that initiated the assault where you guys were  marisha fucking bitch  matt so these thoughts echoing through your mind  taliesin streets will run green with revenge  marisha yes they will  matt you sleep but uneasily as all of these realizations swirl in your 
none	 head eventually sleep  takes you but it is not an easy sleep just enough to function barely vax as you yourself  have attempted to stave off sleep for many days pushing yourself to your limits it finally takes  its toll and you drift off into a deep deep slumber in that slumber you find yourself in  darkness echoes of a distant voice muffled as if underwater crash the darkness is shattered  into a thousand black feathers and you find yourself falling falling falling towards what  seems to be a tangled net of glowing threads 
none	 youre afraid you might impact at such a speed  but before you do you slow and come to a stop before this extremely prominent glowing weave  this infinite tapestry in all directions you are uncertain of the meaning of this moment when a  large cold hand reaches past your shoulder and grasps a thread right before your face this  singular glowing thread pulsing with light like a heartbeat you follow the arm over your shoulder  and glance up directly into the massive form of the raven queen porcelain face like a mask long  jetblack 
none	 hair her body encasing you like a physical cage your eyes follow the arm back to  the thread that she carries between her massive fingers she tugs it ever so gently and it  causes waves to ripple through the tapestry into infinity her voice fills your mind both calm but  cold this is you my champion you are fatetouched the choice is yours rebirth or  ruin maker or martyr conqueror tyrant or nothing she plucks the thread from the weave  snapping it you plummet into the hole left behind it falling faster and faster into 
dung	 the dark  losing control you turn around and see the raven queen disappearing into the distance growing  smaller and smaller until suddenly nothing  grog you fall into a deep snore heavy heavy snore after drinking the wine climbing up walls  youve had an exhausting day of  travis sleeping in the sand pit  matt okay you are face down  travis like a beach just snore  matt its great youve drooled into the sand and its clustered around your beard its  horrifying but in the middle of snoring this restful sleep also comes 
town	 into your mind and you  find yourself walking alone a long hallway into blinding light you have to cover your face its  so bright but you push forward because you know theres only one way to go you cannot see but  you can hear around you and sense the hallways ended and theres now space around you you  cannot see but you sense an arena gladiatorial in nature you can hear the distant whisper and  hum of crowds cheering  sam phillip phillip  matt you sense others around you closing in suddenly a voice 
dung	 everwhispering in your ear  says release me still blinded eyes closed on instinct you pull the cold dark blade from your  back and swing wide over and over again feeling the shuddering shock of each impact your strength  matched by the razorlike edge of your weapon cleaving down any who would approach the high of  adrenaline is incredible and you laugh aloud at the sheer thrill of your own power  travis laughs triumphantly  matt the light subsides and your vision returns you look to see hundreds of people dead at your  feet farmers 
none	 children you see pike motionless cast among the carnage you want to scream but  instead you laugh against your own judgment and intent like youre locked within yourself and  have no control and as you look up from the pile of corpses at your feet you see a towering figure  before you cast in furs and bone standing even a head and a halfs height above you is kevdak  looking down at you with pride the entire herd steps up beside him staring at you atop your  throne of corpses and the herd kneels kevdak 
none	 bows looking up at you smiling you you have  finally made me proud grog  you wake up gasp spittle and sand and grit mashed against your face who knows how long its  been but its been a while since youve had a dream let alone one like that  now as you all eventually come to in the morning having your evenings rest youve recovered your  hit points your spells all of the usual good stuff in a fantastic mansion maybe not the most  fantastic rest for some of you but a fantastic mansion you 
none	 all eventually find your way to the  breakfast nook which is as extravagant as you would imagine a scanlanbased  breakfast nook would be  taliesin green marble silver tiling sorry carry on  marisha crystal chandelier  sam waffle presses  matt theres a fantastic breakfast feast already prepared rows of servants along the walls waiting  eagerly to attend to you guys as you sit down pouring fresh juices it smells fantastic and  most of you look rested except for a handful  sam eat drink  laura i come skipping into the room for sure 
none	  taliesin good morning  sam youre looking delighted and delightful  laura what a beautiful day it is  marisha do you have wine and ale at the breakfast buffet  sam sure sure theres mimosas theres  marisha ill have a mimosa  taliesin youve never heard of breakfast beer  sam breakfast beer sure theres milk from a cow with a broken nose  laura oh that is so sad can you heal it can it be healed  sam itll be fine when we leave this place all these people die anyway  taliesin youre supposed 
none	 to churn the milk after it leaves the cow  laura wait scanlan can we store things here or does it all disappear as soon as we leave  sam i dont know  matt you havent tried it before  laura we should leave something inconsequential  sam well leave trinket and then well try it again and if trinkets still here well know  marisha schrodingers trinket  sam its just no  laura no  sam all right well leave the broom and see if its still here  laura no no no lets not  taliesin 
none	 what broom  sam oh vex is there something youd like to admit to the rest of the group theyll see you  use it sooner or later  matt you hear a voice go grunt trinkets over there face covered in breakfast food trying to  sit at one of the edges of the table like a person the actual bowing of the wooden bench that  trinkets on you hear the creaking as he moves around in it  laura thank you scanlan for making me feel so guess what i can fly aplus  taliesin how did 
none	 that happen  marisha i had a really weird night too what happened in your because i mean flight  laura did you have a weird night do you want to tell us about it  marisha no i want to hear about your night  taliesin i think you go first  marisha i want to learn how you fly  laura okay so i sort of kind of tricked gern im a terrible person  sam gern our friend  travis you swallowed that last part what did you say  laura i sort of kind of this 
dung	 is the worst took something that wasnt mine in a way i mean  i was holding on to it and then i slipped and it fell into the bag of holding  travis why is that bad  taliesin you stole from a candlemaker  laura i stole from a necromancer  taliesin slash candlemaker  laura yes no he was a nice guy  sam i think we should hear vaxs opinion of this  marisha vax i think you were a bad influence  liam i cant judge ive done my share in the past i thought 
none	 you were a little overly nice to him  taliesin i mean to be fair we did steal a carpet once  laura we did  sam did we steal that i thought it was just a  marisha we used that in an emergency  travis we commandeered it  laura we took it scanlan and we didnt tell allura  taliesin and then never gave it back  sam thats true  laura were terrible  liam i dont think any of us can judge you vexahlia but it does strike me as a little bit  odd 
none	 if nothing else  laura i know i know im afraid these rogue tendencies ive been learning from you brother  maybe rubbed off a little bit no i just i know i shouldnt have  travis i dont care  laura i wanted to return it right away and then he wandered off thats a lie i didnt want to  return it but i did want to pay him  travis i dont think you wanted to do that either  laura no i did i did i wanted to pay him but he wandered away and then 
none	 i didnt pay him and  now i have this broom that i stole and theres really no way to return it well i probably could  find him but i dont want to because now i can fly you guys  travis are you going to regift it  laura no im going to keep it  marisha what do you say percy i think its kind of funny  taliesin are you honestly asking my opinion you said what  laura actually percy do you know i know you can build things and make things wonderful  taliesin

none	 build a seat and then i can sit on it instead of trying to sit on this  tiny little stick  taliesin let me  sam tinker  taliesin tinker  marisha you know beyond it being an engineering issue it might be a greed issue first  laura really  marisha look  laura hows that mimosa treating you  marisha its phenomenal its been a long few weeks i dont care i dont care were never  going to see gern again i have so many other things to care about  sam oh no shes day

none	 to say no to her im perfectly content to let this go  travis it is pretty sweet flying around like that  laura its pretty wonderful  marisha its really cool  taliesin shes an adult deep levels of arrested development but an adult nonetheless  marisha i dont care about the broom  sam keyleth vex swore to me that she would only use it for good  laura thats right im not going to steal anything while im riding on it  taliesin where would you put it anyway you cant let go  marisha just dont

none	 not happen next time  laura i start eating while sitting on the broom  marisha all right i think shes listening to me  sam i think you broke through  marisha i think i did  taliesin i think youre learning to let people be people  marisha i dont care anymore  sam oh look look another round of chickens has just arrived for us to eat  marisha oh chicken  sam i dont know what breakfast is so i just keep commanding them to make chickens  matt so much chicken guys  laura where 
none	 should we head to  sam what is our next shoot i kept a todo list for us but i didnt bring it tonight  travis burps  sam oh i thought you were going to say something that was a belch  travis yeah  laura did you want to head back to actually keyleth you said something weird happened last  night for you as well  marisha yeah cerkonos stopped by  laura yeah i look at my brother all right cool keep going  marisha not as my elder he stopped by as my respected elder 
none	 do you all remember  the name raishan  taliesin yes  laura thats one of the dragons  marisha apparently shes our little infiltrator  laura what do you mean  marisha she came to the fire ashari she came to pyrah about four years ago and the ashari being  the adoptive people that we are they took her in  laura they adopted a dragon  marisha they adopted a dragon  laura how  taliesin do they think shes the one who sabotaged the rift  marisha they do they were unaware that she was a 
none	 dragon  sam does that make her the leader or something is that how all the dragons got through im still  not quite sure  taliesin it makes her the instigator at the very least  marisha it makes her fairly close to thordak it would seem apparently when she came to the fire  ashari she was about 15 years old and  sam as a dragon  taliesin visually  marisha as a human woman  laura so she was making it seem like she was 15  marisha she was making it seem like she was 
none	 15 and they started realizing that she possessed  powers far beyond anything that they had seen before and then these powers began to exceed  anything beyond our druidic capabilities and it would seem that they realized that too late  sam did they say anything about her goals or motivations her ambitions  marisha cerkonos said one day they woke up and the mountain was spewing fire and was angry with  lava and when he went to investigate it she was there ripping open the rift and that was when  everything happened when he came to 
none	 consciousness everything was destroyed so thats  all he saw and she was gone but we know where she went next  travis where  sam to emon  laura oh eventually  sam kill everybody  laura right totally that day the day  marisha i was trying to skip exposition i thought you guys could fill in the blanks  taliesin we thought you had new information beyond that and would maybe want to add it was  certainly set up that way  marisha thank you ill work on that next time  taliesin it was very 
none	 leading  laura okay well thats good to know  sam so perhaps we should inquire if you think this raishan  marisha raishan  sam has tried to pretend to be a human woman in any other place should we ask around or was it  just the one ruse here to gain entry for her companions  marisha im not sure  sam all right well dont trust anyone  marisha dont trust anyone  laura got it  matt servant rushes forward more chicken sir  sam keep it coming  matt right away  laura do 
none	 you guys have vegetables maybe any vegetables  matt vegetables sir  sam i forgot to tell them to make them sorry its all chicken  matt chicken it is  laura cool chicken and mimosas its my favorite breakfast  marisha and waffles  sam oh waffles too chicken and waffles thats right maybe someone else should be in charge of  the food next time we come here my tastes are a little  taliesin base  laura little  sam singular  marisha and one thing that this does confirm is that this has been a plan 
none	 thats been in the  process for a very very long time  sam no i just came up with the chicken this morning when i woke up  laura where are we going next you guys  sam grog had some brass knuckles to get was that a thing did we get those  travis no we havent gotten those yet but theres other things to explore  sam all right wait did we have to go make a trip to anyone elses homeland hows whitestone  laura we need to talk to a sphinx a sphinxs boyfriend

none	 to put that  off a bit  travis oh no i mean whenever its you know  laura so do you want to go now or do you want to maybe swing by somewhere  taliesin its either that or the library i imagine  travis you want to go to the library  taliesin i was just saying that its either that or the library  sam so its grogs herd or the sphinx to get something  laura well remember  sam on the way and then or tbd find something else to do i guess grogs 
none	 thing is the most  promising we know that theres knuckles there we know that theres people well know there  laura well its all actually around westruun right arent your people around westruun  travis you know they roam  laura so we have to find them  travis yeah  laura last time we ran into them wasnt it on the way to kraghammer  taliesin from westruun  marisha odessas mate is south of the frostweald  laura i think it was  travis was it  liam yeah it was on the way to kraghammer thats 
none	 right  sam is frostweald near kraghammer as well  laura the frostweald is  matt south of westruun  laura south of westruun yes  taliesin so lets make our way to westruun i suppose then  sam and thats in the direction of both grogs herd and the frostweald  laura potentially well grog would know  travis what  laura cool yes i think grog really wants to go  sam yeah we should probably go there  laura yeah  sam lets do that  matt your herd wanders all across the silvercut roadway that whole 
none	 area to the west of westruun  south of kraghammer east of emon that vicinity  travis they wander there  laura around there  travis yep  laura okay  travis but look i was thinking it might be a thing when we find them right so picture this  me and then a lot of other mes and theyre all really big and angry so if we want to do anything  else before that happens  sam you think theyll attack us but were with you youre our ally  travis yeah and im a super cool 
none	 awesome fun guy but we didnt really leave in the best terms  laura oh werent you  travis asskicked yeah all left for dead pretty much  marisha you know what grog its been a while why exactly were you beat up and kicked out of  your herd  travis right so i was a bit younger and we were wandering through the woods and we came upon this  little old bearded thing right and he was carrying groceries like food and stuff and  everybody was a little hammered from boozing and they were like hey 
none	 lets kill the little thing  and well string him up and see what his insides look like and normally im like yay ill wear  him as a hat but he looked really sweet and i felt bad so i said we shouldnt do that and  they didnt like that answer my uncle in particular he didnt like that so he made me  fight my cousin his son  laura and  travis that wasnt bad i handled that it was not a problem  marisha okay so they might have a grudge about that  travis 
none	 no theres no grudge they pretty much think im dead because after i whooped his sons  ass he whooped my ass  laura oh  travis yeah  taliesin we have a thing for that  sam we do  taliesin can i borrow your hat  sam of course you can borrow my hat  laura the hat of disguise  taliesin if you dont want to have an immediate confrontation with your family theres no  particular reason why they have to know youre alive yet at all  sam you could wear this hat might not 
none	 fit on your head you could maybe put it on one of your  knuckles  travis im not hiding from my herd  taliesin you were giving off the impression of one who is looking forward to putting something off  travis i was was i  taliesin you were youre not anymore as if youve been dared somehow  laura very big  sam if youre too scared to do it we can go elsewhere sorry i will never say that again  travis no im excited to go i want to go we should go you know 
none	 what we need is the wolf  laura the wolf  travis yeah we need  laura oh the wolf in whitestone  travis yeah dont they smell shit he could help us find them  laura well trinket can smell  marisha and i can also theoretically turn into a wolf to help us find things  travis i mean if you want to i dont know how long its been since hes seen a shewolf so you know  liam grog  marisha i was talking as in  travis i mean its very generous  liam just 
none	 out of curiosity we werent going to walk in and negotiate with your uncle hes not  going to give us these knuckles hes a proud owner of them yes  travis yep  liam and how many are in the herd roughly  travis whats a number bigger than five  laura six  travis yeah its like six  marisha you mean its like at least six or possibly more than six how fast actually is the  reproduction process of goliaths  taliesin are there more people in your herd or fingers on your hand  liam 
dung	 i hold up scanlans hands and then i hold up my hands behind them so that all 20 fingers are  waggling grog are there more than this many in your herd  travis yeah six  laura okay  taliesin hes counting hands not fingers  laura oh i hold up mine too  sam we all hold up our hands  laura how many hands is that  liam were doing rakshasa hands grog is there more of them than rakshasa hands  travis thats closer yeah its been a long time  marisha yeah this could be 
none	 bad this could be bad  taliesin we could attempt to steal them  laura steal from the goliaths that could work  marisha how easy is that  laura does he wear them all the time does he put them in a chest  travis i mean theyre pretty smart theyre like me  laura yeah youre right  liam i dont think its going to be pretty no matter what we do but i actually think trying to  steal them might be a better angle than going toetotoe with six goliaths i just did air quotes  
none	 laura if six is the right number  travis heres the thing though normally if you try and steal something or if you try and break  the rules and youre like keyleth and you get arrested every time arrested aint so bad they  dont really arrest you they like open you up and use you as an appetizer  laura as a hat  travis yeah that was my thing though so im a little nervous about that  liam we just have to pick the least terrible option right now  marisha well we need these vestiges 
none	 we cannot do anything without these vestiges  sam it seems to me that no matter where we go we are putting ourselves in peril  travis yep  sam so its really just a question of which peril do we want to face first  marisha and dont we theoretically need the vestiges before we go visit odessas boyfriend  sam i thought odessas boyfriend had a vestige  laura no he has locations of other vestiges  travis odessa osysa  matt osysa  marisha sorry  travis shit thats what i would call her odessa  laura 
none	 i feel like pike would want to come with us grog youre very dear to her  marisha but wasnt pike and her grandfather the reason  travis it was pikes grandfather yeah and plus shes a healer  taliesin at the very least lets make our way to westruun then lets get that far and see whats  marisha well remember westruun is under dragons right now  sam we can instantly transport anywhere  laura you know of trees outside of westruun  marisha i can but its under dragon reign in fact isnt that where raishan stopped 
none	 off  matt no the scrying that you saw was umbrasyl the black dragon that took up residence it  seems in gatshadow the mountain north of westruun at the base of the cloudkeep mountain range  laura and gatshadow is where grog got his scar right  matt yep thats where you guys initially that happened  travis all right fuck look if theres a lot of them and only a handful of us its not usually  customary to have two sides go at each other if we want those knuckles im pretty sure it might  have 
none	 to be one on one now i know i can totally take my uncle but i wouldnt mind if we found a  few extracredit items before we did that just in case i have the flu that morning or it burns when  i pee just something to take the edge off  sam so sphinx first  travis if thats what you want to do then yeah  sam say no more  marisha okay and did we also want to check out the cobalt reserve which was in westruun or did  allura already handle that and 
none	 were cool  laura allura i think handled that right you saw her  marisha she was there and it looked pretty trashed it looked like she grabbed a lot of the  last of the good things  sam all right lets go to the sphinx then wheres that the frostweald weve been there  laura yes we have been to the frostweald  sam do you remember any trees there  laura frostweald is where grog mugged down with the nymph right  liam allegedly  laura allegedly  sam well never know  travis grog does not 
none	 kiss and tell  laura yes you do  travis all the time  liam all the time all the time  marisha just not that one time that we want to actually know  sam lets go to the frostweald  laura lets do it  sam do you remember any trees  marisha do i remember any trees  matt at the time because you were not specifically paying attention to this ability of  yours there is no specific tree that has caught your attention you could attempt to make an  intelligence roll  marisha not 
none	 my strong suit a straight intelligence check nine  matt nine unfortunately you cant recall the specific location of any trees in the frostweald  its been a long time since then and you werent being conscious of it at the time  marisha its been a few years you guys  taliesin all trees look the same dont they  marisha after a while  taliesin say it all trees look the same  liam all right everybody hop on vexs broom  laura i mean we could try  marisha i could get us close or i could 
none	 scry and look for a tree  matt if you would like to yeah  marisha can i take time to do that  matt if you want to yeah the trees in the area that you would know that you recall there was  a there were trees based around the crossroads which is the middle point of the silvercut roadway  thats even further northwest and west of westruun theres the bramblewood forest which is  just north of westruun most of them would be further west from there those are the closest  marisha the closest destination 
none	 would the crossroads be good maybe get us to the  crossroads  sam or we could just go to westruun is westruun still there  laura westruuns under dragon rule theres an actual dragon on westruun  matt not on up in the mountain but watching down probably  marisha but theyve got wyverns policing right in westruun  matt you didnt notice in your scry  marisha im going to assume lets do the crossroads  laura lets do it lets do it lets do it  marisha we could theoretically run into your herd though  travis 
none	 yeah i mean i hope we do  laura yeah  marisha to the crossroads  matt okay so youre going to the crossroads the crossroads is about two days of travel northeast  of the frostweald about three days travel  marisha so i would be going northeast from the crossroads or if i wanted to go in the  bramblewood i would have to southwest to get to the frostweald  matt here we go this is the frostweald this is westruun this is the crossroads this is emon  this is kraghammer  laura oh shit  
none	 marisha wheres the bramble forest  matt its right here its by westruun the crossroads is over here you can totally take the  crossroads but itll be  laura go to the forest  marisha lets go to the forest lets go to the bramblewood forest  matt bramblewood forest okay thats fine  marisha theres got to be some big trees there i remember a few big trees i remember admiring a  few big trees in the bramblewood forest  matt because you spent a lot of time in westruun specifically you do recall various locations you 
none	  take a moment to concentrate on a few trees actually within westruun you recall there was one  that was near a playground where you had once interrogated a small child if they had seen  taliesin yeah i remember that  sam we spent a whole day in that park  matt yep you begin to cast the spell and you concentrate on that tree in the park theres no  connection to the tree you gather that the tree may not have survived the initial attack on  westruun however you do take a moment and you 
none	 do recall at the entrance to the bramblewood when  you guys were briefly attacked by that group of thieves that were pulling you off to the side  pretending to be a stranded caravan  marisha that was good  matt there was a series of rather large trees that marked the roadway there and you recall one  that had distinct markings and you do manage to find a point of concentration or connection there  marisha i guess it took me a moment to find signal okay all right were good  sam you need a signal 
none	 boost  marisha i think i got one  matt you complete the spell against one of the petrified trees on the outside of the cindergrove  the doorway opens up and you guys can see a thicket of bramblewood trees on the opposite side  you all rush through one after the other trinket jumping behind you all make it through and  youre now standing on the central pathway of the bramblewood further south youre probably about  an hour and a half foot travel before you exit the southern portion of the forest  marisha all right 
none	 sorry guys this is as close as i could get us  laura no this is great  sam and how far are we now a days travel two days travel you said  matt to the frostweald youre about a day and a half on horseback youre about a day under a  day on foot youre looking at about two days travel a little over two days travel  sam and laura ugh  matt thats a rapid pace  marisha mist form  travis or we go where  marisha we could be clouds  sam were 
none	 not very fast in mist form are we  laura no we are were super fast  sam are we  matt youre fast in mist form  marisha how long would it take to get us in mist form  matt it would be a little bit faster than a horse  sam like a day  marisha should we turn into clouds and go  sam i havent done this before is it freaky  laura i pop trinket back into his little crystal  sam is it super freaky  taliesin its so super freaky  sam 
none	 all right  laura percy what if instead of a seat what if it was like i was straddling it and there were  two little things like footholds  taliesin im sorry do you want to design this  laura no no its up to you its totally you  taliesin are you sure  laura i was just coming up with ideas to help you out  taliesin youre welcome to design this its just going to be much more expensive  laura no no its all you its all you  matt so keyleth what are you 
none	 doing are you doing the  marisha yeah im picking my spells because i havent done that yet but yeah well poof  matt so keyleth goes ahead and casts is it wind walk  marisha wind walk  matt all of you guys take a moment to transform into a mist form and you all begin to coast right  around the top of the trees making your way south to the back of the bramblewood as soon as you  exit the top of the trees you can see westruun ahead of you and there are a number 
none	 of  interesting things that catch your attention first and foremost you see halfway between the  treetops to the south end of the forest and the very north part of westruun there appears to be a  large green open field with thicker patches of grassland here and there there is a section that  is a grassless dirt mound that has as you start coasting over you can see what looks like spikes  of wood a couple of things that glimmer in the light as you pass over and what looks like large  grooves dug in 
none	 a haphazard pattern this patch is about 15 or 20 feet across and you see two people  bringing a cart away from it  laura can we mist down a little closer to get a better view of what it is  matt yeah these wispy peopleclouds wind  taliesin those clouds look like halfelves  matt no one seems to pay mind the two individuals that went away with the cart are a  little far from what you can see at this point but they both appear to be humanoid in no  particular rush but theyre 
none	 hauling this large cart away as you look you can see in this patch  of dirt the glimmers that you saw was a smattering of gold and silver coins that appear to  have been tossed into this pile it looks like there are pieces of wood that have been broken and  crushed in the giant grooves whos taking the intense look at this one right now okay so the  two of you i want you to roll investigation checks  taliesin 18  laura wow no 16 for me  matt you recognize and you get 
none	 a feel for it too because of your specialty in this you notice  that the giant grooves that tear into this are actually sweeping claw marks like something of a  large size and a very fast speed came down and has come down multiple times to snatch up  something that was placed in this location  laura oh this is where they make their offerings  taliesin this is where the offerings are made  laura thats good to know i have advantage on anything having to do with dragons  matt right which as youre seeing 
none	 this now yeah you would gather the information with him as  you did do you guys continue southward  marisha yeah  matt coasting on the outskirts of the city  laura its good to know that thats there though  travis we could set an ambush later  laura yeah  matt you guys begin to coast around the outside of westruun drifting up above as well this wispy  pattern of clouds you get a view of the external farmlands that dot the northnorthwestern side of  westruun a number of them appear to have been burned 
none	 not like forest fire or cataclysmic  meteorite like intentionally burned the crops are charred and black and theres a pattern to  how that was set a few farmhouses also appear to have burned as well but there are farmlands that  are also functional and you can see people tilling the land i want everyone to make a  perception check  travis a what  laura perception  travis 14  marisha 16  taliesin 18  sam three  laura 31  liam 22  matt okay so people above 20 would be the twins all 
none	 right so vex and vax you guys look over  these fields and two things you notice one each set of farmers that are working there is a  wellarmed individual on the outskirts of each of these farms that is intently watching them work  as youre paying attention to this one of them walks over and starts screaming at one and pushes  them over and then stands back and keeps guard you also notice that the outside of the city  there appears to be some sort of construct or battlements almost like another wall a very 
none	 thin  wall has been built around the various entrances to the city  laura theyve imprisoned the people we cant talk to each other  matt cant talk to each other no not in mist form  taliesin just vape at each other  travis do we keep going or do we somebody make a choice down or keep going  laura i dont know what good well do right now  marisha cant do anything right now  taliesin youre the only two that have noticed  matt its up to you guys do you guys want to 
none	 go investigate or do you want to keep going south  laura i mean how many guards are there around there  matt you only see two that are actually in the immediate farmland and theyre quite a walk away  from the actual city they dont appear to be on heavy lockdown  liam as wind ill pull in front of my sister and use windiness and wind hands and wind farts to put  up a stop sign with my hands and point down if thats possible in this form  matt yeah thats possible in the form 
none	 vex you see vax your brother stop in front of you put  his hands up and point downward with his hands  laura what do you want to do what do you want i noticed it too  taliesin i float on over to this  liam im going to go down and im going to motion for her to follow  taliesin all right going down  matt you guys all follow  taliesin ill solidify on the ground  sam im still thinking about what were those big gashes in the ground back there  matt yeah 
none	 it was really confusing to you all right you guys all drift down towards the ground  as you see vax begin to take on physical form on the outskirts  laura oh shit can we stealth as we come out of it i want to cast pass without a trace  immediately  matt okay are you going down to the burnt farmland or one of the healthy farms  laura can we go down in an area that theres shadow to where were hidden  matt there are a few of the fields that are more high crop 
none	 cornstyle stalks  laura somewhere that when we take form well be hidden  travis just you two right  laura i dont know  taliesin im going down too  travis you three  matt okay percy vax and vex all take a moment to revert back to their physical form  sam oh im reverting too im a follower  matt all right scanlan keyleth  marisha i guess so  travis wow were just going to make this super obvious huh there are dragons flying overhead  taliesin well weve landed  marisha were in a corn 
none	 field  travis yeah weve landed lets do it we all want to die  matt all right so all of you including grog or are you staying in your mist form  travis fuck it lets do it im changing  matt you all take a moment to revert to your physical form i would like everyone to make a  stealth check  laura and i cast pass without a trace so its extra ten  marisha ooh natural 19  travis hey 18  laura 32  liam 25  laura add ten  liam 35  
none	 taliesin 31  sam 29  marisha 36  sam were all good  travis 28  matt what did you get again  laura 32  taliesin you dont know were here anymore  matt whered the party go you all begin to weave your way through the various lines of highstalk  crop where are you heading are you heading in towards the city or are you heading  towards the farmers  laura we just want to sit here for a minute and talk about it can we just say so heres the  thing those guards 
none	 are attacking the farmers im pretty sure theyre using slave labor at this  point kind of like you scanlan slave labor to provide food for the city vax really wanted to  stop down but the thing is if we kill the guards and set the farmers free everybody in the city  might starve its a tough situation right now  taliesin or they might just send more guards once they know that ones been killed and then  kill everybody involved  laura im afraid right now i dont know what all we can do in this 
town	 town until we can defeat the  dragon which unfortunately is rather close  marisha its a bigger problem  taliesin we cant do anything for them right now until we actually know whats happening  matt as you guys are having this conversation you can see theres a slight rustle and a  farmer comes across carrying a small satchel as hes picking things off of one of the nearby areas  travis is he close to us  matt about 15 feet from you  marisha does he see us  matt he doesnt seem to notice you 
none	 guys  laura i mean we can tell him to hold out hope  taliesin maybe he knows whats going on  laura he could also be one of the assholes thats serving the dragon just like people in emon  travis i go clicks  matt the farmer turns gasps you now see him its a man in his late 40s early 50s gray beard  travis shh help me out shh  matt yeah  travis shh  laura act natural  travis keep picking  laura keep picking  matt he keeps picking  laura hey you 
none	 do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon  taliesin in the interest of the internet we should probably do stage whispers  laura do you like the dragon or do you not like the dragon  matt you can see theres some heavy bruising on his face and part of his cheek is swollen he  goes it would be hard around these parts to find someone who likes a dragon let alone that one  laura good  matt not the worst of the worries right now though  laura whats the worst  
none	 matt the ones who work for him  laura right so you have to provide food for everybody living in the city is that how that goes  matt every one of them otherwise they just go ahead and steal from whoevers nearby isnt a  caravan thats made their way past westruun in the past week  laura well heres the thing were trying to help you were trying to find a way to clicking  choking kill the fucks you get me illkay the agonsdray  matt drops the fruit he has in his hand please please help 
none	 us please  laura act natural keep picking keep picking keep picking we want to help you we really really  really want to help you  matt they have my daughter  laura oh shit  taliesin whos in charge  sam who has your daughter  taliesin no daughters right now  matt those beasts  sam beasts what beasts  laura the guards theyre keeping your daughter  matt keeping a lot of people  travis do you know where they keep them  matt he leans over nudges towards the direction of the city  taliesin 
town	 whos in charge  matt i dont know his name  sam and that spot that we saw just outside of town thats where gold is given to the dragon do  you know anything of that  matt he looks a little confused i dont know they just take what we have  liam the guy you dont know his name what does he look like where have you seen him  laura keep your voice down  liam im talking through skype so its a little more difficult for me  matt who are you talking about  
none	 liam the guy whos got your child you dont know his name what does he look like where have you  seen him  matt i dont know theyre all different types i havent seen the one who has them they have them  laura they the guards the people that serve the dragon  marisha what type of people are they interested in  matt halforcs interested in whoever keeps him at bay i dont know they take whoever seems  useful sometimes they take them and slaughter them before us as a warning  marisha then why did 
none	 they take your daughter  matt i dont want to think about it  laura to keep him working  travis look say we were really bored and we wanted to get you your family back  where would you go  matt he points over to the city but theres one right out and you see him pointing angrily  around the corner probably to the one that you saw on the outskirts of the farm area you guys  came down in  taliesin lets go to the city then i suppose  sam wait what  laura 
none	 theres a dragon  sam to do what to attack halforcs that work for a dragon  laura farmer whats your name  matt reginald  laura reginald reginald we want to help how often do you see the dragon flying around  matt once every couple days maybe  laura once every couple days when was the last time you saw him  matt about half a day ago dusk yesterday i dont know we all stay inside around that time  just in case  marisha does he have patrols does he have wyverns working for him as 
none	 well that fly around  matt i havent seen anything flying but the dragon there was a huge fight not more than a  week ago between these people and that thing they seem to have come to an accord  marisha these people  sam the orcs  matt the orcs the whatever they are the big strong angry ones that keep taking all of our stuff  marisha oh no  laura gasps  sam what what  laura what do they look like  marisha do they look like him maybe  matt some do  travis 
none	 oh fuck me  laura shit  travis fuck fuck fuck  matt the dragon came in and tore everything down  travis damn it shit hammer  matt burned liquefied dissolved portions of this city people screaming and then it left  both of them  sam youll be okay were going to keep going good luck  travis no wait wait  laura scanlan  sam no we have to keep going we cant face these goliaths and dragons and orc guards  this is craziness  marisha one of the dragons was green  matt from what 
none	 we saw  laura green and a black  matt green and a black i think a white one but that one kept going  sam i mean well be fine  marisha and the green one kept going  matt all of them kept going we thought we were safe we tried to regather and then within a  day a bunch of these bastards came and took what was left slaughtering stealing  travis weve got to go get his kid  laura i feel like we have to help them we have to help them  marisha 
town	 oh man i feel like you all are talking like i normally do and im talking like grog  normally does this is such a weird day  sam no youre using way too many prepositions  travis you said there are a lot of people that look like me  matt from what ive seen i dont go too far into town they keep me out here but ive seen a few  laura im keeping an eye out for the guard i want to keep an eye out for the guard make sure  hes not noticing  
none	 matt perception check  travis theyre in the city  matt most of them are yeah  sam were there six of them  laura 17  matt 17 okay you dont see the guard nearby  travis we need that guard  marisha what are we going to do right now  travis were going to ask him some questions  marisha this is a coup on a grander scale than whitestone that were talking about  travis i just want the guard  sam wheres the guard can we see him  matt you guys want to try 
none	 and find him  laura well i saw him on the other side of the thingie  matt okay you guys begin making your way towards the direction that vex saw the guard you start  pushing through the crop making your way to the edge and at the point where these high crops end  it opens up into what looks like a heavy rootbased field potatoes carrots things that  are beneath the ground you guys see across the way the two other farmers that were out there the  one that you saw being loosely beaten theyre 
none	 both filling satchels and emptying them into two  larger carts that are put up to horses one of them a larger pony you see what appears to be  another hulking humanoid taller than an average person skin slightly gray a smattering of  tattoos across the body you recognize  liam and best we can tell hes the only guard the only one  travis no theres two theres two  laura i have an idea  sam wait he was about to tell us who it is  matt from what you can see you actually recognize 
none	 this individual  travis fucking nipple tassels  matt this is an individual that you knew quite a ways ago a young goliath who was still about a  half a foot shorter than you when you knew him he was named horace because he hated it and kevdak  gave him this name and you actually at some point in the past recall even giving horace a good  beating a little of the smaller of the goliaths youve encountered this is years later this punk  kid and he was kind of a punk has grown up now 
none	 and is still smaller than you by a size but still  seems to be every bit of an agitating little bitch you remember from the way that hes treating  these people  travis is he holding anything  matt not in his hand at the moment no but he does have across the back what looks to be some  sort of large blade sheathed  laura can i give my idea  travis yep  laura what if we ask reginald to call for help like he needs this fucks help and then he comes  over 
none	 and then we spring a trap on him  marisha thats not a bad idea  laura i can use hide in plain sight on us and hide us and make us look like were part of the crops  travis i love it  laura to set an ambush  travis i love it  liam and the goal is to question this guy or to take him out to question yeah  travis were going to ask him questions and if he makes a peep hold on before we do that can  you see the other guard 
none	 that was out here  matt glancing about because it is a pretty open area you can see the secondary guard is walking  away looking to check one of the other homesteads there is a farmhouse  travis its like kansas right its flat  matt yep its flat farmland on the outside of westruun as soon as you break the south side of  the bramblewood its just plain  travis what distance would you put him at how far away would you put him 100 yards  laura the other guard  matt id say the other 
none	 guards probably a good 400 feet  travis do it  laura yeah  travis do it  laura can i take a minute to camouflage us and then tell reginald to call him over  matt yeah  travis when he comes over i grab him nobody do anything thats loud  laura got it  matt okay so as you all take a moment stepping into parts of the stalks of the edge of this land  vex you go ahead and start taking up leaves patches of dirt mud from freshly watered ground  and you start 
none	 smattering the rest of the group with it you guys are going full arnold from  predator you begin to blend into the vicinity  marisha question could i work with percy  taliesin yes  marisha i have entangle learned today could we fashion a quick entangle trap where when the guy  steps into it hell be entangled or i could maybe just be prepared for it  matt you can be prepared for it when it happens  marisha ill be prepared for it  taliesin im going to draw her a little sketch of something that 
none	 would spring that you can make out  of wood  matt the spell expends when cast so its more of waiting to release it to make it as part of a set  trap that would be a consumable trap you would have to construct  marisha all right ill just be prepped with it  matt okay so you guys all have hidden  laura reginald  matt hes behind you guys watching all of this happen yes  laura act like youre still picking and act like you hurt your ankle and call for help from that 
none	  guard over there well protect you  matt promise  travis yeah i promise  marisha and try and maybe keep a bit of a distance because im going to be doing a trap  here its going to be 20 feet you dont want to be in it  laura just step back and call for help  marisha just step back all right  matt so you guys are all working on the very edge of where these crop fields begin reginald pushes  through a little bit and goes ow ow ow you hear in the 
none	 distance a voice go hey you whats  your problem he goes my ankle and he starts hobbling into the crop you shut your trap its  your fucking ankle whats that stupid oh you grunts he starts lumbering up im going to  teach you about letting a peep out of that stupid maw of yours im going to beat that face so hard  it cant make a noise ever again stupid git  taliesin and now  marisha whoosh  laura the minute hes in the high crops so hes out of visual from the other guard 
none	  matt okay so as soon as he steps into the high crop area  marisha im waiting for percys cue  taliesin now  matt all right so what are the specifics of the entanglement spell  marisha 20 feet  sam it always works and it catches whoever you want  marisha it always works  matt all of a sudden all of the crops all of the large stalks and vines start whoosh wrapping  around his body  laura shit mother bitch  sam whats wrong  laura thats a bit obvious  marisha is it 
none	 obvious  matt its once hes inside the area so its not like the wall on the outside  laura okay i was picturing all the plants suddenly losing their shit  matt no just the ones in the immediate vicinity  sam like a used car lot  matt okay so hes going to attempt to make a strength saving throw  liam im going to squat at the edge of the high crops and keep an eye on the other guard who was  walking off just to make sure hes oblivious  matt make a perception check 
none	 if you could vax surprised so he has disadvantage on the saving  throw whats the dc  marisha me 19  matt 19 thats a failure all right and what  liam 28  matt 28 yeah vax keeping an eye the guard doesnt seem to have kept notice and continues  walking off towards the distant farmhouse the plants all wrap around his body and he  whats this stupid   travis i run over and i tackle him knock him to the ground put my hand over his mouth punch him  in the forehead punch 
none	 him again punch him a third time and i barely lift my hand  matt you motherfucker   travis punch him again  matt at this point now hes got blood pouring out of the corner of the eye one eye has gone a  little red from burst vessels you can see it starting to swell up already bloods now pouring  out the side of the nose where youve hit it and hes still fighting even though the plants have  kept him entangled as soon as the calm comes to him heavy breathing  travis singsong 
none	 horace  matt the eyes go wide and all the tension in the body loosens fucking hell  travis muffled fucking hell  matt youre still holding his face muffled fucking hell  travis im going to move my hand if you make a sound wash rinse repeat yeah nod  shut the fuck up  matt he spits a couple teeth out the side of his mouth  travis youre looking big  matt youre supposed to be dead youre supposed to be fucking dead i watched you beaten to death  why the fuck are you still alive 
town	  travis yeah right funny thing about me so look who else is out in this field with you right now  matt no one its me and cole but coles heading back to the city we have other ones  passed out around but most of them stay in town especially during the day thats where the  festivities are  laura festivities  matt do you want back in youre alive man nows the time its a good time for the herd  travis yeah no i want back in for sure thats what ive come here for 
none	 to come back in but  heres the thing its a bit of a surprise right other people havent seen me you like a good  surprise right horace  matt yeah  travis yeah i thought you might heres my question have you seen my cousin zanror  is he in the city  matt probably aye  travis right and what about kevdak  matt kevdak stays in the city as well up at the old margraves place actually turned it into  his palace want me to take you  taliesin before we go any further what 
none	 do i roll if i want to find out if horace really does like  surprises im not kidding  matt make an insight check all of you guys are still hidden by the way unless you want  to do something  taliesin no im just watching  laura and we gained another plus ten so now we have plus 20 to all of our stealth by the way  from that hide in plain sight  sam wait what  laura we have pass without a trace which adds plus ten hide in plain sight adds plus ten 
none	  thats what i camouflaged us fucking for  sam how do you have all these things  matt all of you guys make another stealth check with plus 20  marisha natural 20 so 40 actually i have a stealth of seven  laura 46  taliesin 43  marisha 47  matt you guys have never been seen retroactively no ones ever seen you in your  entire lives  taliesin i could fire my gun at this point and theyd be like oh rains coming  matt if it was bad news it would still probably break 
none	 stealth  taliesin well if it was bad news yeah  matt okay unless you rolled a one yeah no laughs horace hasnt seen anyone  i could take you in  travis right listen i was going to pounce on this poor farmer over here but i saw you were  obviously keeping your eye on him why are you doing that  matt which one are you talking about reggie  travis yeah old broken foot over here  matt laughs hes a little bitch that one is no but you know what i caught him sniffing  
none	 around i think hes keeping some gold hidden  travis really gold this poor farmer  matt twisted his arm a couple of times  travis have you  matt we could do this for old times sake each take an arm pull until he tells us  travis oh like wishbone  matt yeah  travis yeah that does sound like a good idea heres my thing why are you guys in this city  its not really our thing to be in civilized places  matt heres the thing let me get loose here for a minute im 
town	 feeling a bit uncomfortable  travis no i dont think i will horace  matt okay we were heading up north we took out a small caravan just south of the road cuts near  the silvercut way and all of a sudden out of the sky we saw these streaking dragons come through  largest ive ever seen dangerous as the days long so we fled we watched them come here and  tear into this city rend it destroy it smoke and flames and ice and all sorts of craziness and  they kept going we figured dragons 
none	 come didnt take the spoils theres plenty of spoils for us  more than we could ever dream of most of its pretty wellguarded but there couldnt be much  left over there so we gathered up who we had and mind you the herds swelled a bit since you left  my friend we conquered another wandering tribe last year zanror took the head of their leader  and commanded them to join were about a hundred strong these days  travis jesus  marisha fuck  matt pecking order still us goliaths at the top we got all 
town	 sorts of other piddly men  travis really  matt halfmen halforcs a few brutalized elves here and there they make cooking easy anyway we  took that moment and we rushed into the town took it before the day was over killed all who didnt  bow before kevdak himself days of revelry ensued my friend oh you missed out wine women gold  we took what we wanted until one of them dragons came back black one scary killed a lot of us  we werent so much a hundred strong then but by the end of that 
none	 we had 50 or 60 to our name before  the anger finally stopped kevdak bent a knee and made an offering to this dragon  travis kevdak did  matt i know but trust me you see a beast this size it was survival through a mutual discussion if you  will promised our might to its worship gathered our spoils deliver it every now and then we got  to have the leftovers we rule the city in its stead not a bad deal doesnt watch we leave it  what we find most of it at least 
none	 we keep a little on the side and we live like kings here  westruun is now property of the herd  travis well it sounds really good  matt youve missed out and theres quite a few openings now since weve lost a few of the less  than strong folk you look strapping im sure kevdak would be more than happy to have you back  travis i do ive actually brought a few gifts  laura whispering i notch an arrow  travis i unsheathe craven edge  matt thats a good blade  travis isnt it 
none	 and i ask out loud are you hungry  matt its been probably half a day since breakfast aye why his expression begins to  shift as realization begins to dawn on his face  travis i pull it back i stick the point in between his ribcage and i drive it up through him  shocked noises  matt before he can say a word he tries to speak through the pain but its met with the gurgle as  various bodily fluids fill the inside of his lungs and throat  travis oh more  matt the blade 
none	 now you can see choking noise peeks through the back of the mouth as his eyes go  ever so dull the rest of the blood flow pouring out the sides of his mouth  travis pity that acid reflux  laura grog oh shit good job there  marisha vex  matt as this is happening the blood that has filled the mouth begins to seep back into the  mouth the trails are still there but what was once filled to the brim has been slowly recessed  swallowed not by the unmoving body of horace but the 
dung	 dark blade itself now drawing from the inside  laura what the fuck is that sword grog  travis what  laura what is your sword doing  travis nothing it takes in the strength of who it slays  laura it takes in the blood  travis did it do that  laura grog  travis what  sam you killed him was he related to you in some way  travis i dont know i remember him he was always a little shit  marisha grog do you remember killing him five seconds ago  travis who  
none	 marisha oh no you guys  laura the little dude your little friend  travis horace  laura you killed him on purpose  travis sure  laura you wanted to  travis yeah he was going to go tell about us  marisha you were conscious of that  travis what  marisha is it me  sam youre using toobig words  travis so listen right either we stay and do some recon or we take out the other guy thats  walking back to the city really shouldnt be a problem but if theyre all in there 
none	 50 strong i  dont think were quite ready for that the sneaky fucks in our group could go take a look if youre  feeling randy  sam what would be our mission  travis info only  sam you killed this one quite easily  marisha very easily  travis yeah but thats because we did it as a group  marisha did we  laura could we wait until nightfall  sam im going to check out his body see if theres any booty on his body  laura well as soon as we move we wont 
none	 be camouflaged in this crop anymore well lose that  marisha yeah we wont look like crops  matt as the stalks unwind leaving his defiled body and you draw the blade free scanlan you  find across the body there is a simple slightly chippedbutstillfunctional greatsword that was  sheathed in the back wrapped in a haphazard hide that functioned as a scabbard mostly just leather  pants a few furs looks to be a bone necklace and a bone bracelet around the wrist which looks to be  teeth human teeth about 27 gold pieces in total change 
none	  travis how far are we from the city here  matt about a fiveminute walk  travis fiveminute walk thats not far  laura keyleth can you use your powers to suck him into the ground so that nobody sees him  taliesin i honestly dont think theyre going to find him anyway  laura i use my abilities and try to camouflage the body so that nobody finds him  matt you pull him up into one of the walls of the plant stalks and set him in there mounding up  whatever bits of fallen leaves and 
none	 dirt you can hes pretty wellhidden  marisha i use my druidcraft to grow some flowers on top of the dirt  matt some flowers come up there some of the local leaves from the stalks bend down and help  cover him up  taliesin leave a couple of his human teeth that hes collected  sam ill leave all his human teeth im not gonna take that shit  marisha great so very successful trip stopping down  laura reggie  liam his partners still longgone  travis that guard  laura the other guard yeah  matt 
none	 the guards gone reggies still sitting there watched this whole thing happen looking at  you and goes you did good you did good  travis i know i did just imagine what well do to the rest of them  matt thank you thank you  sam are we going to do anything to the rest of them  laura right now  taliesin i think were going to go take a look  travis i dont mind you taking a look but be careful  taliesin we can also still turn into mist  marisha we can  
none	 laura they cant hurt us when were mist  sam we can all mist and go into the city and check it out  laura see what we see  taliesin be fast and stealthy  laura can we stealth while were misting  sam it doesnt matter if they see us they cant do anything to us  matt yeah it would be being conscious of the cloud patterns in the sky moving with the wind in  a way where you become less noticeable as something strange so its possible  laura lets try that so we can 
none	 spy on the city get closer in  travis it feels kind of cheap  laura why  travis i dont know  laura at least if we go in grog we can see what were up against  travis yeah but cant we use our eyes just as they are do we have to turn to smoke this time  marisha why would we not  travis it feels a little cowardly  laura its not cowardly grog its safe  sam you can stay behind  liam what if vex and i went as mist just the two 
none	 of us quickly just the two of us  travis yeah thats fine  taliesin i may join you two for this as well  laura all right  marisha and what are the rest of us going to do just wait me scanlan and grog  travis you can turn into a cloud and float in there and see what you want to see but im not  turning into mist when my herd is inside that city if i go in im going in  sam as grog  travis yeah  marisha so why dont we just 
none	 not go in right now  sam why dont you all go in ill stay back with grog  travis thank you  laura all right  taliesin not crazyish  matt all right the four of you convert into mist form crest up over the edge and start drifting  your way over the top of westruun leaving scanlan grog and reginald amongst the crops  travis reginald you want some ale  matt do you have some  travis no i do yeah hold on get the cask out pour him a cup  matt he drinks thirstily 
none	 both because he seems genuinely thirsty and second it seems like he  could use a long hard drink  travis pace yourself son theres a lot thats here  matt ive been drinking longer than youve been alive friend just guzzles  travis wow another  matt yeah  travis ill keep them coming  matt and for that well take a quick break come back here see you guys here in a few  minutes and well continue this story see you in a minute  break  taliesin cock goblin  matt welcome back ha ha they 
none	 got it on stream sorry liam were not as good as you are at it  so guys quick note before we get back into the game apparently the shirt link wasnt working  earlier it is working now they got it functional so go ahead and hop on now while you  can returning from the break as grog and scanlan sit waiting to hear back from the rest of the  team traversing over towards westruun seeking information in their mist forms the two of you  remain behind the four of you guys who are in mist 
town	 form where are you going  laura can we stealthily head towards a pocket of people do we see a crowd of people being held  matt this is your mist form  laura this is my mist form  matt ocean i like it id like you guys to make stealth checks  laura stealth checks  marisha do we still have pass without a trace  laura yes  39  liam 42  taliesin 33  marisha 24  matt you guys make your way across the rest of the fields you head over cole you can 
none	 see  walking his way to the outside of the western side of the city you come towards the bottom of the  gate you can see the rigid small fence structure you noticed when you were far away from the city  becomes more clearly visible it is a series of spears and pikes that are set up as a barrier or a  barricade to the outside world to westruun you do see adorned atop a number of them a few heads  varying sizes various people various ages  marisha does this appear to be goliathbuilt  
none	 matt its hard to say it looks built  laura and the spikes are facing inward towards the city or outward  matt outwards there are breaks in it but essentially its partially a pseudodefense  mechanism its more as a warning its a point of intimidation  marisha so does it look pretty jerryrigged  matt yeah its not anything too classically designed  liam no flying buttresses  matt not quite no  taliesin doric columns oh my god awful tacky  matt you coast over the outside wall and glance down within you can see there are 
town	 people  wandering the town townsfolk that are out in the streets many of them are in pairs or groups two  to four people appear to be traveling from one place to another most of them are accompanied  by one or two armed individuals some of the people have chains around their neck you do see a  number of these buildings are in ruins patchwork places some are just crushed some appear to have  been melted down like the wood or stonework itself has been dissolved into a pile of matter  you see places where 
town	 fires have broken out and some places have burned into a giant cluster of  ash and broken wood a quick memory glance at this height you start looking for specific areas that  you recall from memory one you glance over and see where you first came to meet pike where she  and wilhand lived that area is the area of town that was apparently salvaged from the battle it  still stands there appears to be very minimal impact as you give yourself enough closeness to  check in the red brick homestead of wilhand does appear 
town	 to be standing  laura can we see wilhand anywhere  matt at this distance no you also note towards the shopping district of westruun there is the shop  of abjurist noja one of your first enchanter friends who protected you during your first  winters crest  marisha yeah he cast the protection spell on us  taliesin this is making me feel very old  matt his structure is still standing as well a few buildings around did not fare so well but his  shop and a number of other ones adjacent to it seem to 
town	 still be standing you cant really tell  if theyre functional or how busy they are or if anyones doing anything with them but thats still  there you do notice though at numerous parts of the street there are just piles and piles of  burnt wood and ash like theyre large burn piles that were set at different periods of time and  have long since burned little bits of white postburning plumes that still smolder over the  past few days youre not quite sure what these piles contained at the time they were set ablaze  
town	 there is still the worship district here you have the various temples best you can glance a few of  them have been partially toppled there is damage to some of the buildings still too far away to  make out any specific details beyond that some of the structures having taken a hit in previous  conflicts youre not sure from which source  laura what about the mayors house where we heard horace  matt the margraves towards the southern central portion of westruun south of the main town square where  the bulk of your first winters 
none	 crest festival here in westruun took place the margraves house  is at the very southernmost portion of that that entire square is lined with row after row of  sharpened wood sticks and various other weapons tridents broken swords that have been with  ropes strapped together to form a military barricade if anything were to attempt to attack  from the ground it would be difficult to do so if this area was filled with prepared soldiers using  these as protective guard the actual margraves home is intact although at this glance you can  see a 
dung	 lot of it has been defiled elements of the outside walls are strewn with dark burgundy paint  slapped over you can see what looks to be some sort of strings adorning edges of it like  decoration you see walking through this area what looks to be 12 or 13 or so armed individuals  of varying heights probably a good six or seven goliaths among them others appear to be human  halforc its hard to make out the full details from this distance theyre all on the outskirts  surrounding what was previously the margraves home now 
none	 the homestead of kevdak seemingly  laura can we see kevdak anywhere  matt you have no idea what kevdak looks like  laura i look for a bigger goliath than the rest or one that looks older and bigger  matt make a perception check  laura 16  matt 16 at this distance its hard to make out any specific details you can barely make out the  fact that theyre goliath its only because youve traveled with grog so long you can pick out  the details the hairless form the tattoos the general tone of skin 
none	 theyre male and female  its a smattering of all different types of goliaths some of different thickness some that  are a little more barrelchested and wide some that are a little shorter there are other  similarly dressed individuals that are not goliaths as well but they seem to be more of a  subservient role within the herd than the goliaths that would be the ruling class within this  selfcontained society but no one stands out to you as matching the descriptions of kevdak that  grog gave you  taliesin the mansion seems to be 
none	 where theyve based their operations though  matt seemingly  laura we dont see a cluster of prisoners anywhere out in the open  taliesin wheres the prison i was being held in  matt the prison you were being held in was in the umbra hills thats far north of westruun  liam thats when we fought the nightmare  laura yeah  taliesin laughs imitates laura yeah  laura do we see a cluster  matt do you see a what  laura a cluster of prisoners out in the open at all or is it just out 
none	 around  matt its hard to tell because most everyone who lives here is in some way shape or form a  prisoner you do see at the various gates of the city as you went through theres about three four  individuals average stationed there nobody seems to be entering or exiting and the pace of those  that are not of the herd that you see walking through the city has a feel of hopelessness or  at least their presence outdoors is more of function they do what theyre told and if  theyre not youve already 
none	 seen what happens to them  marisha now what  taliesin maybe stealth isnt maybe grogs right we cant talk can we  marisha no were fucking clouds  laura can we say go back to the  liam yeah im gesturing to go get out  laura yeah lets go back  matt make a stealth check guys on the way out  sam 93  travis scanlan and i have been alone  laura 39  marisha 32  liam 44  taliesin 26  matt okay you guys make your way westward is there anything you guys 
none	 wanted to accomplish while  they were gone  sam just massage each other  travis right so i turn to scanlan and i say you and i are mates right  sam yes the best of mates  travis right could i confide something in you  sam i wasnt aware that you knew what that word meant  travis clears throat right well im full of surprises one of which is so i had this  horrible dream recently and in the dream i was killing all these people with this amazing sword  that i have  
none	 sam yes  travis but there were a lot of people and some of the people that got killed i knew and i feel  it has something to do with this sword that i have and the secret is i can hear the sword  talking to me  sam like talkingtalking or you just  travis yeah look so im telling you because you and i have such a history right and i feel like  you wont judge me but like im afraid the rest of the group wont quite understand i dont know  if im 
none	 crazy or if this sword is talking to me  sam do you see a mouth on it or anything  travis no i just hear a voice and i was wondering if maybe i take it out  sam all the time  travis no only when im holding it so like i could take it out now and we could see maybe if  you hear it  sam okay  travis so i take out craven edge  matt you take out craven edge you hold it out in front of you  travis craven edge how 
none	 did you enjoy your snack  matt it was a good snack a snack it was if theres more where that came from  i would be so thankful  travis are you getting that  sam no grog im not  travis youre not hearing anything no like super sexy lowpitched growl voice nothing  sam try one more time  travis no its not worth it look do you want to hold the sword  sam sure thats a good idea actually can i hold the sword how big is it  matt its a greatsword its almost 
none	 twice the length of your whole body and probably weighs  close to as much as you do  sam can you hold the top part and ill just hold it by the handle the hiltypart  travis i hold the blade and i hand the hilt towards scanlan  matt as you hand the hilt over towards him theres hesitation in the voice only you are worthy of  holding me you will hand me to no one  travis grunts see now now now craven im starting to feel like im doubting myself im  seeing things hes 
none	 talking to me  sam okay  travis im going to take it right back i just want him to experience your glory  matt make a charisma check  travis shit fuck thats bad  laura no  travis gulp seven  matt seven okay you cant give the sword up it means too much and the voice in your head says  only those proven worthy to feed me can carry me and you grog  sam grog hand me the sword  travis pained no on second thought dont worry about it its clearly and i take 
none	 it  back its not its just maybe i just need to see someone or talk to somebody clearly i mean  you dont its talking you dont hear it right  sam i dont hear it but maybe if you handed it to me i could  travis no its really heavy too and i sheathe it  sam do i believe him  matt make an insight check  sam not good  matt grog make a deception check  sam not good seven  travis three  laughing  matt grogs not the most able liar you 
none	 glean youre pretty good at seeing past the deceit of  others this definitely falls under the line of deceit as adorable as it is to see him try  sam grog you want to give me the sword and i will cast suggestion on him  laura ooh  matt is it a wisdom saving throw  sam i havent used it in a while and i dont have my thing  matt ill pull it up real fast just to make sure im pretty sure it is  taliesin i think it is  matt yep make a 
none	 wisdom saving throw  travis giant modifier on this one 16 with a modifier of zero  sam well 18 if im not using my thing  matt not using the cone so no it still fails so you feel compelled now to give this sword  youre like no thats a great idea  travis you know what thats a great idea i feel like you should hold this sword and i hold on to the  blade but i still hand the hilt to him  matt as he holds up the sword towards you you grasp the 
none	 handle as his hand touches it the  voice goes no only you can wield me go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw again  travis 18  matt im sorry thats a charisma saving throw  travis 19  matt 19  travis yeah plus one  matt all right you feel the influence of the blade begin into creep into your mind but the  bond you have with scanlan and the time youve traveled together you manage to shrug it off  fighting that impulse you still hand the blade over you take the handle you 
none	 let go of the  weapon you hold it in your hand now its a heavy thud  taliesin you ruin everything good you take everything good away from all of us  sam well its heavy  taliesin throw it into acid why dont you  travis ask it a question  sam oh i talk to it  travis yeah and itll talk right back its like that  sam oi craven edge have you been talking to my friend grog  matt theres a long beat of silence and then a barely audible annoyed sigh  liam 
none	 sing to it  matt all of a sudden you hear this tiny voice creep up in the back of your head if you truly  wish to hold me in your grasp i require you to prove to me your worthiness  travis is it saying something  sam no  travis no its not saying anything  sam craven edge how do i prove im worthy  travis what  laughing  matt the blade all of a sudden it almost seems to have a slight shift of its own like a divining  rod and it moves 
none	 and the blade shifts away from the direction of you and grog and gently shifts  down the way to an older gentleman whos now returned to picking a few crops and it points in  his direction and says prove to me  laura is it reggie  matt pointing to reginald  laura no  marisha not reggie  travis why are you pointing it at reggie  sam i dont think i can i dont think i want to so i think ill try to give the sword back to grog  matt make a charisma check 
none	  sam is this magic  matt its not a spell let me doublecheck if youre referring to the gnomish racial capability  let me go ahead and check the rules here because this could make a difference here  sam well its fine  matt against magic ill say yes because its technically a magical entity  sam natural 20  taliesin witchcraft  matt the sheer force of personality that begins to exude from this weapon you sense that it is  old it has seen many a hand and has probably taken far many more a life 
none	 but its not met a  gnome like you before scanlan shorthalt  taliesin singing never known a gnome like you before  sam take this back will you  travis yeah i take it back it talked to you then yeah  sam yes it did  travis right its creepy as shit  sam its very compelling i dont know if you should have this grog  travis confused sputtering now hold on i just wanted to make sure that i wasnt fucking you  know batshit crazy which im not and im really glad that were sharing 
dung	 in this now but hey  hey dont tell anyone promise me  sam all right i wont tell anyone but i might have to ask some questions about this  travis no thats why i brought you in youre all smart right and i always want to ask  questions like whats the first thing it remembers what was it doing with lord briarwood  sam does it tell you to kill things  travis no  sam a lot i know it does it just told me to kill something  travis you must be a dark wizard 
none	  sam does it tell you to kill things  travis no it just says its hungry  matt at which point you both hear a voice simultaneously go always hungry  sam yeah  travis you heard it that time holy shit i feel like kevin costner in field of dreams and youre  james earl jones ive got a friend in this now  laughing  taliesin oh boy  travis right so look you know  sam we should not tell the others about this this is very strange  travis yeah  sam they might freak 
none	 out  travis right  sam im going to ask about this when next we see pike ill ask her about it  travis yeah  sam find out if its good or bad or neutral because i dont know anything about this right i  dont know anything about this  matt make an arcana check  travis it could be good theres nothing wrong with being hungry  sam 12  matt 12 it seems magical  sam yeah i dont know dont know anything about this  matt as a bard you understand that there are certain 
none	 artifacts weapons that either upon their  creation upon their development had the essence of a creature or soul put into it or conversely  the weapon came into being as its own personality youre not sure of the nature of this and youre  unable to ascertain which side of the spectrum it lies on as far as morality goes  sam ill do some investigating in the meantime try not to kill anyone in our party  if it tells you to  travis i would never  sam well  travis never  sam okay  travis 
none	 no yeah theres never even like  sam lets just keep this between us  travis yeah totes  sam just like that time in emon when we  travis yep  sam doubleteamed  travis the eiffel tower  sam yep  travis yep all right  sam it was a  taliesin oh that went up my nose  laura ugh  matt at which point a few clusters of wind come landing out of the sky  marisha what green lights  laura thats us  matt you guys youre the mist  marisha panicked yelling oh 
none	 its just me  taliesin youre literally just scared of your hands  marisha relieved oh  travis what did  sam nothing happened here how was your trip  travis yeah boring here  laura totally boring  travis yep no action  laura you know not a lot to see there theres a lot of goliaths and a lot of other bad guys  walking around oppressing very nicelooking people  travis a lot of goliaths  marisha theyve made really poky fences everywhere  travis thats what id do  laura it looks like if we barged 
none	 in straight in theyd probably have very good fortifications  travis right  marisha i also think theyre trying to be scary  travis trying to be scary  marisha not that youre not scary all the time grog i just think theyre like ooh  laura they really want to look scary  marisha they really want to look tough yeah  laura so heres the thing do we barge in totally risk our lives or try to find a way  around this situation  sam theres a central stronghold of some sort  taliesin yes  sam 
none	 is it a fortress  laura its where the mayor lived before  sam its a house  laura yeah its like a big house  taliesin and marisha its a nice house  sam and if we were to make our way into it somehow what would our mission be  liam well lets put on the table what were doing here right kevdak has the knuckles we  dont know where he is hes probably pretty formidable on his own and in a day or two a  dragon is going to be swinging by so its not 
none	 one problem its a very large problem  and a massive problem  travis agreed  laura i wonder if kevdak goes to the sacrificial area where they leave the hoard for the dragon  taliesin i wouldnt  marisha or if he does rounds to check in on people  taliesin ill also say i think its more than likely that in the end i doubt the dragons would  care who is filling the sacrificial plate  laura as long as someone is  taliesin as long as the plates full  travis as far as this city 
none	 goes correct me if im wrong but we have two options either we  stealth in with the stealthy people not me included and we try and pickpocket kevdak for the  knuckles or i challenge kevdak for the knuckles  marisha is kevdak known to ever wander off by himself does he take interest in his subjects to  where we could corner him alone  laura or is it a walk in and try to challenge him  sam we could take out that guard what was his name cole or something  travis yeah cole was heading 
none	 back to the city though  sam well we could find one of your goliath friends hold them hostage  and draw out kevdak that way  travis they wont care about a hostage  marisha there also could be the issue of are they going to go looking for horace  travis maybe not that hard though  sam we could do some sort of a diversion set a fire or something that would draw them out or set  a fire to the house they live in  marisha thats not a bad idea what would bring kevdak 
none	 out  taliesin grog grog would bring kevdak out  marisha grog  sam do you want to march in there solo while we stealth  laura no  sam no no while we all stealth around in the rooftops watching ready to act  liam grog im curious how tied you feel to the ways of your people now or if you do do you feel  the need yourself to face him on your own or would you be amenable would you be friendly to  the idea of my sister and i softening him up for a 
none	 moment and then letting you have at it what do  you want to do here  travis so my fear is this that if its anyone but me and him everyone gets involved not just  us but all 60 of them in that stronghold i dont think we walk out of that very well im not  opposed to facing him headon and seeing what fate has in store for me while you free any prisoners  that might be around or ransacking his house for any fun bits but i think hes going to have the  
town	 knuckles on him  marisha question is your herd and kevdak the type where if you start getting the upper hand in  this fight will the herd move to protect kevdak  travis no  marisha so theyll honor a oneonone fight theyll honor that they wont pull a fast one and  swarm in when hes on his last leg  sam tell us this if we walk in with you into town is that not good should you walk into town  alone and we lurk in the shadows  marisha do you want to be on 
none	 a hilltop like standing on a hilltop  because we could arrange that  travis i would need to think about it regardless i think now is not the time perhaps  we go look for osysas mate  sam you dont want to do this now it seems like now or never  marisha we know where kevdak is he doesnt seem to be going anywhere  sam we may not know where he is after this  travis he seems pretty fortified and we dont have pike and this is her hometown  marisha judging by the no 
none	 i didnt hear any of that  liam i want to throw something in here as well and i dont know what to do in this situation im  looking to you all for guidance but i do know two things one is that i dont want you to fall  grog we need you and i do not want you to fall to kevdak and second if you do fall im not  willing to walk away without those knuckles not for me to use but for us to use we need those  knuckles so if you are
