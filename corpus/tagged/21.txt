none	 we left off on this adventure  giggling  matt goddamn it liam last we left off on this adventure vox machina had been counting down  their preparations to the eventual showdown and second battle with vecna whom they discovered  recently had completed his ascension into godhood the only god on the prime material plane not  knowing what his plans were you began to bring together what information you had upon gathering  blessings from different deities and pieces of their divinity to craft the prime trammels a  device that was once used to seal the 
none	 chained oblivion long ago  you traveled deep beneath the volcano of scaldseat beneath the ocean off the coast of  issylra between percival and grogs newfound imbuement of skills and knowledge via ioun you  managed to successfully defeat the guardian craft the trammels and return to vasselheim where you  discovered via pike that there was a council meeting happening within the platinum sanctuary  there you met up with the hand of ord  marisha yeah everyone was there  matt high hierophant ophera of the birthheart there was earthbreaker groon there were maidens of the  
none	 raven eventually allura and kima and jmon sa ord had also come into the fray  during this discussion about what to do what to handle you were granted a ring by high bearer  vord that within a certain radius could prevent divinations or specifically scrying on you not  the school of divination but magics that divine your location whatevers in your vicinity  this moment the council was interrupted by an image of vecna taunting you until it was  dispelled by allura the discussion was that something was going on in the mountain range where  
none	 vecna seemed to have thar amphala which had been discovered by a couple of surviving wyvern riders  thinking about the two possible locations that could be of interest to vecna you gathered your  materials your preparations and with the first striking lot of wyvern riders on the back of the  newly transformed jmon sa ord into the devossa dragon form you were transported via druids to  the northern icy landscape of issylra to the base of the zenwick mountains  you discovered that the crypts of thomara an ancient forgotten dwarven society that had  destroyed 
none	 itself through cannibalism and madness was now a sinkhole in the mountain range and a  series of large heavy 150plusfootacross cavernous openings in the ground formed a pattern  that you soon discovered were footfalls steps you came upon the risen undead primordial earth  titan long left beneath the surface of the world dead since the founding now given unlife and  walking its way southeast towards vasselheim atop its shoulders you saw thar amphala protected by  some sort of magical barrier  there you struggled with a few fleets of flying gloomstalkers that were charging their 
none	 way towards  you you turned yourself invisible through both scanlan and jmon sa ord jmon or devossa both  forms same person you managed to thanks to a very high roll from keyleth discover there was a  waterfall or trickle of liquid near the hip of this giant titan its giant four swinging arms  of imminent danger in its vicinity only managed to clip keyleth and vax once  surviving the impact you all gathered at this ingress right around the hip of the titan where  you leapt off the dragon and proceeded to make your 
none	 way in keyleth using control water was  keeping the heavy flow of an underground river from blowing you off the broken steps that lead  into your entry and that is where we left off  at this time keyleth as youre all standing looking over your shoulder you can see the  opening where you entered its this giant view through this window where you can see down below  the mountains and the valleys and the landscapes outside you can hear the wind blowing  though and battering like a heavy deep whistle oh and we have 
none	 the rest of our party perfect  timing welcome  sam okay well start from announcements again  liam i did a very good job with merchandise  laura did you what did you say about merchandise  sam he didnt say anything but he did a great impression of you  laura cool sorry about that  sam a professional is on time laura  travis it was actually up to me to remember and i didnt she was closest to home  matt so thank you laura as you all stand on the outside of the opening of 
none	 this titan ingress the  slick stone steps that break off and crumble into the open expanse where you can plummet hundreds of  feet to your death should you slip keyleth is holding the water at bay keeping the flow from  pushing you all back outside of the large earth entity gathering your strength you watch as  jmon sa ords brass dragon form flies just outside of your visual range you now all stand  within this 15footwide entryway what do you do  taliesin is there a passage so we can get out of the flow 
none	 of the water once its been released  matt currently the flow mostly covers about ten to 15 feet of this opening it flows downward  its not super strong but its enough where it would be somewhat dangerous to some of you  however keyleth is keeping it at bay for as long as she can concentrate  liam if she werent controlling it would there still be even though its dangerous some air  matt yeah it may be up to your knees as far as the flow its a possible slip and youre  fighting the current 
none	 to push you outside of the titan  marisha its concentration up to ten minutes so lets move quickly  sam so were going in into the giant  taliesin well its either that or back out  laura do i still have pass without a trace on us  matt you havent lost concentration on it so i imagine so whats the marching order by the way  liam ill be up front  matt all right we have vax up front whos next  marisha ill be behind vax since we touched down first i guess  matt 
none	 all right keyleths after vax whos next  laura i will be behind them  matt all right is trinket still in your necklace  laura yeah im bamfing him out right now  matt okay trinket is out next to you whos after vex  sam i will be lucky pierre right in the middle  liam pike will walk right in front of grog  travis ill be the caboose  taliesin ill be between pike and grog right there  matt okay good to know slick steps across the smooth stone walkway the water however being  
none	 kept at bay by keyleth you watch as this river is being curled back into itself the flow is being  staunched its briefly frozen in time its a unique thing to see especially as there is no  light source inside so you can see especially those of you with darkvision the flow and the  movement it swirls back on itself and seems to be contained in that space as you push up bits of  it splash and trickle out to the side but for the most part you maintain complete control of this flow  as 
none	 you continue up the cracked stone stairs theres a slight right curvature up into this  shaded area the roof of this opening is maybe ten feet tall it dips down with some of the rough  rock outside and ceiling area of this to about seven to six feet grog you have to dip down a  few times you see hints of stalactites that you have to maneuver around and push through its not  a huge opening and it seems to vary in its size with each heavy footfall you have to catch  yourself on the 
none	 wall as the impact and the shake the crashing of each step of the titan youre  within seems to cause you to shift slightly and a faint bit of dust be released from the tunnel  around you  liam because we dont know what part of this is the titans butt and earth but some of it could  have been made by cannibal dwarves at some point im going to assume im looking for traps and  listening for undead cannibal dwarves  matt okay so youre taking a very slow approach  marisha actually thats a 
none	 good point does this look like it was carved by man from cannibal  dwarves or naturemade  matt make an investigation check  marisha investigation or nature check  matt this would not be a nature check  marisha my better one that doesnt count no nope four total  matt much of this tunnel seems to be natural cavern but there were steps when you first came  in there were stone steps that were carved or placed within the dirt that eventually were  consumed or covered by silt and loose earth and whatever the river knocked 
none	 loose and began to flow  over it so you can see both a lot of this is natural but there seem to be at least in the 30  or 40 feet youve made into the tunnel youve seen elements of civilization of crafted entry  that merge with the terrain  marisha did we get a time frame of how long ago this crypt was built before how old this crypt  has been around  matt early age of arcanum so best estimate from what you knew you guys both learning of the  history of this 
none	 well over 1500 years if not longer  sam before the great war thing  matt after the founding which was the first great war where the titans were slaughtered  beginning of the age of arcanum which was long before the divergence  travis can i touch the ground now that were in the titan im thinking maybe this might be where  the knuckles are from can i touch it and see if the oven mitts do anything  matt their general faint vibration never stops theres a perpetual very minute hum to them  touching it doesnt 
none	 seem to have any effect or change the proximity seems to be triggering some  sort of harmonization  travis i reach up and touch my adams apple and vibrating this place is crazy sorry no you  wouldnt do it i thought you would  matt all right so make an investigation check vax as you slowly lead the group up this slightly  curving tunnel  liam that is a 27  matt 27 okay  laura i didnt get to sort them  matt well you should do that now  taliesin chaos introducing chaos  matt 
none	 as you guys slowly make your way along the path behind vax you look out and occasionally  see bits of loose earth that looks looser than most as you brush it aside you can see the steps  continue a lot of its been buried but this was a staircase that slowly ascended and curved the  movement of the titan seems to have knocked a lot of the loose tunnel to cover it as you brush it  aside you carefully look about and you can see that there are occasional symbols of a writing you  dont 
none	 understand but nothing stands out to you as a trap or a trigger  marisha does it look familiar to any of us  matt what languages do you guys know  travis why are you even looking over here i know stick figures i know charades  matt do any of you know dwarven  laura you can read dwarven now you can read now grog you can read four to fiveletter words  travis i can read dwarven because of the belt  sam but only tiny bits  travis yeah i might fuck up the bigger pieces 
none	  matt grog as vax points out some of these symbols you sit there and concentrate really hard  on one of the carvings in the recently uncovered stone step as you focus you begin to sound out  the sound to yourself repeatedly hesitant syllables youre trying to find the right way to  pronounce it  travis baaramewe babe anyone  matt it takes you about two to three minutes to sound this out which knocks about two to three  minutes off of your concentration time for your control water spell but this looks to be carved 
none	  in as a warning  travis du du hast du hast mich  laughter  matt strangely if you could have seen thomara when it was a highly functioning society they  would have been blasting rammstein everywhere man  liam speak rammstein and enter  matt yeah these werent the happygolucky dwarves of old this was a brutal clan  travis it looks like a warning of some kind  matt the rough translation from what you can spending about five minutes or so breaking out  this glyph and a few other glyphs it says leave death 
none	 here no further  travis right it says leaves death here no further so leaves death here leaves of death  here but no further im still working it out  sam maybe its no fur maybe we should leave trinket im just saying thats the furriest one  i dont want trinket to die  laura thanks scanlan  marisha i feel like we already knew so much of that  travis ive been working really hard that was five minutes of the most concentration ive ever  given to one thing in my life thanks  marisha okay 
none	 lets get up this river before i lose concentration  matt you push up another 60 or so feet vax still keeping the point man on this slowly pulling  forward you begin to hear the sound of rushing water growing louder and louder you eventually  come across the rift in the ceiling that is spilling forth the water that is forming this  river it looks like there is a recent crack and a piece of eroded earth that has fallen out from  some sort of water source further up inside the titan that is causing this 
none	 river to continuously  run in and out of this titan  sam how does this work how much water could a titan hold  marisha well this thing is massive  sam i know but is there a barrel of water in his chest  marisha maybe a lake an underground lake  taliesin were always impressed by how much water comes out of you  matt at this point you guys would be able to move around and continue up past where this  opening is and the river would no longer be impeding your path  laura 
none	 lets do that keep moving up right thats where the city is  sam sure  marisha hang on can i do a nature check is there anything weird about this  laura while shes doing a nature check i want to do primeval awareness and sense undead in the  area within a mile of me  matt okay many  laura within the mile  matt within a mile which is the entirety of the titan many thousands  travis but theyre probably in inoperable pieces  laura are they all above us or are some near us 
none	  matt nothing within the very immediate vicinity due to the limitations of primeval awareness which  does not show you the exact location you sense the presence and vague direction forward and  upward there is this giant mass of undead force that the minute you focus it causes you to hold  your breath as soon as the impact hits you you have to remind yourself to exhale  sam but maybe theyre all hypnotized or something  marisha 17  matt okay the structural damage appears to be natural as you pay attention and watch as another 
none	  footfall of the titan hits crashing and it shakes you watch as another piece of rock falls  and a little of the water flow expands to allow a little more water to exit you get the sense that  as the titan moves the longer it travels  marisha the more its going to fall apart  matt or at least portions of it that were built into the titan that arent part of its natural body  marisha start to crumble  matt some of them may  laura what if we earthquake the titan  sam 
none	 to do what  laura to fucking fall apart  sam but were in it  laura yeah but we could take out the entire city  sam were in it  taliesin last time we did that it kept floating up top  laura but it couldnt move for a while  marisha we have to get to the top this thing is too big i dont think my earthquake will do enough  liam its in the grab bag its an option  travis if were inside the gi tract of this titan and we give it an 
none	 earthquake is it basically like  a big old dead titan fart  laura potentially it could shit out a lot of dwarven zombies  taliesin it is also an option if we do get overrun  travis true  marisha did you learn it today pike  laura yeah  sam oh were playing pike  liam were playing pike  sam you two  liam we are were the pike jaegers  sam okay  laura mostly liam  liam you can do the impression and i will sort through the pages  matt there you go as 
none	 you guys descend past the rushing water the sound of the river begins to  slowly fade behind you as you continue to spiral upward this slow crawling ascending tunnel the  dirt that consumes the stairs at your feet eventually begins to give away as your feet find  purchase in softer earth from loose gravel and the rocky terrain as you continue to push further and  further into the interior of this titan you feel another heavy impacting footfall and all of you  have to brace yourself against the nearby wall this impact seeming heavier than 
none	 others and as it  does a number of rocks tumble past  laura what do you think he just did do you think he just fell  sam maybe  taliesin i think he swung at something  matt another footfall  another footfall every single hit seems to cause the foreign structures on the inside to hope  that they were made well another heavy footfall hits even heavier than the last and this one the  impact hits so hard that you guys are almost thrown to your knees as you reach out and you  hear 
none	 this loud crack sound above you i need scanlan pike percival and grog to make a  dexterity saving throw please  sam dex huh  matt yep  liam pike needs to do it too right  matt yep  travis natural 20 gil coming in in the clutch  taliesin 15  sam 13  liam 13 for the other gnome  matt all right everyone but grog you glance up just in time to watch as a large piece of the  tunnel ceiling dislodges and comes plummeting down in your direction grog you dive out of 
none	 the way  being clipped off the shoulder but you manage to avoid most of the impact the rest of you  however immediately get buried by rock and broken earth suffering 29 points of bludgeoning damage  to percival pike and scanlan and they are buried and restrained right now  unable to breathe  travis i go over and i start boulders dirt everything  matt between all of you guys able to help its a negligible period of time and it wasnt too heavy  of an impact you manage to get them free over the next 
none	 five or so minutes they get their breath  back a bit battered but you get the sense that you should travel quickly  laura well keep going quickly then  matt picking up the pace you continue up the curvature of the upward ascension its probably  been about 60 or 70 feet since youve seen any carved portion of terrain any sign of previous  dwarven construct or building or architecture as the tunnel stops at the curve it eventually  looking ahead ascends a bit about a tenfoot climb up onto a plateau of some kind you 
none	 can see  some weird rootlike tree is growing out of one wall and seems to be dead and petrified in its  current space do you guys wish to ascend to the plateau  laura we probably should right  liam how far away is it  matt its about 40 feet from you right now  liam im going to creep up 20 feet in front of everybody else  laura i want to go with him i need to keep an eye out for the zombie dwarves  liam divine sense which is specific to undead location 
none	 not vague if theres any within 60  feet ill use one  matt okay focusing no undead within 60 feet of you  laura thats good  sam i drank a tiny little potion of healing i healed six  matt good job  liam so its leading up to a plateau  matt yeah it goes up about ten or so feet 15 feet up and then it leads to another plateau and  you cant see beyond that  liam im going to scuttle up and look over  matt okay are you stealthing roll a stealth 
none	 check  laura add ten to it  matt vex are you going with him or letting him scout ahead  laura i crawled up but then once he took off again then i stayed  matt okay  liam 41  matt 41 okay cool  travis 41  liam this is old news guys this is old news this is what i get to do  travis it seems new to me every time  matt all right you ascend to the top of this plateau it only goes on for about 15 feet and  then descends 
none	 down into another chamber that splits in two different directions a tunnel that  goes to the right and to the left you can see once again the stalactites some of them meeting  in the center with the stalagmites to form pillars you can see portions of the wall that  have collapsed and created these soft landslides in one corner to the right of you but currently  all you see is the descending tunnel and then the split and you cant see too far  one way or the other  liam yeah i turn around to 
none	 group and do like a and then i go down over stealthing along the way  matt okay anyone else what are you doing  laura i guess we follow  sam what did this mean did this mean we were supposed to follow him and split up  laura i think that means that theres a split in the path  sam lets split up anyway  laura scanlan you go one way and well go the other  matt okay so as the rest of you ascend to the top of the plateau you make your way down 
none	 to the  center and you can see that the path goes to the right and the left both seem fairly identical  though theyre traveling in opposite directions  taliesin we entered in the left side of the body  matt if you were to look at it straight on like its facing you it would be the right side  laura if its facing us  matt correct  marisha so our right its left  laura no its right our left  taliesin looking at its butt  matt if youre looking at its butt to the 
none	 right  taliesin all right to the right leg so if we split we probably want to keep to the core of it  marisha so go left to the left  sam that is a decision sure  taliesin well check obviously for air currents  matt at which point there is what sounds like an explosion of rock and dirt immediately to the left  of percival as two heavy rocklike limbs reach out grab and pull him against the wall as the  ceiling crumples over and collapses he has now vanished within the wall and now 
none	 leaving a pile  of rock in his place  laura percy keyleth keyleth dig him out  matt darkness and youre now restrained and there is no air  laura i start clawing at the wall where he was  matt you start clawing it at this point with the alertness piqued up between you two and  keyleth you glance around and you can see things emerging out of the nearby walls like the rocks  themselves are almost pushing through  marisha i say get to the middle stay away from the walls and i cast transmute 
none	 rock right in the  space where he went and i reach my hands in and try and grab him out of mud  matt okay  marisha yeah its a 3rdlevel spell  travis have you ever transmuted anything before  marisha ive done it once before and it didnt work very well  matt so as you do that this entire section of the wall squishing turns to a heavy soft mud  material and your arms plunge into it and you feel and you grab percival and pull him out  youre covered in thick sludgy mud 
none	 and as hes pulled out you guys glance around and you can  see shifting in the darkness the walls in certain places seem to almost move i need you all  to roll initiative  marisha were fighting walls first doors now walls  sam wow were already at a battle map  travis i know aquariums that dont look that good  matt percival youre pulled into this side there keyleth had just pulled you out there vex  and trinket  laura i would be closer to percy than trinket is  matt thats true you were 
none	 scrambling at the wall so that will be trinket over there  liam i was as well the twins were scrabbling at the rock  matt all right and that being the case then you guys are all clustered up in that platform  laura no  liam wait matt wait  travis robotically the walk sign is on  matt you watch as these creatures that are similar to the living earth physicality of the  titan andor the elemental form that keyleth has taken in the past seem to emerge but where their  once glowing elemental eyes 
none	 are theres a vacuous darkness you feel the rumble of the ground as  they shift and glide through the rock in their vicinity  marisha oh theyre undead necromantic elemental earth ellies  matt theyre not undead because you do not sense undead in the presence  laura wait oh no you guys guess what we didnt do we didnt have a feast  sam well how were we going to have a feast we were in a big board meeting and then we came here  matt so getting initiative orders here all right 25 to 20  
none	 taliesin 21  travis same thing  laura 21 as well  matt jeez all right 20 to 15  liam 19  sam 18  matt all right 15 to ten ten to five  marisha eight  liam pike rolled a one  matt got it top of the round percival as you emerge covered in the sludge you look around  you by the way right now you have no vision because nobody lit a torch i should remember  that you are a human you have no common sight well say for the purposes of this 
none	 you had a  torch out so you could see  taliesin i might have been using my flashlight i would imagine  liam does pikes mace of disruption always shed bright light for 20 feet  matt when she chooses to however as soon as you were pulled into the wall and then dragged back  out and the whole surface of it is coated you were seeing darkness in your turn you are  blinded right now  taliesin im blinded  matt yes because you cant see anything around you all you hear is the moving and 
none	 shifting of  rock and your allies all preparing for some sort of assault  taliesin im going to spend my turn removing the mud from my eyes and i think i still have a  charge in my flashlight at this point  matt you cant though it is covered in muck and mud  taliesin im going to spend my bonus action clearing that and then  matt well say itll take your whole turn to clear yourself and to clear the light from that  so there you go at that point the light at the front 
none	 of your weapon lights up illuminates the  vicinity and you see the moving shadows are bits of rock and stone moving living out of the  nearby walls  laura how do we fight rocks  marisha im about to tell you be careful they can go into the walls and earth glide so watch  your feet  matt percival you can move if you want to  taliesin yeah is there one right next to me right now  matt theres one maybe ten feet from you  taliesin im going to hop over by the little 
none	 pool fountain im going to back up and get out of this  clump of people  laura that sounded like you were casting a spell  marisha theyre vulnerable to thunder damage anything vibratey because rocks  matt which you will find out ill say that youre yelling that as everyone is preparing that  finishes percivals turn grog youre up  travis i would like to rage i would like to spin around 180 degrees and i would like to attack  clayface right about there  matt okay go for it  travis shit stain is down 
none	 at the bottom of the stairs reckless  matt go for it  sam great weapon master assassinate uncanny rage  travis 28  matt 28 hits  travis okay oh i reroll ones and twos nice 22 plus one point of necrotic 23 points of damage  matt 23 points of damage in the first hit as you spin around jaw open growling in rage yells  you bring the axe across and it cuts across the front of its chest you watch as pieces of rock  break off and it still holds strong against the impact  
none	 travis i do it again  matt go for it  travis reckless great weapon master this time  25  matt 25 hits  travis 31 points of damage  matt nice the second hit you swing around and slam it it actually gets stuck and wedged in part  of its body the mouth opens and gives this guttural grunts as a reaction actually giving a  pain exert upon the hit however as it reaches out both of its hands grab the edge of the axe  all right that end your turn  travis is he 
none	 holding my axe  matt hes attempting to  travis well i wanted to move  matt okay then move  travis im moving i would like to go counting 30 feet to face off with this guy  matt all right well that guy swings at you with his fist as you pull away you rip the axe out of  its grasp and instead it takes one wide swing with its right fist  laura but you slice his fingers off when he does it  matt he has advantage because you used reckless that is a 24

none	 14  matt 14 does not hit unfortunately as you mark it with your spell you pull back the first arrow  and it hits but it ends up exploding the shards of wood scattering off of it and your hear a  slight grunts  laura yeah you motherfucker okay 16  matt 16 misses just barely you go to shoot another arrow this time out of frustration as  you pull back and let it loose it actually backhands the arrow out of the air scattering the  shaft in the middle of the sky  laura wait 
none	 i didnt say sharpshooter i didnt say sharpshooter on that one did i i didnt clarify  matt so without the minus five what would it be  laura it would be 21  matt okay you didnt say it  laura i shouldve said it but i didnt say it  matt thats okay well let it go okay so roll damage regular damage so as it goes to backhand  it out of the air the arrow manages to sink in the center of its fist it still causes a crack to  widen across the various plates 
none	 that keep its left arm together  laura 16 plus five lightning damage and then since he is next to scanlan i get sneak attack  matt correct  laura ooh 12 15 sneak attack and then hunters mark three  matt all right fantastic 39 damage in one hit so the second one as it hits it causes this rift  in the center of its large battering ramlike arm to shift and crack and pieces of broken shale peel  and fall off to the ground around it does that end your turn  laura yeah  matt 
none	 do you want to move or do you want to stay where you are  laura im going to stay where i am  matt vax youre up  liam weve been in here under an hour probably not much time left but under an hour right  since we arrived  matt pushing close to an hour  liam okay how high is the ceiling in this tunnel  matt about 12 feet  liam 12 feet i will float above everybody in the space above their heads we can fudge it  probably between percy and pike if

none	 calculated from dexterity oh so two and 20 more for the sharpshooter  matt ah didnt add sharpshooter onto that keep that in mind as you release the torrent of  daggers down one of them slams into the chest as another hits and skids off to the side and  vanishes and the third one actually strikes right where the first dagger was driving it deeper in  both of them seem to wedge and break the interior of its chest and you watch as parts of its body  are falling off in chunks its giving this horrible 
none	 sucking sound like its barely holding  itself together wheezes but there it still stands that ends your turn scanlan youre up  sam okay i will rotate around the guy with the red ring around him so that im between him and  his friend  matt right there you mean okay youre right on the edge theres a platform dropoff behind you  sam singing im living on the edge  laughter  matt as you rush over there youre like grunts you watch as a couple rocks tumble off  and clatter below tenfoot drop not too

none	 one does save first one does not rolled a natural 20 on its saving throw the first  one rolled a five  sam what did the second one roll  matt natural 20  sam oh fuck okay that does they both take 4d8 damage and the one who didnt make his save gets  pushed away but hes right up against the wall  matt so it doesnt do anything however it does thunder damage which they are vulnerable to so  they take double damage from this  sam double damage  matt you watch as the 
none	 blast of thunder energy slams outward both of them you watch as their  bodies are thrown into the rock behind them  sam terrible 12 points  taliesin that was subpar  matt thats okay both of them get hit and thrown back slam into the wall and you watch as their  body is unable to earthglide based on the force of the impact so it actually causes part of their  body to crack intrinsically and they both fall back to the ground and their feet sink into the  stone about an inch or two and 
none	 they reposition their stance all right anything else you want to do  sam oh shit if i move away hes going to take a swing at me isnt he but that would be wise  matt your call  sam no ill shelter in place  matt okay now its their turn  travis theyre going to come out asking for help because theyve been  marisha weve been stuck in his digestive tract  travis and were slaughtering them we werent going to even say anything or do anything to you guys  matt first off i need 
none	 keyleth vex and percival to make a dexterity saving throw please  laura natural 20  matt nice  marisha that was so close to being a natural 20  taliesin not natural 20 but a 20 nonetheless  matt okay what did you get  marisha 12  matt all right  liam what youre sucked in the ground no  laura the ground raised up  marisha did they turn us to stone what did they do  matt no keyleth you all of a sudden watch as the one behind you that is barely holding on  
none	 angrily goes impact slams its fist into the ground and from the sudden vibration the earth  seems to rise up underneath and attempt to swallow you vex and percival you both grab each  others hands and leap into the air and it passes under your feet however keyleth is not fast  enough and gets swallowed as it closes up crash around her and now theres a giant pile of earth  and rock where keyleth is buried within and restrained you both manage to move out of the way  liam yeah vax sees that and is 
none	 not worried  laughter  laura shes fine  matt these guys are going to move up there and this guys going to move up here this guys going  to attempt to pummel the shit out of scanlan hes going to make two slam attacks against you that  is a 20 and a 21  sam yeah  matt you take 16 points of bludgeoning damage and 17 points of bludgeoning damage and you watch as  it slips into the wall and vanishes you can make an attack of opportunity against it however i am  giving 
none	 it threequarters cover as it pulls just out of melee range and is mostly in the wall so  it gets plus five to armor class  sam i will swing my sword at it with advantage because i just inspired someone and mythcarver  has that feature the first one was better 17 plus ten  matt that actually hits go ahead and roll damage  travis mythcarver gets you some action once every two years  sam i actually dont know it says its a plusthree longsword does that mean its 1d8 plus three  matt 1d8 plus 
none	 three plus your strength modifier  sam so its 1d8 plus four and then i rolled a one so thats five but it also says somewhere  in here deals an additional 1d6 force damage oh yeah one  matt hey six free points of damage it vanishes somewhere inside the wall youre not  entirely sure where two attacks on you percival that is a 28 and a 19  taliesin yeah  liam dang perce  matt 16 points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin 16  matt yep and 15 points of bludgeoning damage  sam shit on

none	 guy sinks into the ground  laura can we shoot him with an arrow as he sinks into the ground  matt no its a melee attack  taliesin so im going to take a swing  matt all right  taliesin that hits actually i crit only with my guns on a 19 right i dont crit with my sword  matt im pretty sure you crit on a 19 or 20 regardless but the hemorrhaging shot element  doesnt happen  taliesin the hemorrhaging shot obviously doesnt happen even though its a natural thats fine  i crit 
none	 so thats a ridiculous thing to hit 32 to hit  matt yeah that hits  taliesin so thats a 1d8  travis you never know that guy could be made out of concrete  taliesin two plus seven and its silvered if that matters thats 16 points of piercing damage  matt all right cool so you strike out as it disappears into the wall and vanishes this guy  here shifts into the wall as well  liam he vanished  matt well he sucking sound into the wall  laura theyre all vanishing  travis well not

none	 you grab with one hand the back of its fist and grin and then bring the axe straight up into  its torso with one hand it strikes and splits open part of its rock chest and you hear this  guttural wheeze which it reforms again but still its taken the brunt of the impact and  its now going to shift into the wall which you cant attack because you already used your  reaction that ends their turn keyleth youre up youre currently buried youre blinded  marisha okay im going to concentrate for a second and 
none	 then go earth elemental  thud and now that im earth elemental i have tremor sense can i sense where these other  motherfuckers are  matt you can feel where they are yeah you can sense them moving through the ground  sam oh shit everybody dies  marisha but i want to be underground im there but im still underground right now  matt right im marking your place  marisha yeah  taliesin singing underground  marisha singing put on your earthglide shoes and dance speaking okay i want to go right  in the center of

none	 roll damage with the fist so you slam him within the stonework  taliesin i love that youre actually being a badass where no one can see  marisha 15  matt 15 points of damage all right as you slam it your fists gliding through the rock like it  was air and slamming into the side pushing it even further forward it swoops underneath and  with a giant uppercut as it emerges from the ground the earth swings up to try and consume  both grog and trinket i need you both to make a dexterity saving 
dung	 throw trinket and grog  laura oh no  travis oh shit danger sense  laura oh no he rolled a one oh no this was a fan gift  travis 15  matt both of you your vision goes dark as the earth rises up to consume the space around you  both grog and trinket are currently restrained and blinded within the earth  laura oh no is trinket right next to grog at least  matt yeah theyre within a close area  sam grog youre inspired  travis oh its too late for that  matt 
none	 i would say so the actions already happened if you want to you can its what its  there for  liam we have a nice dm  travis 18  matt 18 all right you barely manage to avoid  laura oh now trinkets all alone  travis you are most gracious  matt so as the rock comes up to consume you it covers over both of you and theres a brief  moment of silence before grog bursts out and steps up onto the stone unaffected by the impact and  thats its full speed so it 
none	 cant earthglide again this one here is going to scoot and appear  right around the edge on that side  liam thats in range for me  matt it is yes  laura and me  matt roll a perception check  laura yeah thats a thing  liam 24  matt that hits and you do manage to  laura 26  matt you do see it so you can if you want  laura okay  matt yeah sorry i got a notification on my ipad that went like no music  liam am i effectively sneak

none	 emerges from behind you watch as it brings back both of its fists to attempt to  slam into the ground where scanlan is currently standing  sam he cant see me dont worry  laughter  matt yeah his heavy footfalls still touching and moving the earth in the vicinity its tremor sense  still notifying it of your base location as he goes to swing both of his fists  sam im mocking him  matt a flurry of daggers and arrows go flying through the air whoosh slamming into it before  its fist can come down 
none	 its chest is detonated from the impact the rock and shale scattering  against the sides of the wall its form destroyed and scattered  marisha kill it  liam thats a pretty fucking killer twin moment right there  travis ive got to ask when the creepy rock guy popped up near me is he within my held action  matt unfortunately no hes about ten feet from you youve hit in the space but the bear was  closer to him  travis fair enough i just stare at him  matt yes you do  this fellow 
tavern	 here emerges right behind percival right there and is going to attempt to  make two swing attacks at you  taliesin i make two attacks on him before anything happens anyway  matt mmhmm go for it  travis hes a little drunk hes got that soulja lean going on  matt is this with your gun  taliesin no this is sword  matt yeah  taliesin too close i knew they would jump so thats 22 and 24  laura i need more coffee  liam youre at your most dashing when you use your sword  
none	 taliesin yes you know thats 26 points of damage oh wait i get three attacks dont i  thats right  matt yeah because youre on fire dude  taliesin thats right 26 points of damage plus oh yeah that definitely hits plus eight more  points of damage  matt all right so as it emerges from the wall coming toward you you do this triple strike  against it and it manages to carve across part of its chest but its momentum is still strong and  both fists come to the side to hit you and rattle 
none	 you from both sides that is a 16  taliesin nope  matt misses and a 24  taliesin and that hits  matt so you manage to deflect one blow the other one clocks you on the side of the head that is 11  points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin yeah okay theres all the healing i just did its all gone  matt all right and now this fellow here is going to swoop over and slam the ground near pike  laura oh good she can attack him  matt the range on this is a 
none	 ten by tenfoot cube so hes going to do it before he gets in melee  range of her shes right there so as it glides toward her it slams the ground and the earth is  going to attempt to consume her she needs to make a dexterity saving throw  laura i want to do it  liam okay you do it  laura i should not have claimed this  travis with that dice  laura oh we dont add anything to it  liam it is a big seven  matt and with that the ground 
none	 consumes pike who is now buried blinded and restrained within  laura she was saving her action though  matt and with the rest of its movement its going to sink into the ground well say  counting yeah itll sink into the ground just out of range ill put it here just to mention  where it is but consider its not prone its underground  liam it means he gave it rum tongue  matt youre going to die tonight  laughter  travis with such dedication  matt this one here is going to swing back around 
none	  taliesin attack of opportunity  matt she already took one one reaction this one bursts out of the ground to leap towards you as it  emerges it looks up and sees you just within its range it does have a bit of a reach and it leaps  to go ahead and make two swings at you natural one you manage to pull back with the broom and it  swings wide and lands on the ground and its going to attempt to go with another uppercut in  your direction that is a 15  laura it 
none	 doesnt hit i put my foot on its fist and  matt laughs ding no effect on that and thats going to end its turn thats his full move all right  so that brings us to keyleth  marisha okay do i see trinket underground  matt you can sense trinket is currently buried  laura oh my god thank you so much  marisha jesus that scared the shit out of me  sam you said i want coffee and you got coffee  laura i know but i didnt think anybody was going to do it really

none	  it like a shoryuken clutching pike in your left arm as you land back on your elemental feet in  that space bringing both of you  marisha excited earth elemental grunting  travis answering grunts it sounds like a concrete mixer  matt all righty i believe that ends your turn  marisha i cant do anything else probably  matt pike can because its her turn  marisha but pike can so holding little pike like a voodoo doll like a flashlight  matt do things  laura that means she can still attack  matt she 
none	 can yeah  laura she cant see anything though  matt no she can now keyleth just pulled her out of the rubble and is holding her in front  laura no i mean theres nothing to attack in front of her  liam whats this thing on the ground  laura hes underground still  taliesin so theres two above ground but theyre behind her  marisha but im holding pike can she see  liam can you throw her  laura were holding a physical action so she has to be next to something in order to attack 
dung	 it  marisha oh  travis thats why mine didnt happen either  matt yeah she can do whatever she wants  liam and it would be an action to chuck her though right  matt yeah she already pulled her free with her action so  laura did you use all your movement  matt she did  marisha to get there  matt well actually you had ten more feet if you wanted to  laura can you get within ten feet of something five feet of something  matt no unfortunately no  liam i mean we 
none	 could drop her where the thing disappeared its still a crapshoot but its  better than nothing drop me on the ground keyleth  laura i want to be able to hit it if it comes up  marisha agreeing elemental grunts heavy thud  matt sets the gnome down on the ground that ends keyleths turn now its pikes go  liam okay she is going to still just hold her turn  laura oh man should she do a cantrip she should do a resistance or something  liam she could do it on herself just in case 
none	 yeah cast resistance on herself in case  laura but thats an action its not a bonus  liam instead shes going to look at the ground and go monstah and hold her mace  matt so shes holding her action to attack perfect percival youre up top of the round  taliesin im going to pull out the gun and take three shots at that thing thats swinging at vex  matt okay go for it  taliesin yeah oof thats close thats a 19  matt 19 hits  taliesin then the rest of them hit too its 
none	 like 21 and 20 so lets get some d10s out  marisha do you need some more  taliesin no i got enough some d10s and some d6s so here we go counting thats 12 points of  psychic damage  travis makes weird noise  taliesin i dont know what that was  liam there is weird energy at this table  matt okay the first shot as you reach over and fire at that one you hit it and you watch as it  scatters into stones across the far  taliesin ill put the first shot at 
none	 that and then shift the next two to the other one  matt yep they have the same ac  taliesin okay so thats seven points of psychic damage and 36 points of normal damage  matt to that one  taliesin yeah  matt okay as the second one does blast a large chunk out of its torso and side it still stands  there with its angered arms open ready to swing at whatever comes at it  taliesin okay im good  matt all right that ends percivals turn grog youre up  travis grunts can i

none	 laura thats what im going to be aiming at darling  travis second attack 26  matt that hits  travis 28 no 38  matt 38 okay as you stand over trinket the first hit cleaves into the center of its chest  and wedges itself there and you see the rocks forming over the axe almost trying to pull it  into its body to pull it from your grip and as you do instead you reach down and put your foot  onto its chest and yank it outward and as you do as most of it 
none	 began to form over the axe it  bisects it in two and it crumples into a pile of dirt on the ground  cheering  matt so you still have 45 feet of movement  travis should i run down this tunnel and see whats down here  marisha yeah  travis yeah  liam no no  laura hes raging he doesnt have logic  travis can i see him from wherever i am this enemy  matt yeah id say you can hes emerged you can see the movement  travis ill run up and join percy

none	  laura 19 oh and i didnt add plus 20 to both of those plus 20 overall because of the  sharpshooter  matt all right so with that as you see it crawling towards percival trying to grow and leap  at it and grog leaps up in its way theres a very little space where you can actually see its  movement and as you watch grog pull back with the axe to almost go for a secondary strike that  brief opening you see you have both arrows notched and releasing both at the same time and 
dung	 as  it does it sinks into both of the sockets where the dark void of its eyes were and it goes  creaking crashing and then falls into scattered pieces of rock  laura youre welcome  taliesin oh very nice  matt all right do you want to move or stay where you are  laura im going to stay  matt all right vax youre up  laura wait what about trinket can he try to save against it  matt ill say ill give you an action for trinket instead of an attack to attempt to 
none	 break free  make a strength check strength saving throw  laura i dont know what the difference for a saving throw for trinket would be  matt strength modifier  laura 15  matt 15 unfortunately cannot break free its not strong enough  laura can i hear him does he make noise  matt you listen and you hear the shifting of rock thats it  laura i dont even know its trinket do i  matt yeah you dont  laura i aim my bow at it  matt okay vax what are you doing  liam

none	 do this  cheering  travis pikey  laura she goes grog watch this  travis i cant see anything because a persons in the way  laura you can see youre big  liam she does an underswing right up between its legs and hits it in the goolies  matt as she does the glowing mace scatters upward breaking layer after layer of rock and  earth its upper torso explodes into the ceiling a shower of small pebbles and errant pieces of  earth are smeared across the wall and scatter to the ground  travis untamed 
none	 monster  liam she gives it three or four more hits on the ground out of frustration  laura yeah because she got trapped  liam yep  marisha i go rescue the bear  laura be careful i think theres another elemental right there  marisha are there any more  laura i think trinkets an elemental  matt as you guys all make your way over to the pile as its shifting and moving you all prepare  your weaponry for what might emerge make a perception check vex  laura oh no dont you make me attack 
none	 my own bear oh no 17  matt thats plenty the moment you see some of the movement push through a claw begins to emerge  from it and your arrow pulls back ready to release but the moment its there you  immediately wonder how you could have made that mistake  laura trinket i run  matt all of you rush over and begin to help trinket free  liam i place my hand on scanlans shoulder and say im sorry i know this is hard for you the  bear lives  sam and i say from 
none	 the top of the tree i dont know who youre touching but im up on top of a tree  liam im flying  sam im invisible  laughter  liam theres a lot of rules in this game staying on theme for the night  sam yes i know it lives for now i was holding my action i could blast the bear with my wand  she wouldnt even know where i was coming from  laura i would see you the minute you attacked  sam whispering oh shes right  laughter  matt so this battle 
none	 has transpired in the length of one stride of the titan as the other footfall  lands thumping one portion of the wall begins to shake and fall in and this side of the tunnel  begins to collapse  laura oh we got to take off we got to start moving  marisha keyleth blocks as much as she can and goes earth elemental speaking  laura run i think shes saying run  matt so as you guys dart down and head left into the hallway your earth elemental form allows you  with quite a bit of 
none	 strength to force it and prevent it from causing the entire tunnel to  collapse just half of it does and holding that in space you guys begin to charge down the left  side of the tunnel  laura as were running i cast pass without a trace again should i  liam sure sure  and i pat your big stony face and give it a kiss and fly down the hall  laura okay never mind i dont cast it  matt okay as you guys continue down the left path for about 50 or so feet 
dung	 it curves rapidly to  the left and stops at a cylindrical chamber its still a cavernous space but it has a cylindrical  shape to it about 40 feet in diameter about 50 feet tall at its apex and in the center of it  you see a partially collapsed dark stone pavilion or small temple  liam at the bottom in the middle  matt well you guys turn and its in the center of this chamber that rises up before you in the  center of this small eggshaped opening the space and you see this made 
dung	 of a deep dark  grayish almost black stone structure that looks beautifully made the craftwork is distinctly dwarven  laura is it old  matt you can go make an investigation check on it if youd like  liam im going to do divine sense again  matt okay  liam for undead  travis theyre everywhere  matt you do sense  liam specifically a location  matt specifically within the heart of this structure  laura is this no this is not mountain  travis laughs no  laura this is titan  travis laura voice is 
none	 this favored terrain  matt this would be considered subterranean it would be like an underground  laura okay so not underdark  matt not underdark no the structure however is somewhat damaged from a collapse on one side of  the wall you watch as part of the chamber on the right side has come loose and this rockslide has  jammed into the side of the structure and looking past the craggy piles of loose rock you can see  shattered glass across the ground and part of the rock as the rockslide has pushed into one of 
none	 these  glass panels that marks the exterior of the small gazebolike temple structure it seems to have  filled from what you can see at least at this distance a portion of the interior as well there  is a double door in the front that is currently closed and the right side of the door is buried  partially by the remainder of this rockslide that has come to a halt at the base of the structure  laura do we know what gods dwarves worshipped do they have specific gods  matt make a religion check  
none	 liam these are dead dwarves  pike starts whispering i can technically destroy dead things so if we sneak me up to the  outside of the wall  laura five  matt i mean you ran into the allfathers space before but not every dwarf worships the  allfather just like any other free race in the world religions up for grabs  taliesin knowing the history of this city would we know what this is  matt you dont know what this is at first glance the structure seems ceremonial or at least  important  it seems 
none	 to have been placed here with intent away from a large part of society  taliesin its not a crypt or anything like that or a very expensive crypt  matt it could be  travis do we see the inside of the gazebotype structure  liam how big is it too  matt how big is it its about maybe id say 35 feet wide it almost fills the entirety of the  chamber theres like a slight space behind it except for the fact that part of the wall  collapsed into it and is burying the right 
none	 side of the structure  travis colored glass  matt looking at the glass its multiple colors looks to be of stained glass type and its a  thick glass and there is one intact window of stained glass on the opposite side and there is  the double doors currently that keep it shut  taliesin is there an image on the stained glass is it depicting something  matt it looks to depict a dwarvishlike figure adorned in golden armor that stands at the  precipice of a mountain with a series of smaller dwarflike entities in shadow 
none	 all around looking  up at it its very simple when you get up close to it but the further back you go its a  beautiful arrangement  taliesin i bet its a crypt which means that its trapped and i bet that means theres  something expensive and interesting inside  liam dm question  matt yes  liam because i cant remember for sure didnt in our story somewhere we come up with a solution  for pikes noisiness something that quieted her down  laura she had stealth boots  matt yes her boots they gave 
none	 her advantage on stealth which meant that she just made a regular roll  liam regular roll  matt yes  marisha we made her that armor that we never went back and picked up because we fucked up  laura yeah but it doesnt matter because shes got the dawnmartyr  liam she casts guidance on herself to help with that roll  travis im with you i think this thing has a yield  taliesin yeah im feeling it  sam break all the glass go inside  marisha i touch the ground still in my earth elemental 
none	 form do i sense anything tremor sense  any vibrations  matt you feel for it nothing in the immediate vicinity however another footfall hits from the titan and  it causes the entirety of the chamber to quake and its almost like you know when superman opens up  his perception too wide and hears all the voices  marisha yep mmhmm  matt everything around you shakes with such an intense ferocity it causes your head to shake briefly  liam i have another dm question  matt yes  liam for paladins until the end of your 
none	 next turn you know the location of any undead within  60 feet so that implies number  matt correct  liam if i know the location of any so how many am i sensing  matt one  liam one okay  laura do you know where can you sense where it is  matt its in the center of this structure  liam center  taliesin all right lets do this  marisha oh okay  laura you want to fight it  taliesin i bet theres something really nice inside  liam also i mean if pike 
none	 can get up and get a peek in she could take a first shot at turning  it turnt stay turnt  marisha so there are the double doors and then its a cavein on one side  matt on one side and its broken one of two sets of stained glass on the front of it and it seems  to have filled part of the interior currently there isnt enough space in that window to climb  in its filled with rock you could try and move stuff out of the way or go through the doors or 
none	  break the other windows those are the only types of entrance you can find  laura and theres no other exit from this cylindrical chamber  matt that you see no  laura okay  liam i wonder if getting pike on the broom or the rug could improve her chances of sneaking up to  the door as well and get a peek in and try to turn whatevers inside  laura oh i mean we could try it ill put pike on the broom  liam okay  laura and well fly over to the side of 
none	 the cavein  marisha i can just earth glide under and peek up  laura yeah but she can turn undead  travis but how many times can she do that in a day is that a pull the trigger and once do we  want to waste it on something  laura as an action  liam unlimited  laura as an action  travis okay  matt its an action  marisha is it a spell  liam no  travis i mean it could be an undead  matt a channel divinity is that what youre talking 
none	 about  laura yeah  taliesin it just works  laura oh wait you can use your channel divinity twice between rests  liam okay so she can do that shes got a couple of other things she can do with this ability  laura and is she 18th level  liam shes 18th level  laura ooh so now she can do it three times between rests  liam its worth a shot because we could oneshot a thing possibly  matt shes 17th right now oh no i think she just leveled up ill double check no because 
none	  you just hit 18th  sam i just hit 18th  matt yep so shes still 17th  liam possible one shot  travis might just be a dwarven king  taliesin lets see what happens  sam lets do it  matt let me double check  marisha probably is hes just undead now  laura so we should try to get her in and turn him  taliesin yeah  laura okay yeah lets do that  travis or hes totally encased by the material and if we unearth him  marisha it could be bad  
none	 travis yep  marisha or hes unearthed and yeah he could be blocking a  travis let sleeping dogs lie  marisha yeah  laura percy really wants to find treasure  taliesin well which is always a bad sign but there it is  travis yeah lets do this  sam in what realm of possibility are we not going into this thing  laura well we could just turn around and walk away and find our way up to the city  sam have we ever done that  travis go check that door before i do  
none	 laura all right  liam you guys go everybody hang back  taliesin check for traps  liam yeah do i spot anything here comes the roll  laura okay okay okay im going to cast pass without a trace on us now  taliesin im keeping my distance and pulling out the rifle and im pointing if anything needs  shooting im going to shoot it  marisha im going to be with him by this door  matt so you  liam checking for traps investigation right 20  matt all right so 20 as you go towards 
none	 the door you can look around and see the door before  you its partially buried and it isnt locked but you can see there are some runic carvings  along the perimeter of the doorway similar to what you saw earlier on the pieces of stone when  you first entered and there are signs of forced entry it looks like there are parts of the stone  that have been chipped familiar to you from people that use crowbars or other materials to  break into entry places it looks like there have been signs of forced entry 
none	 in the past  liam however theres still an undead thing inside  marisha it could just be a fight deplete us down  liam but i dont find any traps  matt you do not find any traps in the door no  laura it could just be a fight to take away our stuff before we go to a bigger fight  marisha correct  matt all you find is the door on the left appears to be unlocked and you could possibly push it  open and you see the dwarven writing on the outside of the 
none	 wall  liam sighs  marisha ah come on were running out of time  travis what are we fucking pretending like  laura yeah fine  liam can we see well can pike can i see into the hovel  matt do you want to push the door open and have a look inside  liam oh its closed  matt the door is closed you can see  travis oh hold on hold on there are runes of which i can read  marisha oh five minutes go by and  travis dont knock it all right just 
none	 be grateful can i try to take a look at the  dwarvish  matt you may  travis yeah  matt it takes you roughly 15 or so minutes  laura oh my god come on we cannot wait for 15 minutes  liam vaxs wings go poof  matt yeah the wings vanish you can take a short rest if you guys would like to  laura while hes doing that  travis im professor x  matt itll take a while so it means you lose your invisibility  marisha i mean might as well  matt 
none	 all right so you guys can take your hit dice as a short rest your form reverts which if you  wanted to try and peek within you couldnt anyway because its worked stone so you cant glide through that  the words you pull out from this are the last king stalwart warrior of our mountain  secrets his might unmatched his will unbroken his passing invites the madness  travis shit okay all right its been worth the wait it is the last king theres like a secret  buried with him and his death brought on the 
none	 madness so like theres definitely treasure with  him down there  marisha unless its already been raided  taliesin i think hes still in there and hes maybe been turning people mad  that would be my guess  liam the last king  sam theres a king in there  laura what say it again  travis hes the last king theres like the secret with  matt stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets  sam mountain dwarf  marisha stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets  liam when im turning undead if theyre like little piddly guys 
none	 they blow up but if hes a  king he might not blow up  taliesin okay then we can  liam so he might get scared of me or nothing i dont know  sam laughs double pike is the best pike  matt grog you do not get a short rest unfortunately  travis nope  matt because you were studying  travis thank you im working real hard  sam hey for hit point counts here im under the impression that we had some bonus hit points from  some speech or something do we heal those 
none	 as well  taliesin no  marisha yes  taliesin oh you do  marisha yeah its plus 18 to your maximum hit points  matt no no no thats from heroes feast  sam which we did not do  marisha oh im sorry its just temporary hit points  matt its temporary hit points from your speech  marisha but you dont get them back right right okay  travis when theyre gone theyre gone  marisha then yeah  travis what do you think should we dig him up or move on  sam time is of 
none	 the essence  liam well time is of the essence he could have something useful it seems like a coin flip  travis it says he has a secret with him right like a secret a prize  matt all it says is stalwart warrior of our mountain secrets  travis oh yeah a stow of our mountain secrets  liam thats tempting liam said  laura you should open the door  liam yeah of course  laura you should open the door  liam yeah all right so  taliesin we are nasty enough that if we have 
none	 to put this thing down we put this thing down  liam pickle are you ready to go yeah okay shhh im going to try and open it  as silent as possible  matt make a strength check  liam strength check  matt its a heavy stone door  liam good grief  matt partially buried in rubble its not locked but it is somewhat  liam 16  matt 16  liam yeah  matt for you is pike helping  laura yeah  liam yeah sure  matt have pike roll as well her strength is 
none	 19 so its 4 to what she rolls  laura 16  matt okay you both grunting it shifts like a quarter inch and then locks into place from  something  liam enough to see in  matt no the doors are about that thick  liam grog  travis and i walk up and fucking hammer that shit  laura no grog  liam pike goes like this yells as soon as the door opens  matt all right go ahead and roll an attack  taliesin titanstone knuckles  travis yeah double damage  marisha yeah  
none	 liam i mean as soon as pike sees him flex shes got her hands  laura ready to turn undead  travis 17  matt all right so go ahead and roll damage well say 1d4 for your fists  plus your strength modifier  travis ten  matt ten so thats 20 points of damage because its doubled as you slam your fist into the stone  door the door cracks and part of it splinters and falls toppling past your  shoulders and bouncing you in the head a bit the door suffered severe damage and probably wouldnt 
none	  sustain another blow  marisha i mean  taliesin go ahead  travis fee fi fo fum  matt laughs roll an attack again  travis that is a 15  matt 15 yeah thats enough thats just enough you slam a second time you dont have to roll  damage even with the additional modifier its enough the door crumbling crumples inward and  falls inside the actual chamber as your fist turns it into shattered rock and dust  laura can pike see undead in there  matt make a perception check  travis ill make a 
none	 perception check too im at the doorway  laura plus 11 20  matt okay  taliesin natural 20  matt okay as you guys glance inside briefly this tenfoot wide well its actually more like a  sixfoot wide door side on this point glancing inside its another circular chamber thats like  an outer hallway maybe five feet wide six feet wide and an interior chamber it looks like a  smaller cylinder on the inside that is currently locked you dont see anything within there you  see to the right immediately the rockslide has filled most 
none	 of the chamber and comes to rest just  about the corner of a single large antique bronze door thats pushed into this central chamber about  15 feet wide  liam vax catches pikes shoulder hold on let me look  matt you glance off to your left and you can see along the other side there are five pedestals  that curve around this side each containing a stone box about that big on each pedestal  taliesin what  matt otherwise all around the ground here are broken rocks and shattered statue bits from the  rockslide 
none	 they pushed it inside its a mess across the ground from the impact of the  rockslide so what are you guys doing  liam im checking the boxes for traps and the door  laura can we see anything that points to what deity it is from inside the chamber can we see  anything  matt glancing around you cant make another religion check on one youve already failed  laura oh yeah no  matt so you dont see anything that comes across as religious iconography  laura what about pike though because shes looking in  
none	 matt sure make a religion check for pike  taliesin feel you i feel you  liam plus seven  laura 13  matt 13 no religious iconography seems to catch your attention what did you roll for the  liam 19 for the investigation  matt 19 for the investigation  liam the door and boxes  matt okay glancing at the first box it does not appear to be locked it does  appear to be trapped  liam okay here we go  laura youre going to try to undo the trap  matt yep so go 
none	 ahead and make a roll your dexterity and your proficiency modifier  liam thieves tool yeah thats fine  travis should we clear out of here while you work on this bomb  liam yeah  travis were all going to get out of the chamber  matt okay so you all clear out of the chamber  liam 30  matt 30 okay you find theres actually a pressure cartridge at the very top of the box so you slip  your dagger in so it remains depressed as you lift the lid you put your thumb over it 
none	 and hold  it trap never triggers looking inside its empty  liam shutting noise  matt shutting noise no problem  liam just go down the line  matt all right investigation check on the next one  travis five of them on pedestals  laura groans luck  liam yeah  laura okay good  taliesin oh yeah  liam laughs thats a 29  matt you rolled a 29  liam with luck  matt okay this one is not locked is trapped  liam okay here we go thats fine thats a 27  matt 27 
none	 okay similar depression plate so the dagger opens it up its empty  liam i did one two lets jump to five  matt okay go for it  laura are you making sure nothings invisible in there  liam no are you here  laura im peeking in the door  liam did you whisper it to me  laura yeah  liam they dont relock when i go  laura theyre not locking  liam my sisters hounding me at the door so im going to go back and twiddle my finger inside the  empty boxes  
none	 laura you were shutting them as you went  liam yeah but i can reopen them they dont relock do they  laura its not that they were locked they were trapped  liam but retrap i mean  matt they are retrapped but youve already known the traps  liam so ill go do this inside  matt nothing  laura just wanted to double check  liam i go to box five  matt okay  liam oh thats great yeah that works that was investigation and its 26  matt 26 its not locked it is trapped 
none	  liam that is a 33 yeah  matt 33 similar trap setup different placement of the depression plate on the inside of the box  lid you find it hold it open it up empty  laura ah its all empty  taliesin two more  liam two more  liam lets go to box number three theres three and four left  matt okay  laura i look over at percy it makes me far too uncomfortable how excited you are about this  taliesin this could be very good  liam 18  matt 18 all right 
none	 you check it is not locked it is not trapped  groaning  laura oh no oh no you rolled too low  matt okay you lift the lid putting the dagger where the other depressions were  liam im leaning back  matt as you pull it back theres a cloud explosion of a purplishblack cloud of some sort  of vapor that immediately bursts into your face make a constitution saving throw  laura its okay well its not okay hes got better constitution  liam good 20  matt 20 you manage to just in time hold 
none	 your breath and what bit gets into your lungs your body  instinctually pushes against your semiliving form pushes the toxins from your system  you only suffer  laura 75 points of poison damage  matt no you only suffer eight points of poison damage  taliesin ah there you go  liam lets do one more  taliesin anything in the box  matt box is empty  taliesin last box  travis you are not doing this to us  liam 19  matt 19 not locked not trapped  taliesin hold your breath  travis look 
none	 at his eyes look at his eyes  liam yeah im going to hold my breath and wait wait wait  sam need some help in there  liam okay heres what im going to do i  take up whisper and i go unlocking  wind blowing and throw it at the wall  matt okay so you throw whisper and pull the lid up  liam yep  matt as you pull the lid up trap triggers the same toxic fume emanates from it but you are not  there in the space instead appearing right next to 
none	 the central cylindrical platform in the center of the  chamber and look back and the cloud slowly dissipates around the lid has now fallen back  into place  travis aw shit  marisha that was hot  liam i walk over to it finger swirling sound  matt well the lid fell back in place  liam oh i did that to the top i open it up finger swirling sound  matt okay you open it up make a constitution saving throw  liam yes  matt as it cloud explosion sprays in the air  liam 
none	 it does it again it didnt expend  matt these dont  liam i wouldve thought thered be a little container  matt they reset when they close  liam with what are there a bunch of gnomes down there  taliesin its like a paintball gun  matt its like theres magic in the world liam that allows you to fly 400 feet a round  liam im just going to take it a 14 thats not good enough  matt no its not good enough oh no actually 14 is just what you needed  laura oh  
none	 matt so you resist it again pained noise you still that is only six points of poison damage  liam im fine im fine i cough  matt but you resist the poison from locking into your system  laura thats good  matt the box is empty  laura the box is empty was it worth it  taliesin whats in the center  liam i feel alive of what of the room  matt the bronze door  sam the gift was the adventure  taliesin i think thats where the good shit was i think this was 
none	 just to take people out  matt you get the sense looking around here based on the forced entry that theres probably a good  chance this place had already been pilfered of whatever those boxes contained  liam you never know they couldve died trying and then walked away undead  sam so theres literally nothing in here or theres still a sarcophagus  laura theres a center cylinder  matt theres the rockslide shattered statues across the ground theres the empty boxes on the  pillars and theres the bronze doorway  laura there is an undead thing 
none	 maybe one undead guy got stuck in the middle  sam so we should open the bronze door right  travis yeah  laura you know what scanlan you should probably bamf inside and see  sam i could  travis do it  sam okay  laura no no im joking  travis no no no do it  sam ill go inside and ill open the door  travis yeah  taliesin the door just opens on it  sam is it locked  matt you go ahead and inspect the door  liam ask your rogue dude 
none	  matt so as you go and take a moment and check the door there is a bronze image faintly carved  into it of a stocky dwarven man with a thick beard that touches his toes it completely covers the  front of his body he wears plated armor that comes to dangerous jagged curvedup points as  far as dwarves go this one looks about as unhappy and unapproachable as any dwarf and youve  encountered some pretty gnarly dwarves in your time as you glance down there does appear to be  an opening for a key 
none	 and there is an oval turning mechanism like a vault door  like a smaller vault  sam im going to check for traps  matt make an investigation check  sam i think its 20  matt 20 it does not appear to be trapped  travis look at that face  liam do you mind if i give a second opinion  sam sure  liam you know what could it hurt oh not that good though no lower than what you rolled  laura oh shit theres no traps  liam its okay youre good now  
none	 travis we need a key though  matt does appear to be locked though  sam oh yeah maybe you should pick the lock  travis we need a key let me try my  laura no lets just pick his for this  liam natural 20  matt to  liam pick it  matt pick the lock okay  laura im not in this room  taliesin im in the back ready  liam pike is though shes been doing this for five minutes  matt okay so you and pike youre in the back of the room 
none	  taliesin im right by the door  matt whats everyone doing  travis and laura outside the door  marisha yeah im outside waiting for a call  sam im right next to him  matt all right so its a total of what  liam total of 37 im a level 18 rogue  matt i know  taliesin who just rolled a natural 20  matt on a lockpick dc of 30 you manage to somehow find the intricacy of a king dwarf  sarcophagus sealed door it takes you a good two to three minutes to 
none	 carefully find the proper  tumblers and hold them without it breaking or ruining the lock but you manage to feel something  shift and a slight latch mechanism on the other side go creaking at which point the brass door  from the front doors jaw goes door opening and pours forth this green fume that fills the entirety of  the chamber scanlan pike and vax i need you and you because youre still in  the back of the chamber  taliesin im by the door though  liam but youre inside  matt you said you 
none	 were back in the chamber by the door its on the outskirt i need you all to make  a constitution saving throw please  travis its like we kept asking for it  marisha i know  sam 18 for me  marisha keyleth is in the back facepalming right about now  taliesin 19  liam 25  matt okay  laura seven  matt seven okay you manage to shrug off whatever this effect the fume is and you all cough  for a second as it dissipates scanlan percival and pike you feel your joints begin 
none	 to stiffen  you feel your skin begin to tighten and as you guys try and shift and look around your whole  body moves sluggishly the outside of your body seems to harden and begin to shift in place you  suddenly begin to wonder those shattered statue pieces in the ground may have been the last tomb  robbers who came through here as you all begin to realize this and the fume begins to slowly fade  from the chamber the rest of you scared to enter i need you to make another constitution  saving throw 
none	  travis whoa  laura oh my god  matt not you vax youve already made it but i need pike percy and scanlan to make another  marisha can keyleth do any type of wind gust to try and push this away to help  matt if youd like to  marisha but ahead of time  matt the effect has already taken place on them its not going to stop it unless they save but  you can try and clear the chamber of the fume  marisha ill go ahead and clear the chamber so they dont 
none	 have to do this again  matt all right so what are you using to do that  marisha wind gust  matt its a 1stlevel correct  matt so you clear the fume dissipates out and up into the chamber and you diffuse it enough where  it doesnt seem to have as concentrated an effect  liam could you say that vax saw the look of panic in pikes eyes and blessed her in a split second  marisha gust of wind 2ndlevel spell sorry  matt i will say sure ill let that happen  sam but 
none	 you wont let me cast greater restoration  matt you can if you want to  sam i will cast greater restoration  matt on yourself  sam on pike  matt on pike okay as you reach out and cast greater restoration it infuses pikes body and  the hardening effect fades  sam but i have to roll another constitution  matt you and percival both  laura so pike is  sam 13  marisha 13 is not good oh fucking hell  taliesin im going to blow a resolve thatll be fun because that was bullshit 
none	 18  matt as pike shrugs off the effect and the gust of wind clears the rest of the green fume from the  chamber you all look back and watch as locked in place frozen stone percival and scanlan now adorn  the chamber like decorative statues locked in an expression of  laura pike runs over and casts greater restoration on scanlan  marisha and i cast greater restoration on percy  matt okay so mark off those spells cast for both of you and upon touch each of you your form  reverts back and the flesh 
none	 and color returns  to your body  marisha can we please stop robbing tombs and get back to our actual mission  sam im stuck like this  laura no youre not  sam it didnt work oh god  laura scanlan no youre not  taliesin i put my finger in his ear  travis shit we just blew those  marisha can we go  matt the doors open and the jaw is not resetting its expended at the time you dont  know how long it will take for it to reset and you do recognize 
none	 this is one of those type of  traps that does reset over time you just dont know how much time you have  liam too bad i didnt recognize the last one  matt nope  taliesin do we want to open it we paid for it  liam its open  taliesin its open whats inside  liam pickle come on  laura she gets ready  matt beyond the door indeed you find the tomb of the last king in this cylindrical chamber with  plain stone walls in the center you see a single solid marble 
none	 rectangular sarcophagus with no lid  it is open before you within you see the mummified skeleton of a dwarf adorned in golden  decorative armor the same shape and design that you saw on the bronze doorway before you entered  an intricate hammer made of jet black metal rests to one side outside of its grasp and a beautiful  gray leather belt of square opals wraps around the center of its body at which point the skull goes  crackling  laura she casts turn undead  liam she grabs her holy symbol and flips it the 
none	 bird and turns undead  matt okay as she holds up the holy symbol the might of sarenrae swells within her and blasts  forth in a shockwave of divine energy and will whats her dc  liam wisdom saving throw dc oh shit so many pieces of paper 18  matt 18 as the wave blasts past it sits up seemingly unaffected by the effect growls it  looks like its coming to you have one round what are you guys doing  liam one round  travis were not in there  matt nope the rest of you 
none	 are out its one round before it seems to be its currently  sitting up in the sarcophagus its arms reaching out for the hammer at its side  liam im going to fill up with three daggers and dump divine smite into the first  sam take its weapons  matt all right pike also still has her mace  laura yeah so she should do that  marisha am i in there from the gust  matt no you guys are still outside of the chamber they rushed in after healing each other  and besides its a 
none	 small room theres only room for three people to get in there  what are you doing  laura pikes going to rush in as hes doing that and try to rip the hammer away from the body and  run out of the room  matt interesting okay so first you do your attack  liam 32 19 32  matt the first and the third hit  liam okay first and third hit sneak attack on the first because assassin and im going to dump  smite into it three plus eight let me get the dice first 
none	 counting 41 and the smite is 3d8  because its undead i said 41 right 41 45 46 52 doubled is 104 plus the psychic damage 109  for the first attack  matt so pike doesnt have much of a fight for the hammer because you watch as daggers jam into  the ornamental armor causing it to bend and twist inward ruining the breastplate and the undead  king falls apart and before it can sit up is now sitting right back down in the sarcophagus  laura shes like well  taliesin take everything  laura check 
none	 for traps because weve been there darling weve been there  marisha take his belt  laura check for fucking traps how about nobody dies  liam bad experience with coffins  travis it really didnt go that poorly last time  sam im going to check the floor for any pressure plates or anything okay thats a lot 30  matt 30  liam 22 for my investigation  matt okay the sarcophagus itself is not trapped nothing of the accoutrements appear to be trapped  as youre investigating the floor plates to the immediate right and left of 
none	 the sarcophagus to  where someone would easily wish to reach in there are two plates that are trapped  sam just work from the floor or from the  matt from the front yeah its a very small space its meant that if more than one person  were to or if you were to fill the chamber the two sides would trigger  taliesin lets get what we need and get out  liam oh no you can fly over  taliesin before it resets  matt the bronze plate armor is ruined its decorative it appears to 
dung	 be more for visual and  presentation than actual function so you grab the dark hammer and the belt then you pull out of the  chamber the jaw of the open bronze is slowly creaking sound  laura get out  matt you guys exit the chamber youre now outside of the cylindrical tomb of the last king  travis that was a lot of action what did you get  laura i found a hammer grog is it cursed can we tell if its cursed can we tell if its bad  liam you might be feeling some 
none	 issues right now if it were cursed  matt anyone have an identify spell  sam she might be able to sense good and evil no  laura i dont know  sam or is that for creatures not for thats for creatures  liam i could detect good and evil  laura yeah here  matt its creatures  travis gimme  sam i can look at it and just look at it ill look at it  laura does it feel magic  matt make an arcana check if youre looking at it sorry  sam just looking 
none	 12  laura we suck  matt its interesting its not so much that you can see any sort of theres no runic  ornamentation it seems on it but its like a deep jet black metal make a history check  marisha does it look like the same black metal as in the tomb  sam 22  matt 22 this is adamantine which is an extremely rare and hard metal  sam wolverine  matt its the fantasy equivalent its not technically magically enchanted but its nature  makes it a very powerful weapon by the metal that 
none	 its crafted from  marisha the hammer  matt the hammer  travis is it a twohanded weapon singlehanded  matt its a warhammer so its onehanded  travis im just saying  sam whats your hammer like  travis my dwarven thrower it can be single or doublehanded its not a warhammer it flies back  to my hand though  sam oh thats pretty cool  travis it is but you can never have enough hammers do you mind if i  sam no but i mean how are you going to wield this you have two other 
none	 weapons dont you  travis are you kidding me im like a fucking home depot of weapons i got what you need  sam sure go for it  laura what about the belt  matt the belt make an arcana check  sam let me look at that i have no idea what that is  travis just because i want to know can i go up to the doorway and hit the side of the doorway  with the adamantine black hammer  matt it does require attunement to use its effect or power  laura oh it 
none	 needs attunement  travis yeah without attuning i just hit the doorway  matt okay its solid its hefty its nice one of the better hammers youve ever wielded  travis its solid its hefty its one of the better hammers ive ever wielded  sam are you going to unattune from something to attune to this  travis no  laura just to have it  sam then what is it  travis bag of holding  laura this is totally worth it we dont know what any of this shit is  taliesin we dont know let me 
none	 take a look at that belt maybe wait you have to be trained in  arcana to identify something dont you  matt i would say for the most part yeah  taliesin is there anybody else trained in arcana  matt i mean you can make a base check to give a glance but youre not going to be able to learn  much about the nature of any enchantment if you find one  taliesin does 23 do anything  matt i will say looking at it there does appear to be runes inscribed very faintly in parts 
none	 of the  leather around it and the way the rectangular opals are set into it there is a glimmer of some  sort of enchantment based into it  taliesin i want to attune to it and see what happens  marisha we have to take another short rest  taliesin next time yeah lets get a little further  sam next time were about to go fight fucking vecna  taliesin i mean were on our way but weve got a lot further to go  sam well that was fruitful lets keep going  travis all right 
none	 lets go back to the other way  taliesin i think im going to try the belt on and see what happens  travis yeah do it  liam fred  marisha while were walking  liam freddie  taliesin its obviously enchanted it doesnt  sam who would be buried with a cursed belt  travis absolutely you would yep thats exactly what you would do with it  sam i think its a great idea were gods now we can do anything we want  marisha i mean we have pulled cursed items out of tombs before  
none	 sam they havent permanently killed any of us  marisha sure  laura you can do what  liam i wasnt going to say i could do anything i think thats a shitty idea right now  marisha we really need to keep moving  travis we travel back down the  laura yeah the other fucking direction  matt all right so you head the other way so youre holding off  taliesin no i want to find out so im going to pull the gloves off and im going to put the belt on  matt okay so 
none	 you begin to attune to it as you guys are walking take some time with it  taliesin and marisha i hope its great  matt following the right path you continue for roughly 100 or so feet in a switchback motion  once youre past that portion of the tunnel it seems to curve back and it ascends in like a  switchback path a bit you can see at this point more stairs more carved stone steps are beginning  to emerge some of the rough earth that you had encountered in previous tintersections seems to  be 
none	 falling away to some semblance of actual holding architecture and eventually it reveals a  much larger hall of very apparent dwarven architecture the ceiling now pulls up to about 60  feet above you stalagmites dripping condensation from the shadow above you can hear the distant  drops in the distance of the cavern before you you can make out broken ruins built into the walls  of each side ancient stone homes and structures that now crack and crumble with each footfall of  the titan as you hear the impact of the next heavy footfall you see 
none	 as a couple of stones  tumble from some of these structures clattering across the cavern floor  liam and matt perception check  liam natural 20  matt vax you hear a faint distant echoing alien sound in the darkness ahead of you  liam farish  matt further than your visual range  liam further than my visual range okay weve got company up ahead so yeah  marisha what kind of an alien language any that we recognize  matt you hear this faint sounds like a voice droning slightly changing pitch but its so  disparate 
town	 and so distant that you cant make up anything other than noticing that it exists  amongst the steady low rhythmic rumbles of each separate footfall of the beast you now currently  are within  travis vax go fetch  liam stealth  matt all right make a stealth check  liam 30  matt okay as you dart ahead you come up a few steps onto a raised thoroughfare amongst the  various dwarven buildings here it looks like there is a crevasse or chasm that this portion of  the city was built along and you can 
town	 see up above there were platforms where staircases would rise up and there  were raised buildings built into these chambers that have since fallen and crumbled down with the  movement of the titan leaving these ruined piles of broken walls floors and decorative materials  you can see broken and bent dinnerware and metallic decorative plates or vases that have  since fallen and crumbled beneath the collapsing structures there was once a thriving city that  youre now getting more glimpses of the further into this beast you go that has been long deserted  and now 
town	 the longer it travels it begins to be erased by the vibrations of the creatures  movement as you continue forward you can see theres a portion where the couldnt wait could you  travis the damn growl i thought it was a growl  laura and matt it sounded like a growl  liam man i had to pee so bad i ran out of the room  matt i know as you crest the top of this upper area of the road you glance down and can see a  portion of it is underwater theres a small 
none	 pool where droplets drop and at the edge of it you can  barely see the shape of a creature hunched at the edge of the waterside  liam how close am i to that  matt its about 50 to 55 feet from you  liam divine sense  matt okay divine sense to see if  liam its undead  matt it is not undead you do not get an undead sense  liam okay or a fiend or a celestial  matt its too far away to get a close view at this point because its at 
none	 the edge of your  darkvision you can just make out its shape its humanoid it has two arms two legs and it looks  roughly the size of you or vex but you now see its sitting at a fallen and partially ruined  dwarven statue some sort of structure that was on a pedestal that had fallen at the edge and its  sitting over top of it its got gray splotchy skin tough exterior armored spines or plates  along its back that stick up as it hunches forward like some sort of porcupine  laura does 
none	 it look like that thing in the nine hells that we saw or in the city of brass  matt not quite its smaller than that you see a collection of odd trinkets and objects that dangle  around its waist that clink as it shifts and moves like a belt of scavenged trophies its claws currently  tear into some sort of unidentified fleshy limb it has clawed fingers its digging into it tears  a piece of flesh off of it and chews and slurps it back it suddenly freezes up  liam daggers whooshing one two three 
none	  all oh  matt roll for an attack  marisha what if hes nice what if hes that random creepy merchant you find in the  middle of nowhere  travis nobody that eats with their hands in the inside of a titan is nice  liam advantage on all three attacks first attack is 29  matt okay that hits  liam second attack  sam hes just a nice old man  liam second attack is 32 third attack is 27  matt that hits  laura gentle old man impression thank god youre here ive been 
none	  taliesin theres no throat left  marisha rugged voice would you like to see my wares  travis ive been freed from my  sam gravelly voice dont go in the crypt of  laughter  matt so the first dagger does  liam ten 14 17 23 24 48 plus psychic damage 54 for the first attack  matt the two daggers hit nothing as the first dagger strikes and slaughters the creature and  hits the water and now floats up unmoving in the pond there you can see the liquid around it  darkening  taliesin 
none	 you just killed an npc  liam were not in emon in the market square  matt no one knows about this the sheer force of the first dagger sends it off the broken statue  and it falls into the water and it is now unmoving  liam we are in hell perception check  travis all we know is youre just out there  matt you guys do hear this distant echoing creature dying that echoes throughout the  chamber  liam 31  matt okay you glance around nothing else seems to be moving in the chamber 
none	  liam all right im going to sneak up to it  matt okay you move up to it you can see now its hunched in the water its face is under the  ground the water itself is maybe waist deep at most and its there floating in the liquid  sam it was holding a baby  liam flame tongue is out what am i looking at  matt do you want to look at its face  liam yeah  matt okay as you pull one of the spines and pull it back you can see toothy 
none	 jaws humanoidlike  but grey and coming to a point where you can see jagged teeth in the top and bottom row and one  singular large yellowish eye in the center of its face no nose and the eye is  slightly rolled back  liam liam knows what this thing is but vax does not fuck this thing im going to start looking  what are the trinkets on it  matt make an investigation check  laura you dont know what matt wouldve done with whatever you think  liam oh he could do anything  marisha 
none	 yeah clarota was nice  liam was he did you say investigation or perception  matt investigation  liam investigation all right thank you some weird energy tonight guys 19  matt 19 okay a lot of them appear to be bones many of them ancient and a couple of them look to  be more fresh theres a filthencrusted dagger thats hanging from the side an empty scroll  case a spyglass half of a book that looks like its old and rotten and falling apart and a  singular bronze key  liam i rip off the spyglass 
dung	 and go oh that looks nerdy percy will like that and then i yank off  the dagger and go that looks all right and i stick it in the blinkback belt and then what was  the last thing it was a key to the bronze door right yeah  matt looking at the shape and size of it it probably would have fit pretty  snugly into that door  liam in the dark by myself oh that is fucking hilarious  travis no book  liam the tattered remains of the book eh  matt you dont 
town	 recognize the language  liam eh i dont i let it sink back into the water  matt okay well its still floating  travis vax what did you find up ahead  liam a one eyed one horned swimming purple people come on up please  we should keep moving  travis all right we join him  matt all right you guys approach carefully walking through the center of this twisting chasm  you come over the rise of the central road and descend to meet up with vax where you see there  was the pool and 
none	 the floating creature  laura eww what is that do any of us know what it was  taliesin am i starting to get a vibe or am i not starting to get a vibe  matt of  taliesin the belt  matt oh the belt okay id say at this point sure  taliesin starting to get a vibe  matt sure  sam ooh  marisha is it vibey  taliesin it says okay  laura read it out loud  sam i dont even know how to pronounce that first word  taliesin the attuned gains

town	 travis oh man thats going to be a good talks later  laughter  travis not that we heard anything about what you just did  liam you might have seen a corpse in the water floating  travis i dont pay attention to that shit  matt all right  laura i wanted to look in the chamber and see if there was anything else interesting before we  walked out  matt there are a number of dwarven buildings in the vicinity some are partially or completely  collapsed some had fallen from outcroppings and platforms that have 
none	 since fallen into the center  of the chamber  travis its almost as if this room is meant to introduce something  taliesin stop it  matt you rolled a perception it was  laura i didnt roll it  matt you didnt roll yet thats right you did  liam to perceive a dead body in the water  laura 29  matt 29 glancing about theres the continuation of the path the chasm seems to be pinching a bit  the further forward you go its closing in you see six dwarven households or structures that  
none	 could be entered that look structurally enough sound that theyre standing  laura do they look rich  matt from this perspective everything looks pretty wrecked  laura okay were in a hurry right im not going to go search for stuff  matt all right continuing forward the floor continues to ascend upward as you reach the edge  of where the earth begins to meet to that pinch at the edge of the chasm and there the tunnel  continues anew there are stairs that continue for about 25 or 30 feet beyond as you ascend to those 
none	  steps they begin to vanish beneath more loose earth and stone for another 20 or so feet before  reemerging again in places about 40 feet past that the tunnel ends at a set of heavy stone  eightfoot doors the surrounding cavern has slid in places but it doesnt appear to be burying the  door to a certain extent theyre just closed you dont see any handles you dont see any  keyhole entry point theyre just two stone slabs theyre simple theyre smooth theres no  intricate scrolling theres no dwarven text theyre just impeding your 
none	 progress  liam lets have a look  laura yeah ill look around  matt investigation check  liam oh terrible  laura 21  liam 18  matt okay there does not appear to be any locking mechanism there doesnt appear to be any  traps around it theyre just two stone slabs that are jammed together  laura no hinges no nothing  matt no  travis clears throat  liam yes greg  travis no i just had a tickle in my throat  laura did you want to smash your way through this very loudly  
none	 travis oh did you want me to smash through this very loudly  laura no  travis gently with a push maybe  laura yeah maybe try to push it first  travis fine can i push wait can i try pushing on one of the slabs the right slab  matt sure make a strength check  liam vax is backing the fuck up  taliesin yeah im backing up  travis 24  matt 24 you put both hands and push and push your fingers cracking dig into the stone and it  cracks around the exterior where 
none	 you push about an inch into the stonework with your gauntlets as  you push you watch as the surrounding edges of the stone door this is the right or the left one  travis the right one  matt the right one right you watch as where it meets the stone cracks begin to form at the edge  and with one shift shifting it seems to push forward and falling and impacting you actually  broke whatever mechanism was holding it in place and caused that side of the door to fall inward  booming as it hits 
none	 the ground you hear the echo echoing boom  travis wait i know a saying for this they make them like they used to  marisha thats relevant accurate  travis can i see anything immediately in the  matt make a perception check  liam were all going to die  matt it is pitch black inside there is no light or light source  travis look at that a modifier of zero 18 i have darkvision because of the belt  matt yep not bad all right so you glance inside the lightless chamber first off the smell 
none	  of rot and time i guess you could say that dusty old ancient untouched scent wafts from  the chamber  laura a really old fart  matt yeah as you glance inside you find a single chamber before you that splits off into two  other chambers all rectangular and there are two other subchambers that are beyond you these stand  about 20 feet tall at the height and about 40 feet wide on the one thats on the farthest side  and you cant make it far past to the secondary chamber to the right and 
none	 its asymmetrical one  seems closer than the other theres essentially three chambers that are all attached together  with small entryways that lead to each the floor is covered in flaked shale dirt the occasional  glitter of some sort of errant coin or gold piece or copper piece at this point again you hear the  distant booming of a titan footfall the chamber shakes and a fresh layer of dust falls clouds a  bit before resting to the floor thats the most you can make out at first glance inside this chamber  travis theres more 
none	 tunnels  liam looking for traps dead guys from the door  marisha can i do a peek and check to see if theres signs of any cavein potentials  potential caveins  matt make a perception check  laura can i feel if theres any wind coming from one of the tunnels like theres an opening  somewhere that leads out  travis with your face  laura yeah i want to feel the wind on my face thanks  marisha 28  matt glancing about this chamber its very well made in fact based on the smatterings of 
town	 gold on  the ground and glancing about the way its built this looks to be specifically a vault this once  contained probably a portion of the wealth of the people of this town  liam oh somebody rolled this place  marisha we dont hear anybody or anything  matt not at the moment no  liam 18 investigation check for traps and dead guys  laura 25 for wind  laughter  matt there is a faint bit of airflow through the chamber now that this door is open  laura can i tell where its coming 
none	 from  matt it is coming from the front of you and to the right the chamber you havent been able to  look past entirely to the right you glance about in the entryway now thats open before you there  does not appear to be any trapped mechanism in front of you there are areas where some of the  walls have caved in slightly the ceiling is solid but there are portions where some of the  wall has come in and you can see where rockslides have come to rest on each side and filled in 
none	 some  of the corners there are piles of rags and other wayward bits of materials that have been left  behind and left to rot or sit theres an awful almost citrusy rot smell coming from one of the  far chambers on the left  marisha i drag in the human escort him in and go ahead and light up my hands  matt your hands open up pike has  laura her mace  matt her mace do you come in as well  sam sure yeah  matt all right so you all walk into the 
none	 chamber  laura i think theres an exit ahead and to the right  matt as youre glancing and doing your investigation looking around to confirm that  this was once a vault that held quite a bit of wealth you look at the base of the wall the  parts that you can see that arent buried and you can see scrapes and grooves hundreds of them  like there were once many coins and other heavy metallic materials that were placed in here that  scraped against the stone as they were once on the ground about maybe 
none	 three inches off the ground  you can see this layer of metallic scrapes across the stonework that this place once contained a  fair amount of wealth  liam so if dudes came in here and put stuff in sacks there wouldnt be scrapes  matt you do notice grooves in places and signs that this vault has already been largely raided  of course most everything in here has been taken probably a long time ago based on the center you  do notice that one of the piles of rags begins to twitch and shift ahead of 
none	 you  liam mini jenga  travis mini jenga  liam well theres something under that  laura whispering maybe you should kill it before it says anything to you  liam do you want to i dont think its a small child down here  travis ive become death destroyer of worlds  sam whispering dagger dagger dagger  liam what do you want to do sis  laura i dont know this is all you  sam kill it  taliesin detect undead  liam i dont have much of that left yeah my last one ill use 
none	 it  marisha your last one  liam my last one detect undead divine sense  matt okay divine sense the rag pile its around this portion of rock and fallen debris  behind it theres that pile of rags thats shifting the minute you focus you sense that is  indeed a source of undead energy and at that point the rags rise up and you see a very long  greenish humanoid claw extend as the rag falls back you see a familiar sight youve encountered  trolls in the wild before but these trolls appear to be

none	 across the top of the staff where her  fingers arc around it creates this arc of fire and when she stops she grabs on to a hilt that  didnt exist but now does in her hand that arc of flame that stayed suddenly solidifies into a  scimitarlike blade thats in her hand  laura you can do that  liam shes a fucking jedi  matt all right that ends your turn all right percy  laura you didnt even see it  liam i can imagine it in the abstract universe though i sure can laura

none	 dont rest then i dont get it again six lightning damage plus nine plus two 11  matt both arrows hit it in the chest one two its still standing there the flames curling  around it the ceiling by the way from the impact of the fireball  is looking pretty fragile  laura but thats the exit thats where we need to go to  matt you do see keyleth from this perspective theres a small opening on the far wall where it  looks like possibly whoever raided this vault had previously tunneled into it  laura 
none	 shit would trinket have been able to make it over to him  matt it wouldve been really close probably not you dont know its possible end of your turn  vex pikes up  liam pike saw keyleth go running down that way so she is going to run after her counting she  cant see the troll from there right  matt she can see the troll just past the corner there  liam she can see the troll oh my god i think its time for a guiding bolt  laura singing guiding bolt up the butt 
none	  matt thats our next tshirt guiding bolt up the butt  liam range 120 feet a flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range  make a ranged spell attack against the target on a hit the target takes 4d6 radiant damage and the  next attack roll okay yeah make a spell ranged attack plus ten because its pike yeah youve  got to attack yo heres the white die you gave me 13 plus ten is 23  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis extra damage because its undead 
none	  laura i dont think so 12 guiding bolt  liam specifically toward the taint matt pikes on a tear today  matt all right so as she comes around the corner the holy symbol in one hand clutching  behind the shield she notches the edge of the  mace at the edge of her belt and releases a bolt  of energy how do you want to do this because the radiant damage shuts down the undead fortitude  and the fire knocks down the regeneration  liam the guiding bolt streaks through the air loops down to 
none	 the ground up through the butt up  out the head and out the mouth everyone vaguely hears thats my pike and its head explodes  matt you see the radiant energy bursting out of its eyes and as it screams its head blasted  upward the energy bursting through its mouth the jaw begins to burn away as the flames left over from  the fireball consume the rest of its body it tumbles to its knees and burns into this skeletal  mass that turns to ash on the ground  liam that happened in six seconds it 
none	 was like explosions  laura we need to get out of here its crumbling  travis there are chests about  marisha i take my flaming sword and do a few jedi kid moves when no ones looking go  lightsaber noises  laura i go check for traps on that chest right there  matt make an investigation check  laura 14  matt 14 okay does not appear to be trapped  laura all right then im going to open it  matt you open it there are seven gold pieces two silver and the rest of its 
none	 empty  laura awesome look at all this money  taliesin ill check for traps  matt investigation check  taliesin its a 22  matt 22 okay room does not appear to be trapped from what you can see  taliesin im going to check that trunk the chest  matt youre going to check that for traps as well  taliesin this is not quite as seven  matt make a perception check seven doesnt appear to be trapped  taliesin i open it  matt opens its not locked theres about 12 pieces of gold two copper 
none	 a silver this place  has been cleared out  laura im going to pick up that little pile of gold those couple pieces of gold  i see on the ground  matt you gather what amounts to about 35 gold pieces from there keyleth what did you roll 26  youre watching as one of the supports that the ceilings here are pretty solid the one on the far  end here has sustained damage from the fireball and the drilling entry of whoever came in here  previously and the constant moves of the titan at which 
none	 point you watch and you feel the  rumbling the most recent footfall of the titan the whole ceiling right there in the corner goes  crashing this entire chamber  sam the doors covered  laura can you get through it keyleth  travis remember there were three different ways though and we took one  sam thats the one we need though  liam okay realizing that the druid and the goliath are going to have to figure that out vax  walks to the middle there and starts to take a wee in the corner its been 
none	 a long time  travis do we want to go through the collapsed doorway or do we want to go back to one of the  other tunnels  laura whatever other tunnel options theres probably other monsters trolls fucking undead  waiting there too  sam this is on you grog no dont use any spells dont use any spells grog punch through  this shit  marisha wait i can commune with nature and maybe figure out the tunnel system or depending on  where we are and if we think were on that time crunch and we 
none	 want to get going i didnt want to  burn this yet i did bring find the path which is a oneday concentration spell which gets us to  where we want to go as quick as possible but i dont know can i do that with thar amphala  sam dont you need to know where youre going for that spell to work  marisha well if were getting to thar amphala  sam its a big city  matt its concentration for up to one day but if you lose concentration halfway through  marisha which is why 
none	 i havent wanted to do it yet until we felt like we needed to go  matt to a specific fixed location youre familiar with in the same plane of existence so  you could in theory say thar amphala and it would guide you to the fastest path there until  you lost concentration  marisha im just saying we have that at our disposal when we feel do we want to do a quick  commune with nature then to try and get paths its going to take a few minutes though  sam what would that tell 
none	 you  marisha i could get an idea of the tunnel system for a threemile radius  liam yeah let her do her thing i think we can afford a few minutes then grog could finish  attuning oh you did that stop hitting yourself hammer was attuned  travis oh yeah have i finished attuning with the black hammer of facesmash  sam is the hammer called the stop hitting yourself hammer  matt best you can make out with it it is an adamantine hammer but there is something wrong  about its enchantment there is something about 
none	 it that is locked into your soul at the moment its  occupying a portion of yourself  liam you are going to crit on vecna and ko yourself  matt pike you guys have dealt with cursed items before this is a cursed item  liam greater restoration im looking  travis do i know its cursed its a familiar feeling from craven edge  matt well craven wasnt cursed craven was intelligent this is something has sunk into you  laura shes going to try to greater restoration grog  liam shell grab him by the cheeks and 
none	 squish the cheeks and say grog dont go touching things  you dont know what they are cast greater restoration  matt okay so mark off the greater restoration as you feel the hammer in your hand its like  your fingers wont let go of it theyre almost clenched to it the minute she touches you you  feel this warmth pass through your body through your arms to your hand with that your fingers  widen and the hammer falls to the ground there that hold that it had on you is lifted  travis i think im 
none	 going to leave this here if thats cool with you guys  liam she gives you the mom look and says dont touch it okay  laura do you have time to attune to your other thing  traivs yeah ill pick up the bloodaxe out of the bag of holding and start attuning to that  again old trusty bloodaxe  matt so you guys are taking a short rest to attune in caves and other natural underground  settings make a nature check the radius is only 300 feet when youre underground  marisha okay 25  matt 
none	 25 one this is not a natural underground location the entirety of this area is the inside  of an ancient powerful elemental entity also the spell doesnt function where nature has been  replaced by construction such as dungeons and towns so for the most part that spell would not  aid you my apologies  marisha but youre not letting me cast it right  matt im not letting you cast it that nature check was to see whether or not the surroundings  would help you so you know not to waste that spell so as you 
dung	 take your short rest you attune  to your proper weapon and you begin to talk amongst yourselves as to what the next proper path  or action to take is as you climb through the crypts toward your destination were going to go  ahead and end tonights session there its just past 11  travis ive got to take a picture of this  matt great game guys well done well pick this up in a couple weeks this is an upward dungeon  crawl this is fun  travis he must have fallen against a mountain in
