laura he just tunes it out now  matt i have to  liam except when he doesnt  matt except when i dont which makes it a challenge for you guys which does not help me  anyway last we left off the group of adventurers whose fates are slowly entwining found themselves  meeting in the city of trostenwald on the southern reaches of the dwendalian empire on the continent /town/  of wildemount through a mishap in a circus passing through town you began to give chase to  the investigation that has caught you up in this legal issue and you found yourselves locked under house  arrest and being considered possible murderers you sought the answer to this endeavor you found  the devil toad or the nergaliid as you discovered was responsible you hunted it down  slew it brought its head back and after arguing with a very tired and wanting to get it over with  lawmaster in trostenwald managed to convince her enough to /town/ let you off the hook and leave most of  the standing legal issues with gustav thus disbanding the circus and setting you and yasha  free yasha went on her own path while the rest of you the six of you decided strength in numbers  and at the time being you all seem to enjoy each others company purchasing a fresh  map looking at your future prospects and your dwindling funds you decided to head northward  towards the city of zadash by way of the golden road past the city of alfield and that is where /town/  we left off as you had smacked the rear end of the single horse and cart and sent it spooked  into the northern field  laura we chased after it right  matt you do you chase after it to keep up  laura we dont just lose it  matt being relatively before noon at this point in time youre heading northward along the amber  road the wellpacked dirt of the tenfoot roadway gives you a clear path towards your next  destination the gentle creak of the cart mingles with the clomping of the horse /none/ hooves as you push  forward the midday air is warmer than you expected the skys common gray presence is broken  into smaller cloud patches the victorious blue peeking through you guys continue for a few hours  talking amongst yourselves a bit if there are any questions you wish to ask each other now is  the time  sam any questions  matt meaning if there is anything coming out of the city you wanted to talk about otherwise im  going to continue to push forward with your journey so stop me at any point  /none/ travis is beau is her face all jibbityjacked or is it pretty normallooking at this point  matt make a perception check  travis not that i watched anything from last week because i didnt 16  matt you can see there is some faint bruising starting to show on the left side of the face  travis i bet she doesnt want to talk about that thats a good shiner  marisha thanks  travis did you give as good as you got  marisha i wouldnt say i won because i lost but i did pretty good what /tavern/ color is it right now  is it in that orangeish purple  travis its got the greenyellow sunset happening things are starting to spread tomorrow  will be  marisha right got that little orangey mmhmm  laura its really pretty  marisha thanks  taliesin significant improvement  travis that trouble going to follow you as we go on our way or do you think youre free and clear  marisha oh no that was just a little bar fight nothing just a little friendly sparring nothing crazy  travis nice  laura does anyone want a donut /none/ from my bag  taliesin yes ill have a donut thank you please  liam i would also like a donut please  laura okay here you go i dont have them in real life just this one in real life but in the  game you guys are having delicious donuts  travis how old are those donuts  liam do you actually have donuts i dont understand  laura yeah here you go  liam oh there it is  matt imagination  laura youre doing it peter youre doing it  taliesin i was just going there /none/ damn it bangarang  laura these donuts are not that old  taliesin what does not that old mean does it mean theyre young  liam are they pretty new  laura theyre pretty new yes  liam three days new or forget it i dont actually want to know the answer  laura just eat it its good  taliesin is it good and do we gain or lose hit points  matt no hit point transition no constitution saves theyre a bit stale but still tasty enough  travis any lint from the bag that they were being /town/ held in  matt you can chose to remove it if youd like but it may be part of the texture it adds color  laura thats right its like sprinkles  liam mollymauk is this weird for you to not be traveling with your performing family  taliesin its change but travel is travel so  laura did you travel in a wagon when you were with your family  taliesin oh yes we traveled forever it was constantly on the road once we left home we  stayed moving  matt ironically traveled in the exact wagon that /none/ youre in right now  laura oh nice  liam some things dont change we didnt have much of a chance to see you perform i saw you do  a card reading for jester but things got waylaid at the circus what do you normally do  taliesin oh things im not really much of a performer im more of help set up help run the  shows help make illusions that sort of thing  sam like a techie  taliesin i guess you could say a techie i show off a little bit of the sword juggling /none/  sam oh  taliesin ive got some things i was working on like this  travis you juggling those big motherfucking swords  taliesin yeah  matt you watch as he balances one on the edge of the hand and then tosses it up and catches it as  it falls and takes the other one and glides it across spins it up catches it on his chin on  his nose he makes it hop around its pretty decent  taliesin little roll  laura can you swallow it  matt make an acrobatics check if you want /town/ to try  taliesin well its a curved sword so not the curved ones but i could probably do a straight  sword im not going to swallow a curved sword that would be very complicated to pull off  liam if anybody can do it its you  sam that tiefling anatomy is very strange you know  taliesin im flexible but not that flexible im pretty flexible yeah i never nailed anything  down for a really good act  matt a few hours into travel along the road you catch ahead the sight of another caravan heading /none/  southward in your direction they begin to crest over one of the hills as you look forward too  the central portion of the marrow valley isnt just a smooth constant grade its a series of  rolling hills and high grasses and wheats and grains and a lot of wild weeds that have taken  over the areas between bastions of civilization  liam how far away are they  matt you can see up there about maybe a half mile or so as they crest over one of the hills in the distance  liam yeah i /none/ send frumpkin ahead and see it and go blind and deaf here so i can get a closer look  at them  sam which is frumpkin now  liam frumpkins a sparrow at the moment i dont have the components to put him back to the shape  he prefers which is a cat  laura what are the components  liam charcoal and some incense a kind of incense you have to use im all out i used it all  taliesin not my incense  liam no  travis is there money involved  liam money well /none/ you have to pay money to get the things to do it  travis right im sorry  liam hes been a couple of things before he can last anyway off you go  laura have you ever made him a turtle  matt he cant hear you right now unfortunately  laura have you ever made him a snake have you ever made him a roach  sam hes gone to the other place he wont be able to respond  laura have you ever made him a unicorn  travis oh my god  sam a unicorn would /none/ be really cool  marisha that would be really cool  taliesin id like to see that  laura they exist you know  taliesin i didnt know that  laura they do  matt as your vision crests up with the flight of frumpkin make a perception check for frumpkin  liam dont fuck me scanlan oh thats not scanlan thats percy but you did fuck me percy  taliesin i try  liam that is very low well just say it fails because its a two  matt its a two  liam yeah i rolled a two /town/  matt okay i mean at a safe enough distance to look down there are shapes the most that  frumpkin makes out is that it looks to be six heavy wagons  marisha and laura six  matt six heavy wagons each being pulled by a trio of horses  sam we can rob them  liam 18 horses  travis we should what  sam well we could rob them or we could go off the road and hide and wait for them to pass  laura is frumpkin back do we know all these things yet  /none/ sam oh we dont  matt well say for the purposes of this  sam pleasant day  liam i started muttering as soon as i could see that what they were what i saw  laura do they look like theyre in armor do they look like theyre soldiers  sam he cant hear you  laura do they look like theyre mean  taliesin do they look like theyre unicorns  marisha do they look like theyre traders like traders not traitors  sam he cant hear you  laura do you see are they carrying money are /town/ they carrying people  sam he wont be able to talk to you for a while you see hes not really there  matt coming closer down the road now the gap between your traveling troupe and this caravan  grows smaller and smaller all the rest of you id like to make a perception check please i  think at this point frumpkin has  liam i wouldve released it yeah hes not back but i released the sight  travis 17  liam perception check  sam nine  taliesin 20  marisha 17  laura five  /none/ liam zwölf  matt amongst all of you guys keeping an eye out you look ahead and you can see the wagons are  covered some of them are bundled some of them are taller some of them are smaller what you do  notice is at the front of each of the wagons theres a figure with the reins that is in the  process of sitting there and occasionally making sure the pace is kept relatively steady forward  you do see by the long robes and ornate silk mantles of the highwaymen that are holding these  /town/ reins you get the impression that they probably are from the menagerie coast you two in  particular recognize its not welloff mercantile clothing but it looks like its not rags for a  person that makes this trek up and down the amber road looks like theyre heading southward  probably returning after completing some sort of a trade run up to either zadash or rexxentrum and  spaces nearby as the gap begins to close theres a brief moment of chicken to see whos going to  avert the path as its only about ten foot wide it /none/ would be a pretty tight fit to get both your  troupe and their wagons past do you guys yield or do you continue to push forward  travis i would just like to suggest we might give way there are six of them  taliesin im fine with that  marisha yes agreed  laura yeah  matt you guys skirt your single horse poor thing is pulling this cart on its own  travis were going to kill it  matt its not going any faster really than you guys walking necessarily  laughter  laura but we /none/ get to be lazy  travis but were not walking  laughter  matt because it is not a riding horse it is a beast of burden so its about the same pace that  youre going as you guys pull slightly off into the grass the cart bumps as it hits some rocks  and patches of dirt and thick grass they continue to pass and as they do you see the individuals  the one in the front has what looks to be a thick scarf tossed over the shoulder obscuring part of  the face and she /none/ gives a hand salute up to you as it passes and a bit of a head nod as you wave your  hand frantically a bit of eye contact is made and continues past  laura are you going to nicodranas  matt no response the first cart continues past  laura hi hi are you going to nicodranas  matt the next one looks over to you for a second the head cocked a little bit no we are on our  way to port zoon  laura oh  matt by way of nicodranas  laura oh did /none/ you come from zadash  matt we briefly did yes but we are returning we have finished our wares and we have things to  bring back to sell  laura how far is it to zadash  matt uh at this point hes passed by you and his voice gets a bit louder over his shoulder and  hes like from this point its probably around 150 miles  laura thank you  matt the next one continues one after another you get a better look too the ones at the front  that were pretty heavily covered as /none/ opposed to the ones in the back which are a little taller  and as you look into the back theres little flaps and openings on the inside you can see  theres families traveling  marisha does it look like they have any wares that theyre traveling to trade  matt make a perception check  marisha thats a 16 i think yeah 19  matt glancing through you can see the three wagons towards the back seem to be more for  transport of people it seems like either these merchants are bringing their family with them for /none/  long treks so theyre not apart from them for so long or their family is just a family of traders  or transport looking past them you can see there are a lot of supplies behind them but youre not sure  if theyre wares or just their personal goods  travis molly feel like making some coin doing a little bit of a show  taliesin hmm  matt the fifth carts now passed youre moving on to the sixth cart  taliesin do these people look like theyre in the mood to stop  marisha yeah do /town/ they look sad  matt make an insight check  sam do they look sad  taliesin whats insight  laura plus five  taliesin oh where do you see that oh there it is thank you 19  matt they dont look sad necessarily theyre on the road just kind of looking out and keeping  eyes on the vicinity and probably lost in thought you do see a pair of children hard to gauge their  age at this distance but theyre under the age of ten at least and they seem to look relatively bored  taliesin /none/ ill balance one of the swords on my head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites  laura as you drop them all over the ground  liam wakka wakka  matt you watch as the young boy he has tangled black hair that poofs out a bit on the sides he  has a deeper brown skin and he looks up at you with his bright blue eyes as soon as you begin  balancing the sword he smiles a little bit and jabs his elbow into his sister whos a little bit  older than him /none/ who glances over and points they both point towards you you dont hear anything  they just point and smile as their cart pulls away the sixth cart making distance from you  laura he can tell your fortune  taliesin they didnt poke the parents  laura theyre stupid  matt the caravan continues without you  laura yeah  taliesin ah its very good  laura is it  taliesin yes  laura what does it mean  taliesin it means that youre on a cart  laura it was the chariot  travis would you normally you /none/ know hijack a caravan like that  sam i mean we have in the past if we are confident we can get away with it we would we could  taliesin can you get away with something like that  sam theres a lot of people in that caravan though it seems like a risky maneuver  liam thats a pretty big matzo ball there  taliesin and stealing is wrong but if you did it could you get away with it  sam we could probably get away with it why you want to follow them and rob their /none/ shit  travis just going off what you said earlier i dont want to change your behavior just because  youre with us all of a sudden  sam i mean sure lets go do it  laura hes just trying to get you in trouble  sam oh okay  travis i am not merely asking a question  marisha would you join in in the stand off  travis wait what does that  marisha would you join the stagecoach robbery  travis if were pointing them down reach for the sky  taliesin careful those fingers are /none/ loaded  liam yeah but i would ask are you asking because that is something that you have no  experience with or are you wondering maybe is that something that we could join you in  travis only because i have no experience in it i was just curious what it was that you might have  done you know previously  laura did you hijack a cart  sam no we were more smalltime thieves we wouldnt typically hijack moving caravans usually  wed wait until they parked somewhere and then just go sneak on and steal something /none/ out of the back  liam mostly whatever we can walk away with  marisha the things with moving carts of that big a family is they tend to prep you dont know what  kind of people or weapons they have with them  liam always go for a sure thing  marisha you know how were pretty sure that everyone on this roads going to kill us yeah  everyone else thinks that too  travis fair enough  sam but if you need me to teach you how to steal you can tag along sometime  travis /town/ i might take you up on that yeah  sam all right  taliesin interesting  matt continuing on your path i want to ask which two of you are taking point in keeping an eye on  the road and the landscape around you as you progress  travis fake cough beau  marisha yeah ill take watch  travis oh sorry  matt okay beau and who else  travis so generous of you  laura you want to do it  taliesin i was going to say yeah ill take a round im used to keeping an /town/ eye out on the road  matt so the two of you are taking point up until you guys decide to change it when it comes to  travel along the road  marisha its just general perception  matt yes i would like you both currently about an hours journey past that intersection with the  other caravan to make a perception check  laura ooh i bet someones going to try to hijack our shit on the road just like we were talking  about then  marisha not too bad 18  travis yeah smash  matt /none/ 18 and eight actually both of you dont really notice anything  marisha oh take that back take it back  matt both of you keeping an eye out the hills continue to roll you see patches of trees and  small wooded areas grass field is tall but its beautiful and the light breeze that blows through  you can see the waves of wind as they come across you can hear the faint sound of it moving the  fields across  marisha is there a tree that looks climbable that i could get a vantage point  /town/ matt there is its maybe about 600 feet off the road but you can try and head over there if you  want to  travis plus weve been traveling for what about hour and a half two hours now  matt id say total right now youve been probably on the road for about four hours  marisha oh  travis we should probably rest the horse for just a bit  laughter  marisha sure anyone want to take a quick pee break  laura yes  sam yes please  marisha all right lets go over to /town/ the bushes  matt all right so you guys leave the cart on the road or do you take it off to the side  sam should leave a guard with the  laura we should lead it off the road  marisha can we take it with us fairly easily  matt i mean you can the progress will slow a bit because youre now taking it through the hills  and the field and having to push the cart through the grass  liam no we should take it off the road  laura just off the road /town/ a little bit  marisha just off the road but we dont have to go all the way to the tree i can  taliesin ill sit with the cart for the first roll  travis ill stay with you  liam where are you going to do  marisha im just going to go check out this tree over here see if i can get a little better  vantage  liam okay i have a bird that can go probably higher than the tree if you want  marisha yeah kind of forgot about that  liam would /none/ you like me to do that  laura maybe she likes climbing trees  liam or you could i dont want to rob you of the joy of climbing a good tree  travis or falling out of it which we would really enjoy  taliesin that would be actually extremely  marisha both are very pleasant but i do not necessarily need that to feel fulfilled  liam okay well i will sit in the field then and give him a little chuck under the chin and oh  wait before i go away am i looking for anything /town/ specific  marisha just people coming  liam people coming  matt as the rest of you take a moment to step off to the side of the road pull out some of your  travel supplies to feed the horse give it a rest  laura pick some flowers  matt pick some flowers which you can find theyre wildflowers theyre bright white  scattered and simple but theyre beautiful in their own right you all take a bit to relieve yourselves a  little ways off the road you make your way towards the nearest tree and its /none/ a cluster of  about five or six that are nearby this pocket where it seems like some seeds long ago got  dropped by a bird probably over the sky and then proceeded to grow and sprout the lowest  branch is about ten feet up so youre going to have to take a quick leap and try and climb some  of it  marisha i wanted to wait for caleb  matt oh thats right youre waiting there never mind you see that tree and you go ill  get to that later  marisha its a /none/ damn good tree i do miss climbing trees  laura do you need me to lift you up to the branch  matt your eyes cloud over  liam they do as the bird is flying just for a second i say you know ordinarily i cant hear  you but hes a cat almost all the time so this is a rarity youll be able to climb many trees  many other times but we should take advantage of him well okay  laura none of us were nearby when he was saying all of that  matt no /none/ you guys were quite a ways off no one was in earshot  travis we were shitting in the bushes  matt a ladybug lands on his nose and goes in his nostril but he cant feel it  liam feel it i can feel stuff  matt maybe not this youre too focused  liam we worked out that he could okay great theres bugs in my nose  matt it tickles a little bit  liam shove it all in everybody  matt to be fair your face itches in general from the sheer amount of filth thats /none/ on it its hard  to really differentiate  liam in the middle of the field you hear ooh look at that what do i see  matt make a perception check for your birdie  liam thats a nine  matt glancing over and doing a wide pass around as everyone begins to gather their things and head  towards the cart the roads pretty open at this point the previous caravan is invisible from that  height the hills close that distance you dont see anything coming your way it seems pretty open  and safe  liam /none/ okay i keep flying for a little bit longer  matt okay  laura i lift beau up to the branch just because  marisha okay feels like childhood do you want up here  laura yeah ill jump  marisha all right i lift her up  laura we sit up in the branches  matt okay cool its a nice view  laughter  travis its impossible to believe him  marisha is there anything carved in the branches in the tree trunk  matt make an investigation check  liam the treant eats you  matt shh /none/ dont spoil it  marisha 18  matt no carvings of names or letters but you do see a few knots in the tree that have currently  been carved out and made a home to a number of woodland creatures  laura ive never climbed a tree before  marisha really  laura yeah this is really pretty  marisha what do you think lives in that hole  laura probably very small unicorns  marisha have you ever seen an unicorn  laura yes ive seen many the little ones can be as small as hamsters  marisha /town/ pocket unicorns  laura yeah  marisha where do you find such things  laura all over you just have to know where to look  sam and believe  taliesin shes starting to believe  marisha what is it like being in your head  laura its pretty great  matt eventually you all gather yourselves again back at the wagon cart it back onto the road and  head northward another few hours pass before the sun begins to set as the sky grows darker the  clouds from the northnortheast begin to filter in with a colder /none/ wind you get the sense that the  warm day that you had is coming to a close and who knows how long the current cold weather will keep  the light begins to fade darker and darker until you get the sense that you have about 30 minutes  before this field goes pitch black  liam how cold is it out  matt you can see your breath  laura oh thats pretty cold  matt not super thick but when you exhale you see a bit of the breath before you  travis should we pull off /town/ on the side of the road and get a campfire going  taliesin id say lets get a bit off the road if possible  marisha does it look like theres any trees or any base of mountains or any place that would be a  good sheltered campsite  matt there are no mountains anywhere in the vicinity youre in the center of the rolling  hills there is a cluster of trees you could go to thats about 300 feet or so off the road its  three trees so its not a lot of cover but unfortunately /dung/ youre in the middle of a valley  taliesin itll do  laura can we get the horse over to them  matt it takes you a little bit you spend about 45 minutes in pitch dark keeping an eye in that  direction before you come upon the tree you can faintly see the outline of the tree against the  faint bit of light making it through the cloud cover you guys stop there get the horse a little bit of  water and feed and the sites yours  taliesin set a tent start a fire  /none/ laura this is why we shouldve taken one of the circus tents  taliesin they take an awful lot of time to put up you do know this theres a process  laura yeah but think about how cool it would be to camp in one  taliesin oh it would be amazing ive done it its great but this is nice too  travis shall we collect some wood and start a fire  sam sounds good  matt whos starting the fire  travis anybody want to come with me to find some kindling  marisha i have /dung/ an adventurers kit does that have a tinder in it  matt you can do that  travis shall we  marisha sure  travis all right go look for some deadish branches  marisha im a little you be my eyes its super dark  sam maybe you shouldnt go  marisha you know what ill start digging a little pit  liam now hold on i pull a rag out and i poof one of the dancing lights and make that hooded  lantern again so that you can see  matt with that light its easy enough /none/ to find some small kindling theres not a whole lot in  the vicinity mainly being that its an open field but you find a few pieces of fallen tree  and general dead plant life in the vicinity that can get something going  taliesin we can chop it up  matt eventually you get a fire going its a little beacon of light here in the darkness  orangeish flickering against the interior of the three trees as you guys are situated there  you figure youve made it a little under halfway to alfield which is the /none/ small city on the way to  zadash itll take you a little over a days travel or if you push it

thats a 19  matt okay keeping an eye out you see a little ways off its hard to make out any shapes  because of your human eyes and with the firelight thats near you your eyes cant adjust to the  darkness as well but there are bits and pieces where the clouds do break the moonlight comes  down and you can see a distant shape thats moving through the /dung/ field maybe about 400 feet off you  can see it pushing through the height of the grass moving slowly  liam am i the only one awake at this moment  matt yep  liam i slowly jiggle nott awake whispers get up  sam it was violin class what  liam i put a hand over her mouth  sam whats going on  liam there is a thing out around our fire a ways off  sam why did we leave you on watch you cant see in the dark  liam no i saw the shape /dung/

sam 26  marisha what do i see  matt you vaguely see the shape moving but its hard to see and only because of the moonlight /none/  nott as you stealth up and quickly move through the grass eventually you hear this soft grunting  you glance up and see there is not one but three large buffalotype creatures that are  lumbering through the fields  sam buffalotype creatures or buffalo  matt youre not sure youre not close enough to see you see theyre bipedal theyre thick and  muscular and they have these large horns that curl off to the side and out  travis bipedal  matt sorry quadruped not bipedal

way back im going to see if theyre eating  or sleeping what are they doing  matt theyre just moving as you head back to the camp you can see they pass and continue heading  in the southwestern direction in the field not taking notice of your fire or the encampment  sam they could be good for meat we could go kill them and eat them for meat  liam is she back  matt yes  liam i scoop her up look at you you cast a spell /none/ you spoke to me  sam you said to do the hand movements and the whispery thing and i did it and it worked  liam its as simple as that isnt it  sam yes  liam oh im so

/none/ to make a stealth  check please  sam 12  travis and marisha 11  liam 16  matt all right the four of you shoulder to shoulder keeping low making your way through the  field stepping ever so carefully and theres this croaking as one of you accidentally goes  completely foot down on to some sort of field frog that had been there as the croak hits you watch  as one of the creatures startled grunting and they all start running away spooked by the sound  travis shit  marisha can we tell what /none/ they are now that were closer  matt make a perception check if you want to  travis id like to with my darkvision  matt at disadvantage on you unfortunately at this distance  taliesin welcome to human  marisha six  matt they look like buffalolike creatures  travis 13  matt they look like buffalo  sam youll never know what they were  travis well that was worth a look  matt you arent too familiar with a lot of the indigenous animals that live or have been brought  to this region if they havent /none/ been near the port towns that you grew up in you havent seen these  types of creatures before but you vaguely know theyre in the ballpark of what a buffalo you  imagine looks like  travis its vaguely what i imagine a buffalo would look like  marisha yeah  sam sorry  marisha that was fun lets go  travis back to sleep  liam silently ruffle notts hair on the way back to camp  sam stop it  laura singing whos got the third watch  taliesin ill take it  liam turd watch  /none/ matt all right molly has the third watch  taliesin turd watch  matt perception check please  laura oh no  taliesin six  matt okay as you keep an eye out everyone else sleeps throughout the evening eventually you nod  off and fall asleep with the rest of them i would like to ask all of you to leave the table  for a moment except for fjord  travis for me  matt yeah  marisha its your turn now  travis why shouting why didnt you roll a higher perception  taliesin i literally dont /dung/ know thats actually the problem  marisha just dont get a lich phylactery installed in you again  taliesin travis its been nice playing with you  travis oh god oh no  taliesin i thoroughly enjoyed your accent  travis oh shit  matt fjord as darkness takes your mind dreamless like most you await the emptiness of  sleep to carry you to the day your sense of body fades but your mind and the dark linger minutes  hours days time loses real sense and meaning but youre conscious for it and that is almost  maddening /none/ in that split second or endless stretch of experience that youre currently unable to  express as the time passes the air grows colder around you the faint shimmer of shifting midnight  blue muted and distant now showing endless depth before you rippling you begin to flail about  your senses returning with the dropping temperature but there is resistance to your limbs  as you push in the space around you youre sluggish theres force its not air its water  you suddenly feel the burning pain in your lungs as your breath fights to escape you but /none/ you hold  tight you seize and swim in desperation choosing any direction but the shimmering blue is  directionless there is no up there is no down its just depth movement the universal shadows  dance as one right to left with a speed that pulls you along with the current you feel  yourself being jostled as it shifts again to the left to right around behind you you find  yourself toppling head over end eventually coming to rest again you spiral over and over  again the darkness swallowing you tightening around you as this dance /none/ this shape this endless  coil this spiral around you as the current tugs at you battering you you cannot fight any more  as the increased power of the current pulls on your form you cough and the freezing waters rush  into your body the briny taste of salt water stinging your insides your wincing eyes open with  the pain that clutches the interior of your chest only to see a gargantuan mass moving through the  water around you like a massive noose closing in the pain in your chest vanishes as your breathing  normalizes /none/ thicker than air but breathable all the same it feels strange yet weirdly familiar  in that moment yellow light bursts before you in the shape of an enormous yellow eye an  impossibly low tone rumbles through the waters around you shaking you to your core like an  organic war horn the size of a canyon the eye narrows as the tone grows stronger a thought  enters your mind a jumble of emotions that your brain attempts to make sense of until a word  congeals into the center of your consciousness watching the eye just looks /none/ at you waiting expectantly  travis english accent what are you  matt watching  travis watching me  matt the eye opens a bit and leans closer towards you potential  travis my potential what are you asking of me  matt learn  travis learn what would you have me learn  matt learn grow provoke consume  travis learn grow provoke consume i dont understand  matt reward  travis a reward for this im listening  matt patience the eye closes and the light is gone you feel the darkness and the cold  completely suffuse /none/ your entire world as the panic and solitude the true quiet of your  unconsciousness begins to take hold at that moment you gasp for breath and your eyes open  coughing and sputtering in the morning air if we could have everybody else come back to the table  please call them back in  travis fuck fuck you what were those words  matt watching potential learn grow provoke consume well go over the rest later come on in  sam are we supposed to come back  matt yes youre supposed to come back in  laura /none/ were supposed to come in  matt you are  travis sorry i found a patch of strawberries  taliesin everybody back  matt everybody back  liam are you okay were fine everythings good  travis yeah were fine were great just doing dandy yep  liam you would tell us if something was wrong  travis of course  sam that was fast you really fought five guys in an alleyway that fast  travis sometimes it doesnt take that long you know what i mean  laura what does he look like what are we doing  /none/ matt as the rest of you have already come to consciousness in the morning air begun to situate  your belongings and put out the embers of the fire that lasted pardon throughout the night your  morning belches getting out fjord has slept in and has been ever so still in his sleep suddenly  without warning he suddenly shoots up from his sleep his eyes wide and as he opens his mouth  begins coughing and spitting water up  travis coughing  sam oh no hes injured  laura fjord have i ever seen this happen to /none/ him before  matt no  liam can you speak  travis yeah no im fine  taliesin yeah you look it  liam you just spit a lot of water out and you were sleeping  taliesin was it a lot of water  matt it was a sizeable glass filled with water  taliesin im going to do something very weird im going to walk over and dampen my hand on the  water on his chest really quickly and sniffing  matt its briny and salty  taliesin huh  sam why are you drinking salt water /none/  taliesin you dont know that  sam oh in sams voice why are you drinking  salt water  laughter  laura jeez fjord thats a lot of drool  marisha does it taste like stomach acid because thats gross man  taliesin only one way to find out  travis like a momma bird everybody have some of what i puked up its all good  liam i dont i want to make an insight check  hes talking about acid reflux but he just spit a  bunch of water out  matt yeah make an insight /none/ check  liam yeah okay thats 22  travis yeah i dont think it was acid reflux  marisha you taste like a seaman  laughter  travis i dont know i want to shake your hand but at the same time i want to smash it  matt ive never been more proud of my wife  taiesin thats not normal  laura what happened fjord  liam does he seem full of shit to me  matt seems like hes covering some confusion or at least trying to deflect  travis i had a dream im sorry a /none/ vivid one just shook me to my core a little ill be fine  really its not a common thing  laura why the water though  travis i dont know  marisha you never told me where you got that sword i mean because i saw it get a little soggy  a little drippy when we were fighting the frog thing so you know  matt as you glance down at your sheath on the ground it is empty there is no falchion  travis yeah that sword is a pickle  marisha its a pickled sword are /none/ there benefits to pickling your weapons  travis its a mystery  marisha oh right  taliesin hes not wrong though it actually is a pickle you can taste it  marisha yeah it is very salty  laura i do like pickles  taliesin yeah its not bad  liam is our group going to be all about puns and that stuff  sam its the lowest form of humor  laura is it really the lowest  taliesin level three  marisha okay there are some pun competitions that get serious  sam are you all right fjord /none/  travis yeah i feel funny caleb you remember me asking you about your arcane prowess  liam yeah  travis my small experience with the arcane came to me around the same time that sword did  liam how long ago was that  travis not too long ago very recent right before i met up with jester  sam were you in the ocean  travis yeah i was did a lot of merchant sailing previously had one trip that didnt go  so well suffice it to say after it was done i found that sword  /none/ marisha what happened on the trip rough waters  travis yeah  sam did anyone die  travis yeah im not real comfortable talking about it  liam what about the sword you said you found it on the ocean you found on the boat you were on  you were on an island what do you mean  travis i found it on the shore when i got back to land it was just there im not super familiar  with a ton of weaponry the sword i know i had some training in it but this seemed like /tavern/ a unique  sword i felt like it almost called to me i know how that sounds but when i picked it up seemed  like everything changed ever since ive been able to do more things been able to reach out  with some of the stuff ive seen you do thats why im trying to make it up to the academy im  trying to figure out what it is that i have  liam dm when i cast detect magic in the first game in the tavern did that sword light up  matt no  travis /none/ i dont mean to alarm any of you really im trying to be as forthright as i can  taliesin where is the sword right now  travis can i make it appear  matt you look down and its not in the sheath you glance around its nowhere near you  travis i focus reach down  matt he looks down at his open palm and there is a flash of greenishblue teal energy out of his  grip there clutched within his grasp you see the falchion coated in the remnants of sea floor  life you see /none/ the barnacles encrusted around the edge and up the back of the blade as it begins to  drip water the same kind that was coughed up by fjord this morning  travis you can see why im a little curious about this item  taliesin thats a great trick  liam i dont even need to touch it but would you trust me to study it for a moment  travis do you have any experience with items like this  liam im good at figuring things out im clever  marisha i might be able help you with /none/ that i was obsessed with underwater life and mermaids so  ive read a few books  travis could we revisit that idea perhaps im sorry the night has left me a bit shaken and i  feel like i need a moment to get my bearings if thats all right  liam ja you can understand that we would be curious but i dont want to push anybody i mean  weve just met  travis of course not and i dont want to make anyone feel uneasy again trying to be as transparent as  i can i /none/ dont quite understand and i appreciate your patience in advance and i make it vanish  matt you watch as it just disappears out of your grip  liam when he says he doesnt quite understand is he telling the truth is that the same insight check  matt you have to make a new one  liam 11  taliesin 23  matt 23  taliesin this whole story ive been watching  matt as far as you can tell as forthright and honest as youve heard him be  taliesin thats so disappointing all right  laura fjord /none/ do you think youre slowly turning into water  travis sighs no i hadnt considered that terrifying thought but thanks ill just add that  to the fucking list  laura if you feel like its happening let us know and well try to catch you in a jar  travis in a jar  taliesin unless he runs away  sam were not going to let you run into the dirt  laura maybe something can happen  travis tell you what i start sweating real hard ill let you know okay  taliesin hes fine  marisha has /dung/ that happened to you before by the way the whole waking up coughing salt water thing  travis i dont really remember  liam you wouldnt have to remember that far back you said that this all started just a few weeks  ago when you met this one  travis i dont really remember my dreams all that well they leave me quickly  taliesin i remember all of mine i dont know  laura ive never seen him wake up with water all over him  marisha well excited to see what unfolds shall we  taliesin if /town/ youre going to vomit something salt waters pretty decent it could have been way worse  laura of all things its way better than vomit  taliesin oh its far superior already youre proving to be an asset  laura if we get really thirsty well just come to you in the morning  taliesin you cant drink the salt water makes you thirstier  laura oh really  taliesin it feels like you should be able to but you cant  sam should we get back on the road then  travis if you wouldnt mind  sam how /none/ is horse doing today  travis horse  sam hows horse  laura what is his name  liam i was wondering the very same thing actually all night i was wondering what we would call  laura this horse maybe he has a name molly  taliesin does the horse have a name if it did ill make one up  matt it probably had a few names in travel and youve gone through a few horses  taliesin try not to name them were just going to end up eating them  matt so whatever you come up /none/ with  taliesin his name was winters crest if he lived that long that was when we were going to butcher  him and eat him you can rename him its fine  laura i like it its like a celebration  taliesin that was the plan  sam maybe for short well call him wc  liam you were going to butcher at winters crest and thats a special treat  taliesin it means youre going to eat meat and then youre going to make some jerky and then  youre going to buy another horse with the money /none/ you make  matt interesting point too for most of you winters crest would have little meaning its  largely celebrated in continents to the west as it is specific to a historic event that did not  happen in wildemount but youre a carnival so you guys have more of a vast and strange knowledge  taliesin we celebrate everything  matt when he says winters crest maybe beau  liam have i ever read about it  laura i feel like my mom saw lots of visitors from other places  matt its possible but just for a /town/ bit of information  marisha i feel like the snooty town that i came from would have a winters crest festival like  how we have oktoberfests out here even though we have no real business having them yeah  taliesin just glögg lots and lots of glögg  matt as you guys look off at this conversation with the horse the horse is currently about 30  feet off in the field eating grass out of the field  taliesin if youre on the road long enough you eat a lot of animals you eat a lot of beasts /none/ of burden  laura i wander over to the wagon and i go and sit down and start drawing because i need to i need  to spend a little time  liam i pull nott over do you know what wc means in zemnian  sam what does it mean  liam toilet  sam its a pun  laughter  liam i give her a little fistbump  matt as you guys gather up in the fresh morning air back into the cart  marisha do some pullups on the tree branches  matt as beau gets nice /town/ and swole for the morning  liam vasquez  marisha just a little bit  travis youre just too bad vasquez  matt laughter vasquez is a pretty good print i think we were talking vasquez and starbuck  from the new battlestar are both good character prints for beau yeah love that as you guys  bring the cart back up onto the amber road northward you begin your secondday trek you  guys push on for a few hours is it still beau and mollymauk keeping point  taliesin ill keep  marisha i dont mind  matt /dung/ ill have both of you roll a perception check please  marisha do we have the highest perception  taliesin ugh i did until it bounced  marisha fuck i almost got samesies 11  taliesin five  matt okay  laura i have decent perception whats yours  matt calm fields  taliesin i might be distracted looking for things that i can pluck out of the fields all right  matt you push on for a few more hours the afternoon staring to get late you can choose  soon when it gets dark to set up camp /dung/ again and stay another evening out in the fields or you get  a sense looking at the map that you had procured that if you push an extra hour or so past you  could probably make it to alfield before the nights done  sam lets do that  taliesin most of us can see in the dark its not a big deal  travis yeah  laura okay you guys just hunker down in the wagon okay you be safe  marisha deal  liam must be nice  travis liam and taliesin singing must be nice /none/  taliesin cant say that ah  matt all righty you guys push forward kind of pick up the pace a bit but the horse and those of  you who are on the sides of the cart if you wish to you can jog along the side to alleviate some  of the burden  marisha im going to scan still while im  matt keeping an eye out  marisha with my shitty vision  matt okay the sun does eventually close towards the cyrios mountains to the west and night begins  to fall at this point /none/ you do see just over the distance in the hill as darkness comes you can  see the faint glow a cluster of light of a village in the distant hills you get the sense  that this is probably alfield at the perimeter of your vision as you continue to push forward  youve now gone past eight hours of continuous travel into the ninth hour i would like you all  to roll a constitution saving throw please  marisha and taliesin natural 20  laura whoa thats because you guys are oh no youre riding in the /none/ cart  marisha im riding  travis 16  marisha im just like whats wrong  liam sam and laura nine  matt nine as well wow its like rammstein on that side of the table  laughter  travis nein cookie monster  matt all right so the three of you take one level of exhaustion  laura aw how do we do that in here  liam how does that affect us again  matt this is a good thing to look up essentially per point of exhaustion  taliesin so you go to your hp  matt /none/ there you go so you have disadvantage on ability checks until you take a long rest to get  rid of it  laura disadvantage on abilities  matt yes on ability checks so skills and things like that  laura okay okay okay  matt all right you guys are youre a few youre probably about a half mile away from  alfield and it looks even at this distance a bit smaller than trostenwald where you were you can  see the faint clusters of trees on the north eastern and northeastern sides of the city  otherwise /town/ its just in this pocket behind a few hills its a bit podunk in size you can gather  from this distance but its welcoming theres a flash of orange light on the outskirts of town  liam did that look arcane to me  matt no it just looked like a flash i mean it could have been arcane its hard to tell at this  distance its quite a ways away  taliesin thats weird  matt theres a second one flash you faintly see what looks like the distant curl of flames  beginning to spread across /none/ what appears to be a roof  travis oh shit  laura oh no  marisha think we just watched someone commit arson you guys  travis thats not really a  marisha lets go kick their ass  travis yeah lets do that  laura does it look like the fire is spreading at all  matt i mean as you sit here and watch  laura were walking  taliesin lets head that direction and start yelling at people  travis and taliesin full sprint  travis fire  matt you guys begin to go into a faster /town/ jog in that direction as you do you can see the fire is  now beginning to consume a handful of buildings and the flames are beginning to flicker higher  you begin to hear in the distance a very faint highpitched yelp or some sort of a screech its  hard to make it out at this distance its an open field area and its mingling with what sounds like  now dozens of voices screaming and entwining as you can see the uncontrolled flames still  progressing on the eastern side of the village you can just see /town/ as you get within a few hundred  feet of the western side of alfield people just running villagers probably a few hundred of  them are now just running out of the town as you guys begin to approach towards you and out into  the field so as youre approaching theyre coming your direction  taliesin im going to stop one and ask what happened  matt as you glance over you see a family of five halflings rushing right past you the mother is  dragging two of the younger ones by the hand while the father /town/ is running alongside the eldest  daughter probably in her teens the father wears a leather cap and has a handlebar mustache and  simple farm clothing as you shout out he makes your eye contact  taliesin what has happened  matt oh i dont know what happened they started to burn the buildings and these things  started rushing the city is under attack  laura what things  matt panicked big things dogfaced i cant come on they just keep running  laura dogs are attacking the village  matt at this point you guys can see /none/ more people are fleeing as you get closer about 100 feet  outside the city you watch as the droves of people are beginning to get at least either the  ones that are actively fleeing have made it out of the city or in the process the stragglers are still  coming through you see a young human man with scrappy tattered brown hair a bit of blood  dripping down his face running before his back arches and he falls into the grass you can see an  arrow protruding from his back at that point you can /none/ see standing up from behind one of the  exterior walls of the city a humanoid creature stretching up to about seven feet tall muscular  torso with thin doglike legs you watch as it extends its neck with spots of fur its ears  curled upwards as it has a doglike snout at the front of it  laura werewolves  matt you watch as it leaps onto the back of this fallen villager bites into the shoulder and tears  a chunk out swallows it before it growls into the air yipping howl  laura is that a /none/ werehyena  sam have we seen these things before  matt you have youve encountered a roving band of these on your way southward  laura what is it  sam i think theyre well we dont know what theyre called we just fought them i dont know  what theyre called we fought one before  laura you know how to kill them  sam you just hurt them until they die  matt it swallows the flesh grabs the body and then darts back into the city dragging the corpse  of the villager its just killed with /none/ it rapidly  taliesin thats weird  liam is it a walledin city or just parts here and there  matt no theyre small and waist high and shoulder high walls that are partitions here and  there but its largely a farming city  liam not fortified at all  matt no not at all  laura is he within range to hit with a spell  matt no hes about well depends on the spell right now hes about 200 feet from you and hes  running into the city you can see the flames are further in /none/ but you can see the orange glow  flickering in the distance  marisha can i do a quick scan and see if i see more  matt perception check  marisha dont fuck this up thats okay 17  matt 17 in the immediate vicinity you do not you see more people from the village starting to  run out screaming you see a handful of crownsguard come out one of them looks wounded  and is to the north where are they coming from you see the two of them dart off northward  into the city what /none/ are you guys doing  travis i chase after the crownsguard  matt okay  laura go after the one that stole the guy  marisha well go after the one that stole the guy  taliesin is this making my spider sense tingle can i track them  matt no  taliesin okay  matt you get the sense at the moment theres no active idea that these would be considered a  creature that would draw your attention  taliesin okay all right  matt are you leaving the cart there on the outskirts  travis yes  /town/ liam we leave the toilet behind and we run in  matt all right as you go charging into the city youre pushing past fleeing villagers and you can  see some of the buildings now have been locked shut you can see faintly through the windows  furniture being boarded up from the inside people are hunkering down for whatever this assault is  as you enter you see the crownsguard went northward but the one creature that you saw charge  in went straight towards the heart right now you can see theres two main streets that bisect /none/ this  small village theres one that goes at an angle northwest to southeast one that goes right  towards the center west to east as you head towards the center you can see the flames are more  near that central square as you guys begin to run push past a few more people the smoke is  starting to billow up and you can see now theres embers rising and then falling this very faint  ashy rain of small points of reddishorange light that begin to fall with the ash as you turn  around one of /town/ the buildings theres one of the side walls and four crownsguard all ducked down  behind the wall with crossbows and longbows all back behind it you can see one thats adorned  with more ornate armor you see a person there with elven features but hint at a mixed  lineage they have their helmet on the ground showing shoulderlength blond hair thats turned  red in places from a spattering of gore through gritted teeth they curse in pain as the bandages  are applied to what you can see is a wound right around the midsection in /none/ the thigh area another  soldier is in the process of wrapping it you watch as they go gah you fool bind the wound  dont stuff it goes and they pull a bolt back into the crossbow and nock it at the ready  glancing up and seeing you approach they scan past you most of you now with weapons at the  ready it seems charging forward you you suddenly have an array of arrows about five or  six come over the wall one of them manages to pierce the back of one of the crownsguards heads /none/  and falls and crumples to the ground they all get lower again you hear in the distance growling yips  the individual looks back to you you are you ablebodied  laura yeah  sam very  matt and youre armed  travis we are  matt 30 gold a gnoll ear now get in there and help  travis a

marisha nott and jester do you guys have ways to block arrows  matt whoosh two of them glace up and fire two crossbow bolts over the wall and duck back behind  you hear a heavy smashing of wood some more barks and gibbering echoing around the way you can see  now flames curling up to the top of the building that youre all right next to before the small  wall that bisects the entryway  laura i have a shield  taliesin i start one of my swords on /none/ the back of my neck  liam  we are sitting ducks here what do we do fjord  travis its all on the other side of a wall  matt correct  marisha lets go towards the wall  matt to give you perspective now  sam oh thisll help hey side note wheres my fucking wine  laura did you leave it  travis you mean your water  marisha did you leave it outside  sam is it gone  marisha no its just on the table  laura whoa oh my gosh where are we  /none/ matt you guys  laura this is so cool look at that flame on the side of the roof  matt you are all right over this side area corner arrange yourself as you feel you wish to  be over there on the far end of the village  sam oh wow what a cool map  matt if you wish to you can place yourselves where you wish or show me where you want them to go  liam i would be pressed against the wall of that house  matt right here  laura before i ran /none/ over here im going to caleb ill hit you on the shoulder and say bless you  and im going to give you blessing of the trickster just in case you want to stealth because  youre squishy yo  liam okay so i have advantage on stealth  laura yes  liam thank you  marisha ill be with jester  sam the enemies are just all over that direction right  matt with what little bit youve looked over to the side you can see there are some up on the  rooftops in the distance you can /dung/ see their dark figures silhouetted by flames and other bits of  light that normally fill the streets in the center of the city most you can see are these up here and  you can already see a few bodies of guards and civilians that are lying on the ground carved  open and not moving you see spatters of blood you still hear them barking and giving orders next  to each other rabid barking  laura how far away are the ones on the roof how long is the distance from us  matt over here at /none/ this distance its hard to say id say probably in the neighborhood of about  70 to 80 feet from you you guys i would like if you are trying to stay out of sight make a  stealth check please those of you with a point of exhaustion you have disadvantage  marisha natural 19  laura six  taliesin 21  sam 15  liam 16  marisha 25  travis 14  sam so revealing  laura yeah well im exhausted  matt thats okay as a group for the moment you guys havent drawn their attention /town/ youre still  right next to where there are crownsguard who are in the process of a firefight with whatever is in  this vicinity of the city however you may or may not make it through for the moment unseen youre  not certain how many there are but you can hear a lot of yipping and growling right around this  large twostory building that is currently engulfed in flames  sam i have an idea we need to move away from here right fjord  travis we do we have to use the cover of the buildings /none/  sam all right i think i can do something that would make them fire many of their arrows at  something but not us should i do that and then as soon as they fire their arrows we can run  travis diversions are absolutely  sam diversions thats what its called its a diversion all right may i move is that a thing  matt you may youre stealthed currently  sam i take out a bit of fleece and repeating the words and doing the hand gestures that ive been  taught and tracing the image of /none/ a creature on the fleece i will make a silent image of the guard  who told us 30 gold a gnoll im going to have the image of that guard dash across slowly dash  across this alleyway like that way  liam maybe amble more than dash  sam yes not dash just walk in a way that he could be easily shot  matt interesting point of order youre not too certain of the gender of this individual kind of fluid  sam okay great that longhaired guard individual  matt there you go as the figure /none/ leaps over the wall and begins making a run towards the center  area about four different arrows pass through its form before one of these gnoll creatures goes  lumbering forward and slashes out to it this gnoll interestingly enough the other ones you  see and the one you saw before the city are all built and muscular this one seems to be porous  with a brief bit of view you can see theres clumps of fur and exposed bone and part of its  skull is just pushing out of its snout with teeth gnashing as /none/ it tears into the illusion it claws  through confused and looks over in your direction as youre finishing drawing your blade across your  back what normally would be cold energy suddenly flickers into this beacon of bright white light  sam ooh nice  matt something clicks in your mind and youre like oh i know you  taliesin im preparing how close am i to this thing  matt this entity would be here now it would have just left out into that section there  taliesin does it see us  matt it does now  /none/ taliesin im going to use vicious mockery at it really quickly  matt all right  laura can i invoke duplicity  matt you may im giving you all one round preparation before we roll initiative  travis yeah i was going to say were in it this is a fight so anything you want to do now  do it  liam i mutter a few words and my form starts to blink in and out of view there is another caleb  next to me and another caleb next to me shifting blinking flashing back and forth and /none/ its hard to  see where i am  matt okay is that concentration  liam yeah it is  matt all right im going to put a concentration marker on you just so we remember it  travis can i also knowing that were probably going to be up close danger close im going to  cast armor of agathys on myself you see a spectral frost start to harden around my armor in  a shimmering light  matt thats cool so thats you thats you youre going to vicious mockery  taliesin im going to use vicious /none/ mockery im going to look at him with my eyes glowing and my  sword glowing and in infernal say rasping the light comes to blind your eyes and burn your  flesh yeah 1d4  matt he rolled a 13 minus three i believe its wisdom correct  taliesin yeah its a wisdom saving throw  matt im pretty sure thats a ten and that does not make your dc  taliesin yup so he takes three psychic damage and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll  matt yes  taliesin im going to use my bonus /none/ action yeah fuck it lets go for it im going to activate  both swords  matt you drag the other edge of your blade  taliesin should i yeah  matt youve taken a total of six damage and your max hp is down by six but you have currently the  new invoked rite on each blade  laura can i use my bonus action really fast  matt you may  laura to say a little pray to the traveler and im going to cast spiritual weapon  matt you may do that where are you going /none/ to cast it  laura im going to cast it right above this zombie gnoll its going to be in the shape of a  giant lollipop like a bludgeoning lollipop  matt you watch as this flash of purplish energy suddenly apparates into the air this thicklike  wooden handle that is jammed into a massive bludgeoning solid piece of sugary goodness  laura yes  liam the old fashioned swirly kind  laura yeah  matt with that you can make an attack with that as soon as it comes out make a melee spell  attack please /none/  laura okay 17  matt 17 does hit  laura ooh seven seven radiant damage  matt seven radiant damage nice as it strikes down wham from the creature already watching  its bones and its form shakes  laura oh wait oh wait oh wait i was looking at the wrong spell hold on oh 1d8 plus three  seven plus three ten  matt ten oh thatll be enough you watch as it pulls back with the infernal shouting of mollymauk  causing it to prepare itself for a lunge as it gets low its jaw snapping /dung/ open you watch as bits  of its skin fall onto the ground as it does so snarl and right before it leaps wham it just  smashes it into the ground and its bones go flying and scattering in every which direction  all oh  travis is that one of the werethingies damn  laura that ear is mine  matt all right so beau what are you doing you all have one round of prep right now youve gone  sam i cast a spell can i also move  matt you can move yeah  sam /none/ as soon as the arrows flew by im going to dash across the alley  matt okay  laura and im going to send my duplicate after her  matt okay youre

i can move 40 can i peek into this window  and see if i can see anything in here  matt /tavern/ sure easy to see in this perspective you glance inside  marisha stealthily  matt all right as you glance inside you can just barely see around the corner the place is  tossed it is shattered and ruined it looks like it was once the interior of a small tavern of some  kind but the kitchen is wrecked and you can see two of these gnolls are in the process of grabbing  large sacks out of the kitchen and pulling them out through the front door on the opposite side of  the building  marisha oh /none/ shit okay i turn to nott i go  sam look at two unicorns inside  marisha the gnolls  sam theyre inside the  marisha shh  matt i would like you all now to roll initiative  marisha natural 20  all whoa  marisha thats the second one of the night  sam oh wait is this an ability check  matt yes so these are with disadvantage  laura oh really  liam oh scheiß  marisha no good  liam that was worse  marisha oh no  travis german accent that was worse  /none/ liam that was already bad  laura initiative is an ability  matt it is  laura are attack rolls  sam and matt no  laura okay did i already ask that  sam nope dont worry though i touched all your dice so theyre going to roll great tonight  laura thanks thanks sam  taliesin he may have licked a couple of them  laura can you lick this one  matt 25 to 20 anybody  travis 25 to 20  marisha 24  laura im going to put it back over here im going to /none/ try it maybe itll roll really well with  your spit on it  taliesin its a very pretty die  laura its so pretty right  matt 20 to 15  travis 16  matt 16 all righty 15 to ten  taliesin nine oh nope never mind yeah  travis wow guys wow  liam mmhmm  matt all right ten to five  taliesin nine  laura seven

molly then jester then caleb  liam yeah  sam and nott  liam whatd you get  sam six  liam oh all together at last  matt all righty so top of the round as some of this has happened the one gnoll skeletal form has  shattered onto the ground some of the other gnolls begin to look over in that direction and  see a few of you over by the guards now standing up and darting over the way /none/ theyre preparing for  some sort of whatevers coming but first of the round is you beau  marisha i turn to nott  sam huh  marisha hey you want to take these guys you ready for this  sam panicked stuttering im going to drink from my flask  marisha get ready i want them to come to this window okay im going to go whistles through  the window try and get their attention  matt okay  laura right there  matt make a performance check  marisha to whistle not great not great at all /none/ three  matt all right the whistle has a bit of volume to it unfortunately with the sound of all the  breaking of furniture them all growling at each other and the general screams in the vicinity  its lost in the chaos its not necessarily a quiet atmosphere to draw a guards attention the  gnolls dont seem to care much for a whistle around the window theyre more focused on  grabbing and running out the front other way with whatever theyre taking  marisha is that my action or a bonus action  matt ill let /none/ that be like a bonus action well say  marisha bonus action  matt because you were waiting for something to happen  liam mercerful  marisha shit going in i jump through the window and before one of them leaves im going  to crack them with the staff right over the head  matt okay with a 40foot movement that brings you  marisha can i go in through the window  matt you do as you go through the window because theyve mostly shifted into the other room  now thats where you see them moving theyre /none/ not in the room thats closest to you so you go jump  through the window over the mass make your way through the living room and you watch as theyre  exiting the door you get all the way through  marisha i thought it was much closer than that  matt unfortunately no but you do manage to make it all the way to this door there  marisha oh theyre going out the back door i thought they were going out that way  matt nope  marisha okay  matt is that still what you want /none/ to do  marisha thats bad disadvantage fog of war  matt well heres what you do as you rush through to go after them as theyre fleeing out  the other side you come to the doorway and you can see theres one gnoll right in front of you  that hasnt noticed you rushing behind it its currently throwing a corpse of one of the  villagers onto a cart thats sitting right outside of that door that cart which is piled up with  other corpses and bags and whatever things they were robbing from the inside /none/ of this building that  theyve thrown onto this cart you can now see theres four gnolls that are gathered around it in  the process of throwing things onto it and it looks like theyre getting ready to start pushing  it they havent noticed your arrival as youve just darted into the doorway what are you going  to do  marisha okay im going to double ba ah i cant move anymore can i  matt no that was your move to get there  marisha im going to spend a ki point and do patient defense /none/  matt well as your action you can just go into it without having to spend a ki point  marisha oh really  matt because you already used your bonus action the ki point allows you to do it as a bonus  action but you can just do it as an action any time  marisha ooh great ill do that  matt you just go into the dodge action  marisha ill just hold back and wait  matt right so youre holding back in the doorway and youre ready to use the door to help  /none/ defend you if it needs to okay that ends beaus turn its now their turn  travis oh shit already oh god  taliesin yeah this is what was coming  matt they rolled really high in the initiative  travis what are we calling these things  all gnolls  liam gnoll  marisha i thought i was going to still be a lot closer to nott  liam sings gnoll  laura sings knoll  matt visibly off to the side there is  sam noll  matt yeah thats going to be two of them firing their /none/ bow actually no three because they  watched you come out theres three of them that are going to be firing their bows at beau  laura oh no  sam beau bow beau and bow  liam bobobobo bobobo  matt they all have disadvantage on the attack however  sam shes in patient defense shes going to be fine  matt as this one fires off in the direction of your duplicitous form as it disappears through  as its the only thing it can visually see its going to stay behind the wall thats three  attacks /none/ at disadvantage against beau  marisha and they all have disadvantage  matt they do  marisha because i did patient defense  sam youre going to be fine  matt first one with a longbow thats a 15  marisha miss  matt right misses the first one you watch as it just moves past you and slams into the door  the next one from this guy up here  marisha i immediately go whoops  matt thats a 12 and a two the other one misses into the wall this one over here is going to fire /none/  at you thats a 16 and a 14 plus three 17  marisha 17 is my armor class  matt the first two one hits the door the other one you duck out of the way and the third one  comes and its piercing right towards your chest its going to deal 2d8 seven points of piercing damage  marisha okay im going to use deflect missiles for my reaction  matt oh right because you got that for your okay as a reaction you watch this one arrow that  you cant quite duck out of the /none/ way  marisha grunting exertions  matt all right so go ahead and make the roll  marisha but its not super im still level three so its more like a cat swat  matt yeah youre trying to swat it and see if you can carry the momentum with it  laura 20  marisha that is seven on the dice plus seven 14  matt you reduce the damage to zero and you catch it  sam whoa  matt if you want to you can spend a ki point to throw it if you want to  /none/ travis oh throw that shit  marisha yeah lets do it just because i can  matt all right where are you throwing it to  travis in the foot  liam at the bitch who attacked you  sam or the guy in front of you  marisha im going to do it at the guy in front of me whos right behind me  matt okay  marisha so im going to catch it and im going to spin around in a full flourish and im going  to just throw it like a gambit card with the /none/ momentum that its got  matt all right so as you grab it you spin around and throw it go ahead and make the attack roll  marisha whats the attack roll  matt it should be your  marisha what is it ive never done this before  matt i know this is new  marisha its brand new  matt here we go you just make a ranged attack with it so roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier  and your proficiency modifier so same as any of your other attacks because it counts as a monk /none/ weapon  marisha okay 16  matt 16 hits it takes 1d8 so roll 1d8 plus two  marisha four four damage total  matt all right i wonder does it add your damage bonus to it or the original weapon because it is  your strength throwing it back pardon me folks while were figuring out new abilities they can use  marisha you make the attack with proficiency and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack  matt it is your attack so you get to add your dex bonus  marisha so six total /none/  matt all right so six points of damage you watch as the arrow just sinks into the chest of  its thick hide armor snarling  marisha i go hah ooh  matt the other ones that are throwing stuff onto the cart hear this commotion and turn around and  look at you three of them continue just throwing stuff onto the cart faster while the one thats  immediately in front of you spins around and stands tall you can see it looking down at you a full  foot and a half almost two feet taller /none/ than you snarling its going to go ahead and grabs a  spear off the side of the wall that it had leaning against and its going to try to thrust it at you  it still has disadvantage on the attack though because youre in your stance thats 16  marisha miss  matt this one as it goes and thrusts with the spear coming off of the adrenaline of the  deflected missile you duck low and then kick the spear up which slams into the top of the door frame  and completely misses you hes now /none/ stepping into the door frame completely filling it as youre  backing up into your space and the two of you are in this very intense small occupied block  marisha and i go no seriously dude did you see that  travis my legs are jumping around like crazy right now  matt these guys are going to begin pushing the cart and its going to move at half their movement  to there this one here is going to move up to here right around the side of this wall and its  going to take its longbow /none/ and fire at you because youre the one they can see  marisha thats fair  matt disadvantage that is a 15  marisha miss  matt this one actually you see over at the fire and you grab the front of the armor of the  gnoll and pull his in front of you and it actually hits the back of his armor splintering it and  the smell hits you  marisha i just go excuse me for a second thank you  matt as you let him go theres this thick oily horrible liquid thats matted in /none/ the fur and the  touch of its nasty the smell itself is very acrid of rotting flesh and mangy fur thats going  to end all those guys there theyre pushing there all right that ends the gnolls turn  fjord youre up  travis yeah okay with my 30 feet of movement can i wrap around the far side of the house and  just get to cover of the corner  matt thats exactly where you can get  travis now there is an individual over there that sucks right  matt correct you see it has /none/ a longbow and is currently reaching back and its pulling another  arrow and getting it notched up  travis i beg for forgiveness im going to try some shit i would like to cast  marisha were all trying some shit its okay  travis crown of madness  cheering  matt all righty so whats the save on that one  travis it is wisdom saving throw i believe let me doublecheck yeah wisdom saving throw  matt no thats an eight im pretty sure that does not hit  travis so he becomes charmed and a jagged /none/ crown of iron appears around his head and madness glows  in its eye  matt thats concentration correct  travis yes it is  matt im putting a concentration circle on you all righty the charmed target must use its action  before moving each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself you  mentally choose so it has to be a melee attack  travis oh melee fucking shit i saw the bows damn the words in this book  matt thats okay  laughter  travis but i can make /none/ him move towards something right  matt that you can  travis okay good im going to have him climb up on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll  thats up on that son of a bitch  matt okay since it has to use its action before its movement you watch as it looks up at the top  of the roof snarling and leaps up climbs scampers up to the side and gets right up into  base to base with this guy confusing the other gnoll who looks down at it like its about to /none/  help him and it doesnt seem to notice theres any sort of threat there but it cant make an  attack on this round  travis thats fair can i use my bonus action to use my mask of many faces to make myself look like  a gnoll no theyre taller theyre too tall  matt well theyre medium theyre not  travis two feet taller i can only do a foot taller or shorter  matt its cutting it close youd look like a small gnoll  travis id like to do it  laura a teeny /none/ gnoll  marisha hes the runt  matt you are visible to a number of gnolls in this courtyard you dont have any movement to  back away from that edge unfortunately  travis i was hoping to just be because i cant see that far to be right here to hit the only  guy that could see me on the ground there  matt right but youre right on the corner thats how you were able to see him and send him  this way  travis the guy on the roof can see me as well  /none/ matt yeah they can both see you just so you know the rest of them probably cant but you  transform yourself into a gnolllike appearance all right does that end your turn  travis that is it  matt all righty in the back of the alleyway one of the gnolls stands thicker more angry and more  ornate than the rest of the pack you see heavy scale mail armor across the torso and a large  helmet across its head you look as thick spines about a foot and a half to two feet long are woven /none/  into the scales themselves off the shoulders the back of the helmet and the sides of the armor  they look natural as opposed to metal like long bony spines that are put onto it both as an  ornate adornment or possibly just a means of defense and to look scary it begins barking and  steps forward giving motions to some of the other gnolls and the ones that are on the cart continue  pushing it as it steps forward  laura oh no  matt to there  travis i should have used it on /none/ that fucker  matt its going to go ahead and use  sam is that a crownsguard  laura no hes like a grandmaster gnoll  sam no the guy next to him  laura oh i feel like thats a zombie gnoll  matt its going to use incite rampage  sam oof what does that mean  matt it looks over towards the one thats right next to beau and goes snarling the one thats  in the middle of the area with you hears that grins and then gets an extra attack against you  with disadvantage /none/ and a four that defense is helping you out it goes to strike again and as  it comes out with its claw its putting its spear to the side  marisha i do a little duck  matt it misses you entirely thats going to end its turn at the moment then it goes to the guards  on this end these guards are going to fan out  travis raspy voice hey come on lets go  matt then they dart back around this way theyre going to find a corner next to you jester and  take /none/ a shot at the gnoll thats up on the roof next to the one that you have charmed shit  thats going to miss five plus five he fires and it goes wide you see it vanish into the rising  cloud of embers and flame thats going to end the guards turn theyre getting around and preparing  for the next round to shoot a volley  laura i pat him on the shoulder and say dont worry nobody saw that  matt they glance over their shoulder and is like shh molly youre up  taliesin im going /none/ to take a run am i going to do this am i going to be this idiot yeah lets  be an idiot im going to take a run to try to get cover at the other house im going to try to run  across the alleyway  matt this way  taliesin yeah  laura dashydash  taliesin dashydash  matt counting it will put you at about there  taliesin yeah  matt but thats your round  taliesin thats my round i just zooming  matt cool all righty that ends mollys turn jester youre up /none/  laura okie dokie im going to send my duplicate out against the wall on this house  matt over here  laura yeah against that wall she can go up to 30 feet and im going to run across  matt that space  laura yeah can i get against the wall further in yeah right there thats good  matt okay thats your turn you still have an action  laura oh yeah im going to use my bonus action  matt you currently cannot see anything for it to attack you need to be able to see /none/ a target for it  to attack something so youd have to be either further out you can do it as part of your  movement as you run across make it move and attack and then continue back  laura as im running can i use my spiritual weapon and  matt can you move it 20 feet  laura i think its 30 feet lets see 20 feet youre right im sorry 20 feet  matt which direction  laura towards the giant guy and hit him  matt make a roll  laura hit him with the /none/ rock 15  matt 15 unfortunately does not hit  laura boo  matt it just misses you watch as the shield comes up and deflects the large glowing mace of a  lollipop then you continue the rest of your movement to dart behind the building at this  point youve all pretty much shown your cards that youre here and part of this fight youre  the only one whos up in the air  laura for my action can i still see my duplicate around the corner right there  matt correct  laura she is going /none/ to cast  matt well you would be able to as youre running  laura okay she is going to use the cantrip sacred flame  matt against  laura against the same big guy  matt these would be things you would have done before you ran across  laura yes basically yes thats what i did technically i did this before i moved  matt just letting you know that usually you have to do that as part of your movement dexterity  saving throw that is a 12  laura good he has to beat 13 it /none/ hits him  matt it takes 1d8 points of radiant damage  laura yes it does four  matt after the shield deflects the lollipop the flash of radiant energy burns across the armor and  the torso instinctively it puts up the shield to try and deflect the blow from the eyes  screeches looks out and doesnt see where it came from but its singed a little that ends  jesters turn caleb and nott youre up  liam yeah okay i will move along the table over here to this spot  laura well thats one method /none/ to be able to reach  liam i think i have a clear view of the big gnoll correct from there  matt the big one you do  liam i mutter a few arcane words under my breath and a circle of flame spins around my hand and  three beams of fire shoot out towards this big guy i cast scorching ray each one is a separate  attack first one is a 16  matt 16 hits  liam second one is also a 16 the third one is a 17  matt all three hit  /none/ liam so 6d6 on him  sam 6d6  liam because they all hit thats four six  travis what dice are you rolling there big guy  liam nine thats the six  travis no your d20 which one was it  liam this one  laura thats the grog one  liam oh thank you counting thats a total of 19 fire damage on him  matt 19 points of fire damage as the three beams arc out and blast you see as the large gnoll who  seems to be a pack lord or leader of some /none/ kind sees this coming tries to put the shield up but  all three blast into its armor you watch as flames burn out of it suddenly as it withdraws  and takes a step back grows and howls it just looks angry it looks hurt a little bit but  mostly angry  liam i probably have ten feet of movement which i would like to use to move back to where i was and  try to not hyperventilate against the back of this building  matt okay  liam dead center yeah okay good  matt good /none/ to know  laura i like that youre facing the wall so it looks like  liam no im like this im doing this  matt nott youre up  sam notts going to poke her head into the window where beau is inside beau is within a few feet of  a baddie right im going to shoot the baddie next to beau 15  matt 15 that doesnt oh wait for a regular gnoll that just hits barely  all regular gnoll  laughter  travis thats all i heard  sam nine points thats including sneak attack /none/ damage plus fury of the small so 11 points of damage  matt well its your level right you went up a level so technically  sam ten points of wait what did i say nine 12 thank you  matt 12 points of damage as this gnoll is in the process of slamming through the front doorway the  doorway has been bashed inward on each side and beau is in the process of dodging and weaving and  getting out of the way you find one opening and fire your crossbow bolt it goes through the  window /none/ through the doorway bisecting the two different rooms and straight under the clavicle  near the heart section of it as it pierces in screams and it coughs up a bunch of blood onto  the front of its hide armor its not dead but its pretty hurt that was a pretty nasty blow  sam movement i will use to climb up into the second floor window thats not me the one next  to your right there you go  matt go ahead and make an athletics check  sam that was good but its disadvantage thats better /none/ athletics its a straight ten  matt ten is exactly what you needed that was the dc to get up onto the second floor as you come up  into the second floor you immediately climb and leap up through the window into a chamber that is  filled with roaring flame  sam screams  matt trying to avert your gaze the heat is pressing into you theres a table thats on fire  most of the roof has been burned away theres beams that have fallen youre like this was a  bad idea  sam i say /none/ this is fine  laughter  sam can i use my dash was that all my movement  matt no that was your movement to get up there and you could use your bonus action if youd like to  sam okay ill use a bonus action to get is towards the window less fiery  matt its still burning but youre going to have to leap over the flames to get there  sam sure  matt ill say make an acrobatics check to try and leap over parts of broken  sam it was two threes  matt /none/ you make it across you leap onto the first beam and it breaks youre like ah that burns  you leap again onto the next one ah that burns too eventually you get over there your boots  are on fire and youre having to pat them out real fast you suffer five points of fire damage  getting across the room  sam rough  matt but you are in an area where it seems its just embers and most of the flame is catching  behind you for the moment you get the sense that it might begin /none/ to spread in the next minute or so  but at this point youre not immediately in the threat of flame and you have a look down into the  entirety of the courtyard with a little bit of cover in fact it would be considered half cover  up in here  sam half cover im done hey look at that its me in the window  matt at which point you can see the skeletal gnolls that are out there all at once turn and  begin shambling forward theres one this way that begins to run up /none/ and take a swing at your  duplicitous form before striking out with no effect this one spins and comes up into beau and  then theres one that emerges from  laura im going to point out ive been doing it wrong because i was thinking of my duplicate as  like trinket was which had movement the same as me and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate  which i did not realize im going to stop doing that  matt thats okay we learn what the new abilities do  laura yeah i just /none/ looked it up and im sorry  matt thats all good  sam so your duplicate is somehow less useful than trinket is that what youre saying  laughter  liam she doesnt give a shit about that bear  matt out of the doorway here another one of them bursts through and runs to the back and sees the  direction where jester is in the process of glancing over to the side  laura oh thats real me  matt it uses its action to charge up into combat with you it cant actually make an attack this /none/  turn but its right up to you its gaping vacuous skull open sockets trying to bear down  on you thats going to end their go except for the one thats striking at you beau  taliesin theres one on the roof still too  matt well thats not one of the skeletal ones thats going to be with disadvantage 17 to hit  marisha 17 hits  matt 17 hit it bites out towards you with its broken toothy jaws and you suffer six points of  piercing damage as the jaws clamp down on your forearm and /none/ youre like oh god its pushing now  to try to find the space next to the larger gnoll and theyre both currently blocking the doorway  from your escape  marisha im doing the animal control thing and be like no no bad  matt which by the way top of the round beau your go  marisha my go okay let me put these hit points in apply changes  laura this makes my duplicate way less fun if i cant move her  taliesin you get bonus actions all the time  laura thats my spiritual weapon /none/  sam she may move if you move away from her 30 feet she may just come with you  laura 120 feet  sam oh shit but you can leave her out in the open  laura yeah at least shes directing fire  marisha okay im going to do something creative im going to take the arrow that nott just fired  into the guys chest im going to grab it can i rip it out with my offhand spin around and stab  him back in the blade  matt awesome go ahead and roll for your /none/ main attack  marisha god blessed fuck thats not good thats a ten  matt you pull it out theres a horrible pained yelp as you yank it out as you spin around and  attempt to slam it into its back its giant thick gnoll arm slams into the door frame and blocks  your ability to pass forward you get caught over its arm and have to withdraw  marisha okay im going to take my other offhand attack on the one that just bit down on me im  going to rip from it and elbow crack /none/ it right in the nose  matt the one that just bit you all right go for it  marisha damn it thats 11  matt 11 11 doesnt hit unfortunately lot of whiffing on both sides when it comes around beau  but as you attempt to strike out with the elbow it does strike its skull and its jaw unhinges and  snaps it back into place  marisha shit that was my bonus action wasnt it  matt yep  marisha i cant use a ki point can i  matt as a bonus action you can /none/ use a ki point to do two as your bonus if you have it flurry of blows  marisha i was wanting to do a ki point to do patient defense again  matt no you used your bonus action sorry you want to move or you want to stay where you are  marisha yeah can i back up into the house and close the door  matt the door frame is pretty banged up you can try you can certainly try  marisha sure  matt taking a step back one has spears so youre still in its /none/ melee range as you try and  close the door theyll both get attacks of opportunity on you if you do that  marisha no ill stay  matt okay so you stay there holding your position that ends beaus turn the gnolls go  before we do anything the one thats right next to the guy on the wall what do you want it to do  travis melee so if he has a weapon or anything hit him if not just knock him the fuck off the roof  matt he has a spear or you can make /none/ a shove up to you  travis spear  matt all right so the spear attack its going to as it climbs to the top and lunges out with  its arm go ahead and make an attack roll for me  travis oh okay plus anything  matt it is plus five  travis thats a 20  matt sorry plus four  travis thats a 19  matt 19 definitely hits go ahead and roll 1d6 damage plus two two hands technically so that  would be 1d8 sorry  travis yeah thats much better nine  matt /none/ nine nein it jams the spear with both hands into its friend and the gnoll yelps and grabs it and  pulls it out and looks at it confused and angry trying to figure out what exactly happened as it  does so its going to attempt to shove it off the wall that just hit it make a roll for the  athletics check of the other gnoll  travis adding my modifier or its  matt its modifier  travis 16 plus  matt 16 plus two it beat it it rolled a 17 after it gets stabbed /none/ and looks back at the gnoll  that you took control and spartakicks it off of the edge of the roof it slides and tumbles down  landing onto the ground prone right next to molly it does suffer one point of falling damage molly  you watch as it tumbles and hits the dirt next to you and its like groans you watch as this  mystical crown of weird iron horns are floating above its head  taliesin is this  matt that takes up his turn this guys going to move forward and advance this is unfortunate /none/ for  beau partially this one is going to fire at beau this one actually can see nott and this one  is going to take a shot at nott as well so one attack against you beau from that gnoll there  thats going to be 11 misses it actually hits the wall and embeds itself into the side of the  door frame the two attacking you nott you do have partial cover on these guys half cover will  be plus two bonus to ac the first one is going to be a 20  sam hits /none/  matt the second one is a natural two the one that does hit you you suffer nine points of  piercing damage a lot of nines tonight as the arrow suddenly arcs upward and hits you right in  the side of the jaw and carves through part of your neck that way before it exits out the other  side you have this big gash on the side it doesnt quite hit the jugular thankfully but it  is pretty messy as you are starting to bleed down the side of your neck  laura isnt she harder /none/ to hit because shes so little  matt yeah but that one had some decent aim these guys here continue to push forward that way  and theyre going to use their other action to push forward this guy is going to go ahead and  throw another body up onto this as the other ones pushing it they dont get quite as far because  one of them stopped pushing but theyre getting to the edge of the map the one thats snarling  there is watching them vanish behind this guy around the edge is going to lets /none/ see seeing you  yelp up in the window hes going to take a shot at you beaus currently being dealt with two of  them and youre up in the flames right now that is going to be a 15 which i do not believe hits  sam no  matt this one strikes the ember wood on the outside and breaks through but it only comes  partially out and is embedded missing you by an inch that finishes the gnolls turn i believe  oh this guy is going to turn and take a swing at beau /dung/ with a spear two hands that is a 16  marisha miss  matt 16 misses it swings out and you actually catch the spear off to the side and youre now in  a strength tug of war with its own weapon as its  marisha my stick mine drop it bad do you want to play or not  matt ending their go it goes to fjords turn  travis crown of madness piece of shit can i go ahead and send using my action to maintain it  can i send that stupid ass back up the /none/ roof  matt let me doublecheck something  taliesin the damage may have  travis knocked it out no  matt i dont know if thats the case its not just that it already moved on its turn it takes  its turn you have to spend your action to maintain the spell so it wont do anything on your turn  so either you continue to maintain the spell and then next turn its still under your control or  you do whatever you want  laura or you drop it because hes prone and molly will get super /town/ advantage on hitting him  sam super advantage  taliesin yeah i dont know what the crown is  travis fuck it ill drop it and ill come into the street down the way 30 feet but i look like  a gnoll  taliesin concentrations gone  matt oh thats right thank you  travis but i still look like a gnoll  matt yes you do  travis that will be my turn  matt all righty are you holding your action to do anything  travis i guess because i dropped it i have it  matt /none/ you have your action because you didnt maintain the spell  travis with my action im going to cast hexblades curse on that big son of a bitch  matt this guy  travis yeah  matt i believe its a bonus action to do that isnt it  travis it is  matt so you still have your action  taliesin you could even make it to get into his face  travis with my action i will eldritch blast from where i am  matt go for it make the attack roll  travis thank you skadoosh its /none/ a 15 plus six 21  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis amazing 1d10 counting sorry i shouldve looked at this beforehand 14  matt 14 points of damage as you rush up you watch as this squatter gnoll saunters out in the  middle points to the seeming leader of this cluster and as it does the soot and ash from the  ground begins to affix itself around the inside of its armor holding it in place for the moment  with the other hand holding the suddenly appearing barnaclestudded blade you unleash  /none/ this blast of eldritch energy that slams into the center of the armor you watch as the energy  courses through all of the crevices between the scales that are overlapping as it fades you  watch as this bit of steam and blood come out of its mouth and it turns right to you its head  turning it spits a cluster  travis yipping  matt well get to that thats your turn  travis thats it  matt okay its his turn now now it shrieks and growls  laughter  matt and goes running and rushes /none/ up towards you you watch as previously it just had this large  pole on its back it pulls it and brings it loose as you see a large twohanded glaive come swooping  which doesnt actually it can get to there and still hit you because of its reach as it runs  forward it brings it down its going to multiattack you twice with it  travis okay  matt first one is going to be a 21 to hit  travis oh thatll hit  matt and a 17 to hit  travis both hit  matt /none/ both hit all right  travis thats okay ive got the armor it deals damage when you hit me  liam and laura ooh  matt that is eight points of slashing damage on the first hit wham as the large polearm the  axelike hooked blade at the end of it you can see the same spines that are on its armor are  affixed to the edge of it as it slams down towards you the armor bursts this cold energy  that how much damage does he take  travis i got ten temporary hit points at /none/ second level so he takes eight points of cold damage  matt slick second strike he rolled a one that is going to be four points of slashing damage for  the second strike  travis so hell take two points of cold damage and ill take the other two points  matt nice  marisha you have so many fun gadgets  matt oh he does get back his incite rampage at which point hes going to go ahead and glance  over towards the gnoll that is hmm  sam the grassy gnoll  matt the grassy gnoll /none/ yes thank you sam  travis thank you sam  matt all right yeah the only one that they can currently see thats in melee range at the moment  because the walls there is going to be the one next to beau  sam no really thank you sam  matt sincerely so after it strikes you twice with the glaive bits of ice shards spray off with  each blow now affixing to the ash and the energy thats instilled this armor after you blasted it  it looks over to the one right in front of beau /none/ and goes growls and snarls and it glances over  its shoulder and with renewed strength pulls the spear free from your grasp and goes for another  strike against you as a reaction  marisha bad dog  matt that is going to be a 19 to hit  marisha how much  matt 19  marisha that one hits  sam how many are engaged with you right now  matt two  marisha three two  laura shes so wanted  matt thats going to be seven points of piercing damage  liam apologies to my friend /none/  matt all righty thats going to end his turn and the guards back here are going to come forward and  travis oh lets go this way  matt theyre both going to fire at the one on the rooftop  sam travis and taliesin hey  laura laughter and a miss and a miss  matt first ones a miss second one is a 16 that hits  sam hey  matt its an eight plus two so thats ten points of damage based on the crown of madness damage it  took earlier the spears enough to /none/ finish it off you watch as on the top it goes and draws an  arrow and pulls it back looking down at you as youre down in the square then one of the guards  pulls its crossbow and shrieks it stumbles back and falls dead on the ground  travis here we go  matt that ends that one the other guard over there theyre going to go ahead and move up the  side and step out now that it seems to be opening and is going to fire towards the skeletal gnoll  that is currently /none/ in the process of harassing the image that as far as theyre concerned is just  jester its going to be yeah that hits without issue  taliesin im not used to melee combat this is so terrifying  laura yeah right  travis get up in that  taliesin i dont want to get up in that  travis get a whole bunch of stank right in your face  matt pulls out the heavy crossbow and fires and does 11 points of damage which is enough to  shatter the skeletal gnoll witherling as it falls to the /none/ ground and breaks into a scattered pile of  bone bits and dried gnoll flesh that ends the guards turn molly youre up  taliesin im going to stab this thing that just fell right in front of me just going to stab it  matt it is prone so i believe you have advantage against it yep with each attack  taliesin question about rite of the dawn is it just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it  also a  matt wisdom bonus is against undead creatures  taliesin okay this is not /none/ an undead creature  matt it is not there are undead creatures among the pack but there are none there its just  straight rite damage  taliesin so its just an extra 1d4 okay just checking thats how that works okay cool  see if i hit thank you 13  matt 13 unfortunately misses the first strike  taliesin oh my god  matt as you swing down onto the ground it scrambles about and pulls its shield up just in  time your blade catches the edge embeds itself an inch into its rear  taliesin i /none/ hit it with the other one  matt you use your one blade to push the shield off to the side as its still there and trying to  jam downward go for it  travis definitely hit  taliesin come on oh thank god 21  matt 21 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis chanting level three level three  taliesin so thats nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage you manage to jam underneath and hit it in the chest it shrieks with pain  and pushes the blade out of its body /none/ with a sheer flexing of its muscle it begins to try and get up  off the ground its hurt but its still standing or about to be standing in a moment you can move if youd  like to  taliesin yeah thats right i can break combat with it it doesnt matter right at this point  or does it get an attack of opportunity  matt it does get an attack of opportunity but it has disadvantage on him  taliesin theres no way i can circle up onto the wall is there  matt onto the /none/ wall  taliesin yeah get a little vantage on him  matt you could  taliesin i want to be able to hop on because i want to head that direction afterwards all right  matt you get up onto the wall  taliesin and that way if he tries to run or do anything i can futz with him  matt cool thats fine molly your turn is over jester youre up  laura yay im going to run away from this guy thats next to me im going to run out into the  alley so i can /none/ see people  matt this way  laura yeah  matt as you rush out it takes a swing attack of opportunity towards you this is going to be with  a club it has a heavy wooden club and it makes a giant arc towards you as you speed away that is  19 to hit  laura can i use a reaction on that  matt you can yeah  laura im going to say i am rubber and you are glue and use hellish rebuke on him in infernal  matt all right well first the club /none/ hits you and you take five points of bludgeoning damage  laura okay  matt as you turn around you say that at him and unleash your hellish rebuke he has to make a  constitution saving throw i believe it is right  laura maybe hold on  sam you have to save first  laura im applying my changes to my health  sam now close out of that  laura this is so much  matt it has to make a constitution save no thats dexterity saving throw which it does not  make its seven so /none/ it suffers 2d10 cold damage so how much did you deal  laura oh 2d10 okay nine  all nine  taliesin this is becoming a thing  liam so sorry guys there you go  matt as you dart away you release your fury and anger and you watch as suddenly this blast of cold  water and ice energy burst out of its body the inside of its somewhat cavernous ribcage is now  filled with frost crystals jutting out and breaking parts of the ribs it looks heavily  damaged but still standing  laura ooh chilly /none/  matt all righty  sam you still have your action right  laura i know and my bonus action  matt yeah  laura so for my bonus action im going to send my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit  him at the same time im going to cast what am i going to cast radiant no guiding bolt  matt okay  laura

 laura oh good so thats 20  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage for spiritual weapon  travis nice  laura wheres my eight six plus three is nine  all nine  matt this is absurd guys this is absurd all righty does that end your turn  laura oh im going to use the rest of my movement to run over and try to get behind this /none/ wall  matt youre from over there thats counting 20 you have ten more feet you can get there  laura thatll work i was going to go to the brick wall  matt oh the brick wall youll get up onto it  laura yeah sure why not  matt its considered rough terrain so you technically cant get all the way on the other  side you climb up onto it that finishes your turn as you finish blasting with the guiding  bolt at the same time as it slams and sparkles you watch as the lollipop /town/ clubs down onto the  back of its head that ends your turn caleb nott youre up  liam okay i start moving back towards the same vantage point i had before and i see jester above  me and i see a guy over there covered in ice and i whip around and the diamond comes up and i go  sizzling and i was about to make it acid but theres ice everywhere so its ice now chromatic  orb off to the big guy in the middle of town square yeah  matt go ahead and make /none/ the attack roll  liam it misses entirely  matt it spins and hits the ground you watch as ice crawls up the side of the building i will say  it does manage to put out part of the fire that is currently burning the building  marisha you did a good thing here you did good today  taliesin you made lemonade way to make some lemonade  marisha you just got the participation trophy  liam then i use the rest of my movement to press my back against the wall and go nein nein nein  /none/ matt as you move out where are you at now  liam still behind the same building  matt you dart out and fire and then back all righty that ends your turn nott  sam just a little perspective here the gnolls pushing away the cart how many are there and  what are they  matt there are currently three that are gathered around it and in the process of pushing it  theyre getting momentum as its going  sam no obvious weak points on the cart or anything  matt make a perception check it will /none/ take your bonus action to do so  marisha take out a wheel  sam its going to take my bonus action to do so then i will not look at the cart  taliesin it will move slower if we kill them  sam im sure it will but i dont know if i could kill one in one shot instead i will using my  goblin feet claws just dig in and im going to go upside down so i can see into where beau is and  shoot one of the ones next to her  laura /none/ you can do that  sam i dont know  matt as you dig in and hang down you watch as your hood and hair hangs upside down you pull the  crossbow down the tension of the bolt is holding it in thankfully otherwise it would just fall  from its upside down standpoint and you fire you can go ahead and make a strike  technically you have two that youre in view of here they both have threequarters cover because  of the nearby door and the angle  sam the ones next to her  matt /none/ yeah  sam ugh well i got to hit them  matt which one are you shooting the skeletal one or the  sam the one that i hit before  matt okay so that one go for it  sam that is 17  marisha i think that hits right  matt 17 would hit if it didnt have threequarters cover which gives a plus five bonus  to ac  marisha oh poopers  matt unfortunately its just the large part of the door frame in the way theres beau in the  way and theres a lot /none/ going on in that moment as you go and fire it just zips past and slams into  part of the now broken door thats coming off the hinges  taliesin man i hate level three  sam cool im going to go pop back up to the top floor and use my bonus action to hide  matt all righty go ahead and make a stealth check  sam nope ten  matt you get down low but your hood and hair are now frizzed and poking out the side that ends  your turn nott this one is /none/ going to rush forward pursuing jester that one is going to  attempt to continue to whale on beau thats going to be a 15 against beau  marisha miss  matt misses you just duck out of the way as it tries to bite you and slam your elbow onto its  snout knocking it out of the way just holding on holding off in this doorway the one that runs  up towards you is going to attempt to hit you again with a club that is going to be a 19 again  laura ugh  matt /none/ oh thats a d4 sorry thats six points of bludgeoning damage whack as the club hits you in  the back of the head as youre just climbing over the top of the wall you have to catch yourself  from tumbling face first into the dirt on the other side you manage to catch your footing on  top of the wall but its now up and in combat with both you and the guard from earlier  that ends their turn top of the round beau youre up  marisha oh god okay im going to taste a /none/ little bit of blood thats now in my mouth get real  fucking pissed off and im going to do a star warsstyle flourish and go crack down to the new guy  matt the skeletal one theres a skeletal one and theres the one thats been fighting you this  whole time  marisha which one looks like he has less damage  matt the skeletal one hasnt been damaged yet but it looks a little more fragile the one that  got shot by nott earlier still has the big  marisha lets do the skeletal guy  /none/ matt go for it do the attack  marisha not good at all 14  matt that hits doesnt have as strong an armor class as the other one  marisha okay eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage that ones already been damaged previously as you bring the staff  down with both hands whack you slam right through the center of its chest and clavicle you  watch as the torso breaks and folds from the weight of the blow the skull tumbles off and hits  the ground and it falls into a pile /none/ of bones and rags  marisha im going to use my bonus action with that momentum im going to stick the staff in the  ground and use that to lift myself up and do a twofooter kick into the other guy  matt go for it single attack  marisha lets do flurry of blows  matt all right so this is your third ki point  marisha nope this is my second  matt right because you did the no because you did flurry earlier didnt you  marisha i did but i did it as an action /none/ not on a bonus action and you said i didnt have to use  a ki point  matt no a flurry of blows i thought  marisha i did patient defense i did one flurry of blows  matt you did the dodge action as an action which doesnt take any ki points you spent one  doing a flurry of blows earlier  marisha i spent one doing deflect and then one to do flurry of blows  matt this is your third one  marisha no this is the second one this is the first flurry of /none/ blows im doing  matt im sorry thats what i was asking my confusion cool so go for it  marisha shit i dont remember this was what i rolled right okay not good ten  matt ten against him nope as you kick both feet forward one hits and skims off the shoulder the other  marisha the other is okay 15  matt 15 just hits go ahead and roll damage  travis singing pour some sugar on him  marisha seven  matt seven points of damage all righty based on the damage that you had sustained /none/ earlier and the  blows from earlier as you strike him with the other foot you snap the side of his jaw which  breaks out as he stumbles backward you take the back of the staff and crack up underneath the jaw  snapping the neck the rest of the way and it falls to the ground no longer moving you still  have your movement  marisha now im going to look around and im going to step back and into the house for just a minute  sam into the house  taliesin this is fine  /none/ marisha this is fine just so i have cover right in the doorway  travis just going to take a quick timeout  marisha quick timeout  sam

asshole  matt its okay stands up  taliesin man im normally the one with shaky hands  matt thats more because these walls are not the most sturdy /none/ there you go stands up to you this  one is going to step forward into the way this one is going to join in there those three now in  visual range these two are both going to take shots at jester this ones going to take a shot  at fjord two longbows aiming in your direction thats a 20 and a natural one the second one  misses you suffer eight points of piercing damage as the arrow sinks right into your torso right in  the stomach area and pierces through you catch it with your /none/ hand but its still a few inches  into your actual midsection then theres the one over here that turned around and sees you now  engaging with the current pack leader  travis but im a gnoll ah  matt thats a 15  travis im just confused that hits  matt thats going to be six points of piercing damage this one now slams into the side of your  knee and hits the meaty part so thankfully its not locked in the bone or any of the joint but it  hits you in the side and /none/ you buckle to that side from the pain  travis understood  matt this guy over here is going to leap down and begin helping push the cart  all no  matt with that the cart pushes another full 40 feet and is currently off of the board let me  mark it over here  marisha how do we feel about the cart  laura we got to get the cart  sam i can take a shot at the cart but what is one arrow going to do  taliesin we can take out people pushing it /none/  matt that finishes the gnolls turn

matt 13 to hit which i dont think hits  taliesin no it does not hit  matt you on the wall dance off the way leap as it goes up all right and i believe thats all  the gnolls immediately in the vicinity that are in combat that /none/ ends the gnolls turn fjord youre up  travis yeah great awesome sweet can i use eldritch blast against the big fucking guy  because he didnt get any closer for a melee attack right  matt youre still within his attack range because he has the glaive you do have  disadvantage on eldritch blast  travis oh imma fucking move out of his attack range does that give him attack of opportunity  all yes  travis yeah im doing that anyway im going to move back towards the corner where i was going  matt right there /none/  travis no all the way back back towards my original hiding place  matt you pull back to the corner there as you pull back he takes a step forward and reaches out  with the glaive to try and strike you  sam does he have any disadvantage or anything  matt nope that is a 23 to hit  travis that hits  matt that is going to be ten points of slashing damage as you back away arcs downward  travis i will now out of his melee range eldritch blast ugh god thats not great /none/ 13  matt 13 does not hit now that its seen the blast after it strikes and grins you hear this  hyena chuckle under its breath you turn around and go to strike out with the eldritch blast and  it pulls one of the other gnolls nearby and yanks it in front of him just as the shield takes it  off then sets him back in place deflects it with its own guy  travis nice as im pulling around the corner can i use my bonus action to drop the stupid  runty gnoll look  /none/ matt you dont have to spend a bonus action you just drop it pulling back from the fire yeah  you can get just around that corner the guard lets you by  travis i need cover  matt that ends your turn the leader at this point makes this loud gibbering sound that echoes  throughout the alley turns and runs off to pursue the cart  sam he left  travis were at level three thats got to be an acceptable option right now  sam no  laura that means we almost killed him thats what that /none/ means we almost had him  marisha do we chase after him  laura yeah  matt that ends his turn the guards now who have notched their crossbows again are going to take  shots at both of those guys right there

you swing and it ducks out of the way and attempts to  strike upward with its spear as you do you knock it to the side with the scimitar that missed and  with your other hand /none/ strike down right across its face you arc through and you actually carve one  of the eyes in twain you see a large red mark where youve split part of its face and its hurt  really bad but its still standing theres gore dripping out of the socket where its ruined eye  sits snarls  taliesin im going to try and circle around it to get out of the way of the archers im going to  hop back off and get behind him  matt you can do that without a problem you leapfrog off of /none/ him grab his shoulders and land  behind him scimitars at the ready okay ending mollys turn jester youre up  laura what about the guards  matt the guards already went oh she didnt fire sorry thank you for reminding me about  that the other guards did go she did not they did not  laura arent they going to attack this skeleton one thats right here next to both of us  matt they throw their crossbow to the ground and pull out a morningstar and does a sideswipe  towards this that is a 19 well /none/ say that straight up hits that does five plus eight points  of damage to that one i dont think youve damaged that one yet right  laura yes i had i did the hellish rebuke to it  matt thats right you did that was the wrong one all right with that they swing backwards  with the mace and hit the side of the skeletal head which shatters immediately upon impact  ruining its form and is no longer part of the battle  laura i am so surprised i fall off the wall  matt you are /none/ you tumble that way  liam get out of the city  matt all righty jester your turn  laura okay are either of those two gnolls over there damaged  matt from what you

sam okay  laura eight  sam sad trombone  laura sams spit not a good luck /none/ charm  matt as it swings in the air and spins they both take one step back and it hits the dirt and they  both look at each other and chuckles  laura shit im going to cast cure wounds on myself and then im going to leap off the wall  with great flourish and land next to caleb okay thats a good idea im going to land next to the  guard then im going to skip away to the building  matt there you go all righty that ends jesters turn caleb nott youre up  /none/ liam okay im just going to do my same dog and pony show trick im going to go to the corner i  should be able to see two or three gnolls i think over there yeah  matt yes over here  liam okay so sizzling starts to burn in my hand chromatic orb out to hit whichever one  matt that ones probably the easiest to see right now  liam then thats the one im going to go for come on oh thats good thats a 17  matt that definitely hits  liam thanks keyleth  /none/ marisha youre welcome boo  liam that is 3d8 so where is my eightsided die there it is this is fire and it is 11 points of damage  matt as it bursts into it you see the fur burn and singe and whimpers pats it out and the  flames subside you see its charred and burnt and you see the flesh is cracked and blackened  its injured but its standing  liam okay and i inch back again and say singing if it aint broke dont fix it and  hide behind the building  matt that /none/ ends your turn nott  sam theres two gnolls in front of me that i can see right  matt you can see those down there the one just got blasted with the familiar fiery explosion of  calebs chromatic orb the other is untouched  sam the other one i will point at and i will remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and  crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and move it around over the crumbs and say hey what  happens to a frogs wagon when it breaks down it gets toad /none/ away and i will cast hideous laughter  on the gnoll  travis hideous indeed  marisha no bad halle berry lines  marisha and laura what happens to a toad when its struck by lightning the same thing that  happens to everything else  matt wisdom saving throw that is a natural 11 what is your spell dc  sam 13  matt 13 all right  taliesin i like the theory that he doesnt burst into laughter he just holds the groan pain  liam i would like to think that he does laugh hideously and despises /town/ himself for it  matt did you shoot the one who was blasted with the fire or the one that was untouched  sam the untouched one  matt you watch as the one that was currently untouched that was drawing another arrow glances  up and hears and goes uncontrollable laughter and falls to the ground manic laughter laughing  this horrible hyena chuckle and its billowing out into the street clutching its stomach and  dropping its weapons to the side and just rolling on the ground its friend next to it is like huh  looks up /none/ and sees you  sam okay all right ill use my bonus action to hide  matt go for it  sam oh i have to stealth oh god damn okay thats 13  matt okay that ends your turn there are no more of the undead types so theyre off the thing  beau youre up  marisha okay i step out of the burning building sauntering like a badass john woo film  liam doves go everywhere  matt thats five feet of movement  marisha yeah and looking at this one i go hey your friends have /none/ an inside joke without you  pointing at the guy on the ground as soon as he turns i go whack like a baseball bat right  across his head  matt as soon as he glances over to the side he looks back just as youre already in his face  marisha oh thats good  liam swing it high beau  marisha 25 no sorry 24  matt 24 thatll definitely hit roll damage  liam swing away  marisha im going to take that thats a 13 sorry ten nope 11 math  matt 11 points of /none/ damage whack you watch as about five or six gnoll teeth go flying from the  impact the jaw quivers as spittle and blood goes careening off the side of the impact it falls and  stumbles if you want to follow it up  marisha im going to using that momentum do a helicopter flourish above and go crack down over top  matt go for it  marisha thats a natural 19  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  marisha oh wait this is technically an offhanded  matt right so its a d4 for /none/ this one but were using the staff for a flourish  marisha ooh thats a four so eight points of damage  matt eight points of damage wham as you bring it down over the top of the head it falls and  gets up its dazed and beaten within an inch of its life its ready to go its barely standing  at this point one eye is lolling around and trying to find and the other one is swollen shut  now and cant actually see anything its in a bad place  marisha fuck ill hold  /none/ matt okay that ends your turn beau the guy on the ground is just laughing his ass off at the  end of its turn its going to try and make a saving throw no that is a two it is still  laughing on the ground this one seeing the rest of its allies run turns around and is just going  to run  sam thats the one you just hit  marisha no this here  sam how many are over there oh i didnt see it  taliesin two and ive got one  matt this /none/ one seeing another one flee is going to attempt to try and flee after you get an  attack of opportunity  marisha i have advantage on that  matt you do not  marisha fuck oh but thats still good 18  matt that hits roll damage  laura kill him  marisha is that with my regular attack  matt yes  marisha eight damage  matt you knock and crush him to the floor as he tries to run you whack and hit him and you watch  him take a few steps and skid and fall /none/ onto the ground and hes not moving the one over here  who is not currently in the process of knowing that everyone else is fleeing because hes been  stuck over here is going to try to take a spear attack at you molly  taliesin im going to snap at him im going to use blood maledict  sam hellish snap  matt which is good because he rolled a natural 20 on the first roll  taliesin yeah no he aint  matt disadvantage that brings him to a 15  taliesin that is my armor class /dung/  matt so it just hits you  laura but at least its not a critical attack  taliesin nope  liam all his friends are running away and hes going me and my friends are going to kill you  matt eight points of piercing damage its eyes go dark and it pulls back and still it seems its  sense of smell can still find your placement in the vicinity and as you pull out of the way it  still manages to find you the spear pierces right around where the hip is and you pull back /none/  gritting your teeth thats going to end its go  travis my turn  matt yep  travis can i hop around the corner again  sam engine revving start up the full  travis ill go ahead and use my 30 speed to close in on the pronedout great and ill use eldritch blast  against that  matt all right it has disadvantage against it because its prone  travis 11  matt 11 as its rolling around on the ground its difficult to find a proper shot and you  fire and it hits the dirt /none/ next to it sending a bit of dust over it it stops laughing for a  second as the dust he laughs even harder at the actual dust  travis thats it thats my turn  matt that ends your turn all right the guards go the leader continues to run and is now  disappearing into the smoke and ash you dont have a visual on the cart at the moment its now  pressed into where a lot of the fire is and its obscuring their escape these guards are going to  move forward as they load /none/ their crossbows and theyre both actually because hes on the  ground laughing youre coming out on the roof theyre going to turn and fire at the one thats  in front of molly it does have threequarters cover because of the wall theyre trying to help  you out  travis we need the assistance of guards guys  matt hits the wall and deflects  travis its hard  matt that does hit that is a 21 actually so that does even with the bonus to armor class from  the threequarters cover it still hits  sam /none/ those guards are killing more than we are  matt with that as its there in front of you with its spear after stabbing you it pulls back  and one crossbow bolt out of its forehead  its jaw goes slack and falls to the ground dead  taliesin oh come on  sam dont you want to ask that nameless guard how he wants to do this  matt well theres still one left on the ground which well say for the purposes of narrative  here who wants to do this  travis what you really want /none/ to do something  sam is it our turn soon caleb and me  liam yeah  matt well when we come back around it would be mollys turn jester then caleb and nott so  whatever you guys want to do in this moment before it comes back let me know  sam i would like to jump down from the wall and run as fast as i can after the leader and the cart  travis really  marisha and laura whoa  matt make an acrobatics check  sam oh disadvantage jesus 11  matt you jump /none/ off the side and you land you do suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you  hit the ground and your feet buckle and you actually slam and your face hits the dirt but you  use your momentum to scurry back up and beginning to move forward you get and if youre using the  rest of your  sam dash everything  matt i need you to make a concentration check by the way  sam oh  matt make a constitution saving throw because you did take  sam this is a saving throw thats not /none/ disadvantage 16  matt yeah so you maintain control over the hideous laughter okay you rush into the cloud of  ash after them and you begin to see some of the shapes ahead of you of the gnolls there pushing  the cart youre still behind them by about 30 or so feet and right as you rush forward darting  in the heat from the embers entering your lungs burn and you put your mask over to block and help  filter a bit with the cloth and bandages and right as you rush forward you see the /none/ back of  the heavy armored leader thats bringing up the rear of where the cart is and he turns and sees you  sam oh god  matt as soon as you finish your movement it spins and looks in your vicinity to see that  youre alone  sam oh god  matt takes his glaive  sam oh god  matt and closes the distance with a giant downward swing  sam oh god  laura what did you do  taliesin wait is it his turn already  matt at this point the narrative timing on /none/ this  taliesin because i was going to run that way too i thought we were still  laura yeah  marisha yeah who was allowed to run  matt well notts after you  taliesin okay so i will  laura but we didnt get to go because nott just jumped it  sam yeah  matt all right cool all right well lets roll it back a little bit here and see how this helps  you all right cool so no its fine so jester molly what are you guys doing  taliesin i was going to /none/ run to see where the cart was going full dash  matt okay as you sprint off with a full dash you dont quite get as close as nott does  taliesin no i wouldnt  matt because nott is much faster  taliesin is he triggering my spider sense at all  matt no  taliesin okay  travis whats your spider sense  matt its not really a spider sense  taliesin i know but you know  sam but its a spider sense  laura basically  matt youre about that far back i would say  /none/ laura i was going to have my duplicate go over and touch the guy laughing on the ground and cast  inflict wounds  matt go for it  marisha dope  matt its a melee spell attack correct you have advantage on it because hes currently  incapacitated  liam if hes still around when shes done i would have done my same single  laura natural 20  liam yeah  travis thatll be all the damage  matt oh my god so roll the dice  marisha hes going to turn into powder  laura five six /none/ 13 26  matt as hes laughing your image walks up with a skip bends down and touches him and he suddenly  withers into this completely driedout husk of what the gnoll once was the life force drawn and  cast out of his body he stops laughing and the body falls like a mummy to the ground  sam your duplicate can cast spells  laura yeah thats why its more fun if i can move her  taliesin thats why its like a bear  matt all right finishing those turns back to the top of the /none/ round  liam no i would have leaned out if i had seen it was dead and no enemies i would use my  movement my action to move further up to the corner not much besides that but join where  fjord and the duplicate are thats it  matt that ends your turn  travis your friend took off running  liam nott  laura thats all happening right now  liam this is simultaneous  matt beau your turn  marisha hearing you say that im going to be like i guess were race you im going /none/ to take off  running after nott  matt okay  marisha 40 feet speed  matt you manage to catch up right around basically where molly is there do you have a ki  point left  marisha i do  matt if you wanted to use your  marisha that would just get me ill save it for right now but i can see nott and i can see the  guy and i can see the cart  matt theres cloud and ash embers pushing into the atmosphere now the nearby building are  actually in flames /town/ and engulfed on the side here  marisha that was a double move  matt that was a double movement to get to there  marisha all right  matt as you and molly are 15 20 feet from each other and ahead you can see the shape of nott and  you can see the leader of them you can now see from nearby buildings that about ten other gnolls  are all gathering around the cart and theyre all leaving theyre all carrying giant sacks on their back  dragging bodies and corpses behind them  marisha ten /none/  matt yeah this wasnt the only gnolls that attacked the city  taliesin this was just our little patch our gnoll patch  matt finishing beaus turn it comes back to fjord the rest of the gnolls continue pushing the  cart a few join them giving it momentum about six more of them begin stepping up  flanking the leader whos now staring at the three of you  taliesin nows not the time  travis ill run forward using my 30 feet but i will call out nott get back here  sam what dont blow my /none/ cover  travis let them go  sam okay what  matt that ends fjords turn the leader sees the three of you there puts the glaive away with one  hand turns around as he draws his longbow and fires an arrow right at you that is a 17 to hit  sam hits  matt that is eight points of piercing damage  marisha are you down  taliesin he is so down  matt the arrow strikes nott in the chest who falls unconscious onto the ground the ash and  embers starting to spill over her /none/ unconscious body with that because i believe yeah it can  make two attacks with its longbow hes going to make a second strike now this ones going to be  at im going to make it he cant decide at the moment thisll be a four molly that is a  natural 20  groaning  matt that is 18 plus three 21 points of piercing damage  taliesin you got to be fucking kidding me really  matt he rolled a nine on a d10 and its a crit  taliesin oh im down  matt molly goes /none/ down  sam oh shit  matt with his movement he puts the bow back away and keeps walking with the rest of the gnolls  marisha i grab fjord and i say just wait wait let them go  matt you watch as all of them turn around and they all begin to gather you hear this cacophony  of different gibbering cries in the distance as theyre all starting to call themselves back to  leave the city they all step into the clouds of smoke and ash in the distance before eventually  all the shapes disappear /dung/  marisha i want to watch them as far as i can to try and pinpoint a direction that theyre heading in  matt okay make a survival check in this moment  liam its dark too  matt it is dark  marisha not great 11  matt okay its hard to tell with all the smoke you cant see the moon you cant see the  placement of the sky but you make a note of which direction theyre traveling based on the street  those who are both on the ground as beau continues doing this you /none/ guys begin to rush up and you see  both molly and nott on the ground  laura i run up and ill cast cure wounds on molly then im going to run over and do the same  thing at level two to nott thats six points of healing for you im sorry  taliesin thank you  laura ill run up and cast it on nott oh no nott i pull her up into my lap oh thats good 13  oh 13 plus five no plus three  matt that immediate first breath is filled with pain /town/ both from the wounds youve sustained and  the immediate influx of burning ash that sweeps into your lungs both of you come to consciousness  sam gasping oh my gods  taliesin what were you thinking  sam i was just going to follow them from afar i forgot they had bows and arrows  taliesin thats literally the only thing thats been happening  sam i thought they wouldnt see me because of the smoke oh boy  taliesin im going to put out these fires oh im not getting up  marisha ah shit the town you /town/ guys and im going to go back and start trying to put out the fires  taliesin im going to crawl back towards the  matt as you guys begin to regather your troops more of the crownsguard that you see have been  battling and have been partially wounded by a lot of the other gnolls are beginning to gather their  dead beginning to try and put out what fires they can and acknowledge which buildings cant be  saved as you begin to take

kickstarter you can find on wyrmwoodgamingcom to look and see the cool thing this new release is  going to entail so thank you very much wyrmwood all right with some of the flames dying down 30  minutes or /town/ so of the chaos descending the crownsguard begin to come back those that are  still living many of them wounded and tending to their wounds or helping the survivors that are  still within the town you see some families are starting to unblock their entranceways and the  people who had escaped the city are slowly beginning to filter in you can hear the sobbing  in the distance of families that are coming back to homes that have been destroyed the smoke still  chokes the air and at this hour now its probably pushing close to /none/ 1100 or later but as the guards  come through and begin to take in the essence of whats happening the armored individual that helped you  when you first arrived and gave you the command to aid in this approaches you see their halfelven  face solemn and tense approach and extend a hand there arent many who would immediately  jump into the fray as you did i would say that we would have lost many more and perhaps all of my  men had you not been there so thank you  laura of course i say /none/ as i cut off the ears of some of the gnolls  liam you beat me to it you said 30 minutes went by i wanted us to be doing that already  marisha were like oh no put out this fire  laura these people have lost everything  liam i was just waiting for you to pause  matt yeah no worries unfortunately for the three skeletal ones you only manage to get one  full ear  liam thats fine  laura thats okay because we got two ears off of all the other ones  matt /none/ you did well say for that for those who wouldve been destroyed or damaged let me go  ahead and roll and see how many ears youre able to pull off of those bodies  laura im also going pull off a chunk of tail and see if it will pass  liam id like to think that we leaned down to the same gnoll cutting and went same hat same hat  matt you manage to pull up about 12 ears intact between all the fallen bodies some you killed  some maybe you didnt you came across the /none/ body elsewhere in the square and just took the ear  marisha i totally remember kicking this guys ass  matt other guards are collecting them as they go and there are a couple moments where someone was  going for an orc or a gnoll that you had killed and you went to the guard and went nuhuh and  they backed off but anyway the soldier head that was speaking with you extends a hand and they say i  am watchmaster bryce feelid assigned here to alfield now in my fourth year thank you  marisha watchmaster /none/  matt watchmaster bryce feelid  travis what were those creatures have you encountered them before  matt weve encountered them before yes in smaller hunting packs maybe a halfdozen at a  time usually on the outskirts they dont come to civilization like this its generally too  dangerous for them in the smaller numbers they travel what the fuck are they after  travis such a grizzly scene they seemed to be carrying away bodies on that cart they had  taliesin that was weird  laura did you notice they had some undead gnolls with them  /none/ travis i did  taliesin there were  laura have you ever seen anything like that  matt ive maybe crossed one or two as part of the roving packs its not terribly uncommon  taliesin what turns them like that is there something in the water  matt i have no idea i dont know the ins and outs of their creepy bestial lifestyle i mean  what and you watch as they sit down for a second leaning against the wall thinking and  scratching at their chin word came of a small hunting party of these beasts /none/ spotted to the  south so we sent a small troupe to slay them naught but two hours before they struck here we had sent  more than half of our mens strength to go and deal with them so we were unprepared and at the  time unguarded for the most part we were caught at half strength it cant be a coincidence they  must be desperate to assault headon like this theres plenty of small game in the  surrounding wood and theyre known to be provoked to violence but ive only heard of gnolls picking  /town/ off the outlying folk those that wander too far from the fields  laura do they eat the bodies  matt they eat what flesh they can get a hold of but we went through a number of the buildings and  theyve ransacked two of the inns they completely took the entire butchers stock theyve carved  the city of whatever meats fresh or dried we had  taliesin word came word came that they were in the south where did word come from  matt word came from some of our crownsguard who were running a patrol  /none/ liam we have seen these things as far south as trostenwald further even  marisha has there been something else going on that you can think of that might have cut off  their food supply  matt not that i can think of for the most part this far south other than a few runins here and  there they arent conflicts of this size dont make it past bladegarden  marisha bladegarden  matt its where most of them its where most of the empires military and guard are trained and  then sent out throughout the rest /none/ of the valley thats a lot of meat that theyve acquired from  us and theyve lost many i thought of their kin in this battle as well  laura too much meat what are they feeding  matt or whats making them so hungry  laura oh or that  travis indeed my concern is that theyll return weve fended them off for now but theyll come back  marisha especially if theyre as desperate as you say they are  matt ive sent three of our scouts to try and find out where they went track wherever theyre /none/  taking their spoils reports come in that most of the bodies they took were dead perhaps not all  we have to do our best to at least recover any survivors wipe out what remains and prevent this  from ever happening again  marisha have you heard local farmers complaining about them stealing livestock missing livestock  matt im going to look into that actually im sorry im still gathering my thoughts  laura gasps wc i get up and i run and see if our horse is still there  marisha oh wc  matt okay so /none/ you charge out to the far city and you do find wc still affixed to the cart  currently chewing on a small bag of oats where one of the families of villagers who fled have come  back and begun to feed him  laura thanks man thumbs up to the family ill run back to the group  travis are you going to run back to the group or bring wc with  laura no im going to leave it out there  travis oh cool okay  taliesin petting zoo  laura yeah theyre petting him  /none/ matt to the rest of you bryce says well as rash as it was said and our coffers are not as  strong as they could be i will request more of a monetary influx up north for the ears you have  taken you will be paid any more that you find those will be paid as well  taliesin well and were going to need some lodging anyway so perhaps some trade could be  worked out  travis indeed we could provide some extra muscle perhaps for some lodging while we stay and  maybe we could /tavern/ aid your men and their efforts to exterminate this foe  matt well i would normally put you up in the candleglow inn but they gesture over towards the  large building that you had walked through thats now currently  taliesin its literally glowing like a candle right now  matt that is ironic now that you point it out  taliesin i feel really bad for saying that out loud  matt lets just not let thadeus know that his life is  liam i have a question after listening to this for a while i start looking /town/ around the town would  you say that with all these burnt buildings everywhere that if i start picking through the  rubble i would find enough charcoal to reduce the costs i would need for find familiar  eventually because i still need the incense and the herbs but if i get a lot of charcoal from these  burnt homes  matt i will say if you take 30 minutes to find good pieces of charcoal and roll an investigation check  liam yeah  travis nein  liam yeah done and done thats good and i have /tavern/ a good investigation too that is a 23  matt all right you manage to reduce the cost of you next find familiar spell by three gold pieces  liam yeah good thats good  matt from the hopes and dreams of alfield so bryce looks at you i can have you put up at the  feed and mead tavern  sam feed and mead  matt feed and mead tavern its not the most comfortable place but itll do  marisha its a good name  matt i did not name it but pass it on to crute /none/ the owner  travis crute  matt tell him that bryce sent you and you are being put up by the crown for as long as you are  hunting these creatures  travis we appreciate that hopefully there wont be another call to action while theyre here but  you can count on us if there is  matt of course well they reach into a pouch and begin to count out the gold for the number of  ears youve collected with twelve ears  laura 360 gold  matt mmhmm  marisha dope  matt after bringing /none/ the ears forward they glance over actually ill be right back i may need to  acquire a bit more change and after a brief wait bryce returns and you are paid the full amount  travis damn  matt so 360 gold at your disposal  sam should we divvy it up equally  laura if we do thats 60 gold apiece thats laura talking  laughter  marisha im fine with that  matt bryce says we hope to hear back in the morning of our scouts findings if you wish to  if you can hunt whatever /none/ remains of these creatures and bring back proof that theyve been  wiped out ill see what i can have sent southward of zadash to make it worth your while  marisha in the meantime you wouldnt have anything that might help us and our little  expedition would you healing potion might be nice if you got one hiding away somewhere in a  closet forgotten  matt i dont mean to be brusque but at the moment i think we have a number of our guard who  are in more desperate need  marisha fair  laura /town/ i can help them in the morning  laughter  matt im sure that would be appreciated for the moment you all look about as battered as i feel rest  up come lets see they would be at meet me outside of the broad barn  sam the rod bawn  matt the broad barn  laura the broad  matt barn broad barn  they point it out to you its on the western side of the town there well make sure  you get the basic supplies necessary hopefully well have information on where to go and /none/ if you  so choose we could conscribe you to be under our intent to destroy these creatures think on it  rest well speak in the morning bryce turns around and limps off with a few of the other  crownsguard as you guys eventually find your way to the feed and mead you are immediately met by  crute who is this ornery saltylooking dwarf of tousled whitegray hair this single tuft of a  beard that dangles down towards the belly button before it hits a ring of gold goes oh so ive  been told youre /tavern/ the ones who were coming to sleep got one of our two rooms for you  sam one  matt he never quite makes eye contact with you hes looking at your shoulder or right above your face  sam i think hes got two glass eyes  matt come ill show you turns around and leads you to your space there are four beds  jammed in here its like a youth hosteltype living situation here but its functional  laura are they doubles fulls queens twins  matt they are pretty much as twin bed as you can /tavern/ get  marisha and taliesin im fine with the floor  travis im great with a bed  liam ive already got the silver thread out and i am looping it over any open window and by the door  taliesin was there beer downstairs was there ale  matt you can go ask  taliesin im going to drop my things and run downstairs  matt okay you come downstairs and theres nobody inside this is not a tavern night for a lot of  people right can i help you  taliesin is there drink is there smoke /none/  matt smoke we dont have but drink that i can give you  taliesin ill take something interesting  matt interesting you say heh takes out a bottle looks like a deep green glass and uncorks  it takes a small shot glass that has a bulbous bottom pours it to the very top with this liquid  that looks a deep seateal green and slides it forward  taliesin fast or slow  matt well depends on how much you like to dream  taliesin how much  matt for that and for what i heard you did /none/ its on the house  taliesin nonsense  matt for the night you want more youre paying topshelf price  taliesin whats topshelf price  matt for that drink there that would run you about three silver  taliesin i put a gold on the table  matt not going to complain  taliesin consider it an advance its been a rough night for everybody  matt right right of course  taliesin and im going to sip this mother  matt it has a very smoky oakbarrel flavor to it at first as it hits your tongue and then /none/ it burns  into this very medicinal herbal almost anise mixed with burnt charcoal  taliesin that sounds nice im going to sit and sip this and grin and very silently have a mild  nervous breakdown about what just went down  matt okay as you all slowly come to rest exhausted sore beaten trying to fall asleep to  the distant muffled sound of shouts and wailing in the streets  laura and matt and jester jumping on the bed  travis jester  matt you find yourself to rest preparing for what the morning may hold and /none/ thats where were  going to pick up for next weeks session  laura worst roommate ever  liam youre not the only one caleb is going one gold two gold three gold 60 gold  laura 60 gold caleb  liam this was a
