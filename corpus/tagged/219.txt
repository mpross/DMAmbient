surviving their encounters in darktow  traveling to and from urukayxl and managing to release one of the gathered orbs of ukotoas  sealing you made your way to the depths of the divers grave and recovered the third of these  orbs that youve come across two of which now reside within fjords person you /none/ then proceeded  on towards what you believed to be the location of one of these temples through a series of visions  youve had by ukotoa i knew it was coming you made your way towards this archipelago looked  around set your ship in the center cast water breathing on the group and you all dove down  beneath the waters and found this slightly angled ruin this partially crumbled temple that sits  there at the base of the ocean floor you saw long straggling pieces of seaweed slowly waving  with the water and what looked /none/ to be drowned bodies tangled in them that upon your approach  began to clamber towards you you fought off a number of them managed to clear that space and  then investigate within the interior of this temple tower looking inside with a bit of light  there looked to be some sort of large mutant crustaceanlike creatures all gathered up on the  inside not entirely certain of the number just a series of claws and armor and barnacles backing  away you all just set yourselves on the ocean floor about 50 60 feet away from the /none/ base  doorway and thats where we left off so mighty nein lets go ahead and roll initiative  travis oh shit just getting in it  liam i forgot how to play  laura i know i did too  matt well you better hurry

were all together about 50 to 60 feet away from the base of the tower  liam this is after /none/ lighting up the inside and then backing away from it is that how it went down  matt you were clambering on top of it looked inside and then moved off of the edge  laura thats the door that im seeing right here  travis yeah we sent in the dead guy through that door is it just on the other side of this greefy  greefy sure  laura the greefy right there yeah  matt a little greefy like that greefy  travis i like the water i like the water  sam is there a door /none/ on the other side  travis we should kick up a bunch of sediment and hide  matt what you know right now theres just this one door here and a lot of cracked sections of the stone  laura didnt we have no did we was that a different time

are we doing  marisha what are we doing whats happening  sam should we go in and investigate through one of these cracks  marisha do you want to flank and we can kind /none/ of peek in  sam sure  marisha do a little scouting  travis i mean clearly the top is the damage right  sam is the damage what does that mean  travis well i mean theyre big we think right  taliesin we saw them  travis theyre not going to come through that little door right  marisha the crustacean things  travis the crustacean things of which i think there are three  taliesin we dont know how many there were a lot of them moving around  matt you saw a lot of movement inside /none/  sam why dont we get close to the door in case something comes out and well ready our attacks  marisha okay  taliesin i was going to say its been a while i thought the plan was to draw things out through  the door  travis it was  taliesin okay  sam oh then thats works well for our previously aforementioned plan  marisha yeah lets do that nott and i will get in position flank the door and hold our attacks  in case something runs out  sam if we can get that far /none/  marisha yeah  matt 15 20 for you for one movement  marisha go ahead and use my bonus  matt you can use your action to get over here if you want to or you can use a ki point and bonus  because its half movement  marisha right and then hold my action right so ill do that and use a ki point  matt okay nott  sam i will use action and bonus to get over thereish how far can i get  matt thats as far as you can get  sam okay /none/ and im somewhat obscured by the aquarium  matt maybe  sam okay and ill hold action of the tinkertop boltblaster in case anything comes out  matt you guys slowly bound along the seafloor your feet gently pushing into the silt soft  against the base of your foot you both flank around each side of the open doorway preparing  yourselves for any sort of physical interaction ending both your turns that brings us to caleb  what are you doing  liam i am going to use my movement to get behind this rock and i am /none/ going to about 30 feet away  from nott hold the haste spell for the moment i see her starting to attack something  matt to beau  liam no to nott  matt to nott got it finishing calebs go  sam healing potion so you marked that down  liam yep  travis its further around than you think  laura what  marisha none of us can really see  laura oh the door  matt theres a faint pause as youre holding back and preparing your spell two elongated  bluishgreen hands peer through some sort /dung/ of a humanoid looking creature but its skin somewhat  of a deeper bluer tint than the fish humanoids you had battled on the way in you see it kind of  peeks through and glances out toward those of you who that are currently still visible across the  way its face humanoid eyes a dull sunken yellowishgreen color but where its mouth is  its two flaps of skin like a central mouth that is vertical peeks out you see rubbery dark  tendrils that pull off of its head like a thicker predator just beyond the interior /none/  laura inside  matt on the inside yes  liam i was ascared and frightened  matt as it peers through its jaw opens up splits open you can see two rows of teeth on the  inside and the bony projections that holds it open and gives it this six foot wingspan of open jaw to  each part it gives this dull screaming noise as it begins to dart forward  travis six foot  laura from the doorway from where  matt from the doorway first off immediately nott and beau you were holding actions go /none/ for it  marisha slamming  laura ew look at it  marisha natural one laughs happy 2019  travis what the hell is coming off of it  liam trigger caleb casting haste on nott if i saw her attack  matt correct so for the time being you are considered hasted and caleb you are  concentrating on haste  sam but that doesnt apply until my next round  matt correct  sam okay i rolled a 26 to hit  matt that does hit  sam okay do i get sneak attack or does she see /none/ me he it  matt apparently it does not see you and its adjacent to beau at the time as it rushes past  beau it seems more focused on the group in the back so your attack does hit and you do get  sneak attack  sam okay that is 18 plus eight thats 26 points of no plus five sorry 25 points of damage  matt 25 points of damage  sam yes  matt you got it as the creature begins to skulk through and kicks off the stone outside of this  temple it swims /none/ at a faster speed than you were expecting and as it darts past beau beau swings  but goes wide no impact with the staff you however use that moment watch as the bolt from  the crossbow sinks into its chest it braces a bit but keeps darting forward using the rest of  its movement to go  marisha i turn to the group and i go ones coming your way  travis yeah we fucking see it  sam i turn to the group and go ah  matt its a unique sound because you hear notts /none/ scream go ah right as its voice roars it  screams out this highpitched threetoned whine that causes all of you to reach for your ears i  need everybody within 30 feet to make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin you guys get an extra d4  laura yes  sam we do  laura you dont  travis natural 20 for fjord  laura beau yasha and fjord  taliesin get a d4  laura it went 19 and then went to one  marisha jeez louise  travis a 13 for yasha  marisha oh and i /none/ get to add a d4 from being blessed okay 11 still not good  matt yasha and fjord are all right beau the rocking pain in your head causes your vision to go  white and your muscles seize up and you are stunned for the next round caleb  liam 15  matt you just barely manage to shrug it off no issue nott  sam six  matt as you feel the adrenaline burst into your system and you begin to move backward preparing  your next bolt it sears into your brain and your scream immediately cuts /none/ to a halt as your lungs  hold in place jester natural one you as well find yourself doubling over here your feet  pulling up towards your chest as you float and drift to the side clutching yourself caduceus  taliesin 13  matt you just manage to shrug it off it hurts and your hands go to block it but as soon as you  shake it off your eyes focus forward thats going to end its turn that brings us to fjord  travis im going to use my 30 feet of movement with my mariners armor /none/ and im going to move  north on the map as far as i can  matt 30  travis great  matt you guys can swim so there is an up and down if you need it  travis i will with my bonus

travis damn and a 15  matt /none/ 15 does hit  travis ooh thank god for that  matt the first one it sees you move and you see its brow furrow realizing that you werent  impacted by the scream the first one it ducks out of the way it spins around and you catch it  with the second hit  travis ten points of eldritch blast damage  matt you got it fjord that ends your go jester you are stunned  laura i am  matt but you will have your next turn it only lasts until the end of its next turn /none/ as you sit  there grasping at your head you can taste iron in your mouth mingling with the ocean  laura i bit my tongue  matt that brings us to caduceus  taliesin wow i see how this is going im going to cast bless and hit caleb nott and jester  matt okay so all you guys have bless now you have dual bless most of the party this is  actually a pretty good combo  taliesin so im blessing that and then im going to move out of the way im going to go around /none/  that rock and over to the side there yeah anywhere i can get over there get a little bit of distance  matt along the ground  taliesin yeah probably go up a little bit i want to be able to keep an eye on things  matt thatd put you at about there all right that ends caduceus go at this point you hear  this scratching sound skittering the doorway that was right there you watch something claw and  tries to pull through and then shoves into it the stone around the entrance breaks open and /none/ the  entryway opens slightly as bursting forth  sam oh god what is that  laura oh god oh jeez  matt one of the creatures from the inside that you had seen before  travis what is that what the hell is that  matt you saw a glimmering hint of it looking below but you see this large crustaceanlike  entity that has heavy pincer claws its face descends into tendrils these tiny little  tentacles that writhe and curl under its mouth it has a pair of four legs very arachnidlike that  scurry across the /none/ ground another one skitters up to the top  laura oh god  travis oh jesus  matt and another one from the inside  taliesin no not cool  laura no how did they get all the way up can they climb walls  matt they can swim too  laura they can swim what were we thinking  matt the one thats next to beau is going to take two strikes at you with its pincers  beau im stunned  matt you are so thats advantage  sam is that an autocrit  matt no stunned is /none/ not paralyzed paralyzed is different than that thats a hold person thing  that is a 24 to hit you take from the impact on that one dual sixes on two d6 thats 16 points of  bludgeoning damage and you are grappled the other attack is going to be 18 to hit  marisha miss  matt miss  marisha yep my armor class is 19 bracers  matt as you pull back even though youre stunned it grapples you with one hand and goes to  try and grab you with the other and you just manage while /none/ still stunned to pull just out of  its grasp however you are grappled so its going to use its tentacle attack on you as well  you need to make a constitution saving throw  travis if we hit it do you think it might break the grapple  matt usually you have to try and pull somebody out of a grapple or push it away from them  laura but shes in claws shes grappled in claws  marisha oh thank you gil 21 plus a four from bless so 25  matt as it pulls you in /none/ with its grappled claws tentacles begin to reach towards your shoulders  and neck and like a jellyfish you feel the sting hit you but you manage to just writhe enough away  and whatever toxin that is trying to release and pour into your system doesnt actually find  purchase within your internal body  marisha ugh no im not into that no  matt thats their turn that brings us to yasha  travis yasha will advance on el aqua screecher gentleman and she will unleash two swipes with  the magicians judge with her bonus action she /none/ would like to rage  matt there you go good memory  taliesin a d4 attached to each attack

slightly and bits of dull grayishblack liquid begin to fill the  area around it its head streaks back and its tentacles go wild and you can see from the inside  a strange series of clear tendrils that come out of an interior mouth theres a brief moment of  this really creepy alien physicality but yasha is focused and raging and swinging the blade as  hard as she can ending her turn bringing us to he top of the /none/ round beau and nott you guys are up  sam ill go first i dont know how powerful they are but i dont think i can kill one on one shot  we got to get you out of this grapple  marisha so sorry im so sorry  liam its okay its just my teeth  matt oh buddy  sam oh no hes had the worst luck i think seeing the predicament that beau is in im going  to cast phantasmal force against one of the ones that is grappling her  matt okay lets see here /none/ its an intelligence saving throw they are not intelligent  sam i assumed  matt that is cocked that is a 12 minus three nine  sam good so they fail  matt which one of these and what do you create  sam it doesnt much matter i want one of them to drop her grapple im going to do the one closer  to me and the image that they see and feel is that of a tiny goblin girl jumping on its face and  biting it in the eye i can roll for damage  matt /none/ yes you can  sam they suffer three points of damage and they have a goblin on their face covering their eye  travis both of them or just one  sam just the one creature  matt well get to what it does on its turn but yeah as soon as you complete the spell its head  suddenly jerks back twice three times you get the sense its had effect  sam because im hasted do i get a second attack okay i will now attack the other one with my  tinkertop boltblaster oh wait do i /none/ get to add a plus four  matt you are blessed i believe right  sam yeah one okay thats something 17 to hit  matt 17 hits  sam okay and sneak attack  matt yeah because its adjacent to beau  sam 26 points of damage  matt is this the same one that has phantasmal force  sam no  matt the other one how much was that that was  sam 26 points of damage ill do fury of the small thats an extra seven what are we at now  matt yeah an extra seven /none/ 33 points of damage in one strike the other one thats holding onto  beau shes still being pulled apart from the two different claws shes about to be bishopped the  secondary one as its not freaking out its tendrils are trying to reach around her face  suddenly the side of the bolt jams into where you imagine an ocular socket would be in a normal  creature as it impacts the head jerks back little bit of cloud of blood pools off of it and  it looks over in your direction  sam then i will /none/ very conspicuously bonus action fire again thats 26 to hit  matt that hits rogues man  sam plus another ten points of damage  matt nice a second bolt hits it it looks back in your direction with a second bolt now theres  two of them sticking out the side of its face two of the tentacles curl up around them wrapping  onto whatever purchase it finds on its face trying to pull it out that ends your turn you  want to move  sam ill move into the bushes there i know i cant hide /none/ but towards the tower  matt you move in ducking into the mix there perfect that ends your turn caleb youre up  marisha i havent gone  matt oh thats right beau  marisha im still grappled by both of them though  matt you are you cannot move unless you break the grapple its an action to attempt to escape  travis are you grappled by both  marisha mmhmm  matt a successful grapple attempt would be against both of them but theyd both get to roll  to try and keep you grappled its only one /none/ action to try and break from both if you wanted to break  free up to you  marisha that sounds like a waste of beaus time  matt fair enough respect that  marisha she is holding on going to start swinging wildly from where she is shes going to  hit the  travis smoke bombs something  marisha smoke bombs dont affect their grip  liam and were underwater  marisha the one that got phantasmaled okay plus seven jesus 23  matt 23 hits its with disadvantage right  marisha no  matt roll with disadvantage /none/ on these attacks  laura add four no  marisha its a one  matt first swing snaps onto its armor your knuckles crack in the instance and you feel a  sharp pain through your wrist make your next attack  marisha what else can i do is there anything else i can fucking do here okay  sam patient defense whatever that is  marisha i mean i can do it on my but i still get a second attack here okay 18 plus one 19  matt 19 hits roll damage  marisha same one thats good /none/ nine damage im going to spend a ki point to do stunning strike  for the love of god  matt constitution saving throw its a plus three but its a natural four seven  marisha stunned  travis that helps a ton  matt it drops the grapple the grip that it has on you laxes as suddenly the area where you  managed to jam the fist right underneath the jaw causes part of its throat to collapse inward and  its at the moment not sure where it is you feel that one release the other one /none/ still has you  though thats your action you still have your bonus  marisha im going to do my bonus does patient defense matter if im grappled  matt yeah all grapple does is lower your speed to zero you cant move restrained is what really  fucks you up because that gives advantage on attacks against you  marisha okay copy yeah ill do patient defense ill look at the other one and grab his  claws and stare him in the eye  matt where its eyes would be you imagine trying to look for an eye /none/ to glare at perfect that ends  your turn beau caleb youre up  liam i was backing away from the action but seeing how the things are turning south i start  pushing back towards miss lionett through the water i make it that far and im going to cast  magic missile at level four  matt 4thlevel magic missile  liam counting 22  matt 22 points of damage against which one  liam the one thats backside is to me this side no the one on beauregard here  matt you got it perfect 22 points /none/ of damage on that each one impacts the shell darkens from the  blasts as all six bolts you fullon robotechstyle missile into the sides of it  theres a series of small dull explosion sounds in the nearby water before it goes still its  still moving and shifting around but its head is thrashing about wildly seemingly distracted by  something you cant see  liam thats the end of my turn  matt now its their go the one that is still holding beau releases her and begins scrabbling  towards its face it manages to strike /none/ out and clasp nothing natural 20 critical hit on nothing  as its striking out in the direction of its face trying to clear this little goblin off of its  visual cortex its tentacles reaching out to nothing it moves and shifts this way to try and  scrape and get off its going to wreck it there does it get to make a saving throw at the end of  each of its turn  marisha does it move out of my range  sam let me look each round on your turn i can deal damage my /none/ god this is a longass spell  matt it does it doesnt get to save every turn it looks like but it lasts for a minute you can  continue to do damage to it it thinks its real but its starting to wonder as its done a few  hits that should have snatched this thing up its finding no purchase so you get the sense that  maybe the illusion is starting to youve gotten a round of distraction from it ill put it that way  sam while the target is affected the spell treats the phantasm /none/ as if its real the target  rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the phantasm  matt so its just a quick little goblin  laughter  travis i love that they wrote it out that specifically  matt yeah interesting so its more frustrated that its taking damage from this little creature  but the damage is negligible its now like fuck it  sam got it that makes sense i buy that  matt this is me rationalizing its rationalization  sam yeah no that makes sense  matt you manage to get her free of the /none/ grapple  marisha did he hop out of my melee range  matt he did  marisha pop pop sentinel  matt go for it  travis is that going to turn him back around on you  marisha well natural one doesnt and a natural 20  sam then this is the one that misses right  marisha no i rolled a natural one  matt oh you rolled a natural one  marisha yeah i rolled a nat one and a nat 20 so he moves  matt he does move its fine  travis thats okay i /none/ think thats actually better keep him going  matt and taliesin this is fine  matt that one shoots past that one here towards caduceus actually i looked at the wrong order  theres a few more turns before they get a chance to go well say that happened if it gets to it  that was actually the initiative for the creature that youve already killed fjord youre up  travis fjord will take all 30 of his speed and head towards the two lumberfucks thatre messing  with beau  matt same height or are you lowering yourself /none/  travis id like to get down there if i can  matt you can get into melee ill say with this one technically both of them you can get to both  of them  travis could i im going to send and one of thems stunned right  matt it is yes  travis im going to take two swings with the summers dance falchion at the stunned one that  just let go of beau  matt you gotcha both attacks are advantage against the stunned creature i believe yes  travis they stay at advantage because /none/ of my mariners armor  matt correct  travis 15 thats going to hit thats 30 yeah i mean that hits thats 37 without the  matt yeah that hits  travis ooh god double fours plus 12 16 20  matt 20 hits damage for the second strike go for it as you swim down quickly falchion  whack slicing across it  travis 11 on the first seven on the second 18 points total  sam beau youre still

tough decision here  matt i know  laura heres the thing  taliesin im fine man  laura are you though  taliesin yeah im fine  travis youre wearing cowboys colors its fine take your time  laura im going

liam character drops fuck this bullshit  matt its a constitution saving throw  laura its a wisdom saving throw  travis everybody is ready to be out of the water  matt that is a 14  laura /none/ oh i get it 12 points of bong damage  matt beautiful the area around its head where theres an armored shell that protects its face  area cracks a bit from the impact bits of its shell are starting to flake off that ones  starting to look pretty hurt  laura these things are tough yo i thought that was going to kill the one with yasha  matt are you going to move or stay where you are  laura no im going to stay  matt that ends your turn then caduceus  taliesin man things /none/ are happening yeah im going to turn invisible  marisha everyones at such a loss  laura these guys are really tough and theyre so spread out  sam yeah theres four of them  taliesin thats only for a round then im going to back away from this thing im actually going  to head around behind jester basically  matt it will make an attack of opportunity on you as it sees you disappear it goes out towards you  it has disadvantage on the attack that is 17 to hit  taliesin that misses i also might /none/ add that i have the shield of retribution  matt you do  taliesin im going to activate the shield of retribution  travis this is the first time  taliesin yep its the first time im using it when a creature misses with a melee attack you  may react to the blast with arcane force you have to succeed on a strength saving throw but thats  something else  matt roll damage first  taliesin okay eh 14 points of damage  matt 14 points of damage nice the strength saving throw is a six  taliesin /none/ it must succeed on a strength saving throw is a six i dont know what against must  succeed on a strength saving throw against something  matt thatd be your spell dc  taliesin then i think thats fine yeah you get pushed back 20 feet  matt blasting it gets blasted back from the impact you see a flash from the shield and this  bubble of energy well up and then force it back with a sudden impact as it gets pushed away you  dart around the side  taliesin i dart around the side im /none/ coming as far back as i can towards that wall and im going  to hold my actual action to do the same thing with yasha again to give her the bonus kick to her  first attack  matt thats your action  taliesin that will be my action yeah  matt okay cool that ends your turn next up is their turn the one that got blasted back is going  to move counting 30 its not within range to actually get anybody and it doesnt see where you  are so instead the person that it sees /none/ immediately is going to be caleb then it moves  the rest of its 30 feet to get into  taliesin will it bump into me  matt well say it knocks you a little bit out of the way but it doesnt have anything to attack  with because it used its action to get up next to you currently is in melee with both of you no i  didnt come across you it didnt quite cross your path this one over here is going to  taliesin how did it get so far whats their speed  /none/ all double dash  taliesin oh fuck okay  matt this ones stunned this one here is going to be now up against fjord its going to strike  out towards you twice fjord  marisha i thought he had his little moment with the little quick goblin  sam and matt its ignoring the goblin  sam focusing on stronger things the goblins still on its face  matt you can still do damage with it every turn and it still sees it and is considering it  actually ill make an intelligence saving throw  marisha you said /none/ you used the initiative of the one that died by accident it was coming up on  this turn its all on one round was what you said  sam i think you had it move but you didnt have it do an action yet i dont think  matt no its true youre right  marisha because i tried to do sentinel on it  matt no youre right i fucked up my own order cool  sam i dont think you did an action for it you just tried to move  matt it did no i had /none/ it waste its action to try and attack the thing yep as the two very big  attacks on nothing its starting to not worry about it the other one is stunned that ends its  turn the one on yasha is going to attack twice thats going to be a natural 20  taliesin do i have a reaction or did  matt you were using you reaction to hold your  taliesin that is my reaction is to hold my attack  matt when youre holding an action it uses your reaction to release it  taliesin okay /none/ sorry  travis shes raging i think its okay  matt the other one is a 17 to hit  travis both hit  matt all right critical is 22 bludgeoning damage to her reduced to 11 and the second one is nine  points of bludgeoning damage reduced to four shes grappled by it it has her held in both of  its claws holding her there in front and then tendrils begin to move towards her face she needs  to make a constitution saving throw please  travis okay 15 damage constitution saving throw does she have /none/ advantage on no okay  laura plus four  travis oh shes great 24 plus 26  matt shes dealt with harsher toxins than this she doesnt even duck out of the way she just  takes it and it doesnt have an effect it burns and nothing i got that one and that one yeah  thats their turn man that stun that stun and that illusion that ends their go yashas up now  travis yashas going to try and get to red lobster with two more swipes of the magicians  judge reckless for straight attacks  /none/ taliesin first one doubles  travis okay what doubles  taliesin all the damage the first one is doubled

first one does hit  travis thats good okay  matt the first strike goes through so its full damage times two  travis sweet counting 19 times two so 38  /none/ matt 38 points of damage how does yasha want to do this  all oh  laura golf claps  travis yeah sweet she will come down in an overarching right with that magicians judge and  on the second one shell shove the sword in and crack that fucking thing like a beautiful fillet  matt as she drags it down the side of its body she puts her foot up and using that she pushes  to the side and watches it tear in half you see a bunch of internal purple sinew and muscle tear  open /none/ it gives this horrible dull squeak sound before it goes limp and begins to float and slowly  sink to the bottom  travis as yasha so many people leave so much good food in here got to know how to eat lobster  matt that finishes yashas turn she has movement yes  travis shell take her 15 feet towards the other two  matt all right one two three she gets into that one there  travis can she get on his ass  matt yep  travis nice  matt all right that finishes yashas go beau /none/ and nott you guys are up  marisha okay  matt that one is still stunned because its until the end of your next turn  marisha dope im going to do a kick off the ocean floor and im going to jump i want to do an  aerial over the two of them to land towards fjord as im upside down in the air im going to take  my two attacks  matt go for it  taliesin i also like that youre bleeding so theres a perfect red corkscrew happening  marisha so dope  matt /none/ no attack of opportunity from

youre seeing its tendrils are  trying to go towards you you jam the staff right into its throat there and as it does it pulls  back unable to really get its bearings  marisha jester sees an arc of my blood through the water as im bleeding and i cartwheel  laura beautiful  matt second attack  marisha second attack im going /none/ to go to the one thats already stunned  matt these are both happening in the air as youre arcing  marisha this is just a straight roll right  matt correct  travis natural 20  matt damn the luck on this round  marisha ive been using my fists as magical wow cool real cool

youre able to read peoples thoughts after that  marisha six damage  travis youll only know if its inception or not if it falls over at some point  matt that is two impacts /none/ as you bludgeon that one whos stunned and arc on the other side its  looking hurt but its still in the fight that ends your turn  marisha yeah  matt all right beaus done nott  sam because im a rogue im going to go bolt bolt bolt and fire three times  matt okay  sam we got 25 25 and 11  matt those creatures are all stunned and theyre within your short range so you have advantage on  the attacks  sam nope 20 and then

hits against which ones  sam the one that looked real rough  matt the first /none/ strike is against him roll your sneak attack on him  sam 17 plus five 22  matt the bolt gets lodged in its throat and it just managed to shrug off the actually no that  ones not stunned anymore because it was the end of your turn oh man i got this all confused my  own fault go ahead that first one probably would have hit anyway at this distance so that damage  does take it out  sam the first time i rolled the first two hit and the last one missed want to go /none/ with those  matt right  sam so two hits  matt all right the first one wipes it out how do you want to do this  cheering  sam i would love the bolt to  matt three weeks getting rusty  sam oh boy i would love for the bolts to go fjords right in front of it right  matt correct  sam i would love the bolt to go out through its head and stop just shy of fjords face  travis crap fire  matt it slowly crumples to the bottom of the ocean /none/  travis what in tarnation  marisha sweet molasses  matt take your next strike the other one is stunned so those two other strikes would have  hit so youre fine  sam so i should roll for those  matt yeah roll damage for the other two  sam damage okay both were the same both were seven points  matt all right so 14 total got it  sam is that the one that has the phantasmal force on it  matt correct  sam yes so that one also takes an extra five points of psychic /none/ damage from a goblin on its face  travis hasted nott man  matt it takes the impact and spins around trying to look towards you and it sees you but then  youre still on its face its very confused  sam its a confusing fight  matt yeah its not having a good day  travis it just wants to live  matt that finishes your turn nott caleb youre up  liam ive been on my way over to the scrum over there trying to help and i begin to weave magic  missile again and he /none/ is about to cast it and the thing comes behind him and he goes whoa and  unleashes on the one right behind him magic missile level three yeah i need one more  counting  laura those dice are really pretty i like how theyre themed  liam 15 total  matt 15 points of damage  liam im not going to move because it will claw me in half  matt probably that ends your go caleb the impacts in the front of it parts of its chest  blacken from the blast of the magic missile but /none/ it shrugs it off this one seems relatively  comparably unharmed to the others its taken a few hits but its doing all right that finishes  your go caleb fjord youre up  travis im worried about caleb okay lets do it  marisha okay this could be awesome  travis im going to grab beaus arm and go come on first mate and cast thunder step take the  falchion and shove it into the bottom of the ocean  matt he slams the falchion into the ground theres a blast of electrical energy and this  force /none/ wave immediately sucks in and theyre missing theyre gone where are you guys going  travis were going to come to calebs aid right here does that sound good  marisha mmhmm  travis and right behind me  marisha right behind fjord  travis all right there you go  marisha yep thank you  matt you got it  travis thats 3d10 plus hex  matt does it get a dex saving throw against that to try and reduce damage  travis a constitution saving throw yes  matt that is going to be a 20  travis /none/ yeah that saves  matt so does it take damage half damage  travis it takes half  matt got it  laura what about yasha  travis thats 20 solid so just ten ten points  matt ten damage as the water explodes and then sucks in the creature is stunned and is looking  very hurt but its still snarling  travis cool its only within ten feet and i think yashas 15 feet away from where fjord was  matt correct the creature is ten spaces wide  travis awesome with my bonus action can i transfer /none/ my hex to that fuckstick  matt you can fuckstick has been hexed  travis oh sorry wait d6 for hex thats six  matt for which one oh for hex  travis yeah because i cast hex on that bastard  matt no hex was the other one that had died  travis thank you youre right never mind  matt sorry  travis no thats okay  matt thats all right that finishes fjords go jester caduceus youre up caduceus you  reappear in your space  laura oh hi caduceus  taliesin hey  laura im going /none/ to move my spiritual weapon down to try to hit the one next to yasha  travis lets go now  matt go for it  travis lets go  matt it has advantage because its stunned  laura oh sweet doesnt it balance out though because it wouldve been at disadvantage  matt its a spiritual weapon its not material so its not hindered by  laura 17  matt 17 hits  laura okay eight plus four is 12 points  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  laura im going to use the /none/ spiritual weapon and try to shove it into its mouth over and over  again saying eat it its good  matt eventually it jams itself into this creatures maw repeatedly as it backs away the  back of its shelled head begins to crack before it splinters at the back the spiritual weapon  emerges from the back of its skull and it crumples to the ground  travis yeah  laura then for my action im going to say oh hi fjord and im going to jump up and land on  its back next to me  /none/ matt over here all right  laura im going to cast inflict wounds at 2ndlevel  matt all right because of calebs position you do have flanking bonus so you have advantage on  the attack roll  laura ooh okay  travis its a spell so theres no disadvantage right  laura right its a touch so its not a melee attack  matt technically its considered a melee attack so you would have disadvantage on the strike but  it give you advantage because hes there so its just a straight roll  laura okay 24  matt /dung/ 24 hits  travis yeah its like whats up over here  laura thats how many how many do i roll 4d10 no wait 4d10  matt 4d10 ooh roll some damage  laura 14 points of crab damage  matt as you reach out after flipping over and landing behind it you grab the back of it and  you see the divine energy pulse through this dull grayishblue energy arc down your forearms hit  the shell and these sparks of dark energy break through causing these small bits of its shell to  break and flake off /none/ in areas its shocked from the impact did a pretty decent bit of hurt to it  that the end of your turn i believe it does caduceus what are you doing  taliesin im going to sacred flame this guy im going to step back a little bit 15 feet  matt its going to make an attack towards you  taliesin yeah get rid of your stuff  matt thats going to be 21 to hit  taliesin oh that hits  matt okay you take eight plus six points of damage thats 14 and you are grappled /none/ so you do  not move  taliesin okay i still get my attack though  matt you do also make a constitution saving throw to see if you can maintain bless  taliesin 14 points of damage and constitution saving throw nine  matt

dex saving throw natural one  taliesin all right thats nice take seven points of radiant damage /none/  matt you got it after it grabs and pulls you in you actually blast it from inside its claw you  release the spell from your staff and the flame burns up the outside blackening the outside of  its crustaceanlike armored shell ending your turn caduceus correct all right its now its  turn it has caduceus grappled in one claw yep yeah its going to continue its path it releases  caduceus and its going to go all in on its original quarry which is caleb its a natural 18  plus six thats 24 to hit /none/  liam no that hits sorry i was going backwards  matt 15 points of bludgeoning damage and you are grappled  liam yeah  matt second attack thats going to be 20 to hit  liam yeah  matt that is 11 points of bludgeoning damage as it slams both of its claws into you its grabbing  you from both sides of your torso and legs pulling apart as the pain hits in it grabs you in  towards its face and its tendrils lap around your head and neck area make a constitution saving  throw for /none/ me  laura it feels like frumpkin only painful  liam ten  matt as the venom pulses into your body you feel your entire torso legs arms seize with searing  pain you are paralyzed and poisoned  sam ugh what does that do  liam what if the roll had actually been shite 13 would that have changed it  matt why would you have had to change it  liam because i have the transmuters stone which is giving me proficiency on constitution saves if  im remembering correctly  matt i trust you on that 13 /none/ would resist it its a dc 13  liam proficiency in constitution saving throws thats what i have  matt so yeah and that would be enough to resist it  travis you found that fast youre turning into mercer i cant find shit in that book  matt as the poison begins to pulse into your system in the moment the pain begins to hit the  back of your skull you immediately glance towards the transmuters stone that youre clutching in  your right hand and with that you feel the energy pulse through your body and shrug /none/ off the  toxin from entering the deep parts of your system  travis put it up top widogast  liam theres a slight crooked little smile peeking out from underneath frumpkin on my head  matt perfect ending its turn yashas up  sam end it yash  travis can she peek in the doorway  matt sure  travis not that she doesnt think all of her friends cant handle it but  matt she looks inside and there skitter no im kidding  laughter  liam the queen  travis i was like no im not killing /none/ ashleys character  matt looking through the interior of the now partially jagged broken entrance to this temples  base you can see this very heavily covered seaweedinfested interior that wraps around the  inside and one central big knotted tangle of seaweed  travis cool  matt is that yashas turn  travis yes  matt top of the round beau and nott  travis thatll drop her rage too  matt yes it will its where notts been the whole time hiding right over there  marisha okay you want me to see if i can punch this /none/ guy first  sam yeah you go first youre way closer  marisha okay im going to take my

strike is prodding it with the staff you still have your  bonus action  marisha yeah i guess ill just punch it one more time  travis the club punch bitch  marisha yeah through the crowd grabbing its hair  travis walk away with some weave in your hand  marisha jesus i /none/ dont think thats going to do it either unless 14  matt 14 misses unfortunately doesnt miss you impact and reach through and  marisha yeah  matt that finishes beaus turn nott youre up  sam ill swim closer ill fire actually with one hand i will take another swig of booze if i  can under the water somehow and with the other hand ill fire  matt there you go  sam natural 20  matt all right roll your sneak attack damage  marisha fucking onehanded bandit  sam do i double it  matt yes /none/ you do  sam dice damage is doubled counting 23  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  sam lets see here its a crossbow bolt i would again like the crossbow bolt to tickle  fjords ear as it whizzes by  travis a little slice  sam yeah just a little  matt theres a brief bit of warm hot sharp pain on the outside of your earlobe  sam sorry  matt as the bolt enters the base of the creatures skull you dont see it protrude you  dont even know where /none/ it went you just see it vanish and the creature is standing there for a  second as it falls onto its back its legs all curl in like a spider and its claws close in  sam accidentally because i rolled a natural 20 i shoot again  matt thats right  sam shit sorry  matt this time you with the falchion rake it out of the air  sam sorry its the thing it does it  travis i dont know if i believe you  matt a few moments pass as you guys glance around the /none/ area to take in whether or not theres some  danger you manage to pull off the pincer from around your body  taliesin im all right i think everybody could take a few minutes  laura beau caleb you guys look bloody  marisha does this look bad  sam and taliesin ugh  liam caleb pulls up and theres claw piercing all along the ribs  laura yeah looks like shit  sam but the salt water  laura yeah its cleaning it i think we should maybe rest a little bit  liam caleb sits down in /none/ the muck  travis actually if we went inside then at least anything thats swimming overhead with big teeth  might not see us  taliesin thats true  laura as long as nothing attacks us inside  taliesin i can take ten minutes and give everyone a little bit of a boost  travis that would be great yasha do you see anything in there quietly no  laughter  sam exaggerated swedish accent no i dont  matt she looks back from the inside and goes  laura he tried to do it  travis error 404  /none/ matt the lip quiver  laughter  matt she looks back and goes theres a cluster of seaweed inside steps into the interior  doesnt enter the entire structure but steps in the middle waiting for any sort of direction from  you guys  travis deuce do you want to take a look make sure that its not the ravenous variety  taliesin ill look in the door before we sit down is this thing giving me a vibe  matt make a nature check for me if you dont mind  taliesin nature check oh no  travis /none/ ill help caleb over to the door  taliesin my nature check weirdly sucks  laura ill help beau  taliesin yeah i know its funny how my nature check is terrible 13  matt looking at the seaweed in this interior it is of the same variety as that which is clustered  around the rest of this tower it is not similar from what you can tell to what you encountered at  dashillas lair in the divers grave youre not certain if it has any interest in you guys but it  doesnt seem to be reacting /none/ to your presence  taliesin it doesnt seem to be a problem were just going to be here for a minute and then well  be on our way let me know if youve got any issue and well do our best to stay out of your business  matt make a persuasion check  sam roll for kelp  taliesin 15  laura i like that regardless of the character taliesin likes to charm plant life  taliesin i do plant life needs love man  matt life needs love to live  taliesin aw see now i feel /none/ better about the whole thank you  liam npr announcer voice this is grass talk on kcrw  matt what are the rest of you doing  marisha i would like to go in and find a little bed of seaweed and lay down for a minute  laura not the stuff in the middle maybe just lay on the silt  taliesin anybody who needs a heal im going to do the tenminute im going to start in the  interior of this the prayer of healing so anybody who needs  marisha is anybody against a short rest /none/  liam i need a short rest  taliesin can we afford a short rest  travis yeah we have 24 hours of breathing so were okay  liam yes please  marisha im pretty tapped on ki points and  taliesin i will not say no to a short rest  marisha  blood  travis yeah lets get inside  taliesin nothings looking for us  liam i am dropping and leaning against beauregard  taliesin never mind im not casting the spell  travis jester that was very impressive i must say  laura what oh you /none/ mean that little inflict wounds that i did  travis and the use of the lollipop really nice stuff  laura oh yeah that lollipops pretty freaking cool  marisha thats old business weve seen that one  matt as you guys take a short rest you can use your hit dice to heal up  travis well be inside  marisha are you doing your thing no  taliesin no if were taking a short rest thats if you dont want a short rest but you want to  roll out  marisha copy  sam while were around /none/ down here can i swim around look for any other trap doors or doors  or doors  matt sure make a perception check at first  sam perception four  matt okay then make an investigation check  sam four oh wait plus i get pluses on that 13  matt thats better looking around the interior there doesnt appear to be any trap doors or  anything thats hidden amongst the space theres the heavy clusters of seaweed that fill up along  the walls and it largely obscures when you look up you can see because its /dung/ dark inside aside  from the light thats there at the very top of the tower where the light tends to fade you see  the open circular top where the faint bit of blue light from the sky above comes through the ocean  you can see all the different slowlywaving tendrils of seaweed cluttering up a lot of that  space the center area you glance over and you can see where that big mass of seaweed and  underwater plant life is along the edge of where it is you prod it and it softly gives a /none/ little  bit past the floor  laura ooh  sam theres a door or something over here  travis yashas back up to full  laura can i have been outside looking at the clicking that we fought so i can look at him and  see whats going on  travis careful as you head out there you dont know whats above you  sam he cares about you  matt the tendrils that are from its head that you saw trailing behind it are as long as the length  of its body theres about 12 of /none/ them that drift behind it though theyre all limp now and it  just lies there destroyed its wearing an old slightly tattered robe who knows how ancient  thats as much detail as you can make off of it other than its jaws limply hanging open these  dull lifeless flaps where you can see the toothy interior of its mouth as it hangs  laura does its bustedup robe have pockets  matt make an investigation check  sam oh that was a journey  laura yeah that was what was it before i accidentally hit it  /none/ sam three  laura okay oh four hey  matt look at that change your group name to the mighty four here today  taliesin we are not paying attention to things  matt i know well youre all a little busted about that previous battle no pockets no  keepsakes it looks like its pretty plainly adorned  taliesin is there something in the middle of all that tendril in the center of this tower is it  obscuring something  laura thats what he said its actually a hole in the middle  matt you go over and /none/ look a lot of this is theres roots around the edge of it where some of  the plant has rooted itself to the stone floor of this temple but theres large portions of it that  go beyond those roots upon pushing on it it has some give below that central area it looks like  theres some sort of opening or a space below the center  taliesin oh i suppose were going to be heading down  travis i dont want to disturb the fauna is there a more genteel way to make our way through  /none/ taliesin were going to be having to head down below were going to try not to disturb your root  structure but if theres another way down that you might happen to know of we would appreciate  any clue as to what that may be no shift in the water nothing no little twitch  matt no  taliesin i apologize to the interruption of your very calm day  liam did one of you do healing and i missed it  taliesin we did a short rest so everybody thumped are you all right with where you are /none/  laura hey you know what though i bet that the seaweed is actually really happy because before it  had those crab things and claws and stuff constantly fucking with it now were really nice  and its calm and peaceful in here  taliesin i mean we dont have the best history but sure  laura with this seaweed specifically  taliesin yeah thats fair  travis jester you find anything on that guy  laura oh he had a robe on  travis no pendants or necklaces or keys  laura not that i could see it /none/ seemed like a pretty old robe that didnt have any pockets or  anything he did have really long tendrily hair which was pretty cool did you want to bring the  body inside or something so that whatever is out there wont see that we killed it  travis yeah lets do that yasha will help you pull the body back in  sam why dont you guys go out there together on a walkaround just a little you guys could go  together is all im saying  travis who yasha and her  sam no fjord fjord /none/ and jessie could go together  laura but yashas really strong  sam sure but so are you and you could show him  laura okay  travis i dont mind  sam go on have fun take your time  travis all right  sam do you need any money  laura no im okay right now thanks mom this is the body this is what i was talking about with  the tendrils with the hair and stuff  matt its pretty gross  travis is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff on it keys  matt /none/ make an investigation check  travis im real good at these  laura theres no pockets i already looked and stuff  travis thats cocked thats worse 11 no yeah 11  matt as jester said no pockets no trinkets nothing on it but the tattered robe its wearing  and its weird somewhat almost dolphinlike rubbery flesh  laura ew  travis lets pick it up maybe we can offer it as a gift to the slurping as we make our way down  laura ew creepy ill hold its hair if you want to hold its feet  /none/ travis okay are you grabbing the tendrils ugh  matt you guys drag its body back over to the tower base  travis caduceus you okay with us chunking this into the  laura wait wait  travis what  laura what if its a door or something why would we let somebody know that were coming if its a  doorway we could peek our head in down below  travis i meant we were going to toss the body into the seaweed and let it have a snack  taliesin i dont know if well i mean place /none/ it next to the seaweed see if it has any i dont  think this is carnivorous but its worth checking  laura i think its just seaweed fjord  travis oh okay i thought it was the gnarly kind  taliesin no its not that kind  travis oh okay never mind sorry i misunderstood  matt thats okay whats up whatre you guys doing youve taken a short rest  taliesin hows that door that we found in the middle of the seaweed looking  sam i could try to move some of the seaweed with mage hand /none/ or something whooshing  matt okay the seaweed itself is pretty knotted and tangled and twisted around itself as the mage  hand gives and pulls it very softly releases its hold on the other tendrils and pulls apart like  someone sweet talked a bit of it its still tangled and still a lot of it there but its not  holding taut you imagine that someone could probably climb through it  laura did you want to climb through it  sam no but i will its my job  taliesin ill go right after you too just /none/ in case something goes wrong  sam will it sting me  taliesin i dont think so i think that theyre pretty friendly  laura ill go touch it just in case  matt okay as you reach out and your hand grasps the edge of the seaweed it moves with your touch  and drifts a bit its seaweed  laura oh its nice its nice seaweed thank you seaweed  travis hello bees  sam ill go down ill push through and see how far i can get  matt okay you dive in and pull your way /dung/ through reaching up youre now in an inverse state what  is up is down as you pull yourself below and upward sifting and yanking through and finding  sections where you have to pull and find a space thankfully youre the smallest of the troupe so  its not as hard for you you begin to descend ten 20 30 feet or so and the seaweed isnt dissipating  sam its just dark  matt its just dark you have darkvision but right now all you can see is clusters of seaweed  its very poltergeist in a way /none/ as youre pulling your way through  taliesin fjord i think  matt about 40 feet down your hands reach through the small tunnel that youve been  clambering through below opens up on the sides you glance and look inside and you appear to be  in some sort of a spherical chamber roughly about 60 feet across side to side  sam and im at the top of it right  matt youre at the top of it looking down there are clusters of seaweed all around it theres  plant life thats embedded in aspects of it /none/ a bunch of the seaweed is all coming up and tangling  towards the center to create this upward column of plant matter  sam thats where the roots were and it was growing up through the tunnel or something oof i  dont see any signs of life or light or structures  matt make a perception check  sam oh im terrible with this 18  matt taking a moment very carefully eyeing the space no signs of life oh  sam what what was that  matt two little fish  travis chomping  sam screaming  /dung/ marisha theyre this big  sam they went for my jugular  travis theyre very smart  matt roll initiative against the death minnows yeah the place looks relatively empty beyond the  plant life that exists there  sam ill take out my wire and make a little phone call come in caleb hello will you let the  group know that its a 40foot climb through dark grossness and then theres a chamber down here  you can reply to this message  liam you would advise coming  sam i dont want to go back through it /none/ again so im going to stick down here if you guys want to  come just come you can reply to this message  liam she wants us to rally below it is gross on the way down but okayish  laura gross how  liam i crawl down  matt there you go  travis and laura i follow  matt everybody follows you all head down its a slimy climb since youre all a little larger than  nott especially yasha theres a bit of difficulty in pulling through at some points  yasha angrily tears bits apart /none/ and starts making her way down  taliesin sorry  matt you all eventually manage to clamber through slipping into the lower chamber all of  you get to see this large spherical chamber where the wrapping seaweed spirals upward to fill that  space the structure is semifamiliar in size and design to you fjord  travis ive seen a place like this once before when we were in the temple previously with  avantika if you will help me you could search the floors and the walls for any sort of recessed  sphere shape  laura stage /none/ whisper this whole thing is a recessed sphere shape fjord  travis i think it needs to be about yay big  taliesin im casting light  matt light fills the space you can now see  sam last time you went down into one of these we had to make a very quick exit do we have a plan  for making a very quick exit  travis well if we find we something that looks like the previous situation then maybe we could  send some of us out of here before we put the key in the /none/ lock  laura will the key in the lock release the clicking tongue  travis no as far we know i dont think it will  taliesin i can cast water walk if we have to  marisha yeah i have a weird question because you became a champion after well you became a  champion and avantika was a champion when avantika died someone else become the champion  travis i dont think so i think its to get the three spheres in the three temples she did hers  and died i have the second and the third /none/ but thats my logic i must concede i dont know how  many temples there are im only going off of that art that we saw in the temple  laura there were three in the art and there were three balls and you got the two balls  sam this is ball three  travis and marisha ball two  travis now unless theres two holes in here there should only be one in theory  taliesin im taking a long look around during this  sam ball two wait you have two in you  matt are you /none/ looking in the space make a perception check  laura hes holding two keys basically  marisha he got one ball we put in one ball we got another ball he has two balls  taliesin ten  marisha and were about to put another ball in there  matt a lot of plant a lot of plant matter a bit of stone  liam there is no guarantee there is another temple somewhere with another person with dreams  like you and avantika who has already done this this could be the final piece of the puzzle if we /none/  understand the carvings we saw correctly even we dont actually know do we  travis no  laura could you ask your god could you ask him  travis how do i do that jester  laura well do it like i do to the traveler  travis does he answer you when you talk to him  laura yeah  travis he does  liam im going to start looking around  laura hey traveler  matt make an investigation check  laura yeah he totally just said whats up  travis would you ask him if he /none/ knows anything about this  laura hey traveler have you heard anything about this weirdo ukotoa guy  sam taliesin and laura whispers ukotoa  matt whispers ukotoa  laura he has heard about as much as we have  laughter  matt what did you roll  liam 27  matt 27 investigation a few things catch your eye as youre all having this conversation caleb  dives towards the bottom and begins rummaging through the base of the seaweed to look on the  base the first thing you notice is theres a skeleton  sam a skeleton /none/  matt yes a skeleton that is wrapped in leather armor the bones of the skeleton you could see a  lot of mineral deposits have gathered around it where the skeleton looks weirdly swollen a lot of  buildup on it like youve seen those sunken ships that look lumpy you find that the leather armor  is pristine but the skeleton is fucked you also see clustered around the base there numbers of  small shiny bits of material that the light that caduceus had cast is refracting off it coins  gold platinum copper silver you look /none/ and rummage in the one side you find a glass vial  that is tangled in weeds that has a dull swirling bluegray color to it thats thick you  pull it out and its still stopped and kept you fullon terminatorscanned the base of this area  you glance over and other people are watching caleb as he starts rummaging through and finding  there is a collection down here there is a sixinchwide thick glass sphere that appears to  be empty thats resting on the ground as well  liam an empty standalone sphere  matt yeah /none/ it was rolled into and wrapped around by some of the local plant life you do see as  well a small green piece of stone carved to look like a feather almost but its made of a deep  jade or green stone and a small piece of agate stone that catches your eye mostly covered in  grime you rub off and polish it you can see the agate stone from beneath it  liam agate agate  sam is someone writing this stuff down  marisha im about to do that  liam potion sphere feathershaped stone /none/ and an agate stone  matt agate stone skeleton  liam thats four things plus the coins  travis i dont know what agate is what does agate look like  matt ill show you  laura its brownish  sam do you have it all marisha  marisha yeah the feather was  liam its a stone shaped like a feather  laura i gave you some agate dice those little ones that i gave you those were green agate  sam i dont remember  matt and plenty of coins as you are rummaging through the coins and /none/ you shift through where the  glass sphere was it rolls off the side beneath where it settles with much of the coins you can  see a lot of coins are filling the space but theres a little bit of a divot roughly about the  size of half a fist in the floor  liam does it look like this sphere that ive found is the same shape as this  matt no the sphere that you found is larger it wouldnt fit it was resting in the space it has  grime around it you rub it /none/ off a bit  travis its a seethrough glass or is the same color  matt its a seethrough glass  liam i will alert everyone that this stuff it down here i gathered up all of the things that  are not coins  laura oh look coins  matt the skeleton as well  liam no  laura what is that armor  sam were picking up coins matt  matt okay you guys start gathering and shoveling coins into your pockets and pouches and  everything both of you guys make investigation checks for me to glean /none/ how much you can find  amongst the tangled seaweed  sam 25  laura 11  inaudible murmuring  sam keep going  laura how much money did we find  matt how long are you taking are you going until you cant find any more it would take you about  15 minutes to do it its a lot of coins  sam five minutes  laura im going to keep going i mean as long as everybody is hanging around talking im going to  keep searching  matt okay you guys keep searching what are the /none/ rest of you doing  marisha caleb are you going to identify these things  liam are we going to take the time do that now  travis well i figured were in a safeish space i dont know we can do it on the ship  liam i will need some time i heard you whispering about this bauble so i will begin on it  marisha well the glass sphere makes me nervous i feel like i heard of things like this before  liam well if someone has seen us through it they already have  travis /none/ my question to you oh they could see us through the glass sphere  liam in theory i sat down on the floor oh shoot i cannot do it now because my books are in  your bag if i take them out they would be ruined  laura yeah i havent opened it dont worry  travis thats okay we can do it on the ship with that crazy investigation check of yours did  you find any recessions in the floor  liam yeah  travis just one  liam yeah  marisha can i get a closer /none/ look at the skeleton with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable  matt the armor is studded leather its well made theres a bunch of black sediment and  general slime and grime from the red plant life thats gathered around the various plates of it  that are fastened together but it rubs off relatively easily its well made  marisha no iconography no identifying symbols  matt make an investigation check for me  marisha dont fail me now okay 23  matt it looks fairly plain as you pull it up the bones snap /none/ and the skull tumbles off of the  neck and spinal cord as that happens you glance on the inside while it looks plain on the  outside on the inside of the shoulder and the back of the plate you can see faintly pressed runes  laura yeah magic armor  liam too clean to be normal  travis i dont recognize that armor do i  matt not really  taliesin im going to point out id be careful whatever this armor is it didnt seem to help  this fellow much  marisha thats a good point /none/  laura what do you think killed him  travis does he look like his appendages are all attached any cracks on the skull or face or any  sort of  matt make a medicine check  travis me  matt yeah youre the one whos asking  laura well i did say what you think killed him  travis yeah hey jester could you make a  matt ill give it to you  travis thank you  sam shes searching for coins  matt you each get to roll as you take a look at it game /none/ the system  liam caduceus can you talk to this dead person  travis natural 20  taliesin i didnt think to put that in my bag for this particular run  matt what did you roll  laura i got a 16  matt okay looking at it the lower parts of the ribcage on the inside as well as the hips and the  pelvis of the skeleton are crushed you look at some of the crushed bones and you pull it back  you can see scrapes across the bone like edges of something sharp that had /none/ crushed through it also  had some sort of an edge to it  travis maybe it got crushed by the pincers and then crawled down here where they couldnt follow  laura oh true  marisha my brain went super elaborate and thought that this chamber crushes people if you fuck it  up that makes way more sense  laura i thought that maybe somebody sat on his hips like he was having sex or something but it  was too much for him  marisha oh man reverse cowgirl death  taliesin heres the question do you /none/ do this alone or do we stay here with you were at a disadvantage  travis i think i need to do it alone if im going to risk getting out quickly i dont want  you to have to do the same theres only one recession in here so one sphere  taliesin lets maybe keep a friend with mister fjord we can keep eyes on him in the chamber  laura oh frumpkin you mean  taliesin yeah  laura maybe you can cast haste on fjord and that way he can get away quickly if he needs /none/ to  liam by the time we clear the room there would not be much time left to that spell  taliesin which i think itll be fine with just fjord and frumpkin  travis i do have my mariners armor i have my normal speed  taliesin we could be outside up in the top layer of the temple and wait for you whether or not  you need help or whether or not its time to run  travis sure i dont think theres anything else to do  background music  sam dont you need someone to /none/ stay with you in case you have to make what if you turn evil  taliesin do you want to be in the room  travis im not going to turn evil im not going to turn evil i rub my cut earlobe  sam she did it  travis now look i think were overthinking it right same as before i anticipate some crazy  arcane stuff to activate maybe a little rumble and a shake you guys have been more than  accommodating you dont need to be down here with me when it happens if something does /none/ go wrong  that should be my burden my price to pay not yours  taliesin well see through frumpkin anyway  laura what if the chamber closes and youre stuck down here fjord  travis i dont think it will and only because if ukotoa really wants me to do all of this for  him what good would trapping me down here do i have the third sphere i dont think hes going to  hamstring me like that  liam you know him pretty well  travis no i dont but i wouldnt gum up the one /none/ person that was bringing me the thing that i  needed to get out of demigod jail  liam you still mean to veer away from all this once were done here  travis yeah id like to i dont know what that looks like i dont even know how thatll go but  i dont want to release a seasnake beast on the world  laura well thats good  travis yeah  liam im going to expend a use of expeditious retreat on myself which will a make me a little  bit quicker i would change the /dung/ nature of the transmuters stone to let me see in the dark and  i send frumpkin to glomp onto fjords arm and shoulder  sam better hand him that hat  taliesin well be waiting for you upstairs  travis yeah fair enough  taliesin if anything starts to go wrong well try to get to you if youre encumbered well try  to clear a path and once youre up with us ill bring everybody to the surface  travis if you hear the signal take off you remember the signal right  taliesin no  travis choked /none/ screaming  taliesin i feel like that signal happens a lot though  laura thats a common signal  taliesin we hear it a lot  laura im going to sit down really fast and say hey traveler i know that hes doing something  for this other god guy but we both know this other god is pretty stupid so if you do me a  favor and watch after fjord that would be really great because hes done a lot of things that has  really helped out with stuff for you and hes going to be pretty /none/ helpful in helping me get to  you later this year anyway i really like you and i really like him and i would like if you would  help out please thank you  travis can i go and sit down right in front of jester  matt yeah  laura can i help you  travis well whatd he say  laura did you hear what i was saying  travis kind of you had a little projection on it yeah  laura oh shit i thought i was whispering hold on let me think im listening  /none/ travis jester  laura what  travis you dont have to tell me its fine i appreciate the sentiment its okay you can go  laura i really hope he does help you  travis me too  laura be safe fjord whispering and also dont turn evil okay but if you do ill still  be your friend i mean its okay you know some people are evil its okay just dont turn evil  to me  travis or anyone else just you  laura really any of us would be nice but  travis deal  laura /none/ okay  background music  travis all right get going  marisha while all that was happening i was picking up some platinum and gold that i found  laura thats if theres any left  sam and laura what what  marisha combing the silt and ive got the armor  matt oh youve grabbed the leather armor okay you guys all make your way up and begin to clamber through  taliesin i go last and on the way out i tap fjord on the shoulder good luck and im looking  forward to seeing you upstairs i /none/ cast protection from good and evil protection from evil  travis i dont know what that does  taliesin you know what that does though  matt i do  marisha good luck captain  taliesin just in case  matt all right as you all ascend and vanish from sight leaving fjord and frumpkin behind you look  down upon the base of this interior chamber the same recess that you had met before at urukayxl  beneath the temple of the yuanti you can see now that youre surveying it by yourself standing  over it the hints /none/ of the same spiral grooves that all emerge from it in the similar pattern as the  one you previously saw carving up the walls and meeting the upper area with the faint bits of  runes occasionally visible along the same form of prisonenchantment placed on this chamber as the  one youve already seen  travis i will kneel down in front of the recession and i will look at the eye thats in the  pommel of the falchion different voice lets see what this does and ill place it in the recession  matt okay as /dung/ you place the sword pommel down into the center of that recess the eye glows  glows your vision goes dark and dark to black flash of bright yellow light your eyes wince  though you force them open looking ahead of you you can see a bright yellow eye the size of your  body staring towards you emitting this painful glow the singular dark slit from top to bottom  focusing and twitching in your direction before it finds you watching you hear a deafening crack  and though your eyes are still adjusting to the light before /none/ you and focusing intently on this  eye on the peripheral around it you can just barely make out shifting shadows like tendrils or  movement something serpentine beginning to shift it seems to be resisting some sort of binds  cracking making gains on them adapt a loosened tendril curls behind you you dont  change your focus looking at the eye you feel like an icy blanket this scalylike tail almost  as large as your body begin to wrap around you the touch is freezing ice cold and you feel your  back arch it begins to /none/ envelop and squeeze you reward the cold sensation overwhelms your  senses your entire body goes numb and your vision begins to blur once more the light of the eye  begins to fade as the cold sensation and the grasp of this tendril becomes the entirety of your  awareness you hear a distant sound of muffled cracking again as the blackness claims your  vision you see a distant shape a broken shore at midnight before you waves curl against this  shore this long protracted beach with just a faint bit of starlight in the night giving /none/ you  just the basic outline of it along that beach you see three points of light different from  what your previous vision was theyre not bright singular points but three focused gathering of  dull lights you glance over theyre cities cities at night three of them along the shore  beyond that a faint bit of yellow grabs your attention beyond these three coastal cities you  see a forest jungle you cant make out the details from this strange elevated vantage point  you feel like youre flying above the sky the light grows brighter and /none/ its the same tint as  the eye that summoned you here as the spheres that youve claimed through your journey above  that forest you see looming the peak of a mountain range as that light grows brighter and  brighter in the heart of this jungle you hear once more release the light gets brighter  until it begins to hurt your eyes youre trying to focus on it trying to will yourself towards  it and it gets too much and you force your eyes shut the minute you open them youre back in the  chamber /none/ your body is pins and needles as the numbness begins to fade you glance down the  yellow sphere that was at the base of your sword the eye is just the dull lifeless metal that was  there when you first found the falchion all the runes suddenly begin to glow with that same  yellow faint light the spirals all around you the stone shifts again and cracks and you see  bits of stone and leftover sediment begin to release within the inside of the chamber  travis time to go ill head towards the tunnel  /none/ matt okay the rest of you up top all of a sudden you feel this seismic activity around the  base of this  laura he did it  taliesin why dont we all get outside and be here right now  liam hes on his way we should already start moving  matt cracking a second one you can see now previously these very difficulttofind runes  that were filled in with bits of dust and sand and muck that had gathered begin to burst up and  reveal the same yellow runes that you had seen previously in /none/ the temple light up the chamber  around where the hydra battle took place  marisha i look at the runes in the armor that im holding  matt no apparent connection from what you can tell however as the second impact hits the  tower crumbling  laura we need to get out  sam are we in there  matt yeah  laura go go go  matt okay you guys all begin to leave what order whos going first  liam im swimming quickly ahead of everyone because im expeditious retreat  marisha ill wait  matt /none/ okay youre next  laura ill push nott in front of me  sam i dont need pushing  matt doesnt matter youre being pushed through  sam okay ah  matt jester and beau i need you both to make dexterity saving throws and you as well fjord  as you make it going through the top  taliesin whats your plus dex  laura its a natural one so it doesnt matter  marisha 21  sam what are we rolling for  laura and taliesin no youre not  marisha just the three of us yeah  /none/ matt 15 points of bludgeoning damage as bits of the stone knock you around you take half of that  so you only take seven whatd you roll fjord  travis i rolled a seven  matt you rolled a seven so you take the 15 points as well as you manage to move through the  space and just as fjord you emerge and the rest of you begin to make your way outside of the  temple you hear this low rumble you watch as some of the rubble that was tumbling inside  suddenly begin to push /none/ upward the current of water around you begins to change in an odd way  like theres a sudden suction you werent expecting and all of you begin to be drawn  towards the temple once more all the seaweed begins to tear loose and be thrust upward there  is a geyser bursting from the chamber below where you once were and its causing this vacuum thats  pulling you up with it all of you make strength saving throws please to try and grab something  in the vicinity  laura oh gosh can i cast control water /none/  matt you can if youd like to  laura is everybody around us  taliesin i think were pretty tightknit  matt a lot of you may be yes  liam ive shot ahead a little bit if its under ten minutes since ive cast  laura yeah but we were just going through the door so were getting sucked back towards the  matt yeah you guys are being pulled back towards the temple  laura im going to cast control water and try to change the direction of the water around all of us  so that /none/ we can push away from the geyser and get farther away from it  matt okay ill allow that dont even have to make saving throws as you all begin to be pulled  into it this vacuum as the geyser is tearing up you watch as the temple that was collapsing is now  being pulled up and bits of the stone are being thrust up into the sky above it into the top of  the ocean all of you feel the immense drag and then it laxes again and you turn around and see  jester sitting /none/ there arms out forcing the will of the ocean around to hold tight and still around you  laura swim away  taliesin are we all going up lets go up im casting water walk on everybody including you  matt all of you begin to rise up at a rocketing speed towards the surface of the ocean as the  water passes by you manage to all emerge from the top the speed that youre at now that you know  its coming you manage to do your best to slow your descent and land carefully i wont make /none/ you  roll for any damage as you all land you hear this whooshing sound as you glance over in the  direction off the side of where that temple top would have been there is a geyser shooting a  hundred feet in the air bits of rock are being thrown like volcanic bombs in different  directions and then quieter whooshing it loses its force and power eventually coming to rest  and the ocean is no longer spraying into the air  taliesin lets head to the ship  travis where is the ship  matt the /none/ ships maybe a few hundred feet from where you were  taliesin lets walk that way  travis jester i didnt know you could mess with water like that  laura yeah fjord havent you seen me control water before  travis no  sam yeah they both made the ship go a little faster  travis oh im forgetful  sam but not like that underwater  taliesin that was very nice  matt you guys jog your way towards the ship you see somebody off the side notice you and start  shouting to the rest of the /none/ crew at which point the sails are unfurled a bit and as you guys make  your way towards the edge they throw the rope ladders and you all begin to climb your way back  onto the balleaters deck  taliesin we really got to do something about that at some point  laura nott  sam what what what  laura were not in the water anymore  sam oh thank god the water sucks so bad  marisha so  travis i mean it worked  laura did you get any special stuff  sam yeah do /none/ something  marisha how do you feel  travis would i know if i got something new  matt you sense that lingering pinsandneedles hasnt quite faded entirely theres a buzzing  energy about you  travis do i know what it is  matt its something connected to the ocean something connected to water  travis i mean i can try ill reach my hand out towards the sea and lift up my hand  matt borrowing from the imagery that youve seen with avantikas attempts at shaping and  manipulating the waters that surround her  travis cleaning /none/ herself on her balcony  matt correct as you will the water to follow and you guys watch this as well it extends in a  tendril and wraps up to the edge of the ship and seems to be awaiting a command  laura whoa you can do it  travis yeah i think were good  matt orly at this point has rushed up and is like captain where we going  travis make for the coast orly weve had enough time at sea  sam fuck yes  matt all right and begins shouting out commands and /dung/ you hear a voice shouting out from  the crows nest marius lepual captain ship sighted and you see him pointing off to the  side you guys glance towards the southern archipelago island and at the edge of one of the  cliff sides where there is a waterfall and a bit of the forest gathered there the front of a boat  is emerging from what is a previouslyunseen seaside cave  laura oh no  matt and thats where were going to take our break  groaning  liam can i ask a question  matt yes /none/ you may  liam watching through frumpkins eyes as he did everything down below other than hearing fjord  talk without his twang did i see the tendril that appeared or was that all in his mind  matt all you saw was him place the sword in the spot there was a flash of light from where it  was and he was immediately there was no time passage  liam so just heard him speak and heard him wedge a sword in the ground  matt correct well be right back here to see what happens here for /none/ the next bit  sam wow that was amazing matt  travis really cool shit  matt oh man were just getting

durian candy  matt oh no  laura no  marisha like durian fruit  sam durian fruit candies guys  matt does it smell like durian  sam yeah it smells and is made out of durian  travis what the hell is durian  taliesin dont open it  laura try it do it travis  matt you ever see those super spiked asian fruit  travis yeah  marisha they smell like rotten flesh when you open them  liam no dont open that  laura you /none/ going to do it  sam no its got a wrapping on it you have to take the wrapping off  travis mouth full what is that  sam its a wrap  laura well remember what  travis garbled noise  laughter  liam you were only warned six times before you put it in your mouth  marisha do you like durian  sam its good  travis ugh  taliesin its an acquired taste  sam mmm  matt all righty as you all get onto the ship and orly begins to make the course you hear /dung/ marius  lepual shouting from the crows nest that there is a ship emerging you turn it and look towards the  southern island of the archipelago and see emerging from a seaside cave that you had not  noticed upon entry the front of a ship the bow piercing the edge and making its way towards you  laura whats it look like  travis on a course to intercept starboard port  matt you dont know you can wait and find out what are you doing  liam looks like someone who waited for us to do the /none/ hard work  travis no were dropping all the sails were getting the fuck out of here and im going to use  control water to push the back of our boat out the fucking archipelago  matt okay all right the sails begin to drop begin to pick up the wind and make your way which  direction east north  travis north northeast the way i imagine thats the closest one if theres a closer  opening yeah  matt northeast would be the way  travis yeah  matt all right making that route youre giving the /none/ direction the sails pick up and the ship  begins moving as the ship turns around the corner and youre glancing as it makes its way in your  direction no colors flying similar size if a little bit smaller than your ship  marisha as a first mate  matt correct  marisha do i get a dope first mate kit like a spyglass  matt there is a spyglass on board as part of the equipment  marisha can i use the spyglass  matt you may make a perception check with advantage  sam do you open /none/ it like that or do you do one of these flick and then use it  marisha oh i absolutely whoosh and then  liam into the ocean  marisha yes argh just straight perception  matt mmhmm  marisha okay okay okay wait what  liam he said at advantage  matt yeah with the spyglass  liam oh my god its cocked you dont get to keep it but it was like 20 fuck you at an angle  marisha this literally happens to me so much thats better 21  matt okay as you glance off to /dung/ the side you can see the ship there appears to be a crew waiting  on deck scattered amongst the edges of it looking over maybe six people you can see  theyre all dressed in drab dark grays and blacks and greens sails fully open at this point and  you do notice that there are gunports on it four gunports on the side that you can see that are  being opened currently  laura oh no  marisha and you said they werent flying colors  matt correct no flags  marisha okay i turn around to /none/ fjord relay that message say theyve got gunports theyre about  to fire  sam captain captain should i go under and ready the cannons captain  travis make ready the cannons  sam ayeaye captain screaming  taliesin do you want me to give them fair warning  travis yeah whats the distance from the ship if we had to guess it  matt at this point from what you can gather as youre turning around and heading in that  direction because you were towards that southern island for the place in between the three of them  /none/ where you found its maybe about at this point 2000 or so feet away from you  travis okay  taliesin i would say close enough  matt you are taking down some of the crew to begin manning the guns  sam yes  travis i have no idea whats an appropriate range  matt all right you have the special officer action on the lower left area  sam special officer action  matt theres also one here for the captain and the first mate  marisha im so happy  matt with the statistics for your ship /none/ as we are currently  travis we couldnt just get to land goddamn it clears throat just kidding  marisha its a ship fight im getting emotional  travis taliesin do you have any idea what the range on a cannon is  taliesin far  travis 120 or 480  matt the cannons you have here are 120 short range 480foot long range  travis okay we have seven cannons  liam and they are more than four times further away than that  taliesin and i still have a control water so once theyre within 300 feet i /none/ can make their  life very unpleasant  marisha i thought was she the boatswain  sam youre the boatswain  laura im the boatswain  marisha i dont know who did the ropes and the sails  laura oh yeah  marisha wait i have this written down  liam im the boatswain  taliesin im the boatswain  laura now a boatswain  taliesin were all the boatswain  marisha no youre a carpenter the boatswain was caduceus  taliesin yeah what do you need  sam no you have access to these actions as well  marisha /none/ at least it was  matt the top two the only person that gets the bottom action is you because youre the master gunner  laura oh  marisha oh because youre the master gunner i see  taliesin so i can deal with the top two  matt are you guys fleeing or are you engaging  liam what are we doing captain  travis i am reading this card  marisha hang on were digesting  sam and travis muttered reading  sam cannon attacks deal an additional 1d10 bludgeoning damage if the attack roll is one or /none/  two the cannon misfires and cannot be fired again its an extra action other than just  regular loading  matt your crew takes care of the loading for you but you as the master gunner every round can  give that benefit to one of the cannons that are being fired  sam got it  marisha so we can do two of these right thats what you just said and the master gunner  laura its like a minigame  marisha its legit a minigame its pillars of eternity you guys  matt its hilarious how that /none/ game came out this year and this has been our adventure  sam good synergy  matt its helped me learn a lot  travis each of us get two what  marisha so the captain the first mate and the boatswain each have access to two special action  options described below  sam options  marisha options full speed ahead and fire at will and then the master gunner has access to the  pack the good powder special action  travis right which is a singular cannon shot with additional loads of powder  sam how many /none/ cannons do we have  travis seven  matt you have seven there were eight but one of them got damaged  sam how many on the side thats facing our interlopers  matt it should tell you you have  travis four on the port three on the starboard but we dont know which side theyre on  sam huh  matt right now because youre perpendicular to them youre going to have to turn to make that  motion which is how theyre able to start gaining on you you do have some lead time  travis are /none/ we both facing the same direction right now  matt right now no youre facing where the ship was when you got on in a southeast way so youre  going to have to turn to make your way that way but you can you still have a little bit of gain  on them  travis so are they on the starboard right now  matt right now they are on the starboard side yes starboard bow  travis yeah sighs  marisha can we do each of these actions on our turns or one of these actions a /none/ round  matt each of you can do one of these on your turn for the round once we engage in any sort of  shiptoship combat but right now you guys are too far away you choose now you can either  choose to engage or you can choose to try and outrun them  travis run or fight say it now what do you want to do  marisha you said run i think runs a good idea  travis yeah i did but youve already risked a lot for me  marisha i think they wouldnt be /none/ here if we didnt have something that they want  sam captain the cannons are armed and ready give me the order  travis well see how fast they are well turn to flee into the water  matt all right so are you giving the full speed ahead action essentially  travis yes  matt okay the sails unfurl the ship begins to turn making its way towards port side arcing  northeast to try and pick up the wind and begin to gain slow speed the other ship has turned and is  making its way in your /none/ path and is gaining speed rapidly it was prepared for your arrival and it  took you guys a minute to get everyone engaged to go ahead and start shoving off its closed the  distance to about a thousand feet over the time it takes you to start get everything ready to go  and head in that direction like i said it is smaller probably faster and its crew are looking  to try and catch up and engage  travis probably faster  matt well find out lets go ahead and roll initiative guys  sam for /none/ all of us or just for our boat  matt for all of you and the boat has its own initiative  laura woah  liam for everybody with a thing to do because i dont think i have a thing to do so i could just  hang out  matt yeah you could just hang out if you want  liam im going to start identifying spells im rifling through jesters  laura you have magic you could be flinging magic at them  sam you could throw fireballs and shit  liam if they get in range /none/  laura okay  sam never mind  matt thats true  marisha do you want to roll initiative then  matt oh the ship did well with a 15  liam in sixsecond rounds i dont think were in traditional  matt you guys however not so great thats a six for you guys  taliesin i still have some good spells  matt all right 25 to 20 guys  sam 20  taliesin oh thats nice  matt 20 to 15  taliesin 17  liam 15  matt all righty 15 to ten  marisha 14 /none/  travis 14  laura 12 i tried to eat one  liam what are you eating  laura the jackfruit candy  sam its not jackfruit  laura what is it  marisha and sam durian  laura durian its a durian candy  matt all righty  taliesin we usually get durian pastries after blizzcon  matt and then whos left its yasha but yeah she  travis oh she got a three no five  matt all right anyway  sam did we roll for the ship  matt i did  travis 15  matt no /none/ their ship is 15 you guys got a six  travis what the ship had a 15  matt their ship had a 15 all right anyway the ships are moving theyre too far away for you  to fire in giving the orders to move you guys are managing to stay pretty neck and neck as far  as travel for the moment  liam to maintain distance  matt maintaining a fair distance as you head northeast just passing beyond the island to the  east side of you pushing outside of the archipelago the wind begins to /none/ die a little bit  and your speed slows so does theirs it seems but it doesnt their sails maintain up  sam their sails do  matt their sails do  laura they got magic  liam how long is your water  laura its gone my control water was just to get us out  travis mines not its up for ten minutes and its at the back of the boat  matt its been more than ten minutes since you guys shoved off though  travis oh well there you go  liam so if we maintained /none/ speed with that and theyre a fast boat  laura so we need to  sam engage  travis yep  taliesin can we put them between us and land so that maybe if we can ground them  travis i have no idea i dont have any visual of where we are in relation to anything  taliesin how clear is the  matt ill show you  taliesin youll show us gasp  matt well say for the purposes of distance im putting this down because its more interesting to  look at than just a table but /dung/ well say  taliesin i like that its got little rivets  laura i like it  sam you want more  taliesin you can have mine i only do this to myself once a year  matt well say this is them well say this is you guys about a thousand to 900 feet away let me  see what can i use here for landmasses sure thatll work well say as youre coming around  here this is the island you guys are heading this is north this is east and youre coming  through this space here /none/ well use this here as the other island as youre moving past well say  taliesin captain lets hug the coast to our right a little hard maybe i can once they get  close enough shove them  travis the coast off to starboard  taliesin yeah i can shove them into the rocks maybe  marisha you want to do a hard 45degree turn if we do that if we turn starboard side we can try  and hit them with our starboard cannons  taliesin get around that little piece of  travis no were still out /none/ of range  laura weve only got three cannons on the starboard side though if we turn to port side  travis were still out of range by 300 400 yards  taliesin i cant do anything until theyre 300 feet away anyway  travis sure yeah lets aim to hug the coast on the starboard side  matt okay as you guys maneuver and tend to hang in close making your way in towards the island  they do gain a little bit of distance i need you to make a survival check as you are currently  leading /none/ the ship to try and avoid any sort of heavy rocks and things along the side of the island  travis that is a three  taliesin because i would be doing this as well can i give advantage to that or can i roll as  well on that no he has to roll on that  matt hes the captain unfortunately yeah  travis negative two to survival checks yall  matt ooh that puts you at a thats a three total  travis no five yes so three  matt yeah so three okay heading towards the /none/ side there pushing a little close in to the  island immediately you hear collision not enough to damage the hull to a serious point but  it does suffer two points of slashing damage well say across the hull  travis is our hull at full strength  matt it is  travis okay i got that  matt moving forward it manages to dislodge from the rock suffering another six points of slashing  damage you manage to pull off the rock noticing this jutting the other ship rolls better and  manages to avoid  taliesin are /none/ they close enough now  matt no they are still gaining though theyre about 600 feet away  travis how close do you need them  taliesin 300  matt are you guys continuing straight  travis uhhuh were hugging the coast were going to continue in that same line we need 480 anyway  matt all this shifts over this way as you guys continue to hug the side they gain to about 400  feet 300 feet  taliesin now  matt what do you do  taliesin i am going to cast control water and im going /none/ to shove all the water im going to  push them right into the island  travis with a tidal wave  taliesin i cant quite tidal wave i can do redirect flow or i can do whirlpool i think are  my two  liam well it creates a wave for sure  travis yeah its a wave  taliesin its a wave  liam thats what i was worried with avantika about  marisha if i remember you could do a few different things you could whirlpool  laura a 20foot tall wave that travels from one side /none/  liam its a 25 percent chance of capsizing  taliesin im throwing them on the island  sam while hes doing that captain should we turn to engage or no  travis no  matt so control water youre too far away from the beach to push them onto the beach itself you  have 300 feet from them but theyre still about 200 or 300 feet out from any sort of sandbank that  would impact them there are rocks in the vicinity so ill consider that a little bit of a  benefit to the chance of /none/ capsizing  taliesin thank you  matt youre attempting to capsize the ship 25 percent chance ill make that a 30 percent  chance roll a percentage die for me if you dont mind as you guys watch as caduceus concentrates  laura we roll a 30 or lower its good  matt the first one  taliesin percentile  matt yes so roll what yeah  taliesin i got them so the yep  liam three zero roll the dice  taliesin 15  matt you watch as the ocean rumbling swells up and slams into the ship the /none/ ship collision and  rumbling capsizes and scrapes onto the edge of a bank of heavy rocks  taliesin its just water im going to sit down that was really tiring  travis im glad we went through all that so i could get that spell once a day  laura holy moly that was some serious stuff man  sam captain captain theyre vulnerable turn so we can finish them off  travis make it so  sam gleeful quiet cheering yes yes  travis turn to port prepare to fire smoke these motherfuckers  sam pack the good /none/ powder  laughter  taliesin we can also see what they have on board  travis yeah after we splinter the ship  matt im going to get rid of that initiative order thats not going to do anything now  taliesin im so sorry  matt set aside all these great  sam theyve got magic they could unflip their ship we dont know  travis they obviously had some sort of wind in their sails  matt yeah you gather as you begin to turn the ship around and watch their ship they do not have  anything /none/ to right it from being capsized against a bunch of jagged rocks  travis i mean theyve got some arcane people theyll be fine if the can survive this barrage  marisha fire  sam you have the order men fire  matt yeah for the purposes of brevity  taliesin oh i am so sorry  matt no dont apologize thats what this shits for that was a 30 percent chance for an immediate  win and you did it  travis yeah there was a 70 percent chance it was going to fucking fail and we were going /none/ to turn  to port and get into it  matt as you turn around and prepare the cannons you see the top half of the sideways ship begin to  sift over to where the actual base of the hull and the cargo hold is now visible at the top bits of  the masts have snapped and are now floating with the sails in the ocean you can see a few people  that are starting to scramble out from underneath as you let loose a volley of cannon fire on it  you can roll those attacks /none/ if youd like to  sam sure three attacks which way did we turn doesnt matter  matt three attacks but the first one has additional damage  sam okay seven seven 14 theres plus six to hit so 13 13 20  matt is it all to the hull thats most of what you can see right now was it 13 13 20 you said  sam 13 13 20  matt the first two whooshing splashing the third one slams into the hull roll damage  travis were realizing the amount of hours that must have gone into /none/ the detail of this  matt thankfully most of this was available as an unearthed arcana in dd and i did my own tweaks  about an hour wasted  travis because im reading into targeting the helm or the sails or the cannons  sam 30 points of damage  matt 30 points of damage you splinter into the hull which has already taken a shitton of  damage yeah the ships fucked sorry mike mearls we tried to play with it a little more  laughter  sam i want to do this fight maybe the cannon blast /none/ flipped it back over again and theyve got  a second wind  matt nah  laughter  sam i want to kill things with my cannons  taliesin youre not shooting that great anyway i think probably this was for the best  matt you can see shards of wood all scattered in the area around it and the boat is sinking  between the impact of being capsized by the wave the blast of the cannon fire and the fact that  youre so close to the edge of the island put it in a position where it /none/ cant right itself  liam what do we see in the way of survivors swimming about  matt make a perception check  sam should we go rescue them get their shit  laura are you guys okay  liam theyre very far away eight  laura shouting are you guys okay  matt there are seven swimming survivors  sam the cannons are loaded again  liam do we want to grab one or two of these people so we know what was going on in the first place  sam or all of them  marisha they might /none/ just be pirates  taliesin not anymore theyre not  sam what if its the same thieves who robbed us twice  laughter  travis they tried their hand at a new occupation  liam we got a boat now baby this is going down  travis oh im so glad nervously no it cant be  marisha were thousands of miles away from fucking wildemount  travis we even did another job  laura i throw a rope out to one of the survivors  matt well let me put my papers away  sam and laura aw matt /none/  matt dont apologize that was awesome thats how you do it  travis nice call taliesin nice call  sam taliesin way to break the game  taliesin yep im here to fuck your shit up i will make sure you will never get to shoot a cannon  liam that boat is as dead as a nothic  laughter  travis do you want to go close and toss out a rope for a couple  laura do you guys have magic are you going to attack us  matt as youre shouting over the edge the ones /none/ that you can see theyre mostly raggedylooking  human neerdowells they look like theyve probably been at sea for a while skin tanned and  burned in places there is one tabaxi among them that is the only one thats actually responding to  anything youre saying she goes bring us aboard show mercy shes swimming and trying  the water is thrashing her around  laura do any of you want a tattoo  taliesin oh no  matt do you bring up all seven survivors  laura yeah i mean its up to our captain  travis how /none/ many manacles do we have  matt i dont know how many do you have  travis i dont fucking know how many manacles do we have master gunner  liam 23  sam manacles im not on manacle duty fire  laughter  matt are you firing the cannons  sam no  laura well keep them tied up  marisha captain i would like to point out the more people we have to bring on board the more  people we have to feed or if we dont have enough food  taliesin and laura we have enough /none/ food  marisha we have enough food all right  taliesin that i can help with we should maybe  laura caleb will you make sure that none of them are magic users as they come up on board okay  liam i can kind of do that you have to get them in a circle and keep them at bay for a moment  taliesin who can tie  travis well be okay i forget do we have any firearms or did the plank king dock crews clear  all that out  matt everything that was on the /none/ ship aside from the cannons  sam we got one  matt yeah you got one  laura its okay well aim our fingers at them instead get up here  travis its not like theyve got im sure theyre not swimming well well see lets get  them up  matt one by one you pull the waterlogged wayfarers that were on the opposite ship they all  get back onto the dock and look particularly frustrated angry they seem to be sizing each of  you up with their eyes as they all take a place a begrudgingly /none/ subservient position until  eventually the tabaxi gets up climbs and shakes this widebrimmed black velvet hat that looks  stained and fucked up from the sea water there was a large feather plume on it that looks like  its snapped in the middle and hanging shes like ugh well done you cheated the hell out of  that but what do you want of us  laura why did you attack us  matt well because you wandered into the middle of the archipelago and seemed to be easy pickings  what else  laura oh that wasnt /none/ very smart intensely dont you know how badass the balleater is  matt the tabaxi which wears a very calico fur coloring head turns to the side and goes the what  laura the balleater its the name of our ship the balleater we eat balls  matt one of the other pirates goes up and puts a hand on the shoulder and goes its okay  captain we got taken out by the balleater  laughter  travis fortunately you found us on a day of mercy you have a second chance at life is there  anywhere you /none/ would like to go  matt the tabaxis eyes narrow are you the captain of this vessel  travis i am  matt and your name is  travis captain tusktooth  marisha sticking with it  travis til the end  matt i am captain serack feng  laura oh hey man its like both of you are teeth people  travis thats a better name better name  matt feng  laura oh well all right  matt well you have managed to sink the  liam the cock gobbler  matt the salty criss  sam salty /none/ criss  laura did you have any treasure on there or anything  matt the captain looks back over and it is gone its beneath the waves well not anymore but we  have our lives and a third of our crew  sam im sorry what was that last part  matt a third of our crew  marisha sorry  sam you lost 14 crew  matt theyre not here are they  laura well they tried to attack us bad things happen when you get  liam yes they attacked a ship after a gigantic geyser of /none/ water spewed forth from the ocean id  say they stuck their dick in it yeah  matt it caught our attention  travis we planned to make our way for the menagerie coast do you have any objections with that  matt they all wince at the idea could you maybe leave us on the island  sam are you wanted in a city there  marisha theyre pirates  matt what do you think small one  sam sidebar clicks tongue  travis excuse us a moment yes master gunner  sam captain were not welcome in one /none/ of these towns maybe we could make some sort of a trade  give them some pirates that theyve been looking for in exchange for immunity or at least  clemency leniency  marisha i have a feeling darktow would side with these people  sam not darktow  travis you mean nicodranas yeah but were betting on the fact that they do i think if we  go into nicodranas we need to be as stealthy as possible theres a chance they might not take it  we should probably drop them off at the island give them some /none/ food  taliesin we can do that it would take a day though i cant really do anything until the morning  laura we could give them really nice tattoos  travis well go into nicodranas stealthily  liam we could try to turn them in and they could take them and us at the same time  travis thats my fear i like the way youre thinking  taliesin it could also give you a second to go and take a look at the wreck of that ship maybe  i mean you can swim  travis i can /none/  taliesin you not feeling it  travis i dont know if i want to risk it orly make for the shore of the nearest archipelago coast  matt aye aye captain the ship begins to make its way towards the edge since youre not in the  middle of a rush here you take some time to find what looks like the way to get close to the beach  are you lending them a rowboat or tossing them into the ocean  travis yeah just going in no rowboat  matt splashing  laura aw but one of /none/ them i wanted to give a tattoo to come on  travis how about one stays on deck and hes going to carry the canvas sack with some food rations  taliesin yeah weve got some stuff  travis in order to eat youve got to get the mark  laura its totally optional  travis its not optional  laura if they want to eat  matt the tabaxi turns towards the four men who havent jumped overboard yet hey levar youre  up and then jumps off hes like oh  laura dont worry levar were all friends /none/ here do you like tattoos  matt theres a fair canvas of varying levels of faded tattoos that mark shoulders and forearms  theyre all really wellmade  laura this is really nice  matt thank you  laura ive been working really hard on my skills where would you like yours  matt you can see the soaked ratty gray shirt he pulls it up and the entire body is tattooed  from wrist  travis how about his face  laura no no  travis what you dont want a unicorn pooping on his face  laura no /none/ captain i have specific tattoos that ive been working on  travis oh my fault jester  laura i want everyone who comes in contact with the balleater and captain tusktooth to walk away  with his symbol  sam whats his symbol  laura its a smiley face with a couple tusks and some googly eyes above it  laughter  travis oh jesus well hes covered in most places so pick your spot  laura where would you like it think about this think about how cool this will be think about in  20 years when captain /none/ tusktooth is the most dangerous guy youve ever heard of and theres  stories about him you will be able to say i crossed paths with the crew of captain tusktooth  and i lived  matt put it right there  laura oh so you can show people and be like hey check me out  matt sure fine do it just get it over with  laura you know that hands are really hard because a lot of time the ink it spreads okay im  going to do it  matt roll a dexterity check  sam /none/ and taliesin oh boy  laura oh oh a dexterity check 18  matt you produce a fairly successful clean tattoo of your intended design  marisha youve gotten good at those  laura yeah yeah yeah  travis give them the food beau will you show him the door  marisha right this way good levar  matt grunts  marisha work it work it work the gangplank  laughter  matt he jumps off the side of it splashing at this point now its starting to get closer to  dusk they all swim to the shore theyve /none/ begun assembling whatever scraps they can from the  nearby tree line to start building a small camp for the night what do you guys want to do  travis i actually dont need to dive down there i cant breathe water again for another until we  have a long rest  liam may i have my books back please before you draw googly eyes in the pages did you already  draw googly eyes in the pages  laura jokingly i dont know maybe heres another one for you there may be some surprises  maybe not  /none/ travis orly can we set a course for nicodranas by way of brokenbank  matt aye aye captain if i might ask what business are we looking for in brokenbank  travis oh just going by the normal trade routes just in case we i dont know run across any trouble  matt no stopping  laura why  travis how are we on supplies food water anyone sick hurt  marisha would i know that as first mate  matt if anyones sick  marisha no for supplies  matt there seem to be decent supplies you stocked up /none/ at bisaft isle and you have magical  means of creating food if you need it  taliesin food and water never stops if you need it too  laura brokenbank  matt are you asking orly you know brokenbank its the first  travis its the next stop on an established shipping lane  matt for many of the shipping lanes its the first port of entry to give your paperwork to  show what youre bringing in to make sure its all approved and going through its part of the  process of things making their way into /none/ port  travis if were set i think maybe a speed route would be great nicodranas  matt fair enough he goes ahead and starts making his way that direction from the archipelago to  nicodranas without stops looks to be between five and six days travel  travis nice ill throw in some control waters once every day  matt thatll bring you down to about four and a half well say yeah between all of you guys  being able to juggle that around okay  travis caleb  laura can i send a message to my momma /none/  matt you may  laura hey momma we are heading back to nicodranas is it safe do you think for us to  get there because i know that stuff is happening and i havent heard from you in a while probably  because i havent sent a message to  travis thats it  matt my jester youre coming back well i dont know specifically but there does not appear  to be a manhunt just be careful  laura my momma says everythings okay we just got to be careful  travis i think thats the plan /none/ caleb you want to take time to identify your goodies  liam i certainly do  marisha i hand caleb the leather armor as well  liam thank you beauregard  marisha mmhmm  liam i will go back to nott and my quarters and pull out the book and take less than an hour to  theres five things now  matt okay yeah because you rolled really high on that investigation check what are the five things  liam it was the stone shaped like a feather it was the orb it was a potion it was the /none/ agate  stone and the studded leather armor  taliesin whoa thats a lot  sam theres also some coin that needs to be  matt correct no coin from the ship however you did manage to muster in the time that you  gathered beneath there 48 copper pieces  laura between us or each  matt overall you can divide as you see fit if you choose not to divide i can give you  individual amounts  laura no no no  matt 31 silver pieces  marisha 31 silver  matt 323 gold pieces  marisha /none/ 323  matt 14 platinum pieces  laura woo  travis not too shabby  sam are we dividing it up among the group  laura i think everybody gets 2 platinum  sam ill do the math  marisha i would like to point out that maybe we should set a little bit aside to  taliesin pay the crew  marisha  pay the crew  travis they die before we reach the shore what no kidding  laughter  taliesin wow  marisha everyone took a second to be like  matt in the background from over /none/ the side  travis he jumps over  matt no you see this little turtle head go heh  taliesin jesus  matt if theres any other business you want to take care of during this fourandahalfday journey  travis i would i would like to ask beau and anyone else that lives in the empire if they could  tell me a little bit more about where they live and who is the most concerned about the news that  we received about the war moving south  marisha well i dont know i cant speak for caleb the /none/ other empire kid  liam busy  marisha huh  liam busy  marisha hes busy  travis hes looking stuff up youre from  marisha im from kamordah  travis right we came through the wuyun gates  matt wuyun gorge  travis right here  marisha according to the information they came all the way here to felderwin which is where nott  is from  sam thats where im from  marisha my concern was that they mentioned that they used mountain passages if you took this  mountain passage all the way through felderwin you would /none/ go along this route my concern was that  you could easily go east in that path and hit kamordah i dont know  travis maybe well just see its at the discretion of everyone once were off the boat  im not the captain anymore i dont know where the urgency lies  marisha i have no desire to go rushing back to my hometown i think id prefer to go back to zadash  and check in personally  travis even with an army bearing down on it you have family there  marisha what are we going /none/ to do to stop an invading army  travis warn your folks get them out of harms way no  marisha i dont know i honestly dont even know if theyd believe me if i told them to run so  whats the point maybe we could better organize our efforts together in a larger city like zadash  or go check in on notts family first  travis beau i want to honor what youve said but you only get one family are you sure that  whatevers transpired between you is too much to drop a note  /none/ marisha actually i got a note from my parents when i was at the cobalt reserve at the cobalt  soul it seemed very clear that they didnt really want me to come back my mother actually ended up  birthing a son while i was at the monastery so they got what they wanted got rid of me and  thought that it would be best if we all parted ways i took that letter as a goodbye and decided  to continue on my way  travis you have a brother now  marisha i have a baby /none/ brother that ive never met  travis no other siblings  marisha nope  travis arent you at all concerned that he might be an innocent in all this he has your blood  running through his veins  marisha i dont know i guess i never thought about it like that i never met the kid its hard  to feel concern about something you have no real personal connection with whether theyre your  blood or not i dont know  travis maybe think about it him at least could give the kid a chance  marisha yeah /none/  travis youll know what to do  marisha i guess he could be okay i dont know anyway what about you nott are you here  sam i dont know am i  marisha yeah i think so  sam hi  liam you guys are on deck right im not there  sam what about me what do you mean what about me i just want to get off this fucking water  marisha should we go check in in felderwin  sam i wouldnt mind swinging by if were going that way just for a quick check /none/ in i dont know  what our ultimate plan is do we need to go to any more ball places  travis no i think were fine for a while my first priority was getting jester back to her  momma for a hot minute if we could  sam how do we do that  travis i think were pretty sneaky weve learned some tricks wouldnt hurt to check out the  fucking building that grows and shrinks as you approach it  taliesin i wouldnt say no to that  laura we are in a completely different boat /none/ at least ship ship  sam ship  laura we can make ourselves look different than when we left  travis if were heading up into the empire we got to go through the wuyun gate anyway  marisha interesting point though we forged papers for the mistake correct  travis yeah  marisha do we have papers for the balleater yet  travis and sam no  marisha ownership slips  travis in searching the captains quarters would we have discovered any sort of papier  matt nope everything was removed at darktow  travis yep all right well /none/  marisha might want to make some more  laura singing looks like ill be forging some more speaking i can do that  marisha you made the first one pretty good  laura yeah i remember how i did it too  travis or we go full sail into port crash into the docks caleb sets off fireball as a diversion  we run in and hide among the corpses of the innocents that are scattered about i have a problem  laughter  laura i think thats a good plan captain  marisha well touch on nicodranas forge /none/ some papers check in with mom from there head  towards felderwin  sam fjord do you have closure here on the open seas are you good  travis yeah im good  marisha what exactly happened down there by the way  laura yeah did you release it or what  travis no i did have another vision it seemed like ukotoa was straining against whatever  confines it was in but not released i saw a vision of another maybe final temple location  laura where  travis i saw a shore with three cities along the coast /none/ and then a forest beyond that just before  you got to a rocky mountain ridge there was a single glowing light  laura wait a coast with three cities thats the menagerie coast  travis it could be i dont really care for now  marisha are you afraid  sam did you learn who you are  travis no and the thing i wanted the most was in some of these i saw a vision of vandran  whether as a statue or in a reflection or something i didnt see anything nothing  taliesin vandran hm  /none/ laura thats his mentor  travis ive run out of leads there i dont really know where that leaves me on that but  weve spent enough time on me i dont have anything else to follow besides theres danger coming  laura i could still send a message to the plank king and see if he answers  liam caleb wanders back up at this point and starts listening  travis maybe we let a little bit of time go by but thank you  marisha are you in the slightest bit concerned that ukotoa might start speaking to /none/ you and  putting more ideas in your head  travis not yet i feel like were good for a while i couldnt tell you why well see it  might be good to ask anyone if they know anything about ukotoa or if there are offsetting deities  or gods he seemed incredibly powerful and i have to admit i was a little unnerved seeing him push  against his constraints in that way i dont know maybe theres more to be learned  laura did he talk to you  travis just those single words he says things /none/ like learn and adapt  taliesin perhaps the tower the strange tower that grows perhaps theres answers in there or  someone who might know  travis could be  marisha hey what does your falchion look like still have the eyeball in it is that still there  travis yeah i summon it  matt you look and see there is still the single eye thats always been in the middle of the hilt  since your encounter with the merrow that first found it  marisha cool that was my favorite part it wouldve been sad if it /none/ went away  liam im sorry im coming into this midway am i to take it we are headed to the mainland  travis yes yeah  liam oh thats good news  travis take it up into the empire by way of nicodranas  marisha were going to go check in on felderwin  liam oh that is a good idea so you dont mean to pursue this any further right now  travis no no and if i can id like to find some way out of it  liam i was going to ask you does it /none/ concern you to turn away from this things desires do you  worry it will abandon you leave you a mere mortal again  travis yes i like how i am now and to answer your question i have no idea ive only been in  its favor i dont know what the other side would be like  liam but you intend to leave the sea for now  travis yeah  laura do you think he can read your thoughts  travis no i dont know  laura i mean if what hes telling you to do is /none/ go towards the coast that is what youre doing  so maybe he still thinks youre on his side  travis chuckles  liam you dont even know do you  travis no  marisha time might be on our side going off of jesters point a hundred years can sometimes seem  like five minutes for these godlytype beings maybe hell be content for a while  travis im out of my depth i have no idea i dont know any more than you do all i know is im  ready to get off the sea for a /none/ bit unless i hear otherwise alls well no reason to assume otherwise  sam lets go  laura do you think the wildmother can hear your thoughts  taliesin well i know the wildmother knows everything  laura so if you think something dirty she knows what if youre thinking oh man i really got to poop  taliesin stuttering sure  laura what if youre thinking aww man i think i smell a little bit today ive got a booger in  my nose  taliesin now im thinking about that  laura what if you think oh does /none/ my breath smell bad  taliesin does it  laura no your breath smells fine but  taliesin are you sure  laura yeah you smell pretty good  taliesin oh thats nice thinking about this  sam speaking of stinky caleb what did we get whats all the stuff  liam ive been in the ocean for days and days  travis hes the most sterile hes ever been  laura what did we get what did we get  liam first i want you to admit that i have been washed from top to bottom for a month /none/  taliesin i think you smell fantastic  liam you are a nice fellow  taliesin thank you but no really i actually do think you smell better than nice  liam you see  laura i didnt say youre stinky nott said you were stinky caleb i think you smell like salt  and fresh air  sam like a douche  liam revved up it was very interesting im so tired there is one of these things that i am  going to keep  laura what is it  liam its a lucky rock  laura oh /dung/ fun lucky rocks are nice  liam there is another thing here that i probably should keep but i dont have to this bauble  lights up and floats and lets us see in the dark  sam floats like in the air floats  liam yeah hovers a bit  sam like a lantern  liam i set it floating five feet above the deck of the ship  matt that glass sphere that you found beneath you watch as caleb speaks the command word  liam it is tawaj  matt it rocks and lifts off the ground /dung/ and hovers and gives off a nice soft white torchlightlike glow  laura does it flicker is it like a hue light  marisha can it change colors  liam not exactly but its dark at this point isnt it  matt yeah its probably evening  liam so if i say fajar  matt suddenly it gives off this extremely powerful vibrant daylight the entire ships deck  feels like its suddenly midday  laura thats really bright  travis and you hear cannon firing as we give away our location  liam very specific use cases for that /none/ i pluck it out of the air and it should dim one of you  could carry it but since i am normally blind as a bat beauregard has her glasses  travis yeah of course  sam what else what else  liam all right so i will take both of these things  marisha whats the other thing youre keeping a rock thing  liam a lucky rock yes  marisha whats a lucky rock do  laura its like a pet rock but it brings you luck  marisha does it allow you to reroll things like /none/ the lucky feat said not as beau just as marisha  liam no it does not let you reroll things  marisha so whats it let you do  liam this is a potion that makes one extremely strong for a short period of time  laura you should give that to fjord  liam fjord yasha  travis fuck off  laughter  laura i go over to fjord and hug him around the waist and pick him up im just kidding with you  travis ah my backs popping  liam i honestly was thinking yasha and if /none/ not yasha then you jester  sam to make you super strong  laura well what else do you have i dont want to claim that if theres better things  liam i stick that into my pocket thats just a loaner in my pocket i dont want it caduceus i  thought this would be good for you im holding up a small stone leaf i hand it to him dont put  that on the deck please because it will turn into an actual tree  laura will it turn into a tree in your pocket  sam /none/ more than once or just once  liam it doesnt say on here i assume  matt just once  liam oh one time only  taliesin weve got a tree until we need it  travis an instant fucking bigass tree  matt 60foottall tree yeah  travis its like a ladder  sam we could get into a tower or something  matt or fuck up somebodys ceiling really bad  taliesin thats a lot of tree  liam and then beauregard this armor you found is quite exquisite but you dont wear armor do you  marisha /none/ not generally  liam no its a bit hard to do all the flipping around that you do  marisha i like full range of movement in many things that i do  travis caduceus does i do  laura and sam i do  liam yeah it would be good for any of you this particular one was a little better at protecting  you but also you can speak to this thing and make the armor look like anything you like  marisha oh fuck that would be great to have  liam it would be yeah but /none/ it doesnt work for monks you can make it look like robes or the  fanciest golden armor you can think of or a clowns outfit or you can make yourself look like  fjords clothes its an instant change of clothes  marisha everyone else can do that already  liam its clothes though its clothes  travis does it come with any protective  liam yeah thats the first thing i said its above average  travis i dont remember much  taliesin do you need above average are you already bumped  laura im in studded leather /none/ armor  sam as am i  taliesin im in a breastplate  marisha thats what it is its studded leather  liam studded leather plus one  taliesin either of you would get a bonus to that  liam and its endless its limitless am i reading that right  matt yeah whenever you want to it can transform to any outfit you want  taliesin either of you would be hilarious owning this  sam my armor class is less than yours  laura yeah go for it plus you dont have a disguise self  sam i /none/ do  laura yeah you should take it  marisha pretty much everyone can disguise themselves  sam jester and laura are fighting right now  laura you should take it  sam ill look at it well play cards for it  liam should we give this to yasha fjord jester this potion  travis yeah well hold it for yasha i bet its giant  laura let me see it whoa  taliesin its one fight just become a beast  laura holy shit yeah she should have it because that will affect her attacks right  matt /none/ anyones melee attacks any of your strength checks for an hour someones strength becomes badass  travis yasha drinks it immediately no  matt no  marisha i was thirsty  travis whoa  taliesin yeah  travis thats a thing that took me a long time to get to that  marisha for 23 hours  matt no lasts for one hour  taliesin yeah youll get disqualified from a lot of sports for taking that thats for horses  travis should we get to work on forging those documents for when we make our way in  laura /none/ yes yes yes i know what all these kind of ship documents look like i already forged  some and also im around ships and stuff  matt for this add your proficiency bonus for the forgery kit as well as your dexterity to attempt  to actually for this use intelligence this isnt copying documents this is forging  documentation that seems to  laura you made me do this last time you made me use intelligence i think  matt were doing intelligence because this is trying to create verbiage and documentation that  you think will seem /none/ officious and believable  laura i think caleb youre very officious can he help me sound more intelligent than i am  matt he can aid you and you can have advantage on the roll if he wants to help  laura should i look at the mote you guys should i look at the mote  travis the mote the shred of fate or whatever  laura yeah  liam you should take a look at the mote and i will assist you if you care  laura okay im going to look at the mote of possibility  /none/ matt it gives you a mote of possibility but it is the dodecahedron  travis i was like when did we start calling it the mote  matt crystal box whatever you want to call it  laura okay so im rolling intelligence  matt intelligence and proficiency bonus  laura at advantage because calebs helping me  matt correct  laura im going to reroll again with my mote  matt okay you roll one more d20  laura thats so much better than the two and the four that i rolled originally 19 plus one is 20  /none/ plus proficiency is three so 23  matt using calebs aid and the time you have on the ocean waiting for periods of relatively calm waters  laura plus i think im proficient with forgery kit oh i understand  matt its all good you do manage to create a number of documents that both declare the  ownership of the ship create a false log of various journeys that youve taken in the ship as  well as forging a few signatures of individuals at brokenbank that have checked in the ship in the  past whose name is /none/ it under  laura whose name should the ship be under  sam tusktooth  laura should it be tusktooth or should it be somebody thats not a piratey name  marisha yeah thats legal  laura yeah a new sort of name do they know any of your names in nicodranas i mean it could be anybody  liam do we want it to be one of us  laura caleb you could look pretty officious  travis yeah but we dont need any sort of official record tying us  sam what about orly hes a reputable nicodranian /none/  laura we would be giving the ship to orly  travis orly  matt mmhmm  travis in no less than 30 words describe to me why you should have this ship  matt captain i couldnt possibly you see him really wrestling with the idea i can certainly  caretake it in your absence you intending to mmmosey on northward right  travis further inland what i think im saying is the ship is yours once we reach nicodranas  you can sell it you can take care of it whatever you see fit youve done right by /none/ us  matt he thinks for himself and goes mmighty generous i can claim ownership by name only but  we all know who the captain of this ship is if youre going upward to the empire i can put the  crew to work earn a little bit of money for us and you when you come on back may be a little  bit of gold in it for you but the ship is always yours  travis that sounds quite agreeable orly  matt mmhmm  travis thatll be all  laura is orly your first name /none/ or your last name  matt first name doll  laura whats your last name orly  matt skiffback  laura skiffback right  matt anyway goodnight he turns around makes his way  travis bring him with us make him fight  laura i really want a tattoo from him at some point  marisha yeah did you learn how to do that from him  laura we havent done it  liam it costs a lot  laura well we just need crushed gems in order to make them  marisha i tell jester this my parents when /none/ they were trying to form me into a functional member of  society thought it would be a good idea if i got into jewelry making so i have a jewelers kit  laura so you could maybe crush some jewels  marisha i could crush gems yeah just throwing that out there  laura orly  matt you hear the heavy footfalls of him turning around and slowly coming back to the chambers  mmhmm  laura how hard is it to make a cool tattoo thats pretty the shiny ones  matt well you need the supplies  /none/ laura yeah  matt i told you  laura yeah like 2200  matt baseline then depending on the kind of tattoo the cost tends to increase  sam we dont have that kind of  laura we dont have that kind of jewels  taliesin not yet one day  laura okay  matt when you do happy to help  laura okay okay okay thanks orly  matt no worryin turns around and makes his way back out  travis as orly no worryin now  taliesin im going to gather some of my stuff and go to /none/ the crows nest get everybody  liam oh youre going up  taliesin yeah  liam do you like a good book  taliesin im not going to be reading up there but  liam i dont mean for tonight in general  taliesin ill admit im not the best reader but ive read a couple books  liam but you have one of the books that we found in that ball of fun is about the corruption of plants  taliesin i would be curious  liam i thought you might be  taliesin if you could leave it /none/ in my quarters that would be most agreeable  liam surely  taliesin thank you  liam mmhmm im glad you are traveling with us  taliesin me too ive never felt so helpful im going to climb up and set up a little ritual  circle in the crows nest and im going to light some incense and im going to pull out a piece of  that weird fruit that ive been slowly growing some mushrooms on getting a little weird eat a  little bit of it im going to meditate and then im going to cast /none/ divination  travis yeah fluffy little clouds  marisha just a light divination  liam just a happy little scry  taliesin im going to feel out into the universe and im going to wait for whatever sign whether  it be verbal or otherwise  wonder what vandrans doing right now  travis stuttering what  matt the warm soft comforting voice like a breeze drifts past your ears as the hot wind  unexpectedly through a cold night drifts past your shoulders staying out of sight making  amends thats all  taliesin thatll do  sam intrigue /none/ secrets  taliesin i head back down  travis whispering what the fuck leave it to taliesin to trip you out with shit you didnt know about  laughter  sam oh boy backstory  matt all right  taliesin im good  matt okay is there anything else you wish to do during this travel or are we going to bring us in nicodranas  marisha i would like to go to caleb really quick and be like hey did you happen to finish that  copy of avantikas code for me  liam yeah  marisha can i /none/ get it  liam yeah  marisha thanks  liam that it  marisha yep i go to my chambers and for the rest of the time i want to try and memorize her code  matt okay well go ahead and keep that in consideration itll take you a little bit most  of the trip itll help you for a while you might want to keep it with you just as a reference point  marisha okay at some point in time like halfway through i go back to caleb after 24 hours with  it i was /none/ like okay im trying to memorize this i figured it might be useful because you know this  code you memorized this code you have a photographic memory i figure if were ever in  trouble we can write messages in this code not too many people know it  liam ja if you want to take some time with that and then we could use it sure  marisha yeah ive been doing that  liam okay  marisha hesitating will you help me tutor me it might go a little faster  liam okay no time like the /none/ present lets go get to work  marisha okay  matt all right cool you spend the rest of the trip working together to try and memorize it to  the best of your ability it is a complicated cipher its not like this equals a this equals  b theres layers to it but you manage to get the broad strokes of it and you can keep that with  you if you want to  marisha i do  matt all right  taliesin im going to read that book too but yeah well talk about it later /none/  matt yeah no worries  laura im going to try to spend the time on the deck teaching sprinkle how to fetch an item like  if i show sprinkle a button and hide it somewhere i want sprinkle to be able to get the button and  bring it back to me  matt okay go ahead and make an animal handling check for me  laura 20  matt okay sprinkles still a little skittish after some of the experiences on the seas but  seems to have gotten a little more comfortable thankfully there isnt a /dung/ lot of chaos since you  guys left the archipelago over the next few days sprinkle seems to take to it for the button and  the bits of food and treats that you provide so you seem to have taught a simple trick to your weasel  taliesin on the balleater  matt on the balleater anything else  liam one of the nights while getting into bed and nott curling up at the foot of the bed as we  customarily do  sam we do  liam ja ill wait in the dark and before i think /none/ that she has fallen asleep nott  sam yes  liam how do you feel about returning home  sam oh well i dont know were 100 sure that were doing that but if we did it would be nice  to just sort of swing through and see what because they said there was some damage so maybe  just kind of see what damage has been done and if anyone you know  liam so were just going to buzz through theres nothing you want to check in on or  sam stuttering yeah id like to check /none/ in just see how the place is doing and you know if  everythings still there you know just make sure that everythings okay  liam sometimes it sounds like you dont have much love for home  sam yeah its a little complicated i really didnt like most of it certainly not my clan as  ive told you guys you know theres a few folks that i didnt mind so much there was one  gentleman i wouldnt mind just checking in on make sure hes okay  liam one of your clan  sam stuttering no just /dung/ a friend of mine that
