have the mic working now  travis yes  matt perfect there we go welcome back last we left off the mighty nein in following a thread  of information that may tie into some aspect of fjords curious /none/ history after he chestvored a  sphere discovered that apparently a group of individuals were hired to retrieve this and bring  it to a captain avantika upon following this thread you found your way to the city of  nicodranas on the menagerie coast outside the dwendalian empire you met up with yasha once  more you happened to take care of a man who was bothering jesters mother very thoroughly upon  coming upon this character marius lepual who youve been following you got into an altercation  at the docks and accidentally took their boat however you /none/ managed to sneak your way back to  nicodranas the following day before it seemed there was much of an uproar searching for you you  stealth hired a crew including bringing orly the tortle bard on as your navigator and made your  way out to sea towards this island called urukaxl that you believed may have been the one based on  this piece of a map that you had recovered within the ship the mist you changed the name of the  ship to the mistake you became captain tusktooth was it  travis yes  marisha /town/ yes own it yes  travis i mean yeah  matt following the map you made your way through the reef taking on a bit of water briefly but  thankfully through some ingenuity some quick repairs and the tenuous use of a magical tent  you kept it from sinking and going towards the shoreline of urukaxl there appeared to be another  ship a larger ship waiting in the nearest bay upon attempting to possibly make your way around  it to run it aground the ship seemed to be cutting you off and fired a warning cannon /none/ shot  across the bow you decided it was best to stop and began to gather yourselves as two small  rowboats were making their way towards the outside of the mistake to whatever ends that may come to  caleb are you still below deck holding onto your spell  liam yeah  matt good because i believe that is where we left off mighty nein as you see these two small  boats slowly rowing their way towards you from the far side of the bay what do you do  marisha fjord  travis yeah  marisha /none/ is this like one of those like a parfait whats it called  sam oh with the yogurt those are really good  marisha no not that one when you talk with other people who know how to sail  travis parlay  marisha that one  travis yeah i think it will be a parlay unfortunately  marisha oh parfaits are bad  laura why unfortunately  travis well i dont know who these people are what kind of ship theyve come in on i mean this  can go one of two ways either very amicably or we /none/ all die  laura do you think its the captain avantika  travis oh i dont know do we have a spyglass onboard this ship lead anything  marisha ooh oh caleb gave me his frumpkin frumpkin  laughter  travis i said a spyglass and you pulled out a bird  marisha frumpkin go spy on the ship  laughter  matt thankfully the intelligent creature managed to swoop up before hitting the surface of the  ocean there frumpkin continues to head off towards the other ship at this point in time the  rest of the rowboats /none/ travel just about to reach the bottom of the mistake  travis oh theyre that close  matt well yeah as youre waiting here if theres anything else you want to prepare in the  meantime i know you had said you changed your form to look like the previous captain  travis yeah so im going to look like the halforc captain was i close enough to hear him  talk when he was on the dock  matt no you were far away  travis shit fuck balls ass okay so im going to make myself look like /none/ him  matt yeah it was less that you were far away and more that you were in the water and then made a  thunder strike and then were far away and then he was paralyzed  travis yeah i know we dont have to relive it  matt sorry  liam from down below inside the bubble of leomunds tiny hut i pull out the wire and i cast  message up to fjord and say i have plugged the bottom of the ship so i think our troubles are  behind us now  laughter  travis /none/ can i reply to that message  matt mmhmm  travis were about to be boarded by fucking pirates  laughter  applause and cheering  sam tell him they might have yogurt with them  travis can i make myself look like the captain jawgrasp but can i put like a bloody bandage  around my throat as if i suffered a wound and ill talk like this  matt you can certainly try yeah  travis okay  laura fjord do you want us to look like anything along with you or should we just look like ourselves /none/  travis well i mean not that youre already really super dangerouslooking but maybe you  could like menace it up a little bit  laura okay i look like me only menacing  sam what your eyebrows just go like this  laura like that and like i put a lot of cool tattoos on my arms and like i make my fangs even longer  matt okay i envision like the anime girl where like all of a sudden the eyes are covered in shadow  laura yeah  matt yeah perfect  laura my dress is like /none/ tight now  matt all right  cheering  matt anybody else  taliesin i dont even know how to interpret this kind of input god first of all i want to see  how many people are in these boats coming in are they  matt make a perception check  travis im going to roll a perception check  sam first roll  taliesin its terrible but im pretty perceptive so thats where is that 12  matt theyre getting pretty close so its not a terrible dc at this point in time there are two  figures /none/ in one boat and a very large figure in the other alone one of the boats is like sinking in  the water or not really sinking but is definitely pushing towards the boundaries of  buoyancy the other boat however seems to carry two figures one looks to be a female a little  older maybe in 50s or 60s the other figure seems to be the one thats rowing  laura what does her jacket look like i mean sorry  matt i will say you cannot quite make out that detail from this distance  taliesin looks /none/ like a jacket  matt are you lowering any of the rope ladders or  travis yeah no hold on i know the name  cheering  travis yeah im going to tell beau to go activate the windlass and lower the anchor  marisha i go over and i smack yashas ass is that wait thats what you said right no nope  travis the windlass  marisha the wind lass  travis yeah and well make sure that flag is nice and high that had the gray  matt you got it yasha  ashley am i in /none/ your way beau  marisha oh i dont know how to sail so thats all  ashley okay  matt at this point you hear the two dull thuds of the two other small rowboats hitting the bottom  of the ship and you hear the climbing up the side of the boat eventually emerging the first thing  you see is one giant meaty hand come over the top of the side of the ship and rising up you see a  haggard female ogre you see stringy greasy hair thats peeling in front of the face obscuring  /dung/ part of one eye the other one looks to be a bit clouded you can see these like streaks of dark  what wouldve been possibly makeup and beyond that a leather tunic and these thick rippling  muscular arms she eventually gets over the side of the ship and then puts her hand over and helps  the other two up one of them appears to be a gentleman probably in his late 30s mostly bald  a little bit of hair on the sides a light blond and he seems to be a little more demure compared  /none/ to the two immediately his gait and presence seems to be more of at least a lower position on  the hierarchy of the other ship the last one that comes up is the woman that you saw this woman  shes a tougherlooking middleaged woman thicker heftier body weathered face shes  wearing tattered robes but beneath that there is a set of leather armor there is a cutlass to one  side and she has this small amulet thats dangling from a heavy chain around the neck  taliesin oh before they even come up im going to /none/ look like the ships cook i am not looking  aggressive for this i am putting on a chefs outfit and getting small and human with awful red  hair so yeah im out  matt as they step up the ogre looks around at the rest of you and grins with this broken toothy  glare snarls the woman clears her throat and addresses you you are requested to the bows of  the squalleater immediately  sam its the ship thats the ship that she owns  travis pigeon cooing  matt it is recommended by the captain /none/ that you immediately make your way across with whatever  boats you have available theres a space for some with us but should you decline or make any move  outside of complete and utter compliance you and your ship will sink  travis rasping actually funny you mention sinking our boat sustained some damage so if i  could request of the captain perhaps some grace while we go into shore im afraid if we try to  make it to her ship we might be on the bottom of the ocean  laura his throat was slit you /none/ can probably see so he has a hard time talking  matt she turns to you with like an intense glare and goes jawgrasp you seem to have sustained  some sort of terrible wound  travis yes my throat its all fucked up  matt make a deception check with advantage  travis okay  marisha oh yas queen  travis 17  matt if you come with whatever your most immediate crew is and she looks about and says  and it would appear that youve lost most of your previous crew  travis yeah heavy casualties yeah /none/ the butchers bill was very steep yep  matt so you bring unproven individuals into our plans  travis it would seem that way  laughter  travis but these are battlehardened men and women every one of them  laura arr  marisha ah ha  laughter  sam yo ho ho  matt the woman glares back and forth across the troupe of you and goes well then some of you  come onto the ship the rest take it into shore with bouldergut points to the ogre and the ogre  goes grunts to shore  travis /none/ jesus do you think you can accommodate seven of us on your two craft  matt do you not have a ship of yourself  travis do we  laura i mean we have this boat  sam we have a rowboat  matt you have a rowboat  travis we have a rowboat  laughter  travis we will accompany you to the squalleater  matt then come please she immediately starts to climb down with the help of bouldergut the  ogre down into one boat the helper that she was with goes down with her and there /none/ are now the two  rowboats and the rowboat that you have at your disposal it looks like the ogre is staying  onboard to help whoevers behind take the mistake to shore  travis ill turn to the rest of the crew and be like just do whatever she he she says  matt snarls big big grin the rest of the crew who has known you for three days goes like huh  they start getting the ropes ready start pulling the anchor up  travis nott make sure that caleb comes with us hes awful grumpy below /none/ decks he needs to be on  the part of the boat with us  sam you want me to go get caleb  travis yeah go get fucking caleb  sam okay okay  laughter  sam i think in addition to your throat getting slashed you mightve sustained a bump on the head  or something ill go get caleb i run downstairs  travis hes a terrifying fighter just make sure hes on the boats  sam ill go get caleb  matt okay as youre sitting there concentrating with all this going on the tension of /none/ what we  were just told by fjord a moment ago you watch as nott runs down to grab you  liam yeah im inside a giant sphere of glass basically  sam can you keep it going but not be here because we have to go we have to go  liam no i cannot do that i have to stay here in this bubble or the boat will sink presumably  sam will it sink quickly or slowly  liam well it lasted between ten and 20 minutes while i got this going but i am not a /none/ boat  expert thats fjords mo so i cant say for certain how long this will stay afloat no  sam listen weve got to make this decision on our own hes entrusted me to come get you we  have to go on this boat with these pirates or else well all be killed can you just temp it in  just like rough it in just sort of close the wound as much as you can  liam nein i cannot do that but i could walk away from this are we all leaving there are  actually /none/ pirates above  sam there are real pirates were going to get on a boat with them and go to another to see other  pirates but everythings okay everythings going to be fine because fjord has convinced them that  hes the guy that we killed before except with a massive throat laceration  liam okay i am trying to process this as quickly as i can im glad that i spent all the time  making this lets go fuck it i walk out of leomunds tiny hut it goes whooshes gone  matt okay you watch as /none/ this sphere immediately vanishes as you exit the exterior of it and what  brief repairs were placed against there seem to hold for the time being there is a slow leak you  do see it is taking on water but it is at the moment a trickle  laura is gallan still down there fixing it up  matt in the rest of this journey when you came out of the reef gallan had done his best to  repair it but theres only so much you can patch something like that it may hold for a while /none/ who  knows gallan literally as this is happening sees the leak and goes like okay you know this is  it should work as long as we dont stay out here for too long i think well be okay  liam yeah as we go up topside i say quietly to nott you know i did not allow for gallan to go  inside the bubble so its all the same to him lets go  sam all right lets go  matt great perfect have fun wherever youre going  sam oh yeah youll be fine down here /none/ well send word soon  matt you said something about pirates  sam clears throat no high rats there were rats on the top of the mast and we took care of them  matt make a deception check  travis no good at these  sam 16  matt he goes oh i mean i hate fucking rats  sam yeah  matt im glad you took care of them that gets real bad as far as the food stores down here in  the cargo hold thank you for that  sam aye aye  matt all right /none/ toodaloo sits down and gets himself an orange unaware  travis that poor bastard  matt all right you guys make your way back to the deck of the ship  liam yeah and going up also i grab hold of that leather thong thats tied around my thigh and i  cast mage armor on the way up  matt okay good to know  laura ooh leather thong  matt i hope thats written in your inventory  marisha hey caleb i took frumpkin and i threw him overboard to go spy on things if you do that /none/  thing where you get all hazy we might see shit dont do it right now wait till were on the yeah  liam okay  marisha your birds spying on pirates  liam tally ho  marisha okay  matt all right so are you all getting in the boats or are some of you staying behind  whats the plan  laura lets all get in the boats  taliesin i think better together than not  matt all righty all of you make your way down into one of the three boats and begin rowing your  /none/ way across this gulf to the ship now as you approach this ship you can see its a massive  trimast ship you can see where those doors were open there are large heavy cannons facing your direction  travis coming out of the gun port  cheering  matt yeah im so proud of you  laura travis you look really hot  cheering  liam mocking ha ha youre so pretty  matt from the gun ports on the gun deck or the tween deck as its sometimes called  cheering  matt anyway so as you make /none/ your way towards this massive ship the large rope i want to say  a ladder more than a giant netlooking ladder is thrown over the side that hits and breaks the  surface for a bit so that it floats the boats come up to the side and the older woman is inside  the boat gives a look to the rest of you and goes after you  laura arr  travis ill go first  sam i think its women and children first that are supposed to go actually  travis no thats not right at all /none/  sam okay  matt all right  sam youll go first fjord  travis sure yep i mean yes  matt as you guys are climbing you see the mistake is now being led over towards shore you  make your way to the top of the deck and as you come across one by one you see there waiting for  you is about ten figures all in various scattered bits of seafaring attire leathers and billowing  cloths that seem to have seen many a journey out here on the open lucidian ocean immediately your  attention /none/ is grabbed by the central figure a female elf with light brown skin with red wild  hair that falls in clustered strings around her face and down the back you see shes wearing a  long sleeveless gray coat with a high collar that bends at the edge of the shoulders with a thick  scarf around her neck you see she has heavy elbowlength gloves and kneehigh boots that look  weathered with use and probably brutality they are stained in places where that could only have  been acquired by meeting the face of somebody else as /none/ you step up she has her arms crossed in  front of her cocks her head to the side and looks to you specifically and goes french accent  well hello captain you have returned from your journey jawgrasp  travis oui  laughter cheering  travis we suffered heavy damage and casualties but we have returned successful  matt successful well wondrous please give me the item requested  laughter  marisha sorry when he means successful he means unsuccessful  matt who are you  marisha  im  matt captain it would appear to me that you /none/ have brought the mist all this way across our  specific route through the reef with a crew that i have not met please introduce me  travis oh yes we actually came under such heavy heat we had to rebrand the ship as the mistake  matt this surprises me not at all  laughter  travis yeah yep we came across some new crew may i introduce  marisha tracy  laughter cheering  marisha tracy the bowman  travis tracy bowman next to tracy you will see  liam oh phillip  laughter cheering  liam my /none/ name is phillip bonejour  travis phillip is a talented bosun may i also introduce the tall and powerful  ashley hello my name is janet  laughter  sam whatd she say  laura janet  sam oh janet  ashley i do various things on the ship for him and you know so many things just all of the  things that need to be done  laughter  matt she nods along with a very confused look on her face  ashley argh  laughter  marisha thats good shes great  liam were all going to /none/ die  taliesin cornelius and i apologize for the way im dressed right now i was in the middle of  well its obvious i was making a stew this really nice vegetable stew and everything went  topsyturvy so quick i dont even  ashley it was so good  taliesin its very good stew  ashley hes very talented  travis hes a talented cook that one what was your name again  taliesin cornelius  travis corneli yeah the food just blows your mind  taliesin sometimes they call me stew because i  matt cornelius very /none/ well i look forward to seeing what you are capable of cooking up cornelius  taliesin oh im very excited  matt this one  laura im a pirate  laughter cheering  sam hashtag im a pirate  laura im pirate sapphire  audience aww  matt shes adorable  laura argh thanks  matt what about this little runt you brought on  sam im gilligan  laughter cheering  sam i was told this was only going to be about three hours long to be honest with you i thought  we were going on a pleasure /none/ cruise but you know ive met some people and weve had a great time  and yeah really nice boat you got here  matt she turns back to you and begins to walk a circle around you arms behind her back now  folded jawgrasp so you come to me with a new crew and you tell me that you are successful but  yet you are not describe to me what transpired to prevent you from acquiring this thing you have paid for  travis well you see we now know the location of the artifact you seek /none/ its as good as ours  matt how did this terrible terrible thing happen to you she reaches up and touches the  side of your neck  travis oh god  matt her hand passes through  travis its real sore  matt the illusion and she steps back and goes  groaning  laura shit shit shit  travis all part of the plan  matt i must commend you it has been a very long time since someone has been so bold with such  massive balls to come onto my ship and i think that perhaps /none/ i got where i am today not by seeing  through a few paltry illusions  travis well i must commend you on your perceptiveness my balls are quite large  cheering  travis i will drop the mask  matt you drop the the disguise self okay as you say that and the disguise self drops you hear a  series of sounds that you hadnt really heard in succession before clicking  groaning  matt as you see most of the crew now wielding some variation of the firearms you had seen both  in hupperdook or the /none/ traveling armies of the empire eastward towards the boundaries of xhorhas  laughter  matt have them trained on the lot of you the captain still now has her hands crossed in front  of you and goes well i guess now that we are out in the open who the fuck are you and how did  you come in the possession of the mist  travis that is a wonderful story one that i would love to share you have the honor of being  in the company of the mighty nein  cheering  matt but there /none/ are only seven of you  laughter  travis its a long story but im afraid we wont be able to tell it or further converse unless we  have an atmosphere of equal exchange here and this hostile act is not a step in the right  direction captain  matt so you are the captain of that ship are you suggesting that we parlay  laughter  marisha yes say yes fjord say yes  travis yes  matt very well well since youve been so forthright tracy phillip sapphire cornelius  janet and gilligone  travis laughs /none/ gilligone hon hon  matt welcome aboard the squalleater i am captain avantika now the fact that you are here  that youve made your way across the reef that you managed to best our sister ship and the crew  on board which i assume have all been dispatched  travis indeed  liam just out of curiosity if i look back over my shoulder do i still see a boat  travis oh yeah  laughter  matt you do you do  cheering  matt its noticeably lower in maybe a short ten minute period itll be /none/ finding its way onto the beach  travis its also got a giant fucking ogre on it now  matt yeah  marisha can i look around real quick and see if i see frumpkin  matt make a perception check  marisha sleeves are so big shit i think that was an eight  travis get your hat out of the way  marisha this is not a good dice for this lighting 11  matt you look around real fast and you see a few birds are perched up in the sails but you dont  know which /none/ ones frumpkin if frumpkins up there one of them does look small might be him  marisha i lost another fucking owl goddamn it  liam i hear her say that and for ten or 15 seconds jump into frumpkins vision to see what i see  matt right now you look up and you can see through frumpkins vision down on the deck  frumpkin has a view from above and is present the captain continues well then my next question  is what are you planning here why have you gone to all this trouble to kill my /none/ crew to bring the  ship right back to me and then to be perfectly honest prostrate yourself before us  travis well i imagine there must be a hefty reward for the item that you seek we went through  great troubles just to acquire it  matt troubles  travis perhaps  matt do you know the purpose of this item  travis yep  laughter  matt she looks at you with an eye that has tore through a thousand lies and gives a surprising  smile of acknowledgement interesting well youve proven that you are talented /none/ at least to  have survived this far but im a bigger fan of loyalty talent and loyalty well that is  obviously my birthday as it stands the mighty nein there are two paths you can walk you one  could live under the crew and proves yourselves as both skilled and as trustworthy as i hope you may  be if our goals are indeed aligned perhaps even join us if the deeds please me or two we weigh  your corpses down with rocks and leave you here amongst the reef  laura those are the only /none/ options there  laughter  matt im afraid so little sapphire  laura cool  matt captain what was your actual name  travis fjord  matt captain fjord whatll it be  travis its actually captain tusktooth but clears throat  matt well stick with fjord  travis cornelius what say you in this highly delicate matter  taliesin i dont know ive got some very specific burial needs if were actually going to  go that way  laughter and cheering  taliesin im unhappy with everything at the moment i would really like to negotiate some base /none/  points of this deal  matt at the moment you say this you feel this cold sensation in the back of your skull as one of  the cocked rifles is now pressed up against the base of the head  taliesin do i know what a rifle is  matt you have a no idea  laura you know what a co  taliesin ah thats cold laughs oh thats really cold oh ooh  matt she goes there is no negotiation im sorry but the choice you make now that is  travis that is not necessary /none/ we would absolutely love to prove our loyalty in your service  sam i would say this though just as a curious tourist if you were to kill us you would not find  the location of the item  matt well based on the fact that you brought yourselves this far to tell me that you have it i  would assume that its somewhere either on your ship across the way that i currently am in  possession of or its on your person so we could rummage through your bodies to find it afterwards  laughter  /none/ marisha how far would that rummaging entail just curious how far you would look  laura have you ever seen the fifth element  laughter cheering  laura its a really popular play i dont  matt im afraid im not as involved in the arts as some perhaps she puts her hand up and raises  her fingers twice and you feel the pressure of the barrel back off and all the guns eventually  they stay trained on you but they pull back a bit and go lax a little bit do you agree  sam we dont /none/ have a choice so yes yes  travis its a resounding yes of course  laura yeah  matt well then mighty nein welcome to the squalleater claps all the guns pull back a  bit everyone stays present and theyre keeping an eye on you as much as this agreement has  happened theres still a sense of careful watchfulness from the crew but avantika seems to  drop that intensity and reaches forward a hand to shake yours  sam do we pick our quarters first or do we get assigned roles or is there a uniform that /none/ we need to wear  taliesin does the yogurt come before or after really looking forward to that  matt if youre hungry there are plenty of fruits that have dropped from the trees on the  island first order of business some of my men are going to work to begin repairing my other  ship in the meantime you relax bring your things aboard i would like to question some of  you about what you know  travis by all means  liam hey guys lets steal a boat itll be so much fun  laughter  /none/ matt as the captain turns to the older woman who accompanied you and goes vera let me introduce  you to your charges for the evening  travis vera  mic thuds  travis oh jesus  liam caleb died  laura which one of us was shot caduceus has been shot  laughter  sam sorry guys weve never been on stage before its a learning curve well figure it out  matt the captain i will return in just a little bit but in the meantime vera can answer your  questions dont do anything stupid  laura /none/ never  matt good the captain steps down into her quarters and vera approaches and looks you all  over with a very intense glare all right so welcome are you hungry  sam always yes of course  travis yeah yeah  taliesin usually  matt with me she turns around and begins to leave you begin to see in the distance another  boat one of the boats that you guys had taken to the ship has made its way in the direction of the  mistake what would you like to do while youre here on the /none/ ship  travis ill make my way over to janet yasha and take her by the arm and say you okay with this  ashley well i dont know if i trust her or what she wants with the sphere maybe you should ask  her if she knows what it does  travis if i ask her about it let her know that i dont know anything  ashley shit  travis oh you dont think shed believe me  laura well what if one of us asked her what it does like you wont tell us or something /none/  marisha yeah yeah  travis thats a fine idea yeah like i hoard the information  laura yeah i like that you brought yasha aside and then all of us just  taliesin jumped right in  sam sorry  laura sorry i couldnt help but hear what you  travis very small ship yeah work your magic  laura okay were going to ask avantika if she will tell us  sam if shell tell us  laura yeah because he wont  sam but why would she tell us  laura because were very charming  sam /none/ we are that thats true  laughter  taliesin how long are we going to hold these disguises  laura well i think i look really good so as long as it lasts  taliesin all right  laura then i might make my dress like this permanently because of how sexy i am  cheering  liam are we off on our own a little bit from everyone training guns upon us  matt theyre still watching you youre still on the deck but you have some time to discuss or  anything you want to do  travis /none/ not making any movements to move the ship its just staying  matt at the moment nothing  liam what is our plan here im trying to move my lips as little as possible we go with this for  the time being then when the moment is right we get away or are we just pirates now  laughter  marisha i second that question  travis yeah i third that question so what i have worked out is that we have what she needs we  got to try and find out as much as we can about /none/ why she wants it and what it does where does she  want it for herself or is she taking it somewhere thats about all i got  marisha well i want to figure out if shes just another matchmaker or keeping it for herself if  that is a thing  travis yeah oh shit is marius lepual back on the other ship  matt yep  marisha aw we forgot marius  travis that poor bastard oh shit our fucking tortle  marisha were not leaving though were not leaving anywhere theyre going to fix that ship  /none/ travis they better not sink  laura no she said we could go back and get our things theyre our things  taliesin they need to crew that ship  travis i like orly yeah okay  liam i would warrant a guess that we are stuck here for the time being but i think at a certain  point we are going to want to go and if that happens all of you if you see a window in which  we can get away tell nott or myself and we will start a snow chain  travis and /none/ taliesin a what  liam we will tell our friends that its time to get out of here just find you or me and we  spread it quickly so we dont leave anyone behind like we almost fucked off without caduceus from the docks  laura sorry again about that  taliesin no thats okay i wasnt that worried  travis fair enough i feel like we can make some ground without fighting if we have to i feel like  we can find out what we need and maybe slip away i think thats a great idea  /none/ marisha well okay but still why would we run if we dont know what this thing is inside of you  im assuming you want it out of you right  travis no i kind of fucking like it actually  marisha so we just need information and then we run  taliesin well theyre also fixing the ship at some point theres two ships  laura so wed steal both of them  cheering  taliesin thats pretty cool  travis how about in the meantime keep an eye on the people around right watch what theyre doing  /none/ the things theyre doing on the mast rigging right try and familiarize yourself with working a boat  marisha shit were supposed to learn from these people  travis if you can  liam i think for the time being we are in fact pirates and that fjord youre absolutely  correct learn as much as possible and when the opportunity is right we leave but for now we  have to swiff them they are our new best buddies  travis sure yeah our partners  laura captain tusktooth  travis yes sapphire  laura could you maybe make /dung/ some more of those idiots guides and spread them around through the  rest of us  travis more of the what  laura those guides that you made the sailing guides  laughter  travis this is mine i earned this and its not actually in the game  matt within a short time of you guys having this conversation vera returns to the deck of the ship  and goes the captain would like you to please join her in the quarters below please  laura all of us  matt sure  travis itll be our pleasure /dung/  matt you guys follow vera down below to the dark and it takes a second for your eyes to adjust  going from the bright daylight to the darker quarters in the deck below but youre led to the  captains quarters this beautiful open room with a mismatched patchwork of old carpets that have  all been laid over each other from various designs from around exandria theres a desk that has a  bunch of carve marks into it theres some papers laid out and there you can see avantika sitting  with her legs up on /none/ the desk currently eating on some sort of a tropical fruit watching you all  enter with a bit of a grin on her face please fill the space  travis yeah mind if we partake of your beautiful spread here is there food in this bitch  matt make a perception check  travis 14  matt yes actually on the right side of the room there is a small pack of freshly collected  tropical fruits theres some nuts a cheese thats been designed for longer travel and will  keep well by all means please  sam /tavern/ gobbling  travis thats a candle thats a candle stop eating the candle  laughter  taliesin paring knife  travis no put it back  laughter  sam its a candle bar  matt the doors close behind you but before the doors close all the rest of the crew that were  armed are essentially right nearby waiting to storm in at any given point in time  travis outside the door  matt right outside the door  travis is it essentially us and the captain  matt its just you and the captain from what you /none/ can tell its just you guys  marisha are there like portcullis windows is that no are there windows  matt you see a couple of windows and a doorway behind her that leads to a balcony that looks out  the back of the ship  marisha does she have papers and shit everywhere  matt you see a couple of papers actually you see a familiarlooking map  sam oh  matt akin to what you guys were supposed to have last week but the mail service decided not to  have it we have the map of /none/ the menagerie coast and another map that has a similar layout to what  you found mostly burned in the mist as well as a few other pieces of paper that appear to be tucked  away into portions of the desk  marisha while theyre having a conversation i want to do a scan and see if i can see any  floorboards that look like they can be popped up maybe marks on the floor from chests anything  that looks like it could be a secret compartment  matt make an investigation check actually this would be /none/ a perception check its just a glance  but its going to be a higher dc investigation youd have to actually physically rummage through  the room so make a perception check  liam also glancing around for books  matt both of you make a perception check  marisha yep thats balls big balls fjordsize balls  matt you rolled balls  marisha eight  matt going to get you a d20 that instead of a one it has a pair of balls right there yeah an  eight the room looks pretty solidly made and the floorboard while /none/ there are scuffs to it theres  nothing that gives you the idea that there would be any hidden compartment or any sort of small  cubby that would be out of view whatd you get  liam big 11  matt you do see two books that are laying on the shelf to your left amongst a set of candles  theres a small lantern you see a set of navigation tools that are barely poking out of a  small wooden box yeah there are two books there you cant quite see the binder or if there is /none/  anything written on the sides its pretty plainbound anyways the doors closed the  captain looks to you and goes all right so now that youve agreed to become our friend i would  like to see the first test of you proving your loyalty you have this item i require you have it  here where is it  sam its very dangerous before we tell you anything about it we want to make sure that you  know how to handle it  matt laughs little goblin girl trust me i have a decent idea of what /none/ im doing  sam a decent idea weve seen it do things scary things weve seen someone melt while touching it  matt make a deception check  sam thats a 12 oh minus three a nine  matt she goes nein oh my goodness that sounds terrible well obviously we cannot have  you touching it then  travis if you dont mind my asking  matt please cut through the bullshit for me please captain fjord  travis tusktooth  matt will you tell me if i call you tusktooth  travis yes  matt then captain tusktooth /none/ please tell me  cheering  marisha dont fall for it dont fall for it shes trying to use them titties dont fall for it  travis i know if i could you seem so anxious when was the last time the item was in your  possession im so excited to reunite you with it i feel like if you tell us your story well share  in that sense of triumph  matt respectfully youre not in a position once again to negotiate you tell me and ill  tell you a little back and forth honestly the /none/ one who has to prove their loyalty right now is  not myself  travis youre correct i have it on very good authority that an island that is surrounded by the  deeprow reef is housing the item you seek  matt i wonder how it found its way there make a deception check  travis 20  cheering  matt you know precisely where it lies in the reef  travis i do  matt show me and she pushes forward the map the same similar map to what you were given you  have it with you /none/  travis i do fuck i picked the one reef that doesnt have any goddamn islands she doesnt know  that and im not saying this out loud  marisha secret island  travis yeah yeah oh uncharted islands lets not do that  laughter  travis if you make your way to the deeprow reef right off the shores of vide cay youll find an  unguarded old ruined fort there the item is being protected and held  matt so you stole my ship and came all this way to tell me that this item was not in /none/ your  possession and is another place why were you coming to the island im very confused  travis well you see marquis lepual let us know that you were in dire need of it and that there  was heavy coin and glory in its delivery now as you can see i lost my original crew and found  these bunch of fuckwits you see i do owe them a little bit of coin for their trouble and i sure  would hate to leave them emptyhanded plus i want to see what happens when youre reunited with your /none/ treasure  matt well first off marius lepual is merely a bullshit messenger but im glad at least he  could bring you to us is that all you know about the actual sphere  travis perhaps  laughter  matt shes looking right into you lids halfclosed this dagger stare of trying to read  any sort of give  travis captain i hope you understand that this is not my first rodeo if i were to tell you  everything that i know right now why would you need me alive  matt very well lets trade a /none/ bit the object i have not seen before but i know of it and am  hoping to bring it to this island for a purpose i had recently hired an individual known as jamedi  cosko a very wellestablished adventurer delver of dungeons cosko is a not costco  laughter  travis thats what i heard  marisha thats what i heard too  matt cosko cosko  travis great pizza place  marisha yeah you can get your crew in bulk  travis no no no take it easy  matt to spend a few days across the /none/ jungles of the island to see what there is to be found there  you see this object this sphere it needs to return there is a temple in there that is from  long ago and has been since refitted by its current denizens something at the very bottom of  that temple requires to be reunioned reunited with this thing i seek so  laura what is it at the bottom of the temple  matt does the name ukotoa mean anything to you  travis it sure as fuck doesnt could you say that again slower  /none/ liam yeah im sorry you have a very thick accent sometimes it is  laughter  liam im losing a couple of things here and there no offense  matt she throws a quick dagger in the direction of caleb that drags the cheese from his hand and  sticks to the wall  liam was i eating cheese  matt apparently  laughter  matt you were  liam my perception is so low  laughter  travis stay away from the captains cheese  liam i thought that was a metaphor  marisha that was a tripleaged gouda /none/  laura no but really what did you say what was the name  matt ukotoa spelled uk apostrophe otoa ukotoa the great leviathan  marisha gate of the leviathan  matt the great leviathan  marisha oh the great leviathan  travis do you know what that means  liam i have a good sense of it  marisha its a fucking leviathan  travis i dont know what the fuck that means  sam its in your book  matt her eyes are trained on fjord as she says this well you see i am the chosen of /none/ ukotoa  she pulls the scarf down from under her neck and in the sternum there is a tattoo of an eye  gasping  cheering  marisha wait what tattoo was it youre ukotoa  travis no she is the chosen of  marisha youre the chosen of uko sorry the sound  matt you see this great serpent once ruled the lucidian ocean  travis highpitched serpent  matt your reactions are killing me travis shortly after the calamity washed this land clean  and zehir the cloaked serpent god was banished long away one of his greatest /dung/ creations was left  to rule this ocean ukotoa  laura whispering ukotoa  matt the indigenous people of this series of islands the swavain islands called the kinau  were granted the blessing of ukotoa  laura whispering ukotoa  matt nothing and no one could stand before them however the surviving worshipers of this  oncepowerful god now banished grew jealous and sealed him beneath the rocky depths of the ocean  defaced the temples built in their name i will bring him back and with their blessing these  seas will be mine let me tell you /dung/ youve put in with the proper lot  travis so say we all yeah  matt she puts the scarf back up to hide the tattoo so ive shown you mine you show me yours  cheering  liam caleb is in the background pulling cheese from the wall  laughter  laura are we all supposed to get naked now i dont  matt she doesnt flinch  taliesin actually if were going to be getting ready for some trouble i better change into my  trouble gear if were going there im going to drop disguise self  /none/ matt which puts your head pretty much right into the top  taliesin i try not to frighten people but i figure if were getting messy  matt i love this color palette  taliesin thank you so much i really like this whole room i think youve done a really good job  with it this is great  matt back to fjord  travis just a moment  marisha you have some secret tattoos that we havent seen yet  travis no  sam fjord maybe we should come clean and form an actual partnership with this person /none/ if we keep  lying to her were going to lose  travis nott im pretty sure youre not playing this out all the way that shits in my body okay  laura you guys you realize shes standing right here  laughter  sam were whispering  marisha were stage whispering  laura i turn around and i start dancing to distract her from what were doing  marisha avantika  matt yes make a performance check  laura oh wait oh my god thats good 20  matt you can tell the captains yes but is also peeking /none/ out of the corner of her eye at this  strange display  marisha hold on lets take advantage of this is there anything else we need to talk about  liam well clarifying question did avantika just watch fjord yell at nott that shit is in my body  marisha no no no  liam i want to know  matt you dont know if shes heard it but you guys are in a very enclosed space and she sees you  all deliberating about something that youre all deciding whether or not to reveal shes not like  /none/ oh everythings fine she knows somethings up and shes waiting for someone to come out with it  marisha avantika  matt yes  marisha how can you be certain that youre the only chosen one of ukotoa  travis bless you  sam and laura whispering ukotoa  taliesin ukotoa  travis did you all do that together  taliesin slow but there  matt well im not certain but im the one who has the dreams  travis the dreams  marisha do you see why we did that  sam okay she said dreams she had a /none/ dream  laura you have wet dreams you have wet dreams too  sam you do you have dreams  travis i have dreams  sam you have dreams  matt this big smile curls across her face and you watch her go a little flushed she goes what  kind of dreams  marisha do you often wake up vomiting salt water do you have wet dreams  laughter and cheering  marisha you dont have to be embarrassed  liam you beat me to that by like 02346 seconds  sam she beat you to the wet dream /none/  matt she looks a little confused but says no unlike some i can hold my brine  travis shes not looking at me right im a vocalizing you have dreams ive had dreams of  being deep underwater theres a giant eye that sees me i hear a voice speaking to me but i  cant reply does that ring any bells  matt her smile grows wider so ukotoa has spoken to you as well  cheering  taliesin what are we supposed to be doing  sam whispering ukotoa  matt perhaps it was not some strange /none/ coincidence you found your way here then fjord  travis perhaps not perhaps this is destiny i must tell you i am very eager to see what this  leads to i havent been entirely honest  laughter  the item you seek does not lie on vial coa what the fuck was it called vide cay it does not  reside there i have it protected in an alternate dimension ill use minor image to show the  sphere and make it disappear  laura oh  matt all right  travis if we can work together i would /none/ like to accompany you to this temple you speak of i would  like to see it find its resting place  marisha also were not just some dumbass crew we hired we totally murdered all of your guys so  cheering  sam you know what the craziest part is we dont really know why we did it  cheering  sam were loco  matt avantika is its almost a palpable passion behind her the excitement and adrenaline is  pumping through her body and you can see her now leaning forward in her seat her feet are /none/ off the  desk and her hands are grasping the sides of it in her gloves shes looking across most of you but  focused on fjord and says well im very curious to see where this leads as well then  perhaps let us stay the night onboard lets wait for jamedi to return if hes plotted out the  course to this temple  travis if whos plotted out the course to the temple who  matt jamedi cosko  travis cosko  matt if this is indeed the kismet you speak of what better way to prove /none/ your loyalty to me and my  ship than to be the ones to go into this temple with me  liam yeah absolutely this is an advantageous moment for all of us if we can help you and your  hentai cult achieve your goal  laughter  well all come out as winners this is true if my name is philip  sam it is  matt she looks around to the rest of you claps her hands twice the door opens behind and vera  enters captain you summoned she looks about to the rest of you /none/ in the chamber and turns to her  and goes please clear out some quarters for our guests tell zoen and waldok to sleep on the deck  tonight give them comfortable rooms and bedding please keep a close eye for jamedi any day now  i can feel it we are very close  marisha jamedi is that cosko is jumanji  matt thats cosko yes  liam yes jumanji costco clear as day  travis oh no no no  marisha he makes a note every time  liam the tradition continues  matt somewhere the spirit of /none/ purvan sits next to vaxildan looking down and going come on vera  nods and looks a bit curious well then follow me ill lead you to your chambers as the captain  wishes she looks confused and taken aback by this sudden burst of generosity what are you guys  doing do you follow  sam yeah absolutely  laura i shove a bunch of the fruit in my pockets on the way out is that better  matt there you go  travis as we turn to leave the cabin the captains quarters a quick look of anything /none/ that  looks like info about where this temple is in case she decides to fucking slit our throats in  the middle of the night  matt make a perception check  marisha come on  travis ugh a ten  matt you dont see any indication of the temple or anything but you see now above the door as  youre exiting there is a small shelf you can see a tiny little black iron shrine that looks to  be an ouroboros serpent thats eating its own tail about every inch or so theres an eye  /none/ across the length of its body in the center of it you see a single metal sphere with a similar  cloven line down the center of it  travis awesome  liam also if were leaving the chamber and there were all those people outside with the percy sticks  matt below deck a lot of them have put the rifles away and they have their hands on the side  of their various cutlasses and longswords and shortswords  liam yeah if theres any out maybe theres not but the thing im going to do leaving is to /none/ try to  subtly get a good look at size what i think they are capable of  matt roll an intelligence check you can definitely instantly with your feat the dms bane feat  liam 12  matt you get a quick glance at it from a superficial level you have a good idea of how it  looks youre not entirely certain of the components required  liam can i see at least is it this or this  laura it depends is it a fullycocked rifle or  matt you see about three of them are longer /none/ barrels theyre a twohanded piece there are a  handful that are a simple laura bailey ladies and gentlemen  travis everybody drink yeah laura  taliesin sorry sorry sorry  matt a few of them that have some sort of a flintlock one of them has a multibarrel spinning piece  liam oh okay  matt familiar to some  taliesin strange to others  matt is there anything else you guys wish to do as youre being led to the chambers  marisha is he saying that like were supposed to be doing something  matt no as /none/ you walk and you are led vera tells two of the various deckhands to grab their shit  and leave for the night they confusedly do so and look a bit put out by it but you guys are led to  these two chambers that are more comfortable than at least the area you slept in the mistake  travis as were moving through can we clock sort of whats being kept on the ship are there cells  are there barrels are there packages of things  matt that would be down in the cargo hold which youve /none/ not been led to you guys are currently on  the main upper decks now youre led to your chambers there are still guards posted on the  outside there isnt a complete trust in this regard but its not having weapons trained on you  the entirety of your stay now at least  travis did we previously see what the flag they were flying was and what it looked like i cant remember  matt you didnt pay a very close attention to it but you can go and check if youd like  travis can we do /none/ that now  matt sure you head up to it and the flag actually is an exact or is close to a replica of  the tattoo that she has on her sternum  laura whoa  taliesin impressed whistling  travis that fucking eye  sam the guards posted at our door do they have guns or just like knives and stuff  matt both  sam oh both  matt they have blades sheathed for close combat you know when youre below deck generally you  want shorter blades and things that are good for close quarters the /none/ firearms are more for if they  have to do something at a distance  sam okay  liam so most everyone here is packing then  matt youve seen at least seven or eight of the crew with some form of firearm their make from a  quick glance you saw a lot of their make and construction varies they seem to have been  plucked from different sources  laura captain tusktooth  travis yes  laura doesnt your weapon have an eyeball on it  travis it does  laura thats cool  travis but i dont /none/ want her to know that  laura oh but oh because she would also swallow so she would know that her  weapon would have it  laughter  travis i cant know that for sure but i know that as soon as she has it theres very little  reason to keep us around  laura right  travis caduceus  taliesin yeah  travis would you mind telling me did you feel anything coming from the captain  taliesin like what i dont really  travis well i dont know you seem to make these strange comments about /none/ how people feel and stuff  id have thought maybe you were like a mindreader  taliesin i was really just listening for that word because i wanted to play the speak along  game i wasnt really paying that much attention im so sorry i got a little distracted in there  that was really fun though  laura yeah it was a fun game  sam yeah it was  travis lets pay attention next time shall we cool  sam fjord if i may im sorry captain tusktooth if i may when we find this ukotoa  /none/ laura and taliesin whispering ukotoa  sam you have this thing inside of you is your goal to get rid of the thing inside of you to  commune with it to bow down and serve this monster  laura or are you going to become like a god or something  liam i feel like we are learning a lot about you right now and not from you are we alone  laughter  matt its funny you ask that question  sam i thought we were in our chamber  matt no youre in your chamber youre alone /none/ but you dont know how thick these walls are you  know there are people stationed right outside of your door  laura can i look around and see if theres any peepholes in the walls or anything  matt make an investigation check  travis oh good call  laura 12  matt you take a moment to glance around the space and feel along the walls you dont notice  anything that catches your attention  laura okay  liam i pull out the wire in view of everyone and cover my hands and say to fjord is /none/ there anything  that you maybe want to tell us about that you havent already  travis i mean  sam wait before you talk out loud cant you use your magic to make some sound or something to  muffle whats happening in here  laura um no  sam okay good go on  laura wait wait caleb what if you use your antisink bubble  liam well i would have to ask the dm i dont know about this that bubble i dont know if it  is soundproof at all because i just got that spell /none/  matt let me check i do not believe it is  liam i dont think it is  matt but i will check real fast while im here  laura i can use thaumaturgy to make it sound like theres ominous whispers all around  sam yeah that would thats good  taliesin actually if we both do that maybe its like going to be white noise  sam yeah itll be like a white noise machine  laura can we create white noise  marisha yeah white noise  sam yasha can fall asleep  matt it prevents /none/ creatures from entering and exiting outside of the ones that you choose but  it does not shift alter or stop any sound passage  liam yeah i would  marisha that means everyone heard beau and keg bone is what youre saying  cheering  travis well if  liam well you were upstairs so only if youre screamers  laura well some of us actually saw it  marisha its a good night  travis no shame  marisha no shame no regrets  laura can caduceus and i use our thaumaturgy to make ominous whispers all around /dung/ us so that its  like white noise so that we can whisper inside  matt sure  laura yeah thats what we do constantly well trade off so its like  taliesin and laura whispering krakatoa krakatoa  taliesin all my whispers are just saying that in different pitches  matt right okay ill allow it  laura all of mine are just playing the penis game  travis ill tell you what i know and thats that i see visions sometimes its been a long time  since theres a giant eye and i hear a voice speaking /none/ to me i dont know where it comes from  and i dont know where i am if its the past or my future but i feel like it happened that night  when the ship exploded and before i found myself on the shore with the sword i feel like those  things are all connected when i saw the sphere it reminded me of that eye  liam you have im speaking very quietly amongst jesters whispers  travis i am too  laura whispering penis penis penis  liam you have been having  laura penis  /none/ taliesin krakotoa krakotoa krakotoa  liam this is an ongoing dream that you have been having  travis i wouldnt say ongoing its happened like three or four times  matt yeah sure  travis sure three or four times three  liam three or four times you have had a dream with a thing that has a giant eye like the one on  your sword and like the inner motifs of this womans office  travis yeah  marisha you know there were several eyes in that ouroboros  travis right  marisha i wonder if thats how /none/ many other chosen ones there are  laura oh my god what if theres that many other eyeballs you can like swallow them all and then  you become like ultra powerful  travis or i can summon the dragon  cheering  laura i think you get a wish  travis i have been having them but i wouldnt think to comment on them because theyre just  fucking dreams  liam yeah okay were you able to summon a scary transparent tentacles before that explosion on the  boat and those dreams happened  travis no  marisha /none/ yeah that shit aint dreams man  liam were you vomiting seawater before you had those dreams or making a sword come out of the  palm of your hand before that explosion  travis not to my knowledge  liam no judgements here but is it safe to say that you have been undersharing with us  marisha i dont know hes told us all that before  liam every single thing  marisha yeah i think so  travis did i no youre right i have undershared and im sorry i just didnt think  it was relevant /none/  liam seems pretty relevant  travis well yeah fucking now  marisha well look i mean jester gets visited by the traveler  laura i do  marisha yasha has thunder  ashley dreams and visions i do  marisha she has dreams and visions maybe you guys are just special or whatever the fuck they  tell people  laughter  travis yeah yasha i mean do you vomit after you talk to the thunder  ashley i only vomit if something upsets my stomach so i dont wake up from dreams or visions  vomiting anything  /none/ travis me neither it happened one time so  ashley okay  travis just the once  marisha right  travis look i feel like if we can get on land at least and some sort of landing party well  have a better shot nott youre terrified of the water i mean were on unfriendly ground i dont  mind trying to slip away or forcing our way out of this situation but i sure would like a resolution  and at least a better place to stage some sort of action than on an enemy boat  sam /none/ what the  travis ship ship its a ship  taliesin how many how many how many  travis and talisin three masts  travis mizzenmast mainmast foremast i got it ha ha ha  cheering  sam but our goal right now is not to run away right  liam yes this was my next question i personally was thinking about getting the hell  out of here but  sam were here for fjord  liam we are here for you and you want to understand what is happening to you  travis no i just

the point  cheering  marisha i mean look  sam as long as i dont have to swim  marisha avantika seems like shes had this gift and these visions for quite some time maybe you  could learn /none/ something about yourself talk to her a little bit  laura gasping does that mean she swallowed one too i mean like really though does she have one  inside of her  sam she might  laura gasping if theres

taliesin no thats  laura and piercing eyes  taliesin this is not an intimidatable person i mean you can just look  marisha i disagree  taliesin i think from what little i gleaned i imagine vanity /none/ is the way to play this one  travis vanity you say  taliesin yeah i mean some people just want to talk and i think she just wants somebody to talk  to thats the vibe i get  cheering  marisha yeah we did say we were going to get better at that  sam or we can murder everyone on the boat  laughter  sam ah  travis were trying to do less of that  sam okay  liam yeah this is too simplistic it

probably told you that i would be right back i had to go to the little girls room  matt all right for one thing as soon as you because theres only one exit to the chamber  sam huh  matt theres only one exit to the chamber the door that leads out as soon as you door  creaking you see the guard is posted right there you feel pretty quiet and youre pretty you feel  that youre in the groove where you can get through pretty quickly without /none/ being seen but you  have to get past that one guard that you can see stationed right outside of the door  sam okay ill use a spell then ill take a little bit of i think its a cloth fleece as  caleb taught me and ill create a silent image down the hall can i peek out the door a little bit  matt ill say because of your stealth check yes you very carefully nudge the door open enough to  get like an inch of viewing space between that both reveals the guard and the /none/ hallway further down  sam ill make it look like cosko is walking by the hall then walks back  matt okay  sam back again  liam is it a guy in like a costco tshirt  sam yeah  travis amazing  matt keeping a tally  travis uhhuh  sam well were in new york i dont know if they have costco sams club  marisha thats good  matt you create the image of him walking back and forth the guard notices spluttering pats  another guard that you dont see on the upper side of /none/ the door guards like is cosko back go get  the captain the other guy goes and walks away and the other guy stands there nervously looking  back and forth jamedi  sam ill have cosko moonwalk across the hall  matt jamedi jamedi he goes and starts walking in that direction  sam okay ill make my run away my getaway trilling  matt okay you get by you get outside of the door are you running to the right or the left  sam left  matt you run to the left you go running down the /none/ hallway and youre now not that far behind the  other guard who was rushing off and heading up a small set of stairs that leads up to the captains  quarters you remember this before youre actually heading away from the cargo hold this way  now youre heading up  sam oh i dont want to do that  matt yeah  sam ill turn around and go the other way  matt okay you go the other direction and the guy whos now walked up towards cosko towards  jamedi is now rushing up to it and /none/ goes and is talking to him like sir hello  sam ill have cosko is there a stairs or a ladder near here  matt make a perception check  sam okay oh thats a four  matt youre not sure you see a couple of chairs a card table thats currently empty you can see  the hallway continues past where this illusion is happening  sam card table thats currently empty coskos going to sit down at that card table and start  dealing two hands  laughter  travis oh my god  matt as he does /none/ so the guys like jamedi the captain will be right here what just looks  really confused  sam is there a way to slip by  matt your stealth check yes there is you dart past  sam slip by the back yeah  matt right at that moment you look over your shoulder and you can see the captain is now  heading down the hallway in your direction  sam okay ill make the effect disappear  matt he goes what i dont  sam oh but ill leave the effect of the cards still there  /none/ cheering  matt you run to the end of the hallway you see those stairs ascending down into the cargo hold  below and you hear over your shoulder and where is he no but captain he was right look at  the cards  sam poof  matt you hear the argument and the guy desperately trying to explain what he just saw as  you disappear down into the cargo hold below  sam im going to look around for boxes and interesting stuff bullets black powder any books  liam also in your ear very quiet you /none/ hear oh hey is everything okay going well  sam ah yeah just going number two its going to be a while that hardtack is hard coming out too  matt on the way down the stairs there is another floor that is the gun deck that you do pass by  and you can see the back end of these large cannons that are all situated theyre all angled  up a little bit but there are these doors that lead outward there are a number of cannon balls  and some bits of black powder in small barrels /none/ set up in that region if you can continue down to the  sam sure keep going looking for interesting stuff  matt you head down to the cargo hold and you see one source of lantern light there is one of the  various deckhands is down below keeping watch has a single oil lantern on a crate it is this  small handheld jug of some sort of you assume a liquor and hes sipping from it leaning back and  stretching just keeping an eye out  sam i will use mage hand and hes just got /dung/ the one lantern down there  matt currently yeah  sam i will use mage hand to try to snuff out the flame  matt easy enough to do whoosh goes dark what  sam ill keep going using darkvision to look around and see things  matt okay so you start making your way around as you do you start seeing sparks of a flint  sam oh hes trying to light it again  matt hes trying to relight the lantern hes like ooh fucking shit stupid little lantern  make an investigation check if you wanted to /none/ look into the cargo hold  sam all right investigation 22  laura ooh  matt how thorough do you want this search to be because itll take you a while to go through the  entire cargo hold  sam looking for interesting boxes i dont want to spend more than five minutes down here if possible  matt okay youll probably have to snuff the lantern one more time and really frustrate the  hell out of him  sam sure maybe i can can i grab it out of his hand  matt the flint  sam /none/ or the lantern  matt yeah  sam make him drop it  matt okay all right he lights the lantern holds it up and you knock it out of his hand  sam yeah  matt hold on a second i got to make a roll here  travis we all go down in a blaze of glory  matt theres a lot of gunpowder on this ship  sam well they shouldnt be using candles then  matt yeah youre fine  travis you fucking fuck  matt the lantern hits the ground and tips over and a /none/ little bit of oil spills out but it doesnt  like scatter and ignite hes like shit and he quickly goes and picks it back up again while  youre investigating the first couple crates you can get to without making any sort of noise that  gets his attention you can tell you lift up the top ones the first one you come to is filled with hardtack  sam ugh  matt the second one you come to a smell gets your attention immediately and you lift it up  and it does have a similar smell to /none/ that gunpowder type material that you encountered on that pistol  sam are they in bags pouches boxes is it just loose  matt you see small kegs that are currently closed off  sam ill take a keg  matt okay its about that big  sam yep  matt youre going to pull it out you got one  sam okay next box  matt okay hes now picked up the lantern again because youve looked through two crates now  sam okay shit ill use that mage hand again this time ill unbuckle his belt  matt /none/ hes clutching that lantern with a death grip now and is now scanning the room and  suddenly his pants whoosh to the ground hes like whoa shit and hes reaching down with  the other hand trying to pull it up and hes got like the lantern in one hand his hand on the  outside of the pants in the other hes tripping a bit and bumps into one of the crates you manage  to get to a third crate you open it up and look inside and it looks like its a bunch of coiled  /none/ rope its a lot of repair materials for the ship theres a thick tarlike substance its probably  used for some form of repairs  sam okay well can i get to one more box  matt okay he gets his pants up  sam okay  matt hes now in the process of walking through the room is there anything else youre going to do  sam ooh i have things i have things i have some shards of shiny pottery i

shatter the guys like who goes there  grunting he goes walking in that direction you get one final crate that you get to you pull it  open looking inside it looks to be im sorry there isnt a whole lot more to find but most of  the cargo here is food you find a lot of an older set of fruit maybe various things that were  brought from their last destination the /none/ smell immediately hits you of like fermenting orange  and other types of various sweet or at least now sweet and fermented fruit  sam yeah ill grab some of that too  matt okay you quickly fill your pockets its squishy to the touch when they put it in there  it squish on the inside you feel it the cold wetness of it spilling against your shirt you  get some pockets filled with fermented fruit  sam okay so i got an armful of gunpowder  matt yep  sam armful of rotting fruit  matt yeah /none/  sam thats a success  cheering  matt you make your way back  sam im going to head back yeah  matt okay make another stealth check

 matt you make your way back while this is happening you guys can hear the argument outside  from the other guards and the captain /none/ lambasting them for pulling her out of her quarters for

admit i too am very encouraged to find someone that seems to have gone through  the same sort of visions and trials that i have you said its been a long time since youve met  another chosen are you saying youve met previous i found myself feeling i was the only  one that was experiencing this vision  sam coughing i thought you were going to say something else  matt she leans her /none/ shoulder against the doorway looking over at your eyes distantly reaching for  memories and goes there has been one other its been many years this came to me through a  series of unexpected you see her searching for the right words and says ive always considered  myself a very lucky person at first i thought this was a terrible portent when this beautiful  ukotoa spoke to me it was a purpose that nobody else in darktow was going on and with that i  began to gather my crew it took a while but each of /none/ them began to believe as well all of them  support and when this is done the blessing is high nay he is unstoppable behind me as  i am on the sea  travis the blessing you say i havent heard speak blessing ive heard words of encouragement  and your crew believes as you do  matt they have now yes ive read the books ive looked up about the kinau ive learned of  the history as they once were the masters of the lucidian ocean so too will be i so too can be us  /none/ travis i look forward to this very very much i noticed as we were leaving your quarters that  beautiful iron piece above your doorway a snake circling back upon itself the eye in the middle  but it seemed there were small eyes all around the body of the snake  matt they say that ukotoa is an infinite length entity a serpent that entwines the entirety of  the water that is but eyes across its body to see what else it must conquer  travis that sounds  matt beautiful  travis exactly the word i was /none/ searching for speaking of beautiful  sam oh  cheering  travis i was so taken by that marking that tattoo you had i was wondering if you might show  it to me again  liam i think theyre about to get naked  matt make a persuasion check  travis im uncomfortable with whats happening natural 20  cheering  matt she tugs down the scarf to reveal the tattoo without breaking eye contact and goes ill do  you one better  cheering  sam zip  matt removes the glove off of her right hand and /none/ in the palm you see a familiar yellow eye emerging  from the center this is the blessing it leaves the first stage i have been chosen to be one step  to his unsealing  travis like a fucking eye or a tattoo of an eye  matt make a perception check  travis 16  matt you hope its a tattoo but the way the candle light hits it looks smooth and somewhat glassy  travis oh god fuck thats getting weird  cheering  travisthats some pan labyrinths bullshit going on clears throat my my  laughter /none/  travis fuck it i feel now you and i are more connected than i couldve ever imagined ill  summon the sword  cheering  matt with a flash and a scattering of ocean water across the far wall of the chamber the falchion  emerges in your grasp  applause  matt its what its always done  cheering  marisha wait which sword what do you mean sword  liam caleb cant hear any of this but in the middle of the room he says it is getting very  kinky in that room  marisha goddamn /none/ it  laura jesters just pacing back and forth  matt she immediately takes a step forward like holding her palm forward still not even looking  at you just looking at the sword and specifically focusing on the eye in the center of the hilt  shes speechless for a moment you hear her breathe in suddenly perhaps it was destiny  travis perhaps it was do you know what will happen if we  laura suggestive clicking sorry im sorry im sorry  laughter  travis do you know what will happen if we take this sphere to /none/ the place of its choosing have you  seen whats unleashed or have you only heard  matt ive only heard as far as i know when these survivors of zehir this long sealed god  grew jealous that they are the ones who put ukotoa away below the ocean  sam whispering ukotoa  matt if im correct and this is one of the original temples then i think we can bring him back  travis i admit i find myself very curious  matt this is but one there are three i know of  travis three temples /none/  matt three temples across the swavain islands  travis all of the same construct all looking for the same what do you call it  matt i dont know if theres a name for it i just call it the sphere the eye  travis same  matt ill be honest the dreams that i have its mostly just feeling and an occasional word  like hes being held back i feel that if we can one by one release him from these bindings he  can be more direct with us be more direct with his blessing he /none/ will bequeath the sea unto us  travis my god the sea  laughter  travis what does the eye say to you anything you remember  matt tells me to to watch to learn  laura grunting  travis to consume

travis oh fuck  cheering  matt just places her fingers on the hilt of the sword where the eye is then youll need your rest  travis indeed  marisha mlady  travis we will all  laughter  travis i will

perception check  liam okay  taliesin roll well  liam just a ten  matt okay you watch as she takes her glove and puts it back on looking at her palm as she does  looks out over the ocean and steps out to the railing where she has to move away to get out of  the visual perspective and spends a minute or so looking over the water then turns back goes and  closes the door walks over to underneath the main doorway where that shrine is she pulls /none/ a stool  up to stand up to about eye level to where the shrine is then she pulls her glove off once more  makes a small cut on her finger and drops a few pieces of blood onto the small iron shrine its  maybe about that big and then puts the glove back on mumbles a few words beneath her breath though  frumpkin might not able to see from this perspective then goes ahead and snuffs the candles  liam so she did some arcane shit did she also look very hot and bothered  matt /none/ with that perception roll id say you dont know  travis yeah but you know  matt i dont know man not for me im real bad at seeing that  marisha so eyeball hand you showed her yours  travis yep  marisha was she i dont know did she say anything else about  travis yeah no youre right she actually said there was one before that was also chosen  laura what happened to him  sam yeah when you asked what happened to him what did she say  laughter  travis where was that fucking /none/ pigeon we didnt get to that part but i feel like because i saw  my former captain vandren with the same sphere that he might be the one that she was talking about  laura gasping wait wait wait wait  all wait  laura what if vandren had a different sphere what if there was like a whole bunch of them  travis theres a chance she said that this temple that were about to visit was one of three  laura theres three what if vandren and you and she have them  marisha yeah and theyre /none/ all keys to the temple  laura what if vandren had one and then she knew it and she killed vandren and now shes going to  kill you and shes going to try to take your orb  travis jester i dont think she killed vandren he was on the ship when it exploded i dont even  laura how did the ship explode fjord  sam she has a ship with cannons  marisha also nott said that theres like a fuck ton of gunpowder under the ship so  travis no i understand sabian my crewmate he /none/ went down and sabotaged the ship he set off an  explosion that has to be what happened  laura who was sabian working for avantika  marisha if she has a sphere and can talk to the serpent gods im assuming she has some sort of  magical powers like you have magical powers she has cool robes and is wearing an amulet that just  screams magic  liam yeah well so after you you know made the flirt talk that i was watching  marisha the flirt talk  liam oh they were both pouring it on /none/ pretty thick  travis well i think we were being pretty respectful  liam thats a subjective thing my friend anyway she is very interested in you and after  you left her room i watched a little bit longer and she did some cutting she dropped a little bit  of her blood on a miniature altar or something do you do this  travis i do not altar the little iron piece above her doorway  liam yeah she stood on a stool and she did a little  travis i saw that on the way out i /none/ dont do anything like that i dont know what that would  ashley i have a question she said that there was somebody that was before her  travis she did she said there was one other chosen besides herself and now me  ashley did you look at her other did you get a closer look  travis i did the tattoo  ashley did that look familiar  travis have i seen that anywhere else  matt to you i would say no not in the time that you saw it  travis didnt molly have  cheering /none/  travis did he have any tattoos that had eyes in them like the peacock feathers  ashley he had nine of them  taliesin shed know  sam nine  laughter  taliesin this one  sam nine eyes  marisha i mean he also had that allseeing eye on his back right  travis what  laughter  laura i mean you roomed with him fjord didnt you see him naked  taliesin yes  cheering  travis sure  taliesin dont be a bad roommate he was a bad roommate dont be a bad roommate  laughter /none/  ashley and travis could be nothing  marisha i mean eyeballs we all have two theres a lot of eyeballs around just saying  things have eyes  travis yeah right  marisha just trying to be skeptical  travis yeah i know  marisha yeah  travis she said we should all get some rest i feel like weve earned some trust i feel like  well be in good hands i dont know if i entirely trust her but i do feel like she is motivated to  see where this leads  liam thats one way /none/ of putting it ja  travis i will say she seems a bit on the fanatical end she spoke of acquiring powers that  i cant even begin to comprehend control over the oceans and seas  laura whoa  travis or other follow  laura what it sounds cool  sam thats a lot yeah thats a big power  travis but doesnt that sound like too much  taliesin i mean what would you even do with that whats the point of it really  sam well i know what i would do with it  taliesin what /none/ would you do with it  sam get rid of the seas  laughter  sam tell them to go away and go somewhere else and have more land  taliesin see and that just a point of a higher motivation for something i mean theres got to  be a step two  liam she seemed very maniacal is the word that i would choose she seemed very driven  marisha deuce has a point theres got to be a goal at the end of all those powers right  sam well well find out tomorrow i suppose  /none/ travis we will and in the meantime i would suggest that we acted like we are as interested  and motivated to see this through as her followers otherwise i think well stick out  marisha did she say anything else about what she wants  travis no  liam i mean it sounded like she wanted power and a lot of it  travis she does unleashing things that are too terrible to talk about but you can use your imagination  sam was that a dick joke  laughter  travis nope  marisha jessie are you all /none/ right  laura i mean  marisha youve just had this like really angry face in the corner for a little bit  laura oh i dont know what youre talking about im just sitting there with my sketchbook drawing  captain avantika with daggers sticking into her like a voodoo doll  travis youre not drawing like this youre drawing like this  laura yeah aggressively i dont know what youre talking about im happy over here  marisha no it looks like the third pencil youve broken so i just wanted to just curious fourth  liam fjord /none/ if we venture into this sticky wicket do you share even in a small way similar  desires as this woman do you want to control the sea  travis its the first time ive heard of it i mean it sounds incredible but i cant even begin  to fathom what that would be like that responsibility i dont know who i would be if i  could wield something like that  liam well you are grappling with a great deal of power we have watched you do it are you trying  to understand this thing better /none/ be free of it master it  travis understand it would be a start  taliesin you cant know what to do until you understand it i mean thats step one and once  you understand it well try and help you make a reasonable decision about what to do with it  laura what if the closer you get to it the weirder you get what if you start feeling those  urges like she has and stuff  travis what urges  laura like the powerful urges  marisha thats a good question  travis well ive asked /none/ beau to check me and ill check her on areas of aggression if i start  controlling the oceans and shit maybe well talk about it  laura okay  travis until then i can only tell you i only want to know more about this and find out about  what happened to my friend thats as far as im thinking  sam lets do that then  taliesin im into it  marisha lets get some rest  travis try to sleep  matt you guys all get yourselves to sleep  liam yeah i place the elf /none/ owl back on beauregards shoulder and go to sleep  matt okay as you guys all find yourself to rest is your mic not working  sam what  ashley oh no its not working  laura no its not  sam weve lost ashley  travis share with tal  matt you share with taliesin  laura wait  sam no its gone  matt well share thats fine so as you all go to sleep finding yourself into an evening of rest fjord  travis no goddamn it  sam should we leave the stage do we need /none/ to leave the stage  travis no  matt you dont need to that was more helpful earlier in the campaign when everything was a  super mystery you spilled all the beans recently so its fine you walk in darkness your eyes  trained on a barely visible horizon of faded blue the lightless midnight horizon that breaks this  endless void the ground is soft beneath your feet and your slow gait bounces slightly with each  step like time is crawling in this buoyant space you look down at yourself obscured by a shadow  until a /none/ faint yellow light bursts from your sword the light of a yellow eye now open from the hilt  like a lantern lighting a tangled forest of kelp before you bubbles escape the corner of your  mouth but you breath the waters calmly like a thick vapor learn you search through the mass  of shifting slick sea vines eventually coming upon the base of a staircase going up grow  what do you do  travis i climb those motherfucking stairs  matt as you ascend the cold stone stairs the beam of the eye lighting the way /none/ your passage is  suddenly blocked by something a statue humanoid but featureless provoke  travis ill fire two blasts of eldritch blast at it  matt the statue breaks apart its various shards emerging from the detonation and slowly sinking in  what is now the thick waters around you as the head tumbles past the light of the edge of your  sword the face is recognizable in a flash sabian you push beyond continuing to ascend the  stairs you come upon another statue larger and looming more than the last what do you do  travis /dung/ witch bolt right to its chest  matt as the darkened energy arcs from the hilt of your blade hitting it you watch as the cracks  spider up the stone before it detonates into hundreds of shards of dark stone you see half of  the face slowly hit and clatter onto the stone before falling off to the side vandren do you  continue up  travis the stairs are they staying the same is there anything at the foot of the statue after  they break apart  matt looking down the statue itself is now immaterial /dung/ youve entirely annihilated it and you  glance over the side and what few shards still remain slowly drift beyond your view into the  dark abyss below  travis ill move forward  matt continuing to ascend these steps one by one they grow more and more narrow you think you see  an approaching surface of some kind youre clear of the water suddenly breaking the surface and  youre standing in a dark stone chamber youve managed to get all the way up standing within the  ankle high water in the middle of the stone chamber /none/ and you watch as all the liquid begins to  drain until theres no more water around you revealing in the center of this chamber an  intricate circle in the ground maybe two feet across beautiful ancient craftsmanship detailed  to depict a serpent body coiled carved eyes emerging from the creatures body every few  inches the center of the water is a circle of water like a well watching what do you do  travis ill summon the sword and hold the eye facing the circle  matt as you hold the blade up you see the /none/ light hits the water and is absorbed by it you dont  see anything beneath it it seems to be just a void that eats the light  travis void that eats the light can i walk into the center of the circle  matt you step into it  travis well i definitely do now  matt well is that what you want to do  travis yeah  matt okay you step into the circle its only a few inches deep of water and your feet feel the  bottom it is shallow youre now standing above it /none/ its only about two feet across so its  basically you standing over the small pool  travis is there a ceiling are there walls are there statues in this space  matt looking around you you can see stone walls and you could see a ceiling above you it is  almost plain featureless room aside from the very edges of stone stacked upon itself  travis watching can i look into the eye of the sword do i see anything  matt you look towards the hilt and the eye stares back at you the light temporarily blinding /none/ you  for a moment as you adjust  travis what the fuck can i try and take the edge of the blade and press it into the floor  matt you press the blade in through the water and it hits the stone  travis jesus english accent i dont know what you want from me  matt no response then you hear once more watch  travis ive stared at the eye fuck i have no idea  matt make a perception check  travis ooh 19  matt the handle of the sword is somewhat slick in /none/ your grasp from the water youve been traveling  from before and you feel the blade almost trying to turn in your grasp turning the eye away from you  travis ill let it go where its leading and point it towards the floor  matt it slowly finds its way resting facing down towards the pool  travis okay  laura put your face in it  travis sure can i put my face in the water  cheering  sam pigeon cooing  matt you place your face down into the water and as opposed to the stone /none/ surface youve seen there  it is this vacuous black void there you see in a sudden instant the eye opens up before you the  bright yellow light enveloping you suddenly theres searing heat and you pull back out of the  pool and the entire chamber is filled with blazing hot steam it hurts at first but then it begins  to feel nice this burning sensation crawling across your body going instead from pain to a  surge of strength of control of purpose the voice again says reward as you look up around  you the /none/ stone falls away and on the distance you can see that horizon once more now an endless  ocean you can see the faint ripples of waves across a sourceless bit of moonlight there you  see dozens of ships coming towards you what do you do  travis can i look behind myself real fast  matt you turn behind you and it is just darkness inky infinite  travis a shit load of ships coming towards me cool are there any pigeons in this dream  laughter  matt make a perception check  travis 16  matt /none/ no  travis can i reach my hand out and try and control the ships  matt as you concentrate looking towards the right of you where it looks like four or five  vessels are in a localized portion of this black endless ocean as you concentrate you see the  water begin to boil beneath them  travis yeah were going to go ahead and grab whatever the fuck that is and pull it up  matt you watch as the ocean fires up like a spire a pillar of solid ocean water the ships  are scattered /none/ in different directions as it slams them down once more scattering them into  thousands of pieces of splintered wood  travis can i take both hands and do a coup de grace two big crashing over the top  matt the center of the ocean parts giving this slight vacuum this dualsided abyssal crevice in  the center of the ocean on the opposite ends of where your hands rise you watch the waves rise up  and in one fell sweep two solid crystalline walls of water slam together and then even out as the  ripples subside /none/ all you can see are the thousands and thousands of glittering shards of what once  were that armada  marisha moses shit  travis dont wake up dont wake up  matt reward and you wake up  applause  sam wow another dream with seamen scattered everywhere  laughter  matt its somehow worse with that outfit  travis laughing yes  sam thats my people  matt as the rest of you come to consciousness in the morning fjord seems to be sleeping in a  little bit before suddenly shooting up with a gasp  laura /none/ did you have a dream  travis english accent what regular voice no no i didnt  marisha youre drenched in sweat just throwing that out there  travis yeah  marisha real soggy  travis yeah no we were fighting crazy beasts and monsters and all this talk of serpents i feel  laura fjord are you lying  matt make an insight check make a deception check  liam also why did you talk so funny for a moment  laura ah come on  travis 16  laura i rolled a fucking one  matt i mean /none/ he seems perturbed by something but you dont disbelieve him caduceus however  cheering  taliesin i just woke up i dont actually know whats going on right now  matt fair enough oh but looking at passive insight for beauregard and caleb  liam you sounded like you had a different accent for a moment there fjord  marisha im not going to say anything  travis i dont know im so used to copying people i get all sorts of stuff mixed up in my head  marisha lets go  taliesin did i miss something i dont /none/  ashley you sure you dont want to talk about it  travis talk about the dream  ashley yeah  travis i mean its just a dream whats there to talk about  sam nobody likes to hear other peoples dreams its really boring  travis first thing in the morning youre like sarcasm oh i know it was amazing tell me more   sam yeah thats true  laughter  travis i mean wait you guys didnt have any dreams of a similar nature did you  marisha no we didnt  taliesin what kind of dreams /none/ of a similar nature  laura i had this dream that i was walking in this field and then there was this banana tree right in  front of me and i climbed it and i got some bananas and then they turned bad really fast  sam ooh  laura yeah so i think it had something to do with that  sam yeah  laura then the grass was purple and then this guy came up to me and he was like whoa i just  heard but then his face turned into an eagle and he flew /none/ away what do you think it means  sam you should write those down theyre really important  laura okay  marisha look as someone who still doesnt have any type of dreams whatevers going on its not  normal i just want to point that out  sam she just wants you to know that youre not normal should we go off to our adventure now  matt you guys head your way up to the deck  liam except that i pull beau back while everyone proceeds upstairs  matt all right  laughter  liam speaking as /none/ a massive liar i think he is lying to us a little bit  marisha look we can know just like i know about your shit we can know about fjords shit and we  can just keep that on the down low right im interested in knowing about peoples shit not  exposing it  liam sure one eye open  marisha one eye open  liam i dont think he knows what he wants yet  marisha oh and you think you do you the authority on knowing what other people want  liam no im the authority /none/ on knowing what i want beauregard  marisha yeah me neither  laughter  liam he spoke with a different accent for a split second  marisha weve heard fjord speak with a lot of different accents  liam yeah to a purpose not when he is waking up instantly  marisha he clearly had some sort of fucking dream we know that  liam okay  marisha hell tell us when he wants to tell us all right  liam i walk upstairs  matt okay you guys have made it to the deck its early morning the suns /none/ only really been up  maybe an hour or so theres still a mist across the ocean and you can see the distance where the  reefs encapsulate the surrounding area of this island the mist is so heavy that you cannot see  beyond other than a few other signs that you recall when you first passed through that reef  looking off the way of the shore you can see that the mistake is currently grounded and looks like  theres a small crew trying to do repairs youre not quite sure to what extent and how long /dung/ itll  take but the ship seems to be at least the time being out of commission  taliesin hopefully we can fix our mistake at some point thatd be nice thank you sorry carry on  matt you can see vera captain avantika and a few of the crew members are currently in a  conversation with a man that you hadnt seen before you see a gentleman completely bald head  very dark brown skin a heavy leather coat with like a few belts or bandoliers attached to it he  has a satchel on the side and /none/ a few blades that are sheathed and hanging he looks like an  individual whos ready to travel in case anything happens hes prepared maybe a little cleaner  than caleb but definitely a little ramshackle in appearance theyre in the middle of a  conversation and as soon as you approach the deck the captain notices your presence and goes good  morning come it seems that our destined journey is just around the corner please the mighty  nein may i introduce you to a good friend who is hoping to be arrived soon jamedi jamedi this is /none/  the mighty nein he turns to you all and goes it is a pleasure to meet you all the captain has  told me that we are to be traveling to the island together yes  laura oui  taliesin we  travis that is correct it is a pleasure to meet you as well  matt i will tell you it is very dangerous bring what you think is necessary the island itself is  indeed cursed for the creatures that call it home  marisha well if youve explored it why dont you tell us whats necessary /none/ to bring  matt i was about to give you that before you so rudely interrupted me first thing in the morning  marisha okay well then go on what  matt he gives like a look to the captain the captains like there are a number of lizard folk  that patrol the outskirts of the island calling it home hunting i could not quite suss out the  source of where their society is but they seem to live on the exterior of the island further in i  did find the temple but it is not abandoned /none/ there are villages of snake men that surround this  stone shrine their mutations are various and strange i managed to avoid being seen and i made  it to the initial interior chambers of this village of this stone obelisk of a temple but i  surmised it would be best if i went further with aid of those who were capable of defending  themselves so i came back i do have a path that i think is of how you say least resistance so i  would say bring what is important to perhaps deal with lizards /none/ and snakes  laura these lizard and snake people  matt yes  laura did they seem nice  matt no  laura did you see any snake and lizard women and children  matt there were various of both sexes and perhaps between i do not know the full idea of these  creatures physiology  laura all right  sam thats all you wanted to know just  laura i just wanted to know if they had happy families thats all you know  taliesin did they have feet or  matt i did not look too closely /none/ into the  laura but what do they do for fun  sam jester were probably going to kill all of these people maybe we dont care what they do  matt i would not suggest trying to kill them all trying to avoid them expediency using the  shadows and travel without being found i think is our best bet at survival  travis i would agree i think theyre quite territorial we would do best to remain unseen  laura have you run into these people before fjord  travis no i havent im  marisha hmm  /none/ laura have you had dreams about them or something  travis no what was your comment  marisha is this not ringing a bell for any of yalls snake people temples the naga we  already fought them done this once before think thats where we got the little sphere thing that  went in fjords thing had a little circle with like a pool in it and you could see shit  travis they were like fish people not like snake people  taliesin i dont remember any of this  laura yeah they were like  laughter  /none/ marisha all right but hear me out because we fought those people in the swamp they were the  merrow people right maybe theyre still worshiping the same type of serpentine deity  travis i see where youre going  marisha a lot of different people takes a lot of different types  laura what if we were already in one of the temples that were looking for you said there  were three right  marisha thats what i just said  laura what if that was a temple right  marisha yeah  laura thats what you were /none/ going for  marisha thats what i was totally going for  laura i understand  marisha thank you  taliesin i thought it was like metaphorical that we were still in the temple and just having some  elaborate like a dream of life and weve all been in this temple all along and i mean that would  have been really cool although really convoluted the more im thinking about it doesnt make any sense  sam before we go stealthing in fjord do you want to look at the dodecahedron or anything  would that be good /none/  travis me  sam yeah you youre the  matt the captain goes what is a dodecahedron  travis it is a sigil of our group that is sometimes viewed just to focus ones energy  sam like a pep talk  travis but i dont think i need it im very focused on the fucking job at hand and perhaps  someone needs help with like stealth you know  sam not me  travis oh plus zero all right ill look at it  applause  travis should have looked at that first  matt the captain /none/ claps her hands twice again to get everyones attention vera look after the  ship look after our men their men jamedi lead the way i am excited to see what we uncover  together huh  travis indeed  matt i hope you slept well come to the boats the rope ladders are let over once more you all  descend into these row boats between the two of them most of you can get onto it a little  awkwardly but enough to at least make your way the few hundred feet to the shore you eventually  /none/ come upon the beautiful white beaches of urukaxl you see the occasional shard of driftwood or a  glimmer of a smooth abalone shell scattered amongst the sandy beach the jungle line begins  about 40 feet before you and immediately grows dense and tangled with vines root and various  jungle tropical trees that choke the sky above jamedi turns to the rest of you and goes now you  must be quiet move quickly as the island has many denizens that would find us exotic meats are  we ready  sam oui  matt then come he /none/ begins to lead the way in and captain avantika looks to us this will be  fun yeah  travis should be  matt as you all slowly begin to duck in towards the tree line of the jungle well pick up there  next week  cheering and applause  matt that was fun  taliesin some treasure island shit
