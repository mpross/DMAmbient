/none/ dramatic music  applause  audience member ready for dice violence  matt its too early for dice violence  taliesin oh my god  matt tap tap tap can you hear me through the mic thats the perfect time for the cricket sounds to  go off  taliesin im going to keep making noise  audience member we can hear you  matt you got this  taliesin wait  matt this is not your fault  taliesin we got one up second one is possibly going to be up  matt at worst well just have to /none/ share a mic  taliesin itll be fine  matt no thank you for your patience well be with you in just a second  taliesin you start talking and ill sit over here  matt okay  audience member loot crate  laughter  matt sams not here its not the same that poor man didnt realize what he was doing when he did  his first real loot crate pitch like well this is your job from now on  taliesin im horrified i was originally like im excited ill eventually get to do one i  dont /none/ want to do one any more  matt yeah theres too much to live up to now  taliesin im still inaudible okay fine  matt so good morning everybody how you doing  cheering and applause  matt welcome to our hopefully wellrested sunday at noon critical role panel who had a good night  last night  cheering  matt whos suffering today because of it  cheering  matt you are the true champions  taliesin hey found your badge yay  audience member i got a new one  taliesin even better  matt is that /none/ allura over there  audience member yeah  matt that is amazing  taliesin so much cosplay  matt i love it  taliesin i dont know what happened  matt criticalcostumes for our halloween contest  taliesin critical costumes with an s critical costumes  matt one of the two  taliesin yes  matt well just check them all i dont remember im still groggy so who are you  taliesin hi my name is taliesin jaffe im a voice actor and voice director and somehow a  dungeons  dragons player at this point which has apparently /town/ become a thing i say now in front of  crowds of people it is a unique and exciting opportunity and makes taking lyfts and ubers  around the city even more exciting than it used to be really great its nice to actually see them  get worried you do what no yeah i dont know what that is ah  matt well sometimes it helps end the conversation you dont need in the back of the uber  taliesin another test carry on keep talking  matt my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor from los /none/ angeles we got it  taliesin yeah youre good carry on  matt ive been playing dungeons  dragons most of my young adult and adult life and im damn proud  of it theres other rpgs but dd is kind of my mainstay and somehow this happened we all know  what this means we dont know how this happened  taliesin is there anybody here who got dragged here and has no idea why theyre in this room  laughter  matt all righty so to give you a little heads up on that critical role is a /none/ twitch stream that we  do pretty much every thursday night where me taliesin and a bunch of other nerdyass voice  actors play dungeons  dragons it began as a private game we played for two years in  pathfinder and then geek  sundry approached us because somehow word got around the industry that  there was this voice actor dd game and like you should do it on camera we were like eh  taliesin look at that yeah  matt yay  taliesin its like a brookstone puzzle of wires down here it was so impressive /none/ it was red to  green it was like a mansions of madness minipuzzle down here thats evil thanks man  matt success  audience member yeah tech  applause  audience members chanting tech crew tech crew tech crew  taliesin that should happen at every panel  matt there isnt enough appreciation for the tech crew we were iffy on doing our game oncamera  because it was something that was personal to us and whenever you put anything on the internet  youre ready for the internet to tear it into 14 pieces light it on fire /none/ and laugh at you in your  pile of tears when they told us they were doing a twitch channel and it allowed us to play unedited  for all the rough bumps and mishaps that is an actual dd game then at least that allowed us to  continue what we were doing just adding cameras to the room i think we were happy to find that it  really didnt change the experience too much and were still having fun playing dd once a week in  front of a lot more people  taliesin i was quite /none/ pleased that our mostviewed episode so far has been the one where im mostly  not in it  laughter  taliesin wow all they had to do was get rid of me and suddenly weve got more people watching we  should do that in every episode thats great so sorry  matt angry voice well give you ten bucks here you can kill percy every episode  taliesin were going to make so many likes all the internet likes will be ours well be swimming  in internet likes  matt the whole marketing team crunched the numbers /none/ and you get at least a 25 increase in  viewership every time taliesin is not on screen do it god if that conversation ever happened  thats when were gone  taliesin i was about to say to be fair who would we have that conversation with we are  pretty much left to our own devices mostly its nice they just let us do the show its really sweet  matt at the very beginning they were like hey this shows going well you should do these  things we went  matt and taliesin no  matt /none/ they went what we went well leave they went do your thing its been nice to be  able to hold our ground  taliesin ill say the tech crew and even the production crew at this point were all on the  same ship together at this point its nice  matt everyone involved with the shows production really cool people and we have a good time  taliesin it was a couple of weeks ago when that giant tub of legos came in i was so excited  because i had a guest with me and i wanted /none/ to introduce her to everybody the shows happening  and things are getting ready but half the tech crew are just sitting building legos they wont  even make eye contact just like slowly im like guys are you and just like no this  is what we do now its a fun place to work  matt so thats the gist of critical role you can check it out its a bunch of us just  improvising making weird voices and rolling dice but yes this is primarily a conversation  qa about the show and anything surrounding games /none/ that you have any burning questions you got in  the back of your skull  taliesin i wanted to point out its your only 5th edition game youve ever run isnt it  matt it is actually  taliesin before that was pathfinder before that was 4th edition  matt before that was 35 and every edition previously  taliesin it just suddenly occurred to me this is the only experience youve had running 5th  edition thats so crazy  matt i only have so much free time we started streaming a once a week campaign  taliesin /none/ that changed everything didnt it  matt we used to play once every six to eight weeks maybe mind you wed play for a marathon  session it would be a six to nine hour game when we did play wed just block out an entire saturday  taliesin you want to watch something sad this is my favorite thing to do to hurt him you remember  war machine  matt sadly yeah  taliesin thats a beautiful army youve got its a shame nothing happens with it anymore  matt i know they have a new edition out /none/ too  taliesin thats what i hear i havent finished painting the minis i got for christmas last year  matt no i still have them at my place  laughter  matt mk3 rules look really nice they made some good changes  taliesin ive heard i havent had time  matt me neither thats fine  taliesin maybe after we finally open up that new mansions of madness at some point  matt me and marisha did try that the new mansions of madness edition is really cool  taliesin now im a little envious actually  matt /none/ a fan sent us a copy and prepainted all the minis which is so awesome i think i opened it on  the last periscope we did but it was really cool because ive been wanting to have mansions of  madness with all the minis painted i got half of them done with the older edition and just didnt  have time and so it was really cool that somebody did that  taliesin not that im jealous who did you play with was it key and brittany  matt no it was just me and marisha you can /none/ play with two people  taliesin oh because of the app okay were just talking about games im so sorry okay so the  app works thats good im very excited about that  matt it takes a little bit of a learning curve but once you get there it actually runs pretty  well narratively actually its pretty cool because anyway hi guys youre here too  taliesin we dont get to talk much so this is really nice its so good not to see you on a weekday  matt i know  taliesin should they just raise /none/ their hands  matt lets have some questions how about that you pick first  taliesin lets start on the left in the hoodie you sir  audience member taliesin youre generally very secretive about what you like to do in the game  is that a percy trait or is that a taliesin trait of trying to hide it from the audience and hide it  from your fellow cast members  taliesin ooh thats probably a me god its been so long i finally got to play a character  who wasnt percy for the first time a /none/ few weeks ago and it was such a surprising breath of fresh  air not in a bad way but like oh thats right i can do other things its a me trait  but he really probably brings out more of it than would necessarily be normal because hes not a big  talker i was originally brought into the game to be a bit of a ringer just to make sure there was  somebody in the room who kind of knew the rules kind of knew what was happening and could shove  everybody in the right /none/ direction i got used to playing that way of like i dont want anybody to  see what im working on im going to let everybody else who this is their first dd game  figure this stuff out and im just going to come in at the end if theres anything to sweep up  audience member to follow up what were the rules for percy coming back  taliesin i wont go too deep into them i will say i would have been happy either way we had a  conversation  matt we had discussed your next /none/ possible character  taliesin sitting over really alcoholic beverages dangerous levels of alcohol at laura and travis  house and if he ever goes i have a great character that im really excited for like  really i checked it and its good  matt i already have a way to work it into  the lore and the current story  taliesin the only big rule was because of his most recent experiences with the raven queen any  attempt to invoke a deity was going to be an automatic no just because he has gone in a weird /none/  direction where its become a you cant really be an atheist in dd that just doesnt make any  sense thats just an idiot because a golden flaming fist just came down out of the sky and  crushed a dragon youd be an idiot to be like theres a perfectly reasonable explanation for  that thats a weather balloon obviously he has decided that he wants nothing to do with any of  them any attempt to invoke any of that would have been an automatic no  matt pike got close  taliesin i was watching like /none/ what are you doing girl what are you doing oh okay she  got close to a no you pick one  matt lets go on the im biased hi allura sorry guys you come dressed up as an npc im  going to pick your question first just setting that up for future panels  audience member i know that dming is very time consuming how many hours of preparation does it  take to prepare for a session  matt the question was how many hours does it take to prep for a session as a dm it /none/ varies depending  on whats coming up if the next episode the players are on a very clear track and i know what  the next couple of events theyre probably going to encounter might be then id say it takes about  an hour of prep per hour of gameplay so if its going to be a three to four hour session three to  four hours of preparation as i recently discovered with the episode where they were  bringing you back i call that a nexus episode where there are multiple plot threads out there  and /none/ they can go to any of them and theyre getting to a point in the story where they have to make  that choice of where to go then my life becomes horrible because i have to prepare for many  different opportunities here so that was about a fourhour episode i think i prepped about nine  hours for that one that was also because i didnt know if they were going to go into the abyss to  try and find yenk the goristro in which case i had to prepare a bunch of encounters in the abyss /none/  and made two additional maps for various abyssbased encounters i didnt know if they were  going to go for the dawnmartyr plate so i had stuff for the city of brass prepared including  some encounters that would have worked with the fire plane and the city of brass i also had a  couple other npc encounters i prepped a lot of things so that i wouldnt be completely lost if  they went off the rails which they always do anyway but you try your best as a dm to prepare  taliesin there was just /none/ a giant pile of maps and you after the game were like welp didnt need  any of that did we  matt i made a whole whitestone battle map just in case they decided to say sorry raishan and  then attack which would have gone really poorly for everybody involved it can vary depending on  what point in the story they are but on average its about an equal amount of hours per prep to  gameplay usually good question you pick now  taliesin im going to go to the actually we may get to everybody /none/ eventually so im just going  to start pointing randomly the girl in the red shirt right back there  audience member this is actually a question for matt im going to start dming my first campaign  soon so i wanted to ask you what is some of the best advice you wish you knew when you started dming  taliesin run  matt lets see trying to make this quick i have a bunch of gm tips videos you can go look up  which go into more detailed stuff and i have more of those starting soon /none/ we did a whole new run of  them that go into more of the nuts and bolts a little look under the hood there look for those  soon my recommendation is start small its very easy to get lost in like well i have to create  a world and create all these civilizations and political struggles and screaming start in a  very small location a key location and flesh that out well so the players can play within that  small space and you have a really good idea of what can be done in that /none/ area then as theyre  playing in that space you can then expand a little and expand a little so definitely start small and  then grow out that doesnt work for everybody of course people love the whole world building  aspect and thats totally fine but for people that are starting it can be a little daunting  other than that keep in mind some of the best experiences are when youre trying to facilitate  the players to have incredible moments the very old school gygaxian mindset of dm versus players  i will smash you all /none/ and you will have fun can work as long as you all agree ahead of time that  thats the kind of game you want to play if you want to run tomb of horrors and your friends are  like yeah lets do tomb of horrors then yeah go ahead and do it thats awesome just make sure  that everybodys on the same page on what kind of game you want to run that way you dont end up  getting halfway through and someone is like oh i thought we were going to do like political  /none/ intrigue i made a character based around that now were fighting kobolds and i cant do  anything then you end up leaving out players so have everyone talk beforehand and make sure youre  all on the same page with what kind of game you want to run i think those are two big steps right there  audience member thank you  matt no worries  taliesin yeah thats a really good one i picked one  matt i know im going to go in the way back you sir with the yellow shirt on the left or /none/  pink shirt i cant tell  audience member orange shirt  matt orange shirt oh its in between i got to the bookend colors and eventually came together  audience member ive heard that theres going to be a sourcebook for the critical role setting and  im just wondering is the gunslinger class going to be a full class or just remain an archetype on  the dms guild  matt in regards to the campaign setting which has been an amazing experience of having no free time  taliesin we miss you too  matt im excited /none/ for it ive never written something like this before and i hope you guys  will like it first off im trying to see if i can get permission to put those in the book  because one of the interesting elements of putting things on the dms guild is technically in the  rules youre not allowed to then publish them in other facets its one of those now its on dms  guild it stays on dms guild circumstance so im trying to see if i can find a way to put the blood  hunter and the /none/ gunslinger in there as far as turning it into a full class people can do their  own mods i created it as an archetype because i didnt feel there was necessarily enough there for  the build that i did to make it a full class i could if i had time and i wanted to stretch it  out but it seems to be working fine the way we have it so im probably not going to change it  dramatically from whats been tested and worked in the campaign but there are other people out there  /none/ that have made their own custom firearm gunslinger based classes out there that are actually pretty  awesome i saw a gun mage class that was pretty cool on the dms guild  taliesin someone sent me a really interesting gun cleric  matt gun cleric heal heal youre basically ana  taliesin it was basically fullon an overwatch character  matt so well see i dont think its going to become a full class more than just an archetype  just because thats what we have tested primarily and creating anything new and publishing it  without having any /none/ real extensive test time sounds like a really bad idea to me  taliesin this weeks cluster of stupid is a good sign that its wellbalanced i had a wonderfully  pitiful round which im happy about im glad  matt its a powerful class the grit recycling works really well for crits and deaths it seems  to balance pretty well from being a little bit stronger in some cases and then the drawbacks can  be pretty nasty at times  taliesin two critical fails on the guns is just sad  matt if you play a gunslinger /none/ pull a percy and make sure you have as many john woo weapons on you  as possible  taliesin have a close combat object of some kind something thats the worst  matt indeed good question  taliesin im probably going to try and keep pulling through im going to keep popping around  a bit you sir with the hair yeah you right there yes you know who you are you have the  hair no no no well get there  matt to be fair he also has hair too we all have hair  taliesin i /none/ suppose that is hair sort of  matt well do the guy with the hair and then well do the guy with the hair  audience member he loves that you noticed his hair you have no idea  taliesin i ruined everything  audience member i have a person in one of my games who is going to be eventually playing a  gunslinger and he wanted something to be a bit more supporty so i was wondering just to bounce  this off you guys the idea that like ana tranq darts but you fill them with various /none/ potions  taliesin i dont know if thats something i would do in our game just because although im very  amused by the notion of a paintball gun basically what youre talking about is paintball guns full  of tiger balm where youre just hitting somebody with like what are the odds of that being  knockout gas i love the idea of just like oh it itches what have you done im amused by the  notion of a poison slinger of some kind although it really would be a mess to try and make those  all /none/ the time  matt yeah the cool thing about dd is you can try anything whatever you think fits your  campaign go for it a tranq dart aspect with healing potions could get expensive very quickly  plus nothing sucks more than pumping a 150 200 gold potion into a tranq dart and then missing  also rolling a critical one and hitting the creature instead is like whoa  taliesin what would you think of 1d4 per dart  matt 1d4 healing per dart  taliesin that would be kind of interesting super low health that would be /town/ kind of amusing that you  could actually pump 3d4 into someone but it might go horribly wrong and you might hit an enemy if  you miss  audience member the main thing he joked about was a potion of diminution against mounted combatants  taliesin that would be pretty fun the history nerd in me is like thats very german thats  great somewhere theres a 16thcentury german military historian going yeah it is very  german theres one in the crowd somewhere  matt youd be surprised its like a gunslinger alchemist combo that would be interesting /none/ yeah  try it out why not no reason not to thats why i like dd you can just do anything and itll  probably not work but youll have fun trying  taliesin give it a few rounds youll figure it out its a cool thought though do you want to  pick one  matt i feel like we should get the other guy with the hair  taliesin guy with other hair  audience member i appreciate it as a theater kid myself thank you very much for showing the  respect for the tech because youre /none/ right they dont get the respect  taliesin dont drop the mic theyre expensive  audience if youre a voice actor you dont touch the mic  matt yeah exactly  audience member from your experience both as rpg players dms but also as actors and directors  have those two worked together in such a way where youve found experience from one field is  dedicated to another and back and forth between the two of them  taliesin yes yes very yes yes we should probably repeat the question has working as a  voice actor and working /none/ as a voice director influenced our play and has our play influenced  our work as voice actors and voice directors oh my god yes not just the game were in right now  always i think its one of the reasons why so many of the people we bring on as firsttimers who  are vo people are really good mary elizabeth is just delightful to watch and will is any time  we have vo people on im always just so excited  matt because they realize oh this is kind of what we do for a living /none/ anyway  taliesin theres a lot of the same skill sets i love our friends who come on who arent  necessarily big vo people like i love having chris and im not going to call him other wil  and felicia theyre fun because they know the game and theyre into it and theyre down but i  love watching a new vo actor being like i dont know what im doing  matt then comparably we had rothfuss who had plenty of dd experience but even he came on and  before we started playing he was like /none/ im really intimidated he was nervous in the  kitchen im like you wrote the name of the wind are you serious  once again once he got comfortable with it he made an amazing character that had an amazing  story impact to keyleths personality  taliesin then two months later dropped a bomb on us from space out of nowhere  matt it was so good on the other end of that i will say part of the reason i even became a voice  actor was because of dd i played these games long before i became /none/ a professional actor and as  a dm especially having to create all of these personalities and inhabit them and find variations  to voices to try and mix it up and make the characters interesting became a toolbox of  personalities that i was able to finetune and utilize as a voice actor later in life i can say  with complete honesty probably a third of the characters ive ever performed as an actor had  some sort of root or base as an npc in my high school dd games  taliesin i can go in on /none/ that one too thats very true i hadnt really thought about that any  weird voice i ever do probably started in some game in high school thats nuts  matt so yes both ways  taliesin ill throw to the red coat in the front because im highly entertained by your outfit  audience member good its supposed to be dr ripley  taliesin gasps yes with the hand yes  matt thats fantastic  audience member you guys talk a lot about finding a game that fits you how do you gracefully bow  out of a game /none/ that maybe isnt what you wanted it to be  taliesin blow it up leave nothing  matt nuke it from orbit its the only way to be sure  audience member i have a friend who ordered c4 through a vampire larp so that happened  taliesin ive watched so many of my favorite vampire larps be destroyed by three jerks all it  takes is three jerks to ruin a perfectly functional vampire city i hope hes listening he  knows who he is i had a good thing going  matt theres always the oh guys my /none/ shift changed i cant make the game time sorry have  fun you can do the white lie route because then nobody gets hurt people come in and out of games  all the time because of work  taliesin it is a breakup though you have to accept that somebodys feelings are probably going  to be a little miffed although its possible if youre not having fun theyre not having fun with  you there either so you can always do the roommate thing of i love you as a friend and i  know if we live /none/ together for another month im going to end up hating you so im ending this now  so i can still love seeing you and not want to throttle you this is slowly going to poison  everything i love about you and make me want to strangle you in your sleep  matt if youre not enjoying the game you can always talk to the dm beforehand and let them  know in some cases without communication they might not be aware that theyre running sessions  that arent to your liking or tastes if theyre a good dm /none/ theyll be open to constructive criticism  and be like oh okay i didnt know that that was an aspect that you were missing but you  wanted ill see if i can incorporate that more into the game for you if theyre really  defensive and like well if you dont like my game then step off then step off they just  gave you complete permission to cut away free and dry like all right see you sucker  taliesin not every game is for everybody ive definitely been in games where im not having a  good /none/ time and ive been in games where somebody else is obviously playing a different game and  were like ah man i dig the game youre playing i hope you find it or ill run you  another game ive done that before both directions  matt which is why once again communication before you start playing is so key because that  way everyone has an idea of what theyre looking for and if its the game for them and the dm  knows what kind of players to tailor the story to i would recommend first having a /none/ conversation and  express that because there is a possibility that it could become what youre looking for i would  say give the dm the chance to go ahead and do that if theyre not willing to then just  respectfully bow out and look for a game that more suits your interests because it is your free time  that youre allocating to this dont feel like you should stay out of obligation  taliesin its supposed to be relaxing and therapeutic its not supposed to be what youre  actually talking about in therapy  matt thats /none/ a good way of putting it  taliesin really its supposed to be the den of the therapy not the problem  matt good luck im going to go ahead and pick you sir over on the far side with the zelda shirt  audience member you guys play a lot of general rpgs are there rpgs you prefer playing you play  a lot of dungeons  dragons what would be your next favorite rpg  taliesin its legitimately been two years since ive touched anything else im trying to think  you go  matt i love dd /none/ because its what i grew up with and the 5th edition system is really comfortable  to me it takes a lot of my favorite aspects of older editions and streamlines them where it  allows you to build narrative within the rules a lot easier which as a person who loves narrative  more than anything that to me is a great thing but there are other systems that do it really  well too the fate system is really fun ive played a few games in the fate system as far as  scifi stuff goes i really /none/ enjoy traveler and diaspora those are both really good traveler is  one of the few rpg systems where you can die in character creation  taliesin that and hol man  matt that and hol definitely  taliesin humanoccupied landfill  matt i love the deadlands setting like the weird west its very cool very strange and i love  good western settings anyway so that ones a great one the original system though  complicated i think is the better of the two but if you want more of a simple gameplay style you  can go with /none/ the newer editions which is what we did for our oneshot  taliesin i like risk  laughter  taliesin i like the world of darkness one vampire the masquerade both tabletop and larp  im a big fan of also on their end i liked all their little addendums the mage game is an  enormous amount of fun any attempt to play it in a larp is always a hilarious failure in the best  way changeling werewolf by night the whole run of them is just a great time on that other end  theres some oldschool /none/ stuff teenagers from outer space which is one of the first anime  tabletop games is just dumb its great  matt if you want the other end of dumb anime rpgs you want to go full saiyan or ninja scroll  style insanity exalted is always a good time  taliesin exalted is that end and tfos is more like ranma 12 inuyasha vibe like harem anime stupid  matt exalted is more like i put all my strength into one final attack destroy everything its fun  taliesin cyberpunk and cybergen was always a big one i remember /none/ gurps being fun but i think i was  probably wrong  matt gurps is fun in the same way that paper is fun depending on what you do with paper it can  be a lot of fun or really boring  taliesin its way too awkward its just well im going to make a robot vampire that has the  sword of omens and you can kind of do it  matt speaking of which rifts also is a ridiculous experience in the same vein im not  saying its a good system  taliesin no but boy /none/ you can do anything champions from back in the day was always fun i  was a champions player briefly are there any good superhero rpgs  matt actually the marvel rpg that came out five or six years ago was actually pretty decent  different characters were better at being a solo fighter versus a group fighter versus a team  fighter and you had different dies depending on what you were a specialist with some characters  like wolverine had better damage rolls if they were away from a team  taliesin i could go in for something /none/ like that that would be really cool  matt it was pretty fun  taliesin vampire kind of fakes that you could fake being superheroes in the vampire world all  right more hands im going to pick one dude in the glasses right there im just going to keep rolling  matt there are a couple dudes  taliesin yeah you no im so sorry man im terrible im awful guy in the red shirt  matt then the other guy with the glasses  audience member not counting critical role what for each of you is your most /none/ memorable experience  during a tabletop game  taliesin whoa tabletop or larp or just tabletop  audience member tabletop or larp  taliesin ooh okay i cant talk about that one because i may actually incorporate that into a  game i run later online i have some really good ones that i sadly there was no i cant talk  about that either i would incriminate people who are in this room right now oh god theres so  many good ones once i had a whole bunch of people try and turn on me when i was /none/ the prince of los  angeles in a vampire game and they tied me up threw me in a coffin wrapped it with tnt and  tried to blow it up and didnt think enough to actually leave the room i survived perfectly but  the shrapnel damaged everybody in the room and literally it was just me standing there looking at  all of them bleeding going you idiots just went down the line and took them all out it was  amazing it felt so good  matt thats pretty epic  taliesin just brush wooden shrapnel at /none/ vampires oh my god they were so dumb dumbest coup ever  it did not go well for them  matt someone please draw that  taliesin this was at the mormon temple too this was the vampire game that the mormon temple was  hosting it was so great we have the coolest mormons in los angeles best vampire larp  matt oh man lets see this is one of the more ridiculous experiences talking about rifts i  think i mentioned this in a couple panels before my friend todd huntington in high school was  obsessed with /none/ rifts it was his favorite system he owned every book rifts uk rifts asia rifts  atlantis wormwood everything palladium he had his big thing was because all the books  technically were in the same ruleset any palladium book was on the table to be used some  way in the game  taliesin terrible idea  matt we had fun with it but part of the fun of rifts was trying to show him how broken rifts was  he was like its the best system ever and we were like its really not and heres why hes /none/  like no its great as we got into the later power levels of the game they also had the  macross license  taliesin i was about to say how can you say its not broken when the sdf1 is available  matt which is what happened  taliesin okay here we go thank you  matt in the macross book they had the rules for the sdf1 which is the giant ship now  everything in rifts has a damage value as a weapon even if its 1d4 times one million megadamage  which some of the higherlevel /none/ ship cannons do there is a damage value except for the sdf1s  main cannon which takes ten minutes to warm up before it fires but were talking death star  style cannon damage destroys everything in its path everything so our team decided lets go  hijack the sdf1 so we went and wiped out the entire crew kept the few that were necessary as  slaves to run the actual ship then we asked todd to hand us one of the other palladium books which  was the pantheon book which had stats and rules for all these /none/ different pantheons all the ancient  sumerian gods like apsu tiamat enki marduk  taliesin you guys loboed  matt yeah they have all the rules for the norse pantheon for the hindu pantheon and they all had  hundreds of millions of hit points but that didnt matter because our gun destroyed  everything in its path so we went god hunting after we took out thor and odin with one shot our  gm todd went this is so stupid im done end of the game but we won  taliesin the sdf1 was like when that thing /none/ came out im like okay weve got to stop playing  this game i remember looking like im done that was the book where im like im done and i  cant pretend that this makes any sense anymore  matt i just envision all the really sweet welldressed macross crew walking across the board  in a very next gen feel like captain we need to all of a sudden this beam in like an apok  from wormwood and someone in a glitter boy outfit starts blasting people laughing the whole time  taliesin that defense system is /none/ all trackball its not that hard to work its three guys with a  trackball going we got it ive watched that show thats not like next gen where like i  wonder what theyre pressing thats a trackball theres no denying it sorry im good  matt thank you taliesin  taliesin i have problems  matt all right other glasses  audience member my questions a bit similar its about having experiences with that guy the guy  who turns into a gibbering mouther in bars or will pee in the paladins boots  taliesin theres a good /none/ rule nazi and theres a bad rule nazi seans a good rule nazi hes the  guy who understands how all the math works and is there to make a shot that shouldnt be possible  but hes read every book and can make terrible things happen and hes fun we have a friend  named sean who we used to play with before he moved away because he hates us he hates us so  much then theres the guys who come in and try and break the game im never happy with why are  you trying to /none/ break a game i dont get it  matt its good to work the system in your favor but at the same time if its at the cost of the  narrative and everyone elses enjoyment then perhaps you need to reassess what kind of game  youre playing with as far as being that guy who constantly messes with the narrative some people  you can curb them to make it work sam riegels a good example of that he skirts the line at times  but he never does it to detract from anybody elses experience and thats /none/ the key when there  is somebody like that you have to talk to them about it after a game like hey man come here  for a second i just want to let you know i know youre having a good time with this but what  youre doing is kind of ruining the experience for a few other people is there any way you can scale  it back or just be mindful of everyone else whos playing as well you might be surprised people  might be open to it and be like oh im sorry i /none/ didnt realize that okay cool thank you for  telling me ill keep that in mind  taliesin a gentle loving conversation can sometimes work wonders i know that sounds weird  but its true genuinely i understand that thats weird  matt if theyre like no screw you im doing this anyway woo spring break  taliesin even that dude nine times out of ten that dude is not ready or prepared for real human  interaction and any actual eye contact in this conversation about your feelings is just going to  turn into a blubbering apologizing like /none/ im so sorry man not all the time but often  matt yeah so try and talk to them if that doesnt work out get with the other players and  find out how you can ambush his character  taliesin shh shh go to sleep shh  matt dont do that  taliesin saving throw saving throw saving throw problem solved the dude who tried to blow  me up also had a ship offshore with cruise missiles why do you have groundtoair missiles  in a vampire the masquerade game you are an idiot what game are you /none/ playing  matt laughing are you serious  taliesin like no i have a ship offshore with groundtoair im like why we are 15  people having a conversation in a backyard of a church what are you doing of a temple not  even ugh  matt talk to them if that doesnt work kill their character  taliesin i keep taking yours you pick one  matt lets go in the back you sir in the way back with the goatee or it mightve been a  shadow with the glasses you it was a shadow im sorry /none/ but you should grow a goatee it would  look good  audience whats your favorite morality to play like chaotic neutral  matt everyones always goto is chaotic neutral because you can do anything and im like eh  but also  taliesin thats no fun being able to do anything thats like chess with no rules who  cares about that  matt honestly i enjoy the idea of playing lawful good to show people that it doesnt have to be  that goody two shoes stick in the mud ruin everyone elses experience alignment  taliesin you /none/ can be captain america  matt yeah  taliesin captain america is a great fun lawful good character to play chaotic good is fun just  because i like having morally ambiguous characters who are not evil im a big fan of that  matt comparably lawful evil can be fun to play because even though you tend to skew towards a  darker morality you understand the necessity of structure and order and the necessary  circumstances in which you must make alliances you wouldnt normally have which is one of the few  alignments that can work in /none/ a good to neutral based group with an evil character one if they  can keep that kind of under wraps or conversely convince the party that it is a  mutually beneficial arrangement they may not trust you but they may still go along with you  that gives you the opportunity to either try and convert other members of the party or conversely  over time maybe see the light theres a lot of different ways you could play that alignment its  a difficult one but it can be a lot of fun  taliesin chaotic evil /none/ doesnt have to be the giggling worst version of the joker ever i had a  chaotic evil character in a game for a while who was great because he pretended to be lawful good  he was this really nice guy that everybody liked and then eventually youd be in a room with him  alone and he would just twisting noise im like let me talk to the innkeeper and kill the  innkeeper and stuff him in the closet and like weve got the run of the place everythings  cool he was slowly undermining everything if /none/ anybodys watched hannibal the television series  it was just that i wonder if i just undermine everything that everybody im working with is  doing right now whats going to happen its a phone call were looking for you you should  probably run thats a great way to play chaotic evil is to not be chaotic evil when anybody else  is around just be this avatar of destruction it can be a lot of fun  matt theres a reason why taliesin is one of my favorite players ive kept him around for a  number of /none/ reasons  taliesin theyre all so innocent they just dont know this is their first game they dont know  how awful it can be  matt well next campaign  taliesin i know im going to ruin them oh you know that you know what terrible things were  going to do to them  matt you pick  taliesin me pick okay you in the corner right there with the hat yes you with the yellow  with my pokemon team instinct  audience member despite dungeons  dragons being such an improvisedbased game the story you have /none/  in critical role is so rich its so good i was wondering  you can be included in this if you want  taliesin oh no its fine  audience member i was wondering how do you divvy up the focus amongst each of the characters so  that none of the characters are really left out per se that everyone has that moment to be the star  matt thats the challenge especially for larger groups i would not recommend for anybody a group  larger than four or five players this just happened to be a large /none/ party which i took upon as  a challenge for myself  audience member she does ten  matt ten why would you do that why youre so crazy  audience member i tried to warn her  matt there you go well now youve been multiwarned  taliesin you cant even make an avengers movie work with that number of people you want to pare  it down  matt its a challenge and you want to be mindful of that because you dont want any players to  feel left out what you do is as youre creating /none/ story not necessarily every session can have a  golden moment for every character but you want to strive for that sort of experience where you can  think of different scenarios where each person has a chance to shine thats where players writing  backstories come in really handy for you is you can find ways to intertwine their history with the  current story thread or future story threads where they not only feel more invested in the current  adventure but you give them an opportunity to really step up and be involved in the resolution  /none/ of that storyline but when youre constructing encounters and dangers and traps and various  challenges keep in mind what the strengths of each party member are and what theyre good at  and try and tailor experiences where they themselves naturally feel inclined to step up and  be like hold on i got this as opposed to being like theres this thing that you should be  doing bard they wont always get it and thats fine theyll stumble because thats half the fun  of the game is watching your players fall over and going heh you /none/ poor kids but it is a  challenge you can only create so much story as a dm when the other half of it is the players  picking it up and running with it it is that collaboration that makes it so magical but also is  a little daunting and complicated to prepare for so be mindful to try and create at least one  experience per player per session where they have the opportunity to rise up and shine a bit  taliesin whether they take it or not  matt yeah whether they take it or /none/ not if they dont then someone else will take it up  phone rings  taliesin ill get it i got it thats nothing  matt just be mindful of that as you prepare  taliesin and ill say from the players side we are very very conscious of not stepping over each  other we take pains on our end to not get in the way of other peoples moments of like oh  ill oh no no no no im not doing that never mind youll actually see us occasionally  start to do something and reel it /none/ back in and its usually the oh no i know whats about to  happen and this has to happen on that side of the table and thats great were very very careful  about that then also the way that we present our backstories i have a really good tip for  backstories and for writing character backstories which is never give the dm any more information  than your character has if your character didnt see it happen you dont know what happened if  your character doesnt know what somebodys motivations were or what organization they worked /none/  for or what people they were influenced by dont tell the dm just tell him what you saw nothing  more dont tell him anything other than what you saw because he will have so much fun with the  rest of it its a great way of definitely creating a situation where you could walk into  what you thought was your origin and just be turned 180 degrees around and you get to  experience that as a character and thats nuts if youve explained everything about how you came  about to the dm thats not /town/ going to happen even though you dont know youre going to just hear  your dm regurgitating what you wrote on a piece of paper six months ago  matt yeah it helps you set up your own mystery essentially youre including the building blocks  for a really really cool series of surprises down the road for you by writing it that way  taliesin dont know that you have a daughter dont know why your parents died dont know where  you came from dont know how you ended up where you are just dont know it its /none/ great the less  you know the more fun the dms going to have  matt mind you add some structure dont hand me a piece of paper that says i dont know  taliesin other than a list of names and vague descriptions and basically what amounted to a  weeks worth of encounters with those people thats all i gave you there was the briarwoods  father anders doctor ripley was literally list of names what happened in those approximately six  days i was in their company and some friends of ours they vaguely resembled and basically /none/ that  was pretty much it go nuts  matt the rest of it i went nuts with  taliesin yes he did  matt all right lets see the glasses and the green shirt back there  audience member i really love dd but im also really paranoid so whenever my character  encounters anything that i personally would find suspicious or dangerous i internally kind of panic  and i almost go into survival mode if i dont get a handle on that its really hard for me to stay  in character and also not metagame i /none/ never want to metagame ever thats a habit im trying to  break are there any tips that you can give me on trying to break this habit of going into survival mode  taliesin you want to go first  matt ill jump in real fast one thing metagaming isnt a bad word i want to specify  this sometimes people on the internet have responded to one of our players unintentionally  metagaming theyll be like oh damn it i hate when they metagame its the worst it happens  were people and it is a game that /none/ were playing while theres an incharacter element there is an  aspect of our brain that is trying to put the pieces together you know from a gamer  standpoint so its going to happen intentionally or not dont beat yourself up over it by any  means its one of those things that comes with comfort and experience the more youre with a  character the easier it is to stay in that mindset the newer you are to a campaign youre  still feeling out their skin youre still getting what separates you from that character and being /none/  able to jump back and forth what youre experiencing is not an uncommon thing every  player goes through that to a certain extent us as performers our lifestyle is jumping into and  out of characters and even we still have it happen every now and then you cant help it its  just taking some time to really understand the mindset of your character think as opposed to what  makes you similar what makes them so different from you and embrace that difference and really  adhere to that the best you can when the survival /none/ instinct kicks in take a step back take a  breath and remember what that characters thought process is what makes them different from you  then jump back in and hold onto that difference thats whats going to help you kind of stay in  character and keep from metagaming in that moment its not perfect its hard to be perfect because  were all broken human beings by nature thats just our existence but that does help  taliesin yeah as a player you are the broken god of a broken player its fabulous on that  level /none/ you are definitely occasionally feeding your character information that they dont  necessarily have but because its in there its just inevitably going to push you in  certain directions thats not a bad thing im also a big fan of it takes a little getting used to  but trying to fight the normal natural riskaversion of ones day to day life and being  okay with abandoning that riskaversion once you hit the graph paper its tricky but this is  where you can take a risk and the worst thing thats going to happen is youre going /none/ to  have to reroll a character thats great thats a great way to get even in life more comfortable with  the inevitability of risky decisions im a big fan of especially if youre new to the game and  youre having a little bit of panic or fight or flight when playing play a character with a  little bit of fight or flight teenage feral barbarian is a great way yells hit it with a stick  that way you can lean into it if youre feeling like you want to get comfortable with  everything and /tavern/ not feel like youre fighting yourself the other thing and i dont actually do  this for critical role but i used to do it for my games when i was a teenager im a dressup fan  we used to get some of us in high school we used to get drunk get stupid and dress up and play axis and  allies in stupid costumes while drinking lots of beer possibly under the age of appropriateness  vampire larping and all that stuff for some of my earlier characters i would have a piece of jewelry  especially /none/ rings or something like that which was like okay its character time im sure youve  seen when i play i do a minute of just sitting and thinking and just going through my percy brain a  ring or a necklace thats something you can play with at the table and you only wear when youre  playing its game time this happens its your uniform you put it on and them you have this thing  to constantly remind you where your head is supposed to be when its done it comes  off im a big fan /none/ of that  matt thats really good the last thing ill say on that topic is its honestly as fun sometimes to  let yourself fail than it is to succeed in these rpgs so when that instinct kicks in youre like  i know thats dangerous i shouldnt go towards it even though my character wouldnt know just  think but man my character walking right into this is going to make such a great surprise moment  for the rest of the characters and the story i might just have to let it happen  taliesin for whoever /none/ survives its going to be awesome  matt exactly be okay with embracing failure and bad scenarios even though your brain tells you  otherwise if the character wouldnt know let them walk into that trap  taliesin failure is so much more glorious than victory oh man ive had a number of amazing and  beautiful shots with those weapons but taking 25 bullets to the chest and dropping like a fly is  going to be the best thing i ever did thats an epic failure thats brilliant  matt yeah weve got time for a few more /none/  taliesin green shirt  audience member matt ive heard this story of your first character a couple times the militant  wizard and how much of a big giant failure that is  matt yes he was  laughter  audience member have you had any other characters where everything just falls apart once it hits the game  matt oh yeah i played a midlands game where i made a guy whos like a 75yearold crotchety  sharpshooter but i took every single penalty i possibly could so he was nearsighted he was just  an ornery fella /tavern/ he was just the worst person nobody liked him nobody hung around him he just  got drunk and passed out in every alleyway everyone was like why is he still alive and why  is he still here nobody liked him but every now and then he could pull out his sixshooter and  just destroy  taliesins phone rings  taliesin i literally put it on silent i just put it on silent keep talking im going to kill  everything that makes noise  matt it was a character that completely broke down when we got to /none/ the game and it was glorious  because every party member had their strength he was a sharpshooter but he had terrible vision  and he couldnt shoot anything so he literally missed every single attack but man wasnt he  excited to take the credit for every victory they had he was useless mechanically but from a story  standpoint he was an amazing character to have for the rest of the party because he annoyed  everybody but everyone found that that ridiculous confidence and the lack of capability was  endearing in a weird way so he /none/ became this mascot of the party for a while  taliesin thats a hard walk man if youre the character no one likes eventually youre just  going to be the character that no one likes if youre not careful thats a really tough one  matt well you have to make it in a way where theyre comedic and how ridiculous and over the  top they are in their confidence and still able to buy them a round of drinks because hes the  papa bear who helped save them all  taliesin yeah and not ruining everything /none/ which is a big one  matt good question lets see hi vex  audience member hi i have a question for percy did you actually hear what went on when you were  getting resurrected  taliesin maybe  laughter  audience member can i roll a persuasion check  laughter  taliesin ill allow it wait no up here  applause  taliesin just so all of you know im not making a habit of this this was just way too amusing of  a thing to do so im letting this go once  matt if you /none/ wink youll probably get advantage  taliesin oh  laughter applause  audience member on the table  matt it was a natural 20 on the table so it was a 14 plus lets see it was a 5 modifier for  being proficient in that so thats 19 plus the charisma bonus so thats easily 23  taliesin oh im fucked then  matt because she multiclassed into rogue and took the expertise feat its double proficiency  bonus so  applause  cheering  taliesin that was so worth it on every conceivable level that was genius you /none/ with the  goggles yes hi  audience member so i confess im more of a watcher than a player since this has come out on  the internet ive watched wil wheaton ive watched critical role ive watched force grey  which has ripped my heart out i think people know exactly what im talking about  taliesin i havent seen it yet  matt hey man  audience member i will never look at goo the same way again but when i was growing up most of pop  cultures idea of dungeons  dragons was the angry /dung/ fat nerds who would be in the dungeon of their  basement arguing about but that roll was right or that creatures too powerful now im  looking at it and im seeing wow its a great story and it has people i respect playing it and  theres lots of different people playing it how do you feel the internet has helped that image  has it helped that image  taliesin i dont think its the internet  matt to be fair i was and am that fat guy in the basement arguing about the rules still thats /none/  always been a part of it but because when it first became a cultural phenomenon whenever  anything is misunderstood at large by the public people then label it pigeonhole it and shove it  aside its never really been just that theres been a large faction initially of the gygaxian era  of chainmail players and there was definitely a  taliesin i was in a few of those games as a teenager but i was also in a few games like i  was always baffled because we had a couple of the basement games we also /none/ had all the goth kids  playing at one point at our school we just got a third a bunch of the cheerleading squad and a  couple of the football players playing because whatever people were into it but who were you telling  matt its always been more diverse than people expected it to be i think what the internets  helping with its giving a platform for everyone to show how diverse the community has always been  and is continuing to be i think whats great about livestreaming games and a lot of people  being /town/ able to be more open about this hobby is its giving people one the confidence to be  like oh yeah no i totally play these games and theyre a lot of fun and heres my gaming  group conversely allowing a whole new generation of people to embrace it because they  thought for a long time it was something that you dont talk about and now it can be cool to  discuss about it in the older crowd and a new generation of people that are being exposed to it  for the first time and being /none/ like oh this is actually really cool and different than any other  form of entertainment ive done and starting up their own gaming groups in school then merging  taliesin the other big thing that happened is all those kids that we were playing with at least  back in los angeles all those kids that we were playing with in high school now write television  shows and direct movies like all of them theres a reason something like stranger things  exists and it comes out and youve got stephen colbert just going like oh yeah i /none/ played dd  as a kid and hes just talking like theres so many people in the business who played dd as a teenager  matt the fact that the person ive seen geek out hardest over a natural 20 roll is vin diesel  should help push the diversity factor of how many people have been affected by this type of gaming experience  taliesin does anybody here know tj storm for gods sakes tj storm is this amazing voice  actor an amazing stunt man and hes basically six and a half feet tall 350 pounds of muscle /dung/  and braided dreadlocks big black martial artist and we didnt meet him doing vo we met him in a  dd game  matt yeah he did all the mocap for godzilla in the recent godzilla movie  taliesin he was colossus in deadpool as the mocap actor and like oh god thats tj from dd  what yo what are you doing here  matt he was the dungeon master he had all the books and was like all right were making  characters sit down  taliesin sundays karate in the park saturday dd  matt its /none/ always been diverse and its continuing to grow more and more so as more people  have the opportunity to be exposed to it now its a cool thing to talk about again which is great  im excited to see where it goes from here nothing makes me more excited than having people  send me pictures of their game group some of them are a whole spread of ethnicities and varying sexes  taliesin someones parents are playing  matt yeah its a family thing ive seen so many people that like their kids and their parents  /dung/ play together now and its this great bonding experience with the family core there isnt a lot  of opportunity for people to enjoy something as a family quite like this  taliesin my younger older brothers a dungeon master and my younger younger brother is playing  now with his friends in colorado  matt maniacal laugh  taliesin should we keep going  matt weve got two more were supposed to rush over to our signing its 102 one more quick  question taliesin youve got it  taliesin okay i know im just going to feel guilty /none/ no matter who i pick but you in the  back yes you  audience member hi when you guys started broadcasting i thought oh thats cool we  should do one too inaudible we have nine people they all keep coming back everyone has a  lot of fun im so overwhelmed sometimes when weve got npcs inaudible so ive tried to do  things like roll all their initiatives ahead of time  matt thats a way to do it yeah  audience member is there anything else i can do to try to help theyre all having /none/ fun im having  fun but  taliesin your hourglass thing that you do every now and then is just the meanest thing on earth  theres always that the chess clock  matt putting a timer and giving people a very limited period of time to succeed or decide is  always fun doing the initiative order ahead of time is great whatever you can do to reduce the  amount of rolls everyone has to make or doing group rolls like if they have to do a group  stealth check designate somebody in the group that is /none/ the designated roller for that  circumstance who does like three rolls average them out you can find ways to keep those a little  more streamlined and creatively come up with ways to help you do that also you can have two dms i  ran a game for a couple years with me and my friend zach hanks both codmed which allowed us  both to get together to write the stories having someone to bounce story ideas off which means you  construct cooler ideas  taliesin there would be 20 minutes a game where it would /none/ just be him and zach having npc  conversations between each other while the rest of us were going  matt which helps because then you have half as many npcs you designate an npc to one or the  other and that person always deals with that npc  taliesin hes just an angrily good voice actor also zachs so talented oh god  matt also you have one person handling the music while youre setting a scene or vice versa or  while youre tracking initiative and whose turn order it is hes handling the monster combat rounds /none/  having a codm can be a really good way to alleviate some of that pressure and plus you have  a partner in crime now  taliesin you only had like five players in that game that was nothing that was six players  matt five players six and then sean left  taliesin okay and then marisha came in to replace him okay yeah five  matt guys we are over time for our panel thank you so much for hanging  taliesin well see you at the signing  matt please dont be pained if were a /none/ little pressed we have a lot of people we want to get  through we want to make sure everyone gets signed and we have  taliesin were so sorry if we go a little faster than normal we do apologize  matt were trying well shake hands we love you guys see you in a minute  light piano music  audience member so i just got back from a critical role panel and i asked taliesin if he had  heard everything that people said during his resurrection i rolled a persuasion check with  advantage because of
