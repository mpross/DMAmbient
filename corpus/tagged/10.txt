to  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  liam autoerotic apixieation  matt you /none/ were real late on the draw but this is the night to do it i guess  liam right on time  matt it was perfect precisely when you mean to all right last we left off vox machina through  their trials and tribulations had eventually come to realize the machinations of vecna who ascended  into godhood transported his city from the shadowfell of thar amphala to the top right above  a longdead earth primordial titan rising it and making its way toward vasselheim the dawn city  the beginning of creation  you battled your way /none/ through its innards up within the arcane dome that protected it managed  to defeat one half of the longfrustrating briarwood coupling fought your way to the top of  the tower entropis did battle with vecna the ascended through careful planning and sacrifices  you managed to apply the trammels complete the sealing ritual and send vecna screaming across  the divine gate to be sealed to wherever his divine demiplane resides on the other side  as you all fell down upon the ruined floating platforms of the tower entropis you glanced over  as your recent ally /none/ arkhan the cruel proceeded to sever his own hand attach the hand of vecna  and catching you off guard transport himself beyond your current reach this beat of intensity  releasing slowly the adrenaline still wearing its way through your veins you sit in silence  looking about amazed that you all still stand after such a confrontation  its at that moment you hear this distant explosion glancing off the side of the platform  youre on you can still see while the large titan one of four arms raised attempting to come  and destroy all of /none/ you with one large blow frozen in place there still remains the dregs of vecnas  army down below throughout the city of vasselheim where battles are still raging in the streets you  can still see wyvernriders and eagleriders in the sky though it appears that the gloomstalkers  that once paraded across the skies over the city have been destroyed or scattered at the loss of  the ascended god that summoned them you also still are aware of the body of your sister  residing on the platforms below its at this point that you notice that /none/ the green tendrils of  energy that hold the tower of entropis together begin to flicker and subside the platforms that  were slowly drifting listing suddenly begin to shift  laura no i take off on my broom and i go down to try to get her  matt okay you guys dart over the side what are the rest of you guys doing  travis i had the immovable rod pulled out and i click it where i am  matt all right you hold in place you feel the platform give beneath you your toes are now /none/  dangling in the middle of the air as you watch the crackedopen right side of entropis peak begin to  topple and fall beneath you what are you guys doing  marisha im still a planetar do you still have bigbys hand up  sam for maybe 30 seconds more  taliesin wheres the carpet  travis its in my bag  marisha i do a potato sack hold on scanlan make sure hes all right  matt you grab him pike still has some time she still has her wings  travis i can throw it to you /none/  taliesin that would be nice yes please  travis can i pull the carpet out of the bag of holding do you want to free fall and go after it  matt by the way the platform is now giving underneath you  sam why dont you fly it over  travis i dont think i can be on it with him right im still enlarged  marisha here can one of us fly over and get it  laura technically he was on the broom with me so i couldve dropped him off with one of you  /none/ before i flew down to velora  matt as youre having this conversation about the carpet youre dragged down over the side as the  broom rockets off vexs mind currently focused more on other things so the last thing you hear  from percival is could you throw as he darts off to the side the platform is beginning to give  as the flickering green energy begins to fade you guys both dart beneath where you can see upon the  rubble where the top staircase had broken apart from the original sundering of the top of the /none/  tower there you see still lying there lifeless the body of velora you rush in there just as the  platforms collapsing i need you both to make acrobatics checks on this to see how quickly you  can maneuver in and out  laura okay its 30  liam 31  matt both of you guys rush inward as some of the various chunks are beginning to fall and separate  from underneath the platforms you begin to dart through dodge and you grab and lift her body  both of you cradling her and at a moments /none/ notice deciding which one of yous going to take her  liam ive got her  matt all right vax you go ahead and dart off you careen back out of the way as the central  large platform crashes down with a heavy impact you can see it crumble then break and three  separate pieces beginning to tumble the tower then gives in from underneath and begins to  collapse downward almost like a controlled demolition as it begins to fall and topple down  below you all gather your thoughts and consider other allies that were recently /none/  travis falling  matt a short time ago yes  laura zahra and kash  marisha with scanlan in hand start diving down to go see if i can find them or have any sight of  them at all  matt whats the flying speed of your planetar  marisha 150 feet  matt okay as you holding scanlan under your arm coast down at a speed to the point where now  youre actually racing the crumbling of the tower youre watching the actual cracks as they emerge  as the energys dissipating beginning to subside as /none/ your speed overtakes the rate in which its  collapsing  marisha like superman and lois lane  matt laughter the gs are intense scanlan your eyes are watering blown back on your face  the ioun symbol on your forehead is flaring like a spotlight ahead of you as you rocket down you  glance you can see there across the rocks at the bottom two wyverns that are scattered across the  rubble and you see lying there the bodies of kashaw and zahra  sam theyre dead turn around lets go back theyre dead  marisha shut /none/ up scanlan are they dead  matt make a perception check  travis how high am i hanging off of this thing  matt make  travis a perception check i am a million eight  matt youre high up there thats a long way up  marisha 18  laura you can use the carpet because percys on the broom with me  matt their bodies are brutalized from the impact they hit  marisha theyre splatted  matt well theyre not splatted  laura theyre not you on the cliff  marisha sure they didnt goldfish it  /none/ travis but a good revivify might help  sam theyre unconscious  matt youre just now approaching as you get there you can hear the rumbling of the tower  getting louder youve barely beaten it what are you doing  marisha ive got to move them right is that what youre saying scanlan youre fine right  handle yourself  matt scanlan she sets you on the ground as you look over and see the tower crashing  marisha do you want to hold onto my back  sam i have no spells left so yes  laughter  /none/ sam i will climb on  taliesin i imagine scanlan dropping that last potion as its coming down  matt okay as you dive on you grab both of their limp bodies and pull them under your arms and dart  i need you to make a dexterity saving throw please  laura oh my god if we thought we made it out of this  marisha okay 18 no wait yeah 18  matt 18 you manage to scoot by as one of the large chunks of the base falls over to one side  and as you dart /none/ out wings before you scanlan clutched on your back both their bodies beneath  you can feel the gust of wind from behind as the collapsing wall is pushing all the air in your  direction as you focus down your wings out you manage to careen underneath as the shadow that was  beginning to fall over you pulls behind and behind you hear the boom the dust pick up and  you guys all look down and watch as the tower finally falls to its final piece of rubble there  on the ground at which point you /none/ glance down and you can see both of them their eyes roll open  lolling in their face both zahra and kashaw seemingly conscious if you guys want to step in  cheering  marisha im going to immediately burn two of my healing touches and you get 6d8 plus three hit  points back  matt kashaw and zahra youve been lying there on the ground for a moment going ow and as your  vision focuses you watch as the tower begins to collapse downward in your direction the shadow  seems to close over you  will /none/ well thats not good  marisha 29 hit points to both of you immediately  matt and with a flash something whitefeathered and blue shoots past you grabs you and you are  thrust into the air carried by the angelic form of keyleth  mary kiki how are you darling  marisha did you recognize me because of the antlers thats why i keep them theyre very  identifying  mary i think i dreamed of you  marisha no that was real and incredible and you all showed up  sam why did you come  will we

everybody else  marisha i look /tavern/ up and say grog do you need a hand are you all right damn it the pun wasnt  intended scanlan  laughter  travis i literally just said that  marisha do you need

pretty close to where you are for a second there you glance down roll a  perception check  travis ten  matt you see a gloomstalker /none/ coming right at you  travis screams  matt as you hold the sword out in front you notice in a second its zahra  travis oh not a gloomstalker  matt but the sword at this point as you hold it out in front of you and push back it goes one  part is done well

flexing the wings out and around and im making a feather bed with the ends of the  wings on the ground and laying velora down on it  laura kash tell me you have revivify tell me you can bring her back

to that  liam your sense of humor is your best quality  will isnt it  liam best  will well get her shell be fine  matt as you guys take a /none/ moment and realize the time the involvement that would be here to do the  spell you glance about in the streets of thar amphala and what straggling undead andor  cultists seem to have been either trying to scramble back up to the city or hadnt made their  way down through or were here as sentinels are frantically trying to escape and being cut down  and grabbed by the various eagle riders and the rest of the army thats currently now beginning to  swarm in thanks to the complete falling of the barrier with the sealing /none/ of vecna you do feel at  this moment that you do have some time in thar amphala without any immediate danger  will but if it gets to that i can stay and raise her and you guys can go and take care of the city  laura thank you  marisha i dont even know if i have a full hour left on my form thats the only problem thats  why i would need help but  will she needs to rest anyway  mary i can stay ill stay with him  laura thank you  /none/ mary well focus on her  sam well all stay until we dont have to  laura yeah  marisha i help kash as much as i can  matt okay  laura i sit down and hold her hand  matt all right  liam start cleaning her cheeks as well as we can  marisha and i dont take my eyes off of vax the whole time  sam oh yeah shit  will im holding my medal starting the spell  matt as you guys form a perimeter here at the base of entropis the sky now /none/ open the clouds  dispelled and scattered and probably for the first time in weeks especially from your guys  perspective vasselheim sees a sky of blue the sunlight rains down from above and the warmth  that comes through is very comforting as you begin to clear the space and scrawl out the sigils and  glyphs necessary for this raise dead ritual as youre going through the process and you quietly  begin to focus you can see some of the eagle riders and straggling wyvern riders take notice  and begin to come close and then stop /none/ and keep a distance and recognizing the significance of this  moment respectfully stay away  will as hes casting the glyphs he goes over hes about to write the last one and he walks  over to vex and he takes one tear and he goes back over and uses it to do the last glyph  matt as he draws the last glyph with the tear that one seems to have an additional flair a  connection a sparkle of bloodline connectivity between you and the deceased as you complete the  spell i need you to go /none/ ahead and bring to this ritual what youd like  sam oh god  laura jesus really oh god i take one of my arrows that has the owlbear feather on it and i  put it down next to her because i know she loved owlbears  matt okay go ahead and roll a d20 for me okay anybody else  liam i pull simon from around my waist and i start to fasten it around her this is yours  youre going to have to take care of him now his name is simon most people dont think /none/ hes alive  but theyre wrong hes very much alive take care of him for me i didnt get nearly enough time  with you im sorry i love you very much i kiss her on the forehead  matt roll another d20  liam i rolled an 18 but im going to use luck good 18 is good  matt okay  mary i take the moonstone from my staff and i clasp it in my hands and i say sirius you asked  me to be here and to judge them they are worthy give me this boon /none/ help me save this girl for  true friendship which i never had until now help me save her help us all save her and i place the  moonstone down next to her head  matt okay go ahead and roll a d20 for me  mary ill use luck  matt if you want to  mary 12  matt okay as you complete the ritual all the sigils in place lighting up its unique because  youre used to the ritual completed by an acolyte of sarenrae in which everything has a glow of  warmth to /none/ it this ritual was completed by an acolyte of an entity named vesh and as each sigil  flares you watch as they darken into the deepest shadow its a yinyang dichotomy as the spell  begins to take effect until eventually the whole circle becomes pitch black like the deepest of  lightless midnight at that moment you watch as veloras form itself is also cast into shadow and  disappears from view and for a moment you fear she is gone before the shadow begins to peel away  like a cocoon and as it tears and rolls /none/ back the subtle sound of sand shifting and paper crackling  you watch as her chest begins to move once more breathing her eyes still closed but life  breathes into her lungs once more with a natural 19  laura i hug her oh and i pop trinket out of his necklace and i cast cure wounds on him so he can  lick her face  matt okay as trinket comes out trinket is burned and battered armor dinged up and screwed  up on his face its askew to one side  travis he got meteored  /none/ laughter  matt yeah he did  travis i didnt sign up for this shit  laura ive still got a 3rdlevel cure wounds on him  matt all right  mary i cast beast speak you all right trinket  matt i dont care and trinket comes forward to velora and begins licking her face and she who is  breathing but unconscious the eye begins to slowly open what and her eyes open up a little  bit and you can see her skin darkened from the blast and the rubble and the dust thats now begun  /none/ to settle around the base of entropis and she looks up and first sees the lapping tongue of  trinket against her cheek and giggles and pushes him away a little bit then she sees the feather  and looks at it and now looks up to see the person thats holding her and looks and meets both of  your gazes  laura hi little monkey  matt hi  liam youre an awfully long way from home  matt what happened  laura you went on an adventure thats all  matt she gets quiet for a second /none/ trying to remember trying to recall im very tired  laura of course  matt and she curls up and pulls tighter around vexs neck  will kash steps in you dont feel evil do you  laughter  matt she pulls back and looks over at you whos this human  laura oh he saved your life just now dear  liam hes a friend come here  will all right  laura no but seriously could she be evil seriously  will no theres no you feel okay  matt she arranges the situation and looks back at /none/ you and goes giggles  will shes fine

you too mary  mary oh baby dont do that  matt at this point you begin to hear distant horns echoing throughout the city streets  distant emanating throughout as you glance over you havent heard these horns before but they  sound less like horns of warning and more like horns of victory glancing down in the streets  there are still flames and columns of smoke and you can still see scuffles beneath the siege weaponry  attacks against the titan have subsided and it /none/ has not moved at all it is locked in place a large  statuesquelike mountain of an ancient entity now lording over the edge of the braving grounds  almost creeping upon the outskirts of the quad roads towards the center of the city leaving a  path of destruction in its wake most of the braving grounds is in tatters but  laura i look at percy this would be a wonderful place for a summer home  chuckles  will and mary weve got to go  sam what no  mary we have to leave  will /none/ they need us back  mary yeah  liam dont be

sam thank you  laura bye loves  liam see you later smart ass  mary thank you  will bastard treat her well or im going to come back  laura hey youve got your hands full all right  will thats true too  matt and /none/ as she completes a secondary fly spell these two coast off over the edge of thar amphala  down into the center of vasselheim on their own at which point you notice three battledisheveled  wyvern riders that were waiting at the side begin to approach one of them you recognize as a  captain signified by these ivory horns that curl out of the back of the helmet and grow longer than  the regular wyvern riders armor youve encountered having stepped off the armored drake  that currently waits shaking its head large leathery wings dug into the /none/ nearby rubble the  warrior approaches pulling the helmet off revealing a tumble of braided amber hair with  shaved sides and a rather sternlooking woman that you dont recognise vox machina i am captain  obelin i would ask does this shift in tide signify anything does the lich still loom about  laura he fucking dead  taliesin does not the battle is won  laura hes been sealed away  matt it is done  travis it is  taliesin fucking dead  laughter  travis lady vexahlia  taliesin lady yes  matt the gods grant /none/ their grace upon vasselheim still we thank you well theres little time to  celebrate theres still much to be done but please bring this information to the platinum  sanctuary to somewhere of significance in the city this information needs to go out this will  greatly bolster the ranks morale of those  marisha start spreading the word yourself you can help us out right  matt oh we shall she looks over her shoulder at the other soldiers  taliesin ive got the last flare from whitestone from all those years ago  laura i have a /none/ purple flare too we should all set them off  marisha i was going to say i think i still have a skywrite  sam lets do it  marisha yep  laura i send up my purple flare too  sam i pull out my gun  laughter  travis yes  marisha oh my god  travis i forgot you have one  liam what a callback  taliesin ive been waiting for it  travis please misfire please blow your hand off  sam lets do this yells  laughter  matt okay roll a d20  /none/ travis please  taliesin no  sam natural 20  taliesin no  sam machine gun noises  liam say hello to my even littler friend  travis oh my god  matt so as you guys send up your colored whitestone crest flares into the sky what do you  skywrite  marisha vecna defeated  laura thats a lot of writing  taliesin thats a lot of words  matt the wisps of cloud begin to spell across  sam v def  marisha laughs i can write it out  taliesin you can  matt yeah as /none/ it coasts across you hear this loud echoing gunshot as the n in the middle of  vecna seems to dissipate with a little puff as a perfectly aimed bullet from one pistol that does  not backfire because that would have been fucking funny  taliesin its all i wanted tonight  travis so good  matt roll a performance check  sam performance come on 28  matt 28 for a man who has only shot a pistol once he revolver ocelots that shit  laura hes been practicing that shit in his bedroom  marisha yeah in /none/ the mirror  travis behind the back oh shit  laughter  sam ive been watching you  travis percys like i dont do that shit  laughter  taliesin yeah no  matt these flares bursting and slowly descending coming down and bringing this it was a purple  flare and what was the color of yours  taliesin gold if i recall  matt so gold and purple begin to burn down below giving this strange atmospheric light to the  outside of the large still titan form as the words across the sky you begin to hear /none/ this low  gathering of cheers thousands upon thousands upon thousands of voices where you once heard screaming  and yelling now join in unison a rallying cry of victory that crawls across the entirety of  vasselheim around you on all sides what do you guys want to do  travis i need that hand  sam do we have locate object or something  liam i do  laura i mean yeah  sam is it an object i guess its inanimate now  matt it is considered an object now  liam i do  laura thats /none/ good  liam i got it ive seen it i have the spell slot  matt all right so you cast locate object and you have a very strong vision of the direction and  its maybe a hundred feet to your left and it is under quite a bit of rubble  liam big man come on im going to need you to dig its over here  travis not a problem  matt all right  sam rage dig  matt giving him direction ragedigging through tossing veritable small boulders with onehanded  scoops you guys are having /none/ to dodge out of the way as they go flying by and skidding to a halt  maybe 50 60 feet behind him go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage because of his aid  travis thats about as good as it gets because thats even worse 16  matt 16 okay  travis with a minus two  matt it takes you a little while but thanks to locate object you cruise through and you  eventually find its been smashed but its still intact and there you see the completely cut off  redscaled clawed hand /none/ of arkhan the cruel  travis he fucked us  marisha sam and liam yeah  laura he helped us and then he fucked us yeah  marisha i guess the help was worth the fucking but only a little bit  travis yeah  matt the voice creeps into your head take it find him he has to die  travis feel like i should take this and try and find him hes got to fucking die  laura yeah he probably does  travis he was so cool and strong and only his physique rivals my own but /none/ i feel like hes got  to die  liam please he couldnt touch you are you kidding  marisha you know youre not having  travis couldnt  laura you seem to like him a lot are you sure you want to kill him and not just try to get  marisha grog  travis what hold on  marisha we all think youre strong you dont need to have an inferiority complex  travis a what  laura yeah i dont think hes going to understand  liam i dont think he has those  travis so hes /none/ a paladin of  sam tiamat  travis right is that a good or a bad  sam bad im guessing  matt make a religion check with advantage because you still have well the blessing would have  worn off  liam that thing could rot do you know what preserves a hand  laura the bag of colding  sam more than 20  matt yeah tiamats very bad known as the scaled tyrant she resides in the nine hells and is the  patron deity of all chromatic dragons  sam oh yeah shes the dragon god /none/ she  matt she the opposite of bahamut  travis of good dragons or bad  sam bad dragons  travis okay i feel like he had a good insight but the hand does bad things right  laura the hand does really bad things you know what you should do is bring that to bahamut  liam yeah after you piss on it  marisha why are you so connected to the pissing thing  laura dont piss on it grog  travis but he said preserve it  laura but then maybe if they try to use the /none/ hand to find it it might lead them to you instead  because youve already pissed on it  travis lead them to my junk  laura potentially  travis people have come looking for it for less  laura you dont want people chopping off your junk thinking your junk is vecnas hand do you  travis it doesnt even look like a hand just like one really big middle finger  laughter  liam its like a mole right  travis yeah all right i have it im not going to preserve it  laura put it in /none/ the bag of colding  liam such a mistake  sam thats on the todo list well go find him  laura all right  travis and bahamut is the platinum  laura tiamats the bad guy  travis no bahamut is the good dragon of the platinum variety  all yes  travis would you say they are at odds  taliesin and sam yes  liam safe bet  travis like godzilla and king kong  liam i dont know those references but yeah they are at odds  marisha whatshername worshipped bahamut  laura kima  marisha /none/ was it kima kima kima worships bahamut  travis she was badass  liam and laura yes  travis ill just hold on to the hand right now  laura whats going on there grog  travis nothing we just had a big fight  taliesin youre making that monologue face like that face someone makes when theyre listening to  some very complex internal monologue you dont make that face very often youre making it right  now just start speaking whatevers in your head right now freeform  travis i have to go after the hand i must /none/ kill vecna i have to do these things  taliesin okay this is starting to paint a picture you feel better now  travis nuhhuh  taliesin okay  marisha is that going on all the time in your head  travis no  marisha okay  taliesin are you lying right now  sam he nodded when he said no  liam dm just for funsies do i sense vecna in any way shape or form  matt no  liam okay definitely want to piss on that hand grog  laura dont piss on the hand number one /none/ its already in the bag of colding and i dont want  everything else pissed on  liam grog and i dont share much  taliesin except pissing  laughter  taliesin it was an honest question  travis thats true  laura what should we do you guys  taliesin im so tired  marisha i grab onto vax and dont let go  sam we have more pressing concerns  taliesin that does remind me scanlan  sam what  taliesin youre going to have to give it back now  sam give what back  taliesin you /none/ know exactly what  sam the gun  taliesin yes  travis that was part of a trade  sam this is my gun  taliesin i dont think its your gun  sam i found it  taliesin you didnt  travis no there was a trade of items i got a cloak of smashing out of it and you got other stuff  sam i found it fair and square its my gun  taliesin theres no fair and square and honestly if you were anybody else i would find  it when i was rummaging through your /dung/ corpse later but its you so instead i just use my words and  im trying to be a better person if you really like it maybe well have a special one made  thats a little safer but not that one thats one of mine  sam i look so cool  taliesin ill make you something fancy thats a little less prone to explode  liam scanlan you should know you always look cool always  taliesin especially with the head thing its quite nice  marisha yeah this is awesome does he still have the blessing  /none/ matt the blessing has faded by now  taliesin you should get that tattooed in permanently  marisha yeah  sam thats a good idea  taliesin thats a really good idea  marisha i can draw on you with the remaining remnants that way you have it there always  sam i love it  marisha okay i try to draw the outline of the remaining glyph on his head  matt so you take some ash and charcoal from the nearby rubble and loosely draw the symbol on his  forehead roll a dexterity check  marisha okay /none/ straight dex dont fuck me gil 14  matt 14 its passable  marisha yeah that right there thats perfect get that tattooed  sam all right its going to happen i feel like we should all get a tattoo to commemorate this  taliesin on the forehead  laura and marisha definitely on the forehead  liam well maybe in different places we dont all need to get it in the same place maybe on a  theme but not the exact same thing  laura we already all got tattoos didnt we  taliesin well we got tattoos /dung/ thats all that matters  travis no we didnt  marisha im not sure what were talking about anymore  laura no i thought we got them in character  marisha no he got them  liam i got one and i got one  laura oh we got the slayers take  marisha wait were branded and then ive got mine and then he has his  liam i have the burnt hand on my back elven no its not mostly healed scanlan shorthalt you  dont need a gun

marisha bullshit my passive perception is 21  matt yeah you guys totally see him its the worst example  liam thats the trick i do for my eightyearold  taliesin look at it go wow  laughter  travis you caught it you threw it  sam around the world  travis oh my god  laughter  travis i faint  laughter /none/  laura hey while hes out should we get this sword off him  liam why  laura because it seems like hes a little weird from it nobody else feels that way  taliesin i think so  travis gasps youre so strong whatd i miss  laura nothing  marisha we were talking about you i mean we were talking about sorry im still working on it  laura yeah no its getting better should we get off of the titan maybe  sam it could fall  taliesin does anyone want to start walking towards the city /none/ to see how bad it really is  laura well have to get through the titan or we can fly down outside of that i dont know  sam how many of us can fly well i guess we could take a couple of trips on the carpet  taliesin weve got a carpet some of us have wings  liam and marisha my wings are gone  matt yeah your wings are gone pikes wings are gone you guys have your broom you have the  carpet  sam so we can take three trips on the carpet or /none/ something  taliesin we can ride on the broom  marisha have we taken a short rest at this point  matt yeah you guys would have taken a short rest at this point  marisha my beast shapes back  matt ill say for the purposes of when you were helping with the ritual that he was casting  because thats an hour long that would have been a short rest easy  liam what are you going to be  marisha well what do you want to fly in on what do you want  liam dragon  /none/ marisha i cant do that i can do anything in the animal kingdom  travis before we go down before we leave what about sylas  laura gasps sylas  marisha he flew away  laura right but hes repairing somewhere  travis they have coffins right  liam we deduced that it doesnt take him that long to come back together and its been  matt not terribly long  liam but were right at that cutoff point  matt maybe  taliesin try to scry on him hes probably having a bad day theres enough time  marisha /none/ ill scry on him  taliesin theres a gold dragon that should be  marisha oh i havent used any of my 5thlevel spells  laura do you have daylight still something with sun i guess sunlight would take him out because  its during the day  marisha yeah i still have 3rdlevel spells yep i also have my 6thlevel spells i have sunbeam  learned which is dope  liam thats all you need  marisha okay im going to scry on him  taliesin grog do you want to trade boots by the way again  matt /none/ okay and hes used all of his resistances  taliesin we dont have to if you really like them  marisha hes used all of his legendary resistances is that what that was  matt yeah that is a natural 19 plus seven wisdom save so thats a 26  marisha oh my god  sam he beat your scry  marisha he rolled a natural 19  matt natural 19  laura you cant do it  marisha i can do it again can i do it again  matt if you have another spell slot for it  /none/ marisha i do it again  matt natural 16 plus seven so thats a 23  sam that wins  laura can i try to cast locate object on the pants he was wearing  liam thats amazing  laura theyre an object  taliesin she has seen them  laura ive seen them  taliesin theyre very nice  matt let me consult the verbiage of  liam this is amazing and i love you that is amazing  taliesin that is the greatest thing ive ever heard locate pants i would like to scry upon the  pants /none/ the pantalones  liam on his loafers  matt okay all right cool and you have a 2ndlevel spell slot for this  laura yes  matt so as you complete the spell and try to focus as hard as you can on the pants of lord  sylas briarwood  taliesin he has pajamas he changes into  liam theyre batman pajamas  matt nothing  laura nothing hes definitely recovering naked fuck nothing  marisha no pants  laura no pants  liam hes in the buck  marisha you guys hes shirtcocking somewhere  laughter  matt /none/ he prepared he knew its the only way they wont find me he pulls his tearaways off  and chucks them  travis just goes up and says hi to people  marisha flashing innocents through all the city  matt its his dominate action  travis yeah right  laura were going to have to worry about him at some point  sam not now  marisha i can try and scrying eye him i also still have one more 5thlevel spell  laura yeah but how are we going to take him out if you use all your /none/ spells to find him  marisha i have a 6th  travis maybe we let him go  liam shes saying you got one more shot and we still have some sunlight  laura and marisha one more time  matt well you used the scrying eye before you took the long rest in the feywild or was it  after  liam that was for finding the sword of kas wasnt it before we slept  matt yeah that would have been before yeah okay so you can use it  marisha but im using my 5thlevel spell first /none/  matt okay you are  marisha yeah im using my 3rd  matt thats a natural seven  sam that could work  matt as you close your eyes and focus trying desperately to find the location of sylas  briarwood your vision pulls back and is thrust past the titan and theres a flash of movement  youre suddenly seeing trees youre sensing somewhere in the thick forest of the vasper  timberlands and there you focus on rapidly flapping bat wings  marisha still trying to get back hes still trying to get back  matt you /none/ dont know hes in the forest somewhere hes in a deep forest with bits of snow  around him and youre only catching glimpses of it as he goes through the shadowed underbrush  marisha no type of landmark  matt just trees endless trees  laura hes running away  taliesin i would run if i were him  sam deal with him another day  marisha hes in the vasper forest  liam well well never see him again  taliesin he may finally have had enough  marisha do you ever think theres a chance for lady /none/ briarwood to come back  laura i dont think so  travis and liam never say never  taliesin never say never but probably not  laura i mean if we can bring people back they might be able to  travis thats a good point  taliesin he would have to work very hard to make it happen  travis were going to live a life of paranoia arent we  taliesin well we knew that going in  sam well be okay  laura so do we go see the leaders here  sam yeah lets go  /none/ taliesin lets go see whos left  matt all right  sam to the platinum temple  matt as you guys are having this conversation around the corner you see theres a few of the  eagle riders that are getting on their eagle back and flying off there is one figure that stays  behind and that turns around and begins to walk your direction in the chaos you hadnt noticed  that when vecna had been dispelled the force cage that had maintained and locked in jmon sa ord had  vanished you see them turn around and /none/ look towards you in humanoid form they approach with  the long jetblack hair the darkened skin the beautiful coallike ember eyes tall almost as  tall as grog though lithe in form and simply clothed jmon approaches well im certainly  impressed i apologize to have not been as much help as i had hoped  laura that was a shitty spell he cast  matt it seems to be his forte nonetheless the least i can do is offer you a way into the city  travis that would be lovely  matt i would like to speak /none/ with the council that remains as well come with me jmon turns  around and steps about 20 feet away before the wings sprout out of their back and stretch to each  side you see the large brass dragon form expand the claws impact onto the ground as they turn  their head back over their shoulder the deep voice of the dragon form hop on  laura im going to hold on to velora and trinket i swear its going to be the last time  buddy im not going to keep making you go in this necklace /none/ much more  matt bear grunts licks the side of your cheek and closes his eyes waiting for it  laura ooh i love him so much  matt into the necklace  liam and as vax and keyleth get situated on jmons back i whisper in her ears i was going  to say eagle giant eagle  marisha yeah thats good to know  travis i pick up pike and put her on my shoulders get on the dragon  matt okay pike climbs up now wingless thank you grabs onto the belt you have across your chest /none/  travis yeah  matt all right so do you all climb up onto jmons back  sam absolutely  matt all right jmon in devossa form then begins to run at a fast speed towards the edge of  the city eventually the wings begin to flap and with one giant thrust of wind ascends and once  again you feel the wind rocket through your hair as was your entry towards the titan you begin to  crest over the edge of thar amphala over the titan and down towards the center of vasselheim  the wind roaring /none/ past your face your cloaks whipping behind you you have a birdseye view of  the city that youve essentially saved and really did so through a quick jaunt to the  feywild  the braving grounds still while in severe disarray and flames still burn most everythings  under control now whatever remains of the remnant cultists warriors and undead have either been  destroyed captured or run out of the city as you pick up 40 50 feet over the rooftops you see  as hundreds of survivors have haphazardly armed bastions as civilians of vasselheim have picked /none/  up whatever arms were available of soldiers in the streets children holding the hands of their  families all glance up and point at the majestic brass dragon that coasts not more than maybe 40  50 feet ahead signifying once more a symbol of hope and victory you hear the shouts behind you  as you begin to make your way around the heavens stair mountain and then up gliding over the steps  leading up towards the platinum sanctuary  as you begin to glide up you can see the steps are littered with broken bone splatters /none/ of  blood broken bodies and silvered armor and familiar black sludge connoting the remains of  slain gloomstalkers the immediate ground conflict is over here and has been for some time the  stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop  the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform itself before you approach the entryway in the  pillars as you ascend floating up devossa lands right at the top of the stair as all the  soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling the wounded /none/ gathering the dead all stop and look  at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off  as you do you watch as the chatter the conversation the quiver of worry the intensity  of the recovery comes to stillness as each of the soldiers even those who have seen better days  stand up with a look of acknowledgment greeting you as you arrive and all give a respectful bow  of the head or kneel to you as you approach and pass by in the stillness you /none/ begin to walk  towards the opening of the sanctuary the doors open already and glance over your shoulder to see  that jmon has retaken their human form and is now walking at your side  entering the sanctuary you can see folks are rushing around a bit and they notice your  arrival as well but are also trying to make sure that everything is accounted for and theres a  bit of hustle and bustle the old scalebearer yon who greeted you first to vasselheim approaches  quickly oh goodness me hello youre well youve looked better /none/ but so have we thats fine  i have questions to ask but perhaps its best that come with me and darts back towards the  central meeting chambers of the platinum sanctuary you can see the circle of pillars that  surround the wide marbled floors of the center chamber where all these council meetings have  previously taken place you can see battle has taken place here while most of the bodies or the  wounded or dead have been removed at this point you can see there are elements of chipped and  broken stone and marble /none/ you can see scattered remains and blood stains at points towards the  entryway but most of it appears to have been halted at the entryway all of the combat has  halted within the sanctuary glancing past you can see most of the council you met last is not  here theyre probably handling their various portions of the city but you do see amongst a  number of inner guardians of the sanctuary highbearer vord who himself looks like hes seen  a bit of a fray and allura vysoren to his side both harried but alive as /none/ soon as you begin to  approach their conversation comes to a halt as allura turns and sees you all her face brightens  and she immediately rushes up tossing any sort of formalities to the side and runs up before she  can give you a hug she sees the child in your arms  laura shes all right  matt im so glad  marisha yeah group hug  matt she pulls you in and you all bundle into this big group hug heaving breaths of relief  cascade through your grouping you hear the throat clear behind /none/ as vord goes clears throat  travis decorum  laura hows kima  matt i assume shes well shes been doing what she does best which is wander the streets  destroying things that she doesnt like ive been keeping a close eye from a distance as best i can  she seems all right  taliesin any word from gilmore in the last hour  matt no why  marisha he was in the tower he was a decoy we almost slayed him  laura hed been taken  liam and taliesin hes all right  sam do we /none/ know where he teleported off to  marisha we sent him off with cassandra  taliesin into the woods  laura into the wood  sam dont worry its a big woods itll be okay  liam this city still stands you have carried out a miracle  matt ive done nothing word seems to and at that point she gets cut off by highbearer vord  who steps forward his arms crossed word seems to have spread and i wish not to celebrate  prematurely i have reports that you were there that you did battle with this ancient /none/ beast what  is your assurance what is your confidence that this is indeed over and were not lulled into a  false sense of security  travis were pretty sure hes alive and well you know hes a threat right now whispering what  do we have proof  laura oh proof  taliesin ive never known a true sense of security im not entirely sure  sam the proof is were here and were alive  laura and that titan has stopped moving  liam i am the champion of the raven queen and she has allowed me /none/ to track his every movement for  a while now  matt i recall you mentioning that when we last met  liam hes gone  travis there was a process we had trammels  laura you remembered the word  travis yes  marisha do i still have the remains of the broken trammel or did it shatter  matt no that shit shattered it turned to dust  laura yeah glitter bomb oh glitterbomb vecna i like the idea that he got glitterbombed  matt that was my good eye  laughter  matt all right you see /none/ as you guys are discussing the highbearers eyes lock to vaxs  and you see softness return to his face the tension the unknowing begins to subside with a  smile comes across his stilted older elvish visage you all there was a time i did not look past your  beginnings i am ashamed at my misjudgment he looks around as folks begin to gather he  acknowledges jmon whos approached theyve bowed carefully many heroes rose to challenge  this day many weve lost and many others that remain to remember them let us vow to never  /none/ forget those who gave everything so that we could still stand here to remember you vox machina  stand as that beacon of hope upon which we all we hold you may not fully understand the scope of  what you have done but i assure you we do and we will we humble of vasselheim are eternally in  your debt as is much of the ignorant world perhaps on behalf of silver talons reach i  thank you for everything  the rest of the room whos begun to gather now you see other soldiers that were waiting /none/ outside  as you first approached have begun to filter in and as you glance back towards the entry hallway of  the platinum sanctuary you see faces people that greeted you in people hearing these words  resounding in silence and they all begin to bow low  laura this is weird  sam should we say something  travis ask for money  laura they havent done our fees right  marisha im supremely uncomfortable  sam you are the leader of your people maybe you should say something  marisha what  sam youre a leader  /none/ marisha no but im not a leader of these people  laura youve been giving us really good inspirational speeches get up and say something  taliesin get up and say something  laura say something really awesome  taliesin just tell people it was brilliant and great  marisha okay i step forward  matt so as you stand here amongst this procession of warriors people that now look up and dont see  keyleth the druid they see the voice of the tempest they see one of the  astoprobablyberemembered saviors of the city and beyond all eyes /none/ are on you as highbearer vord  steps away  liam im still holding your hand  marisha chuckles sighs the bravery of vasselheim remains evident on this day and you  all should be proud that your reputation of a city unfallen by invasion or attack remains and that  is only because of the faith and the bravery and the strength of the citizens of this amazing city  we of vox machina are proud and honored to have fought by every single one of you and we vow to  continue to stand by your side through /none/ the rest of our days huzzah  all huzzah  cheering  ashley hey can you hear me  matt with a wave of cheers that roar from within these marbled halls that echo boom and  reverberate  marisha to 1000 years of vasselheim huzzah  matt cheers and cries and fists raise and pikes cheering  ashley yay  laughter  matt you see velora pull away from alluras arm whos come by to help you carry her and she  weakly yay and allura looks to you with an absolute look of respect and pride even the /none/  highbearer seems to be taken by the words shit everyone in the room gets temporary hit points  practically  marisha yeah 20 hit points now  matt the sunglass roof which currently has been sitting within the shadow of the mountain the  sunlight begins to peak past and glide its way across the marble floor as everyones  cheering and the room now which once was in shadow of the mountain is now lit up with  sunlight now you can see the glittering armor that peeks through the dirt the grime the blood  shining and /town/ sparkling on each of you across pikes beautiful armor across all the warriors  that stand here across the scalebearers design across your hair the room is filled with light  and though you sense the presence of probably bahamut glancing down you cant help but think  that this is also the approving glance of pelor perhaps a bit of the everlight as the cheers  begin to fade the crowd begins to pull away conversations progress thankyous are given  people come up to you and eventually you guys begin to step out of the sanctuary and there /dung/ you  look down across the upper platform looking down over the city you can see the birthheart the  duskmeadow pillars of smoke rising up as the sun now hangs high in the sky  a cold sensation takes you in the chest vax a small pain  a second one and your eyes shoot over across to the ravens crest damaged but still standing you  turn around to look at the rest of your family and as you guys look at his face in but a flash you  can see this dark shape behind him this /dung/ looming black cloak this lithe dress that cascades down  into a bell and drags across the ground and there you see the form of the raven queen porcelain  mask long dark hair behind as her hands slowly creep over the shoulders of vaxildan  taliesin i walk to step in between  matt in between the two of them  taliesin yes  matt while the lips do not move on this mask the voice in your head says youve done well but do  not approach this is not for you  marisha no  taliesin do /none/ you recall what you told me once  matt no response do you continue to walk  taliesin i do  matt make a wisdom saving throw  liam percy  taliesin no no thats actually you know what hey thats right im going to resolve that  liam freddie  taliesin this is not about you thats a 19 22  matt that does not do it  taliesin damn it i have a 19  matt i know muscles lock into place and you find yourself held there on your third step the voice  which is omnipresent /none/ in your mind all about continues soothing cold distant but still  soothing the mask slowly looks down towards you you have done well my champion the skein of  destiny has tugged in your wake and even this victory culminates with the crossing of a few  fatetouched souls by your hand your bravery your sacrifice you ensure a future for all you  love and all who will come to love you and what youve done you may never know the import of your  time here but take solace in the knowledge that you will see the /none/ ripples of your actions carry  hope for generations to come my vaxildan it is time say your goodbyes then come join my side  and the hands pull away she stands there  sam now we dont even get a night together or anything  marisha its not fair  laura weve got a really long time to be alive youve got an infinite time whats a few more years  marisha he sacrificed himself in your name you remain the only ascended and yet he still loses  matt he does not lose the gifts i gave indeed /none/ all of your patrons gave were so that you and  you watch as her hands extend almost impossibly long around her and everyone here still stands  i understand selfishness i understand the impulse of mortality but i would hope that you understand  that the actions that youve allowed vaxildan in this sacrifice are far larger but we made a deal  with power comes a price  marisha im not ready  liam youre ready for your people  marisha not without

thank you  matt and he turns and walks towards the darkened cloak of his matron in the darkness of her cloak  you see a brief light and its brighter for you as you walk forward you see reaching from the  light the dark hair the fair skin and the wide smile of your mother elaina as she greets you  she says im so proud  the rest of you watch as her cloak begins /none/ to fade like a slowly scattered shadow in creeping  sunlight and as the snowdrop flowers continue with each step you blink  and its just feathers  were going to take a break well be back here in a few minutes guys heavy exhale still more of  this story to tell see you guys in a bit  break  matt hello everyone and welcome back so before we jump back in our winner in the chat of the  giveaway is mister milgram congratulations danoba will reach out to you and get your contact  information and /none/ get your prize sent off to you so well done all right so bringing us back in  taliesin no  sam something feels different about the table  matt yeah as the cold wind subsides and the feathers glide through the wind off the edge of  the silver talons reach pinnacle of platinum sanctuary you gather your thoughts quiet creeps  over  sam i feel like i could have taken her if i had a gun im just saying  marisha scanlan have we ever told you youre an asshole  sam all the time  taliesin /none/ i use manners on scanlan  matt all right whats the save on that  taliesin wow where is it  marisha you got to sort through all your coffee stains  taliesin these are my coffee stains  marisha hes really irritable  sam jesus you have so many things  taliesin yes i do its a  laura i hug trinket  taliesin ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to my dex modifier plus my proficiency  bonus  marisha keyleth sits next to vex and lays her head on her shoulder  sam against ac /none/  taliesin against you  sam oh laughs im out  taliesin yeah thats a six 12 24 i think  matt okay and whats the or it just hits and he has to make  taliesin it just hits you can make a strength check against 20  matt to try and break out of it as an action right so as you finish your statement percival  throws an orb at you and it expands locks you up into this cage of metal bars and claws and chains  and youre locked in place unable to move  /none/ sam feels right  travis was that necessary  taliesin ill let him out when im feeling like it  travis makes sense  marisha i dont have the strength to argue with him  laura sorry scanlan  sam muffled its okay im okay in here  taliesin actually ill unlock it so he can say that  sam oh hi that was a very touching ceremony well ill just be in here crying  marisha aw  laura percy please let him out i cant take it right now  taliesin i very quickly go through scanlans pockets /dung/ to make sure theres nothing else that i  need to take back from him  matt make an investigation check  taliesin thank you nope i let him out manners  marisha that might be the last natural one of this campaign you have to scream it from a  mountaintop man  sam the golden snitch  laura how could you do that  marisha betrayal  matt its mine now  laughter  travis a celestial hand reaches out of the clouds  matt hello next campaign  laura oh shit  marisha one mans trash  /dung/ laura keyleth dear  marisha yes  laura i know it was never made official but im assuming you two wouldve spent your life  together as much of it as he had anyway  marisha he taught me how to love and i have a hard time with interpersonal relationships  laura i wouldve never known  marisha so i wouldve held onto that one for as long as i couldve and i still will  laura i still count you as my sister  marisha as i count you as mine going to have to look out for /none/ each other now  laura yes  taliesin im going to quietly wander outside  matt youre on the platform outside  taliesin oh im going to break off for a second  marisha also fuck that raven bitch  laura shes terrible  marisha what the fuck  laura you know we have a temple to her in whitestone i mean heres the thing though i  feel like i want to destroy it because i hate her so much but at the same time i feel like we  should leave it because maybe we can talk to /none/ him through it well try it  travis pike  ashley yeah  travis while were here i feel like if bahamut is the natural enemy of tiamat i dont know if i  want to be bound to this sword for much longer i feel like my time of hunting vecna is done i feel like  we have arkhans hand maybe if we handed it over to the platinum these people  ashley okay yeah  travis then somebody else could take up that hunt right  ashley if thats what you want grog i dont think thats /none/ a bad idea  travis yeah okay i think i want to turn over this sword but would you stay with me  ashley of course i will  travis hes very persuasive actually scanlan  will you come with me also  sam absolutely  travis all right can i make my way back towards somebody officiallooking  matt that would be either highbearer vord or the one you met earlier  travis highbearer orb sounds good  matt as you step back into the platinum sanctuary the voice creeps in your head i know  not what youre /none/ thinking but know together we are more powerful than anyone whos wielded me we  could take him down we could destroy it all you cannot you will not discard me  travis anyone ever stronger than anyone thats ever wielded you  matt anyone whos ever wielded me together we could bring down anything that bears his title  anyone who pursues his power  ashley grog  travis yeah  ashley whats he saying  travis sighs you make a really good point were really strong together and unstoppable  matt you feel this pulse in your brain /none/ theres a flash vision of the hand once held in your  grasp swollen atop the actual body of vecna in the battle your vision comes back and  that urge in your belly creeps up  travis i mean hold on pike maybe we could do a lot of good we could really rid the world of a  lot of bad stuff  ashley listen we did that before you knew this sword were all strong together you were strong  before it and youll be strong after it  travis exhales okay strained highbearer orb a moment /none/ please  matt as you enter the chamber once more the highbearer turns around yes grog strongjaw  what do you require  travis i would like to make a deposit  matt go on  travis i have on my person the sword  matt make a wisdom saving throw  travis okay 14  matt the words dont escape your mouth and you realize this was a bad idea  travis sighs im so sorry to waste your time i wanted to thank you for hosting us bidet and i  start to turn and walk out  /none/ ashley i grab him by the hand so he cant go anywhere  sam are you not doing this grog  travis its a bad idea  matt we could do so much together we can destroy anyone whos ever thought to pray to the now  undying king sealed away we could wipe his presence from this planet  travis strained together we could do so much we could dry eraserboard the planet  sam whatever your wishes are grog ill go along with it if you wish to keep the sword thats  fine with me  travis /none/ i want to keep it  sam great  ashley scanlan i dont think this is a good idea  sam okay sell me on this  ashley look at him  sam hes just flexing his face muscles  ashley hes getting all weird  travis strained i want to keep it  sam no he does this when he needs to go poo ive seen him do it  ashley i know he definitely does this when he needs to go poo but this is so much worse  sam i mean its been a hard day i /none/ think we all need a really good bowel movement  travis i start walking out of the sanctuary  matt pike make a strength check  ashley no yes  matt so roll and add your strength modifier which i think is four  ashley its five  matt oh its five  laura shes got the gauntlets on  matt gauntlets bring it to 19 so itll be a plus four im pretty sure  ashley wait i think i had a plus one somewhere  sam did you get some boon or boost or something  ashley with /none/ a plus four its 17  matt 17 grog roll a strength check  laura roll a one roll a one  travis 19  matt 19 pike your feet begin to scrape against the marble as grogs form and strength which is  just a little bit more than you hes a little more monster than your monster right now  ashley can i swing my other hand up and try to pull more  matt ill allow you one more strength check with disadvantage  sam really conflicted here  travis strained i want to help the planet /none/  sam he seems totally normal to me  ashley 14  matt grog roll another strength check  travis 15  matt still your metal boots are scraping across the marble as youre pulling and trying to hold  him back as hes walking out the room the voice says yes together the two of us  travis strained just the two of us we can make it if we try just the two of us kas and i  matt highbearer vord says is everything all right  sam pike do you want me to try to stop /none/ him whats going on  ashley i think this is not a good idea grog this is something you wanted to do you need to  fight it  travis can i try and fight it  matt you already lost at the moment so yeah hes currently locked into that mindset  sam pike should i do something or no  ashley well i think we could both do something but i want grog to fight this  sam why dont i help him fight it i will cast suggestion on grog using my last level two spell  /dung/ and suggest that he think long and hard about maybe fighting back against this sword one more time  ashley then if it doesnt work i have an idea  matt all right so bringing up suggestion here make a wisdom saving throw grog  travis 11  matt 11 okay as the suggestion creeps through your mind the familiar voice of scanlan through  your ears gives you just enough moment of pause to allow you an additional saving throw against the  influence  travis maybe ill take mine is it a wisdom saving throw  matt yes /none/ it is  travis thats a five  taliesin my god were saved  matt the suggestion does not seem to take hold and hes now dragged pike almost back to the  entryway of the platinum sanctuary and the highbearer is still looking a bit confused  sam hes made his choice  ashley no grog stop just one moment  travis okay i stop  ashley and i look him in the eyes i cast greater restoration still have another slot left will  that work  matt i would like you to go ahead and make a /none/ wisdom check this is contested against the wisdom  of the sword  ashley im casting it at 7thlevel because thats all i have left  matt you know what its not going to have much of an effect on this really unfortunately but  the spells cast so roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier  marisha youre smarter than a sword  ashley do i get an advantage  matt unfortunately no in the circumstance just roll a d20 and add your wisdom modifier which i  believe is a five  ashley i have yeah its /none/ five so nine  marisha and sam oh  matt well laughs  ashley you die  matt yeah you actually die no thats not worth it its fine  sam vax comes back and kills you  matt yeah i rolled a seven and he has a wisdom modifier of plus one  laura oh shit  marisha oh my god you did it  matt like i legitimately thats pretty stupid  taliesin did you use my die  matt no i did not use your die i used my purple one im saving yours for the next /none/ campaign so as  the strength of wills between the cleric and the sword begin to combat the warmth of pikes  friendship and the force of sarenraes guidance washes through your body and the cold steel of the  sword begins to warm to the touch and for a brief minute it gets so warm its hot it burns your  fingertips and you instinctively throw the blade to the ground it clatters and slides about 15  feet from you spiralling and sparking across the marble floor the highbearers foot catches it in  place he leans forward /none/ now im certainly curious  travis deep breath it is the sword of kas  matt you watch as the color begins to somewhat return to grogs face his eyes returning to their  natural pigment the sallow sunken features of his body begin to fill out once more the  influence of the blade having left his psyche and physicality  ashley oh youre back to light gray again you look great  travis im feeling so achy what happened whew  ashley you made a decision and i felt it was the right thing to do  travis /none/ yeah we kept the sword right  ashley yeah its there  sam theyre holding it for you  travis oh okay  matt at this point you can see two of the other scalebearer guardians have flanked the sides of  the highbearer as he removes his foot from the blade and steps back they both carefully lift it  with a gauntlet and present it before him and he glances down so you say this blade aided you  travis yes that blade careful with it very powerful he is bent on the destruction of one thing  /none/ and one thing only vecna  matt good to know well keep this within our vaults in case the day or time arises  travis wait i have something else then i show the hand of arkhan  matt yes it flops limply in your grasp  travis oh the person that owned this hand okay stay with me chopped this off and took  vecnas hand and stuck it on and then this got left over so this is not his hand anymore and the  one that he does have is vecnas so if you use your noodle /none/ you can use this to trace him  matt there are limitations to the use of such objects it may be of some aid to us but the  knowledge of this individual is far more important however we will accept this thing  and he ushers his hand forward and another servant comes forward and retrieves the hand from you and  folds the fingers up and places it within a small pillow backs away  ashley i think that was a great idea  travis yeah right it was pretty smart  ashley yes it was very smart /none/  matt what was the name of this this current wielder of the hand of vecna  travis arkin arkeen  sam arkhan  travis arkhan arkhan the fool the cruel the  sam misguided  matt arkhan the misguided  travis dont underestimate him hes really buff and devious  sam and hes got another hand that he could chop off too one in reserve  matt very well so well begin to do research and seek out this arkhan the cruel  travis cool yeah he was pretty cool he was pretty cool  sam i was fighting /none/ a god i didnt really catch his name  travis well see dont hurt him he actually helped us defeat vecna he pulled a tricksydoodle  and took the hand  matt i would do whatever it takes to not trust individuals who would steal such an artifact with  their own means  travis sure  matt well find this individual rest assured the will of bahamut turned on him now i doubt  hell find a place to hide thank you very much  travis yep beep beep all right pike shall we away  ashley we shall /none/ away  travis scanlan shall we away  sam away we shall  travis away we oui oui  ashley and sam oui oui  sam travis and ashley bidet  matt bidet as you exit the sanctuary you meet up with the rest of your friends that are still  taking their quiet moments of reflection on the exterior platform on the outside of the sanctuary  overlooking the eastern side of vasselheim  ashley how do you feel  travis i feel good i feel like pursuing vecna was something that we all did together and i feel /none/  like whatever we do now is new and i felt like i was going to have to do that on my own and i dont  want to do that  laura grog you wouldnt have to do anything on your own  travis thats good to know  laura yeah were in this together  sam ive got a thing actually ive got to get to  laura can i walk over to percy are you still over by yourself  taliesin well yeah ill take care of something im sitting in a corner and im staring into /none/ the  reflection of my sword and im gently tapping the contract in my pocket and im going to say  ipkesh  laura no im going to sit down next to you  taliesin youre too late youve been doing a thing could you bring him back would it the  thing that you gave me bring him back  matt theres no answer  taliesin hmm nothing at all all right  laura now im going to sit down next to you how are you  taliesin i have no idea i think i really miss my family /none/ i think i miss my sisters and my parents  i think i was going to be a clockmaker once i havent thought about that there was a moment do  you remember when we met  laura i do  taliesin i for a brief time thought that i had died within that prison and i was having a fever  dream from starvation and this was what that felt like was my mind making stories of friends and  adventures and these things i would never do because i was a coward and fool i miss my family /none/  so much and ive done some terrible things i gave grog that sword  laura you did  taliesin it didnt feel real  laura now it does  taliesin i dont know this is new im sorry  laura what were you going to do are you going to fight the raven queen for me  taliesin many years ago i went to make a deal with her and she told me that i was broken and  that i had always been broken part of me was going to save your brother and really i just  /none/ wanted to prove it to her i wanted to hurt her for hurting me  laura i think were all broken percy  taliesin i am so tired of hurting people  laura you dont have to hurt anyone anymore  taliesin i love you very much  laura i love you  taliesin this has been a terrible day  laura its horrible  taliesin wheres kiki wheres scanlan i think i owe him an apology oh god i owe grog an apology  maybe ill not apologize to grog that sounds like a really terrible idea  laura /none/ darling  taliesin yes  laura youre a good person and youre not broken anymore all right well filling each others  gaps well be the glue  taliesin thank you  laura and dont do anything crazy anymore no deals with raven queens all right lets not  fight any more gods  taliesin i was going to say lets destroy the one in whitestone maybe we could seal it up  leave it because you know but  laura i want to see if i can talk to him through it is that stupid  taliesin how would /none/ i know seems worth a shot im too tired to be angry  laura we did a thing today a pretty big thing  taliesin was that today it legitimately feels like a week ago at this point  laughter  taliesin its been a long day yeah well rejoin sorry about manners that was rude  sam are you apologizing for something  taliesin yes  sam thats stupid  taliesin i know  sam i never said sorry for leaving  taliesin yeah but youre you you dont have to apologize we just assume  sam well im /none/ sorry sorry i left  taliesin i will not accept it so that when you come to your senses later you dont feel like  youve compromised but thank you  laughter  sam thats fair  travis you handing out apologies  taliesin no yes sorry about the skull  marisha oh im pretty sure you just handed out an apology after you just said you werent going  to hand out an apology  taliesin im a human im made of contradictions you people wouldnt understand  marisha i think percy is a walking contradiction  travis i /none/ will consider accepting your apology if you tell me whatever happened to it  taliesin sighs oh my god i legitimately dont remember  marisha i thought wait we  matt at that point two hands drape around the side of grogs shoulder up top and vex as the long  golden braids down the arms of allura vysoren says my friend grog best not to worry about it  wherever it is its beyond our grasp now  travis okay allura  laughter  marisha did you just sitcom mug okay allura  laughter  matt if we couldve /none/ freezeframed and rolled credits on that to end the campaign i would have been  happy laughs allura takes her hands back then reaches over and musses up the side of pikes  hair sighs weve been through quite a bit together havent we  laura so much  matt lot of ups and downs  marisha you were quite an inspiration allura i hope you know you inspired me quite a lot  matt im only doing what everybody else is doing in this world make it up as you go along  marisha we know a lot about /none/ that allura is vasselheim going to be looking for members to join  the council  matt vasselheim what do you mean vasselheim is mostly a religious council if you know  marisha totally  matt i could put in a word but i didnt  consider this really your type of  marisha no right  matt here  sam shes asking for somebody else im pretty sure she wasnt asking for her  marisha i actually was actually  matt oh i can inquire  marisha i was thinking pike but i dont know  matt if i /none/ do recall you have a temple here one that you pretty much built  taliesin how is that temple right now  matt thats a very good question pike would you like to go see your temple  ashley i would like to go see my temple  matt very well she waves her fingers a bit and casts fly on all of you  laura oh shit on everybody  matt on a high enough level you can  ashley whoa  travis pike go upside down wookiee growl  laura that was the best wookiee noise youve ever /none/ made babe  taliesin that was a really good wookiee noise  travis mediocre wookiee growl  matt retracted immediately as she was here helping defend she didnt waste her 8thlevel  slot she is able to get you guys all flying for the moment and you all coast as she finishes  casting the spell you could see some of the nearby wardens of the platinum sanctuary go  um i know its arcane shut up its fine you all take off the steps and begin to glide down  over to the city and there you can already /none/ see people are coming out of their homes exactly so  eventually you find your way north to the quadroads towards the base of the heaven stair  mountain where the temple resides the temple looks like its sustained a little bit of damage it  looks like a portion of the upper floor of the threetier tower colosseumesque but it does  taper a bit towards the top the top part has partially fallen in and it looks like its seen wear  and tear but it doesnt look like its been destroyed or anything as you come up /none/ to the  temple you can already see there are refugees of homes that were destroyed from the incursion of  the braving grounds that are being gathered in and the temples filled with people on the outside  you see gesyra the older woman who helped you found the temple and build it as she  approaches shes now one of the priests of rebirth and has been working with you for some  time and turns and sees your face you can see her graying hair which is bunned up very tightly in  the back she has /none/ her spectacles and she has the long robes of blue and gold she sees you my  pike she rushes up and gives you a hug shes much bigger than you being a human but her  posture puts her almost on your level im so glad youre safe  ashley its so wonderful to see your face  matt weve housed who we can were a bit at capacity at the moment  ashley okay well it looks a bit better than i thought it would  matt we did our best to defend is it done  ashley /none/ its done  matt you see her eyes crack at that moment and tears begin to flow she smiles i knew you could  do it  ashley well we all did  matt she looks around at the rest of you pats you on the head for a minute and pulls away and  goes you get to wear the greatest outfits dont you  ashley giggles  matt well anything you need food we have room for a few more  sam i would suggest that we theres bars here right in vasselheim they drink dont they  /tavern/ matt oh yeah theres bars here  marisha maybe they do a dry city after a certain time  matt are you kidding me religion and alcohol go together perfectly thats a timehonored  tradition  sam why dont we go find a tavern somewhere and let these people pick up the pieces and give them  their space  marisha do you need any type of water or anything we can immediately assist you with  matt clean water would be wonderful  marisha do you have somewhere to put it  matt just a moment and she goes /none/ inside for a moment and calls out four of the other lower  acolytes of sarenraes temple and they all have various buckets and reservoirs  marisha i burn as many create water spells as it takes to fill them up  matt they bring you inside where theres the large statue of sarenrae where you had your first  vision that called you to come find her and there is a fountain as part of that and a reservoir in  the bottom that has currently been mostly emptied to facilitate everyone here who needed water or to  /none/ clean wounds you help fill that and you very very quickly manage to get the temple back to an  easily sustainable level  taliesin pike  ashley yes  taliesin i could use your assistance i dont think i should have this and i need this to be  taken away from me before i do something foolish and i hand pike my contract  ashley sighs i take it percy what is this  taliesin this i thought was proof that i was in control of myself but its just a terrible thing  waiting to happen  /none/ sam ashley i just texted you the contract  taliesin thank you how do you have it on autosave do you just have it  sam yeah  ashley i mean i somewhat know what it is  taliesin i dont think it can be destroyed but maybe it can be put far away  ashley i will keep this at the very least very far from you  taliesin i have every faith in you thank you i think im done with that  sam pike i have a porno book that i really think i shouldnt have anymore /tavern/ can i give it to you to  take it away  taliesin ill take it away  sam oh youll take it okay  travis i would like to bid on it as well yeah i have some money still  sam its not great  taliesin can you text it to us actually  ashley could you text me the book  sam sure  taliesin thats a three jpeg man sorry  matt so you guys go off to find a tavern and drink together  travis yeah  sam yeah we need to go have some /none/ toasts to vax  laura and marisha yeah  matt all right  laura you said allura took velora  matt yeah well at this point shes probably still carrying her with you  laura oh okay i thought you said allura took her away okay  matt yeah because allura took her off of you you know what no shes probably being tended to  at the platinum sanctuary at the moment seeing to her wounds  laura did i just leave her i feel weird just leaving her  marisha shell be fine shell be safe  travis /none/ shes in some pretty solid hands  laura ill run back and talk to her  matt okay so you head back into the sanctuary and retrieve her  laura im going to make sure her wounds were tended because she was pretty busted up  matt she was thankfully there are a number of clerics and healers available that can take a  moment away from the wounded of the battle to deal with a little girl and when you come to her  shes still a bit battered and bruised but shes all right  laura is there /none/ anyone who can send me to syngorn  taliesin why doesnt she stay with us for a while  matt youre asking this of anybody at the temple  laura do you think we should  sam we can take a day  taliesin i think maybe a little time spent in our company as opposed to your fathers company  would not be the worst idea  laura maybe a message of sending can anyone do that pike do you have the message of sending  sam to whom  laura to my father  marisha to let him /none/ know that his daughter is still alive  ashley i dont have it with me but i  laura okay allura youve done it before  matt yes  laura could you send something to my father  matt i could i could also bring her there if youd like  laura no velora would you want to go home right now  matt right now shes holding onto your neck a bit she looks at you i miss you  laura i miss you too  matt can i stay a bit longer  laura okay  matt okay /none/  taliesin i think thats a great idea  laura i think so too allura will you say that velora is safe and that ill be paying a visit  very soon to return her  matt i believe that and for a moment she looks just beyond your eyes squints hes aware  laura thank you  matt so to drinks  laura and taliesin to drinks  matt i dont really drink but after a day like today i think i need one  travis yeah  laura apple juice for you little one  matt she giggles /tavern/ in your ear all right  laura im bringing my sister to a bar  sam your nearly dead sister  marisha yeah shes going to have to be introduced at some point  matt yeah allura takes a moment and squints her eyes for a second apparently sending another  message and then nodding she leads you guys towards the quadroads and finds a pub called the  quarrys end and its not too far from sarenraes temple which is why she chose it and it looks to  be like it was near a quarry that was built /tavern/ into the mountain that either dried up or was closed  down for some reason and then a tavern was opened instead as a means of still making money its  super divey it smells of stained wood and spilled wine its musty and perfect and as you  all come in its mostly empty as people are still in the process of trying to figure things  out the few that are in there appear to be wounded soldiers that as opposed to getting  medical help are in the process of drinking themselves into a numb state but /tavern/ you find a  table you sit down one of the barmaids comes up to you goes drinking away the fray are you  taliesin i put like 20 gold on the table  matt oh  taliesin we will take the cheapest worst beer you have and a round for everyone in the bar  matt but of course sir my pleasure takes the coin  taliesin if everyones all right with that  laura of course dear  travis can i also start pulling out the remaining eight expensiveass bottles of wine from the bag  of holding /tavern/  marisha hell yeah drunk as shit nows the time  matt within moments your table is covered in terrible beer and really expensive wine  travis expensiveass  laura thats what you wrote down too  travis expensiveass bottles of wine  matt you pull two tables together and you guys are in the process youre a fair bit into your  cups and then the somewhat ajar door on the exterior slams open as the light filters in from  the outside and there you see standing the general halfheight of an armored halfling  partially bloodied armor /none/ dented as shit  travis and marisha kima  matt kima as she walks in sauntering in with her blade being sheathed in the back  of her giant scabbard her holy avenger got your message honey not going to pass up a drink after a  day like this cracking ow ow ow she comes and sits down next to allura and puts her arm  around her real fast this is new and points to the drink in front of allura  taliesin its a special occasion  marisha were bad influences  travis yeah desperate times and /none/ all that  matt good i guess thats why were friends  marisha i see youre working the late shift  matt well you know when theres streets crawling with skeletons i got to be there  taliesin been having a good time then  matt oh its been amazing its been terrible terrible but amazing  marisha well we frontloaded our hours  laura can we have another cup  matt yeah the barmaid comes by gets another cup and leaves you guys all to drink and swap stories  taliesin that thing that i was bugging you about /dung/  marisha which one you bug me about a lot of things  taliesin well thats fair now that i have a bit of alcohol in me  marisha yeah and you ask me after i have a bit of alcohol in me and i scry on cassandra  matt okay  taliesin oh god he flipped a page i hate that  matt you take a long deep sip of your drink and then close your eyes as you complete the scrying  ritual youve halfscrawled on the dark wood wall on the side of the tavern your vision /none/ goes  cloudy and you feel yourself being transitioned rapidly through wind and cloud as the temperature  of your atmosphere begins to drop and there you begin to break cloud cover to look down upon  whitestone  your vision jumps once more to the exterior of the castle jumps once more and there you see lying  in bed covers pulled up to her chest with at least three different servants and one medical  personnel there at her side bag open tending to her wounds shes asleep but shes breathing  marisha looks like shes been tended /tavern/ to like a proper de rolo  laura did you see kaylie and gilmore  marisha did i see kaylie and gilmore  matt not in the room no  taliesin she made it back to whitestone one would assume thats how she got there  marisha she was not doing well gilmore was the most ablebodied im assuming he got her there i hope  taliesin im sure i have faith  marisha ill scry on the rest of them tomorrow  taliesin im drunk dont get used to it  marisha and taliesin faithless until the end  /none/ marisha thank you percy  percy thank you keyleth  marisha you taught me just the right amount of how to be a shithead just enough  sam we should toast to vaxildan our fallen member  matt at which point kima goes yeah where is that asshole anyway  sam hes really stealthy  matt aint that the truth all right she grabs her cup  laura apple juice  matt shes holding a cup  sam what do you have ashley  ashley i have a cup and its a vintage cup i dont need to talk about /none/ this  laughter  matt glasses raised and at this point as the glasses are raised you can hear whispers off to  the side you glance over and you can see one of the nearby tables which is filled with four  bastions who had been drinking to the battle and have now taken notice and seemingly recognized  whos at the table across the way theyre all staring and they all grab their glasses and raise  them too  laura to vaxildan he was the best of us  marisha the most selfless  sam the most /none/ frequently naked  marisha second to you  travis the most frustrating  taliesin the brightest and the darkest  sam thats true to vax  all to vax  matt so what comes next  travis what does come next  marisha sighs its hard to think after a day that feels like a week like today  laura syngorn and whitestone i would assume  taliesin home for a bit at least and of course everybody is welcome always  marisha ive got to get back to zephrah  sam do we have to check on greyskull keep /none/  laura in emon  sam i dont know  laura someone should stay there  travis we left it as an outpost i wouldnt mind going back to whitestone for a bit  taliesin ill also say for those of you especially grog you have your freedoms and if  you wanted to become lord of greystone and have a place of your own that you could invite us to as  opposed to wandering  marisha greyskull  taliesin greyskull  travis hesitant noises  laura or you could just hang in whitestone  travis ill think about /none/ it it seems like that has responsibilities  laura the grand poobah has a lot of responsibilities too  travis i do there is an updated tour  sam well go to whitestone and figure it out thats where kaylie is right we assume  laura potentially  marisha i dont think i can go back to whitestone with you  laura why  sam oh why youve got to go back to your people  marisha i have to go back to zephrah  taliesin well i think were going to need help getting to whitestone and then i /none/ think its going  to take at least a day for you to regain the power to return to your people  marisha bad influences all of you assholes  taliesin were not getting rid of you quite that easily  marisha all right one day  travis if you can bear it  marisha and then i want to not see your faces for a bit  sam sure that makes sense pikeypoo where are you going  ashley well id like to come with you guys for a little bit because frankly i dont really want to  /none/ be alone for a while  taliesin i dont think any of us do  travis i pull her into the biggest hug  ashley oh p oh grog  travis you almost called me your own name its okay youll be fine  ashley i was going to call you poobah but then i wanted to say your real name  marisha we could go back to whitestone whenever ive still got a little bit of juice left  laura youve got enough juice to get us to whitestone right now  marisha i do believe it or fucking /none/ not  travis i dont you gave us the option  marisha what  travis you said believe it or fucking not i call nope  marisha oh it was more of a rhetorical its like a trick or treat why do we still try to  explain things to him i havent learned  ashley because hes learning  matt kimas clasping her cup and goes i can watch this all day  travis thank you pike  ashley he learns something new every day  taliesin how did whitestone look  matt its blurred at a distance aside /tavern/ from the specific target of your scrying you dont get  much of a vision just an idea of the blurry exterior  laura should we drunkenly walk to the tree  sam are we transporting tonight why dont we chill for a night  laura dont you want to see your daughter  sam well of course but im drunk and bloody  marisha we can drunkenly walk there and take our time and enjoy the stars and we can oh  scanlan  sam did you have a drink  marisha scanlan  sam what can we do /none/  marisha we can do little arcane cantrips

 taliesin nothing youre fine love you very much  marisha ive lost the love of my life today im allowed to be belligerent  taliesin you are  travis are we throwing caution to the wind  sam sure  travis

he did one of them though  matt youre semiaware that theres something going on make an arcana check  taliesin oh this could go so badly  sam 15  matt 15 something creeping in the back of your mind something youve learned something youve  heard really tells you that this is powerful and chaotic  sam ill watch for now  travis youll partake  sam probably  travis three percy /tavern/  taliesin i think ive had enough for one day  sam if were going to do that we should go back to whitestone first  travis why this place is already fucked up lets get it on keyleth  marisha i am drunk enough to where im not going to stop it or argue against it but i wont  partake so thats pretty good for me  travis why are you so resistant to gifts and wonder magic  marisha grog youve had two weapons speak to you  travis dont be jelly  laura nothing powerful comes /none/ without a price we saw that we just saw that with the raven queen  power comes at a price you think that wonderful things are going to be pulled out of your hands  here and theres going to be no consequences  travis pretty much  marisha grog havent we been through enough shit to know nothings free  travis what  marisha fuck it  travis here or whitestone  taliesin oh definitely not at whitestone  travis all right pike you want one  laughter  taliesin ive always worried about the two of you  /none/ ashley well i think you should pick a card and we deal with one as of right now and then maybe  ill pick one later  travis well jeez i thought we were all having tequila shots and going crazy and taking pictures  and writing our name on the bathroom walls but it seems like everybodys lost their nerve i put it  back in the bag of holding  laughter and groaning  matt youre such an asshole  taliesin youre such a dick  laura dont do it  marisha you insult our resolve and hold /tavern/ out on us all at the same time  travis the nights still young  ashley ugh just pick one  matt all right  sam were traveling now were drunk  marisha yeah  taliesin lets drive a tree itll be fun  matt you all wander outside of the tavern find your way over to the nearest tree thats  functional it takes you a little bit because a lot of trees look thicker at a distance when  youre drunk than when you approach  marisha yeah no this one wont work no this wont work sorry /town/  taliesin thats more of a shrub  marisha sorry next one that one looks good  taliesin yes that looks nice  sam thats a young boy  taliesin oh yes  matt eventually you find the tree thatll work which is interesting because you have this  combination of people that are recognizing you as vox machina as the whispered saviors of the town  as you drunkenly stumble through the city streets naught but hours after sealing a recently ascended  god its strangely so perfect for you as you approach the tree that you find thatll /none/ work  allura has her arm over kima shes a lightweight you go on ahead we need to help here with the  construction effort  laura youve got to get your construction on  matt no were just and then kima goes yes  travis laughing she doesnt handle that booze very well  matt well see you soon travel safe and thank you  sam love you  matt okay  laughter  matt kima drags her hand kimas drank far more but is sober she can hold her liquor all right  thank you guys and grabs /none/ her hand and pulls her off and they both wave bye as they step back into  the city  you complete your spell emerging from the exterior of the sun tree back in whitestone the  comfort is here once more it seems to be just past dusk at this point  marisha slurred see when you travel wait no when you travel west to east you gain time see  sam yeah you called it  ashley time travel  marisha slurred happy hour is right now in whitestone just saying  taliesin lets head home  sam /none/ that works  marisha okay heading home works  matt you guys make your way to the castle food is presented everyones happy to see you back

or are we  breaking off  laura quietly go see your daughter  sam all right im going to go see kaylie  matt /none/ okay asking around a bit it doesnt take much to find kaylie in your old room in  whitestone the one where you both left when you first exited the group for a short time shes in  there bandaged up and looks like shes taking a dagger and throwing it into the wall then walking  over and pulling it back out sitting back on the bed and throwing it and it bounces off the hilt  hits shes like fuck picks it back up and doesnt notice you in the doorway as she sits  back down she /none/ looks over  sam hi  matt hi  sam you with a dagger in your hands always a little scary  matt why does it frighten you  sam not any  matt boo  sam yelps okay it frightens me a little  matt she sheathes

criming  matt you watch for a brief second her tough exterior break and you can see her eyes welling  up a little bit she looks at the ground for a minute then looks back up at you im glad  youre safe  sam im so happy i got to see you again i thought for a second that when we said goodbye /none/ it  was the last time  matt i didnt i know you too well at this point youre too much of a turd to die  sam thats true only good people die  matt id like to go back to ankharel i dont know if this whole meat man things for me  anymore  sam yeah no i hear you i dont know if its for me either it was fun  matt it was a lot of fun  sam it felt like we were killing time a little bit theres something else that we should /none/ do i  dont know what maybe your thing wont be my thing  matt lets find someone to pass on the mantle to eh  sam thats a good idea  matt i think the meat man should be there just not us  sam yeah thats a great idea well train a replacement  matt still take a percentage i mean we worked this hard  sam passive income right its the dream  matt its the meat and potatoes of any good business venture  sam i should have thought of that thats amazing  matt thats /none/ why the daughters an upgrade after that i dont know i hate to admit it but  sam did you finish school  matt no  sam do you want to  matt yeah  sam all right well lets do that then you go to school  matt im not really made for a lyceum we can go visit i didnt expect you to recommend  schooling  sam listen ive made a lot of mistakes in my life and i dont want you to make the same ones  i love you and i want to support you /none/ in whatever you want to do at this point my time has come  and ive done my thing and my thing is done and now i want to help you do whatever it is that you  want to do if that means i can be close to you then great but if it doesnt then ill come  visit every once in a while we made quite a bit of money as the meat man  matt aye that we did  sam and its a good sum to get started  matt would it be enough to /none/ pay for a right topend education so i can gloat over all the  other kids that are raised by the various lords and ladies of emon become one of those privileged kids  sam you can have the best education  matt thats what i want to do i want to rub it in their face  sam all right education for spite i like that  matt that sounds like a shorthalt endeavor  sam sure whatever you need  matt she stands up from the bed and walks over and puts her hand on your shoulder in /none/ a pat pat  she pulls you into a hug and rests her head on your shoulder and doesnt say anything  sam you wont have to worry about me anymore  matt im going to worry about you every day  sam thank you thank you for coming into my life  matt thank you for being enough of a shitbag to bring me into it  sam im so happy i made so many mistakes but it turns out that some of them werent mistakes  after all  matt im still young and unlearned time will tell /none/ she pulls you a little tighter in  sam ill snuggle and fall asleep in the room at some point  matt she smells the alcohol on your breath and groans go lie there im going to groans  she winces as her wound in her shoulder flares up i need some fresh air you go to sleep  exhaustion hits you and you end up passing out at the foot of the bed  sam im in my room now  matt yeah your old room  laura im going to tuck velora into bed  matt shes asleep /none/ by the time you get there travel and everything has tuckered her out you  tuck her in put the blanket up  laura i tiptoe out of the room and i find percy  taliesin ill be in cassandras room  laura percival  taliesin yes  laura could i talk to you for a moment  taliesin of course  laura i completely understand if you want to stay with cassandra for the night would you mind not being  very comfortable though i was thinking of camping in the woods  taliesin i think that sounds lovely /none/ and youre always better than comfortable i had a thought  actually my god it is hard surviving isnt it perhaps keyleth could use a friend right now and  i know that you carry one with you  laura trinket  taliesin just for a bit i think she could use a companion whos not going to apologize or give too  much sympathy  laura of course i send trinket to keyleths room  matt as trinket ascends the stairs he looks back over the shoulder questioning noise  laura she might cry a lot on you all /none/ right dear  matt makes it up the stairs  laura its going to be a lot harder to stay warm out in the woods now  taliesin well figure something out i grew up here im used to it  laura i wanted to remember how i used to camp with vax when we were kids  taliesin id like to see that  laura i guess we go out and set up a little fire  matt you guys make your way into the woods and set up a camp for the evenings rest together  keyleth are /none/ you in your room the door creaks and trinket comes in and stares right at you  slurps and licks up the side of your face your hair sticks up for a minute  marisha oh buddy  matt bear noises he leans in and plops down on the ground a giant beanbag mound of bear fur  marisha i cover trinket with snot and tears as i sob into his belly first night alone but with  trinket  taliesin best teddy bear ever  marisha aware of the gesture i cry  matt eventually the exhaustion and the /none/ alcohol hits you and you fall asleep cuddled up in the  warm embrace of a very fantastic recently meteorstruck bear  marisha drool and eyeliner and dirt  matt voice of the tempest  sam you were wearing eyeliner to our fight  marisha remember i charcoal warpainted  sam that makes sense  travis has everybody gone off  matt pike actually would still be around  travis i make my way sneakily outside  matt pike what are you doing  ashley theres a couple of things  taliesin theres a lovely tea rose garden in the /none/ back  sam shes letting grog go first  travis oh really  ashley if you wanted to go somewhere sneak away  travis oh you know i was just gonna um  matt who wants to go first pike grog whos going first  ashley just for a little bit for about an hour i want to go not deep into the woods where  percy and vex are but somewhere thats pretty for about an hour and ill make my way back  matt as youre out there on your own contemplating quietly ruminating on the day a /none/  faint howl finds the air and stepping from the shadows you see a large gray wolf galdric the  wolf that once belonged to the previous champion of the raven queen purvan who was given charge  over the forests on the outside saunters up to you he is a large wolf you are a tiny gnome he  steps up sits next to you  in this little break in the trees where you can see the moon breaking through some of the passing  clouds over whitestone the night is so cold you can see your breath /dung/ in the dark air through the  beams of moonlight that make it through the canopy as the wolf looks down at you his intense  eyes making a full scan of what you are theres a recognition to his expression the wolf looks back  up howls and gives a long baleful howl seemingly in remembrance and acknowledging that  one with a familiar path to his has found his way back to the realm of the raven queen as well  ashley you are a beautiful creature this might be strange but i give him a hug  /none/ matt you hug galdric youre used to trinket whos pretty well manicured galdric not so much  there are clusters of fur that are dirtencrusted  travis shit in them  matt probably hes not a full ruined beast he lives in the forest smells of earth dust and  nature doesnt seem to react to your hug but allows it  ashley i sit next to him  matt he seems to share the space with you for the time that youre in the forest not a strong  connection but an acknowledgement mainly focusing on the moon before /none/ it passes through the  canopy and is no longer visible  ashley i came out here to build a little something so im glad to have you out here for a  little bit thank you for staying with me  matt the one ear to the side perks open to listen to your statement but the vision doesnt meet  yours still focused in space as it fades you get the essence that the wolf acknowledges you  ashley sighs i feel like grog would be so happy right now to be around a wolf i give him /none/ a  scratch behind his ear  matt he actually seems to enjoy it and gives into it one of the giant hind legs of the wolf  ashley oh thats a good boy i give out a little howl  matt he howls along with you howls  ashley that was for my friend vax  matt the wolf gets up circles you once and makes his way into the darkness of the forest once more  ashley goodbye after a bit i head back  matt okay grog  travis i wander outside where im by myself do /none/ i see anyone  matt make a perception check  travis like it matters oh 17  matt glancing about there are some of the pale guard around nobody that you would be looking  for necessarily you seem to be open to do as you please  sam yeah  travis i pull a card  sam yes  taliesin im so proud of you  marisha wait where are you  laura outside of the castle  marisha in the middle of fucking whitestone  matt oh my god grog  ashley wait as im walking back do /none/ i see him at all  matt chuckles out in front of the castle out in the courtyard area  travis yeah its nighttime  matt make a perception check pike  sam make it good  taliesin roll a natural 20  ashley i rolled a natural 20  marisha shut your mouth  travis i rolled a bunch of hit dice from our short rest  matt as youre quietly climbing up the walkway to the base of castle whitestone  ashley hes out in the open  matt yeah you do you look up and see grog /none/ pull a card from the deck  ashley i stand and watch for a moment  sam oh heres the deck  laura oh my god it is really happening i cant fucking believe  marisha travis pull good oh please dont bring pit fiends on our heads  travis i might have  sam negative two to everything  matt hold on deck of many things all right so grog what did you pull  ashley oh shit  matt void  taliesin oh no  marisha that cant be good  matt im sure its fine  laura /none/ thats the worst one you could get  sam the crews laughing somethings bad somethings very bad  travis im pretty sure  laura that is so bad  taliesin oh my god laughs  sam wait pike saw him  matt pike  sam you get a reaction  marisha did our internet go  screaming and groaning  matt of all moments  taliesin cackles this is your doing  matt while were here grog im going to read you the card this black card spells disaster  your soul is drawn from your body and contained in /none/ an object in a place of the dms choice one or  more powerful beings guard the place while your soul is trapped in this way your body is  incapacitated a wish spell cant restore your soul but the spell reveals the location of the  object that holds it you draw no more cards  sam wait read it again  travis ill tell you my soul is drawn from my body my body is incapacitated it is placed  within an object that the dm chooses a wish spell will tell you the location of the object /none/ but will  not reverse the action  sam can anything reverse it  matt finding it and retrieving the object and restoring the soul  marisha you fucking dick youre a fucking dick  laura well the campaign goes on for another i cant believe you just fucking did that  sam wait she rolled  laura ashley  sam she rolled something oh that was her 20 from before  matt looks like we may have her back hopefully because this is going to be oh my god  marisha it is bad  sam oh my god /none/ travis why would you do that  matt give me the card let this be a lesson to everybody out there  laura oh my god  marisha you said you werent going to bring the deck of many things into the game and then you did  matt no regrets  taliesin hashtag no regrets  matt no regerts at all  taliesin oh god i cant even  laura is ashley texting  taliesin shes just yelling obscenities  sam her internet just died  marisha mispronouncing worst fucking timing internet has gone timing worst fucking timing  /dung/ taliesin its just obscenities thats all it is  matt so grog as you draw the card from the deck your vision goes tunneled dark to a pinpoint a  singular pinpoint of deep ruby red and thats all your consciousness falls into a catatonic state  sam does she get a reaction or anything  matt no  marisha she doesnt get shit she just watches  matt she sees it happen  sam with her 20 she saw  matt i know shes aware  sam she cant yell she cant cast something  matt no because he /none/ pulled the card its not a big grunts its a flip  sam all right  matt all righty so  marisha i guess well add that to our to do list  taliesin id like to think that in the next campaign were going to find you in a glass  coffin like sleeping fucking beauty  marisha yeah  travis my bodys still there  sam she rolled a 17  marisha so grogs body is still there  matt hes catatonic until the souls returned  marisha catatonic  matt to be fair youve sealed vecna at /none/ level 19 and 20 this is not going to be an  earthshattering experience  marisha sure its just an annoyance  matt and for the sake of the epilogue evening you guys all planning to return to your various  lives to relax  travis im there catatonic with an open deck of cards in my hand like this  liam you dingus  marisha goddamn it  travis somebodys going to find me  sam to grog he was the dumbest of us all he was the dumb and the dumb  taliesin may he rest in bed /none/ sores for all eternity  matt you spend the next two weeks finding your way through the halls of pandemonium  laura i cant fucking believe that shit  marisha wait we spend two weeks  sam the halls of pandemonium  matt yes where his soul is currently encapsulated  sam god you asshole  marisha in what  travis what are the halls of pandemonium  marisha i should be mourning right now and im hunting your stupid ass down  travis im keeping you occupied i really did this for you  matt pandemonium is a plane /dung/ of madness a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by  howling winds it is cold noisy and dark with no natural light wind quickly extinguishes  nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires it also makes conversation possible  only by yelling and even then only at a maximum distance of ten feet most of the planes  inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape and many of them  have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds  /none/ die down until they sound like distant cries of torment so yeah thats a fun time its a fun  adventure you guys go on to retrieve grogs soul  marisha great therapy lesson  travis well oneshot it later  laughter  marisha a healing trip  sam its a good side quest for the future someday  matt a good moment of oh were not going to get a rest hopefully well get ashley back but  in the meantime for the purposes of this you come back two weeks after extremely angry grog  as suddenly youre /none/ restored and that tiny bead of light fades back and youre not outside anymore  youre actually sitting in a reclined cushioned couch or chair of some kind in castle whitestone  and all of your currently living friends are all around you looking very angry  travis oh it got me a chair  laura you fucking idiot  travis what  laura i cannot believe you did that  travis did what  marisha keyleth backhands him with the hand that has the most rings on it of power  travis do i lose any hit points  /none/ marisha probably not  travis what what happened  taliesin you lost card privileges  sam yep hand them over  taliesin oh we already took the whole deck  travis wait  sam you may lose your belt for this friend  laura yeah youre lucky we didnt shave your beard yeah  travis i fucked up  laura you fucked up a lot  sam percy lost his arm rescuing you  travis im sorry  taliesin are you  travis no  laughter  travis all right i just thought it did fantastic things before i dont /none/ know why it  doesnt like me so much  taliesin i dont think it was personal  travis are you sure  sam youve learned a lesson that we had to pay for  travis all right sorry guys sorry pike  ashley hello  laughter  matt look at that timing i dont even know man  sam pike can you hear us  ashley my internet crashed at the worst fucking time  marisha we cant even see you right now youre a silhouette on the screen but we can hear you  matt pike do you /none/ know what happened  sam yeah i texted her the gist of what happened  ashley okay so you disappeared  matt grogs soul was trapped somewhere on the plane of pandemonium and you guys had to take two  weeks and battle your way through a terrible plane filled with wind and madness and creatures that  were banished there to never escape eventually battling some terrible beast that was guarding the  gem that contained his soul returned and he just now woke up on the couch after restoring his  consciousness to his body and has been /none/ slapped in the face by keyleth and told that he lost card  privileges  travis tearfully and percy lost his arm  ashley oh no wait what  sam well i may have been fibbing about that part  marisha it might be a cheap joke  taliesin i might have lost my arm

gather say your /none/ temporary goodbyes knowing that youre all still very in touch with each other  knowing you care about each other you begin to forge whatever life looks like outside of perpetual  danger and the constant onslaught and struggle of terrors and heroic necessity scanlan  sam oh sorry im having a text romance with ashley johnson right now  matt then ill come back to you  sam no im ready i can pull myself away from pike for a second  matt what does scanlan do in the next year next five years next ten years  sam /none/ clears throat i have one prepared well shes not here so i dont know but i wrote down  ashley can you hear me at all  sam oh god i love this  ashley sorry my internet keeps going out  travis its okay  laura perfect timing ash  matt its all right so assuming that you guys went on a date im discussing with scanlan his  epilogue what does he wish to do in the next year five and ten years  sam my plan what i wrote down was find kaylie make sure shes okay /none/ help pike repair vasselheim  or literally whatever she wants to do give all money to kaylie except for my platinum bracelets  with sapphires worth 2500 gold that i send anonymously to sybil to make sure shes taken care  of long term i would like to use my wishteleport to check on kaylie every now and  then at school or wherever she ends up  matt she ends up at the alabaster lyceum in emon which is one of the highest places of learning  you have connections to the council and with the money that youve /none/ given her she lords over many  of the children of the various nobles  taliesin i would have recommended my tutor but of course vax slit his throat right about the  time you met him he was a good tutor before that  sam i dont know but well wait until we get to ashley to find out how things are going with our  dating otherwise in my free time i would love to use my time to write down the epic stories of  vox machina from our meeting to saving the world and everything in /none/ between it will be difficult as  scanlan is not an author but he will rely on guidance from ioun herself and may even ask sprigg  to be a copyeditor of sorts the working title is in the belly of dragons the legend of scanlan  shorthalt and vox machina working title  travis in the anus of dragons accurately  sam and i hope to finish the book by the time i turn 71  travis how old are you exactly  sam oh id be 70 when we started i was 69  laura you were that /none/ young  sam yeah  laura you motherfucker  taliesin youre full of shit  laura oh my god i cant believe you were that young  travis this whole time  laura i thought you were 300 years old jesus  taliesin just full of shit  sam i mean thats about it i think every once in a while i would maybe try to see if i could see  vax or check in on him somehow but i dont know how other than to scry  matt which does not succeed but you still send your thoughts /none/ and wishes into the ether in hopes  that they find their way there okay  matt so following off that the story of taryon darrington which i have something written for  here based off what he did feel free to embellish or change how you see fit as the months pass the  darrington family has adjusted somewhat to a more humble lifestyle and their work of charity  within the city of deastok and the neighboring lands goes far to clean up the family name from  where it once was while their influence was greatly diminished /none/ and theyre essentially a political  laughingstock the message of their work still strikes a chord in some of the more philanthropic  lords to the north and an alliance is made that protects the darrington name and interests from  the myriads ever wiley grasp for the time being doty 30 now stands a shining golden color gifted  the materials by a thankful ore baron whom taryons brigade of adventurers saved from a  terrifying doppelgängers plot his troupe continues to gain a small bit of notoriety in the  southern lands of the dwendalian empire some good /none/ some humorous his mother mariya ever  cheering them on and making their tabards for years before passing away peacefully proud of her  boy her passing brings the rest of the family closer together than its ever been and the  charitable efforts surprisingly of howaardt now encompass the darrington brigade as a  nonprofit adventuring league during a gambling run in port demali to follow taryon stumbles upon a  now slightly more haggard lawrence now working as a tanner they immediately fell right back where  they left off and lawrence cashed in his life as a /none/ leather worker to join the brigade alongside taryon  laura oh thats so great  sam i love it  matt anything you wish to add to that  sam no i had written a letter but yours is much better yeah thats great  laura you wrote a letter  sam i didnt know how much matt was going to put  matt you could still read the letter  sam i can read the end of the letter  matt okay  marisha oh sam  sam no its fine you did good  matt i didnt mean /none/ to step on anything you did  sam no you did great much better  matt pike wilhand spends his twilight years helping with small tasks around the emerging house  of the everlight as it is built on the northern edge of westruun before age finally takes him in  peace amongst friends and family the redbrick house you grew up in and grog grew along with you  for a while is left in your name and there you know you have ever a homestead in westruun in  memory of wilhand and the friendships you forged what /none/ else would you like to do what else do  you wish to achieve pike as the years go on that could pertain to you and whatever  relationship with scanlan you wish to embellish on  sam should we roll for dating  laughter  matt theres a chart somewhere in second edition  ashley i dont know what grogs plans are but i do know if there were any adventuring to be had  that her and grog got to on some adventures together  travis yeah  ashley and that he always has a place in my /none/ home and i know i would love to im sure at this  point fully rebuild the temple in vasselheim i think things have gone well with scanlan oh man  im getting so emotional  sam like secondbase well or even better than that  ashley well i think if we spend enough time together maybe i dont know can we see what  else life has for us together  sam absolutely  ashley that doesnt have to mean anything more i know your life what you like to do and ill give  you freedom  sam /none/ no i think the most free ive ever been is with you  ashley i think theres no one i would rather spend the rest of my days with besides my pal grog  i think you get a twoforone deal  sam sure the weird family dynamic  travis you guys keep it quiet up there please  sam weird roommates giant lower floor tiny upper floor  liam the ceiling is one inch above your head  ashley i think at some point i ask scanlan for his hand in marriage  sam i mean i would have /none/ to ask wilhand for his permission  matt he passed away  sam well then i would go leave some flowers at the grave  travis you can ask me  sam oh i will ask grog for permission grog as the father figure in our weird household i would  like to ask for your permission to wed your notdaughter pike who is much smarter and older  than you  travis youre a scoundrel do you have any money  sam i have this little black rock that you gave me  travis thats worth literally nothing how /none/ about you give her this and i take out the rare black  sapphire and put it in your hand  sam thats pretty good  travis im fucking watching you you understand  sam i wont hurt her i promise  travis dont you slip up  sam nope i know you could kill me in my sleep  travis i know i usually put dead people in the bag of holding but theres always a first treat  her right  sam would you walk me down the aisle and by walk me down the aisle i mean /none/ carry me down the aisle  laughter  travis highpitched yes  sam all right lets have a group weird hug  matt aw all righty anything else pike are you happy with that  sam do i have to convert pike  ashley whats that  sam do i have to convert im an iounian  ashley no  sam okay im good  laura youre iounish  ashley sarenraes very accepting of other gods  sam multifaith ceremony there you go  marisha 16 rites of passage  matt anything else pike  ashley no  matt okay /none/ all right well leave it at that percival vexahlia since your fates are rather  intertwined i ask you both what are your plans what are your plots  taliesin i dont really think we should settle down that seems like a lot  laura laughs  taliesin i think that i would like to start a very complicated art project thats going to take  many years im not going to work on it all the time day and night but im going to invest some  time in this  laura are you going to be in your /none/ shop a lot  taliesin no im going to build a clocktower like the one in prague im going to take many  years and its going to sit at the front of the castle so it will be outside and there will be  other people working on it it will as a proper clock does it will tell our story once a year  everything will play out  laura holy shit thats good  taliesin and we may start inviting tinkering artisans every year for whitestone to come show  off things that are not necessarily useful /none/ but to show off fanciful inventions and things that are  beautiful  laura i love that idea  taliesin but lets not stay here too often  laughter  laura no although we will have to stay here for nine months every once in a while because i think  we should rebuild the families that weve lost  taliesin theres a lot of names  laura and taliesin so many names  matt how many names  taliesin so many ways to irritate your father  laura five names  taliesin oh at the very least  laura /none/ five  marisha thats a lot of names very long names  liam at least three sets of twins  laughter  taliesin jesus  laura i definitely want to build a statue to trinket the wonder bear  marisha the wonder bear  sam is he dead  laura no trinkets around  sam damn it  laura so centuries of people in whitestone will remember their mascot trinket  marisha he prevents forest fires  laughter  travis rangers hat  laura as the years pass we should start a festival and bears will be everywhere  taliesin /none/ there will be bears will be involved in the festival obviously especially since the  clock tower is part of the festival and bears feature heavily in it  laura perfect  travis only you can prevent forest fires  taliesin only you can prevent the rise of vecna  laughter  laura i was hoping to never stop attempting to contact vax through the temple of the raven queen  matt you do notice that the raven population of whitestone seems to be perpetually seeing blooms  every year far more than it used to  laura i cast /none/ speak with animals on them and i constantly try to communicate with him  matt okay i mean they all seem to be ravens happy to live in this space but it seems to be  more in essence the vicinity more than a specific raven  laura would you be all right if we increased the pelor temple here  taliesin yes i trust your judgment it is not for me but im definitely all right  with anything that makes you happy  laura thank you darling  taliesin to be fair youd do it anyway  laura /dung/ pretty much yeah  taliesin i help cassandra as best i can i think at least once a year we get out and do something  irresponsible  laura definitely  taliesin maybe sometimes drag these kids out for shenanigans  matt cassandra as a note by the way shes had a few pretty difficult brushes with death and the  experiences definitely left a mark on her within the year following the battle with vecna  she begins to remind you of yourself at a very dark time recognizing that you come to her and  help pull her /none/ from a dangerous edge of lashing out at the place shes worked so hard to build you  help her realize that this guilt shes been holding as being a tool of manipulation the times  that she has been is not her fault and used against the ones she loves in that determination  to no longer be a tool for others to use she asks vex to teach her and train her to not just be the  lady beacon of whitestone but also join in as one of its protectors  laura at least she had some /none/ good promise a long time ago  matt that was some time but ive seen what you can do and well i deign to think of how dangerous  the three of us would be if i could reach your level  laura well make you strong darling  taliesin we also insist that she leave whitestone at least once a year for a period of time to do  fuck all  laura yeah theres a beautiful place called dalens closet i think you would love it  taliesin lets not well yes theres well  matt anything else /none/ you guys happy with that  taliesin im content to make a clock tower and make art and never make another weapon im good  matt hmm all right  laura i have make whitestone the tits written in my notes of things that i want to do  taliesin its got a bear im imagining the bear from burning man actually  marisha penny bear  laura yeah penny bear i like it  matt there you go grog  travis im so fascinated by vasselheim i have so many interests that i feel it only proper to go /none/  back and turn myself in to the authorities for punching one of the guards in the face and take  whatever punishment they have for me  matt all right as you head back to the district in which these incursions happened you are  immediately recognized and much to their completely taken aback reaction they bring you in  until somebody of the higher bastions goes you fools this is one of vox machina whats wrong  with you oh i didnt and they all point up at the large titan which is  travis yeah up top /none/ thats where we were  matt which currently has been cleared out of any cursed undead that they know of its a process  that takes a while but it becomes a monument to that battle and it becomes converted into a symbol  of hope for the city for generations to come in vasselheim that titan will stand there lording  over the city as a reminder of what transpired of what could have been lost and what was saved  that day in memory of those that were lost and as you point up to that and they /none/ all realize they  slowly remove your shackles  travis oh im free to go  matt yes sir thank you thank you  travis thats unexpected could you point me in the direction of a library  matt sure come with me as you begin to walk out you watch as a familiar figure steps up to  this portion of the bastions guard post you see a familiar merchant who rushes up and goes i was  being summoned they found the whys he walking free  travis yes you you will come with me  matt gentlemen /town/ this is the man who punched me this is the man who ruined my business i can  travis gentlemen whose word are you going to take the savior of vasselheim or his new tutor  matt what  laughter  matt the guards go cobalt reserve library station is down that way to the left hard to miss  big blue dome you two work this out and they retract back into the guard post leaving the two  of you in the street  travis well unless you have something better to do you could contribute to one /none/ of the greatest  people to ever pass through this city and help me learn to read a little bit more would that be a  problem i only have 8000 gold to give you  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  sam 8000 gold  travis natural 20  cheering  matt laughter didnt even need the advantage all right  sam 8000 gold  matt well that would certainly go far for reparations for the damage youve caused to both  my business my person and my psyche  laughter  matt but im curious to /none/ see what this change of heart is so sure but youre going to pay upfront  travis yes 8000 gold  matt holy shit  travis i could carry it if you want  matt well just make a quick stop over by my shop please  travis fair enough  matt and he drags it and it leaves this big heavy groove in the ground as he pulls it along nope  nope its good i got it struggling noises and leads you to the cobalt reserve and for as long as  youll have him hell begin to /none/ tutor you  travis id like to learn to read a bit more id like to split some time in the temple of kord  matt which takes a while to get rebuilt and you probably help out a bit too earthbreaker groon  who survived though many of his  travis oh he did survive  matt he did survive yeah hes made of hardier stuff  travis id also like to bring pike out every once in a while and we give challengers a shot in the  crucible but mostly im trying to improve my mind and /none/ looking for the next challenge  matt i like it  liam bring him up to eight intelligence  laura yeah  travis sevens a good start  laughter  matt perfect happy with that  travis yeah  matt okay then keyleth  marisha sighs okay naturally help pike rebuild vasselheim in the most immediate of  circumstances eventually retire to zephra go be the actual leader of my people continue to get in  any type of frays that these people invite me on as it reminds me of the good old days and keeps my  promise /none/ to protect this realm any time this realm needs protecting and i find kerrick at some  point seek out kerrick make sure hes okay reconnect with him have coffee you know  matt yeah hes a quick jaunt from zephra thankfully westruuns not that far thats one of  the closer large cities outside of stillben  marisha perfect were weekend buddies  matt laughs  marisha we go to wine country and then i work on the propagated sprig from the sun tree and  continue to build it out hopefully on the ley lines of the planet /none/ and i take the feather that  pike gave me from vax and i embed it into the trunk of the tree as well as any other relics from  the raven queen i can find care for ravens as much as i can  matt there is an uptick of ravens in the space of zephra as well not many but more than there would  be which is usually zero  marisha and from the branch of the sun tree create my own raven tree of the ashari take a  long long long long long time before /none/ i maybe date again maybe but eventually hopefully  after a long long long long long time sunset into the tree and become a part of this realm  matt thats a ways off for you ms archdruid  marisha ways off  matt but you begin those preparations  marisha but thats the plan  matt okay well you keyleth who many only once saw the naive druid girl have a level of respect  now thats carried with that mantle that you hold and the council of taldorei occasionally calls  upon your wisdom and guidance the alliance /none/ between the civilised and the natured world of the  lands irrevocably in taldorei bound to you at this point between you and the earth ashari who  reside up in the cliffkeep between occasional jaunts to emon and whitestone you find renewed  joy in the protection of the people there  one cold cuersaar the 13th the tenth month of the year the cool summer dusk day closes and you  emerge from the quarters to find that the winds come and blow through your hair you step out to  the sound of children laughing as a /none/ dozen ashari kids elf dwarf orc many bloods and creeds rush  past as they play its a familiar sound its a happy sound you glance over at this village  youre protecting and the people that truly look up to you as their leader both not just from a  might source but as a guide and you look to them to teach you things every day as well looking  past as the sun begins to set you see korrin standing by the cherry blossom at the edge of the  cliff near the amphitheatre where you had /none/ your ceremony in pinks and oranges and purples the  sunset takes the sky as you approach he still looks out hes older not too much older but older  as he notices you approach he looks over in all my years not a day passes where awe does not  strike me at the beauty of this world he looks over towards the sunset dont ever lose the  memory of every face whose strength helped you keep this light from fading every single face  marisha i dont think its the faces that keep this light from fading /none/ i think it is what it is  were lucky to experience it a few are lucky to think its beautiful you taught me that i dont  have to appreciate this especially not after what ive seen but i do  matt you need to  marisha only because of what ive seen  matt and you see a bit of heartbreak but he nods his head and reaches out and takes you in holds  you there on the cliff side the winds just being kept at bay im proud of you  marisha thank you its all /none/ i ever wanted its weird once you reach a life goal and then realize  you have the rest of your life i guess i just find new goals sometimes its hard being a  prodigy because then you just grow up to be a regular adult  matt he pulls you in tighter youll always be my girl my little keyleth  marisha thanks dad  matt i love you  marisha i love you  matt sighs anyway i should get to seeing if dinner preparations are being made looks to be a  cold night he tugs /none/ your hand and walks back leaves you there on the cliff side looking out as  the sunlight slowly blinks away over the horizon leaving you with the purples and blues of the  night sky as the stars begin to glitter up you can hear a raven caw catch your ear as you glance  up into the branches of the cherry blossom tree theres just one raven  marisha blow a kiss  matt flies down lands on your shoulder its a bigger raven than any youve seen before youve  not seen this raven around  marisha /none/ little scratch  matt it leans into it  and every day that raven comes to visit  and thats where were going to close the campaign  sam what a nice story  laura wow  travis lets do it again  laughter  taliesin oh my god  matt oh wow when this chapter closes a whole
