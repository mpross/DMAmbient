off our slowly gathering band of adventurers had begun to  have their stories intertwine in the city of trostenwald on the southern reaches of western  wynandir on the continent of wildemount here we had nott and caleb who had been traveling  southward coming and meeting in the center of the tavern the nestled nook inn with jester  beauregard and fjord they were invited to a nearby carnival that had begun preparing for their  performance later /town/ that evening in which they met yasha and molly after swapping some stories  earning and losing some gold they began to gather at the outskirts of the ustaloch the lake right  on the eastern edge of trostenwald for the first opening performance of the fletching and moondrop  carnival of curiosities  taliesin traveling carnival of curiosities  matt upon entering the tent they saw a number of performances however during a musical performance  by this young dwarven girl whose voice was this mysterious magically enchanting experience a  member of the audience rose up and began /none/ to transform into a terrible undead creature that  began to lash out killing another member of the audience who then began to become one of these  same creatures you all grabbing your weapons from yasha who had been keeping them stashed  away leapt into the fray slaughtered both of these terrible beasts just in time for the  crownsguard to rush in and ask you what the hell happened after information had been gathered of  who was immediately available and responsible for this carnival gustav bo the breaker and molly  were marked to be arrested /town/ one of the guards was escorted outside of the tent by yasha who was  going to show him where this young dwarven girl was currently resting and upon being led astray  to the wrong tent she just ran into the distant hills and vanished and that is where we left off  sam so were still at the carnival  matt youre still in the tent  liam with crownsguard  matt with the crownsguard and with watchmaster jossyd the crownsguard that had left naught but a  moment before comes rushing in his breath huffing sweat dripping /none/ from his brow his eyes  wild he goes watchmaster the big woman is gone shes gone the watchmaster turns to him  and says you three go with him search for her they all immediately run out back out the  performers flap and he turns to the rest of you in the group shackle and drag those three down  to the stockade about five guards approach and begin to press gustav bo and molly to the ground  and begin to put chains and shackles on them  taliesin id like to make a counteroffer  matt /none/ hes in midspeech the rest of you keep an eye on the performers here ask around see what  you can find as for the others dont go far  laura the innocent patrons you mean  matt you may be innocent in which case you have nothing to worry about however we have an  investigation to complete so i would ask that you stay in the city and wait until you are called in  you will be questioned and when this investigation is completed regardless of how long  it may take you are not to leave /none/ trostenwald  liam if i could just contribute one word the 40 or so people who are outside and the rest of us  will vouch for this one the colorful one he saved many peoples lives dont take my word for  it theres everyone outside  matt all the rest of the crownsguard glance to each other he goes well unfortunately that is  not for me to decide the lawmaster would have to be appealed to if you wish to come with us we  can bring you along with us to the stockade and you can /none/ speak with her then perhaps she may  grant you leniency but i can give you no guarantee  marisha why dont you just question us right now im confused on why you dont just do that now  matt well we could do that instead well have you arrested put you in the stockade as we  question the rest of you  laura no lets go to the stockade  travis yeah well all be in one place  laura yeah  marisha jails are not my favored terrain just want to point that out not this goaround /town/ no  travis good to know  laura i would have guessed that about you  marisha not really comfortable with that  matt were leaving the rest of you stay in here watch over the performers make sure nobody  leaves come if you wish otherwise well be in touch the watchmaster gathers alongside the  other five crownsguard lifting up the shackles of the three that had been arrested and begin to drag  them outside of the tent and into the night air  liam i send frumpkin to follow  matt okay  marisha can i /town/ double back into the performance area and see if i can find that little girl that  theyre looking for before they do  matt you may if you want to so you send frumpkin just to follow them you guys are staying  behind then  travis are there three regular crownsguard that are going with molly or is the watchmaster going  with them as well  matt the watchmaster is going with them or at least hes exiting the tent with them it looks  like there are five crownsguard attending the three of them that are /town/ shackled  travis ill go out the front exit of the tent just to see if the watchmaster goes with molly  matt okay  laura ill follow fjord  matt okay so the two of you are following anybody with them currently its you two and  frumpkin  sam are we going with them or not should we stay here this is not our affair right  liam i dont know im having second thoughts about being here at all  sam well you sent the kitty didnt you  liam yes and were not going to leave /none/ without him why dont we just  sam follow behind a bit  liam thats right  sam okay sounds good  matt all right so as you guys exit keeping a pace behind watching the  crownsguard guiding the current prisoners towards the actual city frumpkin keeping a zigzagging  distance behind and following  liam dm  matt yes  liam is it possible for me if nott is holding my hand and leading me to go full third eye and walk  blind and deaf here looking through frumpkins senses  matt i would say yes but /none/ you are purely like because all youre doing is walking forward and  you need someone to guide you  liam right  sam and he cant communicate to me either so  liam i can talk but i cant hear you i can talk and hold her hand so she can stop me from  pratfalling all over myself  sam yes but you can talk  matt he can talk but he cant hear you  sam got it okay great  liam but weve done this before so you know to squeeze my hand really hard if /town/ i should pipe down  sam sure  matt all right so first off beauregard  marisha yeah  matt as you back out of the performers exit of the tent into the center of their encampment the  immediate exit there are already four crownsguard currently searching around and setting up a watch  perimeter around the different tents theyre gathering and making sure none of the other  performers have fled and a lot of them are being brought out into an area where theres a number of  tents all facing towards a large campfire in the /none/ center theres a couple of chairs set up there  its kind of the common area for the performers of the carnival and it looks like theyre all being  put out there so they can get a bead on it and make sure they know where everyone else is  marisha im going to try to be aloof stealth a little bit i dont want to make myself completely known  matt are you trying to stealth out of sight or just trying to not draw attention  marisha no just trying not to draw attention  matt okay /town/ all right go and make a stealth check just to see if  sam wait did we just all ditch marisha  laura she just walked out  marisha i ditched you thats cocked thats better 17  matt 17 okay as you kind of dart through the flap of the tent and move behind one of the large  carts that currently is still affixed to a horse that is currently just chewing on an apple and  you hear the crunch in its teeth you glance over past the edge of the immediate near tent and you  /none/ can see this group gathering there and it appears that no ones immediately aware of your presence  marisha do i see the little girl whose name was what was her name  matt toya you do not see her yet the guard just got out there and theyre just beginning to pull  people out you do see the fire dancer brought out there you then see the two yeah ornna the  knot sisters are brought out and pushed out there and theyre all looking very frustrated  marisha are people being amicable  matt yeah theyre not /town/ shoving them around theyre just calling them out to the front so they  know where they are  marisha okay i want to look around do i see any type of movement in the shadows anyone looking  suspicious  matt make a perception check  marisha ooh yeah natural 18 21  matt 21 okay as you glance about you dont see anything lurking in the shadows what you do  notice though is one of them bring toya out of one of the the tent thats on the southern side and  as he brings her out /town/ theres a heavy thud sound and you see coming out from behind the tent the  large form of you heard the name kylre once but the devil toad the obese lizard man whos  stomping up behind  laura is he a dude or is he a creature  matt it looks like a lizard man so scaled humanoid but extremely thick bulbous belly  large almost froglike legs  travis bipedal or on all fours  matt due to the size of his form mostly all fours and lumbering forward on all of them but  sits back /town/ on a bipedal situation  marisha so theyre bringing the both of them out  matt the toad is hiding behind the tent and as soon as toya comes out comes up to the guard and  puffs up its chest the guard spins around and goes for the blade and pulls it out just carefully  marisha am i still next to that horse  matt the horse is currently still up on the cart but is about 30 feet from you  sam beast shape  laughter  marisha im going to take my staff and give a /none/ really nice whack to the horse to get it to run  matt you know what lets go ahead and make an animal handling check on that  sam we never get to make those  liam first of the show  marisha oh my god im so nervous right now  travis youre good youre good youre good  marisha thats not great 11  matt 11 will do it wasnt a hard dc but it was more knowing where to hit it to where it would  cause it to bolt versus just get angry  marisha get /none/ pissed sure kick me  matt so going for not to actually hurt the creature but just enough to spook it you hit it  in the right place towards the back of its hindquarters to cause it to suddenly rear up  neighs cart clattering noise and go into a sprint the cart begins to bounce and smash onto  the ground you can see the wheels clattering into the rocks and the stone between the bits of  marisha im going to bolt in the opposite direction and try and loop around to the south side of the /town/ tent  matt make another stealth check please  marisha big dice big dice okay 19  matt okay you dart around the north side of these tents and youre pretty sure you werent  seen as the cart begins to bolt off behind this horse you see all the crownsguard turn the one  that was currently staring at the devil toad glances off to the side as he glances off the  devil toad takes toya and just pulls her to him protectively and the guard puts his sword away  check points to them and then bolts /none/ off to go after the horse the other three stay watching  over the group  marisha okay can i loop around kind of come up behind them  matt i mean theyre scattered a bit but theres  marisha the devil toad and toya  matt oh yeah make another stealth check youre running through open areas each time youre doing this  marisha yep yells did you see that it leaned to a four ten  travis that is a bastard die right there  marisha that sucked  travis thats a tease  marisha laura put him /none/ in the dice jail  laura i dont have my dice jail out yet its okay hell chill there  matt as you come up around the back of the devil toad the guard that runs past doesnt immediately  notice you because hes focused on where this cart is running off and you can see another guard that  was far away from this encampment thats circling back with him the two of them are now bolting in  the direction as the cart begins to slow its not just going forward forever but it spooked him and  /none/ its starting to slow down theyre just going to inspect it however as you slink up behind the  devil toads head curls back towards you and you hear this deep guttural growls  marisha okay its okay toya and i look at toya hey come on lets get out of here lets go  matt at which point a voice says excuse me  and you can see the three guards are there staring at you  marisha fuck you didnt say there were fucking guards  matt i did say there were three guards the three guards watching /none/ them  marisha i thought you said they left  matt one of them left  marisha one of them left so wait oh shit  matt its a bad stealth check im sorry but theres now three crownsguard right there and  theyre like can i help you  travis time to go to jail  laura oh this is so exciting  sam kill them all  marisha ey i was actually just looking for the loo  matt the guard thats closest to you glances to the other guys and goes she was with the group  /none/ right they recognize you and they look at each other youre going to the stockade my dear  marisha no  matt the three guards slowly approach and they begin to take out chains and manacle you up  sam in an effort not to go to jail you went to the jail  marisha im trying to get the girl i was trying to free the damn girl  matt i know  taliesin youll be fine  matt so youre shackled and begin to be dragged toward the stockade  marisha its just the two guards right  /none/ matt its the two guards now as youre being brought back you can see more guards are coming  from the city to the carnival theyre keeping it under surveillance  marisha so are they taking me away  matt theyre taking you to the city yeah  marisha what are they doing with toya anything are they leaving them behind  matt theyre leaving them behind currently with the guards that are there theyre not arresting  anybody from the carnival but theyre not letting them leave but theyre keeping them there  marisha okay im going to do /none/ a quick  sam kill them all  marisha im in shackles  matt you are  marisha okay im going to do some monk shit here im going to elbow one of the guards right  in the ribs and take the other one and bash the other one in the face and then im going to turn  to toya and im going to say run run go run  matt okay go ahead and  sam make all kinds of rolls  matt first go ahead and make an athletics check  marisha and sam this is /none/ a terrible idea  laura to not drag any attention towards her you are completely shoving her into the limelight  marisha trying to distract these fucking assholes that is a six ten  matt as you go back to elbow you get halfway there before your chains go taut theyre both  holding the chain at each side and you see the tension of it you cant even get him from behind  you imagine in your head you go over it two or three times as you go through the first step  grunt doesnt go anywhere  /none/ travis tried to do the sherlock holmes  marisha do i at least get the run out to toya  matt no im sorry  marisha is she just standing there waiting for a guard  travis she sees you having a seizure in the chains  laughter  marisha what is she doing is she running  matt no honestly the devil toad and her seem pretty close he is grabbing her in a protective manner  marisha no they can both run run for your life fine whatever she wants to get arrested at this point  matt /none/ two bad rolls in a row i know level two  marisha i go join my friends  matt you will shortly ahead of her along the way gustav is just quiet bo the breaker bosun  as you know him by his full name is grumbling under his breath and is trying to outloud piece  together thoughts on what may have what transpired saying things like i dont know you  think its done on the inside or is this somebody trying to sabotage it  taliesin i think maybe it has nothing to do with us i /none/ think maybe we were just caught in the crossfire  matt it is quite possible  taliesin sorry sir trying to keep my mouth shut  matt one of the guards tugs on both of your chains and says quiet now save it for the  lawmaster they bring you in you go in through the lochward into the hillsward which is the  southern portion of trostenwald you are brought to the outside of the stockade which is a large  singlestory tall rectangular building of large stones and masonry its built for function its  not a very /none/ beautiful building but its defensible and it seems fairly wellmade however  there are the banners of the crownsguard marking the doubledoor entrance as youre brought  within you can already see there are two central chairs where two current watch sit just watching  the front door beyond the right you see is an office that you guys are dragged to and the rest  of you eventually catch up to the group you are all brought inside this darkened office inside  relatively simple this isnt a librarytype study office this is very much for function theres a /none/  couple of small crates that contain materials that are too far in shadow to see the details of it  look to be pieces of paper probably gathered evidence or weapons that have been reclaimed  there is a stone desk on the far end and there within this office already accompanied by a  messenger dressed for immediate travel is a toughlooking  dwarven woman in her middle years rapidly  scrawling on parchment her black hair is streaked with silver tumbling past her red and gray  leather armor she finishes writing on this parchment rolls it /none/ up and hands it to the  messenger who immediately darts out of the room without a word past you guys giving you a brief  look as he continues on whatever his business is as soon as your eyes pass off the messenger you  hear a loud slam and you glance back shes put her hands on the table she glances up all  right what riffraff have you brought in to me this day the watchmaster takes the chains of the  three of you and pulls you to the front of the group and says sorry /town/ to be a bother but we have  three individuals arrested in connection with as you have heard so far the deaths at the carnival  performance this evening she rolls her eyes all right bring them forward they go ahead and  pull the chains up the watchmaster bows his head and then leaves the room she steps forward and  goes i am norda it is my job to keep this city safe and keep shite like what happened tonight  from happening i approved your second time on the outskirts of our town and you have killed /none/ two of  my people what have you to say about yourselves  taliesin exactly how did we kill them exactly  matt she glances over at you glances over at gustav i have been told by my guard that you  gave performance and as part of this performance you released two beasts into the midst of the  population  laura well technically he wasnt part of the performance technically he was saving everyone  technically  taliesin thank you yes you see  matt gustav interrupts you and says im so sorry my liege please i take /none/ full  responsibility for what happened this evening on myself these people around me had nothing to do  with this they are not part of the carnival they were just merely helping it is my carnival and  whatever judgement there lies i take upon myself and my head at which point bo the halforc steps  forward against his chains and goes gustav what are you doing hes like shut up please  whatever judgement there is put it upon me and he bows his head low is that the case is he the  only one she /none/ takes a good hard look at you and bo the breaker  taliesin oh are you waiting for me to speak yes hes the only one  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin natural 20 about fucking time you little shit  matt she gives you a look looks over at bo the breaker shakes her head keep these two  downstairs this one let go he seems to be free well be talking to you very soon at which  point the crownsguard drag the chains back and gustav gives you a quick look under his eye and /none/  goes as theyre pulled out of the room out of sight she glances to you well youre out of  chains thats great doesnt mean youre absolved of the investigation so where are you staying  you and your compatriots  laura well technically we just all met technically  matt well technically as far as im concerned youre all together as part of this  investigation  laura were a group you guys  laughter  matt so were going to have our investigators come to wherever youre staying which and she  looks down at some papers /none/ here  looks to be the nestled nook  travis thats correct  matt all right dont leave the city well be in touch  laura great i really like it here so thats good that we get to stay so long  matt do you have something to say  taliesin no just shocked to see someone die in front of me not more than  travis i can assure you were here to cause no trouble we will be as compliant as we possibly  can be  matt good dismissed she claps the edge of the table /town/ the remaining crownsguard whos left there  to keep watch escorts you out off the stockade escorts you onto the street  laura her accent is really strong its hard to not match her accent  laughter  taliesin its the one accent that i really have trouble with  travis would you call it infectious  taliesin bastard  matt sorry  taliesin the one that we know is a problem  liam im going to call my cat back to me and i drop the telepathy and i just start tugging you  back to the nestled nook /none/ come on we have to talk about this we have to decide what were going to do  sam right away  travis excuse me  laura theyre not with us  travis oh i thought you were right behind us  liam my cat was in there but not i  matt yeah but youd have to stay within 100 feet to maintain that  liam well we wouldve walked up to the building the cat wouldve scurried around if possible so  id like to think that i heard all that which is why just i said all /town/ the things i did  matt you did hear all that okay and id say as theyre making their way out you can probably  duck around without them seeing you as they left yeah you can do that so you guys are jettisoned  into the street its now probably just past midnight  travis mollymauk i dont mean to pry into your business but has this ever happened to you  before  taliesin this has never anything like this has ever happened before and thank you for the  record i dont owe any of you anything /none/  travis oh i dont know about that  taliesin i swear but thank you and im ready to help with this  laura do you think it was the little girl  taliesin no thats an act thats not anything its just a show  travis right the large toad that was with the girl whats the story there  taliesin its nothing special its just a guy making a buck all right hes fine  matt you hear the footfalls of guards approach and the rattle of chains as you see beauregard  taliesin by the way wheres /none/ the obnoxious one the really loud  matt as opposed the rest of you who are gingerly brought up you see beauregard being pulled  forward but now the chains around her are being pulled taught on two sides shes being brought  forward like a wild animal almost  matt and shes just being led towards the stockade  marisha help  laura what happened  marisha help help help help help help help help help  laughter  marisha help im with you im with you help help  laura oh i thought you didnt like jails  /none/ marisha clears throat help  taliesin is this part of the show by the way i was just curious  travis unfortunately no  matt which is the last thing you see as she is yanked into the stockade and out of sight  taliesin im going to be very helpful and not go in there with the two of you while you try and get  her out  laura so should we go in and try to get her out  travis well yeah  laura okay  taliesin ill stand guard  laura well follow her in /none/  travis dont leave  taliesin i have nowhere to go  matt you walk in behind her you watch her being pulled to the stairs shes bypassing the office  of the lawmaster right now and is being brought to incarceration before being questioned they bring  her to the stairs and a torchlit subterranean basement area as you begin to approach and follow  behind you can see one of the guards who is currently on watch he sees you guys just exit and  then walk back in following another prisoner and stands up and goes im /none/ sorry where are you  going  travis it was a busy day for us unfortunately were partially responsible for this one as well  bad luck  laura she was also helping to save a lot of people big misunderstanding  matt well see her into her cell and please exit the vicinity  travis fair enough  matt appreciate that he follows behind you guys theyre on high alert and theyre a bit  scattered you get the sense right now that they have a lot of their initial stock of guards  offsite right now so theyre /none/ doing the best they can to hold on to what they currently have in the  stockade  travis to the side i say to jester i say this does not really fall in with keeping a low  profile we talked about this  laura i know isnt it so weird  travis yeah it is  matt you guys follow down to the basement portion of this which theres a heavy locked door  immediately that is opened from the opposite side you hear a couple of keys turn and the shifting of  wood against metal before /none/ the door opens and reveals the rest of a long hallway that is flanked  by two rows of cells iron bars about maybe two inches apart going across the entirety of this  long hallway you cant quite see the end of it until you step down to where the door frame is  and there is probably a total of ten cells to each side as you walk through you can see in the off  shadows in the corners a few huddled bodies hunched or asleep keeping to the shadows and out  of the light the /none/ smell of mildewed wet compost and piss hits your nose like a wall  laura it smells like caleb down here  laughter  matt you get about five cells in where you can see the guard that was previously in there just  finish off closing the cell that contains both gustav and bo the breaker they move to the cell  just beyond that open that cell and then go ahead and put beauregard into that one  travis are they not going to take her to see the lawmaker  laura i know why doesnt she get /none/ to talk to the lawmaster  matt as he closes and locks it because she decided not to come helpfully  laura what do you mean  marisha ah oh no you misunderstood see that was just i have this spasm that has this twitch  it was an injury from like a childhood thing  laura oh no are you guys making fun of her because of her spasm  marisha yeah thats actually fake crying it was very sensitive for me i had a really tough  childhood i was just trying to find a bathroom  matt /dung/ the three guards walk away not caring who were there previously and  sam spasm shaming  matt at this point a man who is on the far end of the hall walks up and you can see him hes a  man with a heavy bushy beard that obscures a lot of a dark leather mantle over a general cloth  tunic he has burly arms heavy torso super scrawny legs a widows peak and he looks to be  the jailer he walks up and puts his hand on the bars and goes oh well if you want /none/ to be  patient im sure the lawmaster will be here sometime in the morning and you can discuss  whatever this business is but if you want to say goodbye nows the time  travis actually we were just upstairs and it would really help us if we could perhaps  expedite the process perhaps theres an arrangement we could come to if she could see the  lawmaster now  marisha yeah im looking injured man i show him my eight hit points of damage  taliesin how many kittens is that again  matt thats sixteen kittens /none/ kittens have half of a hit point i dont think kittens have more than  that  liam thats eight frumpkins  travis an audience is all were asking for no favors  marisha yeah this is just a wrong time wrong place thing  matt make a persuasion check  sam use it  travis god bless 16  matt he gives you a look and says all right but if she gets angry its not on me  travis i understand thank you for your understanding  laura shes a very calm person ive never seen her angry /none/ ever  matt he gives a whistle another crownsguard comes up and approaches him and he goes im  sorry could you go and fetch the lawmaster they are requesting an audience if she gets angry  just add it to this ones sentence the guard exits and a brief time by you can hear the slight  muddled cursing of a dwarven female descending the stairs you can see she has an overcoat on was  halfway out of the stockades finishing up her evening in her office  travis beau remember your little sister  sam oh what /none/ little sister what  liam were not there  matt so as the lawmaster approaches now pulling the coat over herself she goes okay so youve  returned apparently needing to poke into what business now before i go off and get some food  travis i do hate to trouble you again twice in the same evening its incredibly inconvenient  matt i hate being troubled twice in the same evening  travis if we may this sweet girl here was also part of our party and she is quite the protective  one im afraid that she was /town/ also providing aid to our fellows in that tent im afraid her younger  sister was attacked in a similar way i feel its only prudent to acknowledge that she was trying to  protect this young dwarven girl that performed in the circus she means no harm  laura it was an adopted sister  marisha i practically raised her its a sensitive subject  matt okay i would like a deception check  travis oh yeah baby 24 natural 18  matt modified by their answers  laura i was helping  travis im new at this stat /none/ dont fuck it up  matt she gives a narrow look through her eyes looks to one of the other guards that you can see  standing in the back a familiar one to you beau and goes is this true he goes it appeared to  us that she was attempting to escape upon us trying to bring calm to a very tense situation  but ill leave it in your realm lawmaster she looks back so your sister apparently is part  of this scenario as well  marisha adopted sister  matt okay well your sisters under /tavern/ investigation  marisha sure  laura shes staying at the same place that we are  travis indeed and we can be found at any hour the nestled nook inn is where we are  marisha and im more than willing to be compliant with the investigation in fact you can see the  injury the beast left on my ribs so if you want to test it for any type of specimen samples feel  free its very painful but im willing to do it for the cause  laura do you need me to heal that  marisha /none/ through gritted teeth no for the cause do it for the cause  matt at which she looks to you now and goes are you saying you might have been infected by this  beast  marisha no its a separate issue there was two things going on there was like the big angry  toad beast and he got a swipe at me and then there were people who were getting attacked  matt theeds and she looks over to the jailer who goes aye and she goes could you have a  look at this wound for me /none/ real fast i want to make sure this isnt something thats going to  spread  marisha yeah yeah uhhuh  travis a great idea indeed and thankfully there was no fleshtoflesh contact  marisha nope  laura yeah the big zombie beast especially was using a lot of like sticks and stuff to attack  people more than any kind of mouth  laughter  matt the jailer theeds takes a quick look at the wound and he goes no it appears to mainly  be just bludgeoning i mean well keep a close eye on her you can /tavern/ see now the lawmaster is  rubbing her eyes in frustration and goes i just want to sleep  travis indeed it would give us no greater pleasure than to get out of your hair  matt fine well have guards posted at the outside of the inn youre not to leave until this  investigation is complete it may take days until we find out whos responsible for these deaths and  bring them to justice you are not to leave the tavern  travis understood  laura like at all during the day even just a question if /tavern/ we wanted to shop or something not  okay  matt not until this is done  laura cool  matt because otherwise youre welcome to stay here instead  laura it is really beautiful here but i think id rather stay at the inn  travis indeed we would this is most gracious of you lawmaster norda  matt get them the fuck out she turns around and sighs heavily as she stomps out of the  chamber the jailer opens the cell door and allows beauregard back out and he looks a bit confused  but amused at /tavern/ the same time the guards that had originally arrested you escort you out not  leaving any element of their sight off of you they escort you guys to the actual inn itself to  the bottom floor of the nestled nook inn watch you enter and then post up right outside the main  entrance to the tavern  laura you should have spasmed a couple times on the way here  marisha aw shit  laura yeah opportunity missed  marisha my little sister what the what  laura shes a dwarf shes human  travis what no /tavern/ i was trying to say she had a little sister that had a similar incident and that  made you try to protect toya i was trying to throw you a bone  laura oh you didnt make that clear at all  matt are you guys up in your room or are you in the tavern  liam yeah were having a talk  travis were under watch  marisha i was just trying to go with what you said  travis yeah you did all right  marisha all right i mean it kind of worked but youre /none/ not

you save her she turned those people into zombies  marisha stammers  travis we dont know that  laura i mean she could have  taliesin she didnt  laura oh hi youre here  marisha yeah if anything we should be looking at this guy why are we putting our neck out for /town/  you  taliesin youre putting your neck out for toya for some strange reason and i dont know why  shes perfectly capable of handling herself  travis have you been to this town before  taliesin not that i can remember they all look the same after a while  matt youve come through once but that was a while back and you werent really paying  attention  taliesin busy yeah  travis and youve never seen conditions like this affect any other carnival goer before  taliesin nothing like this hundreds possibly thousands of shows yeah /tavern/ thousands of shows  nothing never its not us  laura so great were stuck in a city that has zombie issues thats all  travis where are the other two  taliesin which other two  travis the stinky one and the little one  taliesin oh your friends  travis yeah can we look around and see if we spot caleb and  taliesin you call them stinky and the little one all right  matt you spot around the interior of the tavern they dont appear to be nearby  travis i wonder if they came back /tavern/  laura ill go up and ask the tavern keeper  matt okay yorda  laura yeah yorda  matt oh hi everything all right you had a few bruiser types leading you in here some of the  crownsguard huh  laura oh my gosh there was this big trouble at the carnival did you go  matt i heard about that i didnt go in there but people are coming in here saying  laura somebody turned into a zombie and then  matt i heard that thats incredible  laura yeah and then were all under investigation /none/ because we saved them these guards  are weird hey did you see the wizard guy the stinky guy and the little halfling  matt yeah they came in not but a few minutes before you did they went upstairs  laura oh great theyre here  travis they are  laura yeah  travis good  matt meanwhile the two of you are upstairs in your own chambers  liam during all of that i would have dragged you back here brought you upstairs and i whip off my  ratty coat throw it on the bed and sit /none/ down on the ground so that im eye level with you nott  sam hi  liam nott you and i have to make some decisions right now okay  sam now  liam yes  sam why  liam well i know why we said we were coming here  sam get some booze got some books find a little taste of civilization maybe some better food  liam yeah i didnt say i also had the idea you know you and i meeting and teaming up has  been a good thing  sam oh yes very good /none/ i know everyone else makes fun of your smell but i dont smell  nothing  liam thats what i like about you i have been thinking and yesterday just furthers that  thinking that i dont think you and i are enough i had the idea that we would come here maybe and  find others that we could tag along with or meet up the way you and i did but now i think that is  a terrible idea the people we spent the day with are lunatics i dont think that we can do this  /none/ ive changed my mind entirely and i think we should go but we cant now because we are stuck  here for the moment  sam under sort of holding arrest or something we cant leave the city  liam no  sam but i was thinking about this the people we met down there and spent the day with they are  lunatics but they draw a lot of attention to themselves leaving us free to sort of slink back  into the shadows a little bit it might be sort of the perfect camouflage no ones going to /none/ be  looking for a little goblin girl anymore because theyll be looking at the crazy people the  tieflings running around smashing shit  liam you know i had not thought of it quite in that way and that is a good point but i am not  convinced im not convinced and perhaps were better off maybe i was too ambitious  sam well lets give it a day and if things seem a little bit you know skinkydoodie tomorrow we  can fritter away in the middle of the day or something  liam all right well /none/ well wait and see while were here one thing okay no money pot no rat  food none of those plays i have silver we dont need it right now  sam but we need to replenish the healing potion you used if we dont have that then what happens  the next you get in trouble  liam were sealed here and they are watching were with a couple of tieflings a little person  in a doll mask and a dirty ginger weve got people staring at us every second of the day we  need to dial /none/ it back a little bit  sam all right but how on earth are we all right we can cool it with the cons for a couple  of days but i cant promise that i wont get the itch again  liam you just talk to me you hold frumpkin just keep your hands full with frumpkin okay hold my  cat okay  sam all right  liam and then this is going to blow over because we didnt do anything we did something good  sam no i didnt do nothing we just went to a show /none/  liam thats right  sam it was a pretty good show up until you know the dead people part  liam but it was a good show wasnt it  sam yeah well well lay low should we pretend that were still friends with these people  liam i was going to suggest the same thing in fact i think we should go downstairs theyre  going to be coming back we dont want to cause a stir with them either we just want to leave if  thats what were going to do  sam dont worry ill /tavern/ turn on the charm  taliesin thank god  liam okay lets get a drink  sam thank gods  liam we head downstairs  matt you guys head down you get to the bottom of the stairs just in time to see jester beauregard  molly and fjord looking across the tavern making their way in your direction and you guys notice  them meeting you in the tavern room as well  sam oh thank god youre here and safe we missed you somehow we got separated friends  laura that happens yes  marisha

mother always said nothing in life is free  taliesin i can tell  marisha none of this absolves the dodgy goblin who slinked past that first question where are  you from what are you traveling from why the mask  travis only because we seem to find /none/ ourselves in quite the predicament  sam were just a couple of friends strolling around the countryside looking for adventure  marisha sure you are  liam do you see many goblins walking around cities here  marisha it has nothing to do with that people who move from place to place frequently tend to  have other stories as to why theyre doing it  liam well let me make it clear goblins are not typically welcome in any cities that is why the  mask  marisha well youre going back to the goblin thing im more curious /none/ about the travel thing  sam we have a string of bad luck we tend to get in trouble in places for various reasons some of  which is my fault most of which is my fault i have sticky fingers i cant help myself  sometimes im fascinated by little bobbles and fancy pieces of jewelries and i love trinkets so  much i just have to take them and have them with me and put them in my pockets its gotten  us in a few scrapes a couple times caleb he is fantastic very patient with me /none/ understands but  really its my fault its not him hes a smart man a brilliant magician have you seen some of  his tricks are phenomenal really  travis no id love to  sam i feel bad to because we never stay in one place long enough for him to have a decent shower  laughter  travis its a moving story  marisha i immediately check my pockets after that to see is nott has lifted anything is everything  still there all my coin  matt make an investigation check  taliesin im going to join /none/ you on this one  marisha not great not great at all six  taliesin 16  matt 16 everything seems to be in order for you  marisha wait that was a 15 right that was the dice i rolled 16  matt everything seems to be in order  marisha okay  sam anyway thats the long and short of it  laura what do you do with the things once you steal them  sam well the nice ones i keep i have a little  laura do you have a collection  sam i collect a /none/ lot of things but in the last place we hunkered down it was all taken from me  we were in one of those prisons before am i sharing too much im sharing too much arent i  we were in a prison they took all of our belongings i lost all of my collections i had a  lovely rock collection i had a rare coin collection i had a stick collection yeah its  all gone now  laura what about shiny things though  sam i love them i just dont have any right now  laura /none/ because i think if you have sticky fingers for sticks and rocks i dont think that will get  you in trouble  sam true but they were like peoples canes and things  laughter  sam i mean i call them sticks because i dont need them but i suppose they really needed them  laura yeah that makes sense  taliesin theres only one way to find out  marisha wait im sorry i think i need clarification if sticks mean things like valuable  canes what do rocks mean to you  sam you know those rocks /none/ that humans wear on their fingers and around their necks and stuff  theyre really nice rocks  liam we dont have many of those at the moment  travis would it be fair to say that the more someone desires something the more youre  interest increases  sam oh i dont care about the people who have them i just like pretty things toys anything  really  laura ill keep an eye out for things that you would like  sam okay can you help with that  laura i can if you want me to or /none/ i can point it out  marisha is it the joy of taking the things or do you just like gifts  sam no its the collecting  liam its like a nervous tick a little bit  travis are you good at it do you get caught very often  sam well would you like a demonstration  laura yes  travis now jester if i may we are already in a little bit of a pickle  laura steal something from me do you want me to close my eyes  sam sure thatll make it really easy /none/ are they closed  laura yeah  sam all right out of practice here im going to do a shot crack my knuckles  laura just dont take the thing on my waist because hell be pissed  sam hell be pissed what  laura yeah  sam he  laura yeah  sam whats on your waist  taliesin im looking at her waist whats on her waist  matt

three  laughter  matt you close your eyes and feel a tug and a shake  sam plus eight  matt whats your passive perception  taliesin im going to guess ten  laura no its 13  /none/ matt so yeah you totally feel  laura youre doing great  sam this is not how it usually works the person is not really expecting it this is embarrassing  really i have the one skill and i failed at it  laura its okay you can keep practicing  liam there is that one magic trick that youre able to do would you like to show them the magic  trick that you can do i pull out a small red clay ceramic bowl then i pull out a copper piece  here you know the trick right /none/  sam yes i know the trick takes a little bit of time doesnt it  liam youre good  sam okay clears throat i do know one piece of magic feast your eyes  travis i take one step back  on the sacred money pot of school  if you place a copper piece into this pot  and say the magic words  whats the magic word again  liam fibulous  sam fibulous it will turn into a silver piece  laura should i say it  taliesin i want to hear you say it anyway /none/  sam only i can say it  laughter  sam for everyone has their own magic word and it wont work with you  vocalizing trills  by the ancient order of the school fibulous  liam that is a silver coin right there  laura oh my gosh wait a minute does this mean the silver i won from you was actually copper  sam no it only works up  laura great thanks for the silver  sam well no we werent giving you the silver piece just showing you a bit of magic this pot is /none/  actually quite powerful it can do that once a day so if youd like to purchase it  laura can you turn this into a gold piece  sam well it only works once a day  laura well tomorrow can you make it gold  sam i think it only does the copper to silver  liam the magic is not that strong  sam yes its a mild magic pot but if youd like to purchase it from us we can sell it to you for  five gold  laura five gold for one silver a /none/ day that doesnt add up  travis by the end of the week you made your money back  laura no  sam at discount for friends three gold  laura three gold  sam and for that well teach you your own magic word  laura thats pretty good  taliesin thats 40 days  laura 40 days  sam you can do it once a day forever you have it for the rest of your life  laura yeah but i have lots of money i dont need it  sam but

silver magically  laura how about skinky doodie  liam skinky doodie that is unique im sure no one else has possession of that arcane power word  i could consider it yours if /none/ you focused on it

to open all the windows  matt being about one oclock in the morning at this time and the energy in the tavern has come  to a quiet crawl those who are keeping their cups are either snoring or in the process of preparing /none/  to go to sleep you watch as adelaine the barmaid is walking around cleaning up tables and  suddenly all the windows in the room slam open with a heavy impact and theres a burst of wind  that comes through the two crownsguard that were outside flanking the opening doorway suddenly rush  and look in and look about at the lot of you  taliesin sorry drinking i did order two extra two extra  matt they both just slowly curl back to their perimeter  taliesin youre no fun  marisha yeah circus woo circus coming /town/ to town  travis jester i meant a trick from caleb

hands and feet out in an akimbo pose  liam a second little globule of light comes out  sam i feel it coming hit me  liam then two more at the same time come out of my hand then they amass upon my little companion  and form a similar sized little humanoid of light that then coincides with my little friend she is  glowing golden on a table in the middle of the nestled nook  sam sings  liam the goblight ladies and gentlemen the goblight  sam thank you  matt theres some /none/ claps in the back rooms you see one of the drunken gentlemen has come to  semiconsciousness and goes thats impressive

relatively new for me though so im just trying to learn  liam are you reading a lot  travis no i wonder if maybe i should be  liam well it could be helpful although im a bit of an amateur teacher i

poke it does  it seem infected  marisha does it hurt  laura im not going to poke it with my finger though im going to poke at it with a fork  marisha dont poke at me with a fork  matt right now shes inspecting it you take a fork off the table and poke /none/  marisha no you dont  laura ill use the blunt end dont be such a baby  matt she pushes it in and the bruise hurts a bit you watch as this sickly pus liquid begins to pour  out with a thick viscosity and a lot of it you all of the sudden feel like youve punctured a  balloon thats beginning to erupt and you feel awful then you blink a few times and its just a  bruise you hear this distant cackling  laura oh motherfucker hes such a dick  sam what who what /none/ whats going on  marisha my bruise is in the shape of a dick  laura that would be really cool  marisha that would be fun  laura im just going make sure im going to push on it a bit more i think its okay youre fine  marisha all right ill sleep it off  laura i think i need

to draw mollys horns all full of jewels and stuff im going to draw the  stack of books  sam the monster attack  laura and im going to draw like a zombie but like as an old man but as hes biting his dentures  fall out and hes not no teeth  matt /none/ all righty fairly decent sketches actually you eventually find yourself to sleep  the rest of you go to your respective rooms and find yourselves falling into a nights rest as  evening comes to a close and the morning brings you to consciousness you are rested you are  healed up your spells are restored  sam i can use the long rest feature of dd beyond  marisha you hit a button  laura and all my spells back  taliesin there is a button for it  sam whoa nothing changed no spells i lost ten hit /none/ points what the fuck ive done something

curled bit of frost on the outskirts of the glass  its probably /none/ 800 or 900 in the morning at this point in time and the day is yours what do you  wish to do  marisha as i wake up i sit up and i go jester  laura hmm  marisha were you laughing to yourself last night i just kept hearing giggling it was obnoxious  laura im sorry  marisha uhhuh i just get ready  matt as a note too for all the

little prayer and put everything back on  travis are you praying over your swords  taliesin i am of course  travis is that part of your thing  taliesin you seem honest  travis i try to be  /none/ taliesin well the swords are magic according to my mum they go back in our family generations to  a very unusual rare line of tiefling that came from a demon of ice that lived inside a volcano  our family and i take this with a grain of salt were royal guards were entrusted with these magic  swords and these swords can only be activated by the blood of the royal family so in honor of any  fighting i ever do with them i make sure my blood is at least drawn once  travis thats quite /none/ the story can i insight check him  matt yes you may  travis 15  taliesin what am i fighting against  matt this would be deception  taliesin that would be deception all right im lying like a motherfucker  travis well thank you for sharing that honest story with me it means a lot  taliesin i walk

detailed plan  laura yes  travis i like it are we taking anybody with us  laura well if they can make themselves not look like themselves then sure  travis fair enough do you want to ask any of them  laura hey beau  marisha yeah /none/  laura do you have anything you can do to make yourself not look like you  marisha i take my robes and i flip them inside out and i take some dirt and dirty it up a little  bit and take my hair down and i steal a scarf off of jesters stuff and i do a  bandana around my head  laura no you look like you with a bandana around your head  travis yeah thats not going

breakfast i guess  liam yeah were already down there  matt youve already gone down there  taliesin ive already gone im having breakfast im leaving a note with the barkeep for yasha if  she comes back  matt okay  marisha i guess i go down and have breakfast as well  matt as you guys wander down you find caleb and nott already at a table and mollymauk returning  from the bar after delivering that note  travis yall are downstairs  sam messy eating noises  /tavern/ laura can i try to pick a piece of bacon off your plate  sam growls sure for you  laura thanks  travis its like a little dog the little back foot creeps up growls if we could were did  you just fucking shit we were thinking of maybe finding our way outside of the inn for a bit i  dont want to presume anything but do you have the ability to change the way you look  liam to change the way i look  travis yeah you know  liam to leave the inn  /tavern/ travis yeah assume a different form  liam why would i do that to leave the inn  laura so we can find out why there are zombies  liam why wouldnt i just walk out of the inn  laura well because we were told we cant leave the inn  sam we werent told that  travis right  laura huh well thats convenient  sam but i can change my appearance  laura wow i would never know it was you  sam yeah  travis molly what about you  taliesin well i mean look at /none/ me i go into my bag i do have a disguise kit dont i i think i  do its so weird to just have things now yeah i have a disguise kit  travis fair enough  sam what does that mean  matt it means he can use to try and disguise himself hide features  taliesin itd be a little tricky for me i  look like what im going to look like  but the rest of you could do a little work  travis beau i dont want to leave you behind but i  /town/ laura its true i have a disguise kit too i could help you out  marisha would you do my makeup for me  laura im really good at makeup  marisha are you  laura yeah  marisha lets do that  laura im really shit at makeup  laughter  taliesin we could just shower this one that would be enough  laura he can leave apparently  liam yeah we could but not town we were told to stay in town  laura no no were going to stay in town  sam what are we doing /none/ again  laura we have to find out why there are zombies so we that dont get arrested for being zombies  sam so we solve the case to clear our own name  liam why shouldnt we just wait for it all to blow over we didnt do anything  taliesin i tend to find these things dont blow over necessarily as more they just eventually decide  someones guilty and take their revenge on them  liam do you find yourself in situations like this often  taliesin not this particular one but yes  marisha i mean /none/ look at him no offense or anything  taliesin none taken really a little taken but thats fine  travis he makes a point i think that the sooner we find the cause of this the sooner we can get  out of here  taliesin shes right immediately the two of us are going to get hit with this  sam if we solve the case we would be absolved its not a terrible plan  marisha and youre so concerned with your goblin friend i mean hes in the same boat as the  tieflings  liam thats /none/ a girl  laura i know its hard to tell  marisha i said your goblin friend  laura and laura you said he  marisha whatever  sam listen weve all had a rough night i know that my features arent necessarily the most  feminine among goblin kind i understand its hard to tell  laura i can tell  liam everybody can tell  laura yeah  marisha im working on it  travis lets get out of here can i walk back into a privy washroom area  matt yeah upstairs at the very end of /none/ the hall is the communal washroom  travis can i use my mask of many faces to cast disguise self on myself  matt sure what form so you want to take  travis older whitehaired with a beard just very simple peasants clothes maybe a bit of a  farmer or a land worker  matt okay easily enough basic browns and tans and general farm workers tunic and supplies  travis smudges dirt on the fingernails  matt yeah easy enough  laura im going to help beau you know what im going to do for you im /none/ going to use my disguise  kit im going to give you a beard  marisha oh yeah  laura yeah and im going to turn you into a dude thats a good disguise right  marisha yeah  laura yeah and a mustache and a hat  marisha love it  sam you really have to sell it though and act like a dude  marisha low gravelly voice i think i can do that  sam oh yes  marisha im going to go a step further and tape down my boobs bandage them down all the way /none/ you  know wrap them stuff my crotch a little bit  matt all right go ahead and make a dexterity check  taliesin do you want assistance with this  laura was he helping me  matt if you want to  laura sure  matt so take it with advantage  taliesin oh with advantage  laura good okay with the advantage dexterity 15  matt 15 okay you actually manage to sell a decent disguise  marisha do i have some five oclock shadow  matt at a distance at like three or four feet would be /none/ passable and walking quickly by upon  close inspection you could see through it  liam is it like one of those old kids toys where you use the magnet to pull the little filings up  matt more or less  marisha mr woolly  matt a medieval version of that  liam herr woolly  matt but impressive using the kit and using whatever scraps of clothing you can find and amass  you manage to get a relatively topknot silverlake hobo version of beau functionally ready to go  laura its good its good  marisha wait /none/ fjord how do you sound say words youre manly  travis and marisha manly words mirror image i got nuts  laughter  laura and ill cast disguise self on myself as well and turn myself into a human with blonde  hair and shes going to be very cleanlooking  sam angelina  laura yes with big lips and a couple jewels on her fingers  matt okay just doublechecking here disguise self lasts for is it an hour yeah i thought it  was an hour so while theyre doing that are you using your disguise kit on /none/ yourself  taliesin i assume ive just got some very basic black robe that just  matt yeah with a cloak and hood and makeup you can probably pass for human as long as you keep  the hood up and keep most of your more ostentatious garb hidden  taliesin im sure ive got a set  matt go ahead and make a dexterity check for your disguise kit  laura do you want help  taliesin yes please this is a lot of work its a natural 20 thatll do it  matt all right between making your /none/ skin tone more of a natural tan peach humanoid color bring  the hood up you actually pull some of your hair forward and adhere it a bit around the horns so  that it looks almost like a cluster of hair in the front you manage to tuck in and tie your robe  behind you your usual clothing and then using an overrobe to hide most of the material and you  look like a dude passing through so with that your disguises are complete your spells are cast  marisha is that your human face  liam /town/ while theyre doing all that i want to stroll outside and see if theres crownsguard  outside or what im just going to get a breath of fresh air and see whats on the street outside  of this place  matt okay as you exit there are two gentlemen in full crownsguard gear one is standing outside  the other is currently sitting in a chair and as soon as you walk past they both scan you up and  down continue to watch you pass by  liam good theres only just the two at the door  /tavern/ matt just the two that you can see at the front yes  liam okay all right so i just take a minute or two i go back inside and on notts shoulder  and say were good yeah i think were good  sam excellent  laura should we try to do this then  travis in twos or singles  laura yeah of course not all at the same time thats obvious  travis level two trying to get out of a fucking inn  marisha its so hard  taliesin now im kicking myself  marisha so /none/ anxietyinducing  taliesin no never mind i didnt do it at the time i cant do it now no retconning never  mind  liam im going to squat down over with you privately i still think that this is a bad idea  but i can tell that you want to  sam well its just that listen theres no offense i enjoy our talks and your schooling and  everything but i havent talked this openly and freely with other people in months its amazing  liam it really is pretty nice isnt it  sam yes  /none/ liam still if this goes south we leave  sam were the first ones out the door  liam easily  sam yeah theyll never know who we were  liam caleb and nott  sam well dont say that too much i mean yes they do know that were caleb and nott yes  liam all right  sam okay  liam so were doing this  sam yeah lets just go with and see where it leads  laura can i walk up to nott  sam hi yes we werent talking  laura highpitched do you like /town/ my outfit  sam oh what are you im sorry im just a young girl from the village  laura and im just a young girl from town  sam i dont know anything i should go get my father  travis highpitched new york is where id rather stay  laughter  laura nott its me its jester  sam but you look like  laura i know this is how good i am at magic check me out are we leaving here or not  sam are you afraid youll be propositioned on the street  laura i /none/ am really attractive right now  sam those lips are very big  laura i came over here to give you the blessing  sam what is that what does that do  laura it helps you with your stealthing  sam oh the stealthy thing yes thank you so much ill accept it  laura youre welcome okay thats it but ill see you outside at some point okay dont be  scared come up to me  sam and laura okay  matt okay in what order are you leaving  travis should i go first  laura /tavern/ sure  marisha are we going out in pairs like you said deeper are we going out in pairs  taliesin has adelaine noticed any of this  matt i imagine you guys have been using your disguise kits in your own rooms and chambers  other than that no one immediately seems to be noticing make a perception check  travis not command ops in the tavern hall  taliesin lets call that a  laura 14  taliesin 14 thank you  matt you do see yorda the barkeep in the process of wiping out some glasses at /none/ the end  shes occasionally giving a glance over to you guys as youre walking around  laura whispering you go first  travis you want to come with  marisha yeah  travis dont do anything stupid mouth shut eyes forward show me how you walk maybe a little  less thats nice i also assume a little limp slight  matt ill say for the purpose of this each of you make a performance check  laura oh god  travis 20  marisha 16  matt okay the both of you exit out holding your breath out /tavern/ of your peripheral you can see the  deep reds and golds of the crownsguard armor flanking you as you breach the outer porch of the  tavern stepping down into the dust to the main street you curve to the left and see nor hear any  reaction from either of them  travis just keep moving to the other side of the street  taliesin i go single just a little bit after and i rolled a natural 20  sam is that three for the night  taliesin yep  sam oh my god  travis what /none/ color is that die  taliesin it seems to be iron like my will  matt it may not have been the snitch after all you asshole  taliesin me and my magic swords  matt apparently all right you saunter by without an issue by saunter i mean you stumble  through you hear a cough at one point and it causes you a moment but you just continue on  without notice  laura oh everybodys leaving and i didnt have a partner  marisha its fine dont worry about it  sam you can come with us /none/ if you like  laura but i feel like you guys are noticeable and why would i be this really beautiful woman leaving  with the stinky guy  sam its quickly becoming canon that you just have shit smeared all over you you could travel  with me i could be your daughter  laura youre my daughter  sam yes were a couple and hes our guard or something i dont know  laura yeah you leave after us caleb okay  liam isnt it simpler for you to walk on yourself like a beautiful woman  laura /tavern/ no me and nott are going to go together okay come on nott  sam im sorry shes very forward  laura come on sweetie lets go  sam yes mommy  laura and we walk out  matt you guys dont have to make a performance check because youve exited before and youre  completely visually a different individual so you guys pass through without an issue caleb you can  follow up behind as you are not currently under direct guard in the tavern they do notice you  exit and theyre aware of your presence but you /tavern/ are not confined to the tavern so you guys all  manage to slowly come together a few blocks down and out of the sight of the crownsguard guarding  the nestled nook inn and where are you off to  laura we did it where should we go  travis lets just keep walking for now  laura okay should we walk toward the carnival where the zombies were  taliesin who was he would be my question  laura oh right we should find out where hes from how do we do that should we ask around and /none/  say hey anybody know where the old guy came from that turned into a zombie  travis thats a good point  taliesin seems to be the most appropriate thing to ask at this point  liam well we could find some public places and just gossip a bit see if anybody has heard of  him if a friend has died at the circus last night  marisha i mean you mentioned no sick people if he was sick sometimes that word gets around  travis maybe there is a morgue maybe they recognized him  taliesin these /none/ small towns most everyone knows everybody else  laura lets go to is there a market area  matt they dont have a large bazaar but there is an area that is generally where a lot of the  simple wares and vegetables and meats and people who sell small things that they craft their own  at its a small market if you want to make an investigation check  laura 16  matt okay by going around asking questions and inquiring and trying to prod people to talk about  what transpired the night before the information you /none/ gather involves the man who passed away his  name is enon brinjay  liam grimjay  matt brinjay hes a standard human being in his early 80s hes old but healthy it seemed  travis was he in good health  matt seemed to be in good health for his age  liam so our war against the old continues  matt apparently  taliesin were the logans run of dd  matt he seemed to have been retired for quite some time but had been making little bits here  and there helping the fishermen move fish to /town/ and from the outside of the lake he wasnt really  well known the reason people are talking about him now is because the word is gotten around and  gossiped about but for the most part he was one of the many faceless people that live in the town  a handful knew his name  taliesin retired fisherman  marisha he was helping  taliesin do we know where he was retired from and where he was staying maybe where he was drinking  he had to go somewhere  matt actually he was known often to be /tavern/ drinking at the old mud hole tavern  taliesin is that with the weird e spelling  matt no just old  taliesin im always a fan  matt i know  laura ye olde  taliesin ye olde its pronounced the when you see the ye  travis i should point out this is the second connection to the ustaloch  taliesin the what  travis well before we met up with you two we fought off a wicked sick water snake  laura it came up out of the lake for some reason  taliesin is this a /none/ metaphor or is this actually a real thing  laura it really happened i almost died  marisha i punched a snake to death  laura she did  sam there were the snakes in the circus last night but it wasnt related to the attack i  suppose  laura a little different  liam how long of a snake are we talking about  marisha oh it was a giant water snake then the little girls were complaining about more and more  instances of these snakes coming out of the lake  sam and this fellow who /tavern/ died worked with the fishermen in the lake  laura well he took some jobs with them did anybody see him the day of the carnival was he  working with anyone that day  matt you dont find any of that information that would be an intense investigation you would have  to go beyond asking questions around a market  sam is the lake within the city limits  marisha yeah  matt its technically considered part of the city it might not be an issue  laura wheres ye olde mud hole tavern at  matt the /tavern/ mud hole tavern youve been to before  taliesin i was doing my rounds  matt yeah when you first entered the city so you can  marisha the lochward is that what were talking about  matt the lochward is where the old mud hole would be at the lochward is to the eastern side of the  entire city the lochward is the central one  liam the wards border the lake  matt so you make your way to the old mud hole entering inside this is a dark dive of a bar  youve been there /tavern/ once before it smells heavily of old wet wood ale stains and peanut its a  very small area and of the four tables that are there they are mostly empty except for one old  man who is sitting there in the process of playing a game of solitaire with his cards and a man in  his 30s thumbing through a book who would be the barkeep if there were more patrons at the moment  hes flipping through and glances up and gives you a look as you enter can i help you are you  looking /none/ for drinks can i get you anything  liam yeah i would really love a drink and i sit down next to him what do you have i need  something heavier than a trost ive had enough trosts to last me a lifetime  matt we have liquor  liam i will take your liquor  matt i will get some whiskey for you then whiskey everyone  marisha sure  sam two please  laura its okay shes my daughter she loves whiskey i dont even remember what voice i was doing  laughing  matt make a /none/ deception check  laura i let her have any whiskey she wants oh thats pretty good 17  taliesin weve been doing a pub crawl  matt he goes and lines up a few small containers fills whiskey for all of you all right that  will be eight silver for the batch  liam i have that i pull out eight silver oh wait silver did you say i do not have eight  silver  laura its okay i have it  liam you do  laura sure  highpitched voice i mean sure  matt he takes /none/ the silver and puts it away slides the drinks to the rest of you and goes back to his  book and starts thumbing through again  liam honestly its been a terrible 24 hours we were at the circus last night and i did not know  him well but old man brinjay fell  matt he looks up and goes enon its sad to see him go and many of us were wondering what day it  was going to be  liam did you know him  matt he came in here most every day to drink /none/ hes a lonely man  liam it was a terrible way to go im sorry  matt doesnt bother me one way or the other just sad to lose a patron  laura do you know who was talking to him the day of the carnival  matt i dont recall sometimes he would tell stories to whoever was willing to listen and not  most were willing to listen  laura was he here that day  matt yesterday  laura yeah  matt i think he came in briefly for a drink before the carnival but that was /none/ it  marisha you know we should drink to old stories of brinjay  travis shushes  taliesin i down my shot what did the man drink out of curiosity what was his final drink im a  bit of a macabre person myself  matt its this very whiskey you just had  taliesin ill take one more and ill get one of my own  liam i heard he was sick too  matt i dont believe he was ill i hope not he seemed to be rather wasting away you shouldnt be  doing so much manual /none/ labor at that age  sam what labor was he doing  matt he carries stuff around from small tasks to  sam down at the docks  matt the docks up at the north ward he carried crates boxes just odd jobs ways to get by til  the end of his days which now that theyve come may he rest and not have to do odd jobs ever  again he pours his own bit of whiskey  all cheers  laura do you know who he was doing odd jobs for that day  sam your lady /dung/ voice is worse than mine  matt to be honest if he did i wasnt paying attention  liam im sure his family will miss him very much  matt theres nobody nearby he had a son about 35 years ago but he got married and went up  north  travis did he work for any of the particular breweries around  matt i dont know maybe  marisha brinjay  laura where did he sit in here  matt he points over to the not the table the guy is playing solitaire on but the empty table to /none/  the right of him usually right there in the corner  laura i go sit in the corner im going to look for anything i can find that looks like an old man was  touching it  matt okay make an investigation check  laura okay im really good at these 12  matt 12 it looks like probably old person touching has been all over here yes the table is  very old and warped in places stains all over it its not a very good table its seen some rough  days  travis if we /none/ were to go down to the docks and ask after a few people he worked with is there anyone  you know that we should speak to familiar of his  matt i apologize i served him drinks and pretended to listen to him many times but i  wasnt really paying attention  travis i understand that  marisha is there anyone who did that wasnt hypothetical  matt maybe i apologize i spend most of my days reading he lifts the book  marisha whats the book  sam you read  liam subtle guys  taliesin we /none/ got a reader while theyre doing this im going to saunter over to the card  player  liam can i see whats on the spine of that book from where i am  matt at a glance at it its in zemnian which you can read the translation would come about to  the rosed embrace  marisha a romance novel  matt probably  laura is fabio on the cover  liam hows your trashy novel is it a good one no judgement  matt its not trashy its very tasteful  liam oh no im fluent in /none/ zemnian ive read all of his works  matt have you  liam mutual fan  matt i didnt realize there was another samuel fan in here which is your favorite  liam i love the farthings embrace  matt i havent read that one  liam its an early one he actually did it under a pseudonym he did a whole series under that  pseudonym short stories  matt what is it again he goes over and grabs a piece of chalk in the back and starts it was  liam farthings embrace  matt mein gott i /town/ did not know about this i may have to send out zadash and see if we can find  some of those books thank you  liam youre a big reader or just samuel  matt just recently samuel i read on occasion it depends on what you can find  liam i read a lot but all ive been able to find in this town is that parchment place  matt the parchment place is good for trash if youre looking for unique stuff theres a few  places you can go  liam here in town  matt /town/ here in town yeah if youre having a hard time finding a specific book i would recommend  going to burnished bibelots  liam burnished bibelots which ward is that in  matt that is in the north ward just on the outskirts of the main market street its a bit of  a cluttered mess but oglen would be happy to help you  liam oglen  matt oglen  liam that is good to know thank you  matt not to worry  liam those are hard to find the farthings embrace  matt i imagine so it /none/ cant be that bad  liam he wasnt as proud of them early work and all that  matt of course i have a contact in rexxentrum if i cannot find it in zadash i will get it from rexxentrum  liam that would be the place  matt whats your name  liam my name is caleb  matt caleb pleasure to meet you i am vosna  travis thank you for the drink vosna ill be taking my leave now  matt of course if anybody else is a reader as well come by and talk sometime  /none/ taliesin not there at all  liam this has been quite a day  laura is there pictures in highpitched voice is there pictures  matt pictures are up in here  laura oh sounds exciting  liam i sneak my undrunk whiskey to nott  sam i take out my flask from my leg unscrew it and pour it in  matt okay  laura what do you guys think should we stay here should we go somewhere else  travis we got to get molly  taliesin i just sat down for a moment with this solitaire player /none/  matt correct  taliesin they say that solitaire is the game for the deathobsessed theres inevitability to every  hand most of them are doomed from the start no matter what you do any interest to buck fate and  try your hand at an opponent for once no money just friendly  i slide the rest of my whiskey over  matt are you a devil  taliesin ive been called worse  matt i dont play with devils  taliesin im just a man who saw another man die yesterday its been heavy on my conscience and /none/ i  was just wondering if there was anything you could tell me about enon  matt enon wanted to go to that bloody circus  taliesin im regretting it myself  matt i told him not to go stupid it is for the common folk and the young hes always had his  head in the clouds  taliesin has he thats not what other people have said  matt other people are stupid  taliesin why do you think he went why do you think that happened to him  matt hes lonely dont trust the carnival nothing /none/ but spooks and magicians and things that  want to take your life and take your money take your family whisk you away fuck the circus  taliesin fuck the circus so thats what you think happened to him then i feel like theres  something evil afoot  matt says the devil  taliesin again ive been called worse sure you have in your time as well  matt he takes the drink sips it dont come round here no more  taliesin i take my cup back down it i love small towns  marisha shithead  travis /none/ we head outside well that was revealing  sam was it  marisha we learned a few things actually hes a prime target perfect victim perfect candidate  no one really paid attention to him he was old he had no family his sons gone  taliesin awfully convenient  marisha awfully convenient still awfully convenient that your little circus doesnt allow  the elderly which you never fully explained and he happened to be one of the oldest people in that  circus where did that rule come from the sick makes sense i asked you that  before /none/ but why elderly  taliesin that rules been around for as long as i can remember because it makes people think the  shows dangerous gives them a thrill  travis youre worried about them having a heart attack or something  taliesin were not really worried about people having a heart attack we want people to be  worried about having a heart attack because then theyre more excited to come see the show this is  how these shows work  marisha do you know who implemented that rule  taliesin before my time  laura in his /town/ defense every carnival ive gone to has said no sick people no old people  taliesin its a boilerplate  marisha still a good candidate  taliesin if you were trying to hide doing something to someone its a great candidate if i  was trying to get away with something terrible idea  marisha or if you were trying to frame someone seems to be a lot of pretty bigoted people in this  town who dont like tieflings and other strange lots jester you actually said one of the  smartest things of the night which is you /none/ did yeah which is guards really weird  laura right  marisha yeah  taliesin wait what  laura the guards are really weird  marisha the crownsguards as you were saying the ustaloch  taliesin what kind of weird  laura like you know they what kind of weird  laughter  marisha they seem to be the one connecting throughline also whats her name norda  mentioned that she didnt want to let you lot in but made an exception i dont know if i wanted  to do something and if i already knew a bunch of /town/ people were upset and angry at a circus and  strange people coming in its easy framing in my opinion  travis she makes a valid point actually  laura oh if people are scared of carnivals they wont want them in the future  travis bingo  marisha that or if youre up to no good and you dont want to get caught blame it on the easy  frame the weirdos who just rolled into town  laura great so we just need to investigate the guards  travis that might be harder to do maybe we go /town/ down to the lochward  taliesin start at the docks but ill keep that in mind  marisha i dont know it might not be the guards there might be another throughline  that were missing  laura do we need to question the guards  sam that sounds terrible  laura maybe we should tell them they cant leave town  marisha ooh thats a good idea yeah maybe when they question us  laura we turn it around  marisha and laura yeah  marisha i like that  taliesin i was about nope nevermind  laura what /none/  taliesin i was about to be very impressed but i take it back  marisha aw  travis how far is it from where we are to the lochward  matt you guys are technically in the lochward its a quick jaunt over to the edge of the ustaloch  marisha so the ustaloch is the docks its what they called the ward or its the lake  matt its the giant lake that the docks are up against the city is built against this giant  kidney beanshaped lake  marisha what does usta mean what does usta /none/ come from  matt do you speak zemnian  marisha you speak zemnian  liam i do speak zemnian  taliesin what does usta mean  liam it means  matt do you know  liam do i know  matt i just wanted to fuck with you  liam its been a while but osten means lake no its not lake lake  matt essentially it just means an east lake  liam and marisha east lake  taliesin very good  matt not too complicated  marisha all right  taliesin id like to avoid the guards for /none/ as long as possible  marisha agreed  travis lets head down to the docks keeping an eye out for crownsguard  matt as you guys make your way towards the ustaloch and the dockward there well go and take  a break well be back in a few minutes well continue to unveil this mystery  sam this

to you congratulations  marisha i love how we just went through every rain song in about 30 seconds  matt yeah we did most of them as you guys make your way across the streets of the lochward you  find yourself to the docks which are about five or six main dock structures that protrude anywhere  from ten to 30 or so feet into the loch itself there are no major ships the biggest river that  exits the loch /none/ heads towards the mountains so there is no direct path to the inlet all the  boats in here are small fishermens boats theyre designed specifically for the lake for freshwater  fishing and whatever needs to be transferred from bank to bank as you approach you can see a good  amount of the boats are still out on the water you can look out and see the outline of them  against the horizon you see a couple of small landmasses in the center of the loch that are  barely out of view you approach and the /dung/ first couple of fishermen that walk past you both look  to be hardened in their years their skin is very battered by the sun its wrinkled and dark from  constant beating of the sky upon them they glance over at this uniquelooking troupe as they  approach they stop and dont say anything they just look at you like what are you doing here  laura do we still have disguise self up  matt you have it for maybe ten more minutes  marisha oh shit  travis do we see any kings guard crownsguard  matt /town/ crownsguard make a perception check  laura 11  travis 11 same  matt glancing about you dont see any crownsguard in the immediate vicinity of the  lochward youve seen them they patrol the town and walk through ward to ward but you dont see  any at the moment no  laura looks like were ahead of them in the investigation  marisha hey jester do you happen to remember the name of that guy whose daughter we saved from  the snake  laura oh shit  marisha yeah  laura lets see if i wrote it /none/ down in my sketchbook  marisha yeah because i didnt write it down  laura king bertrand  travis no  laura okay what about no i know that guy nope i didnt  marisha damn it  matt you remember where he lives mostly because you were there  marisha thats true  laura we could go by there  marisha we could go by he seems to like us  laura he worked out there right  marisha and laura yeah  matt you guys make your way along the edge of the loch to the outside of /none/ the fishermans house the  house is currently being repaired you can see in the main doorway the door is off the hinges and  theres a large pile of ruined furniture and cabinets that have been shifted out of the  building you can also see a long serpentine body that is currently being skinned by a younger  man probably 14 or 15 hes in the process of carving the skin off of it this thing is about 20  to 25 feet long  marisha thats the snake i punched  liam thats your work thats impressive /none/ you took it all by yourself  marisha well no they helped me im not an egomaniac they fucking helped me  liam but i saw your guns last night you probably took the lead  marisha give credit to the whole damn group move on  travis flattery got you nowhere  taliesin im comparing the snake to the snake thats tattooed on my hand to try and get the  heads to be the exact same size  liam we have been in the woods for too long ive forgotten how to talk to people  sam your /tavern/ game is really suffering  marisha thanks for the damn compliment  matt as you approach the young man with this large sharpened knife it looks like it may have  been a heavy butchering knife that hes using to fillet and pull the skin off the snake looks back  at you guys and doesnt know whats going on you hear a voice go hey you look up and you see  the fisherman that you saw before the one who came to you guys in the tavern hes up on top of  the roof and hes currently /none/ boarding some portions of it it looks like a part of the roof  had been damaged in the fray he goes hold on gets up and comes down the ladder on the side and  approaches you can see hes sweating im so sorry i didnt know you were coming what can i  do for you  marisha sorry for dropping in  laura do we look like ourselves yet  matt no actually this is an interesting point  travis damn it  sam wait none of you look the same  matt thats right no thank /none/ you for reminding me he comes out and he goes how can i help  you  laughter  laura its us  marisha yeah its me i pull the hat off and pull my hair up its beauregard we killed your  snake  laura in normal voice pretend that i dont talk in human accent pretend that i dont talk  like this  travis fuck it i drop disguise self  matt he goesah  travis im sorry to deceive you  matt im very confused  marisha oh no dont worry about it what was your /none/ name friend  matt rinaldo  marisha rinaldo thats what it was i knew it was an r okay rinaldo  travis rinaldo this snake that was in your house is not the only strange occurrence thats been  happening were trying to find out the cause of it have you seen anything else like this in the  time thats passed  matt no weve been doing repairs on the house and getting everything underway this is the first  thing thats come on this side most of them live toward the center of the lake and stay underwater /none/  its been two in the last few months that have come up its a bit of a nuisance  laura have you seen any zombies coming out of the lake  matt zombies what are you talking about  travis were asking after a man that helped down at the docks named enon have you heard of him  matt enon  travis enon  matt yeah i worked with him a couple times he comes through looking for work asking to see  whats available  liam you obviously have not heard the news from the traveling circus /town/ in town from last night  matt no thats the big blue tent right  liam thats correct  matt no whats going on  laura whispering enon turned into a zombie  sam what  laura louder enon turned into a zombie whispering and was killed  sam what  matt im sorry to hear that thats terrible wow thats really terrible im sorry  travis we were trying to see if he might have worked with people that might have known what he  was doing that day earlier  matt i havent seen him at the docks /town/ in a while not for a week at least  travis and laura really  liam is there anything out of the ordinary from the past week or two that comes to mind anything  off about the runofthemill stuff  matt other than a giant fucking snake ruining my house but not that comes to mind no circus  coming into town thats a little weird  travis i see youre skinning the beast can i ask why  matt im not going to let it go to waste thats some good meat some good skin  marisha you /town/ mentioned the circus coming to town as weird why  matt because theres a circus in town  liam he just means out of the ordinary yeah  matt yeah we dont get many shows and traveling folk last time this was here a year ago it came  and went in a week  sam you said you hadnt seen this hi you said you hadnt seen this person in a week was that  unusual  matt no i didnt keep up with him he came through every now and then i had a little cash  and /dung/ needed some help hauling things around i asked for his assistance he was an old fella and  it was less that he was helpful and more that we wanted to help when we could  travis if we went down to the docks where he worked is there anyone that we should ask for to  speak to who might have known him better  matt your guess is as good as mine to be fair although were a community were also relatively  competitive you understand  travis i do  taliesin you think anyone would have wanted /tavern/ him marked or harmed in some way  matt i dont think so hes an old man i havent seen or heard anyone his disposition  seemed positive enough if a little sad and lonely  travis if you think of anything or if you hear anyone speak about him you can find us at the  nestled nook inn wed appreciate anything if it happens to reach your ears  matt of course let me finish up here with the roof and ill ask around see if anything comes up  travis much obliged  marisha hows your little /none/ girl doing sorry i cover my beard  matt it just wasnt expected  marisha sorry  matt no shes doing great shes been a little spooked but she slept well last night shes  doing fine thank you again for what you guys did for me  laura youre welcome  sam what for what  laura we saved a little girl  sam oh yes thats right  laura if you see any zombies please let us know  matt i will you were so kind to help me when i saw a snake i figure if i /none/ see a zombie youd  also be helpful  laura we would definitely we already killed a zombie too  taliesin this is just a snake this is a big weird snake im looking at  matt you can inspect it if you want  taliesin no ive been looking at the snake this entire time  laura oh we have one of its fangs i pulled it out  matt make a nature check  sam ooh dont do those much either  marisha i have a fang too right  taliesin nine  matt nine you dont know /dung/ much about snake biology its hard to tell if its out of the  ordinary its just a big snake  taliesin looks like mine  laura only bigger  taliesin much bigger  travis shall we  laura fuck sure  sam we are the best detectives ever  laura i feel like we are really doing bad at this detective thing  travis we should probably wrap up whatever were doing i imagine theyre going to come by the inn  soon and try and speak with us not you two  sam we didnt leave any sort /tavern/ of ferris buellery thing  travis nope no stuffed beds no recordings on the old vhs  matt what are you guys doing where are you going  sam is there anywhere else that we need to inspect the carnival or more docks stuff  laura i feel like going back to the carnival is probably a bad idea  taliesin id say the docks are his home if we could figure out where he lived  sam where he was last seen  taliesin he was last seen at the circus  laura rinaldo  matt yeah  laura /none/ do you know where enon lives  matt i cant say i do im sorry my apologies wish i could be of more help  laura its okay  taliesin you dont happen to know what happened to his son by any chance  matt i didnt even know he had a son  laura see were better investigators than this guy  sam but hes not trying to investigate  taliesin i take the compliment im putting it my pocket im keeping it for later  matt he climbs back up the ladder to the roof  marisha im /none/ starting to think that following enons story isnt necessarily going to lead us  here he seems like a random victim  laura hey 14 year old kid  matt he has this puffy red fro going on he looks pale fresh to this scrawny hes stopped  drawing his blade across the snake yeah  laura do you live here  matt no i live about three houses up  laura did you go to the carnival  matt last night yeah i was there  laura okay where were you at the carnival  matt i actually snuck /town/ in under the tent after it had started  laura right thats a good thing were you close to enon in the show were you on that side or the  other side did you see the zombie  matt i saw him a little bit he was in the front and i had people in front of me but i think i saw  some of it it was pretty cool  laura it was kind of crazy right have you heard any ghost stories around town lately about scary  things happening  matt my grandma told me /none/ a ghost story years ago about these giant badger creatures that live on  the hills of the ashkeeper that can stand up on their hind legs and they come down and they eat  kids that dont go to bed in time  laura oh shit those guys are scary ive heard of them you should be really careful have you  heard anything about zombies  matt no not since that  liam whats up  laura caleb has seen some shit  matt i have to finish the  laura hey listen if you hear any other /town/ ghost stories you come and find us okay  matt okay  laura all right  laughter  marisha are we just going from person to person in town telling them to come find us  sam we are really terrible at this  taliesin well shes making friends with everybody i dont see any of you making friends  travis im a little concerned that weve been gone for a while  marisha yeah maybe we should get back  travis maybe let these two that arent under house arrest  sam continue the investigation or go back  /town/ travis no continue i mean if youre up for it  sam yeah yeah well be a regular  liam yeah weve done nothing wrong were not sweating it im not sweating  laura yeah i believe you completely that was very believable im going to give you another  blessing before you leave okay  liam what are you talking about none of us did anything none of us we protected the people of  this town  laura its true  liam it is true  laura i know  liam thats easy lets go solve a mystery /tavern/ nott  sam all right  taliesin were you being sarcastic oh no you werent okay catching up on that  marisha so kids dont know anything about this old people dont know anything about this  travis tavernkeeper doesnt know anything about this  taliesin only the pure of heart make their answer out of riddles back to the tavern  marisha but pure of heart still going back to the guards thing back to the tavern lets go  sam were we just on the docks  matt yeah you guys were at the docks  liam we /tavern/ came up with bupkus  laura we didnt ask anybody we went straight to the house  sam okay well walk around the docks and look for  travis well see you back at the inn  sam all right  laura should we run back or should we saunter back  taliesin youre going to probably you know poof  marisha yeah how much time does she have  liam about a minute  matt yeah its about to fade  laura yeah i figured it had already happened probably midway talking to the kid  matt probably  /tavern/ marisha maybe super stealthily back  laura all right i put my hood up  taliesin i can maybe put a rope through the window  marisha yeah thats a good idea  laura is it a twostory  matt its a twostory you guys are up in the second story  taliesin i got rope  laura lets do that yeah well sneak around the back of the inn and try to climb up the upstairs  window  travis i can keep them busy at the front door  taliesin ill go through the front like a proper /none/ person  matt all right so you guys are setting up a rope to climb up the back you go in on your own up  to the top you put a rope through  marisha fjords distracting  laura in the front then were going to try to sneak  taliesin right and then im going to drop some of the rope out the back window for them  matt easy enough to do so those of you who want to wait and can take the rope up you wait for a  moment where nobodys watching and climb /tavern/ your way up into the inn safely and get to your rooms you  two what are you doing  taliesin singing 50 feet of hemp rope its a standard  liam hey kiddo do you want a piggyback  sam sure that sounds like a good idea  liam scramble up lets go talk to some people  sam all right ill jump on calebs back  matt all right  liam ill wander down to where people are working where people are moving crates around  marisha hes on calebs back  matt okay that would be probably /none/ closer to the northward  liam okay so thats the plan is to look for people moving crap around the same way that enon  is said to have so thats what well do  matt okay make an investigation check  liam all right  sam shall i help or no  matt if you want to  liam not that great  matt you aiding him would give him an advantage in the roll  liam oh that didnt help 12 for me  matt you take a couple hours wandering through the northward asking questions and most /none/ of the  information you get is they have no idea who that is or like ah he died its about time  liam and theres no point even asking questions because weve asked them all for two hours yeah  matt id say yeah based on that roll  liam okay well thats a big zero you want to go book shopping with me  sam sure  liam okay i believe that gentleman said that the burnished bibliots was in the northward correct  matt i believe you are correct yeah its in the southern portion of the /none/ northward by where it  borders the lochward  liam okay so ill start asking questions to get us there  matt easily enough you eventually are led to it and you come to a closet thats affixed to another  building the wood used are almost driftwood and heavily weathered and the front door is closed as  you approach it looks like a glorified storage shed that has been bolted and put up against  another structure  liam all right well i will walk up to the door and knock on it  matt okay knocks no /none/ response  liam is there any breaks in the door or the building or cracks that frumpkin could fit into  matt visual glance there look like theres that space underneath the door  probably not enough for a cat to slip through  liam are there any windows or anything or is it all a big dirty dingy mess  matt there are windows but if you look at the back of the windows all you see is scraps of  material stacks of books piles of boxes and crates its literally blocked out with things  stacked up /town/ against it from the interior  liam how busy is the front of this place  matt not busy at all its just the two of you right now standing at the front door  liam no ones around us though  matt its not on the main street its a little pushed back recessed about ten or 15 feet from  the main road so theres no one immediately around you but there are people walking back and forth  on the road behind but youre out in the open per se  sam and no ones coming to /none/ the door  matt no ones come to the door yet no  sam want me to break in  liam yes no  knocking  matt okay a moment passes and you hear hold on the door opens it was open theres the  sound of heavy sacks go tumbling down to the interior of it and you glance around and you hear  a voice go can i help you  liam hello  matt you look down and theres this crotchetylooking scrawny old gnome whos sitting  there in the doorway hes got this vibrant puff like /none/ a cotton ball of hair around his head but  its this perfect u of bald on top no glasses eyes are very small and beady and he has this  bulbous round nose at the front with this little bit of a tuft of chin white hair that matches the  cotton ball tuft on the sides hes sitting there clutching the top of the knob on the inside which  is actually affixed shorter on the door and he goes well come in  liam yes please youre open for business i take it  matt always open /none/ come on in  liam all right  matt turns around and musters his way inside as soon as you step in the door and look around this  place looks like an episode of hoarders it is just floortoceiling walltowall stacks of  anything and everything knickknacks small stuffed animals toys books glasses and  goblets it is the biggest crammed fleamarket into a small shedlike space youve seen  sam i start unscrewing my flask  laughing  liam frumpkin climbs back up onto notts shoulder and nestles in  matt meowing  liam i am scouting the /none/ city for books i am starved for books  matt well weve got books here  liam yes sir im sorry what is your name  matt oglen oglen hornsblower  liam oglen hornsblower  matt and welcome to my collection you want to buy something let me know  liam well i see you sell a great many things in here books included this is just things youve  collected throughout your lifetime  matt right boughten traded for found  liam i dont know what you just said but i am interested in books particularly in the arcane /none/  realm but any kind of book do you have anything that you just outright know is out of the  ordinary  matt im sure weve got a few look around see what you find its half the fun half the  journey  liam all right friend lets its like winters crest morning for me and im scanning the  shelves  matt make an investigation check  sam can you give me something to look for to distract me and give me a mission to go on  please  liam yes you want to find some /none/ sort of tool that helps you do what you do best  sam all right  liam investigation check that is a 21  matt 21  sam i rolled a 21 investigation check  matt all right  sam im just looking for baubles to steal  laughter  matt all right in thumbing through there are plenty of books that within a first glance  this is not of interest to me you have to move things out of the way and push things aside  the smell in there is dusty and moldy  and you do /none/ find there is  some subtle water damage and some mildew growing  in one far corner and youre like ugh put that back however you rolled really high two things  catch your eye one there appears to be the remnants of some sort of notebook a sketchbook  that is written in a language you do not understand what languages do you know  liam well off the bat i dont know where that is in dd beyond yet but if i open up my binder i  bet i have a paper version that i can verify /none/ with i speak sylvan common and celestial and i also  can comprehend languages as a ritual spell but i think that takes some time  matt it does take ten minutes  liam ten minutes  matt but you glance through the book and while you cannot read the text you do recognize that  there are elements at the back of the book that have a hint of arcane nature thats one of two  books you find with that roll  sam its like the adult section for him  matt i know the second book you /none/ find is written in zemnian which you can read  liam thats correct  matt the title translates to fiends of folklore  liam im so happy you have quite a shop here  matt i know i do  liam you have some real treasures im particularly interested in both of these books  matt good choices good choices  liam i dont know though i dont think that i mean im rather tight on coin at the moment so  matt thats too bad  liam maybe my eyes are too big for my stomach  matt hes /none/ pulling the books away from you  liam how much would you part with these for  matt sniffs he holds of the fiends of folklore book three gold pieces this one sniffs  ten gold pieces  liam which one is which  matt the fiends of folklore is the three the other tome  liam the arcane weird one  matt youre not quite sure whats in it  liam okay would you have any interest in a magic cat  matt im sorry  liam frumpkin disappears from on notts shoulder reappears next to the little man /none/  matt yelps he like throws the books and grabs nearby this large sack and starts  angrily beating the cat  liam ill take that as a no  travis childhood cat destroyed  matt he does hit frumpkin frumpkin takes one point of bludgeoning damage  liam that might be it i dont really know i didnt think that this would happen so quickly  travis faced with our own mortality  laura frumpkin point two  marisha yeah he updates overnight as long as hes plugged in right  liam hold on i have to see if /none/ frumpkin is still here  travis must be plugged in and connected to wifi  marisha type in your passcode if you agree to the terms  liam one hit point of damage  matt yes  liam hes still here  matt there you go frumpkin immediately darts off jumps on your shoulder turns around and  hisses  liam so you dont like cats i understand that  matt sorry it caught me offguard  liam well i was trying to sample the merchandise for you because if it was just a cat it was just  a /none/ cat but this one changes to my other shoulder hes a magic cat  matt okay  liam you can roll him in mud he comes back clean he disappears he reappears he brings you  things  matt can you make him go away  liam gone  matt thank you now we can continue to talk money  liam heres what i propose i do not have ten gold at the moment but it doesnt feel like you  get a lot of thoroughfare here so im going to come back to purchase this later thats it  /none/ thats the end of my spiel thats all ive got im interested and thank you for giving me the  time  matt of course sorry about your cat friend  liam its okay nott  sam have i heard all of this conversation  matt youve been hearing all of it but youve also found amongst the chaos a brass baby bottle  thats fairly dented but its very shiny and polished you can already see on the inside you  find a new flask actually its very tarnished but you spit and rub it a little bit it /none/ looks to  be of very fine metallic material youre not entirely sure youd have to clean it but it  looks like very nice quality material  sam all right ill try to trade my flask with that flask  matt make a sleight of hand check  travis indiana jones style  sam 22  taliesin how  sam wait more no thats right 22  matt now your flask which still has liquor in it is left behind for the empty flask you  receive however without an instance of anyone even paying attention it is yours /none/ you can write  in your inventory you are now the owner of a platinum flask  all ooh  sam shit okay its a baby bottle or maybe a rattle whatd you say  matt baby bottle looks like it was used as a bottle for a very upperclass family  taliesin youre already so ahead though  sam i know but i cant resist ill try to take one more look and pocket that as well  matt make another sleight of hand check please  sam 20  matt it just vanishes into your cloak its the /none/ craziest thing it was there and its gone  travis yes  sam are we going to leave now should we leave i think we should leave maybe we should go

look all  around what are your hours here as i look to see if there is anything besides that book  anything  matt you glance throughout the interior and you dont sense anything magical unfortunately  within the piles of rubble  liam besides the book he put down  matt the books not radiating any magical aura but he answers oh all hours i dont really  close i dont really sleep  liam middle of the night even  matt sure  liam all right business is /none/ business thank you  matt no worries see you then  liam bis später  matt pee shmiter  liam that guy does not speak zemnian  matt no he does not

taliesin that was a power move right there  travis thank you  matt you guys return to the inn  sam /none/ i guess we do  matt yes you do  sam well that was terrible no one found out anything it was a waste of a day were all  terrible at this goodnight  laura what time is it  marisha thats not true i still say that some of the best information that you can get can be in  the information that you dont find  sam that is nonsense  marisha im just saying sometimes the lack of information can be a process of elimination  travis sure  marisha its super broad  taliesin no /none/ you know what im going to take it  marisha im trying to be fucking silver lining so i dont feel like a piece of shit for waste a  day and you guys are shitting on that but its fine  travis you found nothing at the docks zip zero  liam we spent hours there no one knew anything about the old man  marisha see no one knew anything about him that means prime candidate someones little  experiment little frankenstein im telling you  liam i dont really understand what shes saying  laura i dont /dung/ either im going to run up and down the stairs for a while  matt quick footsteps  taliesin how long have you known

comes up im sorry can you please stop  laura okay  matt thank you  sam hey dungeon master  matt yes  sam the other night when nott was out carousing a bit while caleb /none/ was asleep he saw some figures  in cloaks dash by was there any distinctive anything about these three figures that  dashed by  matt not that you noticed unfortunately  sam damn it okay i will share that information with the group i saw some weirdos running  around  laura when  sam the other night when he was asleep  travis how late  sam two in the morning  liam you were out that late  sam sorry  laura maybe we should go out at two oclock in the morning and see if we /town/ can find them  marisha ooh thats a good idea  laura follow them  marisha you guys notice that its weird that no ones actually really talking about this this is  a small town i come from a small town small town people gossip  taliesin i feel like there should be some more gossip then there is thats very true  marisha someone is talking about this we just havent found them yet 200am field trip  laura we can always leave through the window this time  marisha mmhmm i like that  travis i can /none/ be down for that  taliesin i leave the rope tied in here can we use your cat reel it back up in so that theres  no trace of us until we need to get back there  liam are you asking for my cat to haul up our rope  taliesin no im telling you that your cat is going to haul up a rope  laura how is a cat going to lift up a rope  taliesin its not that heavy of a rope its just hemp  matt hemp rope can be pretty heavy  /none/ taliesin well if i throw it back up there then i imagine you cat can knock it back down at the very  least  laura there that would work maybe  marisha oh is he like an asshole cat  taliesin i assume hes an asshole cat arent all cats asshole cats  matt this is true  laura it might be down before we come back is the thing  taliesin i assume hes going to thats fair  travis where were you when you saw these cloaked figures  sam i had gone out to do some /none/ window shopping  travis at 200am  sam yes i wasnt very successful i had walked by the general store  laura oh we went there  marisha yeah we did  sam i passed by a place called natural remedies herbs and medicinal things i went by a spot named  jackalwere its a smithy  laura okay but where did you see the cloaked guys  sam it was between i dont remember  matt it was one block north of the natural remedies  marisha natural remedies what was the other one jackalwere  sam i think /town/ that was what it was called  matt yeah jackalwere smiths  sam we could do a little stakeout  travis we could  marisha thats true how do people send messages in this town have we figured that out  sam probably by foot or by horse right  taliesin not that big of a town  travis should someone stay up well i was thinking someone should keep a lookout on the roof  of the inn in case someone comes for us while everyone else is out  laura how would we let anybody know  travis /none/ i dont know can you conjure those golden orbs up into the air as like a signal  liam its pretty limited they dont go that far  travis maybe we just risk it  sam yeah  laura lets risk it  travis its 200am im sure everybody will be asleep lets risk it  marisha before we leave  is there a window in the hall or are there only windows in our bedrooms  matt there is no window in the hall only in the rooms  marisha okay thats fine on our side of the room /none/  matt you have three rooms between you  taliesin theres three rooms and they all have windows  matt correct  marisha on our side of the door im going to take out my healers kit do i have any bandages  or medical tape or anything like that  matt not medical tape but there are clean strips of cloth and some adhesive bandages basic  general  laura no tape  marisha im going to tie a bandage ever so lightly around one side of the handle onto  something on to the other side of the /none/ door if theres something like a lamp or some kind of pipe  or something i can tie it to  laura so that well know if someone tried to come in the room  marisha correct  laura okay  matt you can pull one bandage out and affix to one of the chair legs nearby you could do that  taliesin oh for gods sake i pull out a big thing of string  marisha okay yeah ill take some string and just some twine and  laura what are we going to do leave through our window /none/  marisha yeah  laura to their window  marisha well i figured were all in the same room at this point  liam what are you trying to do  marisha im trying to make sure that if someone tries to come in our room well know if they come in  liam i can take care of that  taliesin oh well then im taking my string back  marisha what can you do  liam i have some magic for that  sam yeah he has a magical spell that alerts you when someone tries to break /none/ in your room  liam that is correct yeah i will take a moment to do that and it will let me know  sam best part is it doesnt alert him when i sneak in or out  liam that you know of  sam wait what  liam one mile of the warded area  sam ooh  marisha thats better lets do that  liam i just need ten minutes and i pull out a little spool of silvered thread and stretch it  out where did you want this over the window  marisha well i /none/ was going to say in the door but if theres maybe a place in the hall  liam well i can do the entire room really i can go doorknob to the funny thing about this  thread theres no end to it so i start looping it all the way around the room and tie it off and  take out one of my books from the holster the one on the left side and i open it up you guys watch  as i spend ten minutes referring to the book and tracing symbols on the floor along /none/ underneath  the thread and about ten minutes of time nothing happens but thats taken care of  laura nice  sam see hes really good  laura yeah  travis didnt really look like much  liam yeah either that or im really bullshitting you and nothing happened  laura either way i liked it lets sneak out  taliesin im going to do one last thing before we leave which is just tussle the room a bit so it  looks like its been robbed just in case they do come in  matt okay so you toss /tavern/ the room a bit muddle up the space and you guys one by one climb out the  back of the window down the rope and into the alley behind the inn looking about youre  waiting until about postmidnight you said  travis yeah  matt okay so its dark the various lanterns that dangle on the hook poles at different  intersections of the street are lit other than that you have a faint bit of moonlight thats  coming through the sky there are some clouds but theyre a bit broken up so every now and then /none/ the  moon cover can vanish and then return but for now you have moonlight in the city where are you guys  going  laura towards the north end  travis i ought to be leading the way i reckon  sam yeah ill go to where i saw the three cloaked figures  matt a little ways north of natural remedies okay i would like everybody to make a stealth  check please  sam stealth check do i still have the blessing no i dont  laura no you dont but i can do it to everybody /none/ one by one if we get to an open area  sam 21  travis 15  marisha 19  taliesin 17  laura 21  liam forty 12  sam 42  matt you guys following nott dodge between alleys there are a few patrols of the crownsguard  that you see passing by and you wait for them to just cross paths and then move on eventually  finding your way to natural remedies seemingly unseen its quiet you can hear the sound of  crickets in the distance the cold night air is causing your breath to /none/ show every time you exhale  you all bundle your cloaks as you move on the moonlight fades a bit things get darker but you  follow notts lead travel from place to place you finally get to the outskirts of natural  remedies and to the northern alleyway where youd originally seen those figures pass youre there  sam should we fan out a bit cover a couple corners so we can still see each other  travis good idea  laura yeah im going to go with fjord  marisha lets not spread out too far though  /none/ sam are you two like an item  laura what  sam you and fjord are you like a thing  laura why are you interested in him  sam no ugh no  laura no  sam you travel together  laura well yeah hes a good friend he watches out for me i watch out for him you know were a  good team like you and caleb  sam not at all like that but yes all right  matt as you guys fan out a little bit everyone make a perception check  laura natural one /none/  sam 19  laura i dont see shit  marisha perception  taliesin 12  travis nine  marisha 18  liam ten  matt okay so all of you except for jester manage to get a clear view of your vicinity  jester you somehow get an eyelash caught in your eye and spend the next hour trying to get it out  but its in the eyelid  laura fjord can you see it  travis look up yeah  marisha to the left  travis let me get it  laura no no no okay okay /none/ okay  matt occasionally you can hear the crownsguard approaching and they carry their torches with  them you can see the light crawling forward so you all duck out of the way and let them pass  about an hour passes two hours pass around the third hour you get the sensation that whatever  you saw the other night is not arriving on a clockwork time or not arriving at all its about  three in the morning in the center of the city by yourself what do you wish to do  marisha three in the morning /none/  matt yeah  marisha i turn to caleb any tingling from your alarm system  liam no i wouldnt have brought it up if something had happened  marisha thats a good point  taliesin im just going to try to meditate on the strange death and see if i can feel anything  matt okay  make an intelligence check  taliesin all right just see how this goes  sam mediation check  taliesin 17  matt pouring over the details of what has transpired and what you guys have done so far to  find information /none/ there are still things to inquire about there are still things to wonder  and discover and there are a few places you havent been to a few places you havent returned  to a few people you havent even inquired about closer to the investigation  laura oh we should talk to the girl  sam toya  laura yeah  sam lets go wake her ass up  marisha is she under arrest we dont know  taliesin maybe we have to go back to the circus  laura maybe it was yasha  taliesin its early enough /none/ maybe we should just  travis we have a few more hours and the cover of darkness  sam yeah lets go wake her ass up  marisha maybe we should go back to the circus scene of the crime that whole thing  taliesin i hate to admit it but maybe its not us  travis whos real stealthy  marisha im all right  travis maybe we dont all need to go maybe just a few and the others will hang back  sam hang back close by though right if something goes bad  marisha or if /tavern/ you see something how far are we from the inn  matt from the inn about a 15 minute jog  sam so we can go to the circus  travis an hour and a half  laura while were still trying to figure this out im going to take out my painters kit and  draw like a little piece of poop on the side of the building that were next to  sam tagging thats good  marisha a little tagger  travis is it like a mound of poop or like a single  laura no its /none/ like a mound of poop  taliesin its like an emoji  matt make a performance check  laura oh i rolled really low on this one four  matt it takes a little convincing to have them see the poop in the drawing you can see it but  youve seen better  travis is it a worm its a snake  laura its poop i shouldve  liam thats an oval  laura i should have drawn a pile of poop i draw a pile of poop next to it  matt it helps but  liam thats /dung/ a triangle  travis yeah i thought it was like chocolate frozen yogurt  taliesin is math or something  laura its dark okay i can usually paint much better than this its really dark and my hands  feel a little numb  sam lets move then  matt whos going where what are you guys doing  all were all going to the circus  travis stealthily to the circus  matt all right i would like for all of you to roll a stealth check  marisha is no one staying behind or  laura fuck it /town/  sam some are staying away from the tent  travis yeah going in danger close  sam 13  travis nine  marisha oh not great nine  taliesin seven  laura 19  liam 15  sam 13  matt okay you guys make your way through most of the docksward on your way to the large blue tent  that still stands ominously in the distance thankfully the moon has come out and cast this  rimlight against the structure so its easy to see as you guys are making your way outside of  the lochward /town/ you immediately see the approaching torchlight of crownsguard one of them you just  faintly hear 40 or 50 feet ahead of you who goes there  laura oh shit  sam is there only one guard  matt its two guards side by side these watches they patrol in pairs  marisha are we in like an alleyway or in the street  matt you guys are keeping off to the side youre all on the outskirts of the lake and almost made  your way out of the city towards where the  laura go in the lake /none/ quick go into the lake  travis i cast disguise self and i turn myself into a crownsguard  liam disguise self and follow suit  matt you do as well  liam yeah  matt all right so you both become crownsguard youve all of a sudden are adorned in the goldish  brass and red armor  taliesin im in my black hood ive got my hood up now  sam anywhere to hide  matt there are some small alcoves but you guys are out in the open now theyve seen you  marisha all of us /none/  matt you dont know theyve seen you theyve called to you and then both of you guys  disguised yourselves what are you doing  laura i walk into the lake and crouch down  matt jester walks up and wades in about six inches of water and just gives her best duck  impression  sam i will take off my mask and start attacking caleb in a convincing fashion not to draw blood  but yeah  matt make a deception check  sam deception check  matt yes  sam oh  liam can i start /none/ going groans oh get off you little beast to help with the illusion  sam snarling noises  matt sure make a deception check  sam oh my deception check was a three minus three  liam but roll with advantage  sam at advantage  liam im helping you you little  sam seven minus three  liam oh no  matt okay so as soon as these two crownsguard see this they go shit they pull their blades and  they start charging you nott to try and protect their other crownsguard  liam i take nott and /none/ slam her into a wall as hard as i can and say down you beast  matt all right as you rush up in a jog blades drawn one of them is going to go ahead and  attempt to strike  sam oh god sure  matt that is going to be a 14 to hit  sam miss  matt so you manage to squeaks and narrowly dodge the blade as it strikes through the back of  your cloak and pins it to the side of a wooden pole that is on the outside of an overhang /none/ where  some of the fish are being left out to dry and turn into fish jerky it holds you in place as  youre snarling and looking scared the other one pulls out his blade and says where did this thing  come from  liam i have it and i punch nott right in the face  sam oh  matt all right you take one point of bludgeoning damage nott and blood just flowing noise from  the nose  liam i have this were taking these people across to jail  travis regal voice indeed stay /dung/ our blade please obviously he can handle this  liam dont you fucking move you little green piece of filth  sam spits  travis right in your face haha incredible  liam this one is mine thank you beat her within an inch of her life  matt i need you to make a deception check on that one  taliesin we are just the worst this is just terrible  marisha oh man  liam natural 20  cheering  sam weve practiced this before we got this routine down  matt you see a look of disappointment /none/ come across the two crownsguards faces in their inability to  help you skewer this small feral creature they both put their blades away all right if you see  anything else give a shout spits  sam ugh  matt they both continue their walk past the rest of you  liam the rest of you lot fall in line i drag the little one off  sam snivels  matt they look over at the tiefling partially crouched in the water  sam shes taking a shit  laura i really had to pee  matt hey not /none/ in the ustaloch  laughter  laura okay oh okay i get out i stand up and slowly dredge out of the water  matt your legs are soaked from thigh to foot and they both eye you warily and slowly walk past  laura sigh of relief  marisha its real cold out  liam have they cleared the way  matt eventually they pass beyond a point where you feel absolute dread of their presence  travis is that a natural thing for you guys to just attack each other in moments of stress  liam are you /none/ all right i am so very sorry im so sorry  sam no im fine that was good acting you were perfect i panicked i didnt know what to do i  was trying to create some sort of distraction  liam let me see your teeth okay you look all right  sam theyre all over the place  laughter  travis oh i cant tell if that got worse or better  marisha you fixed them a bit  liam okay who wants to go to the circus  marisha yay  matt all right you guys are /none/ make the rest of the path to the outskirts of the circus you see at  the very front flap of it you see a crownsguard whos like yawn sitting there his arms crossed  to the front keeping an eye out he is doing lateshift you do see the faint distant  flickering glow of firelight from the back side of the circus  marisha what is that do you guys have like a nightlight  taliesin its where we camp  matt yeah you saw it earlier you saw the campfire  marisha oh sure  travis if /none/ you want to make your ways around i could distract them for a moment have a  conversation with them  marisha do they still look like crownsguard  matt yes  travis for an hour  marisha okay yeah  liam you you want to go with them ill go with him  sam sure but will you be watching me or no you dont have to  liam frumpkin will go with you  sam all right ill go with you and who else is going are you stealthy  laura well take care of you dont worry /none/  taliesin theyre

 travis yeah have you heard heard  how long are they supposed to be here  matt until they finish this /town/ fucking investigation they keep bugging people for  information but theyre all just clammed up and not saying shit  travis at least youre by the tent theyve had us walking the perimeter of the lake the entire  time  matt its bullshit i wish they would just go ahead and execute them that carnival master or  whatever and get it over with  travis did they find anything inside today tell me something interesting please  matt they investigated the corpses and found nothing yet still in there if you want to take a  look at /none/ it  travis would you mind if we popped in  matt i mean i suppose so make a deception check  marisha something good something good  taliesin no  travis where is it jesus  oh 13  matt okay he thinks a second on it oh i suppose so go on in  travis well be quick super fast  matt please get it over with he stops you if theres any way to expedite this if you can  pin it on any of them we can just kill them and take care of it let /town/ me know  travis lets go  as grog that worked way better than i thought like we should i mean  as fjord should we look around for stuff or what  laughter  sam yes yes  liam you are very good with voices  travis well you know i do a little mimicry here and there we should look come on check the  grounds maybe we can find where the bodies are laying  liam yeah lets have a look around  matt you guys look inside the tent is dark theres no light inside  /none/ liam i take a rag out of my side satchel and i cast what the hell is it called because ive  only been a wizard for a short time one dancing light underneath the rags so its only dim  matt all right so you have this selfmade hooded lantern with the hood you have over it  liam yeah  matt okay  marisha thats dope  liam what the fuck are we looking for in here  matt and nott youre going with them  sam im with the girls  travs where did the bodies fall /none/ over there didnt they  liam thats right yeah  travis well lets search the grounds  matt you make your way inside the smell is pretty bad you can smell the flesh beginning to  decay  travis have they moved the bodies or are the bodies still there  matt with a bit of looking the bodies are still there where they left them they have not moved  you can see a couple of remnants of notes and sheets that have been crumpled but the bodies  have been left where they are  travis can we /none/ check the bodies for anything  liam is there anything arcane from all my studies does anything here ring any bell i have  a photographic memory  matt go and make a religion check  liam all right that is a ten  matt unfortunately you dont have a lot of research on the undead or whatever might be the  essence of this creatures creation and the more you look at it youre like this is not my  specialty  liam okay what about the perimeters of here where all the people were there was a swarm /none/ of  people i spend five minutes seeing anything was dropped of interest  matt make an investigation check both of you  travis thats better  liam i miss the twins  travis 16  liam big ten  matt glancing about you can see the track marks of everyone fleeing you can see the spatters of  blood you can see the place where the transformation occurred there is a horrible  shedding of certain layers of flesh you can see previously existing layers of flesh and muscle  that were shed as whatever this undead thing was /none/ fell to the ground once again you make a  religion check as well  travis okay roll high i did not ten  matt yeah this is not your specialty you have little experience with the undead and this type of  magic  travis we cant spend that long in here maybe we just take a bit of it with us do you have a  pocket  liam i have many pockets of course i have pockets  travis like a jar ii got no pockets  sam you designed a character with no pockets why would /none/ you do that  travis theres no pockets all right but ill check  liam hes just in the blue man group unitard and thats it  marisha im sure rob liefeld just got a nosebleed and he doesnt know why  liam so this dead thing is here in front of me  matt two of them theres the main one the ground zero one which is where you were putting  all your attention and then theres the woman who was transformed as part of the first  liam i will take my dagger and i will slice /dung/ a little bit off of the woman and its going to get  dark in here and i will snuff out the light and use the rag to roll it up and ill put the little  piece in my pack  matt with a squishy sound you place it within your pack  liam lets get out of here im going to be sick  travis agreed  matt all right the four of you i need you to roll stealth checks please  marisha not that one i dont feel good about it oh not bad 21  /town/ taliesin 17  laura 18  sam 25  matt without issue you guys quickly dart around the side of the tent and make your way right  towards the central area where the multitude of tents to this back encampment is placed there is  a single campfire the embers are burning out it has not been kept up you do see two crownsguard  who are currently keeping watch one of them is slumped in a chair across from the fire and is  nodding off the other is doing a basic patrol and looking around other than /town/ that you dont hear  any sounds you dont see anybody else just the two crownsguard  taliesin which of the tents is currently occupied  matt there are four main tents there are two very large ones one of which generally contains  toya and kylre the devil toad thats on the south side theres the north largest tent this  one contains the knot sisters and ornna then theres a very small tent to the south side that  would be bo the breakers tent but hes not here then theres a medium sized tent on the north /town/  side who would be in that one  taliesin toya and kylre share a tent thats right it would be desmond  matt desmond would be the other one it would be gustav staying there as well but gustav changes  between the tent and the cart  marisha the cart  taliesin we have a wagon  laura molly i have a question what made you guys set up your tent here  taliesin we were told to set it up here if i recall  laura in this specific area  taliesin that sounds right if i /town/ recall we were specifically told to set up tent right here  marisha and its by the lake right  matt maybe 150200 feet away from it  marisha thats pretty close to a lake  laura what if they set up their tent on a cursed land or something  marisha its the lake its common  taliesin whats the easiest tent to get to without  matt do you want to go to the north side or the south side of the main tent  taliesin i want to go with whatevers furthest away from the guards  /town/ sam shouldnt we just go to the toya tent  matt the toya tents on the south side thats the opposite side you guys would have probably  come in from the north end  taliesin whats the easiest to get to without  matt that would be the one that contains ornna and the knot sisters  taliesin im going to go back there and do our traditional bird call  matt okay theres actually no response  laura bird call  marisha i had mona and lena but maybe its lolie  taliesin yuli its mona and yuli /town/ im going to try one of the other tents am i getting the sense  that any of them are in  sam look over here  taliesin over here  matt the other tent you get to and you make the same sound this would be the one that desmond  usually is in too theres a pause and then you hear a very faint bird call  taliesin im going to very gently lift the back of the tent up and not go in through the front  and just  matt okay you glance inside and you /none/ can see leaning up from a bedroll desmond who is  halfawake and glances over and sees you hes out of outfit out of makeup and he gives a nod  taliesin whispering do you know whats going on switches to normal volume assume were  whispering because this is bullshit  matt yeah  taliesin how is it whats happened  matt theyve come around asking a few questions were trying to figure it out ourselves are you  okay  taliesin i could be worse  matt hows gustav and bosun  taliesin they couldnt be worse and /town/ then yasha yashad i dont know did toya see anything did  she say anything  matt were still trying to figure this out ourselves are you alone  taliesin no ive picked up a few scragglers theyre idiots but theyre helping  matt well bring them in  sam we come in  matt you guys all enter the tent and you see desmond previously you saw him in this very  colorful outfit with the frilled neck piece and the full facial makeup now you see a man in his  late 30s with a very scarred left /town/ side of his face it looks like it was shredded at one point  in his youth that the makeup hid during the performance as soon as you enter even upon  greeting him he has a very sad presence to him even though youre all under the cover of night  and having this conspiratorial conversation he has this melancholy about him that permeates the  space inside the tent he says so youre all the ones that helped earlier thank you it would have  been far worse if you hadnt  laura no problem  taliesin what /none/ do they think happened what are they asking  matt theyre thinking something about the show theyre thinking gustav made this happen i dont  think its gustav hes a good man he makes poor choices and its plagued him his whole life you  can see it in his brow but good intentions have grave consequences no one that good comes out of  shady creek run without some mistakes behind them but i dont see him doing this  taliesin what would be the point  laura has it ever happened like this before  matt no  /none/ laura anything weird ever happened before  matt weird things all the time were a bunch of weird folk work with a lot of weird people  bunch of strange freaks gathered to this show  marisha was there anyone new here recently that you havent worked with a lot  matt yeah she apparently ran off  taliesin yashas the newest but she can be flighty  marisha what about mona and yuli  matt the sisters are bitter but its no fault of theirs  marisha why are they bitter  matt because the world is cruel  /tavern/ taliesin youve never met it well nevermind  matt i wish i could help them but it  marisha stutters what happened to them  laura are you drunk whats going on  marisha no im trying to hear and whisper at the same time  laura you can talk at a normal volume  matt magical whisper cone of whisper  marisha matt cone of whisper  taliesin oh god thats a new thing now  marisha what did they say why do they think that why is the world shitty  matt have you been around have you /town/ travelled to see anything  marisha yeah listen the world has its own brand of shitty depending on whose eyes are looking at  it right so what is their brand of shitty  taliesin circus shitty  matt i dont know ask them  marisha where are they  taliesin in a tent over there  matt they dont seem to take much of a liking to me anyway so i cant really tell you myself im  sorry  sam they dont like you why  matt theres a lot of people that dont like me  laura /none/ i like you desmond i think youre great  sam why what did you do  matt he looks at you and goes same reason folks probably dont like you youre different  sam hmm  taliesin is everybody still here theyve not taken anyone away other than  matt other than those two everyone else is here were just keeping under watch until their  investigation is complete  marisha molly why did you laugh when i asked about the sisters  taliesin were carnival people weve all got our issues you dont end up here if youre not /none/  a little weird  laura can i try something i want to try to cast detect good and evil  matt okay  liam cleric shit  laura right  sam on  laura on the area it lasts up to ten minutes so its within 30 feet of me  travis you ever cast this before  laura no  travis taliesin and marisha first cast  travis and taliesin first blood  matt so you cast it you concentrate you reach down and grasp the bottom of your symbol that  hangs around your belt and theres /town/ a faint rush of divine force given to your consciousness you  dont sense within 30 feet of you any fiendish or celestial or fey or undead or aberration  laura nothing thats been desecrated  matt nothing from this tent or within 30 feet  sam does it follow her  laura yeah it follows me  matt its like a radial thing  sam thats pretty cool lets keep going then maybe well see something  laura yeah am i close to the edge of the main tent  matt there are two tents to the north theres /town/ a bigger one and a medium one the one that youre  in right now is the larger one to the north and as such contains actually no the one that you  guys are in right now is the medium one the one that contains desmond the larger one contains  both of the sisters and ornna  laura okay and theyre closer to the big tent where is the big tent  matt correct the big tent is about ten to 15 feet from the one youre in right now  laura okay cool yeah lets leave ill /town/ get up to the edge of the big tent and i want to see if  i can feel anything weird in that area  matt okay is everyone else staying inside or are you going with her  sam were going with but before we leave ill ask desmond from one outcast to another are  there any questions that are bugging you about all this  matt he thinks for a second i dont want this all to fall on gustav hes done a lot of good for  all of us and the way theyre talking about /town/ the investigation theyre looking to make a scapegoat  of this  sam well thank you  matt thank you  sam mimics bird call poorly thats how they talk to each other thats how carnival folk talk  to each other  taliesin oh for fucks sake im going to do my best  matt thank you  taliesin im going to quietly sneak out the back of the tent again and sneak into the  matt another stealth check my friends  taliesin oh god i hate all of this  laura im going to give molly blessing /town/ so you get advantage  sam 21  marisha 13 not great  taliesin 13  matt with advantage  taliesin with advantage  laura 12  matt okay you guys make your way up to the edge of the tent  taliesin im not going to make the noise im just going to  matt right as you make your way over to the edge of the tent where the sisters and ornna are you  focus and concentrate nothing from the radial thing one of the guards whos standing up and  making a patrol looks over right /town/ as you duck behind and you hear a huh  sam uh oh  laura quick go in the tent  taliesin were going to go in the tent  laura we all duck under the tent go and act like were sleeping  matt you guys all dodge under the tent just as the guard begins to pass around you hear the  footsteps around as you step in you watch as the two knot sisters  taliesin shushes  matt they both curl into a ball and stay really quiet all of the sudden ornna comes to  /none/ consciousness and light footsteps  the footsteps finish the circle and then go back towards where the fire is  laura that was close  matt ornna leans in goes like okay what is going on  taliesin thats what im trying to figure out what the fuck is going on theyre with me its  been complicated gustavs in deep bosuns in deep  laura tell us you know something  matt what do you want to know  taliesin what did you see i dont know  sam who did this what was it  matt i dont /none/ know i looked and i saw what you saw  taliesin this is ornna i assume  matt this is ornna yeah  taliesin ornna is the fire dancer  marisha right okay  taliesin for fucks sake theyre going to kill every last fucking one of us unless  we figure this out  matt shes like right  taliesin what do you think  matt well the sisters over here think its a hit job but this isnt a hit job with zombies  are you fucking kidding me  taliesin i dont know i think that theyre /town/ trying to cover something  matt thats not surprising  marisha can i insight check the sisters what are they doing right now  matt theyre both just quietly curled up and watching you guys talk  marisha theyre not saying anything though  matt not yet if you want to ask them something you can  marisha do they look nervous or are they just being shifty  matt make an insight check to find out  marisha yeah  laura while shes doing that im going to try and sneak out the underside of the tent to go /town/ to the  big tent  sam ill go with her  matt this is a bit of a leap this goes about 25 30 feet south of where you are around the campfire  thats open  sam no problem  matt go ahead and make your stealth checks guys  taliesin oh god i miss pass without a trace so much  sam 23  taliesin thats a number  laura nine  matt okay what was your insight check  marisha 15  matt 15 they both look nervous but just untrusting of the scenario you cant /none/ read  anything deeper than that there is definitely a hmm but you cant quite get a full bead on them  you guys as you curl around the outside theres the one guard thats sitting in the chair by the  fire that goes like snores and opens his eyes a little bit and looks over in your direction  jester and theres a brief moment where hes just looking right at you do you do anything  laura i freeze  sam oh god  matt stands up  laura can i use oh shit im going shitballs /none/ shit  sam im just tucking around getting ready  matt youre around you dont see anything  sam i dont see this  matt sorry he doesnt see you  laura im going to cast charm person on the guard that sees me  matt okay as he stands up he goes toward you and he goes for his blade and he has to make a  saving throw  sam oh boy  matt which he does not make i dont think so its like a six  sam no its like 13 or something  laura yeah /none/  matt so he goes like  laura hi im not here  matt okay  laura okay sit down go to sleep this is a dream  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin thats so good  laura thats so close this is so bad five  matt he doesnt seem to buy the dream thing but hes like  laura you want it to be a dream  matt he doesnt go to sleep but he knows youre there and hes keeping an eye but  hes not doing anything  laura okay well its good enough /town/ i guess  matt but hes definitely aware that youre there  laura im going to go towards the big tent just so i can see if i can sense any evil  matt okay really quickly just to check because its thats right charm person is not  laura its not yes  matt okay its at this point that you turn your attention to the tent and focus there is a hefty  radiating warm fiendish source from the inside of that large tent  sam we found something  laura i can sense something lets go in /town/ the tent  sam go in but if its bad thats bad  laura what if its just a dead thing  sam oh god will we have to fight a dead thing should we get some help i turn to calebs cat and  i say go go get caleb shoo hiss go away hiss i cant speak cat go away  matt the cat goes angry meow  sam go away go tell caleb were here  matt hiss  liam yes  matt turns around and sprays you and then keep walking  sam okay ive sent /town/ for help  laura okay lets go under the tent  sam all right lets go  matt you guys carefully maneuver under the tent as soon as you curl into the interior of the tent  you hear a very heavy snoring  laura this the big tent that you guys were just in  sam no  matt no its the one on the south side of it  sam its a different one  laura oh  marisha toad guy  matt you see the slowly expanding and contracting form of kylre from the back side you /town/ see this  giant scaly somewhat oily exterior of the body  sam thats why you detected him because hes a fiend  laura maybe hes a good fiend can fiends be good  sam i dont know you detected  laura is he still sleeping  matt snoring  laura hes still sleeping  sam we can wake him up and ask  laura and ask if hes good or bad  sam yeah  laura and sam eh  sam is anyone else in the tent  matt make a perception check  sam one  laura oh /none/ no we suck at this  liam this everything  laura 17  matt okay thats better you just stare right at the body of this toad going nope  sam this looks really big and scary  matt you glance and see a faint bit of a whitish material from the crook of the arm you take a few  steps forward and glance from the side and you can see asleep cradled in his large lizardman arms  toya dwarf girl is curled up and asleep peacefully  sam we should talk to her but if we wake /none/ her up hes going to be mad i guess we have no choice  we should talk to her shes a dwarf do you speak dwarvish  laura no i dont  sam maybe she speaks common well be fine shes a circus person  liam i have that ability it lets you know exactly where the fiend is which of those  things is the fiend  laura which of the things is the fiend  matt its the large source  laura its definitely the large fiend  liam it could have easily been the little girl  /town/ matt it could have been yeah  laura its the big guy  sam lets wake her up  matt the radiance is around the large creature  laura and her name is toya  sam toya singing dwarf  laura lets sit down on the ground and look nonthreatening so we sit down crosslegged just  casual like were having a tea party  sam put down my hair  laura and then we go toya toya wake up  sam wakey wakey  matt the breathing stops and theres this stillness in the interior of the tent  /dung/ sam we should light a light or something otherwise were just in the dark  matt you hear this faint sound of squeaking as lubricated folds of lizardman flesh twist over  each other as the devil toads head kind of curls back to look at you quietly the mouth slightly  ajar you can see rows of teeth and this bit of drool down the edge of the chin onto the ground  what you want  laura were here to talk to toya  matt at which point the little girl yawn begins grunt thumping and rotates in /town/ his space he  takes up almost the entirety of this tent and slowly rotates around inside surprisingly quiet  for his size and still clutching toya toya sits up and is like whats happening yawn  laura hi  matt hi  sam sorry to disturb your slumber  matt she takes her braids and holds them with her hands its almost a safety blanket she curls into  herself she looks about 11 or 12 this close you can see she looks younger than she did from that  distance whether it be the presence or the mature /none/ voice but she seems pretty young but shes not  childlike  laura oh hey whats going on  matt  well  sam do you recognize us from the other night last night  laura last night  sam last night  matt i dont remember i got scared  laura it was scary you have a really pretty voice  matt thank you  laura did you notice how when you sang that a dude turned into a zombie  matt she begins to chuckle and the big toad laughter i did it was really scary i didnt /none/  like it at all i didnt do that did i  laura probably not  sam has it happened before or was that  matt no the guards are saying i probably did that theyre saying i might have done that its  interesting you notice now listening to her she has this beautiful voice but her speaking voice is  very crackly it sounds almost damaged  laura do you sing all the time toya  matt i sing a lot its what keeps me alive its what gets me money  laura right i understand that  /none/ sam was that the same song you always sing  matt yeah its the one song i know  sam did it feel the same coming out of you or was it different  matt it felt the same  laura what language is it  matt its an old dwarven tune my mother taught it to me before she passed  laura what does it mean  matt its a tale of the angels and how they came from the realms beyond of the gods they granted  each to us our sparks of life  laura granted sparks /none/ of life does that sound like a familiar story that ive heard before  matt it sounds vaguely religious but  sam when you were singing did you hear any other sounds or words that someone else was saying  matt no not beyond the ordinary then i saw that poor man just start tearing through people i  got scared and kylre helped me she puts her arm up and pats and grunt  laura how did you and kylre meet  matt they brought me into the circus i was up in a city north of here far /none/ north of the marrow  valley and i was just on the streets singing and this carnival came by and i met gustav and he  invited me to join and thats how i met kylre and i met all these wonderful people  sam has anyone new come around and talked to you  matt no  sam asked you to do anything its so strange  laura man we suck at this  sam no were really good  matt the newest people weve had are mollymauk and yasha  laura theyre new  matt comparatively mollymauks been /none/ here almost two years now  laura oh okay  matt he came after i did we both found our voice together i was very scared and he wasnt  talking and together we helped each other learn to have fun again  sam and yesterday before the show you didnt notice anything weird anyone creeping around the  carnival setting up anything  matt no  sam snooping around  laura anybody in weird cloaks  sam cloaks cloaks  matt i didnt see anything  laura okay  liam dm on a minor note i put my hand /town/ on fjords shoulder and say im going to be blind for  a second give me a little slap if anything goes wrong and i tune into frumpkin who should still be  matt at this point in time you notice laughter nott going shoo cah go find help and you hear  a hiss grumpy meow yeah  liam and then frumpkin takes off  matt frumpkin starts heading back around towards you  liam so im looking at myself after a moment  matt briefly as you keep concentrating frumpkin finds his way under the tent and comes /none/ up to you  sam is there anyone you think would want to destroy the carnival or hurt gustav does gustav  have any enemies  matt i hope not i know him and ornna argue a lot but  sam him and ornna its ornna ornnas the one thanks very much were out of here  laughter  sam hot lead  laura lets go weve got it weve solved the case  taliesin im going to have a tiny bit of conversation with her  matt yeah so while theyre gone the two of you are in the /town/ other tent with the sisters and ornna  marisha i would like to talk with the sisters while that is going on  matt theyre both sitting there knees tucked to their chest  marisha i go and sit down next to them putting my knees up too this whole thing is really  messed up right  matt yeah youre telling us  marisha yeah man like why would we do anything like that i feel like were all being needlessly  persecuted  matt im sorry who are you  marisha oh sorry im beau the other bo /none/ but i helped fight the zombies the other night im  under house arrest were under the same situation just separately not really i dont  want to compare myself to you because that would be rude  matt the two halfling twins look at each other and back at you  taliesin her names beau shes helping shes awful you have a lot in common  matt okay well i mean whatever you want to know  marisha hes such a dick why is he such a dick  matt mollys great why are you such a dick  /town/ travis reversal  marisha oh sorry hes been talking

i thought we were stealthing over to the main tent  sam the one with ornna in it  taliesin ornnas in the tent with us  matt oh you guys are going to the main tent  laura i wanted to get to the main tent to see if i could sense any evil in the big main tent  sam oh you want to swoop by the main tent  laura but if its /town/ really far away  matt not too far away from where you were because youre backing out the side of it so you  can go ahead and stealth around make a stealth check  laura oh god please no one please no whammies  taliesin and laura big money  sam im fine  laura natural 20  matt nice and what did you get  sam 22  matt the two of you without issue make your way around towards the large tent without being seen  sam any evil  laura im sensing it  matt nothing /none/  sam goddamn it  laura no fucking evil  sam its ornna we know who it is we know who the killer is  taliesin while youre talking to the twins ill be talking to ornna oh for fucks sake  matt to be honest if its any easier its probably gustav  taliesin its not fucking gustav  matt it probably is you shut up hes a prick he doesnt know what hes doing hes going to run  this whole carnival into the ground i dont want to take the fall for it we all get away /none/ on this  marisha no  travis little feet  liam snarling noises  travis eats and shoots the same way snarls  marisha so wait its probably gustav what makes you say that  matt because hes in prison hes the leader hes fucked this whole thing by letting this  happen  marisha oh wow you have interesting perspectives hey weird question how do you guys  come up with your acts is that something that you guys create yourselves or do you guys workshop it  taliesin its like shes never experienced boredom its very weird  /none/ matt yeah its impressive  taliesin hey ornna  matt ornna goes yes  taliesin sighs i mean i know your feelings on all this what do you think  matt sighs id say bosuns a stand up guy if a bit of a selfabsorbed dick at times and we all  knew gustav was going to shit the bed sooner or later i mean this is his karma i just dont  know how or why but i can guarantee you if this was my carnival this shit wouldnt have happened  taliesin really  matt mmhmm  taliesin /none/ what exactly would you have done  matt well first off i would have made sure that we had better support from the guard before  this all happened so nobody else got killed  taliesin they were useless  matt secondly i would have made sure that there werent any old folks that made it in to fucking  turn into shit  taliesin well thats on me and thats on me  matt i dont know  marisha you feel the same way knot sisters feel like this is karma on gustav  taliesin they would  matt /town/ at which point the flap of the tent opens up and its jester  laura its ornna  sam ornna you have a lot of explaining to do  marisha shut up  sam you have a lot of explaining to do  marisha shut up  sam weve talked to toya she knows its you who did this  laura we know you guys are in a fight all the time  sam youre the one behind the whole plot you did it  laura you  matt the two knot sisters immediately go ornna is it you did /none/ you kill that guy ornnas like  i dont know what youre talking about what the fuck is this who the fuck are you  laura why did you turn that guy into a zombie  sam who do you work for  taliesin ornna ornna  marisha

hit points  travis it opens it closes you can see your spells when you need to see them without  flipping  taliesin ive got a little ipad button on the back of my pen its quite nice  sam start talking or this gnome nope goblin starts biting  matt ornna goes to be perfectly honest i have no idea whats going on yall just /none/ came in here  started throwing accusations at me gustav got arrested bosun got arrested molly got  arrested im glad you got off that but to be perfectly honest this whole things a shit show  and the circus is probably not going to be the same after this  laura insight check on the  matt insight check on ornna  liam my cat is on patrol because weve been standing with our dicks in our hands for a long  time  matt yeah im sorry  liam no im not complaining but i would have sent /none/ the cat out  laura seven  matt kind of hard to read she seems genuinely frustrated and caught off guard by this  laura i think shes telling the truth  taliesin ornna you might as well come clean this is classic you  matt she looks at you molly  taliesin im just trying to  matt fuck you  taliesin oh fuck you too its no secret that ornna and gustav have their differences but this  ridiculous i mean she knows damn well that half the circus would leave if he got fucking arrested  and /dung/ died  matt youre for real worried about this you really think who it could be lets play gustav  hes an idiot but hes not a murderer bosun bit of a dick but hes a stand up fella toya  absolute doll couldnt hurt a fly mona and yuli theyre cunts but theyre not going to kill  anyone desmonds a weird fellow theres something dark in his past you can see it in his  melancholy  taliesin but this is not his style  sam its desmond lets go to his tent  taliesin i just grab /none/  matt theres some untrustworthy intelligence in those lizard eyes of that devil  laura i did get a very evil kind of vibe off him  taliesin what do you mean evil kind of vibe  laura well i mean hes a fiend  taliesin hes what  laura the devil toad guy hes a fiend  taliesin thats just a name its not actually like real thing that just  stammering  laura you guys know hes a fiend right  matt theres this moment of silence like hes supposed to be lizardfolk  taliesin what do you /town/  sam its the lizard man  taliesin i grab and push you down into the ground and hold you shushing sounds not yet  sam were cracking this case wide open  matt you guys what are you doing  liam i mean just because were standing here so long i would have been nervous and again held on  to this guys big bicep and sent the cat out  travis why are you going all catatonic on me  matt laughs nice as the cat darts under the tent and makes its way through you glance over /dung/ to  the fire and sees a large dark shape step out from one of the tents and you watch as one of the  guards whos sitting in the chair stands up and crumples onto the ground without a sound you see  the other guard look over go over and run up to him and start to check on him you guys hear a voice  in the back start saying damon damon  marisha just a guard one of the guards  liam fjord something bad is happening  matt you watch as the dark figure spins /none/ and two flashes of red in the shadow nearby and you watch  as the other guard suddenly grabs his head and grasps at his chest and falls on his back as his  legs curl up  marisha what the fuck  liam do i know where in relation to fjord and i this is  matt it is to the east of you about 150 feet  travis can you talk to me when youre looking through the cat  liam i can talk but i cant hear anything when im doing this  matt correct you watch /town/ as the shadow bounds like a giant frog  liam the frog is on the move frog is on the move  matt northward  liam away from us but i dont know where the others are  matt you guys hear the name calling and then silence once more  laura whispers can we peek outside of the tent and see whats going on  matt you guys go ahead and you look just as the guard on the ground is like gurgling and just  stops moving you see all the veins bulging  marisha i run up /town/ to the guard and check his pulse is he still alive or is he paralyzed  matt as you come out of the tent you watch as the flesh on his neck and throat splits and a very  familiar transformation begins to take place as both of the guards begin to growling  laura oh no we have to fight them  marisha yeah but get under the tent we can get the drop  liam i come out of it and i zombies i start running towards the tent that i saw jester peek  out from under /town/  matt as you guys rush underneath the big blue tent you watch as the two guards that are quickly  bulging and mutating bits of their flesh dislodging from their body and falling you watch  now up close similar to the last time but now that you are looking intently for this you can  see where there should be blood its almost like dust and sand begin to spill from the wounds  something you had noticed a little bit in the body of the old man before but you didnt know if it  was decomposition /town/ or just general dirt  taliesin girls were not supposed to be here can you help us handle this  matt you watch as the two halflings are like fuck no  taliesin sighs well do what we can if something goes wrong nudity usually works  laughing  matt the two mutated guards now their armor bulging and broken in places turn to the noises  in the tent where you guys are  sam are we in the same tent or are we in two different tents  matt you guys are all in one tent with the /town/ other girls you are all jammed into the space the two  of you make your way outside of the large tent as you watch these two bulging zombified creatures  making their way towards the tent and thats where were going to pick up next time  groaning  sam bastard  matt because it is 11 now  travis but were not supposed to be there were gonna get framed for it  marisha exactly we cant get framed  sam can i just say laura and i busted the case wide open  laughter  travis that /none/ is true  sam we solved the case easy  laura totally  taliesin which ones nancy which ones drew  sam couple inquisitions couple little uh  following the clues  laura thats right  taliesin just one more question  travis when that demon frog leapt how high and how far approximately did it look like it went  matt it looks like it leapt about 20 to 25 feet in the air and traveled about 40 feet with the  leap it was a large arc  laura so we definitely cant fight that thing  travis /none/ sure we can  laura oh my god  travis oh god  matt you saw it escape northward from where you are  marisha and did it look like the same figure  matt yasha ran north northeast this is just straight north of where you are  towards the ustaloch  marisha towards ustaloch its the fucking lake  crosstalk  travis oh man this is good dude  marisha see heres my thing does anyone else notice that the zombie transformations seem like a  serpent shedding its skin because they always slough off their skin  /dung/ travis its also done without any contact  marisha wait what  travis its done without any contact he never touches him  laura yeah he touched him didnt he  matt no  laura i thought he did  matt no they just suddenly began to erupt in  laura hey bonus news though the charm spell guy isnt going to turn me dead  matt look at that silver lining  taliesin this season got dark season got dark  laura whoa tight tight tight tight  travis good shit little damaged voice fuck yeah  matt thatll /none/ be fun  laura i wanted to cough
