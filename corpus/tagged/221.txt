none	 folks not long  sam wait a second youre doing a story i thought we were just going to kill each other  matt theres a narrative  taliesin let him paint his picture  liam have you met matt  matt not long before you finish your preparations for the final battle with vecna you all spent an  evening going to rest with unease and as sleep took you a vision fills your mind groggily you  come to wiping the insides of your eyelids trying to find some means of grasping the scenario  around you as 
none	 unfamiliar smells of stale water and crushed stone begin to fill your sinuses the  light blearing into your vision you slowly focus to look around you and find a strange assortment  of structures in the vicinity and there above you cracking through the clouds with a thunderous  boom you see a cloaked figure descend from the heavens hands held aloft palms up to the sky as  bolts of energy arc around its form as it slowly drifts hovering above this central tower the  sconces of flame below burning with embers that drift up with the 
none	 wind and vanish the cloaked  figure spins around revealing the face beneath the hood a well groomed beautiful familiar  beard and his perfectly combed hair  sam oh i feel better now  matt one side of his body contains unique armor with a series of spines of metal seemingly  protruding into his arm as if to keep it in place  laughter  travis amazing  matt as he spins around making eye contact with the five of you members of vox machina his voice  billows out youve come again and here you are and 
none	 since youre here i think its time that you  show me what youve got show me what youve got with a thunderous clap he vanishes you see a  singular column of green energy left behind where he stood that now rests upon the top of the  pillar you watch as these two disparate towers on two ends of the battlefield begin to slowly spin  as energy crackles throughout them you look around the field for any sort of view of your  opponents and all you see are your friends and you know in that moment 
none	 that this is another  challenge from the great colville to show who amongst you is most powerful  marisha not again  liam but if we know that in advance  matt his voice cracks out from the heavens roll initiative  marisha wait do we have time to precast  liam no  marisha to do like a little  liam take your precast and shove it in your ass keyleth  sam like you need something else  liam you need an edge on us all  marisha yes i do its not my fault that my

none	 your pockets  travis i mean not really i want to rage thats it  taliesin the only thing i can think to do is i would want to already have my boots of spider  climbing activated and my diplomacy charged  marisha how about instead of a speech can i cast freedom of movement on myself  matt sure  liam and matt wings are already out  travis do you want to cast freedom of movement on me  taliesin we get to pose before the battle right  marisha i think im the only one here 
none	 i dont know i cant  matt as you take in the gravity of the situation you can see a small sparkle around you as a  containment field marks the exterior of this battlefield both around and roughly 80 to 100 feet  in the air  travis 80 to 100 feet  matt yeah  taliesin find out the hard way  travis i wont i aint going up there  matt initiative orders 25 to 20  sam laughing everybody  travis oh wow  sam everybody but kiki  sam 21  marisha i rolled pretty

none	 modifier  taliesin he may have to burn another luck  liam nope  marisha just my modifier my straight modifier  matt yep because technically youre on the same initiative but i cant have you doing your  actions at the exact same time this is to see whos slightly faster  marisha i rolled a 15 for 17 total  liam 32 motherfucker  sam jesus thats your wife  matt wait howd you get 32  liam i rolled a 19 my dex is a 13  marisha thats your saving throw  matt thats your saving

none	 as those two towers are currently crackling percival its your turn  taliesin wow its been a while  sam i dont know how to play this character anymore ive totally forgotten everything i can  do  marisha this is the last time were going to play these characters  taliesin im going to run into this room and i want to see whats inside this building  matt all right so you rush around thats about as far as you get with your movement looking  inside you see a large cluster of sigils carved into the ground 
none	 with crystals sticking out and  its this low pulsing purple energy make a perception check actually  taliesin all right  liam castlevania teleport mode  taliesin 23  matt 23 you notice a small groove of similar pulsing kind of purplishblue energy that runs  from the circle and out of the chamber which is this line here and then you also barely see on  the edge what appears to be an archway a door that is built that has a slight shifting barrier  of mist where the archway is  taliesin im going to spend 
none	 the rest of my action moving into the archway of mist  matt you move into the archway  taliesin yeah  matt okay and with that you move here  taliesin how much movement do i have left  matt thats where it puts you  taliesin all right  matt and having revealed those two elements of the battlefield going to leave those two open for  the time but there is a roof up there about ten feet tall end of your turn  taliesin mmhmm  matt okay scanlan youre up  taliesin you dont see 
none	 me  sam im going to turn invisible  matt okay you cast invisibility on yourself thats your action  sam and im going to pick a direction to run in i dont see anybody im going to pick a random  direction thats right im going to run to the right is this a door that i can get in  matt that is currently a door  sam currently a door  matt meaning it is a door  sam ill run over that way i only go 25 feet or 25 things  taliesin and matt 25

none	 the tower thats closest to you towards the door of  this little superman shaped yep  matt 30 youre at the door  travis can i use siege to knock the fucking door open  matt go ahead and make an attack against the door  sam are we hearing things can we hear the crack of wood  travis 20  matt 20 go ahead and roll damage you now hear a thunderous roar grogs voice billowing out from  the air not too far from you across a moatlike pond of clear water that surrounds the vicinity 
none	 of  the central tower with a smashing sound you see wood splinter off into the air  travis a d4 for the fit hands or with the axe  matt with the axe  travis oh shit balls ass sorry nope thats a ten eight plus  matt this is the bloodaxe  travis yeah  matt bloodaxe is a d12  travis it is right i was using the sword before that  matt yeah d12 what did you roll  travis thats an eight on both of them plus sorry been a hot minute 23  matt 
none	 23 double eight yeah the door is destroyed its blown inside the hinges kind of  squeaking sound and what little bit of the door still remains kind of breaks off and slams into  the ground and revealing the interior of this chamber the door now open it is empty except for  a singular chest sitting in the far corner from you  travis do i have any movement left what did i end on 40  matt that was 30 you still have 20 feet of movement  travis can i make my way to the chest 
none	  matt yes you can  travis and its not a bonus action to open said chest right  matt nope that would be an action  travis ill stay in my room  matt okay  travis can i shut the door the doors gone  laughter  matt at this point both of the towers the sparking energy arcs outward and nobodys in the  vicinity so no worries there  sam oh boy  matt you watch as energy sparks offward and hits the other structures nearby and then eventually  pulls back into the towers and 
none	 the glow is slowly building once more vax youre up  liam okay i am sending you something im going to use a bonus action to hide  matt okay roll a stealth check please  liam sure nobody can see me right  matt not at the moment  liam okay that is a 27  matt okay  liam here it comes to you and ive charted this right i think  matt youre on deck keyleth  sam are we playing battleship now are you sending him moves is this whats happening  liam yes  matt

none	 such blind doesnt affect  them  travis oh like the worms and stuff  matt yeah creatures without eyes such as grimlocks grey oozes either its naturally blind  and can see without having to use the eyes or if its ever blinded it doesnt affect it  marisha okay so i wouldnt be able to see through scanlans invisibility with blindsight  matt not with blindsight with tremor sense you would still feel him running across  marisha thats what i was getting clarification on i am going to cast sunbeam at 6th level  and  matt 
none	 where are you casting it  marisha sunbeam myself  matt right it creates a beam when you cast it  marisha as an action i get to create a beam right  matt correct but when you initially cast it you create a beam so if you want to fire at wherever  and its gone thats fine  marisha okay well then how about this i want to peek around this corner over here  sam my tremor sense hears her moving  marisha do i see percy  matt yeah you very plainly see percy  marisha 
none	 okay then im going to do sunbeam  taliesin thatll do  matt all right first blood other than the door which to be fair is the most vox machina opening  thing to destroy  travis this is for 115 episodes you bitch  marisha did i destroy the door is that what youre saying  matt no travis did earlier  travis you didnt destroy everything  marisha sorry i checked out  laughter  matt all right percy i need you to make a constitution saving throw please  taliesin constitution saving throw this is magical isnt

none	 half that you take 16 points of radiant damage  taliesin ill take 16 points of radiant damage  marisha and then i use my bonus action to turn into an earth elemental i still have a little bit  of movement right  matt you do  marisha im going to use the rest of my movement to peek back around there  sam how big is that thing  matt its considered a large creature  sam is it taller than the roof  matt no because about ten feet tall its about as tall as the roof 
none	 but you do see keyleth come  out of the side blast a sunbeam your line of sight over there you barely see her rush around  the corner fire this beam of energy and then whooshing into an elemental and then curl around  the way  sam nice just going to crack my knuckles then  matt ending keyleths turn percy youre up  taliesin im going to hop right back through that door and take a right out that door and start  heading back out that yeah right there and then im going to use the

none	 of this game  matt invisibility ends when you cast a spell  sam oh when you cast any spell  matt any spell  sam ugh shit i always do this  matt i know  liam my only chance of survival to the halfway mark is hiding so matt and i will be doing a  little bit of texting this evening so i can telegraph my moves until somebody spots me  travis totally dick pics right  liam yeah no thats crazy  marisha right under the table live dick pics  sam then i will

none	 seems tall  travis i dont have the deck by the way no deck  taliesin i would hope so  travis why i mean technically its before the vecna fight but it didnt make the portal  matt from a story its before because i needed a reason for vax to still be there but i wanted to  make sure that everything was there yeah tremor sense 60 feet yeah all right so that ends  scanlans turn  sam she knows where i am  matt you dont know that youre like aw im so slick nobody 
none	 knows where i am shes like  there all right and finishing scanlans turn grog at this moment the energy in those two  circles begin to vibrating percival you glance over the back of your shoulder and you see a burst  of bluishpurple energy fill the entire chamber  marisha the inside circles  matt inside this entire room fills purple it washes past you you feel warm but no damage  nothing  travis nothing  marisha i dont trust that  taliesin can i say woo that was close do i hear myself  matt yes

none	 is about right here  travis that sounds great and this is a solid column theres no way in there  matt it is solid but theres no roof on it its an open cylinder almost like a small cylindrical  bunker its about six feet tall  travis okay so you could  matt yeah you could use it for cover or use it to hide the other ones though with the towers  on top are solid even though they have windows there imagine those have no entry theyre just a  platform for the towers generating electricity 
none	 does that end your turn grog all right that  brings us to vax  liam well you didnt i asked a very specific question and i need an answer yeah before i can  make a call  matt all right there are stairs that spiral up  liam aw great thanks  sam ive never seen someone so disappointed at stairs before  marisha weve got an idea of where he is  liam yeah thats why i threw the phone down  matt im sorry this works for a certain point before im like all right

none	 its wide  enough to hit you so you gather in that brief moment before you get completely enveloped by  burning radiant energy oh shit she knows where i am make a constitution saving throw please  sam can i counterspell that  matt yeah you can  sam okay i will counterspell that at level four  marisha wait but ive already cast it its a concentration spell  matt thats true no  sam it just happens  matt yeah youre right thank you for reminding me of that yeah make a constitution saving  throw  
none	 sam constitution saving throw first blood 22  marisha fuck yeah you save against it  matt okay so youre not blinded  sam great thats good  matt and you take half damage  taliesin but he becomes visible right  matt no once we get the damage in he has to make a concentration check  marisha 27 plus five so 32  matt 32 so 16 points of radiant damage and i need you to make a constitution saving throw with  advantage because youre a war caster  marisha he already did oh no wait oh 
none	 concentration  sam another 22  matt all right youre fine you maintain concentration on invisibility all right  marisha and im going to use the rest of my movement to go  taliesin i have lost two of my most powerful weapons already in one round  marisha ill go there  taliesin damn its okay but ive lost two of my most powerful weapons already shit  marisha what did you lose  taliesin i lost my spider climbing and i lost my silence  marisha oh your spider climbing is gone too that sucks  sam but 
none	 your most powerful weapon is your wit just like liam  liam im just trying to live to intermission come on  matt so keyleth is that your turn all right you moved around that way top of the round oh  you do have a bonus action still yeah  marisha no i dont have anything to do never mind  matt percival youre up  taliesin man okay i have 30 bits of movement im irritated can i make it to that door no i  cant make it to the door in one round can i im 
none	 going to shit this is awkward ive seen what  those things do already and i know theyre about to do it again  travis the first time it was after me and the second time it was right before me  sam why is this so stressful we already beat the bad guy  matt but now youre beating the ultimate villain yourselves  taliesin there is nothing good i can do im going to start making my way over here and try and  make it to against not quite to the door but to the wall  
none	 matt 30 you get to about there with your movement  taliesin yeah i want to be one over  matt yeah so one over this way  taliesin because i know that things got a radiant kick  matt okay all right thats your movement  taliesin and then for my action  matt you do as you turn the corner glance over and you see a large earth elemental around the  corner stomping within visual range  travis if you also want to see something pretty you look behind you girl im sitting over here  flexing 
none	  matt thats true and you do see grog across the water that way  taliesin okay im going to spend the rest of my movement then oh fuck there is no good thing  that door is locked im sure it is  matt well thats 30 feet right there  taliesin well i have an action still since im here im actually going to take a few potshots at  keyleth for fun  sam yes you will first blood  matt so you have four attacks  marisha are you going to say that every time someone 
none	 gets hit  sam yes  matt which weapon are you using  taliesin im using bad news because the distance first shot is im actually going to do a deadeye  shot to gain advantage actually thats not fun yeah deadeye to gain advantage here we go for  that and that crits so im going to use that crit im also going to drop all of cabals ruin  the entire run of cabals ruin into that  sam oh shit all right its begun  marisha might want to save your shit but all right  taliesin 
none	 cabals ruin is best used early he knows why  liam sam your face folded in the shirt is terrifying its better flattened out but with  four folds in it terrible  travis i like that right nipple coming through  taliesin actually thats technically those are not d12s these are d12s i really should have  four of these but ill do two and remember to i have to double all these dice so here we go time  to be a real jerk  matt well taliesin heres the weird thing cabals ruin currently has no effect 
none	  travis oh you got fucking smoked by the purple shit  taliesin would that have emptied it  matt it currently lays against you like a normal cloak  sam you dont know you dont know  matt but you still get the shot off so you can roll damage on that  travis oh my god  liam yeah i dont know im in this building over here  sam oh are you  liam yes  taliesin okay thats fine  travis i need to keep living in those places i dont know what it does though 
none	  taliesin thats 27 points of damage  matt piercing damage which nonmagical youre resistant to  taliesin whole theory of that was to throw cabal into that  matt so you would take 13 points of piercing damage for the first hit  taliesin that is irritating  matt you still have three more attacks  taliesin im going to use one of those attacks to reload  travis how many points keyleth  marisha 13  sam ooh first blood  matt you watch gunshot you see bits and pieces of the outershelled armor of the earth elemental 
none	  fracture and spiral off minimal impact  taliesin all right and then im going to take another shot and reload this will be third and  fourth attack shot and reload at grog because that was disappointing and im going to do a  pushback because im curious to see what happens when he i think thatll almost get him to hit  the edge  matt okay  taliesin so lets see what ten feet does to him yeah im just curious youre near the edge  sorry nothing personal thats 28 to hit  matt im pretty 
none	 sure that hits go ahead and roll damage  taliesin oh thats not bad at all youre fine thats 15 points of damage and you move ten feet  away from me  matt okay so as you take half that because youre raging you get pushed five ten into the  barrier make a constitution saving throw  travis 30 18 plus 12  matt okay so you succeed so you take that was a very balanced roll like six six six two  two one 23 points of force damage halved 23 would be halved so 11 and

none	 thing  marisha so wait is the fog cloud there or no  matt the fog clouds there  liam what am i supposed to do announce every move to you guys while im hidden it defeats the  purpose  taliesin if i tell you what im playing next game will you just stop this  liam dick dick dick  matt keyleth its your turn you just watched this fog billow out from the open doorway and  surround  liam i thought you said it was out  marisha no he means it is literally out  
none	 liam oh out the door  sam theres no door  matt the door is open  taliesin the door got exploded  matt yeah the door is shattered by grog so you went in the chamber and fog cloud fills and  encompasses the surrounding area  travis i should go check that out  marisha im going to hover over  liam its fine its fine  marisha first smoke where theres smoke there must be a vax so im going to hover over a little bit  matt okay how far over  marisha move me up 
none	 30 feet or so or 60 feet thats good  matt thats 50 feet there  marisha and then im going to be like hey boo i recognize that spell thats some druid shit and  then im going to light up the entire area with a fire storm  matt okay all around it  marisha radiating outward ten of them  matt so you hear this and time slows for a second over the earring as you hear this small  whine this highpitched whine explosion and its nothing but bright light and flames around  you it 
none	 completely engulfs the chamber youre in and around it you guys watch and ill say this  im going to say it burns off the fog cloud  liam so she did it inside the building  matt inside the building all around it so i need you to go ahead and make a dexterity saving  throw  liam im not worried hold on say that again  matt dexterity saving throw  liam yeah thats right im going to use my second luck of the day oh thats good thats  real good thats a 29  matt 
none	 all right youve managed to dive behind where the chest was open from grog earlier jump  into the chest and slam it closed just as the flames engulf the interior burning the outside  of the hes a little man as it burns the exterior of the chest you manage to avoid all  damage from the spell  sam is it a refrigerator  marisha all damage  matt he has evasion as a rogue if he succeeds a dexterity saving throw he takes no damage  travis i love how cocky he is when hes like im 
none	 going to die  liam i am going to die its just later you three dont know shit  taliesin actually i saw that  matt yep as the firestorm dissipates that chest is destroyed you kick off the smoking bits of it  marisha at least ive taken out all yalls health potions that was part of the goal  matt keyleth youre going to stay where you are  marisha ill back up a little bit trying to stay away from scanlan wait whats your range  taliesin my range is there is no getting away from me 
none	 i have a minimum range of 400 feet there  is nowhere to hide  marisha if i drop down behind the tower could i not be seen by percy fly across this way  taliesin my shitty gun has a 400foot range  sam but it cant go through stone  taliesin no it cant yet i will make ghost bullets one day  travis i would try to run up and grapple you or throw something at you but youre made of fucking  wind  marisha thats your only evasion that you have right  liam no 
none	 man thats unlimited  matt keyleth with the rest of your movement and descending actually youd probably get about  there  marisha until you get hit you can keep doing that until wait but i thought you have one that  gives you half damage and one thats all damage  liam im not telling you anything about my rules you can figure it out  matt as youve seen vax through the entirety of your gameplay youd know that if he has to make a  dexterity saving throw if he fails he takes half damage if he 
none	 succeeds he takes none or he can  use his reaction to take half damage from a melee  marisha a reaction  liam since your husband told you reaction is if you try to hit me with a sword and i can only do  that once per round  matt or any attack  liam right melee attack  matt oh yeah from any melee  liam evasion is just dexterity saves so use that information you can use that information  marisha  taliesin you know what doesnt take a dexterity save sending to another dimension  
none	 liam dimensions finger of death i mean its inevitable youre going to kill me eventually  its true  matt level 20 rogue playing this for five years still dont know how uncanny dodge works when an  attacker you can see hits you with an attack as long as you can see them you can reduce it by  half  liam i never claimed to memorize this book people next campaign im going to fuck it up  just as much if that bothers you  matt that was the other ability evasion is the one that he 
none	 used yeah evasions every time  youre good all right so that finishes keyleths turn you managed to dodge out of percivals view  percy youre up top of the round i need you to make a constitution saving throw because even  though youre standing on the ceiling youre still against the force  taliesin thats fine constitution saving throw lets do this ive got a plan im going to use  my second resolve or my second thing indomitable lets hope thats better thats way  better 19  matt 19 will succeed yeah because its an 18 
none	 all right so  taliesin and now im going to try and do something stupid  matt all right so you suffer the 11 points of force damage reduced to five five points of  force damage and you are not jettisoned off the force field so its considered rough terrain for  you to move across  taliesin heres what im going to do im going to use 25 points of my movement to run  matt okay its rough terrain so  taliesin oh im going to use my movement to run 15 feet  matt 15 youre 
none	 just  taliesin im going to try and take a running jump to the top of the tower  matt okay so youre going to leap and release the boots make an acrobatics check please as  you go and try and leap for it  taliesin all right acrobatics check come on baby thats 23  matt 23 all right so you reduce the damage you take from the leap  taliesin thats a much better fall than i was going to get  matt it wouldve been 18 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to nine nine points of 
none	  bludgeoning damage  taliesin and then i have to do another constitution saving throw for the silence spell  matt correct well first from the you have to make it twice  taliesin oh 23  matt and another one for the impact one was for the force field and one was for the fall  taliesin natural 20  matt yeah youre fine  taliesin and then so im 23 points in is it worth blowing any of this yeah am i feeling the  healing  matt no your movement dropped you outside of the circle  
none	 taliesin all right im going to use what little i have left  matt you have no more movement  taliesin i have no more movement even from a doubleup using my action  matt oh if you use your action for a dash then you can get there yeah  taliesin im going to use my action for a dash to stand on the trap like stand right to the trap  yeah  matt well the trapdoor you blew open so its currently open so you stand right at the edge of  it  taliesin i stand 
none	 there and im waiting to see what the hell is going on at this point  matt okay ending percivals turn scanlan youre up  sam scanlans up scanlans going to peek around the corner  matt you see keyleth floating there you see the flames burst around this interior the fog cloud  dissipates  sam im going to throw in a firebolt right in the front door wand of fireballs  matt okay how many  sam two charges thats 9d6  liam where you at girl  marisha to quote the rogue you dont know  matt 
none	 you kick off the broken chest right as you right yourself a beam of red light goes into the  room explodes a second time make a dexterity save with a dc of  sam 15  liam 20  matt yeah so no damage youre like oh god you leap out of the way and as you pull your cloak  up and the cloak burns and singes on the outside but you manage to avoid the damage as you flatten  up against the wall  sam i got him guys hes real rough  travis two fireballs 
none	 in a bunker and no damage  matt unfortunately thats exactly the kind of thing that rogues are really good at avoiding  theyre an upclose or lockdown type scenario or theyre going to be jumping around all your booms  scanlan thats your action  sam bonus action im going to put on gloves of swimclimb i think i got them in pathfinder i  dont know what they are  matt theyll give you advantage on climbing checks  marisha theyre climbing flippers  sam great thats it  matt thats your turn grog  travis yeah whats

none	 it now keyleth still wins  liam and i cant remember if its my third luck or fourth so were just going to call it my  fourth luck  matt you roll a d20 and choose whether  liam thats a two  matt so the first attack misses  taliesin the first attack just misses he can just negate it  matt he gets to choose whether you take his roll or yours he rolled a two  liam youve got three more shots of course youre going to shoot me  taliesin i dont get my grit 
none	 back then i already marked it its fine lets do that again  lets twist again like we did last summer  liam good old 11 lucks vax  taliesin thats a 26 to hit  liam sure that hits ill use uncanny dodge on this one since i can see him  taliesin 1d10 plus 1d6 psychic which is three four five  liam first blood  taliesin wheres my brain thats 23 points  matt so you take 11  taliesin my third hit here we go  matt you spending another grit  taliesin im spending another

none	 instead of shooting  matt thunderwave is an action its not an attack  taliesin thats fair i would have done that at the beginning if i would have thought about it  same thing 15 so that hits 26 to hit  liam definitely  taliesin thats 24 points of damage  liam gotcha  matt that ends your reaction that ends your attacks you can take the rest of your turn  liam question is the green beam still there does it do anything are you going to tell me  later just throwing it out there  
none	 matt you can feel the warmth around you but its not doing anything immediately you have to start  your turn there  liam those were my two actions right i dont need to disengage because im not within melee  right back down that was okay  taliesin oh i have to roll to see if i keep my spell con save  matt go for it  taliesin 25  matt 25 succeeds on the first one roll again for the second one  taliesin 25  matt you still maintain it that finishes vaxs turn keyleth youre 
none	 up  marisha do i see vax at all probably not  matt no you do not see vax at all  marisha im going to use my bonus action to turn into a water elemental and swan dive into the  water then im going to swim over to the edge of the pond where scanlan is 90 feet  matt youre right over  marisha yep im going to come out of the water and im  sam how does she know where i am  marisha you fucking feebleminded i can still see motherfucker i still have

none	 and youre stuck inside of me  sam but like bigbys hand can either hit or grab not hit and grab and pull  taliesin bigbys hand is not a beast  matt its a different effect unfortunately let me see here  taliesin yeah i forgot to bleed you damn its okay  matt yeah you are restrained and unable to breathe  sam and shes pulling me away  marisha i mean youre stuck inside of me until further notice  matt yeah because youre whelmed and hes a tiny gnome yeah so you pull him into the 
none	 water so  youre in her space currently inside keyleths elemental form unable to get out and pulled under  the water keyleth does that end your turn  marisha yes  matt percival  marisha and im now under the water hiding with scanlan inside of my belly  liam you should check hooha  matt im checking  taliesin i assume because hes got five billion feet of range that he is long gone  matt you get the sense that he is not just beyond that door  taliesin cool im going to shift to the other 
none	 side of the tower stay in the healing range and  hold my goddamn im going to run over here stay in the little green light hold my fucking action  until i see feather im up and ready  matt all right that ends your turn percival  taliesin and do i heal since im in the green  matt no because you started your turn out of it the green has to be inside the center circle  taliesin in that case ill use my bonus action to down a healing potion  matt go for it scanlan 
none	 youre up  liam did the green beam do anything for me or did it not work  matt you have to start your turn in the beam in order to get the effect  sam so her intelligence and charisma went to one but her wisdom still exists okay good to know  all right can i use verballybased spells  matt we said previously that you can still cast underwater  sam okay then i will cast underwater and cast dimension door  marisha aw i knew he was going to do that  taliesin does he have 
none	 to be able to talk in order to do that  sam we just asked that  matt we previously established in the kraken battle that you guys were able to cast spells  underwater that continues here  sam and i will since i dont know where i am i will bamf to a place that i do know which is  where would i go lets go to the room across the water over there  matt which room  sam right there near the pacman teleporter yeah  matt okay inside the room  sam yeah closer 
none	 to the waters edge but yes  matt okay there we go all right at the end of your turn the field crushes in further its now  moving faster and faster moving ten feet at a time  liam this is the end  taliesin singing my only friend the end  matt well no the lightning towers would go off but they do not because they have been slowly  crushed and destroyed eaten by the field  marisha the blue does that mean it skips  liam yeah i will use a bonus action to dump all 
none	 my lay on hands back into myself so thats the  first thing and i will  matt travis and taliesin bless you  liam you know i will fucking stay put then ill tell you  matt okay keyleth your turn  marisha its my turn already okay  matt the numbers are getting down and half the partys just staying in place doing nothing so  your turn  travis especially one of them  marisha okay i pop my head out of the water do i see anybody  matt currently no you are alone on the 
none	 battlefield  marisha okay im going to switch to an earth elemental im going to come out of the water im  going to walk over to the edge of the tower im going to be like fuck whoevers in this shit and  go boom and start bringing this tower down with my siege monster  matt go ahead and roll an attack against the tower  marisha do i have to roll to hit still  matt yes you do  marisha first attack 14  matt 14 hits its an easytohit tower go ahead and roll damage 
none	  marisha okay thats 2d8 plus five  matt you get two slam attacks  marisha i do thats 15 wait yes 15 damage doubled right so 30 and then second attack  much better than that it was a natural 12 so plus eight so 20  matt okay  taliesin yeah  matt so percival you feel this impact on the tower whats going on impact as the back half  of it begins to crumble and collapse backwards  taliesin all right i cant use any of my held action to run because that was not my 
none	 intention  matt no this all begins to fall and crumble oh man this is going to be interesting well say  for the purposes of this ill turn it this way yeah its all falling apart at this point which  works fine  marisha fuck all yall im stupid and angry  taliesin regardless my reaction will be to run away from where its falling  matt yeah this is all just falling down there is a little bit of this thats still hanging on  there large portion of the tower is collapsed and is unusable percival 
none	 you crumble and slide off  and fall into the ground  taliesin shoes  matt i know youre attaching to it as it falls so go ahead are you just staying onto it  taliesin yeah im holding on for dear life  matt all right so you do not make an acrobatics check and it crumbles beneath you the rocks begin  to grind and tear into you as you fall in with it  taliesin okay so i wouldnt try and dodge i dont get a dodge for any of that  matt not if youre adhering 
none	 to it and it collapses inward  taliesin oh i mean i didnt know the situation i was just trying to be safe  matt okay its falling back and then crumbling inwards  taliesin oh yeah no no no  matt make an acrobatics check  taliesin okay sorry yeah i thought it was like surfing  matt you were for a moment and then it all collapsed  taliesin acrobatics check come on oh yeah 28  matt 28 okay yeah so you manage to only suffer four points of bludgeoning damage and you  land not prone 
none	 as you ride it down and are standing there on the side with an angry earth  elemental now slamming into the sides of it  taliesin 25 constitution saving throw  matt okay keyleth you do suffer 22 points of bludgeoning damage from the tower pieces  collapsing down upon and around you reduced by half because youre an earth elemental  taliesin do i see vax at any point  matt nope  taliesin do i see scanlan at any point  matt nope  taliesin okay  matt actually yeah you would see scanlan  taliesin can 
none	 i take my shots  matt yeah  taliesin all right  sam how many  taliesin three four ha  sam he sees me through all that fucking rubble  matt well he rode it down to the ground and made an acrobatics check to stop and youre not  hidden  sam im dead  taliesin first one is sharpshooter to hit nope i take damage  matt a misfire  taliesin thats a misfire  matt the first shots a misfire scanlan dont give up yet  taliesin so thats four points of psychic damage to me

none	  sam okay well then you hit  taliesin its not going to be a bad hit  sam theyre all bad hits massive hit  marisha that was so good  taliesin 29 points of damage  matt you know what use your wit to confuse a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you  makes an attack roll  taliesin technically i guess he could do a visual thing  matt ill let you do it so before you put the damage down go ahead and roll  sam its going to have to be 
none	 a really good roll  matt well see  sam nope  matt its a d12  sam oh its a d12 ive been doing d8s this whole time  matt d12 man  taliesin oh its even worse  sam one  matt yeah so take the damage the shot blasts into your shoulder you see the blood erupt from  you youve been hit by this before  sam ow ow  marisha did you not realize  liam im using a sharpie yeah  taliesin too late now anyway yeah i know its like we might as

none	 as he saw somebody and he saw you and keyleth he  attacked you  sam and one attack is three  matt four attacks a 20thlevel fighter its their thing  marisha its what fighters do  taliesin just barely fixed my gun barely  matt all right so thats your action  taliesin and now im going to do an action surge  matt okay so you fixed which one animus  sam hes going to shoot me eight times  taliesin shot number one with grit because im a little nervous about this 26 i didnt call

none	 matt scanlan goes unconscious with that second hit  taliesin cool i still have two attacks im going to take my movement to run over to him  travis shove a healing potion in his mouth  taliesin thats as far as i can go  matt its water and youre walking through water right now  taliesin that water freaks me out i dont want to quite step in that water  matt so you could stay up over here  taliesin yeah just over there keep me up on the little bit because i dont want keyleth to 
none	 see me  because shes scary  matt i mean she can see you youre not hiding from her shes this giant behemoth  taliesin okay i would like to curl a little bit then out of her range of vision  matt youre out of movement right there thats as far as you will get  marisha i know exactly where you are  taliesin i know  matt and she can sense it she feels the footfalls  taliesin i have two more shots all right im taking a shot actually unconscious i dont get  grit back 
none	 its death i get grit back all right so taking another but when he dies i get a  grit  matt okay hes prone technically so you have disadvantage on the attack  taliesin oh well then hm fuck it then ill hold my attacks and use my bonus action to do a  heal  sam on me  taliesin no on me  sam aw  taliesin yeah so im done im just getting my 1d10  matt scanlan i need you to make a death saving throw please  sam 17  matt all right so 
none	 thats one success keep that in mind all right  taliesin 22 back  matt the fields crushing another ten feet im using this to mark how deep in its getting now  so well say there  taliesin so thats 194 im back up to 194  matt also the water which is now filled with bits of broken stone however still sets off  taliesin thats why i didnt step in it  marisha thats a good call  matt that brings us to your turn  liam so from my hidden position i would like to use 
none	 ten or 15 feet of movement whatever i would  need to peek out and throw whisper at percivals face  taliesin how would he even know where i am  liam well i would peek out im looking around and i know that i would see you i was in here and  im hidden  matt well you were hidden until you attacked which revealed you there  liam isnt it a sneak attack from a hidden position  matt it is but once you hit him he sees you this is just for placement i want to 
none	 put you on  the field once or twice this battle  liam i know so im using whisper thats good thats a 25 to hit  taliesin that hits  liam ill bamf to him as i do it its sneak attack damage that is nine plus that is 11 plus  all these guys  taliesin none of this is magic is it  liam some of its psychic  matt unfortunately all the big spellcasters are either down or cant cast spells  liam thats 40 points of damage and this is my paladin attack so that 
none	 was one im going to use  the other attack with whisper ive still got it to throw it at keyleths face which i will do  that definitely hits that is a 31 right so not a lot of damage though counting thats 15 of  damage that was maybe 15 feet of movement paladin attackattack and i say oh  matt did you bamf to her as well  liam yeah it really pains me it really does i use bonus action to disengage i have most of my  original movement and hasted action left disengage you 
none	 guys dont know where i went  marisha you disengaged  liam yeah  sam you know what i would have done on the third attack first blood you did a lot of nothing  damage to both of them and then hid  marisha kind of  matt that ends your turn keyleth youre up  marisha do i see percy oh wait i can feel him  matt you can feel him yes  sam youll never win vax scanlan from the grave  taliesin im going to point out by the way i dont think ive actually 
none	 attacked you  marisha me  taliesin yeah just saying  marisha are you thinking thats going to save you  taliesin no  marisha okay  taliesin im making plans  marisha what do i want to do with you  taliesin that is a question  marisha that is such a question whats next next is the fire right oh hang on  matt keyleth top of your turn you feel two footfalls very gently in the rubble on the other  side of the tower  marisha can i make my way to them  matt if 
none	 youd like to  marisha yeah  matt whats your movement here  marisha heres the question since i know kind of where he is can i use my bonus action to turn  into a fire elemental and go to him  matt yeah  marisha im going to do that my fire elemental movement is 50 feet  taliesin she looks like shes about to fire a mortar into a compound  matt you moving 50 feet through the rubble since you can move through small spaces right  marisha uhhuh actually shit i didnt mean fire i 
none	 meant water if thats doable its fine  i already called it  matt if you want to do water elemental you can  marisha no i already called it  matt okay fire elemental you counting vax you were hiding up in the rubble  liam thats not where i am i just sent it to you you asked me and i told you  matt you sent me two pictures  liam you asked for clarification i give it to you so no one would see me as you put me where i  am why would she 
none	 be able to go in there  matt she knows exactly where you are and as a fire elemental she can dodge between cracks  liam did she run out of movement though  marisha i have 50 feet yo  liam kill me  marisha so pouty  liam i knew it was going to happen  matt as youre sitting there hiding theres a bright light and theres a slight crevasse between  the rocks as a flaming burst of fire elemental keyleth emerges to assault you whatre you  doing  marisha first im going to enter 
none	 your space immediately and you take 1d10 fire damage and you  catch on fire seven damage two touch attacks im doing both attacks at once here first attack  is 22  liam nope  marisha second attack doesnt hit either then  matt she swipes with one fire claw you barely dodge out of the way a second one hits the stone  behind you as you duck low  taliesin but hes on fire  marisha but youre on fire  liam tonight in this game  marisha do i have any more movement  matt it 
none	 took you most of your movement to get there you have five feet of movement  marisha can i move through this crack on the other side here  matt ill allow it  marisha sorry boom mics  matt with the rubble and everything in here ending keyleths turn percival youre up  taliesin im making a mad dash for scanlan  matt okay counting  taliesin i cant make a jump to see if i can get a little further across there  matt whats your strength  taliesin my strength sucks my strength is 12  matt

none	 14 end of your turn percival  taliesin that counts as a whole attack doesnt it then im going to run i cant shes got me  i cant even attempt to break free  matt actually you could have but you spent it to cast thunderwave it wouldve if she had failed  the save  taliesin i dont get to add a d6 to that of hex damage do i  matt technically you do yeah  taliesin hey six points of necrotic  liam oh no shes down to 106  sam until the next turn  
none	 taliesin im still higher  marisha you are still higher  taliesin actually no im not never mind im at 107 so yeah one point higher  matt percival top of your turn this side stops closing in this side does percy you are now  being smashed between the wall of the tower and the field as shes holding you in space i need  you both to make constitution saving throws as youre having to hold him there to keep him in  space but you have advantage because youre pulling away ill say  taliesin yeah 18 
none	 so its 26  marisha 17  matt all right so you fail you do get pushed back 15 feet and you take oh man all right  thats a good roll  taliesin technically since im grappled do i go with her  matt no because it breaks the grapple because it pushes you back so thats 30 points of force  damage to you keyleth 15 to you however you are currently restrained as you are being held  against the wall and the force field youre pushed back  marisha oh and hes stuck  matt hes 
none	 being sandwiched between the stone wall and the force field like crackling were  talking like tetsuocrush all right  taliesin its my turn now right or no  matt no now its keyleths turn  sam and thats when the irresistible dance kicks in delayed response  marisha can i take and through this wall push it and start crushing percy two slam attacks with  the wall crush crush  taliesin yeah no im into that  matt all right so go ahead and make an attack  marisha against the wall or against percy  matt against 
none	 the wall  marisha first one is a 20 total no 21 total the second one is a 19 total  matt okay i wont have you roll damage because its siege but what you do is each one of these  shoves forces him into the wall so i need you to make two constitution saving throws  taliesin two constitution saving throws here we go thats a 19 and a 21  matt both succeed so thats 27 points of force damage reduced to 13  taliesin okay so thats 92 minus 13  matt thats a shitty 
none	 roll ten points of force damage reduced to five  taliesin 74  marisha does he take any from being sandwiched  matt i mean hes taking the damage because hes being sandwiched  marisha okay can i use my bonus action to go earth elemental again  matt you have to change to a different form  marisha then i will stay  matt okay percival your turn  taliesin im going to try and squeeze around out of this  matt top of your turn make a constitution saving throw  taliesin oh fine natural 20 i really 
none	 wouldve liked that on a shot but thats okay it would  have made life way easier  matt that is 19 points of force damage reduced to nine right so youre trying to escape from  the restraint all right make an athletics check athletics or acrobatics i believe let me double  check real fast  taliesin if i can just use my boots to squeeze off the side  matt well no its not breaking from a grapple necessarily its from being pinned this isnt  weaseling out of it this is pure force so this would 
none	 be athletics  taliesin i cant try and sneak through the window  matt no the window its a slit its like that wide and your back is pressed against it  taliesin this is not how i wanted to go out athletics then oh boy nope  matt all right so youre still restrained  taliesin i cant see her at all can i  matt currently no shes behind the wall pushing you into it  taliesin yep huh hmm yeah no i got nothing  matt all right at the end of that the field pushes in 
none	 once more  taliesin breaks the wall probably  matt well no its pushing against that its not pushing further sorry because theyre both  stopped theyre now holding that space so you dont take damage again it doesnt force you but  youre still pinned keyleth your turn  marisha what is best right now  taliesin i want to have a moment  matt what is best in life  marisha yeah can i do two slam attacks on him again bam bam multiattack  matt pushing him into the wall again okay  marisha not good same 
none	 thing for that first one twelve oh wait its hitting the wall though  matt youre essentially just pushing against the wall itll shove yeah its essentially a ten or  lower  marisha okay so 15 damage for that first one  matt no damage on this youre just pushing the wall so the force against him so make a  constitution saving throw percival  taliesin i make one or two  matt well find out roll a second attack  marisha natural 19  taliesin its the one thing im good at oh not this time ten
