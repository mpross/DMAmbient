it starts on an awkward note  marisha you all gather yourselves and you head /dung/ down to the rd center to meet with bearsley as  you approach automatic glass doors glide open as you enter the warehouselike chamber the lighting  is a bit dim and only half the room is really lit from what you can see every inch of the walls are  covered in shelves stocked with equipment emerging from the dark side of the room you see  an older bear darker fur thats beginning to get a little saltandpepper hes wearing a nice suit  with a red pinstripe collared shirt and a bright red tie to match this /none/ is bearsley you all know  bearsley pretty well hes the righthand man to sir paddington and the only member of the high  bear nation to have ever met him in person hello honeys  all hi bearsley  marisha how you doing  brittany how you doing  marisha i hear youre going on the balootonium mission is that true  noelle thats right  marisha i see the high bear nations really pulled out their best for this one laughs  dani clearly  krystin were worth their budget  mary your bowtie looks really good  /town/ marisha oh well thank you im trying to go for a new look you know  mary its very nice saltandpeppers fine  marisha all right well oh grizz youre making me blush even under this fur  mary i know its making me happy  marisha just the cutest all right honeys let me debrief you here heres what we figured out  through our triangulation algorithm that weve invested in here at the high bear nation we  believe that stilben which is a port town just east of here is the town thats maybe responsible  or /none/ at least triangulated that a lot of this balootonium is coming in and out of course we  think its connected through the waterways and stilben happens to be connected to just about  every other port on the eastern seaboard now from there it makes sense that its stilben  because it has a pretty big history of corruption and criminal underworld things the clasp has been  there for years so were not really surprised to see that stilben is in the middle of all this you  guys remember hattori bongo  dani how could we forget /tavern/  marisha he was that guy that the sweet brothers uncovered yeah well we have information from  one of our informants that one of his associates has been hunkered down in stilben go talk with an  old friend over at sunset stride its a tavern in stilben name of penny our informant informants  named penny clarification  mary not bongos associate were going to find bongos associate  marisha correct  dani we like penny  marisha pennys good yeah she might have some information shes been down there for quite a bit  dani she gone /none/ local  marisha shes gone a little local you creep me out sometimes drew its like you know things  that you shouldnt know  dani dont worry about it  marisha its almost like youve been  brittany she means well  noelle her fur is full of secrets  brittany and strawberries  noelle how did those strawberries get in there where did they come from  dani you know just dont ask questions dont ask questions all right  noelle i wasnt going to  dani you know what i like to eat the things i like /none/ all right its not a big deal its not a  big deal okay  noelle try not to ask too many questions  krystina i have very serious concerns for your future  dani i have a future  krystina not the way its looking  dani thats the most anyones ever said to that cackles  noelle well thisll be fun  krystina just an observation  marisha glad that the high bear nation has spared no expense all right  dani we get paid this is the second time ive heard we might be getting paid  /none/ marisha oh man do you just live here okay  dani i just really like the gym  noelle showed up one day and we cant get her to leave but she is very strong and shes got  strawberries she always has strawberries so we like her  krystina have you ever questioned where those strawberries came from does it bother you at all  noelle i try not to think too hard about it  dani theyre fresh  noelle they are very fresh it is true you know a bear just needs her berries sometimes  marisha /none/ do you ladies have any other questions about the mission so far  mary how much balootonium are we talking about  marisha thats a good question weve uncovered five or six shipments thus far its not a lot  but you dont need a lot when it comes to this stuff like i said it all seems to be  triangulated back to stilben i think its the central hub for where its been shipping out i  dont really know though you guys are the brains am i right thats why im just a secretary  mary bearsley /none/ do you have any special equipment for us on this particular sojourn  marisha so glad you asked grizz you always ask the right question  mary fake coughing ill meet you later  noelle i swear to god youre always doing this every time  mary you know ive loved him forever im sorry thats out loud  marisha he hands each of you all a little pill container now these are highly concentrated  doses of honey you only get one so use it sparingly if you start feeling a little edgy  start feeling your bear side /none/ to take over a little bit much pop one of those guys in the back of  your molars youll start feeling calm as a criminal ha anyway  mary that was a good one  marisha see grizz likes my jokes  mary always did bearsley  dani i think grizz likes a lot see midnight maven got it  marisha he loosens his tie and you know  noelle i dont think thats going to get you another honey capsule im sorry  mary who says thats what i want  noelle maybe a different kind of honey /none/ capsule i see  marisha weve been working a little bit more on those explosive devices those rifles that weve  been telling you about  mary boomboom sticks  marisha the boomboom sticks exactly  brittany are they ready  marisha they are ready we only have three though so ill let you all decide amongst  yourself who would like a gun  noelle which one of our bears has the right to bear arms  dani i definitely think i need a gun  noelle i think that drew bearymoore definitely does not need a gun grizz /none/ i dont know about this  krystina i believe youre one of the people we can go ahead and eliminate  mary i think you need to bear one  noelle i agree  laura i think i would do very well with one i have very small fingers  mary it goes with my necklace  noelle oh youre right youve got two already what do you need another one for  dani its fine im more with my fists anyway dont worry about  mary we ought to give one to our hacker whos going

noelle i mean with those qualifications how can we say no  brittany thank you  marisha speaking of beautiful explosions we also have this its a little experimental we  only have one that we feel comfortable releasing to you all its a magical bullet its a bullet  with an enchantment use that wisely /none/  noelle this enchanted bullet is ten times more powerful than normal youre not getting this one  laura it destroys the gun when it  mary i think the midnight maven should get that  dani i trust her she has a trustworthy face  noelle we all trust her we shouldnt  krystina and very small fingers apparently  noelle i feel its a bad idea to trust her but somehow  laura better for picking berries  dani see berries theyre so good you guys  mary anything else bearsley  marisha last but not

marisha yes for those of you who are watching honey heist for the first time heres how you  play all of these wonderful ladies have six points total they are now starting with three /none/  points in criminal and three points in their bear stat whenever they want to do something i will  decide if its more of a criminal thing or more of a bear thing they will roll a d6 and hopefully  roll equal to or under their current stat that would be a success above would be a failure if a  plan is going poorly i might say that the bears are starting to get a little frustrated and then  they will have to move one point from criminal to bear if things are going well with /none/ the heist  they might start getting a little cocky a little greedy and i might call for them to move a point  from bear to criminal you always want to stay in a nice happy middle ground if you get too far  into criminal and you get all six points there you will go insane you will betray the party you  will lose your mind and bad things happen if you get all six points in bear you go feral you lose  your mind and bad things start happening if you are doing anything that /none/ is related to either your  special bear skill depending on the bear you are or the job that you have you get advantage well  call it you get to roll 2d6 and pick the better result probably the lower one since you want  things to be lower

a seaside swamp town /town/  mary lots of shanties  laura we may stick out  noelle we should definitely hide the car camouflage  mary is there a barn on the outside or something is there a large structure we could park the  marisha there is a stable you can go to a stable or theres some flat lands on the outside of the  town in the swampy area if you want to try it  noelle is there some kind

happen again im so sorry /tavern/  krystina and they say were savages  marisha its a pretty slow night in the sunset stride you see a few people at a twoseater in  the corner you see another group at a booth over here a few people playing poker and behind the  bar is a woman named miss honey penny shes dressed like a typical barmaid shes got shelf  boob going on shes trying to go for those tips shes got a nice darker complexion with rich  brunette hair that she has piled up in a big messy bun on the top /tavern/ of her head to get it out of her  face she looks over at you guys has that look of awareness and goes a round on the bar and  starts pouring up shots everyone goes woo  mary i sneak around the outskirts of the bar while everyone is distracted looking on the bar  marisha okay youre going to go around towards the back  mary yeah  marisha cool you slip out you go around you see a cellar stockroom and there is a little  small cramped back door entryway right as you go to /none/ open it she comes over and cracks the door  mary hi honey  laura penny  noelle oh hey there honey penny fancy seeing you here yeah its been a while  marisha it has  laura what does penny look like i mean never mind is she human or is she a bear  marisha she is human but you know that she shares similar talents to you depending on  certain full moons and moisture in the air  dani theres a mystery here and im here for it  marisha weve bonded in the past over /none/ her  dani is that what they call it  noelle it is what they call it actually  marisha thats what we call it  noelle thank you for asking it went very well  dani good  mary you and her or you and her or you and you  noelle all of us  krystina you and who else tova  noelle yeah well you know what  marisha come inside she ushers you all inside youre all sitting around cases of wine and  theres a few standing kegs and wine barrels that you all prop /town/ yourself up on im assuming you  guys are in town because of the balootonium problem  mary yep  noelle thats right what have you seen  marisha well i mean see things every night here in stilben but there has been one guy thats  been calling attention to everybody in town he goes by the name of crispin glover  laughter  noelle i dont like the sound of him  brittany oh he sounds real spooky  krystina is he a tall fellow  dani is he very thin  marisha very tall very thin hes /tavern/ got this greasy slicked back black hair  brittany would you say that hes a clownyclown clown  marisha a little goofy a little weird he seems really convinced on letting people know hes  crispin glover i think he thinks were supposed to know who he is  mary is it our density to find him  dani yes i was waiting for it  marisha i think hes behind a lot of this he seemed like just another whacko that stumbled in  the bar and then one night after a few drinks he started rambling about some /none/ pack of bears that was  harassing him  noelle dont know anything about that  mary but he is human right  marisha he is a human he is wearing  mary does he have any of these other properties to make him not look human  marisha not that im aware of i mean he wears this really weird black suit this blackonblack  suit all that time its like hes always in black suits  mary thats very johnny cash  brittany is he alone when he comes in is he alone or is he with a /tavern/ posse  marisha he tends to be alone although ive seen him look over his shoulder thinking that maybe  hes been followed i honestly didnt think anything of it  krystina whats the general response in the bar  marisha similar disease and discomfort  krystina but is every girl in the bar crazy about this sharp dressed man  marisha they seemed to be driven crazy by his mysterious presence not because i think they find  him attractive but because they want to know genuinely why he keeps telling them that hes  crispin glover  noelle /none/ i think if anyone has a shot with him its this bear in a fancy hat  brittany whats his favorite drink to order  marisha he always orders whiskey  mary does he have a specific aroma  marisha hmm like very expensive cologne that ive never smelled before  dani does it smell nice or does it smell bad  marisha it smells chemicaly its nothing ive really ever smelled before  krystina does it smell as if it is more of a body spray than a cologne  marisha hmm if i knew what aerosols were i /none/ would think that there might be some of this in  that yeah  noelle now penny have you been around balootonium before up close i mean  marisha i think i have but i have been unaware  noelle would you be able to compare this scent of balootonium to the scent of this mans cologne  laura you are so smart she is so smart  dani she is the brains  marisha that is actually an interesting point that i never thought about before he did have a  strange odor but if he had balootonium on /none/ him at the time i was unaware but yeah now that you  mention it id say its highly likely  noelle do you have any idea where we can find this fellow  marisha yeah hes been spending a lot of times at the docks he has this strange looking boat it  looks very hightech a lot of steam and copperpowered motors that ive never really seen  hes been prepping it for the last few days i dont know where hes going but  brittany where is it docked  laura and marisha at the docks  /none/ brittany is it outside is it nearby  marisha it is nearby honestly i could probably stick my head out of this window and throw a penny  and hit it youre pretty close  dani do you have a lot of pennies penny  marisha i do have a lot of pennies how did you know  dani it was a total guess  marisha does she do this what is it that she does  noelle we think her eyes they gaze right into your soul she just knows things  laura then slightly to the side of /none/ your soul as well  noelle but if you ask her for a berry she always has a berry  mary does the boat have a name  marisha not that im aware of i dont know hes been rambling about this pack of bears so as  soon as i heard that i thought it was potentially linked to the bear acuda he might be an informant  of hattori bongos im not sure that was my first thought he seems like he got caught up in  something that he didnt necessarily understand and now hes stuck in /none/ a crappy situation  laura did you already say what color the boat is  mary it was coppery right  marisha its got coppery implements on it  laura is it also kind of a penis color  marisha its not a penis color no but it looks like it was a steel that they tried to paint but  it didnt necessarily take it seems like its been on the water a little bit  dani why would you choose penis color though if youre going to paint something why not white  marisha i dont know  /none/ dani its weird  mary some people like that color  noelle cant relate lets go find the boat  mary lets go find a boat  brittany penny thank you so much  marisha thank you guys good luck  mary hey pen do you have any honey mead  marisha its good asking she does  excited exclamations  marisha if you figured it out she pours a little glass for each of you  noelle can always count on you for the honey mead honey penny  marisha you know i get it stocked  noelle youre /none/ the best around i dont know why i was miming having a cup when i have a cup  brittany im going to offer you my daddys

laura mmhmm  krystina i apologize im on a bit of a honey diet at the moment  brittany oh i understand its all right  mary okay penny is there anything else you can tell us  marisha sighs if you get into trouble you know /tavern/ where to find me  dani here  marisha yeah here  dani yes  noelle good guess  marisha until the bar closes  dani im really good at this  brittany what time is it now  marisha probably six oclock by now  brittany the sun might be going down now okay  mary seeing as were not the most inconspicuous at the moment is there a back alley that you  might direct us to  marisha there is ill let you out this back way if you hang a right follow the trash line  /none/ itll pop you right back out the back way where the sewers go  mary ooh sewers do you have any old tablecloths or bags we can cover this ol fur for us just a  little bit  marisha got a few empty burlap sacks  mary burlap sacks  marisha mmhmm  dani i dont want to wear a sack  noelle i know why would you hide this figure with a sack  mary i understand that but sometimes we need to be incognito yo  noelle weve got our hats  laura do humans wear burlap /none/ sacks a lot  marisha beggars do i think  dani i dont want to be a beggar though  brittany well blend in  marisha well here i was going to throw it away anyway  mary ill put it over my shoulder in case we need it  noelle all right  dani maybe if we need to tie somebody up and put them in the sack that would be cool  mary how many sacks have i gotten two three one  marisha hmm huh  mary how many sacks did i just get  marisha she /none/ handed you two well say two sacks two leftover grain sacks  dani hey penny this is a weird question but i  marisha from you no  dani actually its probably a pretty normal question for me now that i think about it do you  have any rope  marisha i dont think i do im sorry  laura i cannot get this fudge off these gloves  brittany sorry they are a little sticky  marisha she throws her barmaids wipeything  noelle oh no its dissolving the gloves  krystina everyone knows gloves arent for eating /none/ theyre for keeping your bear paws off of things  or to leave a print  marisha you must be the hacker  krystina i am actually  marisha i used to do that a little bit back in my days at the high bear nation i miss it  krystina well you know its just like beardapest all over again  groaning  marisha good days good days  krystina i tell you it takes me back it really does they wouldnt understand beardapest  noelle ah shes always going on about beardapest  mary you dropped that name /none/ on the floor there might want to pick that up  krystina oh im sorry did you not have time in beardapest  mary no you dropped it again you might want to pick that up again  krystina you know what else i dropped there lots of memories and time that ill never regain  mary aww thats okay maybe we can knock it back into you  krystina maybe i can explain to you all the things that your car does that you dont quite  know about yet  mary that would be very exciting if you /none/ did that would probably help the whole crew and our entire  mission if you want to take this outside ive got no problem with  noelle all right girls girls  krystina would you like to bring it down to bear paws because ive got fisticuffs aplenty  noelle put your bear paws away we are on the hunt for crispin glover  krystina

how we ended up on the same team  mary chuckles i think you and i are bookending it just to keep them in line  brittany theres a boat outside do we want to wait until more nightfall do humans go to bed at  certain /dung/ times  noelle i think we shouldnt let it get too late i guess were bears so we can see pretty well in  the dark  marisha yeah youll do okay youre fine  laura it is harder to see shapes at dusk  noelle i really thought we were pulling it off there was that one guy but  dani everyone else seemed to be totally fine with us  noelle i think were doing a good job  laura do you have any tips to make us look more human  marisha honestly i feel like the /town/ more human you look in this town the weirder youre going to  stand out theres some weird people who come through here just act like a crazy homeless guy  and no one will pay any attention  noelle maybe we should have taken more burlap sacks  mary thats all right weve got three  laura bear growling  noelle that was good  laura i was trying to say hello did it work  noelle it did it was great  marisha it was pretty good actually  mary do we need to go through the sewers /none/ or can we turn right and head straight down to the docks  marisha no youll see a gutter follow the gutter full of shit  mary that we can do  marisha dumps right into the ocean  mary ive done that many times in my life and i have no problem with it whatsoever  marisha thats why you make a damn good agent  dani because shes okay with shit  mary no because i know how to follow shit to get to the good stuff  laura to the boats  marisha

honey penny lets you out she leans does a doubletake makes sure that the coast is clear  and lets you all slip out in the /town/ back alley you do find a shit gutter where everyone is dumping  from their buildings sliding out yeah very medieval a lot of falling poo it seems to do  this downhill grade and pops out right behind the docks  noelle lets go follow the shit get to the good stuff  brittany hold your nose  dani we smell so well because were bears  noelle yeah but bears theyre used to shit shit in the woods theres lots of shit in the woods  brittany how many boats are in this dock  marisha theres probably /none/ about half a dozen boats right now theres a couple that are up close it  looks like fishermen coming back unloading their supplies  mary fish theres fish  marisha yes there are fish  mary thats good to know  marisha theres a couple boats that look inactive like theyve been there for a little bit  and no ones really used them theres one boat that looks a little bit more welltodo like its  more of a socializing and luxury boat than a utility boat and then you do see one other boat  that has /none/ the copper detailing and pipes coming out the back of it its a little bit tinier its got  a pointed front its different than a boat youve ever really seen before  mary which boat is right next to el coppero  marisha the copper one is actually separated and off at the very end  noelle is there any cover nearby crates or shipping containers  marisha there are theres a lot of shipping containers scattered all along  noelle i say we sneak close and we hide behind the crates and try and get a closer look /none/ maybe  you can use your special goggles glasses shades  brittany were standing by some crates right i first look at the crates because i want to thieve  these crates whats inside the crates  marisha the first crate you see once again a lot of grains a lot of fruits looks like it was  a general food supply thats been coming from not a lot of fruits that you recognize a little  bit more exotic tropical fruits  brittany weird tropical fruits i dont know what that is i look at one more crate next /none/ to it  marisha the other one looks like it has a lot of a sulfuric you actually are familiar with this  because you have seen it before based on being in the high bear nation it is gunpowder  brittany oh my goodness well i want to break right into that  marisha okay roll for bear oh wait no youre the thief sorry roll for thief twice roll  twice take the lowest  brittany for criminal or bear  marisha for criminal yes  mary come on clairbear

give a fuck  marisha you hear a little bit of a crack and the wood does not move and your partners think  dani are you trying to punch something do you need help  marisha they look a little distressed  brittany now i look at the boat  dani do you want me to punch that for you because im real good at it  /none/ krystina have you ever realized the actual size of your paws  dani i saw her punch something and now i want to punch it can i try  marisha you can try roll twice take the lowest  brittany theres totally gunpowder in this barrel  noelle well i assume we have our own  dani i also failed  marisha oh the rest of you you first see clair do it and then you see drew seemingly trying to  follow the person before her also punch and crack the shit out of your knuckles  unfortunately youre /none/ starting to get a little frustrated at this so if each of you will move  one point from criminal to bear  mary how heavy is this crate  marisha pretty heavy  noelle were not looking at the crate necessarily were looking at the boat were  hiding being the crate  brittany i look to the boat to see if theres anybody inside the boat  marisha you dont see anybody inside but you do see through the boat a complex steam engine  contraption it looks a little similar to what you have and you also /none/ see one small mediumsized  crate shoeboxsized crate and a few other satchels

see hoomans or other such creatures  marisha you dont see anybody yet but at this point when you are looking at the boat tova  your globear positioning system slow beeping as you look at it you see a little red tracker that  /dung/ is moving across the screen and towards the docks towards the boat that you are looking at  laura gasps type in crispin glover and see if it goes to him  noelle does it work  marisha it does sure enough as you type in crispin glover and it goes fast beeping you  look through the crates and you see a tall thin man in a dark black suit pass through the crates  hes carrying another satchel and looking a little hasty through the gap in the crates hes not  moving physically through the crates he /none/ is not incorporeal he just passes by them  noelle youve always got to watch out for ghosts  dani ghost crispin glover sounds like a lot  noelle i feel like thats what he was born for to be a ghost  brittany he has a satchel  marisha he has a little satchel and he

button on the dashboard thats all now what hes still  fighting clair after he pushed the button  dani what are we going to do  mary /none/ has the boat started to decelerate at all now that he is totally distracted  marisha it is he has pretty much come to a complete stop  mary then i am going to continue to block his forward motion i am going to go like that  marisha okay he is completely

shoebox crate what is it whats inside  marisha in the satchel is a bunch of random knick knacks that look like hes picked up trash off of  the street  brittany crispin glover  marisha yeah just super weird there is a folded note and another black suit its almost a bugout bag  brittany i reach inside the /none/ satchel and i pull out the note with my bear eyes i try to read it  marisha okay  dani

ingredients on the sides of boxes  brittany yes i do i am super safe certified  marisha from that knowledge what you glean this letter looks like scrawlings from a madman looks  like there were coordinates /none/ and algorithms and equations that look like he was trying to figure  something out as you turn a page you see a diary entry and it talked about him being an  interdimensional being  gasping  mary what the hell  marisha then he says this happens to me all the time i get sucked into weird realms and people  keep saying im an actor and no one wants to listen to me when i say im stuck in a creative  landscape they think im some sort of weird creative genius im not with any side /none/ i just  want to get out of this fantasy realm get me out im just trying to avoid the bears it goes on  and it talked about more ramblings about how hes being stalked by bears then he says he cant  believe that there would be such a dextrous group of bears known as the high bear nation  dani thats us  marisha and that they promised him some balootonium and said that if properly used it  could get him back to his home realm he is  dani wait so hes working for the /none/ high bear nation but thats us  krystina maybe weve been conned  brittany what have we done  dani bearsley  mary bearsley would not do that  dani you dont know do you  noelle youre letting your heart blind you to the truth  mary its not my heart its my loins but even so  noelle well same deal  krystina you mean to tell me you dont understand whats happening here weve been doublecrossed  and were the doublecrossers  laura is the balootonium in the shoebox  brittany i look in the shoebox  /none/ marisha there is balootonium in the shoebox  brittany theres balootonium in the shoebox ladies i dont know how to take this  dani highpitched are we the baddies  laura are people still shooting at us  marisha you are still heading deep into the ocean and there are still boats as you guys are  all having this sudden crisis of morality and realization  laura who is it that is chasing us then is it us or is it them  marisha you can see as you look  noelle lets shoot first ask questions later  /none/ dani always a good plan  marisha you cant see much features but they do appear to be two beartype individuals in very  nice black suits  mary well shit hey bearah did you see any underwater aquatic feature to this particular vehicle  krystina darling weve got all the features you need you just tell me what you need to go  mary submarine mama can we go underwater  krystina lets take this sucker down  mary come on  marisha beeping youve already seen this a pod a clear glass bubble comes up over top of /none/  your convertible top submersion sounds you go underwater  noelle were in deep now girls  marisha a little thing pops up on the console and says five minutes of oxygen remaining  noelle oh well thats  dani thats helpful  mary everybody calm down stop it doublem no calm  laura hyperventilating im claustrophobic  mary its okay  noelle were all right  dani oh i hate timers  marisha five minutes of oxygen  mary five minutes how deep are we at this point  marisha not too deep if you look up you can /none/ still see a little bit of daylight  noelle what if we double around  mary i bet we should double back around the boats and go back  brittany they will never see our penis car coming never  mary they wont  krystina if we turn up the hyperdrive on this boat we can get out the other side the only  question i have is could i possibly hack it in for more air  mary give it a shot mama in the meantime i turn around and i start heading toward shore  dani is there /none/ another dock did we know is it just one dock or is it a peninsula area  marisha make a criminal check as you look around  mary is there a beach  marisha there was a beach  dani two sorry i got really excited  marisha drew you press your polar bear face against and being a polar bear you are very  adept at seeing underwater as grizz is turning around and you look out the front towards the  direction you guys were actually heading you see some scaffolding poles like a structure is  actually /none/ not too far ahead of you all  dani go for the structure poles thingy i think we can maybe hide there and maybe get back up  above water and have air dont worry maven were going to get air  mary just keep breathing maven baby well slowly slowly i want to take this  marisha grizz you turn and slowly start youre not trying to disturb the water and let  your presence known as you get closer you do see  dani i start rubbing mavens shoulders  marisha these support beams start making themselves a /none/ little bit more clear and as you get  closer beepbeep beepbeep the gps system has more little tracking dots pop up and it looks  like its coming from this structure  mary okay  laura type in bad guys and see if it is them  krystina yes  dani it just comes up bad guys  krystina youd be surprised theres not very many identifiers for bad guys grizz can we take  her up  mary we can take her up my fear is that we come up right into a nest of wasps  noelle /none/ well weve got less than a minute left of air i think we need more information somebody  has set us up  mary i agree  noelle someone in the high bear nation sent us here to make us patsies  dani we need to go up we need to get air  mary were not that far beneath the surface were about 20 feet down were fine as i slowly  start to rise so we dont disturb the surface  marisha very slowly start to ascend as you get closer you let the little bubble crest a /none/ little  bit but youre not coming all the way up as you look up you all see cresting the waterline the  top of this building it is a giant industrial complex it is an offshore military base and  weapons laboratory and at the top you see a big sign marking the entire building that simply says ripley  mary does the penis have a condom andor cloaking device  marisha it doesnt but that is something we should totally submit to the high bear nation to  have implemented  mary ill write it down for bearsley /none/  marisha and that is where were going to take a break  dani wait did we get air  marisha you pop it open a little bit and you get air yeah youre fine youre fine you dont die  noelle thank god  mary you all right there darling  dani we come back

i will know that  krystina if i were to step into this from where i am right now into this current memory bubble  floating about my head id say youre all crazy weve been betrayed  noelle i would yell down from the future what do you mean  krystina i would say well it doesnt quite translate into what im trying to say so  growling  mary you /none/ have a lovely singing voice if i might say  krystina you know youre welcome  mary before we get out has the memory bubble passed  noelle are we still i want to remember having a nice whiskey while were here  marisha you feel the scent of the alcohol burning your nostrils  noelle this is a nice memory i like this one a bunch of standup gals  marisha cold sweat of the glass  dani money honey honey penny  noelle laughing money honey is a completely different person  marisha glass was slippery speaking of /none/ the sweat on the glass  dani honey penny was great that was all i was going to say its fine moving on  noelle she is great isnt she  dani she was great she was kind of hot too  noelle oh our memory thought bubble is going away its been an honor  marisha reminiscing on these wonderful thoughts you calm your minds youre reminded of the  mission that youre on its importance and that it doesnt matter who sent you on this mission it  is what you do during the mission that defines the /none/ mission  dani thanks vin diesel  marisha thank you you can all choose if you would like to move a point from bear into  criminal because of that flashback  mary if were evensteven were fine though right  noelle im going to eat a honey  marisha youre missing a point  laura no you want to move a bear into criminal  noelle am i  laura yeah youre good move it to where theyre even  mary you want to move your criminal back into bear  noelle yeah but is that what were doing /none/ is the flashback gets criminal back to bear okay cool  thats what i wanted  brittany after this memory has faded were sort of under the compound in the compound  marisha youre underneath and you can see its on stilts above the ocean and you look up and  its pretty much industrial riveted steel flooring that you see looks pretty practical you  do see a hatch not far that appears to be locked  mary before we go anywhere could we get an idea of where the pingpingbongbong bad guys are one  of your little /none/ blips the bad blips  krystina you know the last time i typed in bad guys something came up great so lets type in  villains  brittany ooh more direct  marisha beeping  krystina oh look a clue  brittany how many do you see  marisha you cant really tell its this cluster right over top of you  mary fuck theres a cluster  krystina a clusterfuck if you will  noelle are we the villains  dani are we the baddies  mary wait a minute where is that location  noelle lets not worry /none/ about that  dani i think it just means that theyre right above us because were underneath that stilts thing  laura type in us and see if it beeps the same way  marisha you type in clair mcfuzz and it goes beeping and points over at her  laura is it in the same place as the other blips  marisha pretty much in the same place but it singles out one of the blips  noelle are we the villains what has happened  dani i still really think its just because theyre literally right above us /none/ but thats okay guys  noelle theyre clustered in a group directly above us we got to get up there  krystina would it be possible to type in someone else  marisha you can try yeah  mary put in bearsley  dani its a bear positioning system though i think were reading too much into this  krystina bearsley  noelle we are asking this device to tell us if we are good or not i dont understand whats hard to understand  marisha beeping  dani gasps bearsleys right above us  marisha it is in the /none/ cluster a little bit away and in a corner  noelle bearsleys the villain  mary we dont know that yet  krystina ladies i dont believe that its us i do believe that weve officially been  doublecrossed  laura do any of us have a saw  mary we have a gun we got three guns and a magic bullet  brittany i can see through walls  laura oh put on the glasses and see if theres people above us  brittany okay i put on my hat and glasses and i look up straight  marisha /none/ you see two water portways that are a little bit open it looks like the floor can  basically move and be sectioned out and make space for boats to come in and park  brittany ladies i see two waterways that can make space for our penis contraption boat  marisha you see a ton of crates looks like general stock and supply you see one guard one  bear in a suit  brittany a bear in a suit  marisha standing near the edge of the wall a door that he is guarding  dani i think /none/ i can punch that guy  noelle which one of you can pick a lock can you pick a lock  dani she could pick the lock and i could punch him  noelle i think that we should pick a lock and we should go up there and we should punch him because  were a bunch of goddamn bears and thats what we do  dani this is a really good idea i like this plan and weve been doublecrossed  noelle weve been doublecrossed  mary so whats the plan what do we do  noelle we /none/ punch the villains go up to bearsley and punch him  mary wait a minute heres the thing if we just go in there and start accusing youre going to  blah blah blah then other people might say well youre blah blah and theyll kill us  maybe we need to keep our cover of doing what bearsley wants until we actually determine whether  or not hes a fucking villain  brittany im with grizz  mary then we turn on them and eat them all  brittany im double with grizz  noelle i hate a liar /none/ i just want to punch him so bad  mary what are you thinking double m  laura so were not going to kill this guard  noelle we will kill him  mary that goes without saying when we get up if we do find do we give him the balootonium what  do we do we need to just not run in and jaccuse i think thats french  noelle but he already knows that we blew up his people right  mary all we know is that we followed crispin glover and fucking got what we were /none/ supposed to  get thats all he knows that we know  dani i dont think that this thing is actually telling us whether or not somebody is a villain i  just think theyre telling us theres somebody there  brittany i go up to the lock and try to pick to lock on the hatch roll for criminal  marisha you scutter up and you use the halfdome thats still there from when its in salmon  submarine mode right on your tippytoes and you start trying to pick to lock roll twice roll for criminal  brittany /none/ yep see how this goes two or lower one  cheering  brittany finally  marisha while theyre bickering and theyre going back and forth you quietly get up there with your  comb and your fork that you found and a hatch opens up  brittany ladies not to be rude but lets get the fuck inside here i scurry up inside and wait  for them  mary follow the fudge girl still dont blow our cover dont blow that we know at this point when  we get up there we play dumb we play we have /none/ completed our mission okay  marisha clair you feel pretty good about that so you get to move a point from bear to criminal  mary no i meant if we see bearsley right now lets get rid of the guard and then head up  laura lets put a burlap sack over him and then punch him in the face  all ooh  noelle i like the way you think maven  dani gosh youre so great  marisha you all scutter up the side of this hatch door you have a few shipping crates and  containers /none/ that are blocking your way you all stealthily crawl up peak around the corner you  see a guard maybe ten feet facing away from you  brittany hes a bear in a suit  marisha he is a bear in a suit you guys are peaking around the corner hes facing sideways  brittany hes a bear in a suit who can be seduced by another bear perhaps  dani but burlap sacks  mary weve got to start with the seduction  laura what if i bring the sack over and i seduce him into putting it over /none/ his head  dani yeah  laura perfect plan  brittany bears are into that mmhmm  dani quick

okay all right /none/ focus lets keep going come on  marisha you go over to the door simple steel door but it does have a latch lock with a little  mechanical techy maybe enchanted key lock  brittany sounds like a hackers job  noelle should we look inside first with the goggles  brittany i put on my goggles and look inside the wall what do i see oh bm  marisha you see a long hallway that stretches down it looks like two stairs descending on  either side and it looks like another room adjacent to this doorway  /none/ brittany any creatures any people  marisha you see a couple of bears on the other side in the room that is adjacent to this one you  dont see anyone in the hallway  brittany are they bears in suits  marisha they are bears in suits you see two of them  brittany okay great okay ladies i see some bears in suits in some hallways and pathways and  such i think its worth going into i think its worth hacking into  noelle do you think you can do a number on this lock and get /none/ us in there  krystina huh pardon me can you tell me what this looks like a little more give me a little  detail on the system  marisha it looks like there is some sort of paw print indentation  noelle we got to get the guy out of the crate  mary im going to go get the guy from the crate  marisha it looks like theres also a latch that opens up and that you can enter a code if you  well this has a thing and you code if you cant do this /none/ you can override it with a code if that  makes sense you know those latchy things  dani sometimes those fingerprint things dont really work that well  marisha right so you can  mary if you go to clear and your fingerprints dont work you got to use your eyeballs  noelle wait you have that guys eyeball  dani you have crispin glovers eye  brittany i have crispin glovers eyeball i dont know if crispin glovers been cleared at this facility  marisha you know what amazingly you hold the eyeball in front of the scanner /none/  brittany its been dried to my fur because its bloody  marisha one side it looks like its trying it looks like he did have clearance but he was not  cleared for a single eye entry he needs both eyes  brittany so i go back just kidding all right i whisper to the eye ill see you later i put it  back in my satchel forgive me continue your hacking expertise  mary bearah its up to you because we can go back and get that guy in the crate  noelle we better hurry he /none/ might wake up soon  krystina listen i never go anywhere unprepared you see this  noelle i do  krystina you see this  noelle yeah ooh  krystina you ever heard of sound technology  noelle no  brittany tell us  krystina you probably havent because i just made it up  dani what that was a lot  krystina the thing about paw print scanners is the fact that they respond to sound but you have  to be very precise with it  marisha okay im into it  mary you going to smoke it /none/  krystina no darling im going to make the sounds each one of these is a singular code and  i have to do it as quickly as possible singing  noelle she sounds like an angel did it work  krystina i think it did  marisha roll twice take the lowest  krystina natural one  marisha natural one sure enough like magic tick kaboof the reverberations hum in the  indentations of the paw print  mary i just got to do this damn that was nice  marisha that was a successful plan you get to /none/ move a point from bear to criminal  krystina its hard out here for a bear pimp  marisha you peek around the door three heads on one side three on the other looking down  hallways and you see those stairways that clair saw through the glasses and another door directly  across the way this one does not appear to be locked but you do know that there two guards on  the other side  noelle all right should  laura wheres bearsley  noelle how many bears are in that room  brittany i think i /none/ saw two i think i saw two bears i wasnt sure if they were in the same room  or on opposite sides  noelle bearah can you tell us if bearsley is in that room  krystina from what i see bearsleys behind the wall  marisha you see that he is in a corner but appears behind you you cant necessarily tell  since the gps is a birdseye view what level he is on but he does not appear to be in the room in  front of you  dani so maybe we should go upstairs /none/  noelle we should head down one of these staircases  krystina we should all be on alert  brittany we have to be very quiet  noelle should we split up  mary never split the group  dani i think thats a really bad idea actually i think thats a great idea definitely split the party  brittany tovas got good ideas yall i mean  noelle we dont have to do that  laura you are the brains you tell us what to do  noelle lets choose one so at least we  dani i think /none/ thats a great idea  noelle well now im not confident about it at all  krystina i believe that as the brains you ought to take those two  noelle can i use my brains to figure out which staircase is most likely to lead to bearsley  marisha you can roll for brains  noelle oh  marisha yeah absolutely just peeking up and around the staircase to your right you can see  that it looks like its a dead end there is another room this side and this side but there  doesnt appear to be /none/ a hallway that goes further when you peek around the stairs to the left it  keeps going and loops around  noelle all right lets go this way weve got to find bearsley we got to get the truth out of him  whatever it takes lets go  brittany all right  marisha okay you head up the stairs and you go around the corner as you head up there is a  glass door with glass windowing that looks like it opens up into a very large laboratory room there  does appear to be a locked /none/ vault door directly to your left like a locked storage room or a  locked you know how banks will have a locked information type of situ yeah off to the side  brittany so its glass  marisha one glass door with glass windows and you can see  brittany are there people inside can they see us as much as we can see them  marisha there does not appear to be anybody inside when you look at your globear positioning  system you do see one flashing beacon from deep inside he looks to be in the /dung/ big laboratory room  dani is it bearsley or is it just a dude  mary its all glass we cant see him from where we are  marisha its dark you can see it looks like half the lights are on towards the front of the room  but the room goes pretty far back and falls in shadow and you cant see past it  noelle is he the only one in the room  marisha you only see one beacon in the room yes  mary is this beacon a bear beacon  marisha you assume so /none/  noelle i think we should go in  laura what about the vault  brittany theres a locked vault so is there a door in which to get into the lab or is the vault  for the lab  marisha there is a door to get into the lab like once again those clear glass hospital  doors almost  brittany but not locked  marisha it has a simple lock on it similar to what you guys have already discovered since youve  already hacked the one downstairs you already know the code to get into this /none/ one so this one has  already been unlocked  mary can i inspect the laboratory equipment to see what exactly are they working on something  chemical are they working on  marisha yeah youre going to peek through the glass  mary yeah  marisha roll for criminal just once  mary oh i see nothing  noelle can i use my bear snoot  mary my panting  marisha your bear breath is fogging youre like guys i think they have a fogging system  you dont know  mary seems kind of foggy in there  /none/ noelle can i use my bear sense of smell to smell if i smell the familiar scent that i would know  from crispin glover of balootonium  marisha you can roll for bear  noelle two  marisha you do catch faint wafts of this highly radioactive honey compound thats a little sweet  but a little it burns your nostrils  noelle can i tell which direction its wafting from  marisha you can just tell its coming from the lab  noelle its probably in that vault  krystina you know i can sense honey darlin  /none/ noelle what  krystina yes  noelle well  dani is balootonium honey or is it something else  marisha technically a condensed crystallized form of honey thats highly explosive yes you  also confirm that you can sense a strong amount of balootonium coming from the laboratory  brittany i put on my glasses and i look in the vault like i should have 20 minutes ago what can  i see  marisha you see documents high priority files a few more weapons  noelle we got to get those  marisha you see sitting on one of /none/ the shelves something that looks useful  brittany i dont know what i see but my gut says we need to go through that vault door  dani does it look really useful  brittany looks really useful yes  laura open it use your lockpicking skills  brittany all right  mary should we go into the laboratory  laura after  mary so the vault is outside the lab  marisha yes  noelle should some of us try and find bearsley and subdue him i mean we wont be far well all  be in the same /none/ room  laura no no go to the vault first  mary vault first if there are weapons in that vault we all might need a weapon because we all  know how good bearsley is with a weapon  noelle then we need to be really quiet  krystina i believe it might be a good time to make sure all of our loyalties are aligned whos  here with the high bear nation and siding with bosley or bearsley if hes not on our side and  whos with us  mary dont you look at me momma /none/ you know im loyal to no one but myself but if someone betrays  me i dont care how hot their salmon car is if you know what im saying  brittany im with grizz  mary i know you do look at that face  dani i mean i sleep at the high bear nation but you know i mean i could probably find somewhere  else to sleep at some point itll be fine i might be homeless now but its fine dont worry  about it its cool  noelle look if the high bear nation is /none/ lying to me theyre going down i mean to take them down  this has been my everything if bearsley is crooked hes about to become a lot more crooked  because  brittany you will crook him  dani i will punch him for you if you need me to  noelle i will  brittany grizz we understand where you come from we get it  mary look ladies i dont know what the hells happening down there or up there or anywhere at  this point all i know is that i swore an oath if that /none/ oath is broken by the people i swore it to  theres nothing that i wont do to make sure that that oathbreaking will be never broken again with  any oath that will ever happen in an oathtime know what im saying  brittany i do  noelle i think i follow  laura i mostly understood  dani i did not get any of that  krystina that was a powerful statement  brittany paws in for the honey  marisha its a little less awkward than the first time yeah  mary lets make a pact to /none/ each other all right we get out of this alive and then we figure out  where we go all right  noelle its a good pact i like its straight forward its simple works for me  krystina if we die we die then we die together  dani i dont really want to die literally  noelle lets make a pact we dont die we win we get the thing and we go thats our pact no  one is going to die  krystina but if we do we carry on because no one ever dies  /none/ dani why are you talking about dying  noelle lets make another pact lets open the door and go inside  marisha the leader has spoken  laura lets go to the vault  marisha clair you walk up to the vault  brittany im like im going to thieve this nonsense  marisha you see an oldfashioned combination lock in front of you  brittany oldfashioned combination lock  noelle eight six seven five three oh nine  brittany how many dice do i roll against this lock  marisha you roll two dice  brittany all right three /none/ or less  marisha yeah  brittany come on daddy three  marisha okay it takes a little bit but you put your ear up to it your keen honey badger hearing  hears the clicks and the tumblers as you turn it over click it is unlocked you go to turn the  wheel youre too weak  dani i come up behind her  noelle is this the vault or is this the lab  marisha this is the vault  brittany my tiny badger hands are too small please  dani i lift her up and i /none/ put her on my shoulders  brittany can i pout just a little bit but im happy its happening  dani youre doing great youre doing so great i grunting  marisha roll for muscle  mary come on mama  dani two  marisha door opening your polar bear biceps turn it with ease and then you push but it still  might be a team effort you all grunting all your little bear paws skitter against the steel  floor but it opens  sighing  marisha you are all in you are all successful  noelle im /none/ going for that useful thing  marisha all right  mary im going to look for the weapon  brittany i look for the interesting thing tova should do that  marisha tova you immediately go and you find  noelle the bomb defusal manual  laura oh thats good very useful  noelle i cant imagine why we would need such a thing but  marisha grizz leigh you see a small crate got padding in it its got three little eggshaped  pods in it  mary yes you know i love them well thats another story for /dung/ another time these are fireball  grenades  dani what  mary mmhmm oh heck yes  brittany well ive got a gun so im good  marisha bearah your sun bear keen honeyscent spotting nose looks down and finds a small vial  filled with honey although it is a dark blackish purplish ichorlike color  krystina rare black lotus honey that takes me back  mary whats that for  krystina it takes me back but i dont quite recall  dani ive had a lot of those nights its okay  marisha none of you are quite /none/ sure what it does  dani its most of my two days ago but dont worry about it  krystina but the name sounds amazing  mary okay what does the bomb manual thats a wonderful thing you hold onto that because it  sounds great  noelle its quite complicated it seems to be describing some bomb that is very difficult to  defuse these are the instructions if absolutely necessary lets hope not but i think that means  that theres probably a bomb nearby and that we should probably defuse it that is what i am  /none/ getting from this with my bear brains  brittany while they do that i make sure theres no one coming down the hallway and make sure no  ones following us so i keep a lookout im not the brains so im the lookout  dani im going to be near clair to be muscle in case something like that happens actually i want  to look and see there was a bunch of paperwork and all that like important documents  marisha mmhmm  dani i want to take a look at that and maybe see if we can /none/ figure out who betrayed us  marisha okay roll for criminal also all who participated which was i guess you two in  cracking the vault  brittany roll one for criminal  marisha i was going to say move a point from bear to criminal  dani im going to also eat some honey while i do this  marisha you move a point back yes sorry was going to say that earlier and then things got going  noelle didnt they give us honey  dani yeah we should all have three we should all have three honeys /none/  marisha so yeah if anyone wants to eat honey and move a point from criminal to bear you can  laura all right i will do that  marisha okay  dani okay im going to look at this paperwork oh no i did not i wouldve gotten it if i kept  that one but  marisha unfortunately you dont really know what youre looking at you pass it over to tova  noelle drew can you read  dani maybe not  noelle okay  marisha tova roll for brains with advantage  noelle yep  marisha /none/ you definitely succeed you look and you see blueprints inventory receipts  correspondence back and forth they all seem to be building some sort of weapon like a warhead  noelle like a bomb  marisha like a bomb and there have been a few iterations of it theyre testing it out you also  see blueprints for the 00 salmon  dani oh no  marisha as well as blueprints for crispin glovers boat as well as guns a few other things  noelle are there any names on any other these documents any messages from one bear to /none/ another  marisha there are a few sign off signatures that look like someone needed to give approval for some  of these shipments and they all seem to be under bearsley  dani oh no  noelle girls im afraid its what we thought bearsleys the rat the mole  mary i need to hear it from his mouth  laura what if paddington is ripley  noelle we need to find this warhead and we need to defuse it we also need to find bearsley and  get the goddamn truth out of him  dani maven no /none/  mary whats wrong what happened  laura nothing  krystina and noelle maven  laura i think i know who paddington is  mary who  dani weve never actually met paddington  laura what if paddington is ripley  mary oh shit balls  brittany explosion  dani this is so much bigger than ourselves  mary its all right  brittany what do we do  mary fucking take it down  noelle well bearsley is in this lab and presumably the warhead is too we should find  both of those things  mary well then /none/ lets go say hello to the man with the red bow tie  noelle bearah where is bearsley  krystina well you know it looks to me that he is  marisha and krystina beyond the wall towards the back of the room in the laboratory  laura what if you type in paddington  noelle can we do that  mary we can try  noelle i never thought of that before  marisha nothing coming up for paddington  laura what if you type in ripley  noelle is paddington real what if paddington is just bearsley using /none/ a funny microphone  marisha nothing coming up for ripley  brittany what if you type in shitty backstabber  marisha same place as bearsley  mary betrayal of everything we hold dear  noelle i mean look if bearsleys the only one whos ever seen paddington maybe theyre the same  person  dani maybe there is no paddington  noelle ive never seen bearsley in the same room as the speaker  krystina thats crazy talk its madness i tell you madness  dani i know crazy and i dont think thats crazy  noelle it has been /none/ my dream to meet sir paddington in the flesh and now i guess i got to  find another dream  krystina would it not be in the fur  noelle i dont know any more is he even a bear  dani yeah we dont even know  mary were jumping to a lot of conclusions  noelle and mary lets go find bearsley  brittany the hallways behind us  krystina lets jam our foots up a couple of asses  noelle i like that idea thats a good plan lets go be a bunch of goddamn bears /none/  laura i pull out my gun  noelle oh shit  brittany i also pull out my gun  noelle bears with guns  dani i pull out my fists  marisha youre all totally armed you exit the vault you peek around the little pocket hallway  that its in and there right before you to your left is the door to the laboratory it is already  unlocked because you already hacked the system you all can go right in  laura should we charge in screaming  dani nah i think we need to be classy /none/  noelle yeah i think we should walk in real cool and have like a line that we say say it looks  like this honey pot is cracked or something like that im workshopping it  laura no you should stick with that  mary i think you should try it  laura here we go  noelle im sorry grizz im sorry  mary my heart is kind of broken but my heart needs to find answers i say we walk in calmly as  a united front and see what that son of a bitch has to /none/ say before i rip his face off  dani we could do both  krystina stomp a mud hole for grizz  laura lets go  noelle you know what they say bears before bros  all bears before bros  mary bears before fucking bros yall okay lets go  brittany we walk in like this  marisha you all push on the door  laura walk in slow motion  marisha intones battle without honor or humanity you flip your hair you have a nice  flyingv formation grizz tova  laura tova say the line  noelle /none/ looks like this honey pot is cracked  brittany oh that was good sorry  mary i liked that  marisha the midnight maven clair mcfuzz drew bearymoore and bearah pawcett you see before you  a vast open room few consoles on the side walls flashing lights leds creating a dimly lit glow in  a stark interior alone in the center of the room you see a platform suspended from the ceiling by  thick industrial cables on this platform you see a semitranslucent cylindrical device emanating a  faint glow of its own with a mess of /dung/ wiring protruding from its center as you peek a little  closer your eyes adjust to the darkness you see through its translucent body pulsating marbles of  sheer energy this is a metric fuck ton of balootonium and it is rigged to blow  dani oh no  mary is there a timer on it  marisha you see a little screen but it appears to be dark you see a small light just blue  nothing much to it at the moment  noelle so its rigged to blow but its not necessarily active  dani is bearsley /none/ in the room  marisha take a moment  noelle should we find him  marisha you look down your globear positioning system is the only sound in the room the  beeping emerging from the shadows once again is bearsley but this time he is in a giant mech suit  dani no  mary fuck this shit  marisha with a strap across it  mary hes got a strap on  marisha engraved in steel lettering says the ripley p5000 he says  mary thats a lot of pee  marisha thats a lot of pee he /none/ says hello honeys surprised to see me  laura how could you do this  dani we were surprised like 20 minutes ago when we found our you were betraying us but this is a lot  marisha yeah you know i thought you guys might figure it out  mary you did  noelle what was your plan exactly were we your patsies that you were going to stick this all on  marisha no i just wanted you all to realize how much i do around here and how underappreciated i  have been for years  mary /none/ oh for fucks sake this is about your fucking ego seriously  laura we compliment you all the time  brittany i am not about to be bearsplained right now  krystina this is the most attentiongrabbing thing ive ever seen in my doggone life  mary are you that fucking fragile is that why you wear a bow tie  krystina who are you  marisha i thought you guys would be more intimidated by this all right look i have been  a puppet for paddington for years im basically his glorified assistant im the brains of the /none/  entire operation and what do i get its just hello bearsley hi bearsley see you later  bearsley while we go on an amazing adventure it should be me running this organization  krystina well maybe next time you should book yourself a trip  marisha i did  dani you are though you are running the organization i dont understand your logic like  at all  marisha its all under paddington and he will never appreciate me thats why i started  developing the balootonium using the laboratory funds and dispersing it across the entire continent  /none/ dani thats why were not getting paid  laura if you ask me thats pretty shitty  noelle so why do you want to build a bomb  dani are you that sad  marisha i want you all to come and work for me  krystina couldnt you have just asked  dani and mary we have been working for you  marisha i want the organization not under paddington it belongs to me  mary have you ever met paddington  marisha yeah a couple times  noelle whats he like  marisha i cant tell you that /none/  krystina youre telling me you couldnt have called a meeting to ask us to work for you  dani youre in a mechanical thing but you still have loyalty to paddington to where youre not  going to even tell us what he looks like  marisha im sorry im under a contract and i deeply respect contracts  dani fucking ndas  marisha its the only thing that i really hold of value  laura type in asshole and see what comes up  dani i bet its going to pop up on him  krystina well what /town/ do you know ive got an asshole detecting one in my presence  marisha look you guys dont know what its been like okay and i know the source to all the  balootonium and how much balootonium is out there  dani yes as a bunch of lady bears we have no idea what its like to be underappreciated  mary cry me a fucking river motherfucker seriously  krystina you picked the wrong crowd  marisha you know this felt like every other bad guy situation in every other story so i thought  it would hold different /none/  mary howd that work out for them  marisha well  noelle bearsley can we drop the act why dont you take that suit of armor off and do something  that makes sense like apply for another job or ask us to join your organization  dani why dont you just talk to paddington  mary or start your own agency if thats what you want  krystina why dont you just offer us more pay  marisha youre all confusing me this is what im talking about he goes boop and hits a button  laura oh /none/ no  dani testosterone  marisha he hits another button on his mech suit and he goes figure this out and then well see  whos the smartest honeys he jet packs through a trapdoor in the roof and then  noelle someone grab him  laura shoot at him  brittany wait for it wait for it its coming  laura oh no  brittany and then  laura is this going to be like marbles  yelling  dani no  noelle shit okay  mary oh my god i loved this game when i was a kid /none/  krystina it is male fragility  noelle im going to need all the brains here all right  dani theres a timer  brittany hes escaped  noelle the bomb will cease to function if it has 12 or more of its wires removed okay to make it  more difficult to hack the wiring is on a rotating circuit utilize the spinner to determine  which wire color is safe to remove for each balootonium marble that falls 30 seconds is  removed more than three marbles fall okay  dani just make choices  noelle red wires /none/ there are fewer red wires  laura so we got to pull a red one but be careful we cant oh good  marisha since you have a hacker in your group i will allow you one respin  laura oh thats good  noelle okay  marisha so you have to pull 12  dani i dont understand how this works  krystina i need you to pull slowly with the red wire  dani im only muscle  mary yes good  laura if more than three marbles fall  noelle there are fewer red ones so we /none/ cant okay oh god  laura wait  marisha if more than three marbles fall a 60 second timer starts  laura we have to pull 12 wires  noelle you spin ill pull  laura okay red thats good the red ones are the best ones to pull  brittany bottom  noelle oh god  laura red  brittany most bottom most bottom is  noelle thats not good red is not good  laura no red is good  noelle are you sure  mary red is good there are fewer reds in there  laura red /none/ again holy shit  noelle are there others on that side  krystina yes theres two on my side oh no theres one now  laura oh god  mary its done  laura were losing all of the base ones green  noelle okay were going high right  krystina go high  marisha six youre halfway there  krystina here  noelle where here  krystina yes  noelle you pull it  krystina im going to push it to you  noelle okay  brittany get it  noelle mines harder on this side i dont know /none/ about this  all ooh  laura that was a bad spin  marisha youre good  krystina mulligan  laura green  brittany low go for low  noelle there are none on the bottom thats  brittany lowest  dani the green isnt very low  laura okay thats good  marisha four more  laura four more yellow  dani theres a bunch of really low ones on yellow  mary this ones really low too  laura green  krystina where grizz leighs pointing thats the one yo  marisha which one grizz leigh  laura /none/ that one yes that one  marisha nice green  brittany were getting too confident were getting too cocky  krystina no that was okay  mary how many are left  marisha i think two more counting eleven twelve powering down it completely turns off i  cant believe that that actually  noelle oh man  brittany thats why youre the brains thats why youre the brains  dani yas queen  marisha matt and i playtested that ten times and it never went that well  brittany because your husbands an idiot  laughter  marisha you /none/ with a combined team  noelle that was really fun it was like pulling it out it was so cool  marisha thank you with a combined team effort you all manage to successfully defuse the bomb i  will allow you if you want to move a point from bear to criminal you can but you do not have to  because i remember so well  dani i was a lot of moral support for that so i will stay where i am  noelle my bear instincts that were leading the way on that one  marisha /none/ it was pretty good  noelle she just knew what to do  marisha it was pretty fucking amazing im not going to lie  mary well done  noelle that was amazing  dani what are we going to do about bearsley  noelle yeah hes gone  dani yeah  noelle should we search the lab and figure out  marisha he went through the roof in a jetpack power suit you guys do look up and the trap door  is still open maven with your climb ability you can see a pole that goes about halfway /none/ and you  could get a detachable ladder to drop about halfway down to climb up to the roof if you would like  noelle all right maven its up to you  laura should i try to climb up there  noelle yes please  laura all right ill give it a go  marisha you get advantage for your bear stat  mary bonne chance  laura a three that is a success  marisha absolutely you with no problem do that bear climb like up a tree  mary just this  marisha just like this  /none/ dani shes so impressive  mary there you go  marisha you manage to hold on and you reach over flip open a latch  laura come on now all of you beauties  marisha there is a ladder to the roof  noelle shes amazing what a woman climb up  marisha you guys all ascend up and you see that you are in the middle of the ocean pretty much in  the middle of nowhere you can barely see land  mary can i call the phallic of salmon  dani its high though  noelle were /none/ on the water  marisha it goes vroom and you look over the edge and you can look down and you do see that it is  right below you but it does not fly  noelle how far down is it  mary weve got a ride at least  marisha three stories  laura can we still see bearsley in the sky  marisha as you say that he flies up in his jet pack that hes trying to control  brittany i pull out my gun  laura i go to shoot my last bullet at him /none/  brittany oh no magical bullet  mary and krystina magic bullet  krystina magic bullet  noelle do it its your shot  marisha okay so you all aim your guns all three of you including youve got a gun too youve  got your grenades going maven you put your rifle on the edge of grizz leighs shoulder and use it  for balance and youre going to blow that gun using that one last shot see what you can do  hes kind of zooming so roll for criminal  noelle if it fails maybe we can /none/ release more bees  laura i failed  marisha it goes wide the gun explodes it burns the edge of your hand as it backfires  mary get it out of your hand come on  marisha a little fur singes on all of you the shot goes wide and unfortunately misses he goes  manic laughing about this time jetpacks dont hold a lot of fuel really only like 30 seconds  worth and he did not gauge this well  dani hes not that bright hes not smarter than the average bear  marisha he duck flails on /none/ the edge  mary can i call up the car to the surface  marisha you can  noelle are there more bees in the car  marisha bees  mary bees  marisha the bees fly up they are swarming in a planned hive mind type of formation you want them  to go after bearsley  mary i do  marisha he is completely surrounded by bees he starts screaming oh why did i install that  feature i was being funny  mary i would like to jump onto the roof of the car this could be /none/ crazy  dani youre going to jump three stories  mary no oh were way up on the roof  marisha youre on the roof the cars below you  mary okay has he fallen onto the roof  marisha hes on the roof in front of you all in his power suit like a turtle a little stuck  mary i mean how long does the fireball take to detonate  marisha its instantaneous  mary it is its like a grenade  marisha yes  mary well a grenades like ten seconds  marisha yes  noelle so /none/ we throw it and then  dani its like a firecracker  marisha its a magic grenade its unpacked  noelle do we want to blow him up or do we want to hold him accountable  dani we only realized that the only reason that he did this was because he felt underappreciated  noelle now his bees are appreciating him so i hope he feels good now  dani clearly that was what he was after  noelle i personally would feel way better if we took him back and turned him in  dani to whom  /none/ noelle i dont know  marisha hes currently being stung repeatedly by a swarm of bees  noelle its fun to watch im enjoying myself right now  mary what do you want to do you want to make him drop where  krystina well id like to make him drop down right to where we are but i want the bees to come  noelle hes already on the ground right  mary hes on the roof with us  marisha yes hes in front of you guys  mary i think if you want to blow him up /none/ ill shove a grenade in his mouth and im fine  brittany i feel like its your choice  dani yes this is really more on you i feel like this needs to be your decision  laura maybe you can make out before you  mary hes not the first bear i have loved nor will he be the last  krystina i can take the stinger to 30  mary well what do we want from him at this point we could take him back and maybe meet  paddington but theres no guarantee at that what have /none/ we done we have neutralized the bomb so  what do we want to do we have solved the mystery im trying to speak french  dani at least it was just him and wasnt the entire high bear nation i mean he was the entire  high bear nation  noelle yeah where do we stand right now  brittany i say we blow him the fuck up  dani i personally want to see him blown up  noelle i cant tell if weve won or not  brittany he had his big speech he had his last /none/ moments he broke your heart i say we fucking  blow him up  dani i think he deserves to be blown up  mary well  noelle would that make you feel better  mary no what would make me feel better  noelle wasnt he a fucking asshole  mary he was a fucking asshole i understand that but if we blow him up then what do we do we do  have evidence of the bomb which is fine but is our end game to meet paddington because if it is  then somebody needs to take /none/ a picture of us doing this or its like all of a sudden theres no  evidence if we go back to paddington and he says why did you kill my main operative  noelle i dont think we should kill him i think we should restrain him the bees are heavily  stinging him i dont know if hes allergic or not but its not pleasant either way  marisha oh god it hurts so bad oh god why make it stop please  krystina no ones listening to your complaints  mary lets get this contraption off of /none/ him because if hes got a strap on it could be  loaded you never know whats happening  dani could we have the bees pull him up can we make the bees go away and ill pull him up onto  the roof itself with us  marisha sure the bees eventually disperse  dani ill grab him by the scruff or something  marisha he in his mech suit sits up grizz leigh as the driver you do recognize a lot of  this mechanical contraption and if you want to try and get him out you can /none/ probably do that  pretty easily  dani before she does that i want to look him in the eyes but off to the side not really looking  him in the eyes im trying really hard and i want to say look i know that you and i havent  really had a lot of conversations but i live at the building what im saying is that if you fuck  us right now i will punch you in the face okay dont move were going to get this thing off of  you and if you move i /none/ will punch you in the face  marisha okay  dani okay cool hes all yours grizz  mary just hold onto him in fact take an arm each of you and hold him by his legs because ive  got to take this thing off  marisha okay each one of you one takes an arm one takes the other arm  dani you should grab him by the hair  marisha half of you takes the legs hes completely restrained okay im cooperating  noelle take it off  mary okay i would like to check for traps /none/  laughter  mary can you my darling wonderful bear can you look and see whether or not there are any triggers  or anything else that would potentially cause a selfdestruct mode of going boom and blowing us  all up  noelle well thats what we were going to do to him anyway  mary i know but then were all close to him and i dont want to blow up with him  krystina you want me to type in booby traps  mary yeah  noelle if theyre just sitting nearby that might be a fun /none/ time  marisha he definitely has some pretty dangerous things attached to this some more of those homing  missiles that you guys had on the 00 salmon but nothing that seems like it will explode when you  take it off  krystina can i perform a hard reset on his suit and ensure that theres no damage that comes to  all of us  marisha sure yes  krystina skills  noelle shes really good she just typed in hard reset  marisha he is still locked in though so youll need to get him out of /none/ that  mary okay i would like to take my allen wrench which i brought with me  marisha nice yes  mary it really is a handy tool second only to duct tape it saved matt damons life on mars it  must be good for something down here but i do have an allen wrench  marisha yes with that allen wrench you know this equipment pretty well you easily get him  out yes  mary step on out of your harness of strap on old bearsley pull him out  marisha you know im really sorry /none/ girls i thought  krystina women  marisha im really sorry very respectable agents youre right i was wrong and i thought  that i had to do something extravagant and cruel to garnish your respect and your attention  mary you asshole you had our respect  dani youre really dumb and im saying that  noelle i thought you were a snappy dresser and pretty cool like i respect you a lot less now  mary i dont understand why you would do this you had our respect we followed your orders even  though they were paddingtons /none/ but even so you asked us to do things you asked me to do things  and i did them for you  marisha i hope you know that my actions today dont change the way i feel about you grizz  mary well thats too fucking late for that pal  marisha youre right i definitely tried to kill you yeah i convinced myself  mary do you think it breaks the romantic thread in our relationship when you try and kill us  marisha yeah youre right  brittany its still steamy though  krystina id really like /none/ to know how youre an innocent party and play the victim when were the  ones who had to deal with your abuse of power  marisha no im not saying im innocent at all i lost it a little bit you see ladies ive been  at the high bear nation for ten years thats the second time  krystina get another job  marisha slippy system  mary what no more room for promotion it seems to me youre second in line  marisha i guess i always felt like id always be a number two  mary /none/ well you are a number two today my friend youve acted massively like a steaming pile of  number two  noelle if youre number two then what are we i mean its like jesus man  mary get a hobby pick up a camera do some photography figure out another way to fill this  hole in your life instead of trying to kill us  noelle dont do that  dani love is beautiful  noelle i have very little sympathy for you like why are we even talking you through this right  now i dont care /none/ how you feel all of this balootonium that was you  marisha yeah  noelle that was you  laura we killed crispin glover because of you  noelle is he dead  mary i pull his armored pack away from him at this point  marisha he honestly i didnt expect i didnt foresee a mans murder that actually  noelle did we kill him  laura you pulled his eyeball out of his face  marisha hes probably dead yeah  dani hes crispin glover  noelle it didnt look like there was a lot of blood in /none/ his body anyway im sure he doesnt have  a lot to  brittany hes a warlock im sure  marisha he did keep saying he was an interdimensional being i just thought he was a  crazy homeless guy  noelle well maybe killing him sends him back to where hes supposed to be so we maybe set him free  mary a little wiser for the wear  krystina or starting a new civilization where crispin glover takes over and brings everyone to  noelle well we might have doomed the entire universe  mary thats true what /none/ the hell are we supposed to do with you  laura i say we take him back and let paddington deal with him  noelle i say we take him back i say this mission is in the bag  mary well lets put him in a bag then  marisha you guys dont okay you put another sack over him halfway down hes a tiny bear man  gets a little  mary bend your knees  marisha okay  brittany i poke him in the butt  marisha im sorry okay  krystina i hope you enjoy the /none/ feeling of burlap  mary i push him over ive got a bag from underneath and i tie up the bag throw him over  my fucking shoulder  marisha you guys take him your proof your treasure everything youve got the documents  noelle we have the balootonium  marisha you all get back in the 00 salmon you head back to stilben drive across land back to  the headquarters of the high bear nation in shadowbear shadebarrow its a real place  brittany

bear nation  mary way to go marisha  cheering  marisha thank you  nostalgic screaming  mary i loved this game when i was a kid  marisha wasnt that a great game kerplunk  mary what was it kerplunk  marisha kerplunk when i was trying to remember what this was called i was like marble stick  ball drop game into google and it was like oh kerplunk  noelle these instructions were very  laura that was so confusing  noelle it was terrifying  laura until we saw what /none/ it was  noelle then i was like oh okay what was the red thing i couldnt get my head around that  mary it just meant there were less red  laura less likely to make balls fall right  noelle is that true  marisha no that is the opposite  noelle i think thats the opposite  marisha basically there were six red ones eight yellow ones and ten green ones the red ones were  the base but in a fucked up way by pulling them all up front  brittany yeah we got lucky  /none/ marisha if you pulled from the top bottom then the red ones would have been basically the last  remaining i spent way too long putting the red ones very strategically  mary you did it beautifully  krystina we engineered the heck out of it  mary we did  marisha it was fascinating hearing the are they the most important or the least important i dont know  dani we were bears with sticks  marisha bears with sticks  mary amazing  noelle that was so crazy  marisha youre elite agents  mary i never moved /none/ once  marisha no you guys actually stayed pretty balanced  mary i never moved any of my little things  noelle you succeeded at everything  mary yes i never moved  brittany i had three honeys and i was this close to being like i eat all my honeys and i go  berserk like if we ever needed it i would have been like growling  marisha oh go full bear  brittany just go full bear  noelle thats when i can attack everybody forever unless i just fucking whaled on bearsley  for a long /none/ time  laura we were pretty chill about our attacking people  mary what was great is we just disarmed him verbally its just like you know what  marisha i was deeply interested how that was going to go its kind of amazing  mary we shamed him we fucking shamed him  brittany if you just worked with us we would have been cool but you were a dick you were a  fucking asshole you hurt grizz thats fucked up  dani why are you so mean to her  krystina you could have just gave us /none/ a competitive offer we could have negotiated our  terms and then youd have a cracked staff  marisha you could have just talked to us i was like bad guy archetype complaining about power  being second in charge like no thats good thats good  mary i loved all the james bond stuff oh my god  noelle honey penny  dani that was so funny  noelle it was inspired  brittany 00 salmon broke me of all the puns we came across that defined this game  noelle i liked how long we took hiding the /none/ car only to immediately call the car to us five  seconds later  mary no we went down to the docks we did some damage on the docks and got on the boat before the car  dani i was legitimately concerned about people finding us and stuff like that that was the worst  noelle they could have stolen our car  dani right  mary no we hid it very well burlap sack was good  dani i was afraid those horses were going to rat on us  mary every burlap sack just boom and its /none/ gone  marisha well goodnight everybody thank you all for joining me and maybe next time on the  prequel i dont know im making this up as i go dont quote me on this but well see you next time
