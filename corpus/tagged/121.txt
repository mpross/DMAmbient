dung	 matt hello my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor and the dungeon master for critical  role here at geek  sundry and welcome to todays episode of gm tips where we discuss  fixing gm mistakes  music  matt being the game master for an entire world guiding heroic players through stories from inside  your mind can be an incredibly fun and rewarding experience however you are not infallible  mistakes do happen perhaps a misinterpreted note led to a conflict in story resolution or an npc  you designed to be integral ends up 
none	 killed by the party you let slip a tiny tidbit of secret info  that undermines your big reveal or you gift a player with an item that is far too powerful than  you thought throwing party ingame balance entirely out of whack  how do you correct these unintentional errors to maintain the game you want to run well lets  discuss a number of solutions to these challenges  lets say youre running an encounter that isnt intended to be that difficult either you  miscalculated the power of the enemies or the luck was so against 
none	 the party that a whimpering  anticlimactic tpk is imminent here some examples of how to correct that situation you could  suddenly have an arrow or spell fly in from out of nowhere rocking one of the more dangerous foes  and have an allied npc enter the fray to save them from the claws of defeat you could also consider  that if its an intelligent foe perhaps they see the pcs terrible situation and see them worth  more alive and enslaved than dead have them fight not to the death and instead knock them  unconscious 
none	 or force them to their knees and swear themselves to the foe this could even lead to a  cool escape or revengetype mission in the near future you could also have a terrible screeching  roar blast across the sky and your enemies suddenly look more frightened than theyve ever  been before they quickly assess their situation decide to flee leaving you to the fate  of some possibly scarier creature the wounded party now has to hide from this mystery creature  to survive or you could just have them tpk and explain how the darkness or 
none	 the light possibly  as well fades as they awaken in a stone room shackled and held down suddenly it appears that  a powerful mage has resurrected the party who knows what plans he has for them all he knows is  that they are a party of skilled heroes and they have utility for such a powerful mage chuckles  now mind you if the encounter is intended to be dangerous challenging and possibly deadly let  the dice fall as it may thats part of the game you dont want to undermine the everpresent  danger and 
none	 tension of the game however you also dont want to completely end the story that you  and your players have put into for months and months due to just an unexpectedly shitty scenario  another situation is youve given clues and information and hints as to where to discover and  follow the main plot but no one is figuring it out or picking up on your nudges the game is  quite literally going nowhere dont be afraid to be a little more blunt with your additional  information while some hints may seem like obvious reveals to 
none	 you you also already have all  the information in your head a pc getting these hints in a vacuum might end up either completely  confused or misinterpret the vague info and extrapolate an entirely new and entirely wrong  plot if it goes on too long drop more direct hints via npcs they encounter or have more clues  found as they go or just reveal information as part of the terrain as they progress forward  you can tailor and reshuffle your intended plot points and plot npcs to be a little more direct  with their 
none	 info or even appear in unintended more convenient areas if the pcs arent as focused  or driven as you expected moving the plot along for everyones benefit is more important than  adhering to a theoretical structure that you created in your own little headspace  heres another example of a situation youve offered information about your plot throughout the  game and the players discover an accidental fairly large contradiction in your storytelling  that confuses them or undermines your entire plots direction first off let them discuss the  confusion while you consider options and how to 
none	 retroactively disprove one side of that info pick  which side of the plot conflict is more interesting to pursue and let them seek answers  ingame as to which side is false perhaps an ally who provided some of the info can now be revealed  to be a saboteur or a mole or information was planted by an unseen antagonistic force trying to  throw off the scent  no reveal is immediately necessary you can stall for time between sessions to unravel your mistake  and make it work for you as opposed to against you  
town	 another possibility is you accidentally spill a lead like an info leak or secret about your main  plot and spoil a grand surprise youd been looking forward to dropping down the road first  off dont admit the mistake own it let the party think you intentionally did so and follow  their lead if needed take a break shortly thereafter or if possible even between  sessions and brainstorm a way to alter your current story to enhance the reveal or even  change it to be a baitandswitch so you can still surprise them later on if 
none	 it was indeed info  revealed by an npc you can also have that npc feed them a bunch of additional misinformation to  confuse the players into perhaps not believing anything theyve said you can later play out that  they were either not in their right mind like being mentally controlled by some crazy witchcraft or  perhaps a doppelganger trying to misinform the party doppelgangers are always fun make your  party real nervous trust no one  if the reveal was largely due to a very clever player connecting the dots dont punish them for  
none	 being clever let them enjoy that victory just do your best to not show any confirmation of their  deduction until its put into action leaving them to possibly secondguess their own idea in the  interim then if they stick to it reward them i mean few moments for a pc really beat figuring  out the villains plot and watching it unfold accordingly unless theres nothing they can do to  stop the plot and theyre fucked in which case nervous laugh  another mistakebased situation may involve you giving a magical item or items to the party 
none	 that  quickly appear to be way more powerful than you anticipated it completely wrecks your intended  game balance and can sometime cause the other pcs to resent that unfair advantage that player now  has well here are some suggested ways to handle fixing that scenario you could perhaps introduce  a very powerful entity who lost that magical item or object and has been actively seeking it they  stumble upon the pcs and offer in exchange for the item other grand rewards and the favor of a  powerful being that they can keep in mind 
none	 for future use or the item can slowly be revealed to  be cursed the longer they use it the more dangerous or penalizing it becomes now they must  quest to cleanse it and while doing so lessens its abilities in the end it can now be used  without issue and theyve earned that items true use  another way would be perhaps the enchantment was unstable due to strange arcane experiments and  the item shatters it must now be reforged using safer components which produces a comparable if  possibly lessened version that lasts indefinitely or 
none	 by the time they repair the item the party  has reached a power level where it seems to befit the current game balance  not all these options are possible and there are many other awesome possibilities you can use to  fix these issues that you can find and research online but i hope these tips have at least been  somewhat helpful if one of these scenarios does find its way into your campaign  thank you so much for watching my name is matthew mercer you can find more gm tips here at  geekandsundrycom and
