none	 can  travis 11  matt unfortunately your lack of imagination is finding it difficult based on the words you were  given to formulate enough of a solid creative thought  laura its black onyx means black  taliesin honest statue of a hog its an honest statue of a hog  sam doesnt know what onyx is hes picturing  matt he barely knows what a dog is at this point  travis if you want to reach in here and reach in my bag oh  liam sam you can do this to me too  matt 
none	 and there you have it the onyx mastiff is there before you  laura its an onyx mastiff its an onyx statuette of mastiff if you use an action to  speak the command word  liam which we dont know  laura i know and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you it becomes a  living mastiff for up to six hours  liam i thought the guy told us wed have to figure it out did he whisper anything to you  laura it was etched on the bottom and

none	 oh my goodness  laura the creature reverts to its figurine form it reverts to a figurine early if it drops to zero  hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it when the  creature becomes a figurine again its property cant be used again for ugh seven days  travis get to the bottom part come on  laura mastiff has an intelligence of eight laughs and can speak common its smarter than you  sam oh its a talking dog  laura yeah  marisha i wonder if 
none	 it has a name  matt it can also see invisibility  sam it can see invisibility  matt thats why its a good guard dog if you  laura and objects within that range  sam i like this dog  liam the only important thing on that paper  marisha and how long does he last he just lives until hes done  taliesin six hours  laura sorry i didnt mean to read all that and make it not interesting  travis if you set camp though good sentry  sam but we need to know the 
none	 magic word  laura we know it its good doggie  sam oh we know the word already  matt its part of the enchantment yeah  marisha good doggie  sam can you teach us how to say that in elvish  taliesin dont teach him how to say it in elvish  laura you can say it in common he understands common  taliesin he understands common thats fair  liam velena voelena  sam voelelena  laura yeah thats it  sam voellalala  travis all right we start walking back to whitestone  laura grog im 
dung	 sorry  sam lets get the dog out here  taliesin lets hold off on the dog  matt as you guys make your way towards the castle theres a small group of figures you see  three armored whitestone soldiers with one figure following them different outfit looks to be  simple dark blues and grays dark skin short dark hair carrying his crossbow at his side as you  make eyes you immediately recognize this as jarett  marisha jarett  matt jarett is coming down and he sees aye friends it has been a while im so 
none	 happy to see  that you survived its been a while is everyone okay  liam how long  matt aye most better part of a week  marisha so it is like saturday here right time runs the same  matt yes  marisha so it wasnt yesterday  sam why did you taste the wind  matt i dont know why its a strange question  laughter  taliesin it tastes like saturday certainly  matt more confused by the question but its fine all right  laura how are things here  matt well sighs lets just 
none	 say better for the time being and as you look up what you didnt  notice before when you saw the clouds is theres this slight light blue hue to the entire sky  taliesin excellent  matt theres this very faint shimmer to it and he goes ah the barrier is now up which is  good as soon as they finished that allura drake and kima all left to find information on the green dragon  liam where  matt i did not inquire as to the location but they said they should be back in the next 
none	 few days  laura cassandra might know  taliesin she will  marisha when did they leave  matt its three days ago they were hoping to get insight on thordaks current situation while  we amass as many armored folks here as possible and continue to reach out for allies i think that  is the main goal right now is to find as many allies as we can it was interesting to put a  stake into this fight  laura so youre leading an army  matt well were building whoever we can in this vicinity theres 
none	 not many at the very least  defend in case this ends up falling  laura and whats your role in it  matt welcome back slight little technical issue there were going to roll back in little bit of  information step into the moment as jarett has walked down the steps of whitestone and began a  conversation with vox machina about the current situation here he says how currently allura  kima and drake are off trying to find information on the green dragon raishan and trying to  discover what best can be done regarding the 
none	 attack on thordak in emon here i am doing the  best i can to build what armed forces we have at our disposal and were trying to reach out to  bring whatever allies are willing to put their stakes into this battle but yes this is a  monumental task based on my own experience and im doing the best i can but bear with me its  laura we have faith in you jarett  matt thank you im glad somebody does asum actually just arrived here about two or three  hours ago  laura yes 
none	 we were wondering what happened to him  marisha havent seen him in a while  matt as were we last we heard from gilmore that he disappeared with tofor within emon after the attack  liam shauns still in the city  matt shaun is still in the city i believe hes actually up meeting with asum and cassandra right  now in the castle  taliesin lets clean up and head in that direction id imagine  matt certainly well if you need me ill be around just  marisha jarett  matt yes  marisha has there 
none	 been any eyes on the green dragon here recently  matt none of us have seen the dragon none of us know its whereabouts and attempts to scry have  been balked i do not know  marisha okay thank you  matt its all right i believe there is information on the whereabouts of the white  marisha do we know where  matt i do not know that is more for what they hold at the castle  marisha okay  matt yell loudly if you need me  marisha thank you  matt it warms my heart 
none	 to see you all safe  marisha same  matt he gives a little salute and a smile and continues with the other guards back towards the  center of the city as you guys ascend the steps to castle whitestone you enter the large gates  that slowly creak open as you come to the familiar interior you can hear the voices echoing in the  distance from the nearby what was once the guest dining area of the castle has now been converted  into a war room  as you approach the outside of the doors theyre 
none	 partially ajar on the inside you can see your  sister cassandra sitting at a table gilmore is leaned back arms crossed tugging on the end of  his chin goatee and you see seeker asum currently facing towards cassandra theyre in  midconversation right now as soon as you enter the room it is good to know that you all  survive as theyve told me  marisha same to you asum  matt as he turns and looks towards you you can see the side of his face that has all the heavy  tattoos now bears heavy 
none	 acid scars that have blended the tattoos into the scarring its not a  very pretty sight but he seems to at least be in one piece right now he still has his thick  hooded cloak around his shoulders and where normally he has a shaved head some of the hair is  growing in in areas that can grow hair based on the damage to this side of his face  sam what happened to you  matt what happened to me is i made out a lot better than many of the people there that day  
none	 this ill take this  marisha im so sorry  matt its fine ive had worse trust me come sit cassandra sits up my brother she comes  up and gives you a big hug and holds you for a second  laura pardon our appearance and stench  taliesin yes  travis do we smell  laura were covered in that black messiness i assume  taliesin i hadnt even noticed actually  matt you do and it is its scent has faded a bit but you all still are not in the most  presentable means however the 
none	 conversations dire tone seems to be enough where no one pays  much mind to it  taliesin we were successful i will let the others fill you in with some details although i  do and im going to double check and im going to find the brief letter explaining what ive set  up with vex although it will not have any of the reason why but it will have at least the nature  of whats been done and we have acquired well vex vexahlia if you would  laura another vestige  matt as you pull 
none	 it out they all step back gilmore leans forward very good  laura i would love for you to take a look at it shaun  matt i would love to have a look at it he takes it as you hand it to him it actually curls  around the back of his hands and whips back into a strong tensile stance and he thats weird  he takes it and starts looking over it as cassandra looks back im glad youre all safe  and apparently named welcome to whitestone lady vexahlia  laura thank you  matt 
none	 she takes it folds it ill have this put in the books immediately  taliesin i appreciate your kind generosity  matt i will request more information soon  taliesin well see yes that might be complicated but yes  matt anyway have a seat asum please inform them of what youve been telling us as you all  find a seat he sits there quietly his eyes darting around in his head ruminating over the  thoughts and trying to formulate his presentation he crosses his fingers in front of his face  things are a bit of a 
none	 mess within the city none are allowed to leave living under the watch of  the wyvern guard hundreds of lizardmen worshipers of thordak have been watching the city from above some  have tried to flee beyond the walls but ultimately end up being returned at the end of a  set of talons and not seen again thordak calls a gathering every dusk of the surviving populace  tens of thousands forced to come and gather at the center of the remnants of the cloudtop district  he gloats instills fear in all that behold this and offers 
town	 forgiveness to those who offer fealty  to him all are to cheer his name applaud his statements and thank him for his mercy those  that fail to do so are pulled from the crowd by his lizardmen and devoured by the beast himself  lined up to the slaughter as a show and there is laughter from the beast that pushed them into his  maw most of the wealth of the city is now amassed in the ashes of the district forming a massive  wall of shiny chunk and coin like a nest around the fucking 
none	 beast hes enslaved a number of the  greatest sculptors of the city to begin making his likeness in the surrounding stone they chisel  away at the tall proud walls of the interior showing his terrible face where it does not  belong a vain fucker hes crazy that one whats more dangerous than an intelligent dragon  than one whos crazy ive been keeping an eye as best as i can thordak gives direct orders to his  wyvern guard often some off to communicate i presume with the other members of the conclave i  know not 
none	 ive been stuck within the city most survivors stay indoors ive been working with the  clasp believe it or not to shepherd over a thousand people below the city streets for  protection the lesser of two evils to be sure but at the very least at the moment they have  nothing to gain by working against us at this juncture naught but six hours ago the cinder king  was roaring in anger his cries echoing through the streets the people fell to their knees  thinking this was the end stepped up from his volcanic throne 
none	 and sent the majority of his army  eastward i used this distraction to slip into the nowunguarded lyceum find a port scroll and a  sigil for whitestone before they returned came here to see all of you alive so thats the best  news ive had in weeks thats the best i have to bring you about the current state of the city  marisha thats our home  matt thats our home  taliesin what is eastward  matt kymal westruun technically here  laura did you bring any other survivors with you  matt i was 
none	 the only one who could make it into the lyceum unseen tofor is still back there  fighting the good fight shes working with shenn theyre trying to get as many below ground as  possible and out of harms way  liam and greyskull keep  matt i havent seen it ive been within the city walls  laura did you say thordaks wife did i mishear you  sam wyvern guard  marisha wyvern i heard wife  laura wife and guards is what i heard and i was so fucking confused  matt sorry  marisha wait 
none	 his wyvern guard is often  matt he sent a majority  marisha oh thats still me manufacturing shit okay  taliesin we dont know where theyve been sent we dont know why  sam eastward  matt thats all ive seen  taliesin we need to find out where theyre going  matt i had to use that time to get to the lyceum usually its too heavily guarded  taliesin no of course just making a list  laura youve done so much  matt ive done so little theres more to be done but the more time 
none	 that passes whatever it  is theyre planning im sure is getting closer to fruition  marisha do we have any known whereabouts on the white or the green dragon  matt he looks over and gilmore steps forward sets the bow down and says first and foremost  this is a glorious piece i could only hope to eventually create something of its majesty he  hands it over a bit creepy in ways but i think youll make good use of it once we complete the  barrier and put quite a bit of concentration each day into 
none	 maintaining it of which pike has been of  great aid to me between the arcane and divine magics i think we found a fine balance  hopefully but anyway ive been putting the rest of my energies towards trying to procure this  information the green raishan as i believe youve told me eludes my watch my gaze there is  a lot of protection around that one i get the sense that of those in the conclave she is  probably the most trained in my arts  laura shes the one that released thordak so that wouldnt 
dung	 surprise me  marisha shes on my shit list  matt i think shes on a lot of peoples shit lists mine as well the white however i know  not its name but i was able to look towards it i was able to find it sitting amongst a large pile  of rock and rubble looks like a fallen city crumbled and destroyed from what i saw there  were smoldering ruins toppled landscapes of buildings and temples arcane crystals crashed and  cracked deep inside a ravine there the white dragon perched setting up this slowrolling  
none	 winter amongst a shivering horde of dragonborn  travis oh shit  marisha what did he just say what  liam shivering horde of dragonborn  travis amongst a horde of dragonborn  laura draconia  matt what remains of it  liam fuck  matt that was days ago  taliesin thats a card we no longer have  matt i need to be careful when doing this  liam the city was razed  matt from what i could see yes  travis did you see any motion any slaves  matt oh yes there were many survivors 
none	 but they were not in the best of states  travis this white dragon does he bring weather or any sort of change its all ice and snow yeah  matt the very essence of each ancient wyrm if you will carries with it its own element it  slowly transforms the landscape around where it takes up its new den if it seems to sit atop the  remains of the onceproud draconia then it now falls under the icy grasp of the beast  liam and the will of the people there  matt i could not look 
none	 that deep my apologies  marisha is this just with a simple scrying spell okay  taliesin we must be careful we cannot let whitestone be discovered  marisha yes and as weve learned before scrying can alert your position  matt at this point in time you guys hear heavy footsteps heading up from the lower floor of the  castle you hear two voices shout out lady cassandra lady cassandra they enter the room  real fast you see one man probably in his mid20s or so sweat pouring down his face his  eyes wide my lady 
none	 at that point you hear echoing outside of the castle this loud  piercing shrieking roar  marisha oh my god  matt roar  laura shit balls motherfucker  matt its distant but even at that distance it is loud  laura gilmore does the screen keep us hidden  matt you look back and even in his most damaged state gilmore had an essence of confidence and  this is a moment where youve never really seen him so pale were about to find out arent we  travis im going outside  laura im going outside too 
none	  liam i walk up to shaun and slap my hand on his forearm and say what about the bow is there  anything you can tell us about the bow  matt in due time keep it at the ready  marisha i turn to cassandra we need to get all of the citizens underground immediately  taliesin we cant fit everybody  matt we can certainly try she turns to the guard gather everyone we can gather and  theres another roar from outside this time louder still go now everyone starts rushing  down the stairs to

dung	 dont know  matt are you guys exiting the castle now  laura yes  marisha do it by hand we might not have that much time  matt as you step out into the front open patio area just outside of the castles main gates you  look up and that faint blue shimmer that encases and you can now see it as a dome and it comes  down around just directly around the city closing at the very outskirts of the castle you  look in the distance as you see a few dark shapes growing larger 
none	 and larger  marisha theyre coming this way  taliesin hold  matt i need you to make a perception check all of you  marisha fuck  travis 17  sam nine  marisha 26  taliesin 23  liam 26  laura 16  matt all right vax keyleth and percy you guys glance off and you can see there are a number of  shapes it looks to be probably two three dozen large winged entities flapping  you cant make out too much of the detail of their form but you can definitely see some  
town	 sort of aerial transport with large wings at the forefront of them you see one far larger than the  rest while you cant make out the details at this distance the one thing you do catch is the bits  of sunlight that peek through the clouds hitting the side of its hide a bright piercing white color  travis fucking fucked  matt you see it coasting at an angle around the outside of the city making its way very quickly  towards the outskirts of the town  marisha its thordaks army asum said himself were eastward 
none	 were directly in its path  taliesin hold  marisha dragons have truesight they already know were here  sam maybe they cant get through this  marisha any second we wait longer more people could die  laura send out the guards  matt the guards are already running down by the way based on cassandras orders and are making  their way towards the city you can already see people coming out of the streets and looking up  covering their ears some people are falling to their knees and crying  marisha percy  taliesin pick them 
none	 up keep running until the moment they cant  liam they know were here this is not a coincidence theyre not flying by they know  were here they know  matt whoosh you now see the dragon and the flying horde have just come within a mile of the  southern portion of the city  marisha percy  taliesin wait  liam do it  laura no dont do it  liam theyre coming for us  taliesin this is my home wait  travis this is his home  marisha percy  taliesin keep moving  marisha 
none	 you have five seconds to come up with a better fucking plan or i am doing it  taliesin spread out keep moving find a position  matt okay what order are you guys rushing down in  liam what are we looking at from our vantage point  matt you guys are looking down at the wide 60foot earth path that leads down from the base  of castle whitestone into the city itself  taliesin if im towards the front im moving everyone towards the house where we made the  tunnel that goes underneath the sun tree 
none	  matt all right so we have percy at the front  travis ill be right behind him  matt okay grogs right behind percy  laura ill follow behind grog  liam were up above though or are we on ground level at this point  matt you guys are now on ground level youre above on the grade that leads down into the city itself  laura i pull out the broom and i get on the broom  matt okay so youre on the broom  marisha its clear theyre not deviating the path  laura its 
town	 not clear we could just be in their way  travis he said theyre curving  matt theyre now curving around the outside of the western side of the valley  taliesin what are you going to write what are you going to write  marisha i would throw up the de rolo crest just like before its a good alert sign  laura people would just come out screaming they wont know where to go  marisha then come up with a better damn plan  matt roar echoing through the valley you watch as the entire crowd of 
dung	 these entities flies around  the west side of the city curves past the shadow of the light of the sky you can see the dark  heavy shadow of the dragon and the wyverns pass over the western side of the city you can hear  distant screams as people begin to freak out at this it passes over the western side of the city  flying right towards the castle  marisha percy  matt arcs past the castle over the forest and the entire cluster slowly flaps down and lands at  the southernmost beginning peak of 
none	 the alabaster sierras just north of the city the dragon  crash noise lands  taliesin alert everyone you see  marisha theyre scouting us  taliesin tell them to get underground tell them to be silent  laura they dont see us but they know were nearby  travis what direction are they looking  matt right now theyre looking in all directions actually  laura we need to get everybody underground while we can  liam we have time we have time  taliesin thank you find everyone tell them silence we still have the cavern we built 
none	  underground start making it larger  marisha okay  travis shall we scatter spread the word  laura spread the word tell everyone to get underground  taliesin under the tree  marisha i go to the cavern under the sun tree and i start casting move earth and i start clearing it  as fast as i can  matt okay its going to take you a while but you begin building this cavern  marisha as fast as i can  taliesin more people  sam where are we telling people to go  travis were scattering 
tavern	  taliesin theres the inn that was broken its got an entrance they either go there or they go  underneath the castle  sam that can hold 30 40 people  taliesin shes making it bigger  laura can we send people under the castle as well  sam okay under the castle yeah  matt you guys all begin scattering grabbing everyone you can the guards are starting to  gather people and as you get the word out people begin to quiet holding their mouths the guards  are holding people silently people begin ushering en masse 
none	 up towards this giant exodus from the  city pouring like a funnel up this walkway to the base of castle whitestone keyleth as youre down  there youre pressing the dirt itself is slowly molding its way into this large cavern pressing  downward further and further and opening further down and opening  marisha fallout cavern style big lower bigger lower  matt you get about three platforms down before the earth stops responding  marisha what do you mean  travis fucking ziggurat  marisha the fucking ziggurat  taliesin other way other way  marisha i 
none	 go the other way  laura dont empty out the earth too much or it wont support the city  marisha fallout style little pods  matt all right you start creating all these various things and people start ushering in its  getting to the point now where theres so many people you hear crying children families pressed  in youre feeling claustrophobic and the rooms getting hotter and hotter the more bodies that are  in there you keep concentrating and pushing the earth out you can feel the sweat beads pouring  down your face concentrating concentrating 
none	 you hear the crying and sobbing and people trying to  comfort those that are freaking out every now and then you hear a distant echoing cry a scream of a  dragon in the distance and everyone in the room tenses and the sobbing gets even louder then  hushed again with whispering silence you keep pushing and keep pushing opening you guys all  begin to gather the rest as you watch with that final cry the dragon and the wyverns pick up  whoosh and swoop towards the center of the valley arcing to the west and 
none	 do a wide sweep of  the mountain range flapping wings  laura wheres gilmore  matt gilmore has been bringing people en masse down to the castle you havent seen him for a number  of probably 15 20 minutes or so the dragons coast around and begin to disappear in the  southeastern distance where they came from you do at this point catch gilmore who has moved to  the top of the castle and is currently arms out concentrating pouring all the energy he can into  that barrier  travis looks like the spell worked 
none	  liam good work good work  laura gilmore good job  matt he eventually comes down from the top of the castle he is eye sockets are sunken you can  see hes pouring with sweat im going to need a spa day because im done  laura wheres pike  matt you guys find pike she during this whole period was over by the temple of pelor that she  was helping right and construct going over and finding out where shes been placed you guys see  that shes shepherded in a good 200 people into that 
none	 temple and has been keeping them divinely  protected the whole time as soon as you approach the outside the people begin to slowly disperse  back into the city pike walks out looking out to the sky and locks eyes with you youre back  runs up and gives you a big hug jumps into your arms at this point you catch her and realize how  heavy she is with the armor on put her back down  laura i drop her because im fucking weak  matt guys hi  laura you did an amazing job with 
none	 that  matt that was mostly him ive never done something like that before that was everything  okay in the feywild im sorry i lost my connection we had to finish this ritual  laura no it was fine  marisha hi pike sorry  matt dont be im glad youre all okay  sam do you remember the feywild  matt yeah we were  sam okay just making sure  laura he doesnt remember pike  matt you dont remember  travis yeah apparently we went to the feywild and everybody remembers it but me and percy 
none	  matt why is that  laura i dont know  taliesin its funnier that way  marisha maybe you can look at his head later  laura maybe theres a way to cure it  travis im just too smart  matt she walks up and takes a look at you walks up to grog has a good look at the side of your  head knocks you in the temple a few times  travis what do you see  matt theres nothing physical ill try a restoration she would have lets see here  sam pike stats 
none	  taliesin i was about to say you have an ashley app thats so adorable  travis dont make me any dumber  laura grog thats not possible  matt yeah shes going to try greater restoration let me check something here real fast  sam that was not fun  laura no  marisha percy are you sure its okay for me to let these people out  taliesin of course its not but yes definitely let them out well have to make it more secure  and safer  laura i think its gotten quite a bit away 
none	 from us  matt so pike reaches up the gauntlets begin to glow and as she touches each side of your  temples your eyes close as some of you watch this grogs eyes flash open and where his pupils  and the whites of his eyes were you now see a flash of divine golden orange light as it fades  you are slammed with a series of memories that were previously taken from you and you recall  every moment in the feywild  travis surprised noises  sam im sorry im sorry you didnt get to kill 
none	 anything im sorry  laura no he did he still killed the big bad guy  sam oh you did you did you killed the one thing okay good  travis i got petrified  laura yeah well stoned  travis i tried diplomacy never again  sam lesson learned  travis holy shit  laura can you only do that one time a day  matt no i can do it once more  sam maybe well  travis no its okay yeah percy will remember the nude massage  matt she walks up to percy  liam think 
none	 of what hes losing though  taliesin im not losing it  laura potentially  taliesin no because it doesnt matter its there anyway  sam actually i dont know i dont know  matt yeah you have overlapping memories so she reaches up and you bend down she takes your  glasses off hands them to vex reaches up and touches the sides of your temple now  concentrate close your eyes and theres a burst of warmth towards the front of your lobe almost  like someones dipping your head into hot water and with that theres a 
none	 smattering of memories  that are rushing into your mind it takes you a moment your head swims and you have to almost  sit down you almost stumble off your back foot as your brain now has to reorganize those lost  moments seven days now immediately restored  taliesin seven days ten minutes  sam greater restoration kills modify memory  taliesin oh but do i remember having the fake memory or do i not remember having a fake  memory  matt you would remember the spell being cast you remember the fake memory but youre aware 
none	 that  its fake  sam and that i did it  taliesin yes  matt oh yeah  sam fuck  liam just say thank you percival  matt did it work  taliesin i give her a big hug im so tired im sorry im going to sit down  laura what  matt glasses  laura oh but theyre so fun to look through all right  taliesin theyll give you a headache  matt she takes the glasses and as youre resting she takes your hand away from your head  and puts them back on 
none	  marisha i start slowly releasing people from the pods  taliesin thank you  matt people begin to emerge and where once there was this air of tension fear and desolate  acceptance of the end theres laughter theres smiles and even more tears as people begin to  realize they have another day to live  laura can we tell the people as they come out i know youll want to celebrate but please keep it  as quiet as possible tonight we dont know when it could be back  matt theres a stillness and a slow 
town	 understanding and nodding while everyone takes in the  information one young woman smeared dirt on her chin dried tears on her cheek steps forward and  goes thank you thank you and everyone else starts saying thank you thank you thank you  this sea of thankyous begins to spread through the crowd immediately in your vicinity  sam dont thank us thank shaun gilmore  laura gilmore and pike allura  matt they all quietly go back to their silence and begin to slowly disperse themselves throughout  the city where they were before this incursion happened  
none	 marisha i go up to percy  travis i forgot that shaun was gilmores first name  laura he was like whos shaun  sam intelligence of six  liam so fucking method method man  matt keyleth  marisha i hope you know that i would never  taliesin shut up thank you  sam i hope you know that i was only trying to improve your life with a wonderful happy memory  and it was mostly true  taliesin i know where you sleep people work for me  matt asum has caught up to you now 
none	 as you guys are walking back to the city you can see him  hes still eyes to the sky not truly trusting this quiet he goes it seems we dont have any  time to lose what resources do you have to fight back what have you learned please tell me you  have better news than i have  travis well weve got a few of these vestiges so were a little powered up but were not quite  sure what their full abilities are its significant but we think they do more were just  not sure 
none	 how much  matt what more do you need  laura can i fly up in the air while this conversations going on  matt sure  sam dont go too high  laura not too high  sam we dont know where the thing is  laura no i know i want to go to the very top where i see the shimmer  matt yeah and its a squat shimmer not a full dome and its like a very extended type dome  laura okay but its high enough that i mean its higher than the castle  
none	 matt its high enough where you can get  about 80 feet up and you start to see enough  detail in the shimmer where youre like okay im getting close  laura okay the direction that the dragons went is this stupid can i shoot my oracle arrow in  that direction  sam no absolutely not  laura why  sam highpitched why would you bring attention to us  laura its an arrow  liam theyre long gone  matt they are gone the time has passed theyre miles and miles and miles and miles and miles 
none	 at  the speed they were travelling youre a good shot but i dont know if you could arc an arrow that far  laura oh well i guess thats true i thought it was a tenminute because its fenthras i thought  it was a longass arrow  travis cant you tell what direction the dragons were heading  laura oh wait okay so the oracle arrow is it like you fire it and then it shoots somewhere and  it sticks there and i can see through it for ten minutes  matt correct or see through it 
none	 as its fired the minute it leaves the bow you can project your  sight through the arrow for up to 10 minutes  sam it cant fly for infinity  matt no it still arcs like a regular arrow  laura that makes sense i foresaw it just going because i thought it was like a special kind of  arrow  liam its really good for people without flying brooms  laura right cool then im not going to use it because now i understand how it works ive  learned something  taliesin what direction were the 
none	 wyverns travelling were they travelling back or were  they travelling along  matt they were heading southeast  travis so not back they came from the west right  matt they swooped in from the west from that side  taliesin but they originated in the west and they are currently travelling southeast  matt correct however it was vorugal it was the white dragon which from what gilmore is saying  has been roosting over at the top of the ruins of draconia  taliesin which is to the east  sam so this was not the group 
none	 that had set off from emon  travis to the west  taliesin no its draconia is to the southeast why do i know that  sam here heres the map were up here this is the group that was coming from emon these guys  came from somewhere over here wheres draconia  laura can i cast primeval awareness and see if its within six miles of us right now still or  if its farther away from that  marisha i thought that draconias on a whole another continent  taliesin yeah it is its over here  
none	 matt its over on wildemount  laura i want to see if theyre just camping out around us or if theyre going away  taliesin are they going back  matt using for dragons i assume right  laura yes its my favored enemy  matt yeah i would say as part of your primeval awareness  sam if this is the united states were in maine emon is la  matt yeah sensing at this point with the day of travel and everything you have no sense of  dragons in that direction or anything  laura okay theyre 
none	 further than six miles away  matt yeah there are minor essences in the northern area but nothing beyond what youve  already sensed in the alabaster sierras nothing on the level of strength that the draw of an  ancient dragon would bring on your radar  laura okay  travis to answer your previous question there are four vestiges left  taliesin that we know of  liam theres a dagger theres a cloak armor theres a staff  sam wait theres other objects that we havent  matt all right  marisha four left because we have 
none	 whisper right  laura no no we dont have whisper  marisha so theres five  matt do we have any other allies friends people who are sworn to aid us and  travis ooh yeah yeah your parents  marisha yeah  taliesin thats right  laura technically the elves of syngorn are building an army however who knows if theyll  actually come through  taliesin the werewolves could be called upon  matt i think they would understand it would do them well to help what is a threat to all of us  taliesin you would 
none	 think  sam one werewolf has vowed allegiance to us  laura in the feywild  travis in another plane of existence which i dont know if thats a problem  matt not going to count on that one  taliesin its not as ridiculous as you think  sam yes your former pals  taliesin whatever remnants of draconia perhaps  matt wait so the last time we saw the main portion the bulk of emons army from fort daxio was  sent to syngorn before this attack happened  marisha yes  matt do we have any knowledge 
none	 on their whereabouts  marisha a lot are there  matt theyre there  marisha a lot of at least all of our guards from emon are in syngorn right  laura no our guards arent in syngorn  marisha not our personal guards but emons guards  laura no  matt you did see quite a few soldiers from emon there  laura oh we did  sam yes  laura i was distracted  matt thats okay you did have a lot to think about with your dad  taliesin they would not answer our call but if 
none	 someone has relations with the clasp they are  always an option for manpower  matt well i have been dealing with them and definitely theyre not much of an army but  theyre definitely good at acquiring information and i currently have a few of them trying to find  out as much as they can about thordak  marisha theres also the ashari druids who will definitely want to help our cause  taliesin this is very true  matt that is good to know well any more that come your way or any possibilities you have to 
none	  bring more to our cause please do so  sam theres a candlemaker who might help out i would put him in the strong maybe category as well  taliesin dont mention that vex flies  matt good well keep tabs on those youve found and any possibilities of others especially those  who have i dont know more of these vestiges that you speak of or armies at their disposal  big weapons anything ill take anything at this point really  taliesin there are options but we need to discuss what happened today this changes some things 
none	  travis yeah we need more offence less defense i dont know if that will work a second time  taliesin youre mad we need defense this is not a site of a victory this is a site of our end we  need bunkers  laura yeah we need to move everybody underground the same way we did in emon  marisha i can spend more time fleshing out and reinforcing the bunkers to make them  taliesin ill discuss a warning system to get people underground  sam but when the dragon came here just now they saw 
none	 nothing correct  taliesin we hope  sam is there a way that we can spread false rumors that the city of whitestone has been  magically moved to another plane or something  laura thats wonderful thats smart  sam some way of getting that word to draconia or i dont  taliesin putting the word out that were other places than we are putting the sound  matt asum thinks to himself and goes  liam cant we drop it into the clasps pipeline  matt i can do that definitely we can find a way to get 
none	 that information there are a number  who have sworn allegiance to thordak and you know some folks who dont see honor but the necessity  to stay alive override any sort of previous friendships  travis best not to mention our name i dont think were cool with the clasp after our last  meeting  laura yeah they dont like us  matt good to know ill look about planting that information ill do the best i can in that  regard ive been told that youve already felled another of the conclave is that correct  travis 
none	 yes  laura thats true umbrasyl dead and gone  matt that will certainly stir some attention from them  laura yeah and if not that then the message left in there  taliesin they know we did it  travis strange that he had all those wyverns with him though umbrasyl had none he was by  himself  liam they dont like each other though this is some sort of loose partnership  travis yeah but didnt they say the white one was more savage more emotional  laura the white one was more vain  marisha yeah 
none	 the black one umbrasyl is the one thats  sam oh youre right the white one is a hunter its primal hates others youre right  taliesin maybe the armys going to head to no we could be so lucky if it was on its way to  attack it  marisha black ones like torture right  laura yeah they like to make people suffer  taliesin i feel like there should be trading cards  sam so the white ones like predator  laura shut up theres notes somewhere in here  matt just be warned fell one 
none	 dragon that might make them nervous fell another and thats almost  certain to bring retaliation  taliesin we were hoping to distract them  matt well the next wyrm you decide to fell will probably be the start of this war  travis can we ask why would it bring retaliation how would they know it was us  taliesin we did sign the card  marisha we left our names  laura maybe the next one we can sign as somebody else  travis what if we dont sign it  liam even if we dont they probably 
none	 are going to get much more vindictive overall  marisha and just as much as we can scry on them they can scry on us im sure theyve been  watching us  taliesin i dont think they know where we are i think they know when we travel i just dont think  they know where we are  matt have any of the living ones seen you  laura have any what  matt have any of the living ones seen you and know you for who you are  travis when we killed the first one there 
none	 were a bunch of jewels in the wall and we saw a bunch of  eyeballs  taliesin he did not know our name but he has seen us  laura raishan saw us the white one saw us all of them saw us  matt then it is very possible  sam wait a second you just said no one knew we were here none of them knew we were here  taliesin here  sam they just attacked here and we just got back here  laura gilmore was scrying on them it took three days for him 
none	 to get here thats how he knew  sam because gilmore was scrying on them got it not because we have a leak  taliesin we probably do we should assume we have a leak  sam im going to blame shaun  taliesin is he shaun now  matt youre more than welcome to  sam sorry chuckles  matt hes sitting down wiping his brow with this really fine scarf  marisha judging based on what happened in emon we know that they have an insider we just dont  know who yet  sam they do we 
none	 know this  taliesin i would assume that theres nothing we say that they dont know at this point  laura they struck during a political  marisha during a council meeting  laura somebody has to be telling them things  marisha someone probably very high up  laura it could be raishan taking the form of a human again for all we know  sam who was there and lived besides us  matt jarett catches up by the way panting is everyone all right  laura yes how are the citizens did you get everyone in there 
none	  matt everyone seems to be safe and accounted for there was a lot of fear of course but  elation whatever you did and he looks at you and looks at shaun whatever you did keep doing  it please  travis i insight check jarett  matt make an insight check  travis seven  matt its hard to read that fella slippery  liam can i do an insight check on asum  matt you may  laura what are you doing  sam ooh that was a luck  liam first one was good anyway  
none	 laura oh youre just hoping first one was really good  liam damn i can choose whichever one i want 21  matt 21  laura about jarett youre insighting jarett  sam seeker asum  taliesin perhaps we should not have assumed  marisha hey travis how is it youre on this side of the table  travis well i was looking for a loot crate have you guys seen any loot crates  sam oh well ive got some of the great swag that you can get in a loot crate why this shirt came  in one 
none	 last week  travis thats incredible how do i get one of those  sam you go to lootcratecomcriticalrole to see your selection and then if you sign up you  get three dollars off the first month which is a really good deal  taliesin ironically when we played the game at home this is exactly what wed do  matt totally  liam sam who are you talking to youre facing a potted plant  sam im talking to seeker asum hes a big fanboy  matt gilmore stands up and catches the edge of vaxs shoulder  
tavern	 liam hey  matt all right so whats your plan whats the next order of business  laura get you a drink i think  matt a drink would be great  taliesin i think we talk and drink  laura yes we need to talk about barricading underground making it more secure  matt come i can definitely use that right now  you guys are led into the nearest open it looks to be an unused tavern but there are  drinks ale and things that are at the ready there isnt much commerce currently happening in  
none	 the city since right now everythings in survival mode so theres no exchange of money you guys  are presented with drinks the lanterns are lit on the inside from other villagers that are just  happy to help and the central table is set where you all sit around and quietly have a few sips  liam while everyones sitting can i just pull him over to a corner for a second  matt yeah  liam how are you doing personally  matt me  liam yeah  matt wondrous im doing great chuckles im exhausted  liam

none	 you think  that would be  matt asum goes there are cities that use brass in parts of construction in wildemount thats as far  gilmore leans forward and goes no thats in the elemental plane of fire thats a  dangerous terrible place that you should never go  travis we were already there once actually  taliesin terrible dangerous places you should never go are practically our middle name  laura we saw thordak there actually  matt oh even more of a reason not to go  marisha well hes here now so fire planes probably 
none	 safer  taliesin shes got a very fair point  laura why do you ask grog  travis well look the plate of the dawnmartyr is in a city of brass but i dont know where that is  laura i bet that sounds something pike would like  travis draconia is in wildemount  matt draconia is in wildemount yes  travis right and so is the big white fuck right  taliesin yes are any of the vestiges in wildemount  travis the city of brass  matt whereabouts are the vestiges  liam one at the bottom

none	 its fine id made the bottom floors too small anyway more space next time  liam you ever want to revisit home  matt maybe nah i need to stay here and maintain this  laura yes you do if you dont mind  sam what about the endless maze of the abyss thats another place that were supposed to go  marisha also another plane of existence  matt i dont know much about the abyss but i know that its probably the worst place ever  laura abyssal thats where demons come from  travis worse than the 
none	 fire plane  matt thats correct  laura thats the thing that killed pike  travis wait isnt that where the rakshasas going to be  marisha thats in the nine hells  liam hes a devil  taliesin ironically is somewhere else entirely  liam and i think we can table meowmix for a little bit somebody told us it takes a while  laura months and months  marisha months but we also dont want to wait until  liam not forever  travis whos got a map  sam ive got a map  travis wheres the 
none	 ozmit sea  taliesin before we even think of this we should see what were i dont think were going to  collect all of the vestiges we should see what other vestiges we think are going to be helpful  sam its like the pacific ocean  travis which direction is it towards draconia  sam no draconias across the atlantic ocean in france  marisha but the ozmit sea is where the water ashari reside and i have to go there anyway its  also where pike is very familiar im pretty sure thats the sea that she 
none	 sailed  liam and the vestige there is the staff  laura whisper right  sam whisper the blade  marisha whisper the blade  travis well look hey so i have an idea right someone mentioned that the white dragon is very  vain and very savage hes got like all those wyverns around him thats a little bit of a bitch  for us were usually good one dragon on all of us you got a whole gang worse for us so what  about if we played to his vanity and maybe sent him knocking on one 
none	 of his conclave brothers  doors maybe start a little beef that maybes not there  sam how do we do that  travis i dont know the idea just popped up im looking for your help and shit  liam hes a big picture man heres the detail fellow  travis you know how tired i am right now  laura were so tired  taliesin i think that weve been thinking about this the wrong way i think that weve been  treating this as a battle and we have to start treating this like a war which 
none	 is a very  different creature  sam are we guerrillas  taliesin we are absolutely not  liam beret  travis wolverines  taliesin we need to reinforce this city not as a final stand but as a place where there might be  survivors because if they come here theres no battle to be fought its just a loss  laura we need to take it  marisha elsewhere  matt at this point jarett steps out from back of the room and says the more time that goes by  the more chance there is that the 
none	 battle the war will be fought here on our turf the faster we  move the better chance we have of bringing it to theirs so let us not dillydally  marisha you mentioned about having our own mole at one point our own inside man  travis yeah scanlan  sam im not going to volunteer myself as a slave to the dragon  travis keep thinking about it  liam you are a sexy dinosaur  sam im considering it  travis youll be the hercules mulligan of vox machina  all hercules mulligan  taliesin i would 
none	 like to talk to some of the magic users about installing some sort of or  perhaps helping me install a nonmagical dragon raid signal so that the population knows to be  quiet and knows to quietly go underground in the event of the next flyby  matt they all look at each other and gilmore nods thats actually i wouldnt say  rudimentary but its definitely within my skill set  taliesin would triggering it possibly alert them to our existence does it make holding up the  shield  matt not if i can maintain it underneath 
none	 the barrier  sam does the barrier block sound and visuals  matt it should  sam and is there any way that we can help you make this barrier more permanent and stronger  matt i dont know this was crafted for this reason this isnt a long standing existing  incantation this was crafted through the minds of drake thunderbrand and allura and myself and  pikes aid this is a new magic its experimental and to be perfectly honest im very  glad it succeeded because i was  laura just guessing  matt essentially  liam 
none	 also gilmore as a sidebar what about that black ball beneath the city has anything been  learned of it  matt weve been a bit distracted  liam thats what i thought  taliesin i would like to put it to use  laura wait what  taliesin were at war  laura we cant move it  taliesin were not going to move it  sam were going inside it  taliesin i want to put the private council table in the room with it  sam in the room where it happens  laura so they cant 
none	 scry into the room it cancels all magic  taliesin so no glamor will survive no magic will survive no trick can be allowed  matt i love your mind percy have i told you that i love your mind i love it  taliesin thats probably a bad sign but thank you  matt well do that immediately it sounds like a grand plan  asum says not a worry well do that immediately  sam well just have to seeker asum that it happened  laughter  taliesin we should move quickly we should pick a couple of 
none	 vestiges and move quickly collect them  start finding more allies move quickly but we should not dally too long  marisha and i agree we might not be able to wait to get them all before we start taking on dragons  we might want to do both  matt jarett says if youre looking to go to the ozmit sea youll probably need a ship of some  kind its quite a far travel and that distance as well and the docks on the west coast right now  are well theyre locked down at emon  taliesin 
none	 could cabals ruin  laura how long is the travel to marquet  matt travel by boat across the ozmit maybe about a week a week and a half skyship maybe  half as long  sam airship airship airship  matt gilmore actually steps in and is like technically i have a teleportation sigil outside  the city i could probably just get you there  sam wait to go to where marquet  liam walking is really good for the health though  marisha and first level characters which we are not  sam hold on before we 
none	 decide that marquet is the thing  taliesin its cabals ruin correct were going to search for cabals ruin  travis are we at all just forgetting the fact that draconia is lying in ruins  taliesin we dont have time  laura no its not about time the dragon is sitting on top of draconia  sam so we know where to find him to kill him  laura unless we know how to take on that dragon we cant save anyone  sam weve killed dragons before  taliesin i will feel better with one or two more 
none	 vestiges in our pocket  liam by the skin of our teeth scanlan by the skin of its gut  taliesin we got lucky  sam i like grogs idea is there a way to explore that any further  marisha pitting the dragons against each other  sam yes  taliesin i think its a great idea worth exploring  liam seeker asum is on it he said that he was going to  sam seeker asum is great but were the best in the business i wouldnt leave our plan a to  someone not us  laura 
tavern	 seeker asum is telling people that this city has been magicked away  matt asum is also still at the table  marisha yeah hes right there  taliesin were drunk we will talk about you  in third person as much as we want  laura were just reiterating the things that you told us you were going to say  matt thats all right  taliesin we figured you would speak up if you had issue  laura plus its really fun to say your name  matt never heard it before i assure you  travis how 
none	 far away is draconia from here travel wise  matt well my usual travel to wildemount is across the northern channel here id say youre  looking at about two weeks of travel by ship across the lucidian ocean  marisha or we can always teleport i can tree stride i can always tree stride  sam have you been to draconia  marisha i can scry and look at a tree  matt tree stride is a short distance you mean transport via plants  marisha whatever they all sound the same i can scry look at a tree 
none	 and then we go through that tree  sam if theres any trees left  laura theres definitely at least  marisha im hoping theres a tree on that continent  liam are we talking though about how scrying is a little dangerous right now  marisha when youre scrying on dragon  laura when youre scrying on a tree  marisha yeah the tree doesnt know its being spied on  travis doesnt draconia have an army there if there are any survivors anyone we can bring back  to whitestone shouldnt we be accumulating those people  taliesin 
town	 i think if theres a dragon sitting on top of them removing people from him is  travis were sneaky were so sneaky  laura are we sneaky  travis yeah pikes not even here  laura you have your memories of the feywild do you remember sloshing around in that black sludge  very loudly  marisha do you remember us walking into the town center to kill kevdak that wasnt sneaky  travis no no that was personal  taliesin grog i think youre thinking of a battle we can win as opposed to a war were  
none	 losing  travis yeah no look im not trying to pick a fight with a dragon im just going to make sure  that dragonborn are there and we can help them  taliesin we can help them by killing the dragon  liam yes  travis wow  taliesin vax is agreeing with me  matt actually thats pretty sound if you manage to defeat the dragon there youll probably gather  the survivors and have them join the cause against emon if you have means of transporting them  remember once a dragon is down its  laura 
none	 its on  matt its on  sam grog is the best thinker  marisha yeah we pull the trigger on one we pull the trigger on all of them  laura i cant believe if we fight one that means we have to fight  travis well listen again im not trying to kill the white dragon  taliesin what is the white dragon going to do  travis i want him to go pick a fight with the other dragons  laura how are we going to do that though  liam were working on that as a 
none	 side venture what are we going to do there to make that  happen  marisha we cant really stroll up to it and be like  travis you guys dont know how to pick a fight you honestly cant brainstorm one way to pick a fight  marisha we are very good at picking fights its getting the dragons to pick fights on others  sam we can probably plan a ruse  laura oh and how would you do it grog  travis i would talk mad shit to the white dragon on behalf of the green dragon 
none	 i would rep the  green dragon  laura oh my god grog he will never see through that thats brilliant  liam you are really strong thats the end of it i have nothing else to say  travis im just saying i feel like an opportunitys being wasted here  taliesin i think an opportunitys being tabled briefly  marisha weve got to think about it  taliesin i dont think this is nearly as time sensitive  travis fine someone else do the thinking  marisha breeding hostility between the two is something that could take weeks 
none	 which we dont have  taliesin well we could start it its also something other people can do while we do other things  liam yes delegate  marisha but how it literally involves going to one dragon and saying hey did you hear what that  other dragon said about you thats all i got  taliesin well there are other ways to do it in traditional warfare you can do things like cause  damage to the property of one dragon and leave scant evidence that the other dragon or one of  the dragons people was somehow 
none	 responsible have a raiding somehow get wyverns to raid near  marisha wait hang on that first thing you said  taliesin yes its the easiest level  marisha i think i might have an idea okay we know the white dragon is vain  laura right we know that  matt all dragons to an extent are vain its part of the nature of the chromatics  sam white dragon loves the thrill of the hunt  matt the white dragon is the most comparably primal theyre all in various stages of  hyperintelligence the white dragon is the 
none	 one thats the most beastlike  taliesin if the white dragon is a hunter the easiest way to incite damage is to sneak into the  city and start mauling and killing draconians that are left over and just leaving bodies everywhere  that he wasnt responsible for  marisha what  taliesin that is the sort of decisions were going to start having to make  laura what if somebody can polymorph into a little green dragon or something  marisha yeah you went to 11 there on lets start continuing the genocide  laura fuck shit up as 
none	 a dragon and leave evidence behind as a green dragon  sam ive seen the green dragon raishan  matt you have seen the dragon  sam how big  matt gargantuan and you cannot polymorph into dragons you can only transform into beasts  sam i understand  matt fairly large yeah id say probably raishan is the smallest of the dragons you saw  but even at the smallest of them is still a good 30 feet to the shoulder  sam i could do that  liam gather all the papiermâché you have in the city  
none	 sam i could do something pretty close to that  travis i bet you could do a lot of incredible things  sam are you tony robbins  laughter  taliesin i think this is a conversation that can continue through marquet i dont think were  going to come up with the best idea tonight  marisha but we need to get something started heres what we learned  sam at dawn  marisha at dawn we drink some more we learned that thordak is enslaving sculptors to build his  image all around emon what we have learned 
none	 is it seems that each of the dragons have picked a city  a domain maybe this domain was part of the bargain to join thordaks cause help me you get  your own city  taliesin a reasonable and astute observation yes  marisha so i bet the white dragon would be real pissed off if statues of thordak started popping  up around draconia  laura or the green dragon  marisha or the green dragon  travis or maybe even statues where umbrasyls nest was  taliesin lets pick a dragon  laura vorugal is the white 
none	 dragon  sam raishan is the green heres the problem with goading vorugal the white to find and kill raishan  the green no one knows where raishan the green is including vorugal  laura how do you know vorugal doesnt know  sam because raishans the shapeshifter and no one knows where she is including gilmore whos  been scrying for a week to try to find her  laura yeah but the white dragon might have some way to communicate  travis do we know how they communicate  liam yes we do there were some baubles in 
dung	 a wall in kriegs secret cave  laura they have other balls right  travis gilmore asum do either of you have a theory on how they communicate  matt gilmore looks to asum i have not been to any of their bases asum youve been watching thordak  he looks back within his domain in the cloudtop he has apparently an overhead airplane  laura its very loud  matt trust me it was strange he has a number of various spies that are sworn to him that act as  his network of information to and from the 
none	 cloudtop and his throne of black glass and molten  rock he does have singular pillars placed around that contain four orbs that he would speak into on  occasion  marisha and didnt we see something similar in umbrasyls and when we killed the blue  laura we saw orbs in umbrasyls  marisha yeah remember it cracked and it was like im coming for you and we were like we  dont know what that means and we ignored it  laura that was in brimscythes  liam did we see that in the black  travis they 
none	 were broken already  matt yeah they were already shattered  laura he shattered them fuck  sam why did he shatter them  laura so that we wouldnt be able to scry on anyone else or he was pissed  sam he was pissed at the other dragons maybe  liam but its not safe to assume asum sorry that theyre not in communication we have to  assume that they are im so sorry  matt its all right its not like my childhood friend purvon  laughter  taliesin there is a thought this is a very 
none	 good idea youve got a very good idea  sam whats the idea  marisha i said we start planting statues of thordak or raishan in other dragons territories  ultimately though what we need is we need someone who knows the dragons weaknesses we need  to know what pushes their buttons  sam we know what pushes their buttons  taliesin we need to know what pushes the reset button why am i speaking in video game metaphor  liam what  taliesin nothing drink  sam we can throw up some statues and cause some havoc but 
none	 if they have these orbs that  communicate with each other then the white can call thordak and say hey whats up with these  statues and thordak can say no its not me  taliesin not statues idols small images of the white dragon for worship  liam youre gambling on jealousy  taliesin start hiding them in places if we start seeding them especially in emon as if he is  trying to get people to worship him in other cities as well silently quietly underneath  sam well make tshirts that say team vorugal  taliesin we 
none	 just have to make sure that we dont use the stone from here  marisha well because we know that thordak is definitely vain  taliesin and this will piss him off and if he says what are you doing i dont know anything  about this  laura yeah he would deny it of course he would deny it  marisha and were assuming sorry that theyll ask instead of jumping to conclusions  taliesin i like it  laura even if he jumps to conclusions he would be pissed  sam but we know that thordak is a 
none	 total asshole sorry  laughter  sam so we know hell be pissed off more or less  matt his scarred eye twitches for a moment  marisha and we wonder why people hate us  matt asum leans into the conversation and goes we have many crafters and artisans that are  within the grasp of the clasp as well within emon we can begin to have these made and  scattered throughout the various offerings brought to the center of the city  taliesin little shrines hidden in ruins  matt i like this  marisha hashtag team 
none	 vorugal  matt we can make this happen you can make that happen hashtag team vorugal  taliesin i still will admit that cabals ruin is one of the vestiges i feel would be and not just  because i would like to use it  marisha is ankharel and the ozmit sea in the same area can we hit one on our way to the  other  matt the ozmit sea is in between taldorei and from your perspective its taldorei and marquet  and the ozmit sea is whats in between  taliesin so we could do 
none	 a triple  marisha we could do a triple because i have to get to the water ashari at some point  taliesin and thats very important because we need them on our side  sam between what and what  taliesin ozmit sea so its over here  sam its between what and who  matt the ozmit sea is between marquet and taldorei  sam is this taldorei  marisha were on taldorei  sam so marquet is japan  matt more australia  sam got it is this world round can we go the other way  
none	 taliesin actually this world is shaped like a d20 so were on the flat part at the five  sam cant go the other way  matt you could eventually get there it is round  laura would i know how fast dragons can actually fly if its a twoweek trip to get to draconia  from where we are  matt two weeks via ship ocean ship  laura okay if they were flying how fast could they get there potentially  travis im only saying maybe its empty right  marisha what is  travis draconia  matt 
none	 im going to make some mathematics here if youll excuse me  travis im only saying if they were just here  sam but we could bamf there right now  laura check it out and get out before they get back  travis get people out do recon whatever  sam and marisha plant some seeds  laura theyve probably left a good amount of army there to keep people under control wed have to  get in and out in a couple of hours  sam and what would our mission be  liam dump a couple of 
none	 statues  laura we dont have them  taliesin let other people do that  sam wait what about instead of dumping statues we find these orbs we find his lair we find his  orbs and we call thordak and we do a voice like yo thordak youre a dickhead im going to come  kill you or we just smash them  taliesin i dont know why everyones so excited about the notion of pissing off the dragons to the  point at which they all come here but it is a way to go  sam they 
none	 dont know were here  taliesin they know were here  travis im just pointing out an opportunity where there is one  sam thats true  matt a few days  laura it would take them a few days to get there  travis a few days we would have a whole fucking day  marisha what time is it  matt at this point in time its midafternoon evening  sam we have to rest  liam percival even just for intelligence even if it was brief even to see what is going on there  taliesin we 
none	 have to make sure that we can get out immediately and we also have to agree that if  things start looking too iffy we run  marisha i have an idea  sam you have the best ideas  marisha thank you  sam lay it on me  marisha can you seeming us to all look like lizard army members  sam tomorrow and well look like us except vaguely like lizard people  travis why not wyverns  sam first of all the lizard army is that different from wyverns so theyre just scaly  creepers i 
none	 can do that  laura have you seen the lizard people  sam no but ill see them when we get there  laura okay  matt youve come across a few of the lizardfolk they attacked you in emon they were on the  wyverns theyre humanoid theyre a little larger than one of your halfelf companions or percy  marisha we fought them on the airship too right  matt no those were bandits you fought wyverns  sam we could be lizard people for sure  laura wait what  taliesin we could look like lizard people 
none	 and it would trick anybody who wasnt a dragon and if  the dragon came we would be fucked that would be the end that would be game over  sam singing we could be lizard people  taliesin im going to go on record as saying i do not think this is the right move  liam what do you think is the right move  sam he wants to go to marquet to find some cloak that may or may not help us in a week  taliesin will help us getting three more vestiges two more vestiges 
none	 just a little bit  more power before starting to play chess again  laura really the only point of going there would be reconnaissance thats it no fighting  travis when else are we going to know for sure  taliesin theres an ancient dwarven saying and im trying to remember where i heard it but it  goes somewhere along the lines of its never a threehour tour thats my fear  travis yeah i know an ancient dwarven one that says no risk  sam thats it  taliesin your mind is a grandfather clock you know 
none	 that  travis thank you  taliesin its correct twice a day easily  sam if we go what is our mission  taliesin thank you  marisha to get as many innocents out as we can  laura no that sounds wonderful but if we get people out theyre going to know something  happened  marisha i figured if we find good fighters once again and do our tree our teleport thing  sam we can get 13 people out thats it  marisha but it could be the 13 people that could change the tide  taliesin 
none	 this is not going to be a fight of 13 people  sam we had a group of 50 goliaths and they were all killed instantly  marisha thats what im saying  laura plus if were lizard people the survivors arent going to be wanting  taliesin theyre going to be wondering who we are first off  laura theyre going to be afraid of us  sam i would only want to go there if we had a distinct plan to disrupt or trick or steal  travis disrupting communications is a great tactic  taliesin were not 
none	 going to be able to disrupt communication  travis you dont think were going to make it to the jewels and smashysmash  taliesin no  marisha i dont think thats a good idea  sam and i slice the dragons throat and i say i am victorious  liam that sounds like a plan lets go  matt so what are you guys doing  taliesin tightening up were going to go what are we going for  sam smash the orbs  marisha well heres something else i want to put into perspective if i scry and teleport 
none	 us to the  black dragons lair i can do one more scry and then i would burn my seventh level spell to get us  there again and then id be tapped out  laura so we wouldnt be able to bamf out  marisha we wouldnt be able to bamf out that day wed be staying the night  sam but i can get us a safe place to stay for the night no matter where we are  taliesin but it means this is not a oneday this is a threeday mission  marisha i could not 
none	 teleport us it depends on how many times ive got two teleports so i can  teleport us there and teleport us out but wed be doing it from here  taliesin we teleport to the black dragons lair we sleep overnight teleport in teleport out and  then sleep overnight teleport either to whitestone or to marquet  sam can you teleport today or are you done  matt you can only use that once per day though right  marisha i used plane shift i didnt use transport via plants yes wait no i moved  earth i 
none	 cant do it today it has to be tomorrow and if thats the case its tomorrow then we  lose that twoday grace period unless we go right now and sleep overnight in draconia and start  first thing in the morning  taliesin and risk a very reasonable reason that they would know where we are  matt as far as i know plane shift cant teleport you on the same plane it brings you specifically  to another plane of existence  marisha yeah im saying i cast plane shift from the feywild to here thats all im 
none	 saying but i  used that and thats a seventh level spell  sam so if we go to draconia tonight if we want to sleep in the mansion we cant because i  changed his memory  laura oh fuck  sam so we would have to sleep out in the open as lizard people  laura nope  liam too many negatives now  laura this is danger zone  marisha were getting a lot of cons theres not so many pros  taliesin we need to sleep anyway because were exhausted  travis oh man i can 
none	 find all sorts of problems with a situation if i look hard enough  taliesin that is so astute its 1200 my god he had a thought  travis opportunity honestly theres a dragons perch and he is vacated and it will probably  never happen again as far as we know  taliesin i disagree i think the next time they come to attack and kill us it will be vacated  travis cool while theyre killing whitestone because we didnt take advantage of this moment  then well go to draconia  taliesin i agree i legitimately agree 
none	  laura we can sleep and wake up in the morning and teleport there  taliesin we do have to sleep regardless theres no getting around sleep  laura we cant fucking go there when we havent slept grog well all die  taliesin we cant actually get there right now  marisha theres also no guarantee that theyre going straight back there maybe theyre heading  somewhere else they were heading with an army to somewhere its probably not a city theyve  already conquered  taliesin they were heading southeast  matt southeast is what you saw yes 
tavern	  sam thats where they live  taliesin so theyre probably heading back home  marisha balls then where did they come from what were they doing  liam they were fishing  taliesin they thought that we might be here and they took a quick look around which is why i  dont want to make any more noise around here  sam lets sleep  taliesin im going to go to the barkeep  matt there is no barkeep here this tavern has been opened just for you guys to be served there  is no current owner 
none	 here most everyone who helped you open this are yourselves and a couple of  civilians that were just there  taliesin is there a civilian waitress  matt there is no waitress there are a couple civilians outside but as soon as you guys started  talking all the civilians left the room  laura theyre so nice  taliesin theres no barmaid at all  liam your nobility is showing percival  sam i need a young boy  laughter  liam these white gloves are sullied i need a new set of white gloves please  taliesin 
none	 theyre shooting mittens and youre so uncouth  sam i have an unseen servant do you need a servant i make an unseen servant for him  matt theres a wisp of air  sam command him as you see fit  taliesin never mind this is what i get for trying to be nice to anybody ive learned my  lesson  sam i tip the unseen servant  matt you toss the coin and it clinks to the ground  travis i pounce on it  matt you soft impact into this weird cluster of air its pushing 
none	 your beard hair back and your  mouth is full of all that air pushing into it as you reach into the unseen servant grab the coin  and pull it out  travis yeah  matt well done you got a gold  taliesin well sleep for now well wake up in the morning and well either go in one direction  or the other  laura good plan guys good plan  marisha we came up with nothing  taliesin thats so not true we came up with a lot we just have to sleep and then make 
none	 a  decision based on what the world looks like in the morning  liam dream about a cloak percival maybe we can get you a cloak  taliesin that cloak sounds useful  marisha all right lets sleep lets go to the castle  matt you guys find your way to the castle  taliesin as a side i want to grab vex for a quick walk on the way to the castle i want to go  by the cemetery has it been worked on by the way i suppose ill find out  liam you did say 
none	 vex right  taliesin vax  liam you said vex  taliesin vax ive been drinking ive not even been drinking ive been pretend drinking  matt all right you grab him  taliesin i have something to show you  liam what is it  taliesin youll like it well i dont know if youll like it i dont know what you like im  going to take him to the cemetery to the crypt the title i gave your sister doesnt come with  much but it does come with one at the moment tiny plot of land 
none	 on which a crypt sits this was  the resting place of the father and grandfather and assorted family members of the man you killed  the first night we came here  liam you want my sister to live in a mausoleum  taliesin no i want something else to live in a mausoleum this is actually for you open it i go and i  light the two little torches on the side this is very traditional and it should open do you trust me  liam uh  taliesin good answer ill go in first  matt 
none	 percy enters the building  liam i follow  matt okay as you enter the mausoleum the gentle flickering of torchlight that was lit by percy  shows the interior though it is lowlit partially and your darkvision does catch you  what was once a relatively decent mausoleum seems to have been gutted retrofit and now you see  standing before you is a mostly constructed shrine to the raven queen  taliesin i figured it would be a good idea ive had my fill of gods but im not so foolish to  think that we do not 
none	 need them still this is here when you need it  liam i am having trouble  taliesin me too i do not want to die who i am i would like to live long enough to be someone  else i think you understand that  liam ive been really angry at you  taliesin ive been encouraging it  liam i dont know if its entirely fair but i cant shake it i dont know that im willing to  let go of it yet  taliesin good i certainly do not deserve it yet i dont know 
none	 if i ever will but i cant think of  anything else to do with my time on earth right now other than this i am finished with gods  they will not help me maybe you will  liam percy  taliesin yes  liam ive always liked you from the beginning ive always liked you  taliesin ive always liked you too  liam you are intelligent and charming  taliesin thank you  liam and good in a tight spot  taliesin its the open spaces where i suffer the tight spots i feel very good about 
none	 its the open  spaces this is a very tight spot  liam i would like to be friends with you again i just have a condition  taliesin yes  liam my penchant for forgiveness with my sisters welfare is razor thin  taliesin i know  liam if you can respect that then we dont have a problem  taliesin do you know why i titled your sister  liam i have some idea  taliesin she thought she was missing something that and i use this term loosely ordinary  people we have a magic we use 
none	 to convince people that we deserve the things we get those of  us who were born this way it was treating her unfairly and limiting her ability to see her world  for what it was worth and it was a simple and easy fix she is going to wake up one morning  not yet but soon and realize that money will not make her happy and that trying to please that  awful father will not make her happy the first step in that is realizing that hes weak and  theres no better way to do 
none	 that than being better titled than your parents  liam i dont agree with that line of thinking  taliesin i know but you are not her and im not saying its the truth but it is what i believe is  in her heart i think perhaps that might lift i will never hurt her i will never hurt anybody  intentionally especially not you any more than i already have in return i ask never take your  eyes off me never trust me and that is the best friend that you can be  liam i will

town	 need to take care of  which you know and i hope you will help me with it but i do not take your gift lightly you have  me i close the door again and head back to town  matt back into town you guys quietly keep your distance in your walk find your way back to the  castle to your respective rooms and an evenings rest takes you all  marisha do i hear vax go to his room  matt are you waiting to hear vax go to his room  marisha im waiting to 
none	 hear vax go to his room  matt actually knowing vax you wouldnt hear anything  laughter  liam 30  matt you wait for a long time and no sound comes to your ears  marisha i go to sleep  matt all right and with that as you guys rest for the night were going to take a quick  bathroom break well be back here in a few minutes we had a friend come and deliver a gift  to laura which you can see presented on the table now it is a replica that someone kiki 
none	 day made  this awesome prop replica of fenthras  laura i wish you guys could see it up close obviously were going to send a picture on  twitter so you guys can see it but it lights up different colors  matt design based on david rodriguezs concept art for fenthras  laura its got elvish for protector and growth  matt thats so badass  laura did i say it right protector not protection protector is right  marisha protector and growth  laura say what  matt that is awesome  laura thank you so much 
none	  matt thank you kiki  laura youre unbelievable  travis should we put it down  matt all right there we go  laura lean it up against the table  matt so as you guys come to consciousness the next morning the storm has come in now  laura by the way i got terrible sleep i replayed everything saundor said in my head a  hundred times  matt make a general wisdom saving throw  liam youre paralyzed from fear  laura i am terrible wisdom saving throw 12  matt 12 okay your evening is 
none	 hardpressed you do manage to get a full nights sleep you do not  suffer any exhaustion you do manage to get rest though the nightmares do come in memory of your last  encounter at the feywild and saundors words still swimming around in your head finding cracks  in your sense of self but you still are stalwart against the choice you made and the friends that  were at your back and as you all come to consciousness the sound of rain outside of the  castle against the exterior stone greets you with the morning you 
none	 can smell the fresh rain in the  air and eventually come down to find breakfast prepared a meal earned  taliesin not chicken  matt not chicken no this is eggs fruits a classic whitestone breakfast chicken is  available but strangely untouched  laura baked beans tell me theres baked beans  taliesin the thick singleslab bacon  liam blood pudding  marisha basically an irish breakfast  matt there are a few farms here most are in the surrounding fields south of the city its good  its fresh  taliesin the rain is good it will 
none	 mean that theyll have an easier time figuring out the water  level while theyre digging out beneath the sun tree and making sure that its secure i love this  weather  sam well to marquet or to draconia whats it going to be should we vote  taliesin an attempt at an object of power or an attempt at friends in power  sam which is which  taliesin draconia has friends in power  marisha speaking of friends we should probably check up on ours  taliesin long sigh that is true we havent heard anything but 
none	 that is true  marisha we havent heard anything about him  laura its terrifying  marisha i know  sam hes probably okay  travis who are we talking about  laughter  sam jarett  travis oh  sam our only friend in draconia  taliesin i personally would assume that tiberius would either be on his way to one of the two  cities if he were so inclined and if he had survived and if he wasnt working in the city  itself to keep it functioning  marisha hes hardheaded enough so all of those 
none	 things are very true  taliesin and again were at war this is not a battle we do not win by going to draconia we do  not win by going to marquet we win months from now  marisha youre starting to make less and less sense percy  taliesin no im making perfect sense  liam part of the traditional whitestone breakfast is  laura a rambling de rolo  taliesin breakfast needs things to live  laughter  liam i think you got that backwards  sam whitestone continental breakfast two eggs rambling tirade  laughter  
none	 laura vote then  liam vote  taliesin im all right with a vote  sam all right all in favor of going to marquet to find a vestige that will maybe give us some  more power that we need to kill a dragon say aye  taliesin and liam aye  sam all in favor of going to draconia where we dont really have a great plan but i think were  going to go try to fuck up a dragons lair and maybe rescue five people and probably die as  lizard people say aye  laura 
none	 travis and sam aye  marisha aye  laura ive changed my mind i want to go to marquet now  sam three to three  laura sorry oh shit i didnt mean to fuck that up trinket whats your vote  taliesin hold on lets see if ashley texts in the next ten minutes  matt three versus three are you going leave it up to the dice being a game of dnd  sam lets do it  marisha wheres that coin we have  taliesin i have it i have it right here yeah  liam you 
none	 could also do one to ten and 11 to 20  taliesin one or 20 ready  sam wait were just doing one flip  laura yeah  sam no what  taliesin yes its flipped  laura what is what  marisha okay 20 is marquet and a one is draconia  sam what about all the other numbers  taliesin theres only two its a coin  matt 20 marquet one is draconia  taliesin and any other number we stay home  laura what is it  taliesin were going to draconia and were going to see 
none	 if we could find tiberius  sam oh god  laura let it be known i dont think we should go as lizard people anymore  travis why  laura i think we should go as ravaged draconians  taliesin i think we should go as draconians  marisha we can make ourselves look like dragonborn with seeming  taliesin i think thats a better plan  laura at least that way theyll trust us  taliesin we dont have to teleport to the middle of nowhere well we do need to get farther away  from here is there 
none	 any way to get farther away from where we are right now before we  liam can we get back to umbrasyls lair i thought that was a good idea  sam we could go there and there and back  taliesin well as long as we commit to 24 hours in draconia no matter what  marisha we can go to umbrasyls lair but itll take an extra day because i can only teleport us  so many times  taliesin i think 72 hours is a perfectly reasonable amount of time to dedicate to this  prospect  
none	 laura pop in scry pop into draconia look around and next day pop out can we do that  sam yep  liam if we stop at umbrasyls lair is there anything we can do to run grog out like a  labrador im worried about him not getting enough playtime in  sam in draconia  liam no in the mansion can you bamf up anything for him in the mansion  sam youre talking about tonight  liam no were going to go camp somewhere for a day right  laura no were going to draconia  liam 
none	 right now  sam go to the black dragon lair then go to draconia then spend a night there  liam ive been travelling with these fuckers for years and i still dont understand magic  marisha hold on a second we have two choices if were going to draconia we can either go to  umbrasyls lair to scry from there then teleport there which means we will be staying the night in  draconia  sam in draconia  taliesin and marisha in draconia  marisha or we go to draconia right now blindly and then id still 
none	 have a spell to get us out  sam but they could track us back here  laura how can we go there blindly if you dont know where a tree is  marisha well id scry  sam and then theyd know where we are  marisha they could theoretically if we get caught  laura we would only scry on a tree we wouldnt scry on a dragon  taliesin i have a compromise  sam actually can i just throw this out the only thing that would detect us scrying is currently  flying over the ocean 
dung	 we can scry right now  taliesin lets scry from the giants cave outside the city  laura itll still take a couple of hours to get there though  taliesin couple of hours to get there its fine its nine its seven  laura its 500 in the morning  taliesin its 3am why are we awake  matt youre still drunk somehow  taliesin we get far enough outside of the city so at the very least  sam to the giants lair to scry  matt north of the city up into the beginning stages of the 
none	 alabaster sierras you find the  abandoned fortress that is there embedded on the side of the mountain wall keyleth you are  attempting a scrying spell what are you scrying on  marisha okay i have the map of draconia let me just see if i can scry  sam you know what you know in draconia do you know what you know in draconia you know  tiberius and you know his armor and you know his objects and personal effects  marisha no we dont know if hes in draconia  taliesin we may end up somewhere 
none	 random  sam thats true but what do you know what is in draconia  marisha i know of the things that tiberius has told us  sam do you know any of his friends or his family have we met his family  matt you have not met his family youve never been there  marisha i dont need to have a known location  right i can just scry in a general area yeah  matt you need generally a creature of some kind  sam what about his little pet  laura are you not scrying on 
none	 a tree  liam lockheed  marisha lockheed has a higher chance of being dead than tiberius  taliesin i think thats underestimating or overestimating i dont know  liam its a coin flip  taliesin its a coin flip really hes small  marisha well this could answer our question if i cant find anybody then we might be going to  marquet  sam thats true  taliesin go for it then see what happens  marisha i guess its tiberius then hes all i got its got to be someone that i know it  cant be 
none	 something ive heard about  matt it can be something youve heard about a person or a creature  taliesin a person or a creature not a place  matt not necessarily no  taliesin can it be a magic object  matt it would be a creature of some kind  travis we know about tiberius we know about kruvanis stormwind  sam we know of lockheed  liam the mending wheel a creature only oh shit fucking magic  laura thats what he just said  marisha are we gambling on tiberius being there  sam youre going 
none	 to gamble on tiberius  marisha i am gambling on whoever we scry to because they could all be dead  sam how many times can you scry  marisha theoretically four times  laura ive also got a scrying stone  taliesin start with the stone  marisha thats right youve got that goddamn thing give me the stone  laura here  marisha thank you  taliesin i think we should call it rock the rock  marisha it doesnt go away right  laura no its a scrying eye you can use it once a day  
none	 marisha yeah lets do this  sam start with tiberius  taliesin start with tiberius well work our way down  marisha start with tiberius  laura i was going to bring it out  taliesin no you did wonderfully  laura it was just sitting there  matt you take the object you close your eyes focusing on the memory and the life essence of  tiberius stormwind you project your thoughts into the ether the nature energies carry you into  the darkness and there is no response  sam no response  matt no response the scrying 
none	 spell finds no target  taliesin that can mean a lot of things  liam yes does that stretch across the planes  sam does it  matt generally its on the same plane of existence  sam okay what about his father  taliesin or lockheed  sam well lockheed would be with  taliesin not necessarily how many times have we found stray cats  laura its true maybe scry on lockheed  marisha can i try it will it expend another spell  matt this one will expend a spell  marisha it lasts for ten minutes 
none	 oh per spell  sam so youre burning your own spell slot  marisha yeah im burning my own spells  laura at least you got one for free  sam thanks vex  marisha it makes me very nervous  sam we should do his dad  taliesin that would be who i would kill if i were taking over the city  sam you just want to kill everybody  taliesin i do  marisha im going to try lockheed his dad could be in a place where hes being watched  matt okay so this time you 
none	 give the object back to vex and you sit down and create the ritual  space before you you sit down in the center of the stone floor of the fortress and you close your  eyes this time you send out your consciousness once more the druidic energies carry you an  extended distance in but a few moments and your vision clicks in and you see perched against a  snowcovered rock in the inside of a ravine a shivering small green dragonling alone and is  partially asleep against the stone you can see just past over 
none	 this large gaping ravine that is  the center of this portion of wildemount you can see scattered rubble covered in ice and snow  and small distant things you cant quite make out with your vision here occasionally moving through it  sam can you see any trees  marisha do i find any trees  matt make a perception check  marisha 19  matt 19 theres no visible trees in the ravine anything that would be living down there has  been from your vision here obscured by rock rubble ruined floating island and snowfall you  
none	 do see growing out of the side of the rock not far from where lockheed is perched is one  leafless small branch of a tree that extends out and as you glance up there is a very thick tree  that is currently jutting out the side of the mountain  marisha does it appear to be natural  matt it does  marisha and large enough to fit grog  matt maybe  laura jutting out the side of  matt yeah its not sitting on ground but is currently over the ravine  marisha yeah one of 
none	 those any other trees is this the biggest or closest one  matt thats all you can make out from this perspective  marisha how big is the ravine how deep is it  matt from where you can tell right now from the perspective you can see looking at lockheed its  probably a good 50foot fall before you hit a scattering of broken rock and eventually it  comes into a grade to the bottom of the ravine  travis not great  marisha not a good option  matt you guys have fallen 50 feet and been 
dung	 fine  sam someone has feather fall right no  marisha did it look like a natural cavern or a manmade cavern that lockheed was in  matt from what you can tell it looks natural  marisha like he found a little cave and is hiding  matt its less of a cave and more hes perched on this little alcove this little outcropping of  rock on the side of the ravine wall  marisha oh hes on the side of the ravine  matt on the side of the ravine  laura okay i have an idea 
none	 what if we tie a rope on something on this side and we all go out of the  rope really fast and drop down  taliesin grog first  sam should you scry one more time for the dad because bestcase scenario were in a weird  snowy ravine with no civilization around  taliesin we dont want to be around any civilization and also thats one more spell gone  matt you did see distant blurred from your perspective since the focus of the scry was on  lockheed you did see movement and very small distant objects 
none	 within the snow at the base of the ravine  laura they could potentially see us as soon as we come out of the tree  sam yeah well be far away  marisha they could be citizens they could be creatures i just saw movement of figures i  didnt see any details  sam seems like a good plan  laura this is risky  marisha this is ridiculous  taliesin its true theres only risk at this point is this the risk we make or is this not the  risk we make grog  travis oh 
none	 are we asking for grogs opinion now  taliesin only so that we can ignore it  laura youre the one that was most adamant about us going there  taliesin with the new data how do you feel  travis i think we should take the hint and not go  sam but you said  travis yeah but i was picturing meandering out of a nice beautiful tree in a forest  sam its a little jolt its a little fall its fine  liam thats it he created this idea and hes backing out  sam you 
none	 told us your famous phrase all risk thats what this is  travis i do hate to have my own words used against me  sam all risk thats what this is we are doing all risk  travis im down to party im just saying it was a little different in my head  sam ive never known you to be a coward grog  taliesin no why would you do that  laura why scanlan  travis ill go first you hold my hand and ill go first  liam he can play the fiddle very well  
none	 travis ill go lets do it im ready  laura okay before we go through im going to cast pass without a trace on us so we can stealth  through the tree like thats going to work  taliesin no thats a good idea  laura im going to look for something very solid are there trees around us that we can go through  right now  matt a short walk you could get down to the base of the forest  laura all right im going to tie the rope off onto a very sturdy thing next 
none	 to a tree that  were going to go through  taliesin were going to rappel  laura yes  travis does the portal only close after a couple seconds  taliesin yes six seconds were all going to hold on to the rope and we all go  matt six seconds for all of you to  laura jump out  marisha bungeejumping out of a tree  liam we are fucking idiots  marisha this is the stupidest  taliesin this is a terrible plan i want to go on record for saying i was against this plan 
none	  sam we can just leave really quick shes got another teleport yeah were going to climb up to  the tree  marisha i didnt see draconia i saw the ravine and it was snowy so we can assume its nearby  but i didnt see draconia did i  matt youve never seen draconia before  marisha but did i see a city in my scry  matt you saw no city  laura you saw rubble  marisha once again lockheed could have flown miles away  taliesin he could have  sam at the worst this 
none	 is a quick recon mission we jump back in the tree we come back 15  minutes  laura but theres things that were crawling around amongst the dead  sam they were far off in the distance  taliesin they werent that far off but to be fair this is what a plan is is everything going wrong  so im all right with doing this if were doing this  travis all right sweet i am too  marisha all right fuck it lets do it  matt all right so youve affixed the rope at the base 
none	 of the strongest tree you can find  marisha are we going to tie ourselves to each other again like before  laura no because thats dumb were going to break our backs im going to cast pass without a  trace on everyone right now because why the fuck not  sam you got a fucking broom im hopping on the broom  laura oh yeah im on the broom and hes on the broom  taliesin vex were going to have the greatest itoldyouso if we survive this  matt all right we have vex and scanlan on 
none	 the broom  travis should you make me some something teensy  marisha oh this is such a stupid idea  taliesin no were going to need every spell we need in there no youre the weight thats going  to hold the rope down youre going first  matt any of your spell prep  liam im going to pop my wings out and hook my arms under kikis armpits  matt okay  taliesin im holding on the rope because im an idiot  matt all right grog and percy holding onto the rope  marisha this is 
none	 stupid this is so stupid  taliesin i hate you all  marisha weve done so many fucking stupid things but this is really stupid  matt vex casts pass without a trace the shadows reach around and embrace your forms you become more  obscured the further the light is from your body keyleth what are you doing  marisha i cast transport via plants on that big fatty tree  matt keyleth touches the edge of the tree the rope which is affixed to above the trunk portal opens  marisha everyone ready  taliesin and marisha go 
none	  laura i fly through stealthily  matt you fly through stealthily  laura im trying to get down to the ground quickly and hide behind something  matt right i would like all of you guys to make stealth checks at disadvantage  travis yes thats awesome  marisha oh thats not too bad  travis 17  sam pass without a trace  travis oh 27  taliesin 20  sam 20  marisha 22  liam 35  laura 33  travis 27  matt all right as vex and scanlan scoot first through the opening you 
none	 coast down and there is  a cluster of rocks but theres a light snowdust and you find a snowbank that you guys coast down  to quickly you can decide to float above the snowbank what do you want to do  laura we get down on the ground and go under  matt okay so you disappear under the snowbank it is freezing cold the wet immediately falling snow  against your form begins to seep in but you are below eyelevel vax and keyleth you guys just  dart through you holding her  liam fly through 
none	 and then once i see them hit the ground im going to divebomb us and im  going to wrap us in a little wing bubble and roll into the snow  matt all right as you guys come falling out the side of the tree you see nearby as a small  green tiny dragon gets startled and flies off you guys go coasting the wings expand for a second  it picks up and as you hit whipping past the 15 feet of jagged rocks that were gathered at the  base of the ravine you scoot over 
none	 it the wings fold in around you and you guys tumble into the  snow make an acrobatics check with disadvantage because youre grabbing onto her and are  covered in wings  laura and youre covered in wings  liam i rolled a 15 and a 20 that would be a 30  matt you dont feel the pain and the wings do cause a significant barrier of impact as well as  the snow as soon as you land you go into a classic shoulder roll and use the inertia to not  arise above the water you 
none	 both essentially coast sideways stopping within the snowbank from an  overhead perspective you can see a large swath has been carved through but from visual eye  range at equal level you guys still appear to be hidden within the snow  the two of you jump through and start rappelling down grog at the bottom end bringing the rope  bringing the rope down bringing the rope down it slams shuts the rope cuts at the other end as the  portal closes percy you just make it out as the rope gives way it is now grog 
none	 and percy  plummeting toward the ground  marisha i cast a grasping vine to grab grog  matt you dont have the opportunity because this all happens in a period of six seconds and you  guys just landed and coasted in the snow  travis am i right under percy  matt hes about five feet ahead of you yeah  travis laughs  taliesin im going to let that happen  matt youre cushioning his fall  travis yep  matt all right make an acrobatics check just for the hell of it  liam i love 
none	 this game  travis 13  matt 13 as soon as you look over your shoulder and see the ground coming you try and swing your  legs underneath to catch you to slide across and you begin to your feet catch the rock and you  feel the muscles tense your back gets jammed a little bit and you catch percy in your arms but  the momentum of percy hitting you sends you back over and you both tumble into the snow you do  prevent percy from taking any damage but you do suffer five points of 
none	 fall damage  liam stubbed your toe big guy  travis i got a booby  sam is lockheed within range still can we see him  matt you guys make a perception check  marisha can i look too  matt youre just now getting up out of the ball of wings  laura 25  sam six  laura 25  matt 25 you do see lockheed is about 50 60 feet up on the rock right now  sam wheres lockheed  laura can i whisper in draconic lockheed and whatever the word is for come to 
none	 me  matt seems too far to really be within earshot of a whisper  sam i see her doing this i point to him and i cast message and i say lockheed were down  here come down its us your friends  matt lockheed wingbeats and then glides against the rock and glides lower to the rock glides  lower to the rock and flies up still keeping a cautious distance from you above the snow  liam tibs were friends with tibs tiberius you remember us  matt you can see lockheed a little closer now you 
none	 remember him being fairly sick when he was  initially purchased while the illness has passed he looks greatly malnourished and thin  laura i pull out some of my food that i give to trinket and try to feed it  matt as soon as you pull out the food lockheeds demeanor changes immediately darts up and almost  latches onto your hand and causes you to jump  laura i cast speak with animals is he an animal  matt nope  sam i have speak with small beasts  matt not a beast  sam fuck you 
none	  laughter  liam hes a little small monster  laura i would have known as a dragon expert that hes not a fucking animal then whatever  sam what is a monster  taliesin hit your head in the fall  laura i didnt fall i flew  travis pikes a small monster  sam just grab him and put him in the bag of holding  matt at this point now the temperatures really set into you youve heard stories youre  familiar with the sound the words youve heard of wildemount being largely a colder continent  
none	 especially to the north where the actual civilizations of man exist draconias a little  further to the south but also based on the information you have this being taken recently as  the den of vorugal there is an almost perpetual small snowstorm that is existing about this  ravine and the wind itself is beginning to cut through thankfully youre mostly armored up for  the time being youre fine but you can see where this is a difficult weather pattern to perpetually  live in lockheed finishes eating vigorously and seems to be waiting across your hand 
none	  laura perch him on my shoulder and get out some more of the little boar meat we have in the bag of  colding and feeding him  matt he eats some happily  laura can i speak draconic to him see if he understands any of that  matt what do you say  liam tiberius was teaching him draconic  laura yeah i know i say where is tiberius in draconic  liam where is home  laura where is home  matt croaking  liam unless tibs got further along with him it was one word 
none	  sam he was teaching him sit and play dead and stuff  liam one word at a time  laura all right stay  matt and stays and digs in the talons at the top of your leather armor shoulder folds thed wings in  and just waits there huddled up against  your shoulder for warmth  taliesin im going to look around and see if theres a direction in which it seems theres  civilization or any signs of battle or otherwise  matt make a perception check  taliesin 16  matt 16 you bring your 
none	 head above the snowline and you can see surrounding you and you are in  the center of this giant ravine that opens up to the sky not quite grand canyon size but its  about half the width its a wide gulf and you guys are on one side of where the ravine slowly  begins to coalesce and theres various steps in which the ravine casts down you were already  towards the bottom when you landed this could have been a lot worse were it higher up  looking up you see just from this vantage point 
town	 dozens of large stacks of broken rock and stone  you see pillars that are jutting out of portions of this you see partially and mostly collapsed  buildings that themselves have been destroyed from serious impact you recall during the initial  attack of the conclave that one of the things that was seen through a vision was the fall of  draconia which were islands of stone that were held aloft through arcane means within this  ravine what you now look upon are all the fallen remains of each of these arcane islands now  plummeted crushed 
none	 and fell into the ravine and have been sundered and destroyed you do see  figures moving quickly and crawling over elements of it and you see a cluster of them fighting over  something and then disperse  liam how far off  matt theyre probably a good 300 feet off  laura could we tell what kind of creatures they are  matt they appear to be humanoid somewhat reptilian  sam should i make us lizard people  marisha can i do a nature check to see if i can see the origin the epicenter of the 
none	 storm like  the eye of the storm where its coming from  taliesin clever  marisha 16  matt 16 best that you can view the storm seems to be slowly spiraling and a large heavy portion  of the snowfall and sleet is hitting about a mile or so towards the right side of the ravine that  you guys are looking at from the wall youre at you have the right and the left sides of this  current ravine structure seems to be that direction about a mile  marisha i think the dragons lair is 
none	 that way  sam can you look around for more trees that arent so hard to get to in case we need to make a  fast getaway  taliesin we could just keep our eyes open  sam all right  marisha you said it was a mile can we traverse through the bottom of the ravine to get there in  that direction  sam or is it all water  matt no you can  travis were going to crack out the good old dust of tracelessness since theres kneehigh snow  taliesin lets not be fleshy 
none	  sam you want me to make us draconians or lizard people  taliesin if were lizard people draconians will not trust us  liam yeah we can at least pretend to cower and be afraid of lizard men if we see them  sam i dont think grog can cower  travis what is the definition of this word  sam be a wussy  taliesin shaky dance  laughter  liam you know when you bang your balls on a rock or something its like that you go groans  taliesin is there anything youre not good at 
none	 dont think that hard never mind  sam draconians  taliesin draconians  sam i will cast seeming on the party and make us all draconians  matt what kind of draconians there are many types of colors there are those with and without tails  sam wasnt tiberius a strange one  laura dont do red  sam he was a strange one right  marisha he was the odd man out  liam they didnt take kindly to him  sam metallic yeah  liam bronze  sam like gray silver  laura maybe its good to make 
none	 us silvers and whiteish  sam bronze silver and gold then i guess  liam thats chromatic metallic bronze silver gold  sam yeah well do the olympics  matt with or without tail because youve met both  taliesin they wont actually be tails that might actually get us in trouble  sam which one was tiberius  matt tiberius had a tail  sam do most of them have a tail  laura gern didnt have a tail and he was less than i dont think draconians will like us  without a tail  sam we all 
none	 have tails mines a little longer than the rest  laughter  matt keeping your normal attire just on the top of the draconian form  sam no what do draconians wear  laura rags put us in rags like weve been living in rubble  sam raw silk and tattered clothes just rags terrible gray things  laura make us look like weve been beat up  sam sure we all have a single bruise  laughter  sam in a different place on our face everyones got one face bruise in a different place  matt all of 
none	 your forms shift into that of various metallic dragonborn with tails adorned in rags  dirty what do you do  laura oh shit who all speaks draconic here  sam you speak draconic  laughter  sam were all mutes were lepers and mutes and you are our doctor  liam everybody else does fearful anime reacts the whole time  gasping  travis speaking in japanese  laura dont actually speak japanese grog  taliesin were moving towards the epicenter  matt you guys step up out of the snow and begin walking  marisha stealthily  laura 
none	 okay im stealthily leading us that direction towards where the lair is  travis keeping an eye out for trees  laura and for any of the lizard creatures coming towards us  matt right now no  laura then lets quietly make our way that direction  liam remember like youve been hit in the balls  travis oh  matt you guys cluster up and begin stepping above the snow which is still about waist kneehigh  for some of you making your way to the right of your current location towards the center of the  storm 
none	 that keyleth discovered as you guys begin to walk a nearby pile of rock and rubble there  was that one cluster of four five of these moving lizardlike entities suddenly one of them looks  at your group looks back at the rest and they all stand up and look over in your direction  sam youre our leader friend do we continue  matt theyre just watching you theyre not doing anything  laura lets injuredly keep walking  matt they go back to rummaging through you guys continue to walk the ravine curves to the right  
none	 or at least begins to open up further to the right and youre met with the next large structure of  rubble what you saw was the edge of an extremely large oncefloating island now crushed and  sundered across the ground there are sheets of ice across parts of it you can see the better  part of a large palace or library that is now caved in partially you can see frozen books  scattered across portions of the stone and rock on the ground before you you can see a series of  huts have been constructed 
none	 on top of this rubble and there are some small fires lit little plumes  of smoke and probably two dozen dragonborn figures that are currently combing through the rubble  laura do we see any books that seem interesting as were walking through them  matt theyre underneath ice you can try and chisel some out if you like  liam dont have time  matt a lot of its covered in snow theres some bits you can peek through and see sheets of ice  and frozen books  travis are there any frozen bodies  matt as 
none	 you begin to have a closer book as you walk by there are many frozen bodies you see  many people all dragonborn some atop the rubble some partially crushed some partially locked in  ice some destroyed by some sort of an acidic substance some of them are covered in boils and  their face is locked in some sort of horrible coughing fit this was a very terrifying battle  scene that has transpired here  laura that means raishan was here  marisha that means thordak was here  liam umbrasyl was here acid  marisha they 
none	 attacked the cities as a horde  matt there are no signs of anyone burned  marisha i thought you said ash  laura the people that are scouring through the rubble are those dragonborn or just the lizard  people  matt best that you can tell right now it appears to be dragonborn  laura can we look at their behavior and see what it looks like theyre doing  matt make an insight check  taliesin i would like to join that insight check  sam i would not like to  taliesin nine  liam nine 
none	  sam i will join that insight check  marisha ill join in too  matt youve already said no  laura 13 this isnt having to do with dragons so its 13  marisha i dont do insight checks too often im sorry 22  matt did you roll or not  travis oh i rolled a ten  matt best you can tell theyre surviving theyre scouring through the ruins trying to find  anything of worth some of its finding wood and throwing it onto these little flame pyres that are  scattered around the ruins you 
dung	 begin to look and see that actually the sides of the ravine there  are hundreds of small caverns are carved into the rock not quite like a dense honeycomb style but  it looks like there is an entire cave city that lives within this ravine  liam and theyre not frozen over  matt some of them are covered in snow  liam but snow not blasted with ice  taliesin they look like theyre in use  matt some of these dragonborn theyre coming out of their huts some of them are still looking up  at 
none	 the sky nervously they look over and see you guys approaching and a voice calls out who goes there  laura friends friends of stormwinds  matt friends of stormwind you say we have friends of stormwind approach  laura i walk up injuredly  liam im hobbling up behind  taliesin im cowering  matt you guys cower and approach keyleth vax and vex you notice as you approach that a number  of the people that have all stopped and are paying attention are beginning to move around and  encircle you  laura pardon my friends their 
none	 tongues have been cut out by our captors im all thats left  matt as you walk forward you can see the figure thats talking to you a very tall burly  bronzescaled dragonborn long horns that protrude down the back in a slow curvature no tail in  fact you now notice that every single one of the dragonborn youve noticed here have no tail  sam we had a 5050 chance  matt friends of stormwind that would make you skywalkers i see your tails you survive the  onslaught and step into the den of those you 
none	 persecuted well what are your last words  sam this was a great plan  liam drop it  sam i dont know whats going on  marisha is this all being said in draconic  sam its draconian i dont know whats happening  laura you know what i dont know what to tell you everyone with a tails an asshole we got  what was coming to us  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin wow  laura 19  matt he turns his head to the side a bit spits what skills do you have  
none	 laura i can shoot  matt is that all  laura he makes boots  matt thats a skill  laura shes really good at stonecraft  matt all the other dragonborn that come behind you are now holding spears some of them  rudimentarylooking pikes that are just held up and pointed in your direction you guys are now  enclosed by about two dozen dragonborn here are your choices you die here like the scum you are  laura choice b  matt then slavery it is  laughter  matt you will join the rest of your 
none	 ilk and you will seek food for us you will know what its  like to be bent beneath the knee of those who do not deserve it put them in chains  laura oh theyre going to know as soon as were in chains  liam well were going to have a fight here  laura oh shall we drop seeming perhaps we should drop seeming  sam what is it going well  laura wait  matt they approach and stop for a second a few of the folks who came over and went to grab for  
none	 chains have stopped and are holding them in their hand  laura i have to tell you something were not actually draconian  matt he leans in and gives you this very keen look now and takes a few steps closer hes about  five feet from you now from where i stand you look pretty fucking draconian to me  laura well we have some really good magic users with us look forgive us for making tails we  dont know anything about your culture were idiots we came here because we know youre under  attack and were 
none	 trying to help  matt and you just wander into the caves of the ravenites dressed in the face of those that broke  our backs  laura yep because were stupid  matt make a persuasion check with disadvantage  sam disadvantage not good  laura 14  matt 14 bring the chains you have ten seconds to prove  laura drop seeming just drop it  sam really its one of my better spells  laura i know im sorry  sam all right poof were back to normal  matt all of your images fade everyone takes 
none	 a step back the spears come up even further and  theres a little pause  marisha my tails gone bummer  laura no believe me you dont want the tail  marisha but i enjoyed it  liam does this make things better or worse for us  laura i repeat him  matt yeah the reactions you get from them you gather most of these dont speak common and none  of them seem to understand what youre saying  laura heres the thing youre being attacked by a white dragon  matt the white dragon came and 
none	 he tore down the skywalkers  laura so youre happy with it  matt well its put us in a better position  laura right but now that the skywalkers have already been torn down do you want to keep the  dragon in charge  matt we owe the dragon for the freedom that he gave us  laura so you serve one  matt for the time  laura and he doesnt punish you at all hes a good master  matt those who deserve punishment get it but we hunt with it it brings us power it 
none	 promises  expansion of the ravenites and we will no longer live under the boot of those in this countryside  and this continent  liam hows it going  laura really bad  matt we have children to feed we have families of our own  laura how can we help  matt how can you help  laura thats what were here for  matt bring us food bring us warmth chop some firewood bring some trees work  laura gladly but not in chains we do this freely  matt give us your weapons and you can 
none	 walk freely  sam lets kill them all  laura im sorry thats not happening  matt then leave  laura that we will  matt what is your business here she who wanders in the faces of others  marisha thats a cool title  laura yeah add that to the list our entire landscape is under attack now vorugal has helped  you but theyve made many others suffer not just draconians entire cities brought down for  nothing were here to right the wrong and help in any way we can  matt you should talk to 
none	 tooma  laura tooma  marisha tooma it is not a tumor  laura we knew that was going to happen  liam took about 15 seconds to fuck with matts name  taliesin i think he assumed  matt all youre doing is putting fuel on the fire  groaning  sam is it tooma  matt tooma tooma  liam thats totally different  laura who is tooma  matt tooma is our chieftain im not to make this decision come no chains for now they all  stay with their spears still out in front but they 
none	 nudge you forward  laura i explain everything thats happening in common as we walk is everyone still cool with  this were going to the chieftain  sam just tell us when its time to kill everybody  liam we improvise its what we do  taliesin i think this is actually going far better than i had hoped  sam just remember vex ticking time bomb here weve got to get in get out weve got one day here  travis are there any trees that we can see as were walking  laura they actually said they 
none	 wanted us to chop firewood so if we can get sent on that mission  were set  matt make a perception check  travis hey 19  laura are we in the mountains no are we  liam 29  matt youre in a ravine perception check was just for grog as hes the only one that asked to  look for trees but you rolled a 19  travis i did  matt looking around occasionally poking out of the rubble youll see a tree most of them seem  to have not fared so well with the 
none	 cold weather and have been snapped or broken in the process of  the falling rubble you do make out towards the edge on the other side of the ravine beyond this  giant one you can see this one island one larger island of the cluster that made up draconia fell  in the center here and is broken apart on the far end you can see theres a small cluster of trees  the hint of green still to them some of them varying thickness  marisha i could work with that  travis might be a long 
town	 way though  liam weve been here what ten minutes  matt id say about 20  sam so were going to go see tooma or were going to chop down some fucking trees  laura we have to go theyre walking us to the chieftain cant just walk away now  matt you guys are prodded along over the rubble and as you come around you can start to see where  the outside of the island is broken rock the center of it is broken structures buildings  homes giant great marble halls everything is mostly fallen in 
town	 you still see some structures  standing but at odd angles there are sections of buildings that still show the outer outline of  what once stood but it is all a complete ruin you do see every now and then a few large spikes  of ice that are jutting out of portions and you see bodies that are jabbed onto the spikes and  left to freeze  laura do they have tails  matt they do you move over the bulk of this giant pile of rubble and begin to descend the  other side and you 
town	 can see now there is an active village here that is halffrozen entirely half of  it seems to be abandoned the other half of it is completely coated in solid ice the crowd leads  you past that abandoned village to a series of tunnels against the wall maybe 300 or 400 feet  past that cluster of trees that you saw leads you into this tunnel and on the inside there are small  glow stones set in portions of the stone not naturally forming but essentially small natural  bits of torchlight just pressed into the stonework 
none	 to give some sort of a light source  youre led in for about five or so minutes and you see other offshoot tunnels its like a giant  anthill weaved throughout this and you can see rudimentary furniture made of wood and stone with  limestone rock whatevers available within the actual ravine here  marisha can i get a sense on when this was carved if this was carved recently or if this has  been here a while  matt make a nature check  marisha ooh 27  matt best you can tell from looking at 
none	 the rock and knowing the amount of erosion versus the  curvature of it these tunnels have been here for a very long time this portion opens up and you  can see now there is a much more refined villagetype structure inside maybe 30plus small  homes carved from rock and stone built much better than the makeshift huts that you saw  outside you also see a giant pile of broken chains to the left side of the entryway many of  them are manacles and neck vices that are just thrown and discarded in this large pile 
none	  marisha tiberius never mentioned this side of draconia  matt as you are brought into the center of this larger chamber you see two dozen draconians that  are out and about just currently gathering materials talking and walking and stop and see as you  enter and just watch as you pass by colors range from metallic to chromatic all spectrum its a  mishmash of all walks and sizes  liam and the chromatic the red the blue the green are we seeing tails on them  matt nope  marisha no tails  laura nobody has 
none	 tails down here  sam i could make us all draconian again without tails  laura that would probably work at this point right  matt youre led past a couple of these stone structures and there is a central open circular  plot between a lot of these theres a fountain that seems to spring a very clean source of water  within the center of this chamber beyond that there is a larger templelike square structure  that has a slight trapezoidal appearance to it the entranceway is an open arch and you can see a  large 
none	 fire burning on the inside of it  you are led around the fountain and led to the inside there sitting on a large stone seat made  of haphazard bits of rock and stone it looks relatively uncomfortable a large stone throne  there is a female dragonborn she wears long drab gray robes tattered at the edges a hood  loosely pulled back and a large scarf or wrap around her neck and shoulders she just sits there  with her hands over the side draped and as you walk in and your eyes adjust you can see 
none	 that she  looks very old as youre brought in the rest of your crew still pushes you in with the spears she  leans forward are these prisoners of ours  the dragonborn who brought you in goes they are for the time being they say they come here  because the frigid doom and other dragons who came are killing their people as well they have come  to fight the dragon or so they claim they walked in under guise of our enemy it is your wisdom to  make these choices and the larger dragonborn bows 
none	 his head and steps away the spears pull back  and they step blocking the exits that you walked through the entire archway now is shoulder to  shoulder dragonborn with spears at the ready  laura tooma we apologize for coming in the guise of your enemies unfortunately we dont know much  about your culture and no one ever informed us of what you have suffered and we apologize  matt make a persuasion check  laura 23  matt youre saying this in draconic i assume she leans in a bit and the firelight crackles  under 
none	 her chin and you can see the teeth on one side pull out beyond the lip and it gives her  this lopsided look the tongue wipes across the front and she leans in toward you you come here  to fight the frigid doom you say  laura yes  matt i would be lying if i said it did not bring a chance for freedom to all of us ravenites  laura much deserved  matt but as time progresses i fear we shake one bond to step into another the dragon presented  itself as our savior 
none	 but has since required an evergrowing fealty  laura they do that  matt without the draconians without the skywalkers and without the doom we would be  free rebuild our culture  laura i want nothing more for you than that let us help you  matt now the rest of you hear this do your friends speak common  taliesin oh thats lovely  marisha hi  sam hi yes  laura much relieved yes they do  sam grog doesnt but we do  travis moans  laughter  matt if we are to let you go 
none	 do you promise to slay this creature  laura we will do everything in our power to watch it die  liam it is our only purpose  matt it has been gone for days  laura it should be back very soon  matt took most of its army with it  sam grog was right hes always right  taliesin that was our hope that we would be able to come here when it was at its weakest and get a  sense of it  sam do you know where its lair is  matt i do 
none	  sam is it far  matt it is not far but one hour walk  laura can i roll an insight check on her  matt you may  laura 19  matt 19  sam gasps oh boy  taliesin do you know what i like as much as whispers loot crate  sam what taliesin youve got to do better than that try something like this you know matts an  asshole but you know whos not the good people at loot crate  taliesin loot crate doesnt decide to just tell one person about whats going 
none	 on they let everyone  know not just vex  sam hey you never told us what he whispered to you before  matt no he didnt  liam were good  sam oh boy  liam im a vampire just deal with it  matt if you come here to kill this dragon i assume you have the means and a plan  sam we definitely have plans  marisha totally have a plan  matt then let us set an ambush  sam ambush sorry  marisha come again  laura well we tried to do that one 
none	 other time while it did pay off and its brother is dead a  lot of people died in the process a lot very large strong people  matt so what do you insist we not have an ambush we just wait for it to land and attack headon  sam we were going to use this opportunity to find our way into its lair and find its weaknesses and plan  marisha sabotage from the inside  taliesin theres more than one dragon and they are supporting each other  marisha we kill this one itll set off a 
none	 chain reaction that we might not be able to recover from  if were not fully prepared  taliesin we want to make the means to make sure that when the time comes we can destroy them all  in one fell swoop  laura the risk here is that by destroying vorugal  sam the frigid doom  laura well bring the wrath of the others upon you  taliesin he is not the strongest  laura thordak is much larger and i dont think hes been here  matt you speak with accents i do not understand where 
none	 do you come from  taliesin everywhere  marisha were a motley crew  laura lots of different places  travis do not answer that question  taliesin we can answer the continent  laura as you can see were halfelves  matt we are to walk to the den we are to learn your information then what  taliesin set up a situation where we can monitor you and possibly contact you when its time and  even let you know if we think the dragons about to leave so that you can prepare  matt i have lived 
none	 to see this day by not being deceived or tricked you speak words that are not  direct they wind they spin they circle what guarantee do i have that you will not just flee  marisha to be fair what guarantee do we have that you wont kill us and the ambush was meant  for us i believe there is untrust on both sides  matt at which point she steps off of the throne steps on both of her feet and when shes off the  throne her imposing form becomes far less imposing you can see 
none	 now theres a very heavy  hunch to her back and as she scuffles forward shes an almost pitifullooking sight physically  as she pulls forward to walk straight to you keyleth you see the somewhat clouded  cataractridden eyes of the dragonborn female tooma she comes up to you and goes we are a  proud people even when pressed into the dirt for as many years as we have been we reclaim our  honor we reclaim our place in this world we wish to do this as peacefully as possible but we have  been forced to 
none	 scrounge and survive through this freedom we wish you no folly we wish you no ill  will but we also have learned that trust needs to be earned it cannot be spoken and given so  freely both ways you are right to mistrust as are we of you but that is the impasse one must  have faith in one way or another if there is to be a compromise  marisha i think faith and trust are not mutually exclusive i can not trust you and still have  faith and you should not feel lack of 
none	 pride for living in the dirt or surviving theres nothing  wrong with that but i understand your urge to want to rebuild become the great culture that i  know you all are so you should at least trust that we have similar interests in the end  matt make a persuasion check  marisha ooh 19  sam was that opal  taliesin yes it was  marisha opals back 25  matt 25 she reaches forward and extends a finger that gently scrapes the bottom of the chin not  too much to hurt but to go 
none	 across the skin and pull your chin upward into the light of the fire a  little bit there is much wisdom in there for so young a face all right there are not many  options we have either come we will walk and at the very least if you decide to flee never return  marisha we can give you that word  laura tooma are the frigid dooms armies around will they see us  matt there are a handful of dregs that stayed behind but you tell me you wear many faces  laura we certainly 
none	 dont want them to see ours  sam what should we disguise ourselves as  matt she points past over your head and goes tiny gnome the faces of those that lead you here  sam okay tiny is uncalled for but i understand the faces of your tribe of your clan all right  matt be glad you walk with one as wise  marisha is she talking about me thats awesome  matt she begins to shuffle over and you watch as two of the dragonborn walk over and scoop her up  shoulder to shoulder and she 
none	 shrugs them off and pushes them away i can walk myself she begins  shuffling and they separate and open she walks partway out as you guys stand there and turns  around and beckons well come  travis we follow  laura can you cast seeming again  sam i can do seeming one more time all right  laura wait if you cast seeming will we still be able to get into the  sam weve still got the mansion handicaps me a bit but i will cast seeming again on the party  and do the same 
none	 thing except slightly different colors and slightly less tail  laughter  matt the larger dragonborn that let you in  sam my tail nub is slightly larger than the rest its a cube its a tail cube  matt as the rest of the guards circle around and begin to walk a little bit of trepidation but  going along with tooma the large one who let you in goes tooma are you certain  she turns around and goes skork there are few things that are certain in this world i am not  long for it but 
none	 if we are not to seize the opportunity of kinship we miss the opportunity  for survival is it a risk yes sometimes its a risk worth taking and she keeps walking the  rest of them gather behind and the nownamed skork gives a nod and continues walking along  sam have we heard of skork  marisha is that his name  laura he was the guy that we talked to right when we got here  matt yeah you guys are led out of the tunnel back into the freezing air the wind has picked up  
none	 a bit and you can now hear this low hum as it hits certain portions of the cavern and causes low  vibrational whistles in the distance the snow has begun to fall a little heavier now and as you  walk out you can hear the crunch of your footsteps as youre stepping through heavier and  heavier blankets of snow  laura can i tell tooma as we walk out ps if that dragon comes back we need to bolt  matt she nods if that dragon comes back we never saw you you never saw us  
none	 laura thank you  matt shes very slow by the way your passage of travel is about half speed as she leads the  charge but everyone respectfully keeps in pace with her  sam tooma have you ever heard of a dragonborn named gern blanston  matt she thinks for a second that name has not come to my mind no  sam us neither  matt pushing on its gotten a little lighter in the sky you figure based on your arrival you  may have just come in at the cusp of dawn and the sun has 
none	 now gotten higher in the sky youre on  the entire opposite side of the planet now so the cycle has changed based on the location youre  currently in well you had rested actually you left in the morning you wouldve gotten here  actually opposite of that its actually now getting to dusk even though its only been a  couple of hours of daylight that youve seen since you woke up this morning its already beginning  to set and the sky is getting darker  laura we lost a day but the dragon will still take 
none	 the same amount of time  liam ugh im so treelagged though  marisha i know always sucks going west to east  matt youre led over a portion of the ravine ever so slowly that lifts up and then as you get  to the crest it bends down into a far deeper and wider portion of the ravine this is now the  center part of this entire giant physical anomaly that is this giant crack in the ground and you  can see the bulk of the fallen city is in the center of this area  
none	 laura do we see any big trees around here  matt you see a couple of larger trees that sprout out from the rubble theres ones that managed to  survive the impact of certain areas of stone though it looks like a lot of the bark has been  stripped and they might not be alive that you can see from this distance there are smaller trees  towards the edge and a few still protruding from portions of the walls  sam note every tree as we walk by  marisha yeah im paying attention to the trees 
none	 thats the biggest tree thats now closest to us  now thats the biggest tree thats now closest to us now that one  matt as youre led down into the ravine you reach this central structure and you can already  see from this distance as the snow falls hitting and covering the rocks there are dozens and  dozens of those spikes of ice jutting out of the rock each with one or two various frozen corpses  impaled on them and left at the top of this you can see a large cluster of ice that is 
none	 in a  somewhat round gathering and you can see actually no you dont see that sorry a note  that will come into play in the future  travis can i ask a question the bodies on the spikes none of them look familiar right  matt you can keep watch as you go you push towards the center of the ravine and upon the  large island of rubble you begin to move and it takes a good 40 50 minutes an hour to traverse  a lot further than you wouldve expected in that time period sorry 
none	 a lot less than you figured  you would traverse in that time being weighed down by toomas gait however the rubble begins  to subside and you begin to see steps of ice not perfect carved steps but elements of  encapsulated broken platforms of ice that act as stairs vax vex and keyleth as you guys begin  to move up the steps and you especially vex you can see with what little bit of light is  beginning to shine down through the ice you can see mounds and mounds of coins and jewel boxes and  
none	 many expensive knickknacks and collections all below feet of solid ice all clustered towards the  apex of this collapsed ruined island  laura tooma is vorugal having you collect all of this  matt vorugal sends us to pay the debt we owe for being freed yes we scavenge we spend our days  searching for food for the means to survive and finding what we can from the ruins of the broken  draconia  laura and when you cant find anything what then  matt these are the thoughts that consume me it is the reason you 
none	 are still alive everyone make  a perception check  sam yeah dog 14  marisha 28  taliesin natural 20  sam that wasnt the golden snitch  taliesin no i put the golden snitch away for the evening  laura i got a natural 20 when i dropped it giving up on it  matt as you guys begin to approach you can see now the ice that encases the golden coins begins  to ripple upward and its getting harder and harder to climb you can see now it comes to an  apex in this bowllike 
none	 formation and as you get to a point where its harder to ascend you can  see tooma stops and sees that she cant go much further and she points up and goes that is  where it sleeps that is where we come to give what we find and that is where it should fall  laura what is its nature is it vain does it want you to bow before it  matt it does not ask for kneeling it asks for fear and respect it asks us to bring the most  powerful creatures in the land 
none	 for it to chase  laura can i roll an insight check on her again jesus this is creepy 27  matt 27  liam so the box is full of loot  sam no its a crate liam  liam the crate is full of boxes  sam yes a crate full of boxes box crate our best sponsor inside the boxes are tinier boxes  liam when do you get to the loot though  sam no its a russian nesting doll of boxes and crates  liam boxbox  sam boxbox and then inside is a boxcrate 
none	 and inside that is tinybagcrate  laura what are you guys talking about  sam liam do you want all those boxes  liam i need boxes  sam you get 3 off the first box of boxes cratecrate  matt all right so this is its home this is its shrine  laura check for fucking traps before we go in there  sam is it up is it down is it through  matt the top comes into this giant bowl this platform of ice and its almost like a nest where  it sits  travis a 
none	 big icy dog bed  sam by the way weve been in dragons lairs before and the lairs themselves do things right  liam yes with the dragon in them  sam but when the dragons not in them they dont do anything  liam my sister and i are going to have a look around i have a question for you though if we  make a stand here today in theory is it worth it to you to stand with us  matt if you feel confident otherwise we walk to our death prematurely  laura yeah lets 
none	 not do that today this is reconnaissance  taliesin if all goes well we will have one more conversation  liam all right im going to start searching the ground for traps  taliesin i do have one other question the bodies on the spikes how did that happen what was that  matt when the islands fell there was a great fight of those that survived against the dragon  we did not join in out of fear and out of not knowing which side would come out vorugal stayed  behind as the other two flew the dragon 
none	 asked us why we do not fight we said because it is not  our place the dragon said well your place is now that of free kin the dragon summoned forth  these spikes and drove it through the hearts of many of the skywalkers many of us cheered for  it was a symbol that many had wished to see for a long time but at the same time the older ones of  us it was not what we wanted it was not how we wished to be freed but we had no way of stopping  
none	 him as time went on and with each surviving skywalker that was found there were no more  cheers just the dread of knowing that maybe in time when all the spikes are filled it may be us  on them next  taliesin thank you  liam 29 looking for any traps  matt okay you spend the next 15 minutes or so 20 minutes skirting around the outside of this  large frozen bowl looking for some semblance of a set trap you dont recognize anything as any sort  of mechanism placed that would set off your 
none	 warning defense systems as a rogue  laura can i stand on the top and look out from the platform and see what is visible from the  platform and what areas seem hidden in the landscape  taliesin im going to join you on that  matt both of you guys roll perception checks  sam i have an idea  taliesin natural 20  marisha natural fucking 20  laura i dont even need to look good  taliesin you both saw that right that just fucking happened this is not my normal die this  is something 
none	 i bought at comic con  matt oh its not the dice anymore we know that youve somehow gained the favor of some aztec  deity thats trying to reclaim its foothold in the currentday pantheon through you  taliesin sumerian you asshole  matt it would be sumerian  taliesin im bringing a shrine to burning man by the way  laura oh this is pertaining to dragons  matt no this is more of an icy terrain nevertheless between the two of you keeping an  eye out through this marduk enkiloving fool over here  taliesin bless 
none	 you for knowing a sumerian deity  matt you look off and see that most of it and its design here is to be a sentry point the  reason its built over the structure is it has a view of the entirety of this central open valley  in the ravine there are nooks and crannies there are elements of ice that can be carved away there  are small alcoves that could be out of sight lower beyond the ice steps and such but there is  no extremely visible pockets or things that are completely out of 
none	 the visual sight from that  perch it was designed specifically to be a place to survey everything  taliesin are there other perches  matt from what you can see here there are outcroppings of stone and elements that jut out  naturally from the valley wall but its a wide berth from each side  taliesin does this seem like the only thing or would there be other sentry points as well  matt if flown to and held in yeah there are a couple of other rock areas where the dragon would  be able to hold 
none	 himself but this is definitively  liam is this the highest  matt which one  liam the highest  travis the highest point  taliesin so we have a really good vantage right now  matt from here yeah this is the highest point in the ravine  taliesin do we see the orb do we see an orb  matt make an investigation check  sam can i help  laura were all looking  taliesin there we go see that wasnt great  sam 28  taliesin 11  liam 17  laura 16  travis nine 
none	  matt you guys take a while glancing about nothing scanlan you dart down and begin peering  up against the ice walls that surround it going down into the actual scooping bowl of this dragon  nest and looking down you can see a little glimmer of light that refracts at a different  angle than the rest of the ice a spherical surface is visible about two and a half feet  below  sam okay do we smash it do we use it to make a crank call what do we do with it steal it  
none	 laura theyll be able to scry on us for sure if we steal it they see us the minute we looked  into brimscythes  sam i could do a vorugal voice and say thordak youre a cock  taliesin we dont actually know his voice  sam i could say thordak im in desperate need of pay  laura do you speak dragon  sam i guess youll have to do that what do we do do we break it so he cant communicate with  the outside that way when we kill him he cant call for help 
none	  travis if we do then we violate what we said we were going to do  sam what did we say we would to do i have a great idea for how to kill this fucker  laura you have a great idea of how to kill it  sam well i have an idea tooma told us that they bring animals to hunt we could be one of those  animals and draw it to a certain spot  taliesin and draw it to a certain spot  sam where we kill it  taliesin with our  
none	 sam with our army of fucking draconians and our ice thing that weve shaped into some sort of a trap  taliesin i get a distinct impression that it is not impressed by ice  sam fire trap rock trap  matt and youre saying this out loud amongst the crew right  sam just us  matt okay  sam oh shit  marisha the ears have walls  laura and also youre right in front of the scrying circle  liam its buried by ice  marisha its buried by ice but that doesnt mean it doesnt work 
none	  matt as soon as you called them draconians there were a few hisses from the nearby crew  marisha the ravenites  taliesin do they speak common  liam some of them do we spoke to them in common  laura we spoke to tooma in common  taliesin lets make a plan  sam i just did i made a plan its an ambush plan  taliesin okay and then we go home and the dragons are at war then what  sam what do you mean the dragons are at war theres only two more dragons at 
none	 that point we  killed threefifths of them  laura if we attack one dragon we start the war that is something weve been told over and over  sam what does that even mean weve already attacked two dragons theres been no war  laura once one more is dead theyll probably all attack  sam attack what  liam theyll stop playing nice theyll start destroying  sam we have to kill them at some point  taliesin yes and now is not that point  laura the greatest plan we have is what grog came up with 
none	 which is pitting them against each  other  sam all right so how do we use this orb to do that right now  marisha do we have to use the orb  sam thats why we came here  laura we came here to find out what its lair looked like  taliesin what we are going to need is we need to sneak you in there and we need you to take a  movement  sam what does that mean  liam a poo scanlan  sam i cant do it anymore  laura and liam 
none	 what  sam i used my last magic poo to look at my daughter  liam what a sentence what a sentence  laura in every aspect scanlan disgusting  matt thats the next tshirt  travis thats amazing i used my last magic poo to look at my daughter  sam i need to know where she is i need to know shes okay gilmore can maybe make me some more  potion but i havent wanted to bother him about it because hes busy keeping a shield around  whitestone  laura dont  sam shit  laura 
none	 you didnt say that out loud you did not just say that out loud  sam i said it in an accent  matt that was out loud  marisha all right hang on lets think about this for a minute  laura can we just step away from the orb while we talk  marisha yeah lets do that  taliesin were not near the orb were near the draconians arent we  travis and marisha ravenites  matt theyre still all gathered around the base they walked you here and theyre basically  watching you set up for 
none	 this ambush preparation or gathering theyre not going to leave you to your  own devices theyre still not quite sure of everything  laura can we sketch what it looks like i think you should sketch percy  sam we need to use this opportunity were never going to be in this dragons lair again this is  it crack the thing set a trap burn it down  travis i have a suggestion  sam yes grog youre the best  travis the white dragon is primal right he likes to hunt creatures weve got to go now 
none	 we  leave we leave them alone that way were not in danger theyre not in danger we promise to come  back not only with forces to help remove the white dragon but also with something for it to  hunt that way were not fighting it in its fucking lair  taliesin we know a lot already  sam i can pretend to be a beast  taliesin scanlan why would you bother to pretend to be a beast if he just finds you hell hunt  you and kill you  travis we know that there are 
none	 people that will work with us we know what the terrain looks like  we know what his lair looks like which we dont want to be in when we fight him and we know how  to get him out of it possibly its a pretty successful trip  liam one possibility is we could come back with galdric and he and i could play bait  sam galdric is the wolf right  liam hes a big fucking wolf  taliesin weve made allies weve got a look at everything we know the terrain and we know the 
none	  political terrain  laura maybe urukat would want to come and fight a dragon  marisha he might  taliesin i will also add that we can leave them with something  marisha thats what i was thinking maybe this isnt about destroying something maybe its about  planting something if we destroy anything the dragons going to immediately blame the locals  laura what would we leave i dont want them able to scry on us  travis how about a little wine  taliesin how about a small grove of trees  marisha i could leave trees 
none	  travis they did want trees  laura i could leave trees too  marisha we also have this scrying eye can i use this remotely  matt no you have to have it in your hands to utilize it  taliesin its all right  travis i like the tree idea  laura tooma just in case something happens and a big red dragon comes to pick a fight everyone  hide get out of the way  matt i appreciate the advice i can guarantee you there would be no other course of action  sam can we 
none	 carve in the lair thordak was here or something  liam theyll know it was you  laura i think we got the information  travis tooma forgive me im not the best speaker but we have learned from fighting these  dragons that if we fight them in their lair we are at a severe disadvantage  matt then get it from its lair  travis we are of a mind on that  laura what kind of creatures do you offer to it for hunt  matt it is growing bored with dire beasts weve even brought it 
none	 to the ocean where there were  some great terrors beneath the sea but it tore them asunder there are northward large  segmented insectlike creatures they call the remorhaz that was a scuffle but i fear the  dragon grows bored  sam got to go find us a beast and bring it here  taliesin no ive got a better idea  liam spit it out  taliesin once weve gathered some resources when we return we prepare to attack posthunt once it  has exhausted itself on something large and angry that is when we strike the 
none	 dragon  laura how will we be able to communicate with them for them to let us know  sam well be here the whole time  taliesin when we come back we stay until its time when we come back it is to end this  liam for now we leave a backdoor entrance  taliesin with the trees we will know how to return quickly with a force  marisha this might be something we go to the slayers take for they always have a roster of  big beasts  taliesin with a little bit of information 
none	 we could even keep them informed of things for it to  kill that they may find around here with the slayers takes help we can keep you in supply of  things to amuse it  matt i trust you know what you say these words mean nothing to me  taliesin we are sorry that this cannot end as quickly as would be agreeable we can do our best  to help make you comfortable and if you need some proof of the power that we wield we can offer a  token i have a thought but 
none	 if you wish a token of our power  matt how about this i trust you to return lets set a time so we know where the limits are  eight days  marisha wow thats soon  taliesin we can send a beast before perhaps but our travel is long we may need more time we have  two more continents  matt how much time do you need  laura and taliesin two weeks  matt two weeks  taliesin continents further than you have walked in your life we move quickly but there is only  so 
none	 much that can be done  matt two weeks 14 sun cycles past if we do not hear from you the frigid doom is known to this  whitestone you speak  laura fucking shit balls scanlan  liam theyre extorting us  matt not extorting making sure you are of your word because otherwise you leave us here to die  on promises that are fake and false  liam tomayto tomahto  laura we dont do that  matt good then well see you before two weeks is out  laura yep  marisha i will leave you 
none	 with a parting gift i will leave you with a grove of trees that should  be evergrowing and present  laura if you do that hell know something is different  marisha he will  taliesin no we plant one tree  marisha one  taliesin no we have to plant some trees find a place that is secret  marisha i can plant these trees anywhere just need solid ground  travis if you can get away from the city  marisha i can possibly do it subterranean  matt there is solid ground here up there above 
none	 the ravine wherever else you need it to be  marisha where does the dragon not tread where do you know he will not see the trees  matt probably out of the ravine he stalks inside quite extensively  taliesin lets find a place this will be where we leave anyway  sam tooma i have one more question about gern blanston i raise the hand cone and i cast  modify memory on her  travis oh no oh jeez oh man i love it  liam look at matts face  matt okay  laura were about 
none	 to get attacked  taliesin no were about to run  liam can i roll my initiative in advance  matt there we go all right whats the dc  sam 21  matt what are you trying to do  sam im trying to change the moment that i said whitestone into emon  matt you watch as she leans in and she shakes her head for a minute and goes what was your  question i do not know these words you speak  sam candles have you ever met a candlemaker  matt i know not of 
none	 a candlemaker  taliesin i do have a request on our way out  matt what is your request  taliesin would the dragon notice if any of these bodies were disturbed  matt many yes but small amounts why if you wish to take what they have they mean nothing to  us one or two turned over will make no difference to the dragon  taliesin pull that one down then  matt right she points to it some of the ravenites come over and haul one of the corpses  off of the spike it breaks off 
none	 and snaps and they bring it and throw it to the ground and step back  taliesin thank you sighs it is exactly what i expect i would assume  matt the robes are familiar the scale color is familiar  taliesin i look it over i check  matt there locked in the moments of valiant defense of his city frozen and lost the remains  of tiberius stormwind left a hero defending his people defaced by vorugal the frigid doom  taliesin lets bring him inside at least  travis yeah i go and i gather the remains 
none	  matt they are stiff and frozen but light enough for you to carry  liam where are we taking him  taliesin i dont know the remnants of the library perhaps the grounds too hard to bury  marisha we cant even pretend like he was our friend  taliesin no we absolutely cannot  travis i have a horrible thought if we move him will the dragon know we were here  sam was he on one of those stakes  taliesin he was no i checked unless hes very clever and very keen and i dont think 
none	 they are  i think that if they knew he would be in a more exalted position of defacement i think this is  just slaughter things vanish im all right with making this vanish thats as much of a calling  card as i feel we need to leave  travis where should we bring him  sam his home doesnt really exist anymore  marisha his home was with us  laura back to emon  taliesin i have a thought  liam to our keep it was very important to him  sam this is his place 
none	  taliesin were not bringing him to us were leaving him here but were putting him somewhere  appropriate  liam wed take him away can you melt ice and snow and well lay him here  taliesin put him with the books  laura he always loved them  sam for now anyway and then when we free this place we can find a proper tomb for him  travis we take him back to where the frozen books lay  matt you find the remnants of the library as you find a section of the stone rubble thats 
none	 loose  enough you pull it open and there beneath you can see there are hundreds and hundreds of books  many still pristine if a little soggy from the melted snow you gather a lot of time was spent in  this library in his youth and its probably as good a place as any to leave his memory for the time  laura are any of the ravenites around us or are we alone  matt theyre keeping their distance but theyre watching you get the sense that they understand  whats going on but theyre not taking 
none	 any offense to it  taliesin this will do  liam i start pulling books out  marisha i start melting ice  laura is lockheed still on my shoulder  matt lockheed is still on your shoulder  laura i bring him down so he can say goodbye  matt as the ice melts color comes to the body you can see the tattered robes that show a fierce  battle was fought regardless of this condition of finding him knowing him as well as you did he  still probably left a hero as you lay him down 
none	 on the books mostly thawed now lockheed finds a  moment of recognition and immediately flutters onto his chest and curls up mews a bit nibbles  at the chin  liam im going to sit three or four feet away from him facing him and start privately thanking  the raven queen for ushering him on  travis im going to take a chalice out of the bag of holding and i begin to fill it with ale and  then remember he preferred water and i take the alchemy jug and i pour fresh water into the  
none	 chalice and lay it with him  marisha i take and i rip off a piece of his robes tuck it away  taliesin can you seal it  matt as you guys step back the nearby stone clatters to life  laura i get lockheed out of there i dont want him to stay in do you want to come  matt lockheed resists and resists and doesnt want to leave  laura in draconic i say its all right  matt lockheed curls up onto his face and nibbles a bit on the forehead then turns back and 
none	  flutters up onto your shoulder the stonework clatters closed over the top of the rubble of the  library  marisha keyleth drops to her knees and starts crying  matt vax in this moment of sadness there is a bit of warmth as you sense though remote as it  is through the divine gate the raven queens assurance that his spirit has made it to the other side  laura i put my hand on keyleths shoulder he loved you well princess  marisha he was so stupid  liam he meant well  taliesin im going 
none	 to find tooma is she behind us  marisha he should have never left our side  taliesin hopefully this war will go on schedule but theres our promise thats the best youre  going to get i head out  marisha i follow percy  sam i turn around and say goodbye old friend well come back and well fix this because this  is poppycock  matt as you gather yourselves up here amongst the ruins of draconia the last of the skys  light the sun has faded and the night has taken its form you hear 
none	 the distant caws of the evening  birds as they begin to take to the skies above the ravine tooma and the rest of the ravenites give a  nod as you join hands keyleth  marisha lets go home  taliesin yes lets theres much to do  marisha back to whitestone  laura were you going to leave a tree  marisha yeah  taliesin we let them know where the grove would be found before we left them  marisha i do plant growth make a big old tree  matt all righty where do you create 
none	 the tree  marisha wherever we decided it was best to create the tree  laura outside of the ravine  taliesin at the top a little grove of trees  matt which with a simple use of the broom or wild shape you can make your way up there find a  small patch of bushes create a single tree that didnt exist there previously a small sapling now  grown to full height the bastion of a promise to be kept keyleth returns you take hands you step  through the nearest tree as the portal opens and 
none	 find yourself emerging from the other side of the  sun tree back in whitestone  marisha i give the sun tree a little pat  matt the morning sun begins to rise  taliesin well report what weve seen well try to gain our bearings again get sleep tonight  well report what weve seen in the new room no one else and we will never utter this citys name  outside these walls again  sam totally dick move  matt you find yourselves to rest keeping memories fresh untill sleep takes you  marisha knock on vaxs 
none	 door  sam oh god  matt all right as everyone else is going to rest keyleth you find your way to vaxs door  marisha can i stay with you tonight  liam i dont fuck anything up with words and i open the door  sam what  liam im not going to fuck it up by saying anything i open the door  marisha i just go in  matt whether or not you are taking the time to sleep or ruminate on the events as its only been  half a day since last you woke 
none	 up you take some time with lockheed he eats a little more food and  leaps to the window of your room and then takes off over the rest of whitestone  you process this time this moment this memory and realize how much has been lost through this  journey but yet how much is worth saving how much is worth fighting for and then as much as  you bunch of fuckup misfits that came together as friends years ago have come to a point of  understanding your true worth and what the importance is of really 
none	 standing up for the things  that you believe in in this world and the people that need protecting and know that the next step  of your journey should come soon whether you stand or fall this is the fight that needs to be  fought and with luck be at your side that terrible fucking dragon will meet its end soon  enough  and with that well pick up next week on thursday  taliesin glad we decided to take a lighthearted game  sam its a fun romp after the feywild a fun romp  liam 
tavern	 bar hop bar crawl  marisha i need a stiff drink  matt i was simultaneously looking forward to and not looking forward to the return to draconia for  that reason  laura man  matt well pick it up next week guys  marisha yay  matt im sorry sorry guys sorry to you  laura thanks loot crate  sam 3 discount  travis pour one out for tibs we will be  matt not all narrative is bright but it has its purpose  sam were next  laughter  matt we love you guys thank
