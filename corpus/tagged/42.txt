none	 you very much for  coming i guess ill go ahead and ill take a seat over here well share mics weve got a mic here  weve got a mic there and orions rocking the front stage there you go its nap time for  orion all right so i guess well begin with a  what the heck  screaming and cheering  matt you guys did this no i had no idea all right so we didnt know she was here we thought  she was in new york away forever these are real tears ladies and 
none	 gentlemen oh my god thats  amazing weve got more mics perfect  marisha ashley what are you doing here  ashley oh hey grog hi its a long story ill tell you guys after  matt well im glad you could make it  ashley hey im glad to be here  matt everybody this is ashley johnson our wonderful cleric pike  cheering  matt all right wow so after that emotional moment so for those of you who dont know we  are critical role were a bunch of voice actors actors that have been playing dungeons 
none	 and dragons  together for going on almost three years now and we recently had the pleasure to be approached by  geek and sundry to have us begin bringing our wondrous little personal adventure out to you guys  via their twitch channel and weve done 16 episodes so far and the outpouring of appreciation for it  and the connection weve made with you guys in the community has been absolutely electric and  amazing i think all of us agree with that definitely but yeah its been a really  interesting journey lets go down on the 
none	 end here and talk a little bit about ourselves and what we  do and how we got pulled into this craziness  taliesin oh god ive got to start really  marisha i mean everyones voice actors so we can get that out of the way right  liam probably also talk about how you got into dd at what point in your life add that in  taliesin okay i can do that thats much more interesting than voice acting my name is taliesin  jaffe i got into roleplaying in high school with well i had funny 
none	 hair and wore a lot of  black so i played vampire the masquerade and i larped i was a big larper for those i dont  think i have to explain that and had a group of friends in high school and we would do everything  from weird games like we played gurps and rifts and cyberpunk and all those games in the early  90s late 80s and it had a been a while for me and then i got pulled into a completely different  game with matt and a few friends of ours so we 
none	 played for about a year and a half and then well  get to the story of liams game but i got pulled into the game that was the first game and it has  ruined me for every other game i could possibly want to play  marisha yes i guess i first got into tabletop roleplaying in particular with matt matt was  actually my first dm six seven years ago approximately and ive had other games i was a  part of a buffy the vampire slayer tabletop rpg which was super fun yup its a good 
none	 game i was  a pyromancer it was awesome i will say though once you have matt its hard to go back once you  go matt you cant go back it works shut up dont judge me travis  matt thats not becoming a tshirt  offscreen yes it is  marisha chris hi how are you i didnt see you oh and its erika hi you guys  orion okay how about you laura  laura oh hey oh hi guys hi im laura bailey rpgs huh so the first time i ever played pencil  and paper 
none	 rpg was with this group because of that guy i always played rpgs like im a big video  game fan im a geek for that and yeah and so i always chose rpgs as what i wanted to play so  surprisingly it wasnt anything new for me once we started playing i fell into it really really  fast because i was accustomed to all of that  liam some would say instantly  laura insta it was so much fun it was only supposed to be a oneoff game when we started  this and we all 
none	 had so much fun playing together that it was like we cant stop this whens the  next time we can get together and do it again and again and again yeah it was epic  liam the longer version of that story for anybody who doesnt know it is several years  ago  orion thats liam obrien everybody  liam oh hi im liam obrien hi just so happy several years ago i was directing matt for the  first time for a game we knew each other but not as well as we do now and he 
none	 would come in and  every time he came in like a drug pusher be like you should come we could do a oneoff i  could play with you you played when you were younger we should play together  matt hey man roll some dice itll be fun what could possibly happen i wont tell your parents  liam and i refused every time i said oh thatd be great but i got brandnew kids cause  i had brandnew kids and then fastforward to several years later where sam riegel whos not  here and i do 
none	 a dorky podcast and we do something dorky every time and i thought one  time well play a pen and paper roleplaying game and we asked these yahoos and we played the game  and it was a blast and then everyone left and i went home that night and went oh man that was  so good how do i tell them i want to do it again and i sent out an email and nobody  responded for a long time  laura that is true actually yeah  liam couple of days so i felt like 
none	 i had a big red n on my forehead but then the answers  trickled in and we kept playing and now were here and theres a baseball field behind us  cheering  matt take that sports  laura yeah sportsball  ashley i shouldnt do that what they do here is really awesome  matt no this is great  ashley yeah i got involved because of this guy they had already played a game one game and then  i remember we had a party for a friend of ours troy baker it was his birthday and 
none	 you guys were  talking about it and i was like oh dang i want to play and then we started and we were  putting our character sheets together and then i sent you i was like yeah i think my name  should be i dont know pike trickfoot you were so helpful and emailing me back then the first  game because id never really played anything like this before and im sure you guys can tell in the  game im always like wait what is this or what does this mean i was in awe 
none	 of everybody  because they were doing voices and i was trying to keep up but i couldnt really and i was like  i want to do this all the time every night can we and then we started doing it all the time  honestly some of the best nights of my life have been from this game  offscreen love you ashley  ashley love you  matt orion  travis oh you me hi  laura hi  travis im travis i play grog super smart i never played any  laura also ale  travis 
none	 huh also ale i never played any rpgs before this but i had asked around our little  voice actor community for years like yuri lowenthal and liam and matt mercer i think the  first time i asked you about it was on a mocap session i was like i hear you do the master of  dungeonings what does that look like and he started to tell me and i couldnt concentrate on  anything beside the fact that i wanted to do it then liam had that birthday party and i came 20  minutes late i 
none	 walked in to laura being extremely posh and bargaining with somebody for something  liam was going yes of course oh hello sir i was terrified i think matt had said just  prepare your class and your race i said goliath barbarianhe goes okay so whats your  name i was like um grog he was grog what do you do i was like i make fine leather  boots he goes okay bootmaker grog and we were off to the races but that has led us to  this somehow  orion greetings and salutations everyone im orion 
none	 acaba im a voice actor did you guys  okay thats enough keyleth im a big magic the gathering guy also with travis and laura i  hadnt played dd before liams birthday he was like hey were doing this dd thing i was  like dd okay ive known liam the longest maybe you the longest but hes like a brother to  me so ill do whatever i was like yeah i can play and stuff that led to a bond and a  friendship and experience that i cant replicate or pay any money or do anything 
none	 to even compare to  anything else to this game has literally become the most important thing and most fun thing in my  life every week through time and bullshitting around wed find and tweeted stuff and randomly  in our privacy of our own game and fucking now were what the fuck is going on  liam lets play ball  orion scanlan sends his regards as hes too busy fucking whores oh thats right sorry everyone  matthew mercer is great now you talk  cheering  matt you have disadvantage for the remainder of the panel 
none	 yeah thats the story of how it all came  together there are few things i enjoy more than having people converse with me and say like im  interested in roleplaying games but i dont know how they work or what theyre about i hear its a  weird thing and im like well kind of but the best kind of weird knowing that once these  people especially being geared towards performance arts and putting ourselves in a  different place mentally for a lot of our job itll be an easy transition for them to get into 
none	  it watching them all suddenly click that moment of oh i can do anything yes well you can try  anything that doesnt mean youll do it but you can certainly try but yeah its been an absolute  wonderful joy watching this game grow and the community grow since we started the stream and  yeah its probably one of my favorite things period ever in my life so far the fact that we  get to share it with you guys now is even more amazing and you guys have been incredible this  entire journey so 
none	 thank you for that guys sincerely  cheering  laura its amazing the amount of times that weve had conversations because when youre playing a  game we all see it as real weve lived those experiences for so long that that world exists and  our characters exist and those experiences exist but only between us and then as soon as we were  able to bring it to geek and sundry and now you guys are taking part in it too all of a sudden  its a real thing if that makes any sense to know that 
none	 you guys know who percy is  is phenomenal and that anybody loves trinket as much as i do that means so much  liam its like we were all quietly privately going crazy when we were just playing a game but  now you guys are saying the weird whispers that we heard in our head youre parroting them back to  us were like oh percy is real hes real i know hes real  laura were all going to be insane in the next five years i know it  marisha yeah it does feel like being 
none	 the little kid whos like no theres a monster under our  bed and everyone was like oh yeah no youre right there totally is a monster kicking it under  there and youre like what they see it too and i feel like thats true every time we  get a piece of fanart that comes in because i know personally i was afraid i was like i hope  this story translates i hope what we see they can see but every time we see a piece of fanart or  anything like that its like oh yeah 
none	 no thats yep thats gilmore holy shit they see  it too  matt and on that note too the fanart the letters the recently penned critmas that has  happened a few times its a strange experience because for us just a humility standpoint its  like why are they buying us things they dont need to do that but it becomes this wonderful  connection point where we get the opportunity through that to also realize how much it means to  other people through these letters and these people that donate to our charity 826la by the 
none	  way which is an amazing charity  cheering  matt you guys have done an amazing job helping us support that too and its been a really really  incredible experience to know that something that means so much to us also is starting to mean so  much to other people as well and its amazing  liam its nice to have a show about dd huh  cheering  matt were having this strange tabletop renaissance now where you used to keep that stuff  close to your chest youd mention yeah i play dungeons and dragons 
none	 youd be kind of quiet  about it now we can say it a little more proudly and as opposed to people saying yeah dd  thats nerd stuff theyre like cool when do you play  orion yeah i have to say one of my favorite aspects of what this is is we have and i said  this to one of our fans i signed something for her is travis is one of my favorite things about  the show tiberius is my favorite thing about the show but travis as a human being theres a lot  
none	 of it breaks down those stupid walls where its like no its not a bunch of introverts in  somebodys basement we have a big hulking mass of a man you know that can beat all of us up  and hes there being as big of a geek as we are and it breaks down the thing where women cant  play because you have these three gorgeous badass women kicking ass and also playing dungeons  and dragons a lot of great things about this show that i love  ashley i remember i was introducing you to 
dung	 a friend of mine and completely out of context i  was like and this was still when it was kind of new and i was like oh this is matt hes my  dungeon master and then i kept moving on and they looked at me and i was like oh wow that  sounded really weird  matt what you didnt see was me the whole time behind you going like  laughter  ashley i was like what i mean is we play dd that sounded so not what it is  matt i can show you 
none	 the velvet room if you like  travis matt pulls out a d20 hes like roll it  laughter  laura mr mercers been waiting for you  matt id forgotten about that well before we get to the qa session is there anything else you guys  wanted to talk about here particularly while were on a baseball field talking about dungeons  and dragons  travis were on a baseball field  cheering  travis stand up if youre wearing one of our amazing critical role shirts because theyre all  over the place counting thats amazing we 
none	 love you we love you for buying those its insane  that you have them and we love you  matt we have original generation we have the second generation release too we have the new  generation which by the way the new red shirts you see with the critical role logo designed by  taliesin jaffe over here percy designed those himself  ashley i was wearing my shirt on the plane but then i dropped my cinnamon roll with you guys  can probably tell on the show im constantly eating because im always hungry  orion 
none	 so that was a cinnamon roll fail  ashley yeah but it was a cinnamon roll and it was a cinnabon with the fresh sauce all right i  cant wear this to the panel  matt we wouldnt have judged  taliesin i love that today seven people have come up to me with this intense look in their eyes and  theyve come up to me very quietly and been like hey briarwoods man wow wow  laughter  taliesin this is weird private issues in my life that im like yeah i know wow it is fabulous 
none	  to finally have an audience weve been playing in this little room knowing that there are people  there in theory but to actually  marisha its kind of like a reality show but were not putting ourselves through the wringer  were putting our characters through it so its great  taliesin better them than us  travis people going oh keyleths mom man youre like yeah wait what right thats a  real thing thats a real thing  marisha i will say no you  laura wait  orion for the record im really shitty at 
none	 math so  marisha what i was actually going to say was i am actually really impressed at the critters as a  whole and the critter nation we had an awesome story that we heard from our friend dani whos a  critter  ashley oh man hi  marisha i know right hi yeah she came out here and then was talking to another critter and  he was like youre in southern california well i know people at disneyland so i can get you  passes to disneyland and it was just because they like critical role 
none	  laura be a critter go to disneyland thats the moral of the story  marisha so you guys are awesome because you guys are taking care of each other and im really  loving the communities that im seeing are being built and the friendships that are being built  around this  matt and the other campaigns that are coming out of this all you guys who have already been  playing or starting your own games and tweeting at us your adventures and your stories and your  characters its so awesome to see that continue to 
none	 grow  taliesin its like the internet but nice its so crazy  orion yeah its super weird ive been youtubing comedy stuff for a bit theyre mean and our  people are not mean and theyre really intelligent and compassionate its fucki really great  laura what is happening  matt i dont know  liam were all kind of playing ourselves people lets be real  matt yeah tiberiuss wisdom maybe not that far off  laughter  travis my intelligence is still six  laura well yeah  marisha questions qa  matt lets go ahead and 
town	 move on to the qa section of this we have a mic available i  believe its somewhere  marisha yeah is there a mic floating around  ashley singing i believe theres a mic  liam i got it i got it  marisha liams got it  liam put your hands up if youve got questions  orion vax is stealthing into the crowd  laura you have to sneak through though they wont be able to  matt microphonemicrophonemicrophone  audience member i have a question for orion when you wanted that thing from scanlan how long 
none	 did  it take you to think that up to do that on that board  orion i wanted that thing since he got it and really  laura and he wouldnt give it to you  orion no and i was going to approach it several ways and i talked to matthew a lot outside the  game i never metagame but i get really excited ive been playing rpgs since i was ten and so  half the time i think of strategy as opposed to the player i get really into that matthews  really good at 
none	 think of who youre dealing with and then act accordingly with sam hes an  interesting fellow to begin with i was going to pummel him to death really to get it back at first  marisha to which i was like remember your party would not take kindly to that i dont think  keyleth would be able to take your back on that one  orion no she wouldnt like that so i didnt thats the simple silence telekinesis and then  fireball him to death the thing is im a ucb guy upright citizens brigade hes also 
none	 a funny guy  there you go ucb hes funny im funny ill use funny then it was empty chalkboard i was like  math thatll be funny ill fucking come up with something i figured more bees with honey or  flies i have no idea how that saying goes you know what i was trying to say right  liam its the honey  orion use the honey instead i thought of that for a month of how to get that back  laura it was worth it  liam you mean you thought of that right there 
none	 in the moment it suddenly burst into your mind and  you did it right there  orion for the math thing yes  ashley that math moment it was one of my favorites  travis we love scanlan by the way every time he comes up with a song i ask him afterwards im  like did you have two songs on retainer that you were going to sing during the show  liam you guys have a baseball field behind you you look amazing  marisha shut up oh my god  audience member everyone looks very pretty 
none	 you touched on this a bit whenever you were talking  about how you started playing how did you all come up with your names individually  liam thats a good question  matt mines my professional name i use it for most things its easy for me to hear when people  say it because its my name  ashley oh man i had been trying to put together this webseries ages ago that was basically a  postzombie apocalypse type of thing then cut to a little while later i work on a game called last  of 
none	 us which was basically the same thing but my characters name in the webseries  matt by the way how amazing was she in that  ashley thank you so the webseries that my characters name was pike in it i just like that  name and i honestly dont know where trickfoot came from i cant remember it  matt your imagination  ashley i was like true tritch trutch pike tr oh trickfoot i dont know there was  nothing interesting about it  laura i like i said like to play rpgs a lot and vex was 
none	 always a name that i would go to for  my characters i would create in those games then i always think that elves need to have apostrophes  in their names because in every rpg like dragon age every game that i play i recreate characters  like ten times before i stick with one so theres a list to level four of characters  travis true story  laura yeah vex is always in that list theres other names as well that i might get to someday  in this game hopefully not  orion wait you did 
none	 that for skyrim too didnt you  laura yes of course im not vex in skyrim because i feel like vex is sacred now i dont  want to use vex on is that weird then when me and liam okay so heres the thing im getting  offsubject when i got invited to the game liam had already taken rogue and i wanted to be a  rogue he had already taken halfelf and i wanted to be a halfelf and i was like what the heck  man youre so stealthy then i remembered that we actually are 
none	 twins and i was like maybe we  should be twins in the game as well  liam you said your name was vex so i said oh ill be vax then  laura perfect  liam thats not what you said you said but my names short for vexhalia so you got to come  up and i went ill be vaxildan without a beat you went oh thats pretty good  laura thats really good whats funny is for the first year you kept looking at me like  whats my name how do i spell my name 
none	  travis we still dont get it right  laura is there an h in it i dont know  marisha i actually still use vaxystabby to remember that cause we said vaxstab like  backstab so he does vaxstab as rogue  liam there you go now you all have that  marisha vaxstab  laura thats an easy way to remember  marisha vexdex yeah that works ill buy that for a dollar workshop it i also really like  elven names but im like i feel that my name should have meaning i dont know why ill 
none	 tend  to pick a character  for keyleth i was like shes an air druid so ill name her something airy so ill type in  air ill go to an elven dictionary and ill type in air itll pop out all these elven  words for air or if my character was angsty ill put in angsty and itll pull out all these  elven words for angsty and i picked something based on that so i think keyleth was actually  originally spelled with a q it was a que it meant like a zephyr it meant 
none	 like a wind so i  switched it and renamed it and got keyleth  laura so your name actually means fart and you just dont know it  matt exactly yeah in sylvan  marisha no it means silent but deadly  travis whats the explanation behind yours  taliesin oh boy  orion yeah whats your name again  taliesin percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  orion they call him percy though  taliesin they call me percy i decided after i had an image of the character i wanted to play i  wanted 
dung	 him to have a ridiculous name because i love ridiculous names its actually a mixture of  three things one of which is a character i was a child actor also one of them is the name of a  character i played as a child actor the other section of it is the name of an anime character  from legend of the galactic heroes and the third chunk of it is actually a friend of mine who i  will not name but who has the greatest name on earth yes ill leave it a mystery because he 
none	  doesnt know that i stole his name for my little dd game  marisha and now were trademarking it  taliesin and thankfully hes 80 years old and lives in italy so he doesnt have to know about  this and i want to keep it that way thats basically where my characters name came from  this is a mix of all three of those things  liam somewhere in tuscany a little old italian man is standing up in front of his computer and  swearing in italian  taliesin he types all in caps too so 
none	 ill never know how angry he is  travis other than just coming up with it because i hadnt made a name yet because im an idiot i  loved monkey island the game and i remember that was my introduction to grog i always figured that  a barbarian needs a really simple name so grog was the first stupid light that turned on in my  brain and thats what i am and you came up with my last name  matt strongjaw yeah  travis thats right because i got possessed or something at one point it 
none	 was bad you  liam im done tiberius  taliesin bring us home  orion tiberius i named for two reasons the first is tiberius caesar is caesars father i  wanted the character because it comes from a political height to your family to have that  weight behind it and stormwind  travis its about farting  liam thats another fart reference  orion this is yes i fart a lot no i was actually  ashley who doesnt  orion at the time i was cracking the hell out of skyrim again it came out and you 
none	 were passing  and playing it again when we started the campaign and i think its a place in skyrim or its like  the stormwind or something like that i was like yeah stormwind awesome  marisha but i would like to point out we didnt even realize that you had done that until a few  weeks ago  orion yeah  marisha and we were like ah because you were playing elder scrolls online thats what it was  orion thank you two and a half years and some change years pass yeah im really creative ive 
none	  totally its really hard not to curse so im trying not to i was like wow yeah i came up  with all that myself and then i started playing elder scrolls online again bad love that game i  was dragonknight cool fans were hey just try dragonknight and then i started playing and im  like draconic power draconia oh shit i ripped off skyrim the whole time im not creative at  all thanks for pointing that out marisha  liam any more questions  matt real fast i did want to give a shoutout to 
none	 our wonderful gnome scanlan who is apparently  watching from home and wants an ego stroke  all hi scanlan  ashley we miss you  liam all right what  matt we have about 15 minutes left of the panel so we want to make this questions we have pretty  quick answers to  liam but were periscoping  inaudible audience member  liam what each characters most heroic moment was on the show any time including the whole game  matt lets do whole game i know tiberius want me to tell the story  laura i 
dung	 feel like matt would know our most  matt i know a lot of them yeah there was one sequence ill make it quick they were fighting  their first umber hulk they ever encountered in this nest that was in this cavern up at the top of  a giant underground cave and there was an about 170foot drop into a lake that had an island in  the center and they were fighting it grog was trying to grab it and throw it through the hole  that dropped into this giant cavern however it bull rushed him 
none	 and knocked him off instead grog  fell took enough damage to put him unconscious from full life and the umber hulk then was pushed  out after him via tiberius and they all realized oh were all up here with a hole with no  creature grogs unconscious down there with an umber hulk he is going to die and so tiberius  decides hes going to jump out after him and he leaps through the hole swan dive im talking  gandalf versus the balrog style you know slow plummet in darkness im telling him you  realize 
none	 casting feather fall is going to take a really hard concentration check and if you fail  youre probably going to die and he said yes do it he needed a 14 on a d20 and he rolled  exactly a 14 cast feather fall landed and managed to stop the umber hulk in time to let the  rest of the party come down via rope it was one of my favorite moments for his character  cheering  laura it was pretty epic  orion i got your back  matt anyone else  laura we thought we 
none	 were going to lose two party members at the same time we were like no ugh  matt anyone else  laura well i got the kill on the creature that killed pike  ashley you did  laura i dont get a final kill on a lot of things and it was like ugh and so pike is dead  on the ground and i got the last shot so im moving forward shooting arrows it was sad tears  falling down screaming pike  marisha i was actually going to say i think one of my most heroic 
none	 moments was in the same game  when pike died and keyleth turned into an eagle and i scooped you up and got you to the temple  first was it at the same time that the tower was collapsing  matt no that was beforehand  marisha oh that was beforehand okay  matt a battle with a treachery demon by the way a glabrezu for those who are in the know i get  to say that in a panel  orion translation hes a giant butthole  taliesin i was quite proud of the magic carpet save 
none	 our very first runin with the magic carpet  its a very complicated story but we found the magic carpet out of luck while falling out of a  building and everything kind of worked out okay no one died  marisha the magic carpet was awesome because we were trying to use it as a parachute  laura thats right because we were falling  marisha and it was essentially a gamble move anyway we were going to be like oh lets be  laura this carpets never going to work its too heavy  marisha exactly we are 
none	 going to be like those toy gi joes that you throw over your balcony and  it doesnt work thats what we thought then were trying to parachute with a rug and thats  when matts like and you float down slowly because you learn the carpet is magic  ashley right before that he goes make a use magic device roll and we were all what and  you screamed its a flying carpet  liam many of you have seen this moment because ashley made a video its online you get a lot of  our reactions to 
none	 that real time  orion that whole thing was another one of my favorite tiberius moments because he didnt deal  with any of it tiberius jumped out the window while that shit was going down and feather fall to  safety while these guys had to deal with that whole fucking thing  travis i did that too i jumped out of the window with no feather fall  orion they go through this whole ordeal and they come out of this tower thats crumbling barely  with their lives and im like oh hello everyone  travis you 
none	 go jump out of the window and im like great idea jump out of the window you  cast feather fall and im like shit live and learn  marisha singing i wish you would step back from that ledge my friend  travis my most heroic thing was when you crushed my cask of ale and i avenged it by headbutting the  giant in the face true love people true love  liam i dont know about heroic but i think the most intense moment ive had in our entire game  was sneaking in with scanlan into 
none	 the mind flayers little camp you were just describing all  the things that were in the room and we were walking quietly through the room looking at it my  heart was going like a hamster it was intense  orion and then sam throws shit on the dudes face  marisha at any moment you hear us on the screen being like oh god im hyperventilating the  adrenaline my hearts racing im shaking thats all 100 real well actually be like oh  weve got to roll oh i dropped it its awful its all real its 
none	 good  liam any other questions  marisha ten minutes  matt you have time for a few more so start getting these pretty rapid  liam sword maybe take your filter out of the way  audience member thanks man hey guys hows it going  matt good good question next no go ahead  audience member my question isnt about dd its actually how are you guys enjoying your time here  in san diego or more specifically at comiccon whats the best or most shocking cosplay youve  seen or a cosplay where you guys were like 
none	 oh thats awesome have you guys even seen any  cosplay or have you been too busy  travis weve seen no cosplay  marisha weve been here the whole time  matt im having a good time  marisha yeah were having a great time  travis this sucks  marisha we have a baseball field behind us so thats cool  matt best cosplay ive seen here it was a couple years ago i saw a really amazing mass effect  group that had an urdnot wrex that had a functional animatronic face it was incredible  taliesin 
none	 i saw a guy dressed as hodor with a box of raisin bran on his back it was awesome  orion weve got another question  audience member sorry orion hi this is a dm question for matt because  matt oh hi  audience member hi i had problems with this in previous campaigns as a player and now as a dm  with six new players how do you keep battle going when players take time to roll how can you  encourage people to keep a flow going so at the end of the game youre like 
none	 that was epic  instead of that was math  matt right the system helps our transition from pathfinder to fifth edition i did partially  because of that pathfinders a great system and i love it but the more players you have the more  you can get bogged down with floating modifiers wait your bless spells gives me plus one to  hit and damage and that gives me plus two to damage but i have a racial bonus against the  kobolds plus six to hit four to damage three to damage it gets to that point 
none	 being able to  simplify the modifiers you can homerule certain things where you have a simple way of keeping  track of those as a dm keeping combat going is just keeping your energy up youre the guide for  everyone else and if you start getting slow or laggy everyone else will follow suit music also helps  i find battle music really good sets we cant use any licensed stuff on the stream any more i  had to gut my previous music selections good classic conan music works well lot of great  fantasy films and 
none	 good soundtracks work  marisha and laura horn sounds  matt they know them all too well good music keeping your energy up and making sure that when  it comes to players turns they know what theyre going to do if theyre not ready you skip their  turn youre hesitating  laura thats happened to us a few times before we started streaming he would skip our turns  marisha you would be like what are you going to do and if we say uh more than three times  then hes like nah wed go uh uh 
none	 uh moving on  matt skip it or put them at the bottom of the initiative order give them an incentive to be  present in the moment and already to have their ideas ready to go things change in battle  sometimes youll get to your turn and everythings changed in the battle dynamic thats  also how battle works you have to be like uh im going to do this and youre like  all right keeping that energy up as the dm youre the holder of the flow of the story its a  lot of pressure 
none	 on you but keep up that energy some good music make sure people are also putting  energy into it because you put countless hours into that stuff the least they can do is respect  that by being present and trying to keep up with you  taliesin really quick tell them about the hourglass  matt also hourglass helps i got a nice five minute and ten minute hourglass especially if  youre in a skill challenge or an event that has more tension behind it just putting an hourglass  on the table turning it over and 
none	 being like you have this much time until what you dont  know but what are you going to do youll be surprised how quickly in the moment every player is  laura its terrifying that hourglass you put down when the lava was coming down and we had to  get out of the cavern it was horrifying  orion it adds a whole other layer of another question  audience member hi guys what i wanted to ask  liam get it right up there  audience member what i wanted to ask is especially for grog and 
none	 pike since they personally  experienced this lovely thing was there ever a time when you die in matts game where youre  afraid that this is going to be the death of the character and theyre not going to get revived  this time  orion yes  liam thats every game  travis when pike died she was crying she was crying she was crying you were crying i was  asleep no matt you could tell he did not want to say the things he was saying and it was only  because we rolled extremely well 
none	 when it counted that we got that thing that brought you back to  life every time we go unconscious and then the death sets in against the beholder thing i was  just hoping we got around to pike or keyleth so that greater restoration could come around i  wouldnt permanently be dead theres a chance that one of these days  laura when you were unconscious in the lava what i thought he was done if trinket dies i yes  orion in all seriousness the kvarn fight is a really good example myself tiberius was  
none	 terrified of fighting a beholder because i knew particularly as the only real caster of the group  as soon as i get in the eyesight of that thing im useless the reason that i didnt go in there  at all is because if i did i would be no use to anybody i dont know the range im not going to  cheat you dont come back from disintegration  matt nope  orion you dont come back from death rays theyre called death rays for a reason and then  he throws it at us and im 
none	 scared for a while  ashley that was the most nervous id ever been in any game weve played i think thats why it  was such a silent game i was just like i just never wanted it to be my turn because i was like  uh well  travis we didnt even talk in voices  ashley i know there were no voices  matt youre twice the reason we still have grog he technically would have died twice that battle  over  laura that is true  ashley thats true oh grog  laura i 
none	 went back and watched the stream of that to see if you could see our hands shaking as much  as they were because all of us were terrified during that fight  matt yeah that was a crazy boss battle what were you going to say liam  laura and then the second one was even harder than that what the heck matt  matt that was less of a boss battle and more of a scenariobased challenge you walked into the  center of an illithid colony and freed them of their oppressor  marisha exactly were their 
none	 saviors  taliesin we had a buddy  orion more like a butthole  matt lessons were learned people  marisha by the way this is essentially a glimpse into our time after the show cuts its us yelling  and being like why did you do that you could have died dont you scare me like that again  feel like a protective mom being like slamming on the brakes  orion one more question  matt we have time for one more really fast rapidpaced question well answer and cruise  through it we have a minute left 
none	 and then we have to run  liam as orion is running out please take a moment to appreciate the fact that weve been  talking about dungeons  dragons for an hour in front of a baseball stadium  cheering  liam and marisha our time is now  audience member all right guys real quick same time next year  matt same time next year were down  laura yeah  ashley its a date  marisha we brought sleeping bags  matt wed be happy to  marisha yeah well be here  laura you guys are 
none	 awesome  ashley all hail  marisha oh ify  ify question for the dm i heard rumors that there might be a little space for a sellsword of  some type if you got the gold for it ive got regina and linda waiting by my sacks of gold  matt classic dwarven request  marisha money talks and bullshit walks  matt we shall see if the adventures of vox machina mind their way towards vox moronica guys  that is the end of our panel i want to thank you all so much for coming  cheering
