the areas that were heavily hit by this earthquake having lived through a  number of earthquakes in my youth its a very scary and very dangerous thing and nothing on the  scale of what theyre undergoing there so if you have the opportunity we want to promote unicef  and oxfam m√©xico the links will be in the chat soon but if you can please give it all helps and  people who are in the middle of that scenario will be very thankful thank you very much  all right on that note lets go ahead /none/ and dive in to tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back you guys can discuss this in a minute last we left off vox  machina had been climbing their way through the bowels of an undead risen primordial titan  previously having found information about the history of vecna from the knowing mistress  regarding his ascension the avatar form and the drive he needs to create a miracle before he can  truly embody and begin to grow the power to really exemplify the abilities of the god that he has /none/ now  become you began to make your way through the interior where you battled corrupted earth  elementals that existed in him naturally you began to battle undead skeletons and undead  trolls eventually after making your way towards a series of keytrapped rooms one of which seemed  to be some sort of mirrored incinerator you made your way towards an upward tunnel and encountered  a number of disciples cultists of the undying king vecna  in this confrontation you encountered facetoface a sphere of annihilation and through  some clever uses of shortrange teleportation and losing /none/ ones face you managed to stop them  before one they destroyed your party or managed to escape to alert others of your presence and  last we left off you all were resting within that hallway thinking about what the next course of  action is  so vox machina what would you like to do  travis cry hold each other  marisha so we were going up a tunnel  laura yeah we need to keep going up oh somebody needs to heal scanlan  travis i think it was the other side of your face last /none/ week  laura no it was the same side  liam i palm scanlan by the face and cast lay on hands how bad are you buddy  sam you know medium  liam medium  laura i think its more like when your toe was missing i think its like that  liam im dumping 29 hit points of paladin power into your face  marisha isnt that most of your paladin power  liam yeah its all but one  marisha oh dear god  laura but what if you needed that  marisha weve got other people /none/ who can do healing spells  matt as he reaches out and his fingers touch the side of your face you feel the muscles tighten  and the skin begin to reform as he pulls away theres still a little bit of reddish rash or  irritation of fresh skin but the scarring seems to have subsided and your face is intact  sam am i handsome again  liam we like you handsome  travis i liked the new way this is old i know this face  sam yeah im sorry im boring i bore you now  /none/ travis just a little bit  sam ill get a tattoo  travis okay  laughter  travis what are we doing now  laura we need to keep going forward either try to make it up this tunnel or we can try going  down that path that the sphere was forming i dont know what that is  travis it didnt go all the way it just started i looked  laura oh okay then we keep going forward  travis i think its a chunnel actually  laura a chunnel  travis yep small difference  laura /none/ whats a chunnel  liam thats a tunnel that goes under the english channel wherever that is  laura so forward then huh wheres everybody at healthwise are you solid  liam im pretty good  travis i guess im all right  laura pike how are you  ashley i think im okay  laura you got hit a couple times in that last fight  ashley i did i think im okay though  laura all right  marisha is this a short rest that were doing  matt thats up to you guys  laura thats up /none/ to us we could take 30 minutes or just keep moving  taliesin lets keep moving forward  travis look i know we havent said it much but pike i am glad you are here i just felt like  saying that  ashley me too i know we have been here this whole time but thank you for instilling confidence in  me yet again  travis yeah no problem  ashley love you grog  travis love you pike  matt all right so you guys are continuing up the staircase  travis yes sneaky fucks in front /none/  matt marching order all right  liam sneaky fucks in front  laura should i do pass without a trace because they might have some inkling suspicion that were on  sam how many more of those do you have  laura well ive got one level two spell left and all my level threes i can cast it at a higher level  because most of my spells are pointless at this point  taliesin ill go behind the twins  sam ill go behind percy  laura im going to cast pass without a trace everybodys got /none/ plus ten to their stealth  travis pike and i got the rear  matt trinket is in your necklace or out now  laura im bamfing him back out  travis but we are being sneaky  laura yeah but weve got pass without a trace  sam famous last words  matt trinket is out and being stealthy  laura yes  matt perfect as you continue up the stone stairway you said you were looking for traps i  figured  liam always  matt slow moving up the steps as you slowly are looking for okay /none/ go for it  liam for traps for investigations that is 18  matt okay you continue up the staircase the steps being wider than the previous ones youve  seen before eventually you pass through the carved tunnel of a cavein up the steps the next  chamber reveals itself naught but 25 feet upwards it opens up you find yourselves standing within a  small building ruin but the walls have fallen around you you can see the bare structure around you  elements of the base floor rubble and broken slate you see around you what must /town/ have been a  oncecolossal courtyard or a commons for the dwarven city of thomara with varying levels and  paths and platforms holding rare types of now petrified leafless trees scattered amongst this  thoroughfare climbing up dozens of feet like frozen bolts of lightning forever reaching in  vain you see deadlittered paths weaving between stout multileveled buildings of thomara make  corpses that have been torn apart and are twitching shifting on their own the occasional  hand pulling its way across whatever bits and pieces of undead here remain they are not  functional they have /none/ been so sundered through the ages or other sort of confrontation and yet are  cursed to forever twitch and wander  your eyes as they focus in on this interior you glance to the opposite side you see the ghost of  this past beauty of the city surrounding you is now currently defiled on a mass scale over half  of this 300footwide cavern appears to have collapsed or is currently crushed under an  invading mass of black earth and rock unlike the rest of the titans interior the familiar smell  of wet earth and ancient /none/ decay is now mixed with another familiar scent of cold ash and iron dust  the smell of the shadowfell  at this distance you can see the rough shape of three carved archways at the base of this inverted  mass of earth that curves down and collapses half of this cavern about 40 or so feet apart you can  see at each of these entrances there are some figures some shapes they are too far from you at  the moment hundreds of feet away from you to make any sort of clear vision but you see /dung/ a few  bits of torchlight in the distance and shifting shadows near those entrances  laura are we in a dark tunnel they cant see us right  matt currently you guys are emerging from underneath in this small rubble there is no  light in here the only bit of light you can see is some of that bioluminescent fungus that you had  in that previous tunnel and the torchlight across the way  laura should we put out your hands so that they cant see us well theres a bunch of people off  in the /none/ distance  liam want me to go take a look youve dusted me im pretty quiet  laura yeah but you have to stay within 30 feet of me  sam 30  laura 30 if you want to keep pass without a trace 60 to stay within the ring  liam id probably be good without it and we could go together about 50 feet away from the group and  then i could go a little bit further and see if i can get a better look  laura lets stick around to the sides  travis vast /none/ space big wide open  matt its a wide space as the cavern opens in this large domelike interior path loosely  kidney bean shaped or a wide oval half of it is currently crushed and occupied by this darker mass  of shadowfell earth  laura its sitting on top of it thats the city the roots of the city crushing down  matt thats the roots of the city crushing down into this chamber  travis could be a rick and morty portal to the shadowfell  matt where the titan ends and thomara begins would be this /none/ particular threshold  laura so we could go up from here this is where we go up you can get that sphere again and tunnel up  sam i have the sphere  laura i know we go straight into the city  matt well the sphere is back in the tunnel with you you can concentrate on it and bring it with  you and it moves at a very slow speed  sam we havent moved very far  laura weve only gone a little bit  sam sure ill bring it as far as weve gone  /none/ matt okay cool so whats your intelligence modifier again  sam now its three  matt three so you can move it 15 feet a round its slower than any of you  sam sure but were just walking here  matt as you make your way up the tunnels this hovering ball of dense death and destruction is  humming  sam simon three  matt humming ominously simon three makes its way  marisha does it make that sound  laura is it noisy  matt it does give off vibration and a noise to it you do /none/ hear the subtle hum  laura how far away from it do we have to be in order to not hear the hum  matt about 80 or so feet  travis thats further than i thought  sam its going to reveal our position isnt it  matt its very faint sound  travis they are a couple hundred feet away  liam you still have silence  taliesin we still have some cloaks  sam we can put one on the sphere  laura no put them on us  sam disguise him put him in a hat /none/ gloves  laura im going to instantly throw a robe over top of scanlan youve got a robe on you now i  put a robe on too  matt okay so you put on a robe and scanlan puts on a robe  laura yeah  matt all right  taliesin they know that the orb was with two of the others so as long as we keep the distance  everything should be fine  sam oh so now were legit  laura yeah we look like were with them  travis hey twins how do our flanks /town/ look if we move forward is it just trees is it buildings  liam i was about to ask we see flickering light far away but i dont trust anything i want to  specifically see if anything besides twitching fingers and toes are hiding closer to us  matt make a perception check  laura and im listening for voices do i hear anything  matt perception check  liam 24  laura oh 19  matt okay between the both of you focusing in the still silence you can hear very faint distant  muttering of conversation briefly /none/ on the left archway but around you aside from the  small skittering of an occasional hand that is crawling its way forward you dont see any  fullbodied undead in fact in comparison to the chamber youd exited more than an hour ago which  had hundreds and hundreds of wandering undead this is mostly vacant of anything that isnt  directly at those archways  liam which are how far away from us  matt theyre about 150 or so feet theyre right at the center part of where the chamber  would be where the earth of /none/ thar amphalas current resting place begins  laura were not within the distance of 80 so they wouldnt be able to hear the orb  sam okay great send it straight at them then  laura definitely  travis laughing super slow  laughter  matt austin powers it  taliesin it could in theory collapse the arches if you were so inclined  travis yeah but were in here  laura we could collapse all the rest of the tunnels and we go straight up into the city  travis its a tiny ball  marisha sounds a bit /none/ like bringing the city to us  taliesin how big is the ball again  matt the ball is about two feet in diameter  taliesin grogs not going to fit in that hole  sam it could curlicue up  taliesin i dont trust you as a sphere artisan  sam but with you by my side your engineering wits and my ballhandling skills well be fine  taliesin as legendary as your ballhandling skills are  travis make a ballhandling check  taliesin roll 2d6  liam i volunteer as tribute  taliesin i dont see how i /none/ could possibly help with this  marisha im afraid it might slow us down  taliesin heres a question if you start thinking of it going in a particular direction does it  keep going in that direction  sam or does it have a radius where it stops listening to me lets give it a shot  taliesin we could send it in a direction  marisha yeah thats fun  laura yeah lets send it off towards one of those torches  marisha destroying everything in its path for forever  sam lets find out right  taliesin /none/ or we could send it straight up  sam im going to concentrate on simon three and send it back the way we came not hitting  anything just to see how far it goes before i lose telekinetic connection with it  matt it continues until its out of sight so it starts digging and burrowing  sam is it still going  matt as soon as you send it downward at an angle it hits the floor and begins carving its own path  tunneling lower and lower  sam how far away is it now  matt /none/ at this point id say its about 70 feet  sam okay come back  matt it begins to slowly come back in your direction  taliesin you finally found a worse pet than trinket well done i love trinket  liam by the way what direction is vecna from us now  matt sourcing it would be upwards at an angle from where you see the base of thar amphala its  in that direction at an upward angle you get the sense that this is near the edge of the city  laura can we see any light /none/ from above us  matt other than the very faint bioluminescence left by the little patches of dull orange here and  there that give you a sense of the overall scope and enclosure of the chamber no other light  source theres no opening  laura so the option is really to keep moving forward and find our way out  travis same option as ten minutes ago  marisha the figures in the distance can we tell by scale how big they are do they look humanoid  or bigger  matt make a perception check  marisha /none/ dont fuck me gil  taliesin to control the sphere is it just will  sam it obeys me because i asserted my dominance  marisha 21  matt the left archway you see two torches being held by two humansized figures humanoid hoods  are down but you cant see at this distance anything beyond the size they appear to be  surrounded by five or more dwarfsize skeletons that are shambling in unison around them in one  uniform movement as they pace around the opening to the archway  the middle archway you see another humanoid figure /none/ but armored you can see the sharp edges  of plated shoulders and a helmet and a few other skeletal figures wandering around but one at the  very very edge of the one torch that it holds you see one large hulking figure about ten or so feet  tall but you only see the very edge you dont actually see the rest of the body all you see is  the edge of the shoulder or the beginning of the side  sam thats one way right  laura theres three ways  matt and then theres the /none/ right archway you can see three smallishlooking humanoid figures two  that are very hunched on hands and legs  have a humanoid silhouette on the head and  shoulders but theyre down on the ground almost like a dog between the two of them there is one  humanoid figure thats still hunched slightly but still standing upright hooded and cloaked  marisha do they appear to be looking for something or are they wandering like a patrol  matt as you watch them for a moment you see they do move a little bit glancing around the  /none/ area keeping a watch but they appear to be stationed there with a minor patrol in the  vicinity  sam can they see each other  matt for the most part they are about 40 feet from each other as there is a curve the right  and the left archway probably have a hard time seeing each other the middle one has a view of  each occasionally theyll interface they converse a bit between the two of them but for  the most part theyre definitely keeping a look out theyre very vigilant and looking out into /none/  the empty space before them  liam seeing which way keyleth is looking vax stands a bit on tiptoe and puts his chin on her shoulder  and looks in the distance and sees the armored figure are we close enough to tell if that  armored figure has a sword  taliesin i can lend the scope of my gun if that helps  matt okay that would probably help make a perception check  travis what is that  taliesin scope  travis yeah  taliesin just a series of lenses  liam 26  matt so /none/ this is the central figure in the armor  liam yeah  matt its wearing similar armor not to the knight you had encountered with vecna more the  blackened armored knight that you had battled at the ziggurat on marquet  sam wait what  matt when you first encountered delilah briarwood and you found the pathway into the shadowfell  marisha is that the same guy  matt well no you murdered that one but its similar set of armor yes  taliesin i let grog look through the scope  travis gasping theyre right here  laughter /none/  taliesin i regret nothing  marisha laughing ashleys face oh no  ashley are you scared  travis look through the scoop look through it what do you see  ashley i just see big guys but i guess everybody looks big to me  laughter  travis pikes so brave so brave  liam through skype its like my niece sat down at the table to start playing  laura can we scry on the death knight or on delilah to see if theyre with vecna right now  because if theyre separate from him then what if /none/ theyre in these chambers  marisha yeah i will use a 5thlevel spell to scry as opposed to the scrying eye does my  scrying eye use my spellcasting ability no its 15  matt its 15 its tied to the item  marisha im going to scry on  travis death knight  laura he probably would be less aware if you scry on delilah  marisha shell alert people to our presence yeah that death knight that seems to be the  righthand man  laura we can scry through the ring right  matt whats the ring /none/ say  laura hold on i have to find it  travis i didnt even think about that  laura band of shrouds while attuned all creatures and their belongings within 60 feet of  the bearer are immune to most divine magics that would locate or reveal the whereabouts of the  creature  matt you can scry outside of it but you cannot scry into it  marisha yeah lets do it  laura most divining magics that doesnt mean were immune to everything  marisha i want to scry on that big guy that was with delilah /dung/ when i saw them walking out  taliesin and marisha armor bro  matt with your spell  marisha with mine  matt okay hold on  taliesin matts finding his murder sheet  liam how are your magical reserves  marisha theyre all right im using my last 5thlevel spell for this  matt you back up into the hallway to find a space that isnt immediately visible and begin to  build the circle of incantation the rest of you keep watch in case anything begins to make its way  toward the entrance as you complete the /dung/ ritual your vision expands and you feel your essence being  pulled up through the earth and rock changing from gray and brown to black and dead until  eventually for a brief instant you see a burst of the city of thar amphala matching precisely  your memory of the inner sanctum of the city  in an instant theres a rush of momentum and energy and you see footsteps you see before you  the death knight that you had previously encountered in the struggle is stepping up these  dark ruddy stone steps one two three you /none/ can hear the echo surround you in this slightly  curving staircase  marisha do i see delilah  matt you do not unfortunately you see a very vague image of a room thats disappearing behind  him as it curves around where you can see two other armored figures similar to the one thats in  the center archway that are standing watch in that chamber they vanish as he curves around and you  watch as he steps up stepstepstep  marisha can i get any other details on where he is can i see any other identifying /none/ landmarks  matt currently its a windowless stairway that curves  marisha is he going upwards  matt yeah  marisha oh hes in a tower  laura well maybe what else does she see  matt you see a sudden swelling of greenishblue light as he reaches the apex of this staircase  you now see the top of the tower exposed where three large hooked stone spires curve inward to a  familiar top of the tower  marisha hes trying to do it again  matt out of the corner of your eye you see the sky /none/ itself from this perspective has this  weird sickly bluegreen tint to it and as you try and focus beyond the proximity of the knight you  get a glimmer of some shape currently gliding in the air above then a voice says no and  laura you were scrying on the death knight not vecna  travis he doesnt know who its from  marisha or where  travis he probably detected it but he doesnt know who or where said the barbarian about the god  matt knowing as youve cast the spell before a creature that can /none/ see invisible objects sees the  sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist creatures that can see invisible can see the  source of a scry spell  sam can see the source  matt not necessarily but they can see that something is scrying on the space as soon as you  kick back youre like shit thats probably what it was  marisha shit thats probably what it was  liam he knows were coming  laura there was that moment when you two were falling to your deaths before we entered the  /dung/ titan you were away from me so its possible that he knows  marisha im sure he knows were around  taliesin do we want to deal with these people or get around them  laura do we see any other tunnels that arent guarded  matt make a perception check  laura whoa thats a big fat no  matt its real dark and you have to travel deeper into the actual cavern space to try and see  any other tunnels  liam theres no peeling around the sides of this theres too much rubble and shit this /none/ huge space  that were in  matt no it encompasses the entire opposite side of this this was at one point a 250 to  300footlong cavern but half of it is entirely occupied by the base of thar amphala  travis couldnt scanlan look like one of the mages we killed and walk up and be like all  clear everybody go home its all done  laura we can totally try that  taliesin what was his name  travis he had a name  laura he did have a name what was the name you wrote /none/ it down  sam the names of the people we killed we know their names  laura yeah you wrote it down  marisha odell  laura odell  marisha tell viscon we have visitors i wrote that in quotes  sam i could be one of them i have an orb of destruction next to me that would seem like his  travis yeah you could walk it up real close and be like  laura be like were going to tunnel in this  one now so move  marisha do you remember what odell looked like  /none/ sam sure we just killed him right  marisha odell seemed to be a more highranking member of vecnas forces  sam which was the one who was  controlling the orb though  liam wait a second scanlan could do that but he cant go by himself we all have to creep along with  him or be found out  sam i wont be alone ill have simon with me  liam we all have to go together so we dont fall out of range of her ring  laura this is true were going to be within /dung/ 60 feet of you very stealthily  liam were all stuck together unfortunately  taliesin can you send them down there  sam send who down where  taliesin the rest of them to help the other we tell them they need help down below in the cavern  where we murdered everybody youre odell viscon might be one of them send them down there to see  if theres a problem then cave them in when they all go  sam how far are they from us  matt theyre about 140 or so feet  liam send who /none/  travis the people who are guarding the archways we trap them with explosives and shit  taliesin how is it that grog is following me right now am i making that little sense  travis always the tone of surmise  marisha how many robes do we have are we going to claim that were there to relieve them of their  shift is that what youre pitching  laura no were going to say were going to tunnel in that area now so they have to clear out  or else theyll be caved in  taliesin we /dung/ send one of us up as odell to tell viscon theres a problem down there and that we need  everybody to help because we found something  travis yeah we heard rumblings down there  laura not people dont let anyone know theres people but theres definitely something  interesting  sam but you people have to be near me when i do this how is that going to happen  taliesin and laura were going to hide  sam is there anything to hide behind  matt its dark and there are a number of dwarven buildings in /none/ various levels of disrepair and  collapsing  laura as we get closer i can use hide in plain sight and camouflage all of us to where they can  walk by us and they wont see us  liam additionally we can play monkey in the middle as long as vex is in the center you can be  50 feet or so ahead and everyone else can be either with vex or back  travis oh this actually sounds like a plan which means it will go terribly  laura theyre 120 feet from us  matt 140 /none/ 150 feet  laura okay well move forward a bit and then i can camouflage all of you  sam wait an actor prepares who am i whats my motivation am i odell if so why does odell have  the sphere with him  laura because hes going to tunnel in that tunnel  travis look odell went to vecna because his wife left him because shes like oh youre not very  powerful and hes like i will find and show you power so you went to vecna and you gouged  your eye out but then your /none/ depth perception is off now so then youre like im going to work  my way up through the ranks  marisha but then you went back and she was like now youre hideous now im not taking you back at all  and you were spiteful so you went back and turned to a life of crime and deceit  sam sure ill show her ill show all of them i like this good backstory  travis pike smack scanlan let him know  ashley i smack him on the butt go get them  sam wait whos viscon /none/ which one is he  laura odell was the one holding the sphere right  marisha yes because one of the other minion guys was like odell go tell viscon  sam yeah but he was running away he wasnt the one holding the sphere  laura odell wasnt holding the sphere  sam it was the green robe guy  marisha whos the green robe guy then  laura gray yeah it was gray hold on i pull it out and look at it yeah it was gray  sam wait we have the actual robe just give me /none/ that  marisha are they written on the tags like a school play  laura yeah does it have his name written in it anywhere so he keeps track of it  matt roll an investigation check  sam property of jimmy  laura oh this is pretty good 24  sam if found return to  marisha property of  matt this is which one  laura this is the gray robe  sam i thought green  laura it was gray the guy that was controlling the orb  marisha you know these people have analretentiveness issues  /none/ laura no the red guy was holding the orb the green guy put up the force wall and ran away  sam so we want the red  laura the red robe im looking at the red robe  marisha because the red robe was odell  laura i dont know we dont know  liam vax starts quietly praying to the raven queen in a corner right now  matt odell is the one that ran off  laura okay so thats not the one we want we want the one in red that was controlling the orb  /none/ matt viskorad  sam did we ever hear his name  matt yes turn back and tell that viskorad found sneaky prey  sam viskorad my name is viskorad  travis do you want to know his backstory  laughter  sam ill just use the same one  marisha viskorad and viscon are two different people  matt i might have missaid it at the moment i was on painkillers  marisha so there is no viscon theres a viscorad  matt viscon i think is the name of an island elsewhere  laughter  taliesin hes looking forward /none/ to vacation when this is all over  sam we know the other one was named odell and hes dead so i can go over to them and say  theyve killed odell  laura no dont say that theres anybody that they need to watch out for dont set them on  alert no tell them you found something interesting and odell is investigating it  sam so they need to go get what  laura they need to go down into the tunnel to help him  sam okay but what is the thing that we found  /none/ taliesin anything youd like  marisha your longlost wedding ring from your past marriage  taliesin not that but yes we found something interesting its strange possibly dangerous  possibly useful  laura you definitely need help for it vecnas going to be thrilled everybodys going to get  promotions  sam odell is still down there he needs some help im going to go talk to vec while they go  help ode right im going to put on my hat of disguise and become as close to that mans form as  i can wait was he a /none/ human was he an elf  matt hes human  sam he was human  laura so we sneak forward trinkets going back into his necklace its too dangerous buddy  sam moles and trolls red leather yellow leather  laura so as soon as we get within a hundred feet of them im going to do hide in plain sight on everybody  and camouflage everybody so that they  matt okay so hide in plain sight and camouflage  laura on top of pass without a trace hide in plain sight  travis we could hide in a /none/ house one of the ruins  marisha weve got camo paint and camo clothes while carrying a bush  matt hide in plain sight is the camouflage youre referring to  laura just to disguise everyone so that theyre super hidden  travis pike can get on my back  matt camouflage you can really only do on yourself  laura i can use my ranger skills to cover people  matt sure you can arnoldschwarzeneggerinpredator  this for other folks  laura were keeping within pass without a trace  matt ill say make a wisdom check  laura /none/ to see if i can actually do it  matt to see how well you manage to mask the terrain nearby  liam i stand ten feet away from her and give her a plus two oh thats so low  laura i know eight  liam plus two  laura oh a wisdom saving throw or a check  matt a check it looks like unfortunately the shale and broken rock in this vicinity its hard  to find anything that would actually help hide them beyond their natural stealth roll so youre  going have to rely on /none/ your pass without a trace  laura so we have to stay within 30 feet of me  taliesin well stay in there were going to get into the ruins and have our guns trained in case  anything goes wrong  laura scanlan stay within 60 feet of me  marisha keyleth finds some black dirt on the ground and gives a war paint  taliesin remember if anything goes wrong its been a pleasure working with you  sam wonderful we have the jenga we can do the jenga  travis youre the only one wholl be saying /none/ jenga pretty much  laura yeah you can do the jenga what do we do if its jenga  sam we kill everyone  taliesin we think well of you and move on  liam im going to stick close to vex in case she needs backup but also if scanlan needs backup  ready to run in  all okay  matt the only person going forward is you  sam yes  marisha wait before he goes i grab him and i cast freedom of movement on him you cant be  grappled  laura can you cast /none/ something to help his charisma and his persuasion  marisha yes actually i can because freedom of movement is not a concentration spell so im  going to burn my last 2ndlevel spell and do enhance ability to give you  matt advantage on charisma checks  marisha peacocks charisma or whatever the fuck its called  matt note you have freedom of movement how long does it last is it an hour  laura an hour  matt so you have freedom of movement for an hour everyone else whos not going forward make a  stealth check please /none/  laura its plus ten  marisha lets do the druid dice oh yeah thats good  liam natural 20 47  sam youre going to be in triple digits soon  taliesin he appears in another game somewhere in deep valley  matt you go back and watch previous episodes and liams not there its really weird  liam somewhere in the future theres an acquisitions inc game going and my head pops in  from the side and then pulls out again  matt i love it perfect  laura i got 43  liam thats pretty good /none/  travis 22  matt pike  ashley 20  matt keyleth  keyleth 32  taliesin 34  matt wow thats some pretty solid rolls guys you all stay as quiet as possible moving along  the exterior of vexs ability to move forward you move forward slowly while keeping scanlan in  sight you slowly begin to move forward with simon three humming slowly in front of you  sam i am going to limp as i go  matt interesting character choice  sam strong choices commit to them a hundred percent  matt you guys are /none/ quietly stepping through and you hear his footfalls echoing and immediately  you see some of the torches shift and theres some talk and some whispering back and forth and a  small shout you watch as some of the skeletal entities at two of the entrances shift and look in  that direction and begin to shamble slowly the two torchbearers on the right begin to move  forward as the armored figure in the center watches on arms crossed what are you doing you  have three archways  sam i go to the one that had that /none/ knight near it right  matt thats the middle one  sam ill go to the middle one im going to keep the ball in front of me to obscure me a little  bit not dead in front of me but its up here just in case hanging my head a little bit ill  go up and say power so much power ive never experienced anything like it before come i need aid  matt make a deception check with advantage  sam okay first one was better ten plus what is this  taliesin and matt deception /none/  sam 28  matt the shambling skeletons to the left of you you can hear the scraping and clacking sound as  their bones rattle and shift across the stone floor pieces of rock being pushed as their feet  drag across the stone dwarven walkways the two torchbearing cloaked figures you can see  approaching and theyre talking amongst themselves one of them is currently holding some sort of a  holy symbol in their hand and theyre starting to glow a bit theyre glaring forward the armored  figure with the arms crossed puts a hand out /none/ like this they both look over and stop and hold in  place the armored figure steps forward you can hear the armored footfalls across the stone the  rot behemoth which you now see emerging behind rot behemoth the entities you saw patrolling thar  amphala and two of them stormed into spriggs house begins to follow behind him  sam so far its going great guys  matt every minute or two you have the vibrating footfall of the titan and a few of the rocks fall  and tumble from the ceiling and a bit of dust /dung/ begins to get knocked free from the highup  ceiling of the cavern  the armored figure approaches gets within about 15 feet of you and stops you see no face this is  magnetostyle theres space for the eyes and the mouth but its too shadowed for you to make any  features out its this dark void you can see the hooked spiked shoulders and the horns built to  come out of the sides of the helmet arms still crossed before what did you say  sam we were tunneling with the orb and we found something /none/ an ancient dwarven artifact it bends  reality it changed things it changed my voice it changed my whole world for a moment its still  down there odell needs help  matt theres a pregnant pause a stillness that causes the back of your neck to grow warm the  nerves begin to creep up the back of your spine instinctually your eyes begin to glance at the  two other archways as you see shapes shifting the armored figure gives a subtle chuckle very  well lead us to this find  sam i have been injured take /none/ the orb go down to where we were down that way i will go get help  for myself odell needs you to help him contain the power  matt the head retracts slightly confused and a bit worried he takes one step onto the back foot  almost like its not sure if it should be close to you or not it raises its hand back towards the  two other torchbearing cloaked figures and goes vislal take the orb one of the hooded figures  steps forward and takes a moment and concentrates the orb jolts towards him /none/ immediately and he  yelps hes going to try again okay with a second try you can see the sweat on his brow as  he begins to step backward like im not really good with this are you relinquishing your  control over it  sam yes  matt so then he focuses for a moment and the orb you can feel the slight bit of will that you  had imposed over it has pulled back the orb begins to push forward slowly in his direction of  choice you can see a smile come across his hairless /none/ older face he nudges the other figure  which you can see is a female halforc who looks heavily scarred across the chin and the side of  the neck and theyre both missing the corresponding eye  they both begin to move forward and slowly push the orb past you the vibration you hear getting  louder in your guys direction as the armored figure begins to follow suit behind the rot  behemoth begins to follow and the armored knight goes keep watch the skeletons begin to move  backward with the rot behemoth now you have the /dung/ heavy footfalls of the large looming rot behemoth  in the center walkway and a handful of skeletons for that approach blockading that as the knight  with the two other hooded figures begin to make their way towards the entrance where you guys rose up  laura you shouldnt have given them the sphere  sam what am i going to do with a fucking sphere  laura yeah but we have to cave it in and theyre going to see  sam wait were supposed to cave in shit  laura were going to cave it in after /none/ them  sam goddamn it why didnt you tell me this plan  laura we did  matt so they begin to walk forward and slowly make their way towards the staircase that you guys  emerged from  sam im not the best at this game  liam so we part like the sea  matt you guys part a bit move around the sides okay you guys keep as quiet as you possibly can  theres a brief moment pike where your arm is on the side of one of the stone walls and a piece of  /none/ rock snaps and breaks to the ground one of the figures with the hood back stops for a second and  goes to look just as one of the titan footfalls impacts and the whole area shakes sending other  rocks tumbling around it seems to be just enough to distract they continue walking forward you  hear the hum of the orb as it slowly makes its way past you faint hint of a doppler you watch them  descend into the ruins that you emerged from down into the tunnel  taliesin so they can only move at /dung/ the speed of the orb since they have the orb with them  sam well they can move faster but they wont have the orb with them  laura should we still cave it in though behind them  taliesin how many creatures are left guarding us  matt currently you still have the cluster of eight skeletons on the left one there are four  skeletons and the rot behemoth in the middle and on the right you still have one humanoid figure  flanked by two hunched humanoid figures  laura we can definitely take the skeletons out /dung/ though and sneak through potentially in that  one tunnel we should still cave this shit in and itll seem like a natural cavein right  marisha skeletons we can handle pretty easily so wait its 12 skeletons one rot behemoth and two  sam dont you think the thing that the big thing is guarding is the better path  laura probably  matt there are eight skeletons on the left path four skeletons and the rot behemoth in the center  and then one humanoid figure with two crouched humanoid figures on the right  marisha one humanoid /dung/ two crouched figures okay  liam how spread out are those three groupings  matt theyre about 40 or 50 feet from each other around a curved outcropping from your  perspective its around this the center can see both the right and left probably cant see each  other too well its dark and theres a vanishing point around the curve where the far ends cant  make eye contact  taliesin humanoids are the big problem  travis but they can both see the middle  matt they can both see the middle yeah  marisha out of /dung/ all of these the human with the two crouched things is what im most worried  about  travis because we dont know what it is  marisha well and humans have common sense  travis do we have a way to alienate these three that are walking to go see odell do we or do we not  taliesin we have the gem  travis but we dont know what it does  taliesin it may make the undead move towards it  laura and marisha thats true  laura but should we cave in this fucking tunnel so /dung/ that they cant come back through  marisha how wide are the tunnel entrances  matt theyre about 12 feet wide and about ten feet tall and when i say theyre archestheres  simple stone placed and then built around to maintain an arch but theyve been fairly recently  constructed and its more like the very basic beginnings of a mine shaft it looks like these  tunnels were carved probably once thar amphala arrived above the titan so theyre not extremely  stable but theyre stable enough for passage in and out  sam the guy who talked /none/ to me is he still here  matt he went with the orb  sam okay which archway did he come from  laura and matt the middle  sam okay im going to go up to the middle one and say excuse me big fellow i have to get by  matt make a deception check with advantage still  laura dont go too far from me  sam 25  matt 25 the rot behemoth glances at you you see its large metal cagelike helmet that guards its  sunken head that rests squarely in the center of /none/ its chest at this point the smell emanating from  it is this awful combination of rot and longputrid milk you can see no face behind the  mask just glowing red coals for eyes as it watches you as you pass it doesnt make any  motion  sam im going to go in through the archway  laura dont keep walking fucking away from me  sam im going to go a few feet in do i see anything  matt you can see it seems to curve upward  sam its stairs  matt its not stairs /none/ it looks like the interior of this was made with a sphere of annihilation  like someone had taken a while because theres no dirt theres no mounds of dirt around it it  looks like someone had been carefully carving this path you get the sense this sphere has been a  utility object since they arrived  sam how far can i get before im away from 60 feet  matt you have no idea where she is  sam well i must have gone with them and then gone forward  matt well they have to follow /none/ you  laura every time you move forward i have to move forward  sam well you better fucking move forward no im at the threshold of the entrance  matt you walk about three feet past the behemoth and stop  sam i take a knee groans  matt it slowly turns towards you  sam im okay i just need a second whispering whats going on  taliesin move the behemoth away  sam whats going on with my brain groans whats the plan  taliesin move the behemoth away  sam okay you can do this man /none/ stand up whispering lead him away where  liam convince it that the people we sent away need it  sam ill start back i go back through and i say no its too dangerous they need help down there  i fall down to one knee again and say ugh damn these legs you must go help them theyll die  down there cant you see its getting worse the pain  liam is that the dms face or the creatures  matt probably both  laughter  matt make a straight charisma check you have advantage because of /none/ the spell you would  sam just charisma  matt just charisma bonus charisma modifier  sam 23  matt okay thats all youre going to leave it at 23  laura you can inspire yourself  sam wouldnt it seem odd if i started singing to myself  laura what if youre crazy  travis youre in a fever dream  taliesin i can assist in your inspiration  sam how youre 60 feet away from me  taliesin can i assist in his inspiration  matt anything you do to assist will reveal you from stealth  taliesin /none/ including casting a spell  matt oh yeah  sam sure ill inspire myself why not oh i get to roll something  matt roll a d12 and add that to your 23  sam ooh another eight  matt eight onto that so a 31 theres another long pause generally an entity like this is  tethered to the will of one creature in most circumstances it would not take any orders from  anybody outside of it but somehow your words get it to consider in its simplistic undead mind that  if its master is in danger /none/ then obviously the master would want help  sam thats robotics law one right  matt somehow your force of words circumvent the tethered command and the behemoth begins to  hulkingly make its way with the four other skeletons walking with the skittering of the  skeletons away towards where its master disappeared  laura im going to wait until it passes by me to whisper into my earring whispering maybe if we  all go down the middle tunnel then we can collapse that tunnel behind us  marisha instead of collapsing three tunnels  laura yeah we /none/ make a run for it and then collapse the tunnel because the other two tunnels  are going to see us once we get in the middle  marisha okay yeah im into this do people have abilities to make sure these people stay back and  dont rush us while we get through  sam theyre idiots just go  marisha but theres a person thing  laura we stealth around the other side  marisha yeah because the skeletons are better to deal with  travis are you talking about collapsing the middle tunnel  sam that were /none/ about to go into  travis should we entertain the idea of collapsing the tunnel that we sent everybody to but all the  danger the majority of it is behind us  taliesin we can stealthkill these humans super quick  laura can you collapse the one they went down then well collapse ours too because the thing  is a sphere that can  travis even if you can just get the one all of them coming back or chasing us is going to be a  bitch even if it just slows them down  marisha this /none/ is all pretty much unworked stone for the most part since you said it was all  selfcarved its pretty rough  matt yeah its natural earth and stone as natural as the shadowfells slate and rock is  its unworked for the most part  marisha i could go earth elemental go into the walls collapse tunnel a you guys make a run from  it i can earthglide through the walls get to the middle as soon as you guys get through and  collapse second tunnel but it might take a little bit i dont know  /none/ sam what about the 60feet thing  taliesin we have to wait for the first wall to collapse then we may run  travis make a run for it  marisha and ill collapse tunnel one  laura collapse tunnel one  marisha how far away is tunnel one right now  matt tunnel one the one with the eight skeletons  marisha no the one we came from  matt oh that one with you guys having to keep at the 60foot radius with scanlan its about 80  or so feet behind you  liam another option you /none/ said that these three passageways they curve this way and that the two  on the sides dont have a really good look at each other right on the left is a bunch of undead  fuckers right and on the right weve got a humanoid and two little crunched over guys right  so youve got that silence doohickey and us so we could bet it all on stealthkills and creep in  and go leave it all behind one in the middles now empty one on the left over around the corner  is undead  sam who /none/ are you going to stealthkill  liam humanoid and two creepycrawly guys if it pans out we take them out and the skeletons over  there cant see over here if we are quick and then we go  taliesin well i would say collapse the tunnel then go  laura we still have to collapse the tunnel  liam all right but kill them and then make a loud noise because as soon as we start shit  rumbling everybody gets paranoid and upset  taliesin wed have to be lucky  sam theyre probably getting down to odell /none/ at this point we should hurry  marisha i can throw up a wall of stone to block the tunnel we came from and then we go and we do  the other stuff  laura lets do it and go  marisha okay im burning the last of my shit 6thlevel spell wall of stone  laura and marisha the tunnel we came from  matt so you create a stone over that entrance  laura yes once theyre all in there we block them in  marisha we block it up completely  travis if theyre all in /none/ there  matt yeah theyve all been in there for about two minutes at this point  liam can we say that the twins and freddie have been ready to go as you cast and make our move on  these three on the side  matt sure are you going for the three humanoids  liam yes  laura are you sure those seem like the most powerful ones  taliesin thats why we stealthkill them now  liam stealthkill them and get the drop  laura so after thats up we all move as a group in that /none/ direction so were within 60 feet of each  other  marisha well my spell is going to make noise right should you guys stealthkill first  taliesin we could go for surprise kill if we want  liam thats what im saying  matt so youre waiting for them you hold off you talk you guys move over stealthily  marisha i stay with them as far as i can  matt they dont seem to notice your approach just the two of you  taliesin yeah im at great distance  laura what do they look like from /none/ this distance  matt you see theres one hooded figure hood up holding a torch with one hand but the torch is up  above so the shadow cast youre not really able to make out any features or so you can see the  faint side of an older female face thats all you can make out and you see two shadow ghasts the  creatures that you saw leaping from rooftop to rooftop in thar amphala and one of them you  captured briefly at spriggs house theyre both on chained necklacelike chokers being held in  the /none/ other hand of this individual like dogs  laura so we should kill her  liam i guess ill start with her then the ghasts im going to assassinate this woman  hopefully flickflick on her  matt roll an attack both of you guys  laura wait is it an automatic crit because its surprise  liam yes  laura sweet so 30 for attack  matt 30 awesome why is my music not working 30 definitely hits for you vax  liam thats 25 and 23  matt all hit  liam here we go im going to /none/ dump a smite into it as well  laura 19 times two is 28 plus eight is 36 damage on my first arrow  matt all righty  laura second attack  travis 19 times two is what  laura no 38 19 times two is 38 plus eight 46  matt there you go 46 damage  liam first dagger to strike does 88  matt so the humanoid figure in the center holding the torch all you see is them drop back to the  ground as the chains clank to the ground the torch clatters and you /none/ see the light shift and  flicker the two shadow ghasts immediately look in your direction  laura yep that was one so for my second arrow  matt then the wall of stone goes over and covers the top and you start catching up to the rest of  the group grog pike youre running to catch up with vex and vax youre making the second  strike  liam yeah i threw two daggers as part of the surprise  matt go ahead this is against which shadow ghast the left or right  laura im going left /none/  liam you fired to the left or the right  matt you dont know  liam im going to fire at the same one that my sister does  laura so 31 to hit  matt all right that hits whatd you roll vax to hit  liam it was earlier i did it they both hit it was 20something  laura 19 on the left  liam just seven for me though and thats all im going to do  matt all righty then you are shooting  taliesin first one is 32 to hit  matt that /none/ hits  taliesin second shot is 28 to hit first shot is terrible its 12 points of damage i dont have  surprise bonus at all do i  matt no because at this point theyve already been made aware  taliesin second shot is oh my god what a terrible roll ten points of damage nope im so  sorry thats not nearly as bad as i thought it was 16 points of damage thats way better that  seven looked like a one  matt yeah thats enough second shot destroys most of the upper body of the /none/ shadow ghast on the  left the loud gunshots going off in the cavern echoes and you see the skeletons beginning to  shift from the other hallway toward the direction the gunshots came from  taliesin im booking it  matt as you guys are rushing up you manage to catch up to the rest of them as the final shadow  ghast snarls and it only sees currently the two of you its going to run forward and its going to  move here even at its full distance it gets right up next to you but its /none/ not going to be  able to attack unfortunately it uses its full movement and runs toward you with an unnatural  speed and it leaps and lands on you with its claws grabbing your chest and you begin to fall back and  start to catch yourself  liam stab stab stab  matt go ahead and make your attacks the rest of you manage to catch up to the group  taliesin running up to the center tunnel  matt everyone else running up to the center tunnel  marisha center tunnel go  matt as you guys /none/ approach you hit the tunnel and begin to move inside as eight skeletons begin to  curve around the corner  marisha are we all in  matt no currently shes still being assaulted by a shadow ghast  sam im still at the door and ill say no get away from me you interlopers evildoers thats  right you infiltrator screams  matt perfect youre stabbing at the guy thats got her  liam 40 for the first second one is a seven no its 17 for the second one and the last is a  crit and that /dung/ is eight  matt thatll do it actually as you repeatedly jab your dagger into the back of it its tongue is  lashing out and its claws are trying to sink into her armor cant seem to find any purchase on her  flesh the horrible smell of its breath is on you as you watch as dark blood spatters out of its  mouth on you as its being stabbed to death on top of you the weight pushes you onto your back and  you crumple onto the ground as it goes limp you have to shove /none/ it off of you  liam i take whisper and the venom dagger and lift it by the head off her  laura thanks  matt as you guys are getting up to do this action the rest of you made it up to the tunnel  and you can see as the eight skeletons begin to turn around the corner and begin hacking at the  slowest whos there which is going to be pike so pike you get four skeletons that are able to  attack you at this entrance way  ashley thats okay  marisha shes /none/ got this shit shes a cleric shes a monster  matt 13 misses misses misses they all miss theyre scratching at your armor  ashley im almost there  matt you guys run past the skeletons  laura yeah because were going to tunnel this shit anyways right  taliesin i think were going to all get in and then grog im going to have you punch the  darkness  travis sure  matt all right so you guys all continue to run in as you guys run past pike four attacks of  opportunity on you from the /none/ ones that were attacking you  15 no no 17 no whats your armor class  ashley 23  matt 19 it rolled naturally plus four equals 23 one has managed to finally get to you it  swings up with its shortsword at you and you take eight points of piercing damage one of the  skeletal shortswords strikes across the back of your armor it glides off and catches you in the  edge of the ear and youre like yelps but you guys continue to run into this are you running  with them  ashley i /none/ want to attack them so bad but i know we need to go  sam ill run but ill say no no dont take me with you i need to stay here  taliesin youre our hostage now  matt as youre shouting this to skeletons you glance off over the back of your shoulder and you  see a bit of torchlight emerge as a black orb burns through a stone wall  marisha lets go  travis i wait until everybodys through and do i see a crack or nice weakened part in the archway  that i /none/ can smack  matt make an investigation check you put your hand through to find a specific place  travis hold onto your butts 13  matt 13 maybe  travis i like the maybe i rear back and hit the fucking shit out of it  matt all right go ahead and roll  travis reckless thats nice 24  matt 24 that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis what do i roll 1d4  matt 1d4 with the gauntlets then add your strength modifier  travis oh thats a one nine  matt all right as /none/ you slam your fist into the wall part of it breaks and cracks and you can see  earth begin to fall and filter in and its not enough to take it down you can hear multiple  skeleton voices and you see a bunch of them rushing up the hallway at you  laura can i shoot the skeletons that are approaching  taliesin im going to shoot as well  matt okay both of you guys take fire throw your second punch  laura 26 and 27 to hit  talisien 25 and 28  matt all hit /none/  travis 12 24  matt 24 points of damage right as you guys all fire and begin to prepare your weapons you strike  with your arrows with your gun blast with your daggers as the top of the cavern caves in  swallowing whatever projectiles you were throwing as well as closing off the entranceway you can  see now as it falls forward parts begins to shift  marisha run  travis i pick up pike and we start running  matt okay so youre grabbing pike by the back of the armor and you guys are /none/ rushing it is starting  to collapse and fall behind you at that moment you feel the low subvibration of another  titan footfall at that point it sends the rest of this cavern into a more rapid collapse as you can  hear the cracking sound of the rocks behind you grog make a dexterity saving throw  travis i have advantage on those its okay  liam if were all running together he gets plus two from me if hes within ten feet  matt you guys are probably a little bit higher up than him  travis /none/ 17  matt 17 as youre moving forward and youre rushing some of the rocks begin to slam into you  both you and pike suffer seven points of bludgeoning damage the impact of rocks make an  athletics check  travis 23  matt yeah the rocks begin to collapse around you and they begin to pin your body but the physical  strength you have manages to break through and you are not held in the collapsing tunnel beginning to  push forward you all begin to rush slowly the sound of the collapsing tunnel subsides as you /none/  begin to glance upward and see the color of greenblue light approaching  sam approaching us or were approaching it  laura we can see the sky and were causing the collapse behind us were up at thar amphala can  we slow down at all or do we have to keep booking it to avoid the cavein  matt make a perception check  laura 18  matt it sounds like the crumbling noises have begun to subside and all you can hear now is the  slow resting and easing to existing loose rubble and rock the /none/ slow clattering behind you  laura so we can slow down  matt you guys can slow down youre about 15 feet from the surface at this point  taliesin very carefully see whats up there and find some cover  laura i still got pass without a trace because i didnt cast hunters mark  sam who are you people what do you want with me  travis i reach over to scanlan and i rip his hair off  matt you reach out and your hand passes through nothing  travis that is a great hat  liam /none/ i got a new 45 stealth check so im going to go peek were level 19 im level 19 yall  matt you peek up past the edge the sky above you glows a sickly teal color as the darkened storm  above is obscured by the crackle of the arcane barrier that encases the city glancing at the  size of the barrier and the points of origin you can see that only the inner portion of thar  amphala is here the inner wall and everything within the outer regions were left in the  shadowfell when it /none/ was transported  peppered shifting shapes of winged black clusters of creatures scan the sky above dozens and dozens  of gloomstalkers seeking any sight of intruders across the enclosed atmosphere of this arcane  dome in the distance you can see the terrible spire of entropis standing once more a weblike  network of greenish energy fork like veins across the exterior to hold the structure firm  a muffled boom is heard you glance up and see from the outside of this dome an explosion burst  across the magical barrier harmless then dissipates squinting hard you can /none/ make out  obscured shapes of wyvern riders swarming and circling the outside of the barrier  laura is there any city on the way to vasselheim  matt well you traveled with wyvern riders you dont know how many there are but do note that  you did travel with wyvern riders tossing occasional weapons that bounce off and shatter  with sparks across this barrier nothing is coming through and theyre trying to find a weak point  somewhere of what is encasing this currently no help to you in your circumstance  you see a massive skyship /none/ hovering far above thats unable to do anything and is staying far  enough out of reach to not unfortunately fall  laura we have to get these shields down  matt you catch a flashing glance of a huge winged beast streak across the top of the barrier a  glittering brass dragon an arcing blast of arcane energy fires from the barrier striking jmon sa  ord who briefly jolts from the impact but barely changes course to curve away and out of sight  as your vision now begins to focus down to the city around you /town/ you can see the mostly intact  buildings you recall from your last jaunt through thar amphala the interior of the city is less  wardamaged from past history frays  here you stand and heres where were going to take a break well return here in a few minutes  we have a video at the break to get you guys ready for the wyrmwood giveaway once again help out  with the

and the current  circumstance what do you do  laura vax does it /none/ look like anyone has noticed the noise coming from this tunnel  liam i was about to assess that couple of questions one how far is the tower from where we  are right now  matt you guys are maybe 150 feet or so from the edge so youre toward the side of the city the  tower is in the very center so its maybe half a mile from you its not half a mile half a mile  is ridiculous no its maybe 400 feet from you  liam am i able to tell if this is /none/ a giant domedin city are we in a little corner of it or  are we coming up somewhere midrange  matt if you were to look out at it from an overhead circle view from the center youre a  little ways near the edge  liam okay so not right against it  matt yeah youre about 150 feet from the edge  liam how close are the nearest of the gloomstalkers flying around  matt at this point looking up you see about three or four that are maybe 70 or 80 feet above  you but /none/ theyre doing passes theyre not being stationary and theyre constantly circling  through as you glance up and look and nudge away you can see their yellow eyes piercing from their  black lightless form their wings as they expand and shift you can see that faint glance the  beams of their vision scanning across the rooftops theyre all very intent on seeing whats  going through the city  liam and do i see any motherfuckers on the streets  matt make a perception check  liam yeah use the colville die the meteorite its pretty good its /town/ 29  matt 29 okay couple things one as you glance through the streets you can see now why the top  chamber of thomara was so bereft of undead theyve all been moved topside you see glancing  through the bits of street that you have in visual range maybe 35 to 40 dwarven undead that are  wandering through open spaces mixing with the various soldiers from battles long past when thar  amphala still existed in the shadowfell youve encountered those undead already  you also glance around past the gloomstalkers as youre keeping an eye as /town/ youre scanning through  the crowds you see something different larger flying through the skies on the opposite end of  the dome it appears winged with a tail but porous like a tattered sail or a ladder a  skeletal beast of long neck and tail makes a baneful circle over the city with burning  greenblue eyes  liam is it dragonshaped  matt its kind of dragonshaped  marisha its daenerys dragon  matt it appears to be skeletal there is no flesh with what little bit of look you can see  you can see the /none/ light behind the dome is  laura how is it even flying  liam is there any color to it other than dead  matt not bleachedwhite bone but yellowish offwhite bone with various shades of rot to it  its coasting around and you get one view of it as it begins to spin you get a faint distant glance  at it you only see one but it is apparently also making its path over the city with the rest of the  gloomstalkers it does have stretched bits of broken leftover flesh and leather that are  /none/ tattered in places  liam do me a favor and stay down there its a real party up here and everybodys dead  travis i like parties  liam there is a dead dragon in the sky and theres a lot of dead dwarves and other various  types and those things that scanlan charmed a few days ago it is really shitty up here so stay put  laura do any of them seem to have noticed this tunnel  liam i dont believe so  laura then come back down here  liam i back slowly the 15 /none/ feet that i traveled  laura so whats the plan here guys  travis i dont know how much further we have but we really need that sword right we still have  not seen the sword of kas  taliesin ive been thinking about that  travis oh good  taliesin i havent come up with anything no we could try and find the object there are legends  that say that the sword was lost somewhere near the city we are for as much of a moving still  in the earth somewhere near the city we could /none/ find the sword  laura potentially  marisha yeah maybe its in the dirt that we just came by  taliesin i really hope we dont have to go back down there but maybe that might have been what  they were searching for  liam you can scry on people can you scry on things  marisha i can i dont currently have locate object with me  laura i have locate object  marisha i can give my scrying eye to vex  laura so that we can see it so we can locate it  travis oh /none/ because we havent seen it yet  marisha i dont know what it looks like unless we have seen it in which case i still dont know  what it looks like  travis i think the death knight was holding the sword of kas  laura well well find out when we scry on it wont we  marisha i pull out the scrying eye toss it to vex  matt have you scryed before  laura i havent  travis oh shit you about to ride the matrix girl you about to plug in  sam your first /none/ times always disappointing  marisha you can have these rushes you know it can get a little intense youll be great yeah  try and focus real hard though  laura i focus on the sword of kas  marisha yes and try and keep your mind clear and on the sword or else youll get other weird  interference  laura im thinking of so many other things but im really trying to focus on this sword okay  penises dicks no sword of kas sword  marisha its very phallic but sword  matt all right so as /dung/ you glance into this crystalline sphere your vision begins to go dark  at the edges tunnel vision begins to slowly swell and take your view your breath quickens its a  really uncomfortable and unfamiliar feeling but as your vision goes tunnel into the sphere the  coloration and the diffraction of the little bit of light and vision you have in this tunnel go  cloudy and blur the tunnel vision withdraws it gets darker and darker and you can see before you  a hilt of some sort of black blade its beautiful and hooked in places /none/ its surrounded by muck  its surrounded by what you get a sense of but theres no open space around it it is in some  thick molasseslike silt  laura its buried does it seem like the dirt that surrounds the shadowfell is it that kind of dirt  matt its the same color theres no light in the vicinity you can sense its there but you do  sense that the earth around it is not super hard there is a dampness when i say silt  laura oh no now im thinking of dicks again hold on /dung/ sword  marisha focus vex focus  travis big black sword  laughter  taliesin were going to die  matt it seems to be submerged somewhere  laughter  sam children  laura im focusing  matt so you see it before you but because its seemingly buried in this area of damp rock and  silt you have no other idea of where it is  laura okay but i did get a good look at it at least  matt as much as the scry spell can employ yes  laura okay all right thanks stone it /none/ was not being held by that knight no it was buried  somewhere  marisha i told you it was where we just walked by i dont know if thats true  laura im going to give vax a super detailed description i dont know if it helps but i know  we can both cast locate object  liam yeah but you saw it  laura yeah but im giving you a really detailed description  liam but i didnt see it  laura were twins look into my mind  liam you have the spell yeah so you /none/ should do it  marisha can i have my scrying eye back  laura have you scryed on any of us without us knowing  travis you can admit it its okay come clean  taliesin shes a terrible liar wed know  marisha i wanted to scry on scanlan but then grog wouldnt let me  sam why would you want to scry on me  laura oh when you were missing and we didnt know if you were safe or not  sam if you did you wouldve seen this a big black sword  travis is that /none/ what you call big  sam im a little guy look its bigger than my mug  marisha did you really paint mythcarver black why would you do that  sam for a joke  laura okay im going to cast locate object and envision the sword of kas to see if its around  us i cast it at 3rd level though because i used up all my 2nd  matt okay within a thousand feet of you okay  sam is it a roll no its a thing that happens  matt in a brief instant you close /none/ your eyes recite the incantation snap your fingers as you  do from behind your closed lids you immediately feel this draw this sense this direction it is  not moving it is stationary it is  marisha 3000 miles away  matt no its within a thousand miles let me see sense the direction so you know the  direction of it at all times you dont know quite how far from you it is you sense its lateral and  down from where you are deeper toward the city but at a downward angle  laura so underground /none/ so we dont have to go above ground to find it do you guys want to spend  time getting this sword  taliesin it would be advantageous  travis do we really need it  laura its super important to fighting vecna  travis we had the ability to tunnel through earth but this guy let it go  sam who are you people let me go im innocent  marisha your wife left you  sam oh thats true fake sobbing that is my backstory  laura what about the earth elemental thing that you were going to /none/ do can you still do that and  tunnel with that  marisha that lets me glide through earth it doesnt let me tunnel i can do a move earth  spell  laura you cant take me with you if you glide through the earth can you  marisha you would die you would suffocate and be crushed from the pressure of the earth  travis unless you wanted to hop in the necklace and give it to her in the elemental form  sam but you wouldnt be able to help her find it in a necklace  /none/ laura its that direction  sam is it the direction that we came from or the direction that we are going but down  matt the direction youre going but down  taliesin like hopping earth orbit  sam we dont know if theres even any catacombs or anything down there it could be buried in  solid earth  laura which is why keyleth is clutch  sam and it could be a thousand feet down  travis thats probably what they were looking for  taliesin its probably what they were digging for  travis but they were /none/ going the wrong way  taliesin i can keep blowing his mind like this its quite nice  marisha okay all right shit do you know how close it is  laura its within a thousand feet right yeah no i only sense things within a thousand feet  taliesin how much of a problem is the move earth and how far can we go a thousand feet with the  move earth  laura what if i point keyleth in the direction can you glide as an earth elemental and find it  that way  matt do consider /none/ once you do find it the sword cannot earthglide with you  laura oh it cant  sam if only we had some sort of sphere  laura if only somebody hadnt sent it away which is by the way chasing behind us still  matt yeah probably  sam shit but when it catches up to us well take it back  laura maybe see if you can sense it right now see if you can take it back right now  sam simon answer your master i cant  laura keep trying  matt the spell only lasts /none/ for up to ten minutes by the way  taliesin we have to move quick  matt so youve got to move quick  laura im going to have to keep casting it  marisha all right heres the thing i have an 8thlevel spell left and i have a 9thlevel spell  left i want to save one of those i can move earth and make 40foot tunnels for up to two hours  as i go  liam do we have the gate stones both of them  sam yeah gate stones theyre not gate stones  laura /none/ whatever but yeah  liam do we have them  sam i have one  liam i have a great idea but itd take a little time i have a little tub of oil that makes you  ethereal and if one of us you me whoever travels through the ethereal plane and walks down  to the sword and waits with it and then pops back into the material plane  sam underground  liam finds it and then waits somewhere  laura ive got another idea but your idea led to this idea its a building process what /none/ if  keyleth took one of the gate stones glided down there as an earth elemental grabbed the sword  and then bamfed back to us  marisha would that work  sam shed have to become a different form  laura an earth elemental  travis in your ethereal idea do you leave your physical body and your stuff  liam no im on a different plane parallel to this one  sam shed become an earth elemental in solid earth  taliesin it takes a minute to activate the stone though you would be down there thats the /none/  problem  laura thats why keyleth could do it  marisha yeah but the voice from above said i cant glide the sword with me but i should be  able to grab it and then concentrate  sam and change your form into an earth elemental  marisha well ill already be an earth elemental and ill have the gate stone  liam do you have any sense of if its buried very deep or is it sitting in a puddle of shit  laura i can send her in a direction  liam we dont know though /none/  marisha all right this is a good plan what if we combine plans because etherealness can let you  glide through your plane right its a glidey thing but for all things right so can you take  the potion piggyback on me we glide together get the sword  liam she would not be able to hold onto it  laura but i would help her find it  sam but you would be a mist how would you tell her anything  taliesin she would follow her  sam how are you going to see  marisha /none/ weve got our awesome telekinetic earrings  matt you still have to whisper in the earring  liam theyre two different dimensions its two different planes but if you or i with locate  object douse ourselves in this oil and we locate the object we know exactly where it is and we  move toward it and then go down there it might be encased in a ton of stone or something we dont  know we could go toward it find it and then go sit 20 or 30 feet away from it wait to pop back  /none/ into this plane go grab it gate stone up here  travis thats not a terrible idea if your stuff works that way  sam and if you can find a place to pop back into existence 30 feet away  marisha and i can make tunnels though as long as i go with you i cant find it alone i can get  close  travis its also super loud and moves a lot of stuff and shit collapses  liam also i should try to do it because if i come back in a wall of stone it /none/ doesnt matter  travis all in favor of the ethereal idea raise your hands  laura how long does it last  liam an hour  travis all in favor of the earthglide elemental raise your hand  marisha wait i thought we had to have more or less both though  laura we have to have both  liam why we have the gate stone ethereal will take me down toward the thing i wait by it pop  back into material pick it up gate stone back  travis is gate stone immediate  liam it takes a /none/ minute to do  marisha thats not how earth works though you cant wait down there and then switch back and  then think you can grab this  liam we dont know that were going through solid earth it could be sitting in a footdeep puddle  of muck in a cavern somewhere its not like it was teleported into a solid mountain  marisha if it was sitting under a foot deep of muck someone would have found it by now  liam weve been stealthing for not too much space i think that i could get pretty /none/ far  sam but she knows where it is  liam well i could do the same thing that she did  sam all right do it  marisha but she knows what it looks like  liam if you hand me that bauble again i can do the same thing  matt unfortunately its already been used  travis youve got to let vex go  liam that is hilarious  marisha its got to be a vex and kiki thats the thing its got to be both of us  taliesin can you follow her  sam no /none/ she cannot she wont be able to see her if youre ethereal youre in a different plane  marisha youre stealthy as fuck we can get there get close enough get above it and then  travis youre talking about going in the open air risking the open air to get closer  marisha shes stealthy as fuck and i can glide under the dirt  travis leaves a lot of room for a bad roll  taliesin or we make a tunnel and we all go  sam why dont you go find it and come back and tell /none/ us  liam lets try your idea you thought that i would be able to locate it by you telling me about  it so what did it look like  laura i explain exactly what it looked like  liam awesome im going to cast locate object right now  matt okay as you cast the spell you close your eyes and snap your fingers it cant find  anything unfortunately you have to have seen the object for the spell to have an effect  liam no im not upset at you im upset at laura because this /none/ was my idea on the break and  it got yanked from me but what are you going to do im not upset its fine im taking my  marbles and going home  travis so how long can you tunnel and how long in each tunneling thing  laura plus if i give you a direction you can tunnel in that direction you can earthglide in  that direction until you find the sword grab a hold of it and try to bamf back lets try that  travis or tunnel back  marisha with you telling me where /none/ it is  laura ill point you in a direction  liam whats the range on the earring  marisha yeah can she guide me through  liam wait the ring within 60 feet of each other all of this was a waste of time  taliesin tunnel  marisha all right i tunnel then fucking hell  matt this was so much dnd right there all the dnd everyone whos ever played dnd is right now  going yep ive been there all right so whats the plan  laura we tunnel towards the fucking sword  taliesin we /none/ collapse the tunnels behind us  travis pike and i charge out of the tunnel  taliesin you lead us we go straight there less than a thousand feet  sam okay lets go  taliesin i know that this is burning but weve got no choice  laura we know the direction go in that direction  marisha are we going to try and go above or are we tunnelling all the way there  laura in the direction that im pointing tunnel that way  marisha im going to burn my 8thlevel spell on move earth i still /none/ have a 9th and then this is  reaching the end of my shit  matt all right so this lasts up to two hours concentration and you can move a 40foot space to  create a tunnel every ten minutes  sam every ten minutes thats useless  taliesin under a thousand feet  sam the locate object only lasts ten minutes  liam its within a thousand feet  laura and then i can cast it again twice i have two more times to cast it  liam a thousand feet is not that far  travis did /none/ you say 40 feet  sam and marisha every ten minutes  travis and weve got three of those so were going 120 feet  laura no she can keep going that direction and then ill cast it again in a little bit  taliesin thats assuming we hit no pockets  sam 240 feet that gets us 480 total feet possible in two hours halfway  liam its more likely that this thing is sitting in a pool of stilted water its probably not  encased in a passageway of stone because how did it get there  marisha /none/ if thats the case we have to move on foot above ground quickly and get close and then  i can tunnel us down i think thats the only way other than that were taking several hours to get  there at a very slow pace  sam and we might not get there  travis two dozen plus things flying around pike and i are going to roll some stealth checks itll  be great  taliesin all right fuck  marisha wait  all wait  taliesin laughs does anybody know that joke outside of this room wait /none/ thats right we  instagrammed it  marisha scanlan you still have a mansion  sam i do  marisha we could break this up scanlan casts the mansion we split the party and we have a stealth  team go get the sword and come back  liam and vecna knows where we are  marisha if theyre in the mansion though  laura you cant sense anybody in the mansion  marisha he cant sense anyone in the mansion so we cast the mansion while youre still here half  the party goes in team stealth sword recovery /none/ plan goes out gets the sword while the rest of  the team camps in the mansion  travis if theres anything around that sword when you get there youre on your own  laura then we go away we dont try to fight it  marisha unless we all want to decide right here and right now to try and get closer to the sword  than the thousand feet we are potentially away from it right now together as a team and then  cast the mansion or not at all  travis laughs this is craziness i /none/ think there is an upside to pike and i not having to roll  those stealth checks even with pass without a trace but if theres anything around that sword  its going to be up to you to either fight it and get the sword or get the fuck out  laura avoid it yeah  travis you want to do that  sam stealth team is not me right its you two  marisha itd be us two and maybe vax as well  travis corner three  liam im not that stealthy  laura lets do it /none/  marisha does anyone have a better plan is this what were going with  ashley and travis do it  matt okay then  sam were also committing that this is where the mansion is going to live for the night is this a  good spot for it  laura the sphere is coming out soon  matt keyleth vex you feel a very faint vibration in the ground  marisha does the sphere fuck up the mansion  taliesin its a disintegration spell  laura probably we need to get out  sam no the mansion cant /none/ be seen they would have to know that its there  travis even if it accidentally hits it its toast  sam well we can hide it behind a closet or something  taliesin theres no closet were in a tiny tunnel  sam i always carry a closet with me  taliesin we know  matt what are you doing guys  laura lets peek up is anything near us right now  marisha and whatever the closest building is closest to the sword  matt all right so you guys all emerge out into the open light  /town/ laura no we dont we peek up first to see if anythings near us  matt make a perception check  marisha who all of us  matt no just the ones who are looking  laura 27  liam 31  matt okay the two of you glance off as youre emerging your exiting point looks to be a hole in  the middle of a street that has been dug down from this point you can see theres a nearby  building maybe 20 feet from you that is a twostory building that is partially collapsed  but /none/ still mostly intact  laura is there anything around  matt yeah theres a gloomstalker at any given point in time within a hundred feet of you  theyre all keeping a net of movement around  taliesin im going to walk up to grog and pike  matt you hear rocks beginning to emerge  taliesin i grab grog and pike were going to run together i activate my silence spell you two are  in my silence spell  travis ive got pike in my hand  marisha and you still have pass without a trace  laura /none/ still pass without a trace  matt no because when you cast locate object that stopped  laura i recast it its okay i recast it  matt okay mark that off so as you guys all emerge topside rushing this 20 feet distance i  need you all to make stealth checks grog you make it with advantage youre still visible  marisha that doesnt take up one of your locate object spells does it then let me cast it im  casting pass without a trace not her  matt using what spell level  marisha 2nd  /none/ matt sorry i misheard i thought you only had a 9thlevel spell slot left  marisha no im talking about my big mack daddies in order to still cast other things  travis i had to roll for both of us  taliesin but you have advantage  ashley you had to roll for both of us  travis but i had advantage i think were okay  marisha for everyone paying attention i have three 1stlevel spells left no 2ndlevel spells  two 3rd one 4th and then an 8th and a 9th and thats it  sam you /none/ have advantage on this  taliesin do i have advantage well i might have advantage also im in the silence spell also not  that i need it though  travis that advantage saved that whole thing from going titsup because that first roll was  explosion  sam 25  taliesin natural 19 so 29  marisha 18 plus nine plus another ten 38  liam 37  laura 46  travis 24  wait dont highfive shit yet why are you highfiving what the fuck whats wrong with  you people jesus  sam what did pike get /dung/  matt pike was being carried his roll was dependent on both of them so as you guys dart  through the open light the first time youve seen light since arriving in this titan the sky  outside is super dark most of the light here is actually emanating from the barrier its creating  its own false twilight sense over this entire city as you rush into the room you all dart into  the nearby doorway theres a halfajar door thats broken and you push through being careful  not to slam into it or to break /town/ it and cause any noise but you all rush into this chamber  immediately the smell wafts of old decay and glancing around you can see longdried bits of  flesh or nondescript innards that have long withered and turned to partial dust  you all come into the shadow of the chamber and take a minute to breathe you hear the distant  sound screeching flapping crunch you hear one perch on one of the buildings about one block down  screeching flapping and continue off it does not appear that you are currently being stalked or  noticed /none/  taliesin they cant hear you  sam it is visible so is there a closet in here or some sort of alcove  matt if i recall correctly the entrance is only visible to people that you signify  taliesin people who see invisible things can see it  sam the entrance shimmers faintly and is five feet wide and ten feet tall you and any creature  you designate can enter  matt okay it is visible but only creatures you designate can enter thats the difference so it  is a faint shimmer  laura we have /none/ to hide it yeah  matt make an investigation check  laura can i help him find a place that would be hidden  sam investigation i got a 23 22  matt okay you go to help him most of the furniture in here is destroyed and withered you  go upstairs and there is a doubledoor cabinet a cupboard  liam the lion the witch and the wardrobe  marisha i thought the same thing  sam harry potter lives there i started reading harry potter  laura oh im so glad  travis started  sam yeah /none/ im on chapter three  liam greetings time traveler  matt i cant wait to take you to universal  laura its going to be so great  matt all right so you cast the mansion in the cupboard the shimmering purple hue the familiar  vision of the door of scanlans magnificent mansion arrives whos going and whos staying  pike grog percy and scanlan staying the three of you going  travis i hold out my hand to vax and i say good luck i hold out my hand to vex and i say take  care of /none/ him  taliesin just in case is it wise to leave one of the gate stones outside the door you take one so  if you need to port back to it its here  laura and liam thats a good call  marisha does someone have to be holding it  taliesin nope  laura put it in a cupboard  taliesin im going to leave it in the kitchen  matt to transfer to a gate stone no you have to activate it and hold it on one side but it brings  you to wherever the gate /none/ stone is  taliesin so im going to put one of the gate stones in a corner so its not so obvious yep  and then you guys have the other one  marisha i have the other one yeah  liam you can get back on your own pretty easily yeah tunneling through stone do you have that  left or thats done  marisha no if im an earth elemental i can earthglide i do still have that  liam i feel like maybe vex should carry the stone then she has less of a chance of getting /none/  back on her own  marisha yeah hopefully were together though but yeah i toss vex the gate stone  matt okay you pocket it you sense you maybe have three more minutes on your spell by the way vex  laura all right its that direction  taliesin all right were in the mansion  matt okay the rest of you head into the mansion quietly  sam if we drink wine tonight it will only be in remembrance of you or to get snookered  laura if we dont come back save vasselheim on your own and /none/ the entire world  liam singing empty chairs at empty tables  marisha team stealth is stealthing as far as we can yeah  liam and laura yeah  marisha oh my god team halfelf yeah this is me saying this not keyleth  matt okay good to know so as you all vanish in the mansion you are outside of the need to  utilize the radial portion of the ring the three of you with the spell quickly waning you begin to  make your way outdoors i need another stealth check from you three  laura another /none/ one  ashley i love you guys please come back  marisha all right dont fuck me opal die that opal die fucked me wait do i have advantage no  laura you have plus ten  travis laughing right out of the gate  matt what did you get  liam does my luck transfer to anybody no  marisha can i do anything else okay lets go and i run into a door  matt so as you guys rush outward into the open way you begin to head across the thoroughfare  following vex whos currently leading /none/ the charge and you can sense it down below at this point  based on the trajectory of it make an intelligence check  marisha they covered for me right  laura intelligence  matt yeah roll plus your intelligence modifier  laura 12  matt 12 okay youre not sure of the distance based on the angle but you know its getting  closer so you guys begin darting from building to building keyleth is straggling a bit behind and  ends up stubbing her toe and instinctually lets out a yelp sound at which point you hear a /none/  distant shriek  marisha shrieking noise  travis wow make it worse thats a one  laura go underground  marisha earth elemental  laughter  matt okay thankfully because there is an old ancient cobblestone walkway here with loose stone  but portions of it have been destroyed and broken and you can find loose earth easy enough and you  can dart in you scrooge mcduck dive into the stone  as you guys dart off to the side and you watch as two gloomstalkers land where she was screeching  and begin to scan over and /none/ look through and theyre walking forward on their large hefty  muscular hind legs walking past where you guys are hiding off to the side they stop and then  turn around and one of them scans past and you both barely duck out of the way  they both take off one after the other  liam fuck a duck  marisha goddamn it  sam does that burn your spell are you done  marisha no im beast shaped im my earth elemental right now okay so i have tremorsense  right i sense the twins  laura /none/ im going to cast locate object one more time oh that that takes me out of stealth  doesnt it  marisha no oh but i have pass without a trace which is still going  liam do you vaguely remember the direction it was in so maybe we go vague for a minute  marisha so i pop my head out jawsing  laura and i point in the direction and have her keep following it  marisha and im going to be like im going to follow their footsteps with my tremorsense  matt and as such you /none/ dont have to make a stealth check youre down below and you follow  their footsteps underneath you guys continue on your current stealth run you get forward about  another 150 or so feet do you want to keep going or do you want to cast  laura is there an abandonedlooking building or anything i can duck into  matt theres a handful most of the city has been long abandoned  laura okay then im going to duck under something so i can cast the spell and then  restealth before i come back out so i /town/ dont bamf in the middle  matt right okay so you duck into a small alleyway you guys are keeping out of view and  waiting for the swarms of undead in the street and as you come around the corner you immediately  see about 12 or 13 zombies clattering past as youre waiting for them to pass by eventually  they get quieter and quieter you take a minute and you cast the spell locate object and its a  much steeper angle now youre getting much closer to it so do you want to keep going  /none/ laura yes i want to restealth and move until im directly over it  matt roll another stealth check both of you actually because weve gone partway through not  that i have to worry about vax  laura 33  matt yeah because you still have pass without a trace from underneath  liam 40  matt okay the two of you making your way through ducking between streets and passages  eventually you get to a point where you sense and almost  laura did she just yawn  travis no she just breathed  marisha she stress /none/ exhaled  ashley my hand and it made a farting noise sorry  matt youre fine you get about another 85 100 or so feet and its nearly directly below you  youre about halfway between the edge of the wall and where entropis the tower is  laura okay im going to tap my foot on the ground and point directly down to you keyleth  marisha directly down doing this as i go  matt okay so you swim down  marisha yeah swimming down  matt okay and youre feeling through earth make an investigation check  /none/ marisha not my strongest suit  matt with disadvantage because you are currently blind in the earth  marisha no im awesome  matt you can glide through it but you cant see through the earth  marisha im an earth elemental  matt give it a shot  travis come on you got this lets go  liam just roll high  travis just drop it out your hand and watch as  all yeah okay  marisha do i count the ones out can i roll it again on the inside  matt thats not how it works /none/  travis is it cocked it looks cocked  matt what did you roll  marisha are we sure with disadvantage five  matt five okay you swim around for about a minute or so and youre finding nothing  marisha yeah im wise im not smart theres a difference  matt so yeah youre swimming around in there youre not finding anything  laura oh does she still have the earring on any luck  liam she cant talk  marisha actually i can we recently ruled because its mental yeah oh wait no  laura you dont know /none/ where it is  marisha no i cant find it  laura can i give her an idea of how deep down it feels how far away it is  matt you dont know the distance just direction you failed your intelligence check so youre not  quite able to consider the changing angle for distance  marisha but maybe that etherealness thing and now i can literally come up and drag you down  laura would i be able to see the sword though if i was on another plane  matt make an intelligence check  liam i /none/ think so yeah you just cant interact  laura do i get your thing of plus two because im standing next to you  liam its for saves not checks  laura 13  matt okay you dont know much about how etherealness works or what the effects are you  dont know if it will help or hinder youre not entirely certain what the effects will do  laura great  marisha but you still have locate object and then you rub some on you so you can still maybe  sense it  laura and i would know /dung/ when its right on me because i can sense that much at least  marisha maybe  liam and you can still see everything yeah you just cant interact with anything  laura put that shit on me then  liam okay so i start slathering her up  matt okay as the oil slathers around you your vision of the world becomes dark gray and  colorless its very similar to when frodo puts the ring on theres a flickering sense and the  world itself seems to be immersed in shadow and not quite there you watch as /none/ all the skeletons  that are swarming through the streets and your brother all become translucent and almost not  there like these ghostly visions of them  laura i dont know is it like sauron is he going to be able to see me  taliesin hush ignore him  laura okay can i sink into the ground  matt the grounds hard  marisha what  liam wait  laura marisha and taliesin wait  laura the ground is hard  liam no weve forgotten about the 60 fucking feet again  laura shes not 60 feet away /none/  matt you ignore objects and effects that arent on the ethereal plane  liam if you take the ring further than 60 feet away from me were blown  marisha but it might not be 60 feet away  laura ill stay 60 feet within the surface of the earth  marisha do we still have another one of those potions you can come with us  matt actually no this is a point of order here ignores all objects and effects that arent on the  ethereal plane this is complicated  marisha this is one of those /none/ stupid dnd now we have to interpret what they mean  travis its a dm call on him i think or how he wants to translate it  matt so heres the thing heres technically what happens as the oil begins to be pressed along  your body you begin to look around and notice as your vision goes gray and everything begins to  fade everything begins to fade as in on the ethereal plane thar amphala this interpretation  of this space is not at this location  laura so i would disappear i would fall  matt /none/ lets see here this is getting really wonky  laura can i cancel it once it starts getting on me and im like this does not seem right  taliesin shit might get really weird now  laura i might just be gone  matt allowing you to move through objects you perceive no thats true its not there on the  ethereal plane its only on this plane im sorry this got really confusing welcome to dnd  thar amphala there is no version of it on the ethereal plane however which means that  currently you can pass /none/ through the ground  laura i can  matt yes my apologies  laura im on another plane of existence though  matt the ethereal plane overlaps this one it layers it in a similar way that the shadowfell does  taliesin you are actually perceivable but only to the things that can perceive  liam but the proof is in the pudding because if that ring were gone from my presence vecna would  be bending me over a barrel right now  matt which  liam hes doing  matt as you dissipate in the ethereal plane  /town/ sam poor ashley  ashley this is so stressful  marisha wait though come on  laura i didnt think about the fact that it works in a different fucking plane  travis that makes sense  matt so as you vanish into the space a little whisper curls into your ear vaxildan ah there  you are ive been looking all over for you and your friends welcome and thats it  liam everybody back to chicken town chicken town and i click the boots of haste and i start  booking back  sam youre abandoning your sister /none/  laura no its okay ive got the thing  marisha its me and you now we got this were good go  liam youre staying  marisha im getting the fucking sword  liam im hearing this over the earring i just heard that i heard it vecna whispered to me and  i said that to everybody through the earring she shouted back at me  matt but they dont hear you because theyre not in the same plane with the earrings  liam does she still hear me  matt no she doesnt  liam but i /none/ heard that so youre not going to go  marisha im getting this sword im here now under the fucking ground  liam i cant talk to you anymore  laura im just floating downwards  marisha i reach up can i grab your shin  liam i realize keyleths not going anywhere and i plunk down  marisha hang on wait can i hear you can i see you nothing with her  travis liam and matt no  marisha why did we do this then  travis i dont know keep going keep doing it  taliesin because /none/ its late and this is whats happening  sam back in the mansion were all sipping wine and im saying i know our friends will come back  to us and i know that they wont ever lead anyone here  matt okay make another check  laura can i float or am i stuck on the surface of the ground  matt lets see here you can move up or down  laura okay im going to go down towards where the sword is  matt you glide through the ground  marisha is that 12 okay all right /none/ thats actually not too bad 14  matt okay was that with disadvantage  marisha seven  matt okay youre still floundering around you have vax dart off and vex has vanished  liam if she screamed i stopped once i realized she wasnt leaving i stayed  matt okay so are you darting back  liam and nobody replied and i stopped because i doubted it and im waiting  matt okay are you going to stealth  liam yeah of course but vecnas whispering in my ear 33 and pass without a trace so 43  marisha go /none/ you should go i come over the ear piece and i say vax you should really go because  you could compromise all of us by staying here you should go  travis shes currently in ethereal form drifting down we should see what happens with that  matt your movement speed at double movement would be 60 with the double dash youre moving 30  feet per round because when youre moving through the ethereal plane through solid objects and  matter it does slow you to half speed  laura can i sense keyleth at all i cant /none/ see her right  matt you cant see her you cant sense her but you do sense the sword you sense the direction  still because locate object is still in effect and youre drifting down down down about a  hundred feet 150 feet and then as you head down to that point you suddenly emerge and you can see  a small cavern maybe ten feet in diameter looks like theres a bit of rubble looks like there may  have been a path that led to here that long crumbled and was either intentionally collapsed or  /none/ naturally collapsed by the movement of the titan and as you come into this tenfoot little cavern  space half of the floor is coated in this brackish green fluid and the other half is solid rock  laura okay i keep going towards the sword  matt okay it then takes you at a slight angle down into the liquid and now you can see the  tunnel continues downward theres a small basin that changes shape as you go down into this murky  greenish fluid down where theres no light it is normally pitch black here but /none/ the etherealness  allows you to take a little bit of the space in looking around you can see that there is a thick  residue that is gathered along the edges and there at the bottom you can sense though you  cannot see it because it is actually a few inches beneath the muck you assume the sword  laura i cant touch it  matt correct  laura but i know where it is can i come up into the cavern and you said there was rock  outcropping that i can stand on can i get /none/ this shit off of me the oil off of me or am i stuck  as an ethereal form  matt this is going to be an interesting question  travis its like lsd isnt it itll take eight hours to go away  laughter  matt how long does it last on the oil  liam i lost the paper but ill look it up  matt i feel like it lasts for an hour let me double check  liam yeah i think thats what it is  laura it lasts  liam one hour  sam shit /none/ laughs  liam weve got to bail on it and come back for it later if at all  laura no not necessarily  matt lets see  laura i have the stone  liam its ethereal  taliesin thats cool  laura this could work  marisha it could still work  laura you guys are in the mansion  marisha were cool  laura yeah were good i dont know if theres anything wrong so you keep tunneling down and  ill wait  matt all right make another check  marisha investigation  matt yep  laura /none/ come on  marisha at disadvantage  matt yep  marisha oh thats better 13  matt 13 okay you begin to eventually find a tunnel that appears to be completely packed with  collapsed loose rock and earth its been long collapsed  marisha its heading downwards  matt seems to be at an angle yeah  marisha all right ill keep being like this seems like a path of least resistance ill glide  through that for a bit  matt takes you a little bit eventually your spell dissipates  laura its been an hour  matt /none/ well no the spell lasts for up to ten minutes  laura oh the locate object right  matt vax what have you been doing  liam im paralyzed i dont know what to do so im hiding not doing anything but how far away  have we traveled from the building we started at with the mansion in it  matt how far have you traveled from the building youre about 120 feet maybe  liam thats fine  matt as youre waiting there paralyzed the voice creeps in once again but where are all your  friends why /dung/ are you alone  liam i dont say shit  matt chuckles you eventually break through the edge and come into the same small cavern that she  encountered and you can see the dark green fluid there  laura keyleth  marisha vex  laura keyleth im right here keyleth  marisha vex  laura keyleth over here im over here  marisha vex  laura yes  marisha vex  laura yeah  matt nothing  laura laughing how long has it been  marisha can you throw a rock or something  laura i cant do shit /none/ i cant interact with anything im just fucking standing here 15  minutes this is the best  marisha its been 15 minutes  matt since she took the oil yeah  taliesin so you found a cavern  marisha i found a cavern  laura i described where it was to you so i described that it was murky water muck is what i  described to you its surrounded by silt is what it felt like  matt okay so what do you do keyleth  sam we need whoopi goldberg  taliesin dont we always  sam /none/ molly you in danger girl  laura keyleth its right here its right here it might be poisonous water im not sure what it  is can you hear me its right here  marisha im going to try to investigate this cavern i guess as much as i can am i still at  disadvantage now that im in a cavern thats cool thats better god fucking hell  taliesin thats a terrible roll im so sorry  marisha nine  matt it looks like a cavern filled partially with fluid  marisha i come over and i say /none/ vax where is your sister  liam she is on another plane shes in the ethereal plane we did the oil thing we didnt  think it through  marisha what do you mean we didnt think it through  liam vecnas whispering in my ear by the way where is he  matt still on entropis  liam still in his spot  marisha so shes not with you  liam no she slipped down into the ground shes probably near you somewhere  marisha what vex  liam we lubed her up in ethereal oil and she went /none/ down your direction  laura vecna can probably hear him  matt vax you begin to hear loud wings flapping louder and louder outside and above a different  sound than the wings of a gloomstalker  liam keyleth you know where to go i have to run and i click the boots of haste and i start  bolting towards the mansion  marisha im not going to leave without your sister bye  matt so are you moving stealthily or are you bolting  liam im going to stealth  sam and heres cucumber salad everyone  travis /none/ why is it always green  taliesin is it considered a salad if its mostly cucumber in there  sam theres some dill  taliesin how is this different than a sliced pickle  marisha i really like dill  taliesin youre in a cavern you cant have any dill  marisha im speaking as myself right now marisha really likes dill  taliesin what does keyleth think of dill we dont know do we well never know  matt all right vax  liam sorry im freaked out 35 am i still pass without a traced at this point /none/ 35  travis hes an astronaut without a ship  taliesin god fucking damn it  matt okay as youre stealthing moving along you can glance over or keep focusing forward  liam no im going to keep going  matt all right you keep going you move move you can hear the wings you can hear this horrible  raspy sounds like a whetstone being slid across steel slowed down with bass its this croaks  liam as im probably getting farther away i say kiki stay underground please and keep going  matt okay eventually you find your /none/ way back to the household seemingly not directly followed  but you hear the wings are circling more localized to where this house is keyleth what  are you doing  marisha im in a cavern alone  matt yeah  sam thats my turn   laughter  marisha vex vex give me a sign vex throw a pebble if you can hear me throw a pebble  laura i sit down on the ground indianstyle  marisha okay im also working this out as me and keyleth vax told me stay underground made a bad  call sisters /none/ underground near me i know where to go he thinks i know where to go i go over to  the muck the greenish liquid and throw a rock in what happens  matt its a little syrupy but it definitely splashes  marisha does it look like acid does it look like what were used to with acid  matt it looks brown green sludgy it doesnt look like the typical acid youve encountered but  it looks like a liquid  marisha i just dip in my toe in the cold water just dip my toe in  /none/ matt you take two points of acid damage it is a caustic liquid  marisha its acid  laura its acid  marisha its acid no one can hear me but im confirming its acid  laura i can hear you it is definitely acid  marisha i feel so alone  liam ive stepped in the door by the way of the mansion  marisha two points of acid damage  sam hows it going outside  liam not well not very well its fucked he knows were here he doesnt know where you are or  where i /none/ am right now but he knows that were here  sam he knows where you are  liam no not anymore  sam did he know where you were  liam he did  sam and did he know that you came over here  liam probably  sam so he knows where we are so we have to leave now  taliesin well were at least relatively safe here for a moment until they figure out a way to  find us and then get rid of us  sam yep but then we have to leave or be /none/ ready to leave at a moments notice or we should maybe  leave right now  liam no we wait a little bit i think that they can get back  sam and then what then we all have to leave  marisha i go deeper  matt okay so you dive into the liquid  marisha not into the liquid just through the stone going deeper  matt okay you coast along the outside and you can sense that youre traveling on the outskirts  of this descending tunnel where the acidic liquid is encased and eventually it rounds /none/ out  marisha i do another sword check  matt make an investigation check  marisha am i at disadvantage again  matt no because you know what youre looking for  marisha thats good dont fuck me gil 16  matt okay you reach out and you grab forth and you feel a few things that you grab and as you  sense them you poke your head through which in the process of doing you do suffer six points of  acid damage and your hands find bones and glancing through a little bit into the space you /none/  can see the entire bottom of this basin is bones probably a good four to five feet of stacked  bones this has been used as a means of disposing of unwanted things  marisha disposing people i keep looking i cant leave without a vex  laura im fucking sitting on the ground theres nothing else i can do  marisha eight  matt four points of acid damage and youre finding nothing but rummaging through  taliesin keep rummaging  marisha im desperate i keep going can i go around and deeper can i follow this path /none/ a little bit  matt yeah you can on the bottom of it or another side what do you want to do  marisha im going to try and go under it im going to think if theres a pit of bodies that  have been thrown away that maybe a sword is somewhere buried under this pit of bodies  matt go for it make another investigation check  marisha fucking hell this is so nervewracking six  matt you take ten points of acid damage  travis you could just wait it out  marisha yeah but keyleth /none/  matt make another check if you want to  marisha every few minutes i go vex im constantly vex vex vax vex still looking  under this pit of people 12  matt you suffer eight points of acid damage and you reach through and your hand finally hits something  hard and cold within the silt its stuck in the muck but theres something there that is not like  the rest of the bone it feels metal  marisha okay i try and earth clear  sam earth clear laughs  marisha earth clear clear eyes  /none/ matt make a strength check  sam everclear  taliesin wow its been a long time  marisha this is stressful  marisha oh natural 18 23 wait no 24  matt okay you take seven points of acid damage  marisha seven  matt as you reach out and you grab and you can now glance through and see this is the hilt of a  blade and its stuck in the muck you yank it free you pull it out of the muck and its free  at this point youre surrounded by skeletal bones and you feel /none/ the fingers pulling at you and  tearing and you look around you as a wall of these corpses these broken corpses all begin to  grasp at you  marisha i go up to the cavern im out im bailing with this  matt you cant pull this into the rock with you  travis we discussed this  matt its metal it doesnt come into the rock it doesnt earthglide with you so you have to  glide up with your hand out  marisha okay yeah im beating as i go upwards  matt make another strength /none/ check to see if you can break the grapple of the undead hands that are  now grabbing and trying to hold you there at the bottom of the basin  laura can i see any of this happening  marisha okay 21  matt no 21 you do manage to break free you suffer another five points of acid damage and  begin to earthglide your way up you get about halfway up and suffer another nine points of acid  damage  marisha 84 70 76 okay yeah still going  matt and you eventually emerge from the /none/ top as you suffer another seven points of acid damage and  manage to earthglide you watch as all of a sudden the water separates and bursts and you watch as  her earth elemental form emerges its hand coming up through the water clutching a blackened blade  marisha vex  laura okay shit trinkets still in my necklace i wonder if i bamf him out he wasnt covered in  oil if hed be in the regular plane or if he would be in the ethereal plane  taliesin you may never see your bear nope playing devils /none/ advocate cosmic bear  matt laughing cosmic bear  marisha does he become a constellation after that  taliesin hell look like eternity from marvel comics hell be this star bear  laura would he be an ethereal bear or would be bamf out in the regular plane  liam thats a big risk  marisha how much time has it been  matt its been about 30 minutes  laura i dont know how this shit works im going to bamf trinket out of the necklace  taliesin what  laura i dont know how this fucking shit works /none/ im going to try to bamf trinket out of the  necklace  marisha come on trinket come on keyleth sees trinket keyleth sees trinket  sam best episode ever  marisha come on damn it  matt as the cold sense of worry comes over you you clutch the necklace and theres a flash as you  watch trinkets form burst from the necklace gray and shaded and you see as trinket pops out of  nowhere by the way between the two of you you guys are pretty crammed into here to not be in the  acid /none/ right now youre both like grunts confused bear noises  marisha bear noises wheres vex vex  matt hes sniffing around  laura i was basically trying to let her know where i was  marisha i saw him appear suddenly right okay vex okay i pet trinket for an indeterminate  amount of time i wait  laura can you chill right here because this is where i am can we wait it out  matt you can how long can you hold your form  marisha half my level  matt yeah so youre here for a while /none/ okay so you guys sit and wait carefully thinking  contemplating over the next 30 minutes or so eventually you begin to watch as vexahlias form  begins to emerge once more into this plane  sam shes back  laura this was the stupidest idea weve ever  marisha and laura sobbing in relief  laura trinket get back in the necklace  matt trinket is licking your face intensely  laura youre such a good bear okay  marisha i want to drop my form is this it  laura thats it but heres the thing should you /none/ glide back to the mansion i stone back to the  mansion with the sword okay give me the sword  marisha okay i give her the sword i have the sword is it the sword it is the sword  matt its what you saw yeah  cheering  marisha and laura okay  marisha i know where the mansion is right vaguely  laura you can glide back to the mansion  matt it might take you a little while but you can find your way back  marisha okay go okay ill see you soon  laura /none/ okay good luck and im going to think of the stone i already put trinket back in the  necklace  matt okay you concentrate for a minute as the stones energy fills you you flash and all of a  sudden youre standing over the other stone  marisha and before she leaves i say do a little tap dance so i know on the outside where the  mansion is i know where the mansion is though  matt yeah you know where it is  marisha okay thats fine okay  laura okay all right i pick /none/ up the stones and go in the mansion  matt okay you grab the stones and go in the mansion  marisha i doggiepaddle back  matt as you make your way slowly in that direction you hear a little voice whisper in your  ear its not going to help you  laughter  laura oh he wouldve  matt eventually you slowly make your way to the building and as you emerge from the inside you  can hear the loud flapping of wings nearby jumping from rooftop to rooftop  marisha i go in the mansion as /none/ fast as i can  matt all right you dart into the mansion you guys watch as keyleths elemental form bursts into  the mansion space with the rest of you  liam oh my god  i run forward and hug the big fucking stone giant like a cat  laura this was really stupid we were so dumb this was so dumb  sam is she back do you have the sword  laura i have the sword yeah  marisha i drop form  laura there you go grog  liam we are blown  sam we /none/ have to move the safehouse has been compromised  laura okay so heres the thing he knows were here  liam he cant see us anymore but he knows  laura he knows that you two are here he doesnt know the rest of us are  marisha he knows were in this vicinity i think once we get into the mansion he doesnt know an  exact place so as long as they dont figure out the mansion  sam he doesnt know were in here but he knows where the mansion is and he will come to dispel /none/  it so we have to get out of this mansion and either make another mansion somewhere else or go  to somewhere else from inside this mansion right now  laura we can plane shift  marisha i can plane shift us  laura will you be able to get us back here though  marisha if we rest  sam to this exact spot  laura or to thar amphala  marisha if we leave from a mansion i can teleport us back to a mansion with some pretty  accurate itd be the difference between the spa /none/ or the kitchen but if its gone then its gone  but then i could still bamf us back to thar amphala or whatever other city that we came out of  taliesin worst case scenario we can leave the gate stone outside  matt theres a moment with a faint whining highpitched sound and this sudden thrust theres  a sudden thrust of vacuum as the mansion around you dissipates and youre all plopped onto the  ground outside of the cupboard where across crawled upward partway into the building you see  a skeletal dragon standing there its /none/ claws jammed into the inside its wings open and you see  standing on the back of the dragon finger forward  marisha plane shift  matt i know finger forward finishing the dispel magic she had cast delilah briarwood with behind  her darkened armor arms around sylas grinning as she goes oh glad you could make it  no wait as soon as you gather shes going to attempt to counterspell  laura oh god  ashley no dont do it  laura dont do it  matt chuckles so plane shift is 7thlevel right  marisha no /none/ but i am doing it as an 8thlevel because im out im doing it as an 8thlevel  matt okay good to know so where are you plane shifting to  marisha feywild  matt feywild okay  marisha do we have a city in the feywild that we know of thats safeish  laura go to the pond  matt thats a natural eight  marisha the pond fuck you the pond  matt as she attempts to counter the spell even at a higher level it fizzles unable to break  through and all of you as you /none/ watch her hand extend and sylas about to dismount  travis say it  matt whoosh  yelling  matt you find yourselves pulled out of thar amphala  yelling  taliesin fuck the briarwoods  marisha why did we do this  laura that sword better be the most amazing sword  taliesin were practically gods lets be fair were so fucked  travis oh god jesus  matt you guys all plop down your feet hitting the somewhat wet grassy ground of the swamp where  you you said the pools where you first emerged last time  /none/ laura yeah where the water elemental is  matt yeah where the nymph was you guys all land in these pools looking around you can see the  darkened wood over you the sound of crickets and nearby insects fill the air and for the first  time in a long time though your blood pumping would not tell you a stillness and a peace in the  vicinity around you  taliesin oh god we should turn off our cell phones more often this feels really good oh god  liam really cool  travis immediate perception check around /none/ us  matt make a perception check  travis oh 17  sam music just got supes loud  travis 17  matt all right glance about your vicinity you see nothing that has noticed your presence or  seems to be of interest to you at the moment  travis you all figure out what were doing next and i put the bloodaxe away and i start  concentrating on this giant greatsword  laura are we fucked  marisha did we leave behind a gate stone did someone say we were leaving one  laura no i took /none/ all the gate stones  taliesin we thought about leaving one as a marker for us  laura yeah but it doesnt go through planes  matt as you concentrate on the cold metal of the weapon a different but still familiar sense  creeps in  marisha oh no  matt i get the sense this isnt the first time  sam wait what  travis well you always remember your first  matt i also sense we have a similar goal  travis could you be a little bit more specific  laughter  liam we all see /none/ this right hes not snuck off right im going to come and sit next to him and  watch whats up buddy just keep doing your thing im ten feet away im not breathing down  your neck you all right  travis are you hearing anything aces  laughter  matt the lich must die  travis the witch  matt the lich  travis oh the lich yeah are you talking about vecna  matt yes  laughter  travis then yes we do share similar goals i dont know if you can hear me very well your /none/  voice is barely there  matt oh no so are you inspecting it or are you attuning to it  travis im attuning im locking it in  liam im going to assume i have deduced somewhat what is going on here  matt yeah hes talking to his weapon you have all seen this before and its as disconcerting  now as it was last time  travis hey hi  liam hey man you do you  travis im not even trying to hide it this time  laura you can definitely hear the sword  travis /none/ yeah anybody else  all no  travis what  ashley whats it saying  travis oh it was saying that we have similar goals and that the witch must die the lich is  vecna lich the lich its very emphatic about the lich meaning vecna and its going to die  matt his secrets his followers all of it must topple you will be my instrument  travis apparently im going to be an instrument hes going to play me to topple the followers and  his secrets  ashley what does it want from you in return /none/  travis thats a good question pike whispering what do you require from me in return  matt just wield me spill blood for me bring me to the undying king and cut his throat with my  blade thats all i ask thats all i need  travis he really doesnt ask much just average runofthemill fight stuff be true to thy  friend this one is nothing to worry about  ashley okay  matt its still currently embedded in its scabbard  travis oh reception problems hold on  laura i like that you grab it by /none/ the blade  sam weapons training  travis yeah

/none/ for the purposes of this that the attunement is successful  taliesin that is the most frightening thing  marisha does it have to be though  sam hes getting dice a lot of dice  matt all right  sam a lot of dice  matt you suffer 38 points of psychic damage your vision goes cloudy you guys watch as his skin  color goes from his general stone gray to a more pale white you watch as his physical body becomes  more gaunt the jowls sink in slightly and his eyes turn a little red around /dung/ the iris your  vision goes a bit dark and the sword goes blood i need blood give me blood im so  hungry you find yourself standing up with the blade out in front of you  travis guys i dont feel so great  matt make two attacks against vax  travis thats who i was going to attack  sam vax or vex  matt vax hes the closest one  travis i didnt say reckless would he make them reckless  matt not at the moment no hes not familiar with your capabilities yet  travis /none/ 21  liam yes  matt its a longsword so roll 1d8  travis 1d8 not raging  liam wait ill use my last luck of the day to make him reroll that  travis the damage or to hit  liam to hit  travis its worse 18  liam doesnt hit  matt second strike  travis thats way worse thats a 16  matt you dodge both blows as grog goes and swings at you twice with the longsword  liam i disengage and jump back 15 feet  laura grog what are you doing  taliesin /none/ give him some distance  travis im going to be totally full front here the sword needs blood  liam we can get that for you just not from inside us  travis i feel like its trying to take it from me  matt whos closer to grog right now between the two of you  travis you jumped in front of him  matt two attacks on vex please  laura shouting wait kas is this kas are you kas kas this is counterproductive this is  counterproductive were all going after vecna this is so stupid you /none/ are ruining your chance of  killing vecna by attacking us  matt what was it  travis 27  matt roll 1d8 add your strength modifier  travis ten  matt so you take ten points of slashing damage as the blade arcs across the front of your sister  you see a spray of blood make a second attack  travis that hits  matt roll another d8  travis oh thats only a nine  matt nine damage as she reels back from the first strike the second one cuts across the  shoulder and clavicle area /none/ down the arm as another spray of blood hits you pull back and  watch as the blade is now currently drenched in vexs blood  travis its actually ten because i had to reroll ones and twos  laura youre a fucking dick  matt there you go as the second attack comes to a halt you guys are watching him carve into vex  the blood on the edge of the blade seeps into it and your tunnel vision subsides and you take a  breath

travis yeah  matt you take 1d4 points of damage  travis that was my plan but we could do it right now just to be careful you want to drip some on  the blade and see if he likes the flavor  liam ive already started dripping  matt it seeps into the dark almost pitchblack metal you hear the inhale of the blade as it  takes in the blood and seems to devour it  travis guess he /none/ digs the other white meat  marisha does he ever get full  travis no ive asked that before man you dont want to go that way  laura it went bad before  travis yeah it went all anime  liam goddamn it travis then you and me have an agreement here rather than wait until he comes  knocking in the meantime could i feed him once an hour or so  travis yeah in fact any time i take him out of the scabbard why dont you hang real close i  might have to plunge him /none/ into your thigh or something  liam that seems extreme  travis i dont know how hungry he is  matt just a note this conversation is strange since youre staring at grog and his eyes are  burning a little red the visual change is still that way  laura are you always like that now  travis do i need some eye drops  laura grog you need to eat something you look really gaunt  taliesin lets get him a steak or something  sam you look like a methhead  matt hes still muscular all the /none/ skin is pulled taut against the bone  laura im really glad that

wow way to /none/ bring that back  matt so whats the plan  sam what is the plan were in the feywild where theres werewolves and pixies  taliesin and your father  laura no not anymore  marisha ive been thinking about this just a little the feywild as you know when weve left  before and when we go back sometimes time gets a little wibblywobbly  sam i dont know that i aged but didnt know why  matt thats true you didnt  laura time gets a little wonky here  marisha there were some things going on with /none/ you at the time  taliesin can we pinpoint when we get back  laura is there a way to control it  marisha no  taliesin i was about to say youve been thinking about it and the answer is no  marisha we cant but do you remember our friend garmelieslashartagan  sam he was not our friend he was an asshole  laura no he was great  marisha he was cool  sam wasnt he the guy who sketched us and was creepy  laura yeah he was funny and he also helped us and he /none/ also enjoyed us because we were weird  liam basically it also describes you so i feel like you should be understanding  sam fair point i lost my house today all right  so go easy  laura you can get it later right  sam its insured  laura okay  taliesin we can also maybe have a second to breathe and have a second to maybe identify that  stone we took  sam we took a stone  travis yeah we got this blue crystal  laura maybe artagan can identify it  travis i take /none/ out the blue crystal is it still pulsing  sam wait why are we finding this artagan fellow  marisha well hes an archfey he told us he was an archfey they more or less control this realm  or at least have strong dominance over it he might be able to help us make sure that were  going back in minutes as opposed to years  laura you think he could do that  sam he can control the land the powers of the land  laura i dont know if hes going to be able to control /none/ time though  taliesin its entirely possible that we could return to where we were with only a few minutes  having passed  laura its also possible that well return and years have gone by and vecna is already a god  marisha we have to talk to artagan  taliesin plead our case  marisha i bet he can help us i dont know though  taliesin i dont think its in anybodys interest to have vecna controlling any of the planes  laura oh thats true maybe hell want to help if he can  taliesin yes /none/ perhaps  liam its too much of a risk to go back normally anyway we might as well find him  marisha if he can help us might still be able to take a rest  taliesin sleep and return minutes later  laura gasps im going to cry that would be so wonderful  marisha whimpering i need to sleep so bad im so tired  taliesin you definitely have been sleep cranky  laura stuttering it was a thing im so sorry that vecna found us the ethereal thing was a  backfire  liam a series of /none/ bad decisions  marisha whimpering i felt so alone lets not split the party you guys  taliesin no never again  laura how do we get a hold of  sam garmelie  ashley i could send a message  laura to garmelie  liam how do you mean  ashley well i could use sending  travis oh yeah  ashley yeah and we could write a

us any good  travis its going to put me a lot closer to doing /none/ that  laura to killing vecna  marisha because vecna was all like oh you cant beat me  travis the only weapon that does as much shit as this does the closest thing to it is your staff  your vestige this thing is bonkers  laura let me see it  ashley okay  laura okay what did you draw what did you draw pike  ashley i cant draw and if only one of the amazing artists were here so okay its a penis  laughter  sam and taliesin cum see us  matt and ashley /none/ 4 a good time  taliesin time circled  matt this is vox machina by the way  laughter and applause  laura hes a happy penis oh its so great  marisha it looks like a condomed penis  matt its not too bad as you suddenly hear a voice behind you vex and you turn to look and  artagan is right there behind you  sam he came that fast  marisha dont tell people that artagan  matt ill keep it a secret best i can best i can he stands there before you his yellowishgreen /none/  attire with the high collar and his wild orangish hair framing his face like a lions mane his  pale elfin fey complexion smiles as he puts the hands together well show me a good time  nervous laughter  laura okay  sam i unzip my pants  laughter  matt he doesnt flinch  laura i shimmy  liam give me 12 minutes and ill have  this armor off  taliesin i am legit out of sheer panic going to take off all

manners definitely  liam 11 minutes from now im going to be joining you percival  taliesin im in there yelling into the water right now because its been too much  matt how have you been whats going on  yelling and laughter  laura its been a little crazy actually we were hoping that maybe we could seek your aid please  matt define the request please  laura okay so you /none/ know how time is weird when we go back to the other plane of existence  matt weird time is fun when you go back  laura exactly its so much fun were in dire straits over there the world is about to be taken  over by an asshole that wants to be a god and were trying to kill him and were here now and  were hoping that we can hang out here and rest and go back and only a few seconds have passed  maybe a minute or two  sam is that something you /none/ can control  matt chuckles are you telling me that you would stumble into this space unannounced summon  me here under the pretense of a good time and then request me to bend the very essence of time  passage between my plane and yours  marisha we can show you a good time first  laura we definitely do want to show you a good time about it  liam and what is your idea of a good time unbutton unbutton  travis and we certainly dont expect that to be accomplished without something given in return of /none/  course  matt now were talking i could help  laura you can do that  matt more or less  sam and what would you request  matt well you all dress very differently than the last time we met youre doing well for  yourselves then  liam its been a hard day  laura we have a bakery  matt thats quaint  marisha in comparison to the world events  sam im pretending to be a mage right now so  travis we fought of a bunch of ancient dragons weve established order back in /none/ our realm  liam im unkillable for a while  matt thats fun  liam highpitched well  sam im a crime lord i can get you really good discount furniture  taliesin coming back sopping wet and naked ill say and weve got this weird thing that were not  entirely sure about  laura we found this ball of light crystal  matt tell you what ill help you under two conditions one should you go back and defeat  this wannabe god thing you speak of and all is well and youre heroes and you have all /none/ of this  influence and money and everythings grand we can discuss maybe creating a doorway for me that  allows passage ill come visit and see what strangeness your world seems to have whenever id like  marisha i dont know if youd like it  matt oh im sure i can figure out a way  liam its real dicey at the moment  matt but im sure if you succeed that wont be a problem and if you fail well then i guess the  deals off anyway  travis very true  laura good point  /none/ matt second i wish to strangle you until death  laughter  sam hes into autoerotic asphyxiation  travis laughing amazing oh my god  liam wait grog im sorry come again  matt i wish to put my hands on your throat until you expire if you say youre unkillable well  thats a new experience entirely  liam okay okay okay  laura will you come back have we tested this  travis vex be quiet  liam i have one further request on our end can you send us backward in time  matt im afraid it /none/ doesnt work that way but i could give the mere passage of an hour  sam mere passage of an hour thats good yeah  matt day for an hour i think its a fair trade yes  marisha can you give us a full day in order to make sure that he does come back  matt sure day for an hour 24 hours are yours to do as you like  marisha you would come back in 24 hours right  sam can i ask one question first will you be pleasuring yourself during this  matt he /none/ actually laughs at this and goes i think the process will be enjoyable enough  sam oh i respect you so much  taliesin since were making a deal i want to make sure of a few things because i love making  deals first of all as perhaps a token of friendship do you have any idea what this is i  am still apologetically naked and wet  matt its a pulse stone  all a what  matt a pulse stone  laura and sam what is that  matt its meant to distract undead  sam /none/ how do you activate it  matt it just does  taliesin thank you second question is when we do return in an hour where are we going to  reappear  matt thats up to you im just altering the time flow do you not have a means of returning  you found your way here  sam the place that were meaning to return to is moving could you send us to a moving place  laura its keyleth thats sending us back and she can  sam can you send us back we have to send ourselves /none/ back  matt im concentrating on the passage of time thats a large enough endeavor in itself  marisha i can get us back to thar amphala on the material plane and specify that but it doesnt  specify where were going to land in thar amphala  taliesin this is great  marisha i got a question artagan do you know if  laura is is artagan or artagan  matt take your preference im just happy to have friends  sam garmelie  matt if you must and he winks and for a second you see his form /none/ shimmer and you see the  small satyr image for a moment before it restores to his grand visage  taliesin another strange question have you ever had access to our world before  matt a long time ago  taliesin have i read about this cat  matt make an intelligence check just the intelligence modifier  sam i dont remember being in the feywild at all or meeting him  laura you dont  sam right  matt well it was restored via spell  sam oh thats right but does that restore memories  matt as part /none/ of the actual effect yeah  taliesin nope  matt you have no idea who he is  taliesin nope no idea none nope i have no idea  laura youve had access but you were blocked  matt things rearrange every eon or so and the ley lines that guide the paths shift and i  havent been able to get back since  travis that seems most unfortunate  laura youre not going to become addicted to strangling people because youve tried it on him  matt i dont know i havent tried it  taliesin how long /none/ does he have to be dead in your hands before you decide that its worked  liam can i tell if hes lying  matt sure make a deception check sorry an insight check  liam 18  matt lying about which one  liam never strangled someone before  matt you have no idea hes slippery hes mercurial  taliesin this is the problem with fey they dont tend to lie they tend to tell just most of the truth  liam all right with a couple of provisions here all right one you cannot say shit while youre /none/  doing this  laura hes not allowed to talk  liam that is correct  matt fair enough i think it would spoil the moment anyway  liam two and this includes the rest of you lot everybody leaves except for scanlan and grog and  they stay  marisha what  taliesin no im all right with that  laura i dont want to see it  travis i think thats a fair request  sam can i pleasure myself  taliesin i whap scanlan on the head  liam i dont know how to feel about this /none/  laura let him do it youll come back right  liam oh vax is okay that was liam just now  laughter  marisha this is so weird okay wait keyleth pulls vax aside  laura gross stop  travis its like a dog you got to pull him off your calf  marisha are you sure about this are you okay with this  liam ill see you soon  marisha we can ask if he wants something else  liam ask him i dont think he does  marisha and youll be back yeah  liam probably /none/  marisha in 24 hours or so  liam ill be back  ashley wait but how

liam percy  ashley im not going to stay if he doesnt want me to stay  liam take keyleth out of here please  taliesin absolutely  marisha wait no wait i try /none/ to give him a kiss before we leave before getting dragged out  travis vax i want you to know ive never been more proud of you than i am right now  liam i want you to laugh your fucking ass off all right  travis i might im just saying youre about to buy the ticket and take the ride of a literal  fucking lifetime  marisha this is fucking weird  travis youre not here anymore  marisha im saying as myself this is fucking weird  sam this is weird this is like a weird /none/ snuff film  matt i dont know where this came from  travis how do you feel are you nervous  marisha what  liam you keep an eye have him drag me somewhere safe and keep an eye on me  sam sure  travis can i put my hand on his chest is the heart still beating  matt yeah slow  travis is it beating any faster because hes nervous  matt a hint  travis still pretty chill  taliesin do you still have advantage on death saving throws because of that thing that we did /none/ a  while back or is that long gone never mind carry on  travis do you want us to hold anything do you want to wear your clothes  liam lets stop talking folks could you look after keyleth please  laura of course darling  liam see you tomorrow  laura see you in a bit  ashley dont you do anything else you just strangle him until he dies and then you leave him  alone  laughter  matt i wouldnt dream of trying little one dont worry  taliesin well this may be the weirdest /none/ thing this is not the worst thing  laura artagan this is weird as fuck  matt welcome to my world  laura all right i slowly walk away  matt okay pike have you left as well  ashley yes im going to honor your wishes vax im going to go swim  laura yeah im going to swim  taliesin everyones backing off  laura were swimming naked while my brother is dying no big  marisha oh my god  liam hey grog all he gets to is strangle me to death thats it  travis all /none/ right what about after youre dead  liam no  travis no touch at all no pickle  liam neither artagan or scanlan are able to do anything to me once im out  travis oh oh okay yeah right  liam and then make sure he doesnt lose me in the woods or something okay  sam youll be fine this will be harrowing for you but youll be fine well bring you back  liam its been so much fun until now  sam this is a sacrifice  travis yeah everything in your life has been leading /dung/ up to this point this is the pinnacle  this is great  liam dont speak  travis fair enough  liam i walk up to artagan all right fucknut lets do this  matt you believe this you really believe youre going to come back if you die  liam clicks tongue  matt fair play to the immortals and he takes your throat and begins to squeeze his eyes locked  in and he keeps watching you  laura and marisha this is so dark  travis i step up behind vax in case he has an involuntary /dung/ reaction to reach up to his arms just  to keep his arms down  matt he locks in  liam no fear remember  matt yeah without making any other noise continues to apply pressure eventually your  vision begins to go dark  laura im so glad we cant see this  taliesin yeah no underwater  marisha id be freaking out  sam i look away  travis i dont  ashley im peeking out of the pond  taliesin i grab her and drag her right back to the pond  matt this is so weird /dung/  travis this is your head man  matt i know  liam you could have asked for a magic wand or a unicorn a pony  matt it was a fascination with something different and new and you said cannot die and  that immediately piqued his interest even the nicest of fey are weird and have their dark  sides  liam preach david bowie  matt yeah you watch over the next minute or so as he strangles the life out of vax  laura oh my god  travis are you hungry right now  laughter /none/  matt this is so fucked up  taliesin this is quality internet  matt i know limp in his grasp garmelie eventually pulls one hand back still holds him  now his feet are dangling and goes like satisfying but not what i thought it would be  at which point you watch as the body and flesh of vax begins to burn to ashes out of the armor and  the armor falls to the ground in pieces  travis oh god okay  marisha well last time he got disintegrated so we didnt really see him evaporate /none/ but that makes  sense  travis im going to look at scanlan were you expecting this at all  sam no not at all what the fuck is this  travis im going to grab the armor if you dont mind  matt of course its yours  travis oh thank you  sam ill scoop up everything  travis lets go away from the group into the trees hopefully that wont kill us and we lay  it down  sam ill make a little circle of rocks  marisha oh stop it i kick the rocks out /none/ of formation  travis youre not there  marisha oh i thought he dragged it outside  taliesin theyre in the woods were in the pond  travis i wanted to shave half of his head because he shaved my beard that one time but theres  really nothing left of him right now  sam i dont think that that would be a good time to do this  matt as you guys are swimming the water breaks and you see the still dry hair as it emerges from  the pool of garmelie though he is now undressed /none/ in the water as well ah so thats one deal  done where do you wish to rest  laura oh is it safe to rest  matt while im here yes  laura okay whimpers should we wait we need to wait 24 hours to bring him back it takes 24 hours  liam nobody knows that  sam i dont know that  marisha somewhere in that time how long did it take last time it wasnt a full 24 hours but it  was the next day  laura it was that night  marisha i dont /none/ want to leave  taliesin might be a dawn thing we moved and he appeared  travis thats the thing about dawn it takes a while out here doesnt it  taliesin dawn doesnt really exist out here its just a rest  liam its like a vegas casino its always the same twilight  laura all right well okay  taliesin is there somewhere else that we could go to recuperate  travis wasnt expecting the ashes part  laura yeah this is crazy  travis i expected the crash test dummy weekend at bernies i had a whole /none/ fucking theme park  lined up  laughter  ashley is it bad if we set up camp right here  laura yeah lets set up camp here we know this area  matt of course please and he points over and you look back to where you were on the edge of the  pool and you can see theres a bunch of stumps that werent there before that seem to have  elongated into chairs and couches and bits of furniture  laura oh shit nice  matt thank you  laura sighs  sam are we going /none/ to rest here  laura yeah but we need to do a feast before we go back well the thing is it uses a spell so  it has to be within the 24 hours  taliesin that will be the last thing we do before we go to sleep  laura okay but i want vax to have the feast as well so  marisha can we save him leftovers  sam do we have to wait a whole day before he comes back  travis we dont know  laura we dont know how long it takes we /none/ can try to wait and see how long it takes and then rest  marisha maybe  taliesin we have a little time  laura lets give it some time  marisha besides garmelie gave us his word  taliesin one day  matt one day  marisha so we might as well wait a few hours at least right  sam anything else we can accomplish here  matt we can play  laura this feels weird to play  matt oh do about yourselves you seem disturbed by my presence  travis i do have a question  /none/ matt yes  travis are you familiar with the werewolves that roam these lands  matt i am familiar with the werewolves that now roam these lands yes  travis right are they around this part  matt no not at the moment  laura you can sense them  matt i have an idea where they might be i know when theyre not near me  travis thats all im just saying just curious  laura hey artagan does killing a wannabe god sound fun to you  matt sounds interesting  laura it would be much more fulfilling /none/ than strangling a person that didnt fight back right  matt i dont know  laura would you want to come through with us  marisha give a little tour of our land that you so desperately want access to  taliesin theres currently a giant city walking its way towards another giant city  travis some sweet action with some stuff maybe you havent seen before  taliesin a skeletonized dragon a gold dragon  marisha undead dwarves  taliesin cannibal undead dwarves  travis oneeyed prick named vecna  matt i mean thatd be great but i cant /none/  laura oh you have to have a specific doorway  matt once you have the door id be happy to join you  laura okay and thats a timeconsuming sort of thing  matt depends how long you can build a doorway i suppose  marisha sounds like a timeconsuming thing  matt most likely no offense to any of you if youre carpenters  taliesin no weve had an enormous amount of trouble with doors in our time  laughter  taliesin very tricky  matt well take your time rest food is prepared you can go amongst /none/ yourselves ill be  here splashing away and he splashes into the water  travis that guy knows how to relax  marisha is that how he lives all the time  travis think so yeah probably nude probably put clothes on to be nice around us  laura sylas

theres got to be something we can do  sam i need to accomplish something  laura what do you need to do  sam i dont know i have a spell and i can use it before we rest but i dont know what to use it on  laura what is it  sam well i can do a few different things before we sleep we can go out into the woods and find an  animal a big animal i could turn it into something like a flying thing that /none/ we could give  to grog so he could fly fly with that sword  laura like a mount sort of situation  sam like a wyvern  laura you can turn an animal into a wyvern  sam sure  laura any animal  sam a big animal  laura bigger than trinket  sam i would love to turn trinket into a wyvern  laughter  laura is it permanent  sam yes  laura oh never mind then  travis is it a big spell for you  sam yeah  laura trinket would you want to /none/ be turned into a wyvern  sam forever  matt questioning bear noise  laura hold on let me see if ive got speak with animals i dont think i have it its 1stlevel  i can

just checking i  just wanted to make sure its your choice darling  sam did he say yes  /none/ laura no he said no  sam i knew that i can speak with animals too  laughter  laura you havent been saying shitty things to my bear have you  sam all year  laughter  laura trinket dont ever listen to him hes horrible  matt spits  laughter  sam or  travis or  sam or i could do other things  laura like what  sam i could do other things i could make another compatriot for us to have in battle  laura like another artagan  sam like another scanlan or another /none/ pike  laura would they be fully capable to cast all your spells  sam yes  laura oh shit  liam spells  sam or i could do other things  travis actually that last one is pretty dope  liam yeah two scanlans  travis get all your turns all your everything two times whoever you make  sam i dont know never done this before  laura oh my god what kind of spell is this  sam its a crazy spell  travis do that one fuck the flying thing  sam but if you could /none/ fly  travis yeah i know he hovers and flies but  sam yeah you could bring that sword to his neck  liam could you give grog wings  sam its a real thing magic would not stop it from flying it would be a real thing  laura a real thing that could be killed right out from under him though  sam sure but it couldnt be dispelled with magic  taliesin could be disintegrated though  laura and then grog would fall  liam right  travis can you cast fly on somebody  sam no /none/ i can turn you into an eagle  laura not with that sword  travis no the option of having a second caster like you is way bigger than making me fly  sam another scanlan who could easily be destroyed  laura well but so could one of us  sam well itll be a magic thing that could be dispelled  travis if they know its magic  marisha but you just said the other thing couldnt be destroyed  sam that thing couldnt that would be a different spell altogether  travis i still like that idea /none/ better  sam theres other things too  laura like what  laughter  sam i could cast a spell on one of us that if you died it would activate and it would heal you  laura completely  sam no  laura oh death ward pike can cast that  marisha whatever you do i can get me plus eight other people through with plane shift eight  willing creatures  sam but my death ward would last for ten days  taliesin there are not going to be ten days we dont need a tenday death ward /none/ we need a oneday  death ward  laura plus we all have our blessings not all of us we have some blessings from gods that will  activate hopefully right before  marisha can you do a oneday blessing on ten of us  travis can you cast haste  sam no i mean i could but it seems like a shitty use  travis if theres two of you and you could cast haste on me
