none	 was doing it wrong this whole time yep  matt oh boy anyway last we left off vox machina had discovered the existence of a second  zigguratlike structure on the continent of marquet and apparently a cult of the whispered  one there gathering magical artifacts to toss into a second darkened black orb similar to the one  beneath whitestone all this time you ran into scanlan once more and leading you guys to where  this cavern was found in the mountains of smouldercrown on the continent of marquet you did  battle with the cultists there 
dung	 and seemed to reveal one of the leaders in that group was none  other than the notdead delilah briarwood she fended you off completed their ritual and some  of their surviving cultists fled into the orb apparently to the other side you then gathered  yourselves gathered some supplies your information and then proceeded to travel through  the orb in whitestone into the shadowfell the shadow plane dark mirror to the prime material  where you stumbled upon a partially ruined city that had undergone some sort of ancient siege and  much of it still lies 
town	 in ruins and disrepair where you discovered what seemed to be two other  siphon orbs existing around the outskirts of this forgotten city leaving threads of magical energy  being siphoned and transferred to a singular black obsidian tower for whatever purpose the whispered  one the undying king has for this energy you began to make your way deeper into the city  masquerading as some undead in the process you killed a few cultists wandering the street and  intimidated one or i should say you didnt intimidate you killed him and then asked his  corpse 
none	 i guess thats a form of intimidation probably one of the most extreme forms of  intimidation really discovering that this city is under the title thar amphala thar amphala you  dont know too much about it other than it seems to be where an ancient battle took place much of  the undead that wanders this realm carries armaments weapons and symbols that seem to be of  pelor the dawn father you also discovered that theres this tower in the center titled entropis  where all the magic is being funneled at the moment thus having found 
none	 this information  gathered your resolve you continue your trek deeper and deeper into the city surrounding the  tower entropis to discover what your purpose is here in thar amphala  so vox machina what do you do  liam figuring it all out  sam taking five  laura time out time out time out  ashley just hanging out  sam so we found out that theres a ritual happening soon  laura yeah like super stat  sam and theres no day or night here so who cares right  laura right its all just night 
dung	 all the time  matt its kind of a sunless gray sky theres some low light like a very heavy like a very  dark thunderous seattle  ashley singing hello seattle its a song  travis what song  ashley i think it is  matt it is now so  sam we have to make our way to the big tower right super fast and invisibly  oh were also vampire creatures  laura oh we look like the gloom stalkers no those are the flying ones  sam we look like miscellaneous vampirey things right  liam 
none	 yeah shambling zombies  laura scary ghouly creatures  taliesin extras from a bad zombie video  travis is pass without a trace still kicking  sam what  travis pass without a trace  matt i would say probably because you havent cast a spell yet that  wouldve interrupted it it would be  laura i cast it when we landed here  matt but i dont think youve done anything that altered that concentration yet  laura i dont think so so its still going  matt i think so for maybe another 30 minutes or so 
none	  laura yeah i didnt hunters mark either of the guys that i attacked  travis and weve got the smoking thing right whats it called the censer  laura yeah that thing  travis what is it  laura the smoky thing  sam the censer  travis is it called a censer  matt yes  travis first try  liam and we learned that it does something too  sam it protects you from ghouley deads  liam from ghouley deads specifically  ashley will it protect all of us  taliesin i think its got a 
town	 range  laura if we stay in this tight  ashley if we stay tight  taliesin stay tight  sam so why dont we just walk through the center of town in the middle of the road with the  censer and walk into the tower no maybe  laura no i see nothing wrong with this plan  sam fly up to the top of the tower  travis oh no  taliesin stay on the ground  sam teleport somewhere  laura do you have that ability  sam she does  laura theres no trees on 
none	 the top of the tower  sam or we can be smoky mist  laura then itll take us a minute to not be mist anymore and by then theyll realize were there  on the top of the tower  travis should we take off the robes that they had and pop it on some of us  laura sure why not i mean were undead we look like were undead  taliesin i think they probably know were here i think they probably know were coming i think  lets just trepidatiously make our way a little closer 
town	 see what else is in this town see if  maybe theres anything useful  liam and stay lowkey we dont need to go marching  laura blend in  taliesin lets not blow anything up yet  sam but were making our way to the tower  taliesin making our way towards the tower in a towerly direction  laura are we at full health  taliesin no im not  laura im not either  ashley i can help with that  laura should we take a 30minute rest and roll some hit points  marisha did we 
dung	 fight oh no thats right we went down going through  matt yeah going through the actual portal the spinning ball of death caused some damage  laura i dont know if theres actually time for that though to take  taliesin im all right with mine im 20 points down i dont mind being 20 points down  sam lets be all full though we can be full  laura were going to fucking potentially fight delilah briarwood  sam yeah lets be full  marisha im assuming its going to take us some time just to even get 
none	 there though right  laura is it considered healing as we walk there though  matt no you have to take a rest  taliesin lets get a little closer then and survey the situation and then take a break i  feel like were a bit far  laura i just dont know if theres time if shes already started a ritual  taliesin if we run into something on the way there though i dont want to be at peak  performance yet  laura yeah all right  travis lets move  sam oh god  marisha 
none	 sure  taliesin this is going to be fun  marisha do we still have pass without a trace  matt you do for the next 30 minutes or so  taliesin so lets take advantage of this  marisha yeah lets at least move for 30 more minutes  travis whos got the censer in the front because weve got to stay together  sam someone in a robe  laura oh whos in a robe were all undead  marisha are me and you in robes  taliesin we can do robes im all right with robes  
none	 travis theres only three of them  taliesin ill take a robe  laura ill take a robe  marisha you lead with the censer  taliesin ill take a robe with the censer  matt okay percy and vex  laura yeah  matt okay you both throw robes on over your seemingaltered undead bodies percy youre  carrying the censer  taliesin yes im carrying the censer  matt and youre all slowly clustered behind them  taliesin yes  matt okay  marisha chanting  travis chanting  taliesin thank you  matt all right so you 
none	 guys continue moving whats very plainly towards the center of the city  as the tower stands as this giant beacon of shadow in the center of the horizon the streets are  scattered and broken you can see there was what may have seemed almost like a hint of cobblestone  at one point really just looks like largely broken and shattered badlands and dried stone that  seems to have been pummeled by impacts of some kind cracked into small pieces this is a city by  function and function alone there was very little considered in the 
none	 beauty of its construction at  least this far out as you continue to press towards the center of the city  laura i want to keep an eye out just to see if anybodys noticing if it seems like people are  paying attention to us in a way that they shouldnt be  matt okay well as youre keeping an eye out i would like all of you guys to make a deception  roll with advantage  marisha with advantage  matt yes  travis come on gil  taliesin thats not bad  sam 33  
town	 taliesin 21  marisha 17  liam 18  laura 17  matt pike  ashley 22  travis eight  liam too big  travis im sorry  matt as you guys make your way further down one of the not major thoroughfares but one of the  general streets that snakes around towards the central area of the city some of you gently  moaning and gurgling as you walk behind you you have grog frankensteining his way down the street  laughing  travis oh man  matt the sound of your rendition that song as youre 
none	 walking a shadow seems to cross a large  hulking shadow crosses past one of the roads and turns and begins walking your direction and you  see ahead what looks to be about a ten foot tall thick burly figure of brownish red flesh torn  and chains and hooks hanging from it it looks to be almost like an amalgam of large hobgoblin body  parts that have been sewn and stitched together with spikes and iron plates jutting through  keeping it together at the seams where there would be a face you see instead a giant 
none	 metal  mass that looks like a cage of some kind and behind it these two glowing beads of yellow eyes  poking through and you watch as it just walks in a straight line impacts  laura coming right for us  matt walking in your direction its arms are curled in front of it like a gorilla its fingers  dragging in the dust below it  liam does it look like its just happening in our direction or is it coming toward us  matt its hard to tell its about 60 feet up  laura is 
town	 there a road we can turn directions  taliesin is there a nonchalant way of maintaining direction but getting out of its way  matt there would be enough space to give about a ten foot berth to it as you put your back against  the side of one of the nearest buildings and let it pass  marisha like parting for the queen at the ren faire  matt a little bit yeah  liam or taliesin jaffe  marisha or taliesin jaffe at any party  ashley i move to the side and put my head down 
town	  sam whats our ploy if this thing tries to kill us  laura kill it  sam okay  travis same old same old  matt heavy footsteps you guys all make your way to the side and you watch its autonomous its  not being brought along with anybody its running a path down the road you all move off to the  side and as you maneuver to the side of it it gets close to the censer youre carrying and it  groaning puts its fingers out of the way actually crushing some of the stonework 
town	 on one of  the nearby buildings to pull itself aside trying to avoid the billowing of the smoke from the  censer it gives a dull deep resonant huff in your direction as it passes and then eventually  passes by the cluster of you that have all moved to the side after its head shifts and scans back  in the path that its walking and it moves past you following the direction you just came from  taliesin way to be fonzies  laura nice very nice so cool  sam wow this thing works  taliesin 
town	 lot of fonzies smells terrible  matt you continue further into the city you still hear the distant low shrieks of the gloom  stalkers shriek overhead swooping past in clusters circling around occasionally you watch  one or two swoop down and land on a distant rooftop and you hear the crunching of heavy stone  and whatever materials were still remaining on the roof of that structure as it lands and surveys a  bit and then whoosh takes off and joins the rest of its kin  taliesin do any of the buildings look remarkable or interesting 
town	 im trying to keep an eye out for  any building that may have anything inside it of vague importance either the building itself is  slightly more interesting or it looks like maybe someone has boarded something up to try and  maintain some kind of vigil against the darkness im not entirely sure out of the ordinary  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin i knew you were going to say that im not good at this nope nope nope thats a four  thats a natural one  matt a lot of these buildings are 
town	 hard to tell apart when theyre all just in this state of  disrepair and destruction  taliesin some of them have doors  matt some of them do some of them have windows kind of  taliesin holes where windows might be  matt possibly some you cant tell if its a hole or a window or a door  as you press forward  taliesin i felt orthax take over again  liam so this is osgiliath right its wrecked ruin no complete buildings or are any of them  matt you see some further in the exterior 
none	 appears to have been the most heavily sacked  theres been little intent to reconstruct from this point like i said youre still probably a  good mile and a half out from the center of the city and as you walk further in you can see more  clusters of skeletons traveling in groups of 12 to 15 somewhat erratically youve seen some  creatures that seem to walk with an intent pattern like they have some sort of a sentinel  path that they follow to keep watch on the perimeter or the roads of the city the 
town	 skeletons  that wander the undead that you see clattering about across the dusty cracked grounds between  the buildings are erratic uncontrolled mostly it seems to be less intentionally created undead  and more just risen by the nature of the plane you walk and havent bothered anyone yet or at least  those who live here as you begin walking forward you watch as a cluster of them spills into this t  intersection a little ways up a few of them falling and tumbling and getting back up  cracking as they cluster together some of them 
none	 bang into each other you hear the clattering of  metal from the bits of armor that still cling to their longrotted forms broken bones some of  them are missing arms or sections of a skull is exposed and cracked open on the side where you  can see what looks to be some sort of longdried and rotted away gray matter was left to slowly  collapse like a flan in a cupboard as you begin to approach that area they separate a bit and  scatter to fill almost diffusing in the center of this intersection and 
dung	 then they contract almost  like theres a strange hive mind magic that seems to draw them back together theyre just moving in  these autonomous clusters of chaos you see on them still similar to the ones you noticed  earlier some of the armor that theyre wearing appears to be reminiscent to the armor that the  black guard that you battled at the ziggurat earlier had or similar dark metal and others  have longdestroyed ruined scraped and scarred bits of silver and gold armor that are emblazoned  with longruined and defaced symbols of the dawn 
none	 father pelor  laura does it seem like both of those factions are still  are they clustered in the same groups  matt they are and you get the sense that whatever battle took place here long ago was  probably between these two factions and those that were lost in that fray have been risen over  time and wander aimlessly through the streets  taliesin free range undead  liam weve seen longdead people this is fucking creepy in the upsidedown  airplane noise sam whats going on  matt i called the airport to try and 
none	 coordinate this time with you guys cost me 17000 dollars  for that one fivesecond bit so enjoy it guys  liam worth it  matt totally worth it  liam these bodies compared to the exchampion of the raven queen do these bodies seem even older  more decayed do we have any sense for how old these fuckers are  matt you would have to get up close and that would be a medicine check would you want to try  and make your way close enough to one of these bodies to inspect it enough  liam 
none	 how far off are they  matt if you guys continue moving forward youll be at that intersection in about 30 seconds  liam im not going to go ill wait  ashley i could go up close with somebody and do a medicine check  laura keep up near the thing everybody get close to the censer  taliesin ill guide us towards something  liam yeah no one poking out ahead for this  laura hopefully theyll be affected by the censer  travis lets just stop by  matt so whos moving forward  laura the whole 
none	 group so we can all be with the wispy smoke  matt okay so you guys make your way towards this intersection  laura were normal people in robes  matt you also watch as you begin to walk further in that elements of the ground are growing more  jagged and craggy you can see bits of stone and earth are jutting out in large stone spikes  either through some upheaval or elements of the tumultuous landscape long ago that just caused  elements of rock to spike outward up five ten feet in sections you watch as 
none	 you grow close to  this intersection about half of the group all at once groan turns and looks in your direction and  begin to footsteps  laura can i just waft some of the smoke towards them  matt shamble in your direction the rest of the group noticing you begin blowing the censer  smoke that way you watch as three of the closest skeletons make their way into the fume and seem to  vaguely lose interest for a brief moment  ashley since were close can i do a medicine check are we close enough 
none	 to  matt yes but with disadvantage because of the smoke  ashley oh shit okay  laura you got this pike  taliesin roll like its a stealth roll  ashley 13  matt with the brief glances you have its hard to really tell plus youre not too familiar with  the overall weather of the shadowfell you dont know if theres enough weather to manifest as  general decay or if theyve been beaten by the ravages of time if it rains here or not its  hard to tell you gather it probably doesnt rain often 
none	 theyre definitely hundreds of years old  thats the most you can really tell they arent fresh dead these are long dead  liam im feeling foresighty can i creep up behind and do the same  matt i will say you can do that however you still have disadvantage because shes already  taken the roll and youre supplementing her roll in a very short period of time  liam would that be an even roll then since i have advantage on everything  matt you have advantage on everything im giving you a chance to do this when 
none	 normally you would  have none so the foresights allowing you to have a roll with disadvantage go for it  liam oh thats going to fail ooh 18  matt or not getting a glance at the one nearest to you the bodies seem to be fairly well  preserved for as long as theyve been here so you get the sense that there isnt a lot of heavy  weather here at all and given that fact the decay thats there it is reminiscent maybe not  quite as old as the corpse of purvon when you discovered 
none	 the tomb originally but comparatively  ancient at least over 500 years  travis old purvon  matt good old purvon  laura these skeletons are almost as old as you scanlan  sam good one  matt as you continue to walk forward and the skeletons part around the cloud of the censer you  push deeper into the city and they coalesce behind you and follow theyre keeping a perimeter  cluster now theyre still being held at bay by the wafting of this thick blackishgreen smoke  thats billowing off of it but theyre staying just outside 
none	 of it and slowly shambling at your  speed waiting for an opening  laura i have an idea what if right when we get close to the tower all of these trailing  skeletons that we have on us you just turn undead and then you control them all  sam you can do that  matt destroy them yeah  laura oh you cant control them i thought you could  ashley i could turn them  matt turn them means they just run away screaming  ashley i can make them run away  matt youre at 
none	 a level where you can just make them explode if they roll low up to you  travis weve got a little nuke in our pocket  ashley i want us to be quiet i dont want to make a big spectacle because i can make them go  boom boom but lets just wait  laura she can make them poop  taliesin and they dont even have bowels  travis is anything stalking us from above while were moving  matt how astute of you i was just about to get to that  travis did you hear 
none	 that astute  sam you put the ass in astute  laura hey did you guys know that travis is the smartest guy at the table  marisha i could tell by his cheers shirt  laughing  matt so in the billowing smoke thats coming around grog because you brought it up as well  as the twins who have relatively high passive perceptions and keyleth as well actually you  glance up and notice that the erratic patterns that a lot of the gloom stalkers take in the sky  theres two that seem to be circling and 
town	 circling  ashley i dont like it i dont like it  matt one of them shrieks and you watch as it goes into a dive in your direction  sam oh god in our direction  laura is there a building we can duck into  matt make a quick perception check  sam but quick  laura 33  liam 24  matt okay both of you really quick you see in two different directions past the intersection on  the right and on the left you see two buildings that are mostly still intact theyve sustained  
none	 some level of damage but they still have two solid floors maybe a partial roof missing but  they appear to be structurally sound enough to at least jump into they both have doors that are  partially ajar and a darkened interior  laura and a roof  matt and a roof  liam grunting  laura grunting why am i i can talk go in that building  travis yeah we go in there  laura that way they cant dive bomb us at least  taliesin i go in last censer  matt all right so you 
none	 guys all rush into the building on the right or the left  taliesin yours  laura the right  matt all right so the one that vex found you guys all rush into that building with percival the  last one in there as you  laura weapons drawn in case theres something in there  sam but also moving like zombies  matt okay perfect so as you guys all rush into the building weapons ready  whos first in the building  laura me maybe because we saw it  matt the two of you guys both 
none	 of you roll perception as you enter the interior of the  building the undead that are clustering behind you are beginning to gather in a semicircle as  soon as you hit the inside of the building and theyre clustering  at the door as you close it behind you  laura 20  liam 24  matt okay as you enter the inside you look around and you can see what appears to be the  remnants of a few tables very simple tables that have been shattered and destroyed broken into  ruin around the area you 
dung	 see what appear to be blades two left in the wall one broken off in  the center that have long rusted over time you see what appear to be the signs of bodies blood  dark dark dried blood circles on the ground but no corpses no bodies  taliesin im going to use the broken tables and swords to barricade the front windows or holes  im not sure which they are but im going to barricade them and the door use the sword to jam  the door shut  laura are there dark corners that anybody 
dung	 could be hiding in or another room  matt the room itself is pretty damn dark the little bit of light that comes in through the  distant broken elements of the wall theres enough light where you can kind of its very dim  light for you percy everyone else with darkvision is all right to make out the interior  liam cursory trap check even though it seems unlikely  matt make an investigation check  liam 19  matt no traps from what you can gather at this juncture but you do hear as you close the 
none	 door  and begin barricading it with percival you hear the multitudes of bony claws hands and bits of  armor slamming and brushing up against the outer wall that you just came through the doors bang  as the undead have now clustered and are trying to push their way in they seem to have a scent  laura well keep the censer near the door  marisha yeah i do a little gust cantrip and put a little of the censer smoke under the door im  like an oscillating fan  matt druids get pretty cool at 
none	 18 guys just saying timeless body oscillating fan best wild  shape ability ever  liam wait till you see the sprinkler system  matt so as youre blowing the smoke from the censer beneath the doorway it lessens the  impacts but the undead more than a dozen or so of these probably about 15 or 16 of them have  spread out and theyre all clustered at that side the little bit of the fumes that you can  push beneath the doorway are only reaching a handful and its keeping them from the main door  at 
none	 the moment  sam can we see outside at all is there a peephole or anything  matt there are no windows at the front of this building you see a sliver where it looks like a  portion of the wall suffered some sort of an axe or hatchet impact a long time ago and someone  tried to pull their way through its maybe about that wide and thats where the one source of  light is coming through  sam im going to go over there  laura wait  sam oh dont do anything  laura 
none	 i was going to say what if we turned ourselves into something else and snuck out and  they would think that were still in this building anything that was tracking us  sam i was going to try to make a little diversion to draw them away from the door  matt boom you guys hear a heavy impact on the roof above  sam ill do that ill do my thing  matt you hear boom what sounds like really heavy footfalls along the roof of the building  sam im going to look through the little sliver 
town	 and im going to cast  taliesin do you want to see what theyre burning in the censer  marisha yes i do thats exactly what i was going to do  taliesin im going to open up the censer  matt hold on just a second  sam im going to cast major image and make a small little human girl in the middle of the  street crying bleeding from the arm she looks disoriented and shes walking towards the other  building that we spotted very sad and whimpering  matt okay as you glance through and 
none	 create this image this image appears of this tiny  saucereyed french poppet of a girl with a little dress her curls are mussed up  travis dragging her dolly by one arm  matt its missing one button eye  liam you summoned cosette  matt yes basically and she goes running off screaming and crying you guys immediately hear  the shift of the undead beyond the door rumbling and begin getting fainter and fainter as that  happens you also hear whoosh scanlan you glance out and you watch the shadow of one of the  gloom 
none	 stalkers flying overhead swoop down and attack for the little girl  sam okay shes going to run shes going to book it into that other building to try to get away as  fast as she can and she can move super fast since shes not real  matt this is true this is actually very true  sam shes like the fucking flash  liam singing there is a lady all in white  sam 120 feet is all i can move her  laura shes sweeping as shes running towards the door  matt yeah you can 
none	 make her move with an action 120 feet so the little girl goes from whimper  to fast running and goes into a full sprint in a really creepy ringstyle way that was for you  travis across the way and you watch as the gloom stalker swoops up and impact slams into the side  of the stone building causing part of it to crush inward and break the roof partially rumbling  has to settle and it falls into itself as the creature rights itself shriek you now have a  much closer look at this entity and 
dung	 it is billowing black shadow like smoke off of it you  can see glimpses of some sort of physical form in there but its so blurry its almost like its  phasing between physical matter and dream youre not sure what its made from but you can see what  looks to be an elongated neck some sort of snapping jaw at the end and two bright  greenishyellow glowing beacons like eyes at the front of its face its wings dont have skin or  flesh its just dark smoke and as it flaps it leaves these trails 
none	 these curling bits like  black black black smoke  liam are we talking dragon size  matt its wyvern sized its maybe 20 feet from wingtip to wingtip  marisha is it anything like weve ever heard about  matt no you have not encountered a creature like this before but you watch as it glances and at  this proximity scanlan youre the one whos getting the view of this you watch wherever it  looks its eyes seem to emanate these tiny cones of light like little flashlights and as it scans  past the little girl 
none	 where the beam goes past her body is nothing there  laura is there another door in this building  matt there is on the back side yes its partially covered by what looks to be debris and  it looks like somebody else barricaded the other side but did not seem to cover both ends before  they fell within this building  sam lets get out of here  laura we should go out the other door as fast as possible  travis ill take care of that barricade  laura but quietly we dont want them to 
none	 know that were getting out the other side  travis i dont know if i can guarantee that  matt what are you doing grog  travis moving shit out of the way of the door in a  taliesin medium pace  travis lets call it a medium well  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  liam you are a terrible stage mom by the way  sam well she died  matt shes still there  sam she got her equity card  matt and thats what matters shes still there and you watch 
none	 the creature seems confused the  eye beams move past it and the little girls still there crying and still darting around the  area and the creatures like snarling lands on the ground and comes up and swipes and bites at  her and it goes through her form you get the sense these creatures arent super intelligent  but they are effective at seeing through certain glamors  laura theyre going to know that were not they know were not zombies  liam is it still after her or has it given up on that ghost  matt 
none	 its in the process of giving up on that ghost right now  liam still a cat and a flashlight  laura weve got to go  travis 21  matt at this point you watch as grog goes over with his giant mitts and singlehandedly shifts  the entire pile over with one shove exposing the door there before you  laura out the door out the door  matt you open the doorway  sam can we leave anything behind like a dead body or something for them to eat  laura what dead body  sam hes 
none	 got a ton of them in there  laura actually yes throw a dead body in the room  travis whos laughing now bitches dead body  matt and like the worlds most macabre flower girl you produce one of the  travis i birth from the bag of holding a dead body  laura and use dust of tracelessness as we run out the door so they dont follow us  travis whos giving the orders around here  laura me please  travis okay  matt so as you throw the body behind you the doors now being 
none	 slammed a bit it seems some of  the undead wandered towards that illusion some are still on the other side and now that youve  pulled the censer back from it the other doors kind of bangs coming pushed in you can see  light peeking through you guys rush out still with your seeming illusion on and you hear very  loudly almost omnipresent the screech the shriek of the gloom stalker right around the  corner from you as it begins to take off just on the other side of the building  laura should we look 
none	 for another building we can duck into to lose their so they cant find us  liam yeah we can just go hopping from building to building  matt i want everyone to roll a stealth check please  marisha do we still have  matt you do youre getting close to the tail end of it you have about five minutes left  laura natural 20  sam me too  matt shit  taliesin thank god we still have a thing  matt so natural 20  taliesin 21  laura did you add ten  taliesin yeah 
town	  marisha 36  liam 39  taliesin 22 i mean  laura natural 20  ashley 22  travis 20  matt okay  taliesin we did not roll well but were fine  matt so you all got above a 20 thats good  sam we needed above a 40  matt so you guys rush past and quick glance around you find one of the nearby buildings its  a little more dilapidated but it seems to have at least enough cover where you can all dive into the  shadows and seemingly vanish you all stand 
none	 there for a second and youre super quiet all  breathing heavily panting the censer still billowing this awful awful fume its filling  your nose your eyes are watering instinctually from the presence it stings just to get into your  sinuses but youre all enduring it and trying to be as quiet as possible  laura is there another door in this building that we can exit out  matt make a perception check  taliesin im showing keyleth whats inside the censer  matt okay well get to that  laura 19  matt 19 its hard 
none	 to tell it looks like where there may have been a door a portion of the roof  in here that has also collapsed it looks like a giant siege stone about that big from a catapult  was launched and tore through the roof and shattered that side of the building the only way  out is the same way you came in  laura fuck  matt unless you climb up and out but as you open the censer and look inside it looks like there is  this ember this cluster of burning dried herbs youre not 
none	 quite sure what it is or where it came  from but its currently glowing red in places  taliesin im going to give some of the herbs to keyleth to examine its like on a charcoal  matt it has what looks to be charcoal stones in the bottom clustered around and these herbs are  placed over it and its burning and smoldering over time  marisha sure can i tell what the herbs are  matt make a medicine check no this would be a nature check sorry  marisha thank you is this something that i 
none	 would get advantage on for my herb book  matt yes you would  marisha 28  matt okay i get to look this up  sam oh look it up its a real thing wow  matt its called wilds guide its a tobaccolike leaf that was used it was briefly  used for recreational smoking and treatment of small wounds but it tended to have a very quick  diseased sickening sense to it those that smoked a lot tended to get sick very quickly and it went  into disuse from there its largely considered to be 
none	 a relatively useless plant there isnt a lot  of medicinal quality to it its just something that exists in herbalism books  as things to avoid  taliesin comes in green and red available in the resident evil universe  matt you get the sense that them using it for the censer is probably not a widely known use for this  type of plant  laura you found a new use  marisha i did i write it down and i press a flower or i save some of it and then can i  druidcraft some more 
none	 now that i know what it is  matt from that cluster id say yeah you can create a little bit more but very little bit  marisha okay ill go ahead and make as much as i can  matt okay so you spend some time there to focus on it and from the remnants there you can make  about twice the amount than what was in the censer so you have probably a good solid  softballsized cluster  taliesin the resins the best part  marisha okay i take half put half back in the censer 
none	 and give half to percy does anybody else  want some actually should we dab ourselves with it no is that weird  laura maybe just give it to percy  matt really after all that no dab joke anyway  sam too classy for us  matt i guess so  taliesin whatever the opposite of standards are i know we have them  marisha give some to percy anybody else want some  laura yeah yeah i dont have any way to make fire but ill take it  definitely in my shirt now  matt as you 
none	 guys are doing this you hear the snarling and you hear the flapping wings  its hunting from building to building impacts closer flapping wings snarling a little  further away flapping wings  laura its gone did it fly away  matt sounds like it at least  laura should we leave and go to another building  sam lets keep going  liam building to building toward the tower  laura i feel like its not really gone  liam well well find out lets make a break for it  matt okay whos going first okay vax 
none	 as you dart along the side glancing up in the air you  can still see and it looks like there is some communication because where once there was maybe  two you can now see a lot of them have clustered closer in your direction there seems to be some  sort of an overhead hunt  laura should i cast pass without a trace on us again are we running out of time on it  matt youre getting pretty close yeah  laura im going to cast it again just so we dont  matt okay so 
none	 you cast pass without a trace again  liam and are we without a trace and dust of tracelessness thats just a one time  laura dust of tracelessness is just so they cant track us  matt so the second thing youve gathered these creatures are not very intelligent but they do  have some sort of communication between them and there apparently is a rush on their end to search  for whatever was recently spotted so as you guys make your way following vaxs lead down some of  the alleyways and begin slithering through the back 
town	 ways and the small side streets avoiding  your first attempt to walk straight through the center of the town  laura its crazy how that didnt work though i mean because it was a really smart plan  matt it worked for a bit not every plan is going to hold you to the very end there was some  cleverness to it so you begin to move through these buildings before it would be keyleth vex  and vax you guys come around one small alley and it opens up into another main road and this  roads 
town	 hard to avoid it seems to be almost a circular central road that marks the outer and  inner rings of thar amphala but you see there marking right across this road a 15 foot tall  wall that seems to lock in the inner cloister of the town  marisha how thick does it appear to be  matt make a perception check  laura maybe we can go under it  marisha or through it 17  matt its hard to tell from this perspective you have to get a better glance you have to find if  
none	 there was a break in the wall anywhere you do see what looks to be some variation in texture a  little ways to the right it could be a gate it could be a door it could be an opening or it  could be some change in its rather solid not very varied exterior  marisha go to the gate  sam yeah  marisha okay  liam why dont the halfelves go real quick just to stay small and quiet no clanking no crushing  you take a look at the wall and then we just call 
none	 everybody up  just two seconds if its the way to go  laura is it far away its like 15 feet from us you said is it farther than that  matt probably about 60 feet down to the right of you guys  liam so the change in the walls about 60 feet but the wall from our hiding spot is  how far away from us  matt across the way its about 30 feet from you its only about 15 feet tall its not crazy big  marisha ill see if i can discern something here 
none	 a little bit better you go go check it out  laura sure  matt so the two of you dart off to the side following keyleths impression of where she saw  this shift and as you make your way along the edge you glance over and you see two things one  there does indeed appear to be a small cut doorway in the wall maybe about six feet up  three feet wide thats designed for a single file passage of any creature that wishes to move  through its open theres no closed door there above 
none	 it just above it about eight feet up you  see what appears to be a deep cerulean blue gemstone about two feet across thats embedded  within the wall  liam i think its fine  sam just go through the hole  liam were good we found it  matt its a big blue stone about that big around its embedded  into the wall above the door  marisha i ask them how thick does the wall appear to be around that side  liam looking through the door can we tell how deep  matt yeah 
none	 actually you can its about three feet wide four feet wide  laura the depth of the wall  matt the depth of the wall yeah its a big heavy wall  travis vex i bet if you go real fast you can totally make it  laura good idea grog ill definitely try it  marisha i can try and stone shape through it  matt you two recognize at least theres something very familiar about that stone embedded  in the wall  travis its blue  matt its definitely blue its very similar in size installation and 
none	 functional placement as  the threshold crests that adorn the exterior of syngorn  laura which are definitely used wait to teleport things  matt the ones that are used to transport syngorn to the feywild and back  marisha oh weird oh no  laura oh my god if the ritual finishes they can teleport this whole fucking city shit  we have to stop this  marisha what if we dismantle the gems  taliesin we would probably have to dismantle a bunch of them  travis were out in the open dismantling thats pretty tough  taliesin 
none	 i feel like it would be easier to wreck the operator than try to break the machine  laura i dont know  sam i mean weve got a guy who crushes rocks all the time  laura yeah but i dont think its safe to touch those things  liam and the moment he makes a ruckus the air squad is coming down on our location immediately  marisha didnt we take some of that crystal didnt we take some of that  taliesin which crystal  marisha didnt we take shards of it from the thresholds in syngorn 
none	  laura i dont remember i dont have any in my bag  marisha one of them shattered and i feel like we took some  travis yeah i did  laura you did  travis yeah shards of blue crystal  laura matts like uh  marisha i dont know maybe its useful in this case  travis its not pretty its all broken  liam one question is if these stones are used to pull this tower into the main realms is there  another purpose to them here or is that doorway safe is what im wondering 
none	  laura no that doorway is in no way safe  marisha where was the gem embedded in the doorway  matt about eight feet up about two feet above the doorway  liam i feel like we should go through the wall or over it just on principle  taliesin we can go over it we do have a magic carpet  laura yeah and all the flying creatures are going to see us immediately we either go under  the wall how far from the wall to the tower is it does it seem  matt probably  
none	 laura can we see the tower through the doorway  matt you can see across and its not a straight shot but you can get low and you can see where it  breaks since you have a good sense of direction being the ranger id say you know its at least  under a mile  laura a mile to the tower so its probably two miles wide this whole  matt probably less its hard to pinpoint directly from what little you can see but its  definitely within a mile to a half mile of that door 
none	 that wall  liam kiki would you be able to great escape us underneath this wall  laura yeah thats what im thinking what if we go under the ground all the way to the tower  marisha is it unworked stone whats the ground like  matt the ground is unworked stone it is broken dirt and earth and stone from what you gather at  the very least a heavy layer of dust  marisha i could attempt to tunnel us there percy im sure you would know more than anyone  whats the likelihood that we might 
dung	 encounter that i might bust through a dungeon or something  though over there  taliesin that would be the question its a where do we come up b how do we tunnel without  collapsing a building on us and c what if theres buried dead  that havent been able to break  marisha i can get us under the wall for sure i can do both  its just figuring out what we want to do  taliesin if we can tunnel under the wall and then come up in a building  liam i think so 
none	 were not trying to get all the way there just past this  marisha okay can i stone shape  laura from within a building  marisha  a crawlspace through the wall  matt yeah you can probably do that let me look at the stone shape spell here real fast  marisha big enough for at least grog to marine belly through  travis were all undead so im a little smaller right now actually  matt well you look smaller  taliesin you look smaller than you are  matt youre still your same height  taliesin 
none	 you would be a little zombie floating stuck  laura can we be zombie cows  matt stone shape is instantaneous and its a section no more than five feet in any dimension  so stone shape would be just a onehit boom you could not create a long tunnel  marisha but i cant carve a shape through the wall to just crawl through five feet  matt oh through the actual wall itself  marisha yeah through the wall not under the ground i want to bust a crawl space through the  bottom of the wall  
town	 laura dont you think the flying guys will notice that  matt yeah that could work so do you want to do that  marisha its not a dynamite blast its like a rumble  sam yeah its just a hole in the wall  taliesin its like butter  marisha yeah its like butter so  matt okay so you dart across the open road to the other side where the wall is  marisha cover for me  travis how would we do that  taliesin we are stealthed  laura yeah  matt okay  laura can 
town	 i shit well you already rolled can i have been keeping an eye on the sky and give her  a go ahead when it looks like theyre not going to see her  matt you begin to do so as she runs across the road  marisha what  laura just go just fucking go  marisha okay  matt you hear the distant shrieks communication between the various gloom stalkers that snarling  echoing in the sky you make it all the way across to the wall and get low focus close your eyes  press your hand 
dung	 against the cold dark wall and feel it whoosh as immediately you carve a  circular tunnel through that goes completely to the other side seemingly to no negative effect  marisha seemingly to no negative effect ive made a tunnel  sam you sound different why are you using weird words  marisha im whispering im just trying to be more pragmatic  sam lets go  laura hey guys we didnt eat a heroes feast yet either  sam we didnt heal ourselves  marisha no we didnt  taliesin weve got to get through the wall  
none	 sam lets get through the wall and then well heal  matt okay  travis he is looking at each one of us and rolling  taliesin hes making eye contact and rolling a die like it means something  laura im not going to look at him  marisha keeping track why is he keeping track  liam if i dont look he cant kill me  ashley if you dont make eye contact  laura its like in school if you dont make eye contact maybe they wont call on you  matt yeah its the old warner 
none	 brothers rule so as you guys all one by one dart across and leap  beneath the tunnel that keyleth had created keyleth have you gone through the tunnel or are  you seeing everyone else through  marisha ill wait and see everyone else through just in case  travis oh how generous of you  laura we all are dead  matt you all begin darting through one after another  marisha im going to try and keep a lookout  matt keyleth you glance up as at the very tail end of it you have scanlan and 
none	 pike at the very  end ready to rush through the tunnel  sam were slow  matt because of the gnomish feet they both get there as you glance up and watch as one of the  gloom stalkers shriek and goes into a full screeching dive towards you outside of the wall  what are you guys doing  sam hurrying  ashley jumping through as fast as our little gnome feet can take us  matt okay so pike you dart through scanlan you dart through with the size of the tunnel  its easy enough for 
none	 the both of you to just run through while crouching as opposed to having to  get on your hands and knees so you guys start making your way through to the side pike you  make it out the other side scanlan youre halfway through keyleth youre still there  ready to go in after as its about to bear down on you  marisha its not coming up  matt oh no its going for a straight dive its going right for you  marisha oh god am i trying to do anything but get through  liam 
none	 youre running come on  laura she has to duck down  marisha i dont know ive got to crawl through  laura yeah so do you have protection do you have something you could turn into  marisha yeah thank you thank you im going to see it and immediately beast shape into a little  mouse and crawling sounds through  matt i want you to roll an initiative roll to see whether or not it gets to you in time  sam am i rolling too since im halfout  matt youre halfway in the tunnel it 
none	 couldnt fit in the tunnel if it wanted to  sam but i mean am i watching this  matt youre watching this  sam im going to roll okay  liam im going to say that i didnt leave the other side of the wall when i realized that she  wasnt coming through so waiting right in front of scanlan  marisha 18  sam two for me  matt okay natural 19 plus three so as you shift down into the tiny mouselike form its  claws immediately slam into and sink into the mouse body yeah 
none	 thats a 23 to hit  marisha yeah immediately poof  matt how much hit points does your mouse form have like one  marisha im assuming no more than a kittens worth  matt right so yeah so well say for the purposes one so that would be 16 points of  piercing damage so your form immediately reverts its claws now fill with your regular keyleth form  you take 15 points of piercing damage keyleth and you are grappled  marisha cool cool cool cool story cool  matt as soon as it grabs you it begins 
none	 to pull you out of the tunnel  and lift with you in its claws  ashley can i grab her arms  matt youre on the other side of the wall scanlans on the other side right now  liam im three feet away from you  laura yeah but hes in front of you  matt everyone else on the other side of the wall scanlan in the middle keyleth in the front you  saw it shriek and dive down you dont know what happened from that point you can glance down and  you watch as 
none	 keyleth is being pulled up you see that happening scanlan what are you doing  sam ill yell to the rest its got keyleth ill cast dominate monster on it i guess  matt okay so whats the spell dc on that  sam well i was probably not fast enough to pull up my horn so 20  matt thats a natural four plus three so as you say that and turn around you bring your hand up  and begin muttering the incantation and finish it with a flourish  sam i could have just done that this 
none	 whole time  matt as you finish the incantation you watch as a small ring of glowing purplepink glyphs appear  like a crown around the outside floating about three inches from the gloom stalkers head its  shriek goes intense to calm croaking and its just there hovering in the air about ten feet  up clutching keyleth  sam all right please deposit her on the other side over the wall  matt you guys watch as the gloom stalker wings flapping over the wall lands on the ground  slamming keyleth it slams you into the ground 
none	 as it lands  you take five points of bludgeoning damage  marisha wheezing you could have told it gently  sam i dont speak gloom  marisha five points  matt yes you wham and almost knocks the wind out of you and you slam into the hard ground but  the claws unfurl and leave you  marisha wheezing i made it guys im glad you made it  sam only 59 more minutes  ashley maybe he can tell the others to leave us alone  marisha yeah call them off  taliesin or maybe there are 
none	 birds on the other side of the wall  sam does he keep rerolling for breaking or is that it  marisha tell them its handled were dead  taliesin and then we can ride him  laura ask him if he has any money and ask him if he can make a good dinner because im hungry  marisha wheres the nearest 711  matt each time the target takes damage it has to take damage to get the save so its under your  control for an hour or until it takes damage  sam all right first 
none	 things first please go tell your fellow gloomy friends that the hunt is off  no more flesh down here and come back  matt croaking you can see that its landed its giant wings have folded under into these folded  knucklelike claws that hit the ground as it croaks and he gets really close and snarls at  you as it gets close the air gets colder in its presence its almost like it brings this drop  its already pretty cold here in the shadowfell but it becomes pretty much freezing as soon as it gets  
none	 within five feet of you it seems to suck heat out of the air as its glaring at you wings  flapping begins to take up you can see three other gloom stalkers who saw it dive earlier are  all arriving towards your location as it rides up towards them you hear gloom stalker speech and  the other ones gloom stalker speech snap at it circle it and they all have what looks like an argument  if there was and then eventually they break and they begin shouting off gloom stalker speech  you watch as the 
town	 heavy clusters that had been swarming this area of the town begin to respond in  kind you hear the echoes the cacophony of various screeches and screams and they all begin  to slowly dissipate and diffuse amongst the entire city of thar amphala  taliesin well that went well  laura good job scanlan  liam welcome back scanlan shorthalt  marisha thanks scanlan  sam its good to be back okay well need a name for him obviously  laura yes  sam so anybody got any ideas  laura benjamin is what im thinking  sam 
none	 benjamin is great  marisha mr mistoffelees  sam thats way better  laughing  taliesin can we ride him to the tower  sam well some of us can right by looking at him how much can he carry or she  matt youre not certain based on its size it could maybe carry three medium to small people  sam okay  marisha whispered whats around us right now  regular volume sorry whats around us right now  matt so as you glance around the other side of the wall the city is denser within this inner 
town	  cloister and the buildings all seem to be newer or repaired it seems like this inner sanctum of  thar amphala has garnished most of the attention of those that currently reside within its space  as you are glancing up too you see the flicker the faint flicker of the conjoining strands of  magical energy that are rising up to the pinnacle of the tower of entropis where you see these three  heavy clawlike fingers that jut out of the top of the tower all curve inward the flash is in the  center of it 
none	 its just glowing brighter and brighter that pulsing is pulsing its almost  like seeing this heartbeat of pure energy thats swelling and swelling  laura i dont think we have time to stop  sam well so no more healing but we could fly right up there and break that thing  marisha do we really not want to do any other healing  laura pike can heal us but we cant rest theres no time for a rest no time for a heroes  feast i bought those fucking chalices  taliesin next time  marisha might still 
none	 be useful  ashley how long does heroes feast take  sam like an hour or something  taliesin it will hardly matter  ashley we cant just take an hour  laura i think that thing is like going to go  matt its up to you guys its a gradual its not like all of a sudden right now you watched  it pulse as youve been getting towards youve been watching it slowly swell so who knows  sam some of us could get on mr mistoffelees and fly around the tower and see if theres a 
none	 window  that we could bust in or something  laura i wonder if delilahs on the top of the tower  sam yeah but well be on a thing so maybe we wont be very conspicuous  taliesin actually maybe if we ask mr mistoffelees im going to never get tired of  saying that to go up to the tower greet whoevers up there and throw them off  sam its just a pulsing orb of doom isnt it  taliesin just go up there and cause havoc  sam one of us needs to see whats up 
none	 there  taliesin no we can just send him up there and then we can head in through the tower he can just  be a problem  sam hes dumb what if comes back and hes like i dont know  taliesin just say go up there and if theres anything living up there throw it off  sam cant one of us go up there with him to scout it out yeah if someones invisible cant you  all be invisible  taliesin yes all of us  sam just me  taliesin yes its just you  
none	 laura cant you make all of us invisible  sam not while im concentrating on mr mistoffelees  laughter  taliesin i say we head in closer on foot if you want to ride mr mistoffelees up to the top of the  tower thats one thing but i think just sending him up there  or sending him to be an agent of chaos  liam i could probably ride him and if shit goes south i could get away  taliesin you could always get swallowed  liam by mr mistoffelees  laura by anything  taliesin i 
none	 get the distinct impression were going to have options before this day is over  marisha i feel like were going to have to do a lot of things to stop this  sam we need to get into the tower we dont even know how to do that  liam we dont know what were talking about which is why i think the idea to go scope it out  is a good one  laura does it look like theres any windows on the tower or is just a big old rapunzel tower  matt make a perception 
town	 check  laura okay  sam nope  laura well hold on 19  matt 19 still pretty good not a single window its a solid tower  ashley are there any doors no windows  matt you cant tell from your perspective right now the base is currently obscured by the very  very dense buildings  laura ultimate challenge for vox machina  travis should we check one of the buildings and then we can figure out who wants to go check it  out so we can get out of the open  laura yeah lets get 
none	 in a building and hide  travis because hes a cleaner  liam the tower is it obscured by all this shit happening on top of it vex can see theres no  windows can we see if theres a rooftop to it at all  matt there is a top to the tower  liam is it this is it this or can we not see  matt the tower gently tapers and then comes to an end there is a top you see theres three giant  curled fingerlike black spires that curl inward on the outside inward 
none	 and then theres the  platform where the tower stops where it seems like there would be somewhere to stand  laura the thing thats glowing is off of the ground of the tower  matt its filling up the entirety of that space between the fingers  on the actual roof of the tower  marisha what if it has to keep expanding all the way to the crystals  travis whats the nearest building is there one building thats closest to  where we came through the tunnel  matt yeah you guys are about ten feet from 
none	 the nearest building  travis can i walk over are there any windows  matt this building does not have any windows  travis does it have a door  matt it does  travis can i knock  matt knocking you watch as an older gentleman with a very thin gray goatee looks a little  sallow missing his left eye he currently has a small sack over his shoulder he opens the door  can i  travis hey come here and i grab his face  matt muffled yelling  laura inside inside  travis we just 
none	 go in push in  taliesin well were going in now arent we  liam and were walking and were walking  sam ill tell mr mistoffelees to do a 90second loop and come back down and check in on us because  he cant fit in the door right  matt no  sam fly around 90 seconds and swoop back down  matt he does a small circle as you guys all rush into the building you enter the inside you see  what looks to be a lot of building materials it looks like some of the 
town	 outer buildings here were  used as the storage facilities for what a lot of the city was rebuilt as theres nobody else  inside right now this gentleman looks like he was on his way out of the building as you interrupted  him as now most of his head is just clasped by your giant goliath titanstone knuckleadorned  hand you see a little bit of his eye peeking over grogs and hes like muffled yelling  travis shh  matt you see hes got the heavy male pattern looks like the old dd dungeon master from the 
none	  cartoon hes bald on top has long gray hair that goes past his shoulders very thin missing the  left eye and hes just limp hes not even going to fight it  laura oh hey we were sent here by delilah briarwood you may know her  matt muffled yelling  laura right the ritual thats happening on top of the tower how long until that  things done  matt muffled noises  laura blink once for 15 minutes blink twice for an hour or more  liam three times for a bunch of days  sam 
none	 maybe he doesnt know  laura yeah do you know blink once for yes blink twice for no  matt muffling noises  sam 15 minutes no that was once for 15 minutes  laura no that was an hour at least  marisha i thought he blinked before are we at an hour and 15 minutes  taliesin i dont think you can call it a blink if youve got one eye  i think its just a wink  marisha a wink man semantics  matt you get the sense that as you say that it does hurt 
none	 him a little his demeanor while  already pretty shattered just even further sad noise  travis does he have any pouches on him or anything in his hands  matt he had a small sack over his shoulder that he was leaving with  hes just adorned in regular  travis is the sack on the ground now or is it still over his shoulder  matt no its currently on the ground he dropped it as soon as you rushed and pushed him  travis i take the satchel and i give it to pike and say look 
dung	 in here  matt you glance inside as soon as you grab it you hear the clanging of metal you look inside  and you can see what appear to be a handful of dark metal shortswords daggers simple dried  rations and in fact as you glance inside the room now you can see a lot of the supplies here  aside from construction supplies you see a handful of weapons that are wellmade  recentmade not seen battle yet  sam theyre about to invade  laura what if we burn the fucking city down  sam i 
none	 mean sure what  laura i mean if theyre planning on transporting this whole fucking city and setting an army loose  on our world why dont we just burn the whole fucking city down destroy their rations destroy  their weapons  taliesin i am excited by this plan  sam wait what no thats terrible  liam lets burn down manhattan how do you do that  travis shall we ask this gentleman some questions all right im going to remove my hand  obviously youre like really cool with the purpose perspective of dying and ill quicken 
none	  that if you make a loud noise right like if youve ever seen like jello mixed with like  apple pudding thats what ill do to your head  matt make an intimidation check  laura you did your hand signal for arnold palmer  travis i did  matt universal  laura arnold palmer  travis 22  matt 22 he doesnt make a sound more than the gentle trickle out of his pant leg does laughs  taliesin i think thats a yes  travis grab the scruff of his collar  matt okay as you release 
none	 he gasps his teeth are broken and yellow his one gaping socket is  twitching a little bit from the recovery of the sudden rapid series of events that he was not  expecting today as he gathers his breath and scratches the side of his leg  so what do you wish to do to me  sam nothing weve got to hurry  laura no really do you know anything about the ritual  matt i mean not the specifics  laura do you know if its going to be over soon  matt i know that some 
none	 of the acolytes were rushing through expediting things recently  marisha why  matt i dont know  sam did they tell you to gather weapons  matt they just told us to be ready  liam for what whats the plan here man youre really far away from anything fucking nice  matt you watch him close off as you start saying that he catches himself saying too much  information his demeanor goes cold  laura please we know youre going to transport to another plane  marisha youre trying to bail arent you were you trying to 
none	 run  sam no hes joining the fight  laura oh my god he was going to leave  travis well hes clearly clamming up i put my hand back over the front of his face i take the  other one put it on the back of his face and i start making my fingers touch  matt muffled groaning he reaches up and grabs the small symbol familiar loop with the fork  above it he clasps it in his hand and doesnt resist  travis do you want it  ashley yeah put him a little lower 
none	 grog i rip off the necklace  matt hes like clasping it in his hand make a strength check  taliesin drop it drop it  ashley oh my god were so terrible  travis are we  ashley natural 20  matt hes clasping it and you can see his one eye rolls back to hold onto it and hes muttering  a prayer beneath your fingers and hes muffled muttering and you tear it from his grasp  muffled panic  ashley well give it back youve got to answer some questions for us  travis no he

none	 get the sense that they may or may not most of the supplies do come from outside  the shadowfell  laura lets poison the water supply  marisha i take a little bit of the water and control it and let pike wash off a little bit  matt okay  ashley i think i got a little in my mouth gagging  liam wait theres a little bit of skull right there all right  taliesin thats the little chunk where the joint is its just this little bit it just breaks  naturally if you put pressure

none	 of the ritual  liam wheres your pet lets go find some shit out  marisha he had rations no one takes rations  laura he was handing out weapons  taliesin it was like carpentry of the damned sort of thing  marisha what if the giant orb has to reach the crystals  taliesin it might but it might just do the buzzing exploding  laura technical terms  marisha yeah the buzzing exploding  taliesin its magic its the best ive got  travis whos going up  sam me and vax  travis just you two

none	 you dont know  travis okay especially me  matt yeah you especially dont know  liam times awasting scanlan lets go  sam lets go mr mistoffelees  matt as you open the door there just landing landing gloom stalker croaking you guys climb  onto its back  sam yes we do  matt you climb onto its back touching this creature is like touching the inside of a freezer  even with gauntleted hands you have to wrap some of your cloth around to not give yourself  frostbite over a period of time even resting on 
none	 it especially with your leather armors it chills  you to the bone as you take up and even just ten 15 minutes into wings flapping up into the  air gathering as to whether youll be noticed or spotted by this you can feel it beginning to  chill you your teeth are beginning to chatter from being in that proximity of the freezing cold  creature its strange as you touch it it feels less like fur and flesh and more like youre  grabbing onto a very very thick sackcloth like it tugs and pulls and it 
none	 feels almost like the  scruff of a cat or dogs neck but it has a clothy texture and as you grab it you can feel the cold  wisps of shadow and darkness obscure your hands you feel like youre plunging your arms into it  but you find purchase within that shadow and hold on  sam well need to spoon for warmth  liam i nestle in behind scanlan  sam i gladly accept  liam lets ride  travis lets ride  laughing  matt all right so as you guys take up into the sky

none	 of you are making your way as  stealthily as you can on the back of a gloom stalker as it encircles the exterior of the castle  entropis first off i would like you both to make a stealth check  liam i squeeze the gnome tighter  laura oh god i think youre out of range so you dont get the plus ten anymore  liam thats okayish  sam 21  taliesin you have advantage though on everything  sam hes fine  liam 34 a low 34  matt okay so you guys begin to circle 
none	 the exterior of the tower making a wide spiral along  its exterior you make your way up its hard to gauge the full height of this tower but its at  least six or seven stories tall if not taller i want you both to make perception checks please  liam now that were closer im looking for windows that she might not have been close enough  to see doors holes anything  matt perception check  liam yes sir  sam natural one im under his body  matt hes curled up within vax  liam hey 
none	  matt not even a top or bottom circumstance youre just within  liam it really just depends on the day 26  matt 26 okay no windows it is a solid tower completely around as you cycle around as you get  towards the top of it you notice the three curved fingerlike spires that curl up at the top and the  pulsing of the energy you watch as these very faint tendrils of magical energy that youve tuned  in to be able to see better now that you know what to look for are all from 
none	 this height you can  see the long strands are undulating and shifting almost like the very winds of the land are causing  them to rotate you can see the variations in their form but theyre all still merging and  entwining at the very top of entropis you see nothing you can see what appear to be a cluster  of about 30 or so figures all gathered along the top of this you can see what appear to be three  glowing spheres in a triangular pattern around this that are accepting the tether of the magical 
none	  energy and then suffusing what appears to be a small altar of some kind in the very center of the  top of this tower  liam mother bitch  matt youve been circling here for about 15 to 20 minutes or so and the energy explosion noise  untethers and unfurls theres a shockwave of warmth that cascades outward from the top of the  tower both of you feel it pass through you and that freezing cold that youve been trying  desperately to hold at bay as youre clutching onto the back of this gloom stalker 
none	 this heat  wave moves past the gloom stalker squawks instinctually pulls back and you can see for a  second it drops and you feel your stomach bottom out as it loses about 20 feet of elevation before  catching itself again and you watch as any of the others that are currently cycling around  the stratosphere over the city of thar amphala also are taken off guard by the sudden burst of  energy as you glance over you can see the tethers that connect have all fallen and faded  music changes  sam quietly how 
none	 does he do that how did you do that  matt you also watch as about 25 or so of these figures at the top all collapse at once  liam but some are left  matt there are some left you watch and very faintly you can see on that altar in the center  there is a small bead of pure vibrant bright white light you watch as a robed figure that  previously was held in the shadows emerge youre too far away to make any more details than that  liam a lot of motherfuckers just 
none	 died on the top of that tower you felt that  sam what do we do is that the end of the ritual  liam how much time left on that hour buddy  sam enough to get back to our friends probably  liam weve got to go  sam should we attack now just the two of us  liam no we should not do that  sam we could  liam we could  sam between you and me were the most powerful ones in the group  liam i just dont feel like freeballing it right 
none	 now and id really like the group  sam i know but will you at least confirm that yes we are the most powerful  liam clearly we are the most as the kids say op lets get back to the group  sam all right hold me tight mr mistoffeles back down  matt it goes into a rapid dive making its way back towards where you left the rest of your  party the rest of you you can go ahead and regain your short rest you get your wild shape  back you can spend any hit 
none	 dice to heal up if youd like if you havent already  laura i already did it  matt okay good i also need all of you to roll a wisdom saving throw please  sam everybody  matt everybody who was on a short rest  laura if we had had a feast wed have advantage on this  marisha we would  matt all right so  taliesin 14  marisha 30  laura 24  ashley just to make sure i used gnome cunning because i get advantage on wisdom  matt its not a magical effect 
none	  ashley okay so then ill take my first roll which was two and then i will add my wisdom  saving throw number which is ten so i have 12  travis 19  sam i want you to explain every roll  matt in the rest you take the shadowfell does not seem to have  any adverse effect on your presence  taliesin however  matt theres no however you complete your rest fine you guys all gather your stuff you take a  breath and prepare for the next leg of your venture as the door 
none	 to your building slams open  scanlan and vax arriving just leaping off the back of the gloom stalker that they had under  their control who is also about to lose its  taliesin how much longer do they have  sam fly away  taliesin attack the tower tell it to attack the tower  sam really its going to forget halfway there  taliesin maybe we can mess one person up  sam fly away just fly away  ashley on the rest could i have worked a little bit more on enchanting the silver bullets  
none	 matt you can spend a little more time on it itll take a few days of getting that to happen  ashley i just keep working on it  laura did we feel that whoosh within the building  matt you didnt you may have heard something strange but it didnt really catch your  attention you guys spent your time resting on the inside of the building  laura whatd you see  liam saw a lot of fucking people just die on the top of that tower i cant guarantee it but i  think its a safe 
none	 bet that your girl delilah is up there  laura thats where i figured shed be  sam it seems theyve completed at least some part of the ritual  liam yeah there was some sort of massive pulse of energy 20something hooded figures just  dropped dead on the spot a wave of some shit blasted through us  laura can i run out and look at the tower and see if the orb looks different  marisha i join vex  matt you guys rush out and peek outside of the doorway towards the top of entropis you 
none	 see that  the glowing pulse is gone the energy tethers from the siphons are gone  laura fuck  marisha i look around are we still in the shadowfell  matt perception check  marisha thats not great 18  matt thats enough yeah youre still in the shadowfell  sounds of relief  travis motherfucking mercer that intonation  taliesin if you rolled low enough hed be like you dont know seattle  youve taken us to seattle  laura well we should fucking get up there then huh  sam should we go straight up the tower 
none	  liam what else are we doing here  sam yeah all right  taliesin lets head to the base  sam but were going to fight an aerial battle against supermagical things  marisha oh my god  liam were weighing risk here what do we think would happen if  we spent an hour having that feast right now  travis actually thats true nothings going to change at this point  sam maybe  marisha i mean maybe we should return to something like sabotaging the machine or  burning the city oh god vex is rubbing 
none	 off on me  laura did you see delilah up there  liam no there was a ringleader but we were too far out  laura and the ringleader was still standing  liam yeah  ashley how many people were still standing  matt that would have been three that you noticed  liam precisely three  laughter  ashley lots of them died in the blast  sam yeah so its not even going to be a tough fight well just  take down three people and be done right  laura so easy  taliesin the less 
none	 people were fighting the worse it is  marisha agreed  ashley it wont just be three  taliesin it might be four  sam itll be less than three  laura even one with that fucking wall she had last time were fucked  marisha how far did the blast go that you saw  liam we were 100 yards out or something  matt yeah you were probably about 300 feet out  laura we didnt do any research on that wall did we that spell did anybody do any research on  that spell that we saw 
none	 her do down in the ziggurat  taliesin we kind of figured out what it was it was a modified version  of a spell weve seen before  matt kind of yeah it seemed to be prismatic youve seen prismatic spray its a prismatic  spell in nature but you didnt really research any means of defeating it or bypassing it  travis do you still have that earthquake spell  marisha i believe me and pike both do yes  travis we couldnt like earthquake the tower to the ground could we  marisha between me you and 
none	 pike we can take this tower down  sam is that true  travis i just dont know about us going to the top if we could maybe bring it  taliesin oh if we could maybe bring the top down here  sam thats a good idea if you can really do it  travis i just dont know how big around it is it might be fucking huge  taliesin how big around is the tower  matt at the very base  taliesin hes looking at the tower  matt  its about 170 180 feet in 
none	 diameter  marisha hang on 180 feet in diameter hang on pike and i check our spellbooks real quick  taliesin can i do a little engineering if i were going to punch at it  liam also the idea that were going to sneak into that tower is farfetched  sam no we either have to fly up to the top or bring it down to us right  laura i like the idea of bringing it down  liam even if it fails the fight will still come to either we bring the fight to them or we 
none	 rip  down the tower and bring the fight to us  marisha for up to a minute and a hundred foot radius centered at a point  matt it deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area  when you cast the spell if it drops to zero hit points it collapses and potentially damages  nearby creatures so the question is do you think thatll be enough to drop a solid obsidian tower  laura its a tough call twice in a row  marisha but i mean two earthquake spells 
dung	 and grog  laura i have a siege arrow  marisha i will point out this will be burning mine and pikes 8thlevel spell  but it might be worth it  sam it feels like its a 32 earthquake we need a 62 earthquake  travis thats true we do lets be honest we really do need a massive shake  laura what if we weaken the outside and then hit with the earthquake  marisha i can tunnel out underneath it  taliesin i think whatever was going on up there is gone i think its happened  
none	 laura well delilahs still up there so if she falls at least she takes some damage  taliesin thats fair  liam im just going to throw my vote in the ring here that i think we should take the time for the  feast you know were not killing piles of rats in the sewers here this is serious  sam when last time we fought delilah were any of us scared of her  taliesin shes not what im afraid of  laura wisdom saving throws are major she could take control of us  travis im not 
none	 against that but i think one person should stay out of the feast and keep an  eye in case they leave in the hour that were feasting  sam well if someones going to stay out of the feast it should be the guy who already has  advantage on everything  travis oh that too yeah i just cant get afraid thats all i was going to say  laura yeah but you can be taken control of with your brain grog  travis thats assuming a lot  taliesin damn it  ashley shit  travis or 
none	 we just go get it we just go after it and go get it  sam im against the feast i think we should just run in  laura i just dont feel like theres time honestly  sam also im vegan i dont know if i could eat everything at the feast  liam it is largely gofibepo  sam gofibepo why didnt you just name it a poobah platter  laura oh that would have been way easier  marisha how far are we from the tower in this little house  matt in this house youre a 
none	 little over a half mile away from it  taliesin its a tenminute walk  matt so this house is just outside of the perimeter wall of the inner cloister  marisha you guys could do the feast and some of us can help tunnel out  the ground during that hour  taliesin i dont know i dont think were going to bring it down  grog i dont know if were going to bring it down it was a cool idea but i dont know if were  going to do it were no white ancient dragon  
dung	 ashley whats it made of obsidian  matt you havent been close enough to really tell but it looks to be made of a very thick  dark obsidian or onyxlike material  liam its also unsettling as fuck right  laura oh its probably magically protected  liam probably  taliesin it may just hover there if we knock this  laura that is very true  taliesin it may be keeping the ground up as opposed to being sitting  on the ground at that point  marisha so were going to try to fly up  taliesin 
none	 or walk up through the inside  grog raise your hand if you want a heroes feast  liam for you all yes  travis four  sam is that a raise or not  travis are you scratching your ear or are you raising your hand  taliesin yes damn it  sam wait so are we four  ashley im just nervous i know we dont have time but what if this is one of those decisions  where later were like we should have fucking done a heroes feast  travis well lets do it  ashley 
town	 i dont know though i dont know if we have the time this is hard  travis well the transaction upstairs has already happened whether they get away or not  marisha i have a feeling were going to be down here a while  laura maybe we can prepare the feast keep an eye out if we have to ditch out on the feast early  then we do  marisha keyleth looks out the window again are people panicked are people running around is  there a rabble in the street  matt theres no technical window in 
town	 this building theres the door  travis she just pushes her head against the wall  matt so you look out the door and glance through you do notice theres no panic but you do see a  number of and this is interesting you glance out and you dont see any undead wandering the  streets of the inner cloister at least not like the outer area was you do see make a perception  check actually  marisha oh thats good 30  matt you see throughout the street which the street from here gets about halfway to 
none	 the tower  before it hits a building and curves around you see maybe 35 or 40 total people in matching or  close cultist robes or similar colors all making their way towards the tower  taliesin theyre dressed for an occasion fuck it just go  laura we got to go 35 to 40 people lets kill em all on the way up  marisha man youre frosty today youre just  laura theyre trying to come over into our territory i dont like it theyre all assholes  travis shall we go in  marisha well how 
none	 are we going to go in though just flying up  taliesin we have one broom we dont have two brooms anymore  we got a carpet and we got wings  laura and a couple people with wings oh god the creepy music is starting  we gotta go yall  liam beeline to the tower  marisha and then what and then what though once we get there play it by ear  taliesin throw everything off the top break everything smash everything  laura its delilah shes going to destroy us do we have any way to 
none	 neutralize her magic  travis well you could turn into a no  marisha i cant i gave vax foresight i cannot turn into a beholder today  sam i can  taliesin you can  sam yes  marisha do you have shapechange  sam something like it  gasping  taliesin all right this is almost a plan lets do this  travis its more than we normally have  taliesin its far more  laura are there a lot of gloom stalkers around  matt you can tell with the loss of magical energy that theyve been 
none	 tossed askew a bit their  patterns of circling and being intent theyre a little more scattered a bit but there are still  maybe a few dozen that look over the inner cloister  taliesin lets make our way to the tower and maybe head up through the tower we dont have to  necessarily fly up to the top  laura wait a minute did the orb at the top turn the same way that the orbs in the ziggurat turn  matt there were faint orbs that were taking the energy and focusing it towards that center 
none	 altar  and when everything faded after the shock wave what you saw looked like the tiniest star it was  just a speck of extremely bright light that to look directly at it hurt  travis i dont know i dont just go get it  marisha im honestly still kind of into the earthquake idea bringing down the tower im not  going to lie  sam thats not going to work  marisha how do you know  sam you said 50 points of damage  taliesin i can take 50 points of damage i can take 
none	 two earthquakes personally  sam i mean just from a metagaming scenario thats not even that cant even hurt  marisha no no no the tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact  with the ground in your area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns  until the spell ends and the spell lasts a minute  sam so you get ten 50s  marisha ten of those ten 50s  laura oh and then times two  marisha with pike and i  sam so thats 1000 points 
none	 over a minute thats better than i thought  liam is it concentration  marisha its concentration for up to a minute and it has a 500foot range and a 100foot  radius so pike and i could split half and half of the tower  travis its pretty fucking hollywood i kind of like it  taliesin all right all right lets do it  marisha i feel like if we go right up to the top of the tower its like walking into the danger  taliesin lets bring the tower down to us  marisha this is 
none	 insane  liam and you can still fuck shit up while you got that earthquake going right  marisha well how do you mean  laura oh yeah if you have that spell going you can do other things in case things attack us  liam are you just doing earthquake the whole time or are you just standing there staring at  the ground  marisha its my concentration so i can keep it going and do an instant reaction spell  matt do other things you cant do another concentration spell  liam but youre not lightning anybodys 
none	 ass not doing anything like that  youre focusing on the tower  marisha i mean i can throw a fireball and keep it going yeah  liam thats really big all right  taliesin i say the movers and shakers get the cloaks lets head out  laura get up as close as we can to support pike and keyleth  taliesin and we keep them safe we are playing defense  laura yes  marisha god i hope this works  taliesin god i hope this works too  marisha i dont know if this is going to 
none	 work  laura this is stupid as fuck  taliesin were distance anybody gets near them we take them out  marisha grog can you at the right moment just do a big see if you can topple it over  travis i can try and do whatever you want i can run around and punch  a bunch of holes in it whatever  taliesin were going to focus everything on one side of the tower were going to try and bring it  down in a direction here we go  laura yes focus it on one side 
none	 of the tower both on the same side  taliesin like a tree lets do this this is a terrible plan all right  laura just trying to gauge matt  marisha i know matts stone cold  taliesin matts thinking about all the other people he could be playing dd with right now  laughing  taliesin hes imagining a whole other set of faces here  liam all right lets teleport inside that dragon come on  matt yeah whats the plan guys  liam thats the plan  laura were going to get close enough so that 
none	 they can do their 500 feet distance but keep a  distance to the tower  marisha and if we can be hidden while were doing this instead of being open we have a 500foot  range here weve got a dopeass range  taliesin keyleths got a cloak pikes got a cloak  travis im huge  taliesin hes huge  laura were going to try to get in a building thats closer to the tower  matt okay seeming lasts for eight hours so youre still under the guise of that illusion  sam although we dont  
none	 laura  need that anymore  taliesin well we can look like cultists  sam keyleth you said that theres no other undead around here right maybe we shouldnt look  like undead then  taliesin can you shift what we look like without changing it  sam i dont think i can shift it no you cant thats a onetime thing  laura maybe just drop it and well be cultists  marisha how many robes did we swipe  sam weve got the one from the guy whose head we just crushed  matt you would have four 
none	 cloaks because theres two you got from the outside at the ritual and  theres the one from the guy you killed when you got here well technically there was the two  that you killed when you got there but you didnt say you grabbed those oh you did you grabbed  them off so thats two five six you have six cloaks  laura yeah and then the one the guy that we just killed in front of the   matt that was included  sam me and pike she could be on my shoulders and we 
none	 could share one cloak  laura yeah thats good  travis i have that cloak of smashing that percy gave me  marisha totally little rascals it oh i love it  laura yeah well just robe it up  matt you guys all throw on the  ashley i almost feel like it should be the other way around  sam oh it absolutely should  laughter  matt six cloaks seven players you guys are straightup doing i am so proud of everything  that has just happened  laughter  sam to make it look like our 
none	 arms can reach the ends of the cloak are they sleeved cloaks  matt yes they are  sam im going to hold a flute and my sword  laughing  liam mythcarver you used mythcarver to pull a little rascals  matt there will be no survivors  taliesin the dread pirate roberts is here for your souls  liam hey guys its the third time scanlan has used mythcarver  laughter  marisha thats a vestige right there  taliesin its gone from exalted to shamed  matt it retracts into a dagger now  taliesin never happens 
none	 this never happens  matt all right in a hip montage you pull out the various cloaks assemble your materials  getting ready  taliesin we are a bunch of assholes  matt scanlan hops on top of pike the cloak is placed over you you get your sleeves ready and  you all walk out into the cold air of the shadowfell making your way  towards the center of the city  marisha be cool be cool  liam im also going to say some time in the last several hours i dont remember what the armor is 
none	  set to to necrotic  matt i think you may have said that before you went in just in case  i assumed that was the case  laura i think that was already there yeah  taliesin and remember if anyone looks at you close one eye just be winking  always be winking left eye  laura does everybody have their arms that weve run into so far or are they missing an arm too  an eye and an arm or just an eye  matt it varies not everyone seems to be missing a hand 
town	 but most of them are missing an eye  laura okay  liam you all look like my sister  marisha you need to get your eyes checked then your depth perception may be off  sam all right we go  matt all right you guys make your way up the street following behind the few stragglers that  you see trying to catch up with the rest of the groups of people that have filtered out of the  buildings and made their way towards the center you make your way through some of the side roads  
town	 following around and you can see now that the closer you get to the city the more the  structures the buildings here are built in a spiral the roads dont intersect at spokes they  all gradually curve in to the tower if youre looking at it overhead it looks like this large  spiral into the tower like a pinwheel you follow the curvature of the road which prevents you from  seeing the end point and as you begin to get close to some of the clusters of people that are  walking with a brisk walk 
none	 but still walking towards the tower you fall back a little bit to  not draw any attention as youre making your way there you watch as two individuals hurry up that  were a little bit behind you and rush up to the side and are walking in pace they glance over  marisha hoods forward  matt one of them who appears to be a younger man probably 18 19 or so whos got this little  patch of reddish brown chin fuzz and looks a little malnourished he still has both eyes he  rushes up real 
none	 fast his hood pulling back a little bit and hes looking around excited but  also with trepidation so its happening huh its really happening  laura i guess so  liam its fucking wild  laura so exciting  sam im so excited to be here  laura oh dont  matt make a deception check  travis keep your mouth shut just keep your mouth shut  marisha just nod and smile  sam 24  matt he looks at you and goes oh i didnt know the whispered one takes the special ones too  travis yep 
none	 sure does  taliesin what are you going to do after  matt i dont know  taliesin surely youve thought  matt im pretty low on the totem pole here im just excited to be on the right side of history  laura ditto  liam fuck the normies  matt all right and he rushes up past you guys to try and catch up  sam so awkward  laura i think he bought it i think we played it really cool there guys  marisha im really bad at holding my eye shut for this long  
none	 taliesin so are we close enough now that we can start this  matt not yet youre about maybe 1000 feet or so away  taliesin im going to see if theres any structures that are within distance so that once  they set up and start i can get to them maybe we can perch  marisha we only need to be so far out  taliesin we can cover you from a roof  matt perception check percival  liam also wondering how were doing in the gloom stalker department  matt no ones seen you currently it 
town	 seems that whatever piercing vision they have it does not  seem to pierce robes  laura i want to keep an eye out for buildings too  taliesin 15  matt okay then you as well make a perception check  taliesin please  laura 23  matt 23 okay you glance about and there are a lot of buildings here with vantage points theyre  all similar heights there are a few that are outliers but most of them are one and a half to  two stories like a one story with an attic or an attic 
town	 space like a halfstory or two stories  you do check a few that are thirdstory and a lot of them are almost in steeplelike spires at the  top you start to notice there is a theme a lot of the buildings closer to the tower are built in  a similar theme as the tower itself you begin to see the edges of the roofs curve up into their own  spikes and the further in you go the more dangerous and unwelcoming the deeper inner  cloister of thar amphala is to witness you can see now 
dung	 certain people are climbing onto the  roofs theyre getting up there almost like theyre preparing for some sort of a festival or a  fireworks show  marisha like the fourth of fucking july  laura the aliens are coming and were welcoming them  travis well theyre not wrong  matt you notice vex theres been no change in daylight or nightlight here its been this  constant deep dark gray gloom that hangs over the shadowfell unchanging unshifting theres a  creeping brightness on the horizon that you feel rising  laura were getting ready to teleport 
none	  matt and you watch as that creeping brightness forms a dome over your space and then comes to a  close over the top of the tower and where once there was this gloomy skyscape you now see what  appears to be a brighter clouded sky the temperature grows a little colder and you begin  to see snowfall gentle snow begins to fall and you watch as some of the cultists surrounding  start reaching up and catching it in their hands  taliesin now now  sam weve still got to attack  marisha its totally 
none	 taken us to whitestone  sam its okay we can still kill everybody  matt make a nature check  laura were in the north theres a lot of places that snow it could be draconia theres a lot of  places that snow  liam but its delilah briarwood  marisha 19  matt you have no direct idea of where you are but based on the weather that you left whitestone  in not too long ago this isnt whitestone or near whitestone the weather patterns are a little more  classic snow  laura is it winter 
none	 in wildemount right now  matt its the tail end of winter in a few places  liam tower still needs to come down  sam lets go lets move lets attack are we within 500 feet  matt you guys are about now within 500 feet  laura fucking get into the building that we can and then start it  marisha pike and i huddle together and try and join forces  ashley lets do it  marisha lets do it  matt as you guys are holding hands a voice begins to ring out omnipresent directionless  
none	 like its being positioned directly into the minds of each of you from wherever it stands its an  unfamiliar voice the words creep and curl in like theyve always been resting and now is the  moment is for them to reveal themselves  i would ask you to  listen before you make a fool of  yourselves ive watched you since you stepped into my domain and im not going to lie its  been entertaining i admire your gumption it reminds me of others who have tried what you are  trying but theyre dead now 
none	 so i leave the choice to you you can either walk away or you  can join me or you will die and join me anyway  laura eff that shit just do it  liam no one walks away  marisha people dont tell us to stop if theyre not afraid of what were doing  taliesin to the end  laura to the end  sam to the end  taliesin yeah lets just pretend thats not really happening  laura do it  marisha i love you all we do it above the screaming howling horror nights 
none	 sound effects  taliesin i pull silence  matt all right as you guys clasp hands and begin the intricate incantation for the earthquake  spell you can hear the cheers of people on the rooftops theyre standing up now and theyre all  shouting yes yes i hear you you get the sense that perhaps you werent the only ones that  have been spoken to although the conversations may differ from individual to individual as you  guys complete your incantation you watch as the dust begins to rise around the base you see  entropis begin to 
none	 quiver back and forth and you watch as everyone begins to rush to the edge of  the rooftops then rush into the streets to look up their hands raised to the sky not sure what  this means but basking in whatever glory this next sign or omen is to be you watch as a loud  shattering crack sound hits and you watch as one large snaking carving line begins to work its  way up one side of the tower up another and the collective gasp of hundreds of voices across the  city seem to echo 
none	 gasps you watch as one side buckles and the tower begins to slowly rumble  to the ground  sam is it falling towards us  matt its falling not towards you  ashley we thought of that  matt but not the entire tower  taliesin fuck  matt you glance up and watch as the very apex the threeclawed top of the tower is just there  in the sky held aloft unmoving as the rest of the tower seems to have rumble broken away and  as it falls this slow terrifying collapse you hear the rumbling 
none	 of broken stone slamming into  earth as clouds of smoke dust and dead earth are kicked up from the impact of this falling tower  completely enswirling the center of the city with debris and darkness you watch as cultists go  running now their faces filled with fear and confusion at what this suddenly means whats  happening as the dust washes past you it gives this haze over the sky and slowly comes to fade  you all taking in whats happening watch as that one apex of the spire slowly makes its way down to  
none	 the surface of wherever you are on top of the rubble that once stood as entropis  marisha it kind of worked  sam i mean it wasnt bad  marisha it brought it down did anyone of significance die in the process  matt you can only assume  laura can we see who it is  matt youre too far away youre 500 feet away from this  sam lets go  laura lets go  taliesin broom  travis were going up to it or waiting till it comes down all the way  sam oh i 
none	 mean its landing right  matt its landed it settled itself its kind of cocked to one side for it to land in the rubble  its not a perfect platform it rumble and comes to rest at a very faint angle among the ruined  broken jagged obsidian pile its a thousand million flecked arrowheads all jumbled in this  broken glasslike landscape of destroyed tower and there the very zenith of this oncegrand  structure sits resting waiting  taliesin lets do this  sam do we have an escape plan  travis kill everything  marisha i 
none	 can plane shift us if things get really bad but i kind of think  were already on our plane  laura this sounds like were all going to die  sam sure does  ashley all right guys were going to do this were going to do this  liam start walking  taliesin the minute i grab onto your broom you cant hear anything so im just going to ride it  down to the ground and then let go  laura okay  travis well im done playing so im going to take the titan stone knuckles 
none	 and smash them  together and cast enlarge on myself  matt your cloak tears around your body incredible hulk style as your form ruins what  remains of the black sheared fabric that once even by the stretch of the imagination  pseudohid you now  travis a bib remains  matt exactly its almost like one of those chippendale neckpieces what you see is a number  of cultists that were running away from the tower stop and see this and then almost instinctually  go to defend make an intimidation check  travis shouldve raged thats not 
none	 terrible 24  matt and go scattering in other directions you see some are rushing towards the tower to see what  happened to see if anyones okay there are a lot of cultists that were crushed you imagine on  that side of the city especially since they were clustering at the base for whatever this was but  many more are still out in the streets as you guys walk footsteps  making your way towards the central tower  laura i take off the robes get ready slow motion walk towards the tower  matt you make 
town	 your way down the ruined city streets of thar amphala amongst the snowfall  thats now beginning to gather on the tops of your heads and your shoulders and your wings and along  the sides of the street that hadnt seen snowfall probably ever you make your way past the final  boundary buildings the cultists just letting you pass looks of fear looks of excitement looks of  knowing looks of understanding that you probably walk to your deaths and i want to watch this  happen you begin to step over the rubble your footfalls finding the 
none	 grinding highpitched  cracks of broken glasslike obsidian beneath your feet there you look up and can see about 25 or  30 feet of the tower top is resting at an angle you cant see whats up on top of it no windows  how do you wish to proceed  liam were not sneaking up on shit  laura well no they know were here  travis circle flank all together which one  taliesin powerhouses together distance fighters keep their distance  ill take the carpet if its available  laura surround the tower climb up each

none	 a goofylooking beholder goofy voice hi  ashley and marisha hey you guys  matt as you guys arrive the floor is just surrounded in bodies cultists of very ornate  robes mostly youve seen peonbased black splatters of sackcloth what was available  laura theyve been peed on  matt no these are welladorned and appear to have been very wellregarded within the remnants  you also see on this side what appears to be sorry on this side would be delilah briarwood  laura bitchface briarwood  marisha bitchface briarwood  matt on this side you see what 
dung	 appears to be a black armored massive not quite goliathsized  but a thick dark black knight of jagged dark metal armor what appears to be a longsword that  emanates this dark energy and floating above  taliesin oh balls  laura oh no whats flying  ashley put it away  laura no i dont need it  liam those are my platforms i can take them back anytime i want  laura oh no what is that  matt you see a man though the flesh is pulled tight against a skeletal frame you see long red 
none	  and purple and black robes that are tattered and drift below the breeze and cold gently blowing by  you see a field of crackling energy just bursting around the outskirts of his form you see one hand  is out in a welcoming position while the empty wrist that once contained a hand is now open on  the other side you see the bald hairless head which is covered in spots and tugged open bits of  flesh that have curled away from rotten decay you see the cheeks sunken in where the skeletal teeth  are 
none	 now emblazoned in a terrible grin you see the right eye and the gaping hole where a bright  green bursting flaming vacuous void where an eye once was now drifts off a trail behind it you see  there reborn before you the whispered one the undying king vecna himself  travis oh god were in it  taliesin i dont like it being this close  sam well probably all die  matt i would like you all to roll initiative  screaming  travis no  sam matthew mercer may i borrow your monster manual so i

none	 the force of his magical prowess coalesce like a cold vise on your brain and your  body seizes holding taut and youre all held you fall straight down 80 feet  marisha oh no  travis nervous laughter oh fuck oh man  marisha none of us can do anything to help him  laura we slowmotion walked into our own death  travis oh shit  sam is pike out  matt take 32 points of bludgeoning damage vax and you are oh god  laura walls brought down  matt prone there  marisha fucking shit  
none	 matt the rest of you are also held  travis is this charmed or frightened  matt no  travis okay its not  laura what does being held mean  liam its paralysis  taliesin until we save or until his concentration is broken i assume  matt correct  travis and rage would have no effect on this  matt nope  travis fucking shit  matt and hes going to go ahead and shift up about 20 more feet and kind of glance over the  battlefield a bit  sam hes a god hes a golden 
none	 god  travis he actually is one and he wont jump off a 1000foot cliff  matt chuckles apparently all right  laura t minus ten minutes until he turns into a goldfish  marisha we can only be so hopeful  laura thats plenty of time for us to die  matt that ends his turn delilahs now going to go  travis and laura oh good  travis wow what a way to lead off the round  sam my antimagic cone is not in effect i assume  taliesin actually isnt it just naturally wherever theyre looking 
none	  matt its wherever youre facing but he hasnt had a turn to go yet he basically just arrived  taliesin oh okay  matt so it would be kind of in this path here wherever you would have come in in this regard so  it would be this direction  liam its a big fuckin headlamp  sam laughs just frozen there i really want to swallow and i cant close  taliesin i was under the impression that the eyeball was passive  matt im checking right now actually  sam well you have to choose at 
none	 the start of each turn  matt at the start of its turn which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active  sam i havent had a turn  marisha and if its active  taliesin youre holding your action for being able to move  matt anyway  travis hey so laughs  sam we got this guys how many of us are still able to move  matt three of you  sam hey okay  travis looking up things are looking up he has 12 hit points by the way  marisha being held 
none	 whats the deal with that  matt youre paralyzed which means you are incapacitated you automatically fail strength and  dexterity saving throws attack rolls against you have advantage and any creature that hits you  within five feet its a critical hit  travis basically worst scenario possible thats all you had to say worst scenario possible  taliesin it could be worse but it would take math this is bad  sam pikes going to solve everything  ashley oh yeah  sam yeah she can get us out of this  liam flipping those pages  travis 
none	 remember this look boys and girls on matts face as the chef carefully  picks the menu of our yes  laura of our destruction of our doom  taliesin he has been grooming us and fattening us up for two years  matt delilah is going to move  sam oh no lair action she explodes  laughter  matt and is going to step over vaxs body on the ground  marisha oh bitch you better back off bitch  laura hope youre wearing underwear bitch because he just looked up your skirt  matt and looks at 
none	 you  laura small voice me  matt its been a while my dear  yelling  laura no why would you do this how you do dis matt  matt yep so make a constitution saving throw  laura no  matt youre held but you still make a constitution roll  marisha come on  ashley matt how do you do this  travis come on  marisha not again  laura natural 20  cheering  matt no way  liam and i said biiiiitch  matt so you take half as much damage which is good 
none	  marisha oh my god  laura oh im really glad we healed  liam vax on the ground just starts going unintelligible yells  matt all right so instead of 61 points of necrotic damage  you take 30 points of necrotic damage  liam im shaking guys  taliesin leroy  travis oh my god  liam got to squeeze my spiky dice to wake up  laura ow ow  matt you okay  laura whimpering im good  travis blood pressures a thing right now  matt thatll end her turn grog  liam holy shit 
none	 grog  matt your turn happens at the same time the lair action happens  travis and the death knight right  matt and the death knight hes going to go directly after you you guys going on the same  turn i gave you a little bit  taliesin oh man i am not this does not feel good  travis oh shit oh  matt you watch as the bodies on the ground quiver sound of bones cracking  and begin to rise up around you  sam no forget them fix us forget them theyre nothing fix 
none	 us  laura they could just attack us until we die  sam fix us theyre tiny  taliesin i have a plan i have a plan  sam fix us  travis what youre going to pledge your fealty to the fucking  sam some sort of i dont know can you restore restoration  laura do you have mass restoration  ashley no  marisha thats not a spell you guys  ashley im useless  marisha i dont know if pike can fix this  laura i dont think she can fix it  ashley lets use 
none	 it lets just make it matt you can put that in your new campaign book  mass restoration  laura mass antihold  matt and this will be there so they all rise up out of the ground these basic skeletons and they  all get one attack so against percy this one moves in rolls a natural one misses entirely  one of thems going to strike at the beholder thats up in the air thats going to be a 15  whats your armor class  sam 18  matt 18 just ricochets off the armor theres one 
none	 here thats going to go toward pike and  youre not held right you resisted it so its going to go ahead and make a strike on you thats  another 15 just hits your armor and scrapes off no effect this ones going to rush forward two  against vax on the ground it has advantage thats a 19  liam to do what  matt to attack you  liam all right so im at disadvantage but i have advantage so it would be one straight roll  matt no it has advantage against you because youre paralyzed 
none	 so yeah it would be one  straight roll the first roll was 19  liam oh so no  matt no your armor class is 21 naturally  liam it is 21 when the daggers are out and my daggers are in my hands i mean i dont know  this is kinda looseygoosey all right then im at 20  matt yeah so it still misses you the other one no misses both of them just miss you the effect  of the 9thlevel spell is just enough of a vibration that the attacks are being youre  
none	 moving just grunts ever so faintly out of the way  liam familiar  matt one attacking keyleth that is a 24  marisha yeah  matt so you suffer eight points of slashing damage and then vex that is a 12 to hit and a  20 to hit neither hit so as theyre striking you theyre hitting the armor its just not  cutting through they cant seem to get through it so that worked out okay in your favor  laura thanks dragon armor  matt grog youre paralyzed  travis uhhuh  matt i believe you 
none	 make another saving throw at the end of your turn to try  and shrug off the effect  travis can i go into a paralyzed rage  matt nope but make a wisdom saving throw  laura god weve got to roll like a 27 in order to break it  travis 12  matt nope youre still locked in place unable to move  sam i will never be able to break it  laura a 20 didnt break it so yeah  sam yeah theres no way  matt a natural 20 would break it  laura 
none	 a natural 20  marisha a natural 20 would break it thats the only thing  travis i have a modifier of zero so  laura yeah  liam gotta fucking attack that bitch  travis holy shit  matt actually you know what no hes gonna stay back there and move  this way to get out of the way  liam fuck you sylas  matt as the death knight kinda steps over to the side you watch as this small sphere of darkness  begins to crackling sound into his hand and then throws it with an 
none	 arc in a 20foot radius  centered on a point that it chooses  sam thats rough stuff  travis youre a beholder do you get legendary actions and resistances and shit  sam i dont think i dont know  matt its legendary resistances not actions  sam whats a legendary resistance  matt you get to reroll unless it doesnt have it  sam this doesnt  matt no the beholder does not its not that powerful all right i need pike grogits a  dexterity saving throw so grog and scanlan automatically fail percival and pike i

none	 critted on  taliesin yeah i burned a crit  matt you gained the grit back though  taliesin the grits not burned so thats nice these dont double do they  matt no wait technically they would technically they do because it is a crit all  dice double yeah  ashley get him  taliesin does my other rule also apply to this does this add to bleed damage now maybe not  matt i dont think so because its an outside effect  taliesin its an outside factor thats fine im with you  matt no you 
none	 know what it would because just like any other critical effect yes it would  taliesin okay  matt it would  taliesin counting 32 thats 32  marisha did you count that one  taliesin 36 points of damage times two  laura 72  matt 72  taliesin 72 points of electrical damage and then hes also going to get a bleed of 31 no hes  going to get a bleed of 15  matt he will get 15 because hes resistant to lightning so he takes half of that next time  taliesin but he still 
none	 has to roll concentration  matt yeah for 36  taliesin ill take it and goodbye cabal ill gain more when he hits me with some magic shit  sam oh boy  laura its such an anticlimactic fight because none of us can do anything  matt that would be 18 as half that dc is 18 to maintain concentration yeah he saves  taliesin god fucking damn it  matt barely by one  travis by one  matt by one  laura on concentration  taliesin damn it i was debating whether or not to hit him

none	 i can do  matt scanlan go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  sam nope  matt okay  sam i cant move my eyes or anything or turn on my antimagic  matt as far as the ray that you have the eye perspective youre hitting right there so youre  just out of range to get rid of the paralysis from vex and off vax if you manage to break from this  somehow and you rotate the spell would have no effect while its on them  marisha theyre broken from it by being in 
none	 his gaze am i in his gaze  matt no you are not  marisha so i can still cast spells but if i move into his gaze i cannot  matt correct or if you shoot something through the cone it will dissipate  marisha if i shoot up at vecna will it go through the cone  matt yeah probably youre just outside of it  marisha i will not go through the cone  matt probably you can angle it that way yeah keyleth what are you doing  marisha it is now my turn  matt

none	  liam jesus balls  matt youd have to leapfrog over trinket to get there but you can do it  marisha what about delilah where is she  matt delilahs over here she and two skeletons right now are lording over  the paralyzed vax on the ground  marisha if i move at all im going to take opportunity from skeletons  matt yep they dont do a whole lot of damage but damage adds up  marisha jesus okay i am going to head to delilah i can move up to her correct  matt youre going 
none	 to move straight up to her  marisha can i  matt you can yeah both skeletons get attacks of opportunity on you thats a nine and a 12 they  both hit you but the mantle writhes out in front of you you watch as various leaves unfurl almost  like a cats fur on the back of its neck and it deflects the blows  from the skeletons as you rush past  marisha i can give her disadvantage on constitution checks and whenever she takes  damage shes stunned or should i do the confusion thing  
none	 taliesin either one theyre both good go for the first one pick one  marisha im turning into ashley johnson okay  ashley okay  marisha im going to go up to delilah pants cotton mouth oh boy yeah okay im going to go  up to her and be like experience what youve been putting all of us through and im going to touch  her and im going to try and cast contagion on her with mind fire  matt okay  laura mind fire  liam sounds good  taliesin hit her with a mind bullet

none	 mind becomes feverish and she has disadvantage on intelligence checks and  intelligence saving throws and she becomes confused  sam what does that mean what does confused mean  marisha for seven days  liam it sounds like she cant cast spells too well  marisha hopefully  matt shes now considered confused shes under the effects of the confusion spell  for as long as it lasts  taliesin thats me under the effects of being confused about the confusion spell  matt does that end your turn keyleth  taliesin what do you have for a bonus 
none	  marisha i dont have a lot for a bonus i can go into an elemental form  travis if we attack her is that going to drop the confusion  taliesin yeah can we attack her  marisha no it just lasts for seven days  matt it lasts for seven days if she fails the saves she has three saves in a row and if she  succeeds it goes away if she fails it lasts for seven days  marisha okay she has to make constitution saving throws but shes under the effects right now  correct 
none	 weve been through this before havent we  laura oh yeah this is one of the ones we tried a long time ago  marisha it says after failing three of these saving throws the disease effects last for the  duration so that would make me assume that she has it at least for three rounds  matt we had this discussion before because in the ability it has slimy doom which whenever it  takes damage it becomes stunned which is the most broken  marisha i almost did that  matt i know but i think the 
none	 dnd ruling technically they have to  fail three saves before it affects them  marisha but its a 5thlevel fucking spell thats a lot  matt i know  marisha thats lame three rounds for a 5thlevel spell  matt look ill say this ill let mind fire work on her for now  marisha oh he doesnt look happy i feel like i just pissed off the dm  matt no you didnt piss off the dm this spell has a lot of contention in the community but the  official dnd ruling was it doesnt affect until 
none	 they fail all three rolls but as its written it  doesnt say that it says theyre afflicted on being hit so im letting it go through because  you didnt choose the cheesyass stunlock broken spell  marisha it does say that after succeeding on three of these the creature recovers from the disease  so they were already affected  matt which is what im saying this is between whats written in the spell and the arguments that  people have made with dnd on twitter and they clarified thats not how it works its a  mistype 
none	 it wasnt clear im letting it work be happy with the book  laura stop making eye contact look down  matt at the end of your turn vecnas going to use some legendary actions to cast a spell  groaning  travis how about you just say he did and  dont  ashley yeah lets not and say we did  liam he could just evil monologue a little bit tell us his plan  laura hes really good at evil monologuing  taliesin we were talking about how much you wanted a monologue  i really feel

none	 with tremendous might you hear the  crack of thunder as this staggering smite slams into you or tries to at least  sam that sounds bad  taliesin thats bad do you have a reaction  sam i used it already  matt shitty roll 16 to hit  sam oh yeah that hits  matt okay  sam i think im not attuned yeah  matt you take ten points of slashing damage plus 17 points of necrotic damage  taliesin 27  matt and as part of the staggering smite you also take 14 points of psychic 
none	 damage and make a  wisdom saving throw  sam against magic thats better 17  matt 17 his spell dc is 18 unfortunately on a failed save you have a disadvantage on attack  rolls and ability checks and you cant take reactions until the end of your next turn so you  cant counterspell  taliesin scanlans getting whaled on  sam disadvantage on all attack rolls  matt oh but thats a concentration spell so hes not going to maintain the concentration you  take the damage and he lets it go you dont have a disadvantage 
none	 otherwise he would lose other  bits of concentration  laura other bits of concentration  matt all right so that brings us to vex your turn  laura laughing i get to go  matt yeah sorry  sam youre alive  matt sorry guys you walked into the lions den  laura oh yeah we did  liam i never did a single thing in this fight  laura i know this is the first thing ive done i stand up  taliesin if were smart  marisha i can bring you back  taliesin im heading towards

none	 i cant be grappled  taliesin doesnt matter she just gets extra points  marisha oh hes flanked  laura 23 plus eight is 31 right 33 plus 1d6 lightning damage 39 and then 3d6 sneak attack  11 additional so thats  travis 50  laura oh and the blazing bowstring six additional from that  matt 56 points of damage from one shot that is a 23 on his strength save so as the arrow hits you  see the burst of flame it pierces the armor and you see the brambles extend and tear around him  
none	 he looks up at you and you watch as flames fire noises burn out of the armor the arrow burns  away and the brambles ignite and fafll to ash around him  laura not surprising what about his concentration  taliesin come on  matt thats going to be half of 56 oh man hes going to have to roll really high  taliesin and marisha no  matt hold on half of 56 is  sam 28  matt 28 no he rolled a 19 plus five  cheering  matt as the flames ignite and burn around 
none	 the impact still causes him to lose the spell and you  watch as a vacuum fills and grog just as you see this barrage of gloom stalkers ready to grab and  tear you apart you poof out and then whoosh appear in that space where you once were  travis huh  ashley grog youre back  marisha grog weve got to get out  matt all right that ends your turn vex  laura no i get to attack him again  matt go for it  taliesin were in a nice little clump arent we  
none	 laura that one definitely hits this is way less damage 20 damage on the second one  matt all righty you can sense theres shadow and smoke pouring out from under the armor as the  frustration of lost concentration is there the second arrow hits the shoulder staring straight  at you angrily  laura keyleth get us out of here  marisha hold hands  taliesin i think were all in physical contact at this point except for me  matt that ends vexs turn  laura wheres vax  taliesin well  marisha well talk later
