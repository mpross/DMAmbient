none	 before we get to that to give you a little backstory   on the characters youll be seeing this evening   were going to play some videos for you in just a second   but do note for all you hardcore gamers out there   a lot of this is houseruled  kinda looseygoosey having a good time   so all you number crunchers stop paying attention there   just have fun with it   but nevertheless we have some background story   on many of the characters youll be seeing this 
none	 evening   to help you jump into the story   let’s go ahead and enjoy those in just a minute then   well introduce the players so have fun  grog right listen up if you have ale   then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size   this barbarian has an appetite for the two great  loves in his life combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch  wait  easily the brains of the group   grog is often consulted for his 
none	 vast knowledge  of shapes colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his two handed great axe   grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks   of his familys wandering herd   but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods   he objected to the killing such an innocent life  a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this   well this terrified little thing   and his disobedience cost him dearly  weapon crack  beaten bloody and 
none	 banished by the herd leader   his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that   the relative of the very gnome he fought to save   saved him   it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike   that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge   and they have remained close friends ever since   brawling sounds  most nights grog can be found challenging   entire taverns to wrestling matches ha   or accompanying 
none	 scanlan to the nearest house   where you pay for   lady favors   also ale  keyleth a first impression of keyleth would   leave you with little information  on the halfelven druid   you might even think that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet   chuckle  of course it would be unwise underestimate her   based on first impressions  thunder crack  under that unintimidating petite frame is a   vicious beast waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have 
none	 made even the fiercest of   champions pee their pants literally   soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people   keyleth was raised with a deep love  of nature and the elemental magics   it is her people’s inherent duty to protect the   delicate areas in taldorei   where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm   since she was a little girl she had quite a knack   for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities   well if you consider 
none	 kittens and   flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do   clears throat   anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe   her father kohren  realized her true prodigious abilities and   she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and   replaced with endless spell memorization   teachings from ancient traditions   and exceedingly high expectations   every druid leader to be must embark on journey   to seek out the 
none	 sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect   amongst the fellow headmasters   they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path   to truly discovering herself   not knowing when or if she will ever return   as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben   she meditated on the task ahead   part of the aramente is proving yourself   a strong warrior a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader  
none	  with this knowledge one thought plays  in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  percy percy was the third child of 7 children   born to a noble family who lived far to the  north in the ancient castle of whitestone   with so many siblings to share the burdens of   lordship percy turned his attention to the   sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple   named lord and lady briarwood came to court   during a feast held in their honour  
dung	  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle   killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon   only to be freed by his younger sister   together they fled chased by the briarwoods’ men   as they ran percy’s sister took   several arrows to the chest and fell   percy kept running eventually jumping into   a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom   he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat   he barely remembered 
none	 the next two years as he   slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream   a roaring cloud of smoke offered him   vengeance against those who destroyed his family   when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  scanlan oh you haven’t heard of scanlan shorthalt   well gird your loins ladies   because he has his eye on you   a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly   handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs 
none	   almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless   charm and soaring tenor voice to  croon for coin and support his single mother   one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter   and joined dr dranzel’s spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of the world   and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite   come to terms with the violent  death of his mother 
town	 at the hands of a goblin invasion   while his years on the road provided many shall we say   educational experiences with the opposite sex   deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing   he’s never known the true love   of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first   performer second and fighter distant third   on the battlefield he’ll support his allies   but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect   fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh  
town	  a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts   and makes the females swoon  tiberius greetings and salutations   i am tiberius stormwind   i hail from a town called tyrex   located in the heart of draconia   born from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer’s rite   showing prodigylike control of my magic   the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at   how powerful my spells were for how long i 
none	 had been training   at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member   of the magic guild in draconian history for the   next few years i almost went mad from the   malaise of being a guild member   as it’s rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber   unused for quite some time   in the room were stacks of books and maps   of the surrounding cities and areas   around the known world   for months i would frequent the 
none	 chamber and learned   of artifacts from legend   after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts   that caught my eye   i brought these findings to the high council and was told that   all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon   was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries   and hence were lost forever   i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to   convince the city council 
town	 to lend support   in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace   and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms   going from town to town and making friends and allies   in and for the name of draconia   being a red dragonborn   i had quite the task on my hands in that respect   but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore   the world and find these artifacts   as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish 
none	   but i say poppycock to all that   i am much sharper than most give me credit for   i just don’t pay attention to things sometimes   i’ve also been known to be rather cunning loyal   happygolucky and well dangerous   i can’t help but show my true scales every now and then   but overall i think i’m quite friendly for a dragonborn  vax never entirely welcome in the company of   elves or men vaxildan learned   at a young age to skip past formality 
none	   preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia   vax was born by a chance encounter between elven   royalty and human peasantry   raised by their mother in their early years the twins   were eventually sent off to their father   in the elven capital of singorn   but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed   and their time in the capital didn’t last   the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on   the 
town	 open road   after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to   return to their mother and journeyed   back to the lands of their youth   but instead of finding their childhood home   they returned to a pile of rubble   their mother was gone their home burned to ash   pressing the townspeople for answers   they learned of the day the dragon came  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister   set out to find their fortune together in taldorei   
none	 an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve life’s   challenges in his own particular way   often by sidestepping them entirely   and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough   the way of blades the elves schooled him in   more than makes up the difference  vex like so many halfelves   vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering   the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life  
none	  took an interest in their existence   vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan quickly  realized the only people they could truly rely on   in this world were each other  it was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother   and brought to live in singorn   the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador   he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance   and after too many years of disdainful looks   the pair decided to 
none	 leave his indifference behind   and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and   learning the ways of the thief   while vex kept to the woods   she preferred the isolation   always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track   to spy and to shoot   and through a series of fateful events   earned herself a companion in the form of a bear    her own stolen trinket    to fight alongside her and 
none	 protect her fiercely   also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt all right hey guys welcome back  so to give you a little heads up   we are playing the 5th edition of dungeons and dragons   we recently converted over from pathfinder   for those who play pathfinder  and one of our players was a gunslinger for which there are   no rules for in 5th edition  so i had to create and customize those   for the game so bear with us on that   
none	 that will be an interesting ride regardless  we do have an 8 player game we’ve been playing for two years   which is a little crazy   which is why we go a little loose with the rules   but its a great group   its a lot of fun and not everyone can make every game   so we have enough players to definitely pull a party each time  zac off screen just so you know were having an audio bottleneck   itll take about 30 seconds to work itself out

none	 did not have a chance   to really enjoy it immediately   as one of their good friends and allies  arcanist allura vysoren of the taldorei council   came to them requesting their aid saying that   a long time friend of hers lady kima of vord   who is a very well known and very well respected   halfling paladin of bahamut the platinum dragon   had been gone on a pilgrimage for a while   essentially a vision quest that is part   of her own development as 
dung	 a paladin   as part of this she let the information go to allura   that a dark vision had come to her   saying that some sort of evil root is   beginning to breed beneath kraghammer and the mountains within  kraghammer which is the nearby dwarven civilization   that you guys have previously not been allowed entry to   ‘cause the dwarves werent fans of nobody   without any political means of entry   however she managed to acquire the necessary documentation   and offered you a very 
none	 substantial reward   should you find the whereabouts of lady kima of vord   and hopefully bring her back safely   you left on the pathway to the dwarven citadel of kraghammer   you were ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian goliaths  of which partway through the battle   grog managed to recognize one of them as a previous ally   and no longer an ally at this time  travis son of a bitch  matt yep the barbarian for his first and only time so far   managed to 
none	 avert battle through a social encounter   and rolled pretty damn well on a persuasion check   so you got one you get one  you got your one never again  travis next time he dies  matt yeah essentially  all laugh  matt but you managed to not turn it into complete bloodshed   and you continued on your way to kraghammer   presented your paperwork were given entry into the city   and that is where we begin this adventure  laura oh no  sam in the city of kraghammer

dung	 that leads into the main   central portion of the city proper   an enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you   the dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone work   marble columns archways and labyrinthine bridges   climbing across the vertical cityscape  all warmed within the red glow of some strange   crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source  a large metal forge envelops the center of this cylindrical city   the entire is a three tiered cylindrical city that is built   into the 
none	 ground of the mountain itself   welcome to kraghammer  liam remind us did we bullshit our way in here or did   laura no we had a way in  matt no allura got your paperwork   because you were unable to get in this time  laura but ashley speaks dwarven pike speaks  matt pike pike speaks dwarvish  laura and shes not  matt and shes not here  tiberius ii speak dwarvish as well  vexalia oh good  tiberius i do  scanlan thats fantastic  keyleth where’d you learn that 
dung	  tiberius from books  matt the only other bit of information you have   about the whereabouts of her   is that she came here to go into the mine   apparently a mithril mine where this evil is supposedly brewing   you heard that the one person who owns   the biggest part of the mithril market  here kind of cornering it name was   the dwarven lord nostoc greyspine   that was the only name you had in regards   to this deep earth quarry  sam greyspine

none	 that have a uniform scar carved across the front  it’s actually built into the armor itself as a design   and theyre both just staring awkwardly at all of you   arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of kraghammer  vax’ildan tiberius make with the dwarftalk please  tiberius uhm hello friends  my associates and i were looking for a place of lodging   for the night and a place of reputable… reputation  matt one dwarf kind of shouts over to another one   guard 1 you hear that jepson

none	 no no not at all  grog that sounds fine with me  liam this is common  matt this is all in common yeah  scanlan which way to the pig pits sir  jepson pig pits are that way  matt and he points over the edge and you see down past  the central forge structure in the city at the very   very bottom nearby what looks like a large   temple that envelops the larger    or the bottom floor of kraghammer proper there is indeed   a distant slop 
tavern	 of mud where internal livestock are being kept  laura i bring out a piece of gold   vex please sir were looking for a place to stay   that isnt covered in mud  jepson well it’s good to see that at least   one of you speaks dwarvish  all laugh  matt takes the coin kinks it in his teeth and goes   jepson all right now if youre looking for a proper place to stay   youre gonna look for the iron hearth tavern   that is just to your 
tavern	 left up that way no more than a half mile   keep an eye out   listen for the laughter and the people who are   very very drunk   thats your best bet  vex thank you sir  jepson no worries  vex i like your armor by the way  guard well thank you kindly  travis was that a wink  laura it was  all laugh  liam that’s all she does  vex thats all i do i wink at people  liam it’s a nervous tick really  matt 
tavern	 it’s a feat she took  all laugh  matt you progress to the western side of the kraghammer rotation   as you kind of curl around the central platform   making your way eventually to the outside of this rather large   central tavern inn   as you walk in you can hear music playing   you can hear laughter and boastful cheer   you can hear some arguments in the distance   you can hear it form a good two or three buildings away   this is definitely a central 
tavern	 social environment here in kraghammer   as you walk inside you   let me get some proper tavern music here for you  scanlan smells in here  grog drinking territory   matt you hear some loud boisterous   hearty dwarven laughter   some drinks being clinked together   as you walk in the first thing that catches you   is the scent of stale alcohol and the scent   of smoked wood of some kind   grog yes  matt there are tables most of them in decent condition  
tavern	  some of them half broken and repaired   probably from some previous encounter in the bar   in the center of the room there looks to be a not currently in use   specifically built brawling circle   it’s about maybe it’s about thirty feet by twenty feet   it’s more of an oval it’s not in use currently   sam an octagon   matt essentially   liam how high is the ceiling here can grog fit in here  matt laughs  laura i was thinking the same thing  
none	 travis laughing oh right am i like   matt the ceiling actually is considered vaulted ceiling   for dwarves so it runs at about seven feet   for grog it’s an uncomfortable   like almost scratching your head across the top  liam just enough  grog bitch   fuck  matt and as you enter about seven or eight of the   nearby dwarves at the front door go  dwarves hearty laughter   laughter stops  matt they just look immediately at the ragtag   nondwarven group that just kind

town	 some standalone homes that   are built out of fine stone   you eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it   where you start seeing some of the more marble buildings   some of the more exotic stonework being used in the construction   of the homes   you also notice three of the guards that are part of the   city establishment there are following you   from behind curiously   the carvers  vex oh shit the carvers shit  matt no weapons drawn but definitely

none	 very tight braid   that goes down to his belly button   all wearing the same basic chest plate   long black kindof velvet cloak behind   each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer   around the side of their belt steps up and says  guard well just to tell you the rules here   if you’re gonna go ahead and wander at night   in a very expensive district you dont wanna do it  by yourself because you either have chances of being mugged  or arrested we might have

none	 are like   “oh im not talking to you   some others are like oh yeah right over that way”   and its a completely wrong direction so it takes you   a good two hours to eventually find your way to house thunderbrand   when you get there its a beautiful   beautiful alabaster building   large white dome with small spires   built in to one of the more elevated   ceilings of kraghammer proper   you can see on the outside   there is no gate 
none	 just an open lawn   you see grass you see what looks   like normally outside flora and fauna currently   adorning the scape around this structure  tiberius woah well this is a lovely sight  orion im gonna saunter on up to the door  matt nice go ahead and make a perception check  orion where is my perception oh five  matt five you saunter right up to the edge of the grass line  and get one step on what suddenly becomes visible to you  a rather subtly carved dwarven rune 
none	 in the ground  in fact theres a bunch of them   outlining the entirety of the grass  matt as your foot hits the rune youre like  matt as tiberius oh thats a dwarven rune  stomp noise  sam thats a good voice  all laugh  matt as tiberius ive been practicing my tiberius  orion its close  matt laughs go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw  travis uhoh saving throw  laura you got it you got it you got it tiberius  orion whaum what is this  marisha dexterity 
none	  orion oh thats a fifteen  matt fifteen  orion mmm hmm  matt all right you manage to pull back to lessen the impact  but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out   from the rune in front of you  throwing you about three or four feet behind the rune   you catch yourself  you do suffer eight points of thunder damage  orion okay  marisha damn gated communities  matt laura and travis chuckle  sam this is why we go to brothels   instead of sneaking around at night 
none	  travis yup no lightning attacks  matt its a whole different kind of damage you can suffer  orion okay well i dust myself off   tiberius apparently there’s some security  hello  orion anything happen  matt you wait about two or three minutes no response  orion two to three minutes thats a long time  matt yeah  marisha i have a feeling theyre not gonna respond to the crazy guy  tiberius very well  travis whatre you two doing  percy and keyleth were making comment cards yes  percy youre all 
tavern	 going to have comment cards   that you are expected to fill out when you return back to the bar  sam hugely important hugely important  marisha yes cause  what was it baldus beldus  sam balgus  travis ballsack  marisha balan balan was so nice  matt there we go balgus and balan  orion do i see  what do i see around the place   do i see any large rocks or any large pillars that i can  matt best from what you can tell at this distance   because 
dung	 its fairly dark down here   you can see that the building itself just has   four corner spires around the large central dome structure   each one of these spires is a very very thin   tall alabaster spire that at the very top   is crested with some sort of bluish crystal that comes to a point   theyre probably a good 35 40 feet tall   about as tall as the rest of the structure is   orion okay  matt you cant really tell how far back the 
dung	 structure goes because   again it meets with the back of the cave wall  orion im going to… okay im gonna shoot a fireball   just… right in front of me kind of like…   roll it like a bowling ball   just right to the door  matt okay  orion there is a baby right there   matt you are 4 feet from the door   orion oh im 4 feet from the door  orion i dont do that i dont do that  laughter  matt you can step

none	 that fireball dude  marisha you cant be left alone dammit  matt everyone is level 9 currently in the game  orion i use… mage hand and i knock on the door  matt from that far away okay the mage hand creates   the arcane energy swirls up and forms this   loosely handlike appendage that drifts foward   as soon as it crosses over the rune where you stepped on   there is a spark of energy and the hand is dispelled   tiberius damn these runes okay fine   i 
none	 will do glacial blast right up to the door   matt okay  orion but not to the door  marisha what  sam you’re alone  matt okay so as you cast the glacial blast forward   the ice begins to congeal across the bottom of the floor   as it reaches the front of the rune   there is another spark of energy   and the ice forms up against an invisible barrier   thats there and then the ice thats up against the barrier   melts extremely quickly drifting into 
none	 a puddle of water   orion shit i turn back and head to the group  matt okay as you turn around there are four carvers   that are hurrying towards you now   with their hammers out going  carver “you you”  tiberius what   matt they all surround you on all sides   you have a dwarf on each corner  carver you have attacked one of the great   dwarven families of kraghammer  name yourself and your business before you are under arrest  tiberius dont speak to me 
none	 in that manner   i am tiberius stormwind  sam i am snoring after having sex   all laugh  matt make intimidation check   orion 18   laura gasps  matt all four carvers take a step back look at each other  carver look were just doing our job whats your business  tiberius i understand that and i am sorry for losing my temper   but i was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts   i have been looking for and this house is the only known   
tavern	 arcane house i know that i was pointed to   i tried to reach them and communicate but i was stopped  by the stupid rune i cant figure out   so i was turning back to get my tavern to   get some rest and you know come back and try to contact  the family the next day and then i was stopped by you  matt make a persuasion check  orion 24  liam ive just arrived to new york city   im going to smash the doors open   all 
none	 laugh  matt the dwarf guards look at each other and he goes    one of them steps forward and this guy you can see now  he has more carvings in his armor   he looks to have a little more rank than the other ones   he steps forward ruddy brown beard his eyes itself   are pitch black there is almost no color to the irises  and he goes  carver 2 look im letting you off this once   but if you so much as spit in the direction 
dung	   of any other dwarf in the city   were going to bury you so far underneath the dungeon   you wont see the light of day til the day you rot   you hear me dragonborn  tiberius i mean yes my hearing is perfectly fine   all laugh  matt kind of like “get on with you”   he puts his hammer back at his side   they all separate stare you down as you walk past   tiberius good day   all laugh  orion back to the

tavern	 visible to some carver   this area is pretty well guarded  you figure largely because the person who is   currently the ironkeeper of the entire city of kraghammer l  ives with that building as well as   one of the more powerful dwarven families   so its pretty well watched  vax okay im just going to head back to the inn then  matt okay  vax im not going to poke the bear  matt you all eventually gather back at the tavern  scanlan exhausted sigh how was your night

none	 leader   his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that   the relative of the very gnome he fought to save   saved him   it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike   that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge   and they have remained close friends ever since   brawling sounds  most nights grog can be found challenging   entire taverns to wrestling matches ha   or accompanying scanlan to the nearest

none	 of   champions pee their pants literally   soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people   keyleth was raised with a deep love  of nature and the elemental magics   it is her people’s inherent duty to protect the   delicate areas in taldorei   where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm   since she was a little girl she had quite a knack   for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities   well if you consider kittens and   
none	 flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do   clears throat   anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe   her father kohren  realized her true prodigious abilities and   she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and   replaced with endless spell memorization   teachings from ancient traditions   and exceedingly high expectations   every druid leader to be must embark on journey   to seek out the sister tribes  in 
none	 order to introduce and establish respect   amongst the fellow headmasters   they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path   to truly discovering herself   not knowing when or if she will ever return   as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben   she meditated on the task ahead   part of the aramente is proving yourself   a strong warrior a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader   with this knowledge 
none	 one thought plays  in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  percy percy was the third child of 7 children   born to a noble family who lived far to the  north in the ancient castle of whitestone   with so many siblings to share the burdens of   lordship percy turned his attention to the   sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple   named lord and lady briarwood came to court   during a feast held in their honour   the briarwoods violently 
dung	 took control of the castle   killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon   only to be freed by his younger sister   together they fled chased by the briarwoods’ men   as they ran percy’s sister took   several arrows to the chest and fell   percy kept running eventually jumping into   a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom   he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat   he barely remembered the next two years 
none	 as he   slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream   a roaring cloud of smoke offered him   vengeance against those who destroyed his family   when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  scanlan oh you haven’t heard of scanlan shorthalt   well gird your loins ladies   because he has his eye on you   a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly   handsome in his own mind scanlan sings songs   almost as 
none	 much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless   charm and soaring tenor voice to  croon for coin and support his single mother   one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter   and joined dr dranzel’s spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of the world   and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite   come to terms with the violent  death of his mother at the hands of 
town	 a goblin invasion   while his years on the road provided many shall we say   educational experiences with the opposite sex   deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing   he’s never known the true love   of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first   performer second and fighter distant third   on the battlefield he’ll support his allies   but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect   fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh   a rollicking song 
town	 and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts   and makes the females swoon  tiberius greetings and salutations   i am tiberius stormwind   i hail from a town called tyrex   located in the heart of draconia   born from a politically respected family  at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerer’s rite   showing prodigylike control of my magic   the judges and the draconian high council were amazed at   how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training  
none	  at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member   of the magic guild in draconian history for the   next few years i almost went mad from the   malaise of being a guild member   as it’s rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber   unused for quite some time   in the room were stacks of books and maps   of the surrounding cities and areas   around the known world   for months i would frequent the chamber and learned  
none	  of artifacts from legend   after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts   that caught my eye   i brought these findings to the high council and was told that   all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon   was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries   and hence were lost forever   i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse and managed to   convince the city council to lend support  
town	  in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace   and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms   going from town to town and making friends and allies   in and for the name of draconia   being a red dragonborn   i had quite the task on my hands in that respect   but it was exactly what i needed so i could explore   the world and find these artifacts   as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish   but i 
none	 say poppycock to all that   i am much sharper than most give me credit for   i just don’t pay attention to things sometimes   i’ve also been known to be rather cunning loyal   happygolucky and well dangerous   i can’t help but show my true scales every now and then   but overall i think i’m quite friendly for a dragonborn  vax never entirely welcome in the company of   elves or men vaxildan learned   at a young age to skip past formality   preferring instead 
town	 to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia   vax was born by a chance encounter between elven   royalty and human peasantry   raised by their mother in their early years the twins   were eventually sent off to their father   in the elven capital of singorn   but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed   and their time in the capital didn’t last   the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on   the open road   
none	 after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to   return to their mother and journeyed   back to the lands of their youth   but instead of finding their childhood home   they returned to a pile of rubble   their mother was gone their home burned to ash   pressing the townspeople for answers   they learned of the day the dragon came  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister   set out to find their fortune together in taldorei   an outsider since birth 
none	 vax quickly learned to solve life’s   challenges in his own particular way   often by sidestepping them entirely   and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough   the way of blades the elves schooled him in   more than makes up the difference  vex like so many halfelves   vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering   the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father who only later in life   took an interest 
none	 in their existence   vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan quickly  realized the only people they could truly rely on   in this world were each other  it was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother   and brought to live in singorn   the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador   he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance   and after too many years of disdainful looks   the pair decided to leave his indifference behind 
none	   and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and   learning the ways of the thief   while vex kept to the woods   she preferred the isolation   always the keen observer she learned to hunt and to track   to spy and to shoot   and through a series of fateful events   earned herself a companion in the form of a bear    her own stolen trinket    to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  
none	  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt hello everyone welcome back   weve had our pee breaks  weve had our refills of our drinks  we’ve got fireball so i think were good for the next venture   so anyway the party has taken their rest for the evening   once again this is one of those weird experiences   where you wake up not because of the sun rising   because you cant see it in the dwarven city of kraghammer   but eventually you all come to

none	 iron keeper is not open to business   outside of preapproved political understandings   vex of course  margrim if you dont have a preapproved   meeting put within our ledger you wont be seen  vex of course not but for the mining contracts however   wouldnt we need to speak to nostoc is there any way   i hear its very hard to get down into the mines  its very wellguarded right   thats why we came to speak to him here   matt he leans over and looks at 
town	 the cask of ale and says  margrim down to the mines   you just have to go to one of the chain platform posts   at the edge of town that will bring you to the base area   find your way to the mines there   that should be enough to get nostoc’s attention   the rest is up to you  vex lovely thank you so much  scanlan one moment before we adjourn  whispers do we want to try to get into this place   or are we just 
none	 going to go to the mines  laura whispers maybe we should just talk to nostoc first  scanlan and ditch this place  percy every time we break into someones house it turns out poorly  vex were trying to get to the mines essentially so  vax i think hes still listening  percy good man good day  vex margrim youve been wonderful thank you so much   we plan on keeping some of this ale and   bringing it back to the household   would you like some when we open the cask 
none	  matt he looks down at the cask looks up at you and says  margrim i would not turn it down a sip or two  vex lovely well be sure to save you a small bottle  sam im going to turn invisible  matt as hes looking over there you just vanish   all right  marisha you can do that  sam and im sneaking into the house  taliesin oh god  liam to what end  travis thats awesome who cares light it up  sam i dont know why  travis hes 
dung	 gone nuts  margrim is that all your business  vex i believe it is all of our business  margrim well good day  matt and he steps back into the doorway and   closes the large oak doors  you are now standing in the foyer of palace greyspine   a luxurious foyer the floor itself is   a fine dark velvet red carpet   there are tapestries across the walls   and small wooden end tables set at the edges   of the hallway this foyer area   that contains 
none	 sculptures and   vases and plants that exist underground specifically   theres a large stairway that leads up   into the upper portion of the house   and two doors at each side that lead to rooms   you no longer can see   orion i use the earpiece and whisper  tiberius what are you doing scanlan   what are you doing  scanlan i dont know give me twenty minutes  vex twenty minutes thats okay   lets all step away from the house   keyleth ask if he 
none	 needs assistance or divergent   taliesin divergent  marisha divergent  matt so margrim of course wipes his hands and walks away going  margrim ah fucking foreigners  sam i follow him where hes going   matt okay  sam my nervousness i let out a little bit of a fart as we   all laugh  matt make a stealth check   orion why are you making it harder on yourself  sam 14 plus im invisible plus 2 16   matt because youre invisible   ill give you advantage on that 
none	   go ahead and roll  sam oh well 14 plus 2 16   matt all right   so as you scamper by behind margrim following him   towards what looks like the kitchen area of the abode   margrim stops and turns rubs his stomach goes umf   and continues walking forward   seemingly unperturbed by the sound  sam im just snooping around   trying to see if theres any lords  or higher ranking individuals in the area  matt okay ill say with the time that you have 
none	   within the house you wander through quite a few rooms   theres a wonderful music room which contains   a number of dwarven instruments that youve read of   and many instruments that you know as well   you actually find another   what do you call it again a shawm  sam shawm  matt a shawm you find another shawm within   more finely crafted than the one that you have   sam oh fuck  matt a gift of lords if you will  sam im so tempted 
none	 but no  matt okay  laura does he have an earring on   does he have one of our earrings  liam we all do  matt not everyone you only made a few  sam just just me and him  sam he can talk to me apparently  vex tiberius tell him to look for paperwork of something   for the mines  tiberius scanlan look for paperwork of something else   and by the way   all of you should be hearing me right now you all have the ear  matt 
none	 not everyone you only have a few  laura you only made like 5 or something  matt you could only afford 5  tiberius clears throat do all those things scanlan  scanlan great  grog whos talking right now  matt as you look about the household   you also come across a couple of   bed chambers that are locked pretty hefty lock  sam i can try  matt okay you make your way up the stairway   and you can see theres a long hall that leads to   essentially a 
dung	 throne room that is   still partially under construction mostly finished   and you can see it it actually was an   intentional build onto this house   house greyspine when the current ironkeeper   went into office it seems began to have this room built   and so its nearly finished but its an extravagant room   with a large stone and dark metal throne   steps lead up to it and its raised daislike   pedestal in the center of the room   you can see a series 
none	 of great magically glowing and flickering   lanterns across them   and you see there are two dwarves inside   that are currently finishing up the stone work   theyre just doing various sorts of masonry   and plastering in areas and carving out   and chiselling out pieces of stone   and making them intricately carved in this flavour   but other than that the room is currently empty  sam shit theres nothing to steal  travis drop a deuce in the bedroom  all laugh  matt gnomishdeuce  
none	 tiberius dammit scanlan just get out of there   what are you doing  laura you totally should  travis an invisible poo  laura invisible poo  sam i’m ah i might as well try one of the doors thats locked   and see if i can pick it but im not good at that so ill try  matt okay do you have on your person any sort of thieves tools  sam i have a forgery kit a poisoners kit  marisha forge some thieves tools real quick  sam climbing gear  and a 
none	 whip  liam i have one of the earrings and i say  vax scanlan what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade   and will it be ending shortly  sam can i reply  matt you can through the messagebased ear enchantment   scanlan just trust me that i have no idea what im doing  all laugh  matt so do you wish to pick one of the doors  travis do it  laura do it try it and then run away  sam yeah im gonna try one  matt okay you 
none	 have disadvantage on this  sam of course i do  travis i love how were just watching this happen  vax pike will mourn your death   matt so roll twice and well consider this a   well say just a straight dexterity check  sam eleven plus… zero  matt you futz with the door for a good minute   trying to bend a piece of wire you had   thinking to forge some tumblers   and eventually get to a point where you hear   tink  and it broke  
none	 all laugh  sam i cant do two spells at once   so i will give it give it up and ill make my way to the door  matt okay the door is currently closed  sam i become uninvisible and i cast dimension door   matt all right   matt you whoosh blink through this small   purplish arcane doorway  it brings you directly outside   you guys are waiting scanlan just pops into view ‘ah’  scanlan it was crazy in there   people were farting everywhere  all laugh 
none	  tiberius really scanlan   scanlan it was not me theyre building a throne room   there were some locked doors man i wish you could have been there   it was exciting but ultimately pointless   so lets go down to the mines  all laugh  vax i would like to stress again that   none of these dwarves are our enemies at all  vex soon im sure  vax we just want to go have some words with greyspine  grog and that we do not have our healer at present 
tavern	  vax well we do but shes very distracted   and is not feeling herself  vex shes very quiet  scanlan she wanted to stay at the inn this morning  vax shes feeling awfully bafta today so  all laugh  scanlan lets make our way to the mines shall we  grog to the mines then yeah  laura yes  vax lets go get this drunk dwarf  matt yes the bard was doing a lockpick with no lockpicks   he was fashioning it from wire  exciting but pointless all right   
none	 so you you make your way to the edge of the centre ring   you find that there are long spiral staircases that move   to the bottom where there are elevators   that bring you to the bottom floor   the elevators are chain based like a ratchettype system   with two carvers there of course  as you approach one eventually you talk with them   they lead you down there but once again they give you   a look of “watch your back”  laura we point at the ale 
none	 and give him a thumbs up  matt they nod and let you pass   as you continue downward into the lower area   you can see the red stone that lets a lot  of the atmospheric glow of kraghammer is used less and less   and a lot more central torches are now in place sconces   almost like the stone itself is either just rarer   the further down you go or has less of an illuminating power   the deeper into the earth   laura whispering okay now im 
town	 nervous  matt you eventually reach into the center part of town   you now see from where you are standing a number of large structures   in the very very center of the bottom part   of the city of kraghammer   you can see there is a giant domed temple   that is made of like gold and bronze in the center   it looks almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has   doorways on each side that is currently closed off   no guards at it though   
town	 you do see a number of other buildings   there is a large large heavy heavy looking foundry   far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke   thats coming off of it but most   of it looks to be filtered into a giant metallic funnel   that is then placed into the rock   almost like all the smoke based exhaust is being funneled   outside of the mountain   that is the closest thats the foundry   and then to the right 
dung	 of you you wander a bit   and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside   to the far right has that look of a strip mine   or like a large portion of the minerals has been pulled away   and is currently being mined further   so that looks like probably   one of the better places to look in looking for the greyspine quarry   you eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry   you now look down into three large pits that 
dung	 just descend   deeply into the side of the mountain   this mine has been going for quite   some time and a large chunk of this looks like   it may be being prepped   almost like the mine is whats growing kraghammer   the more they mine into the mountain   the more they fill the mined area   with further city construction   its this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city downward   currently in the quarry  you can see there are a number of 
town	 large stone dwarven buildings   in the edge of it one of which is the largest of them all   looks like its made more of a black and red iron aesthetic   some of its been oxidized a little bit and has that rough   and tumble iron feel   and that one has the most guards around the base of it  the carvers are gathered entirely around it   matt looking down into the center of the quarry you can see   towards the bottom there are a number of 
none	 tunnels that lead into   the hillside of cliffkeep mountains proper surrounding kraghammer  grog lets go where the guards are  vex lets walk towards the guards  vax lets just do this directly i think  scanlan just swords out  keyleth wait wait wait before we go up i take the cask of ale   and i grow some pretty flowers on it and i make a nice pretty   bow and i shine it up a little  vax good work hippy  percy youre making a fruit basket  keyleth no i’m 
none	 just  it looks attractive now   percy like a fruit basket it looks like a fruit basket  keyleth it does not look like a fruit basket   its not that ostentatious   percy its the ale of the month club  vax in her defense they probably dont see flowers too often   its a nice touch  percy that is very fair  orion im going to take this opportunity to cast stoneskin on myself  matt okay stoneskin is placed on you  sam are you a dwarf still  taliesin are 
none	 you a dwarf made of stone  matt you have not turned alter self off   you are still a dwarf  orion yeah thats fine  matt oh stoneskin is a concentration spell so yes   that would eliminate the alter self spell  okay so you revert back to your dragon form robed self   but stoneskin is in effect  matt you using your whats it called again  marisha druidcraft its really creative  matt druidcraft thank you   the prestidigitation for hippies  portions of the wood begin to sprout from 
dung	 the outside of this dark   wood barrel and form these entangled ivy vines that eventually   embrace the entirety of this cask with little buds of dark   ruddy flowers   something that would definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic  marisha thats hot  matt you approach the guards of which there are   eight currently at the front  laura can i see which one of them use my perception to see   which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest   matt would be more of 
none	 an insight  laura insight which one of them looks most interested in our party  matt yeah go ahead and roll  laura oh good i thought that was a 1 but its not   it was a 13  matt 13 okay strangely enough they are fairly   distracted and after a rather long  uneventful morning most of them are just used to being in armor   and waiting for business to go down   there are a few along the edges that look a little more alert   and one of 
none	 them is looking occasionally down into the quarry   just keeping an eye on the established area  laura which one looks like the newest  matt the newest of the bunch would be the one   thats on the far left that is looking down into the quarry as well   he has a shaved head has a small brownish beard   that looks like hes just starting to grow out   into a nice long tuft   either it got shaved in some i dont know   terrible college dwarf accident 
none	  you know part of his entry into some fraternity  grog dwarf culture dwarf sigma sigma  matt its a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown beard   that goes about that far out   its just starting to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids   its not quite there and he probably gets a lot of shit for it   from the other dwarves   but he seems to generally be looking at you guys  vax okay work your magic  grog yeah do your thing… fuck these dwarves up 
none	  vex no well i was just  i just wanted to know   scanlan what are we trying to do  vex we brought this gift um hello  and we just address all of them maybe right now yeah  percy she is better at this   i am just going to let her do this  vex and scanlan hello hi  tiberius greetings and salutations  matt the other guards reach back and grab their weapons   one of them looking to you  tiberius oh you dont need that  vex i 
none	 look over at the shavedhead one   and i hold his gaze for a little bit  vax i give vex a little push forward  dwarven guard all right whats your business  vex oh yes well we are here to speak with nostoc   we brought a gift for him thats quite remarkable actually  matt they curl up around the apparent barrel that grogs holding   they look wary of grog but once they make note   of the barrel they all    guards ooooh    grog right it’s 
none	 the shit  all laugh  dwarven guard i’ve heard of this   but i have not seen anyone actually drink it   there were long standing rumours that this even existed  vex it exists  scanlan and its for nostoc  dwarven guard this is a balgus original  vex yes  dwarven guard signed by himself i see on the burned emblazoned wood  ill go talk to him  matt and he heads inside of the building   the doors close behind him   the other guards encroach keeping a very keen 
none	 eye   each one having a bead on the rest of your group   about two minutes pass before he comes back   opens the door and goes  dwarven guard nostoc will see you briefly   but you best bring the gift   i think thats whats holding his interest  vex of course  tiberius wonderful  dwarven guard inside please  matt and him and one other guard flank you guys as you enter   making sure that you are not left without that appearance   as you are led 
none	 into the center of this portion   of the mines main structure  a series of long hallways you can see there is this general smell   of soot and ash and broken stone dust in the air   a hint of brimstoneish kind of a smell   its not very pleasant its very well worn and pungent   for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface  as you enter there is a general dust in the air   a little light seems to peek through from the 
dung	 torches   that are placed up along the wall   you can see this general haze amongst the interior here   it is definitely a work environment at the base of an underground   dwarven establishment used to mine  you are led further down the hallway   it curves to the left and you are brought   into a large dwarven study   you can see there are books on the walls   a series of ledgers and paper stacks   on a large desk and at the center  
dung	  there sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short   almost like a buzzcut on the top   with a long long long beard that is not braided   but just kept very smooth and very… not curly not bunched   its a very straight beard   he is very clean cut he already has this   intimidating dark glare   as you walk into the room he goes  nostoc greyspine okay you brought me a drink   you have my attention   what brings you to 
dung	 the mines  scanlan we should have talked this through before  percy well several things actually   several things bring us to the mine   my name of course is   percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  everyone you can call him percy  matt he raises his finger and goes  nostoc you have not paid for your pleasantries yet  vex oh of course of course grog if you would  liam tap that motherfucker  travis i am assuming he had a goblet on the table  matt as you 
none	 pour it up he pulls under his desk   and pulls up a goblet   as you fill it   nostoc top it off thank you   now put on the side of the desk  scanlan wait mister greyspine    oh okay all right  matt puts it down  nostoc satisfied sigh  vex is it as amazing as weve heard  nostoc its pretty fucking good  matt he takes another long drag just    while making sure you all watch him do this   this goes on 
tavern	 probably a little longer the pageantry   of him drinking this in front of you is definitely a power play   and he is establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room   eventually he finishes his tankard   sets it down under the desk again  nostoc right… so where were we  percy we were here to call upon your expertise   we imagine that we are not the first strangers to   kraghammer to come through   vex   in the last few weeks   percy  
none	 in the last few weeks   we believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you   perhaps not as… pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have  scanlan a lady in fact  vex a halfling  matt at which point as you say that   he gets this grin to his face and goes  nostoc aye i know of the one you speak  vex yes  nostoc she is a strongheaded one that one  percy yes  nostoc she stepped on a few toes around this place  tiberius 
none	 oh is she clumsy  nostoc one could say that aye   you say you are compatriots of hers  percy we are here to mend any broken bridges so to speak  keyleth or broken toes if you will  nostoc she certainly left a mess in her wake   theres this strange vision quest she kept talking about   it brought her into atmospheres…   portions of this city portions of my business   that she has no right trespassing on   she went against carver rules   she broke away 
none	 from partial arrest   and she went screaming down into the caverns of our mines   without my permission blade drawn   on some crazed suicide mission  vex you know what well go after her   well bring her out   well get her out of your mines  nostoc great id like that actually  vex good  percy and wed be happy to clear out anything unpleasant   that we happen to find in there in the meantime  tiberius how did she look  grog what  nostoc she looked 
none	 small and angry   she seemed to have some weight to her   she was a strong lass  tiberius so not a looker is what you are saying  keyleth thats not very nice  matt and he gives you this strange look and goes  nostoc i will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling  sam the dwarf is a feminist  vex how much would this task be worth to you   obviously we are doing you quite a favour   and we brought you quite a gift  scanlan this 
none	 cost us a thousand gold  tiberius quietly to scanlan did it  nostoc obviously this lass means a lot to you doesnt she  vex no no no but i know she is probably   wreaking havoc on your mines  vax weve come to correct the wrongs   that shes done and come to bring her home  keyleth it also sounds like there are some other   terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines  nostoc there is nothing going on were fine   we have everything under control   we dont 
none	 need your help for that   if you want to find your friend   go find her if she is still alive  if not take her corpse back and leave  percy its not help sir   we are simply respecting you as a businessman   and as a businessman i am sure   that you would disagree with unceremonious charity   whether it would be to give it or receive it   we are making sure that our dealings with you   are fair and balanced  nostoc i appreciate 
dung	 your offering   you have bought your time   now if you are here to go find your friend i’ll let you pass   you may pass into the mine  but  if at any moment you cross over   to any sort of thieving bullshite   matt looks over at you  nostoc  i recommend that you fall down the same path   your friend likely did and get killed real quick   i dont take kindly to those who cross on my business  percy i doubt that we 
none	 could find anything of more value   that what we have already brought you  vax we are here to right wrongs and i promise you   our business is finding her and returning home  nostoc then go  vexahlia is that our business  grog yeah we are here to right wrongs and right lefts  percy and write comment cards  marisha wait before we dive into this mountain    we know that theres ghouls and god knows what else down there   shouldnt we find out  tiberius yes we should 
none	 maybe some arcane house could tell us   how to deal with these things  vexahlia yes yes yes yes  do we have permission to enter within the next few days   obviously we might need to be prepared  tiberius yes do we have badges that we wear over    so that they know   nostoc ill speak with the men they’ll let you down  if you come back good on you   i think our business here is done  percy yes  tiberius very good  matt at which 
none	 point you hear muffled in the distance   a loud ringing of a very loud bell   at which point he kinda perks up a bit  nostoc our business here is done   please shove off  scanlan which way do we go  matt he looks over to the two other guards who are up front   the two carvers say “this way”  liam while he is talking i take a flask out of my cloak and   approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour   a little bit of it into 
none	 the flask  matt sleight of hand check  sam oh jesus you’re stealing beer  orion no no because we have to give it to those guards  sam fuck those guards i can kill them all  travis roll roll roll you bastard roll  laura can i talk to good old nostoc while hes doing that  matt he currently does not seem like   the talkative type at the moment   you can certainly try  taliesin i am going to make a fumble   i am going to attempt to assist a 
none	 slight of hand   with a bit of a fumble  matt he has already rolled it  laura damn it i am going to fall down   in front of nostoc  sam oh  liam 13   sam no chance  laura i am going to fall down in front of nostoc  liam 13  marisha come on  taliesin he is distracted by a bell  matt as you fill your flask  all groan  matt you hear this loud  clears throat   vex ow ow oh my ankle  
none	 all laugh  vex it hurts so very much  matt this is the first time you have witnessed   the pristine delicate yet well trained palm of a dwarven hand   go straight to its forehead  all laugh  vax i carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say   “in my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together   and i would like not much but to just pour us all a drink   and agree surely this cask is weeks worth of”  nostoc get 
none	 out of my office  sam let’s just go  marisha take the flask  vax i can see it is a cultural difference my apologies  tiberius stop it just go what are you doing  liam you’re one to talk  orion i am on the earring  matt at which point a second and a third bell starts going off   and the guards that are waiting for you guys    they start leading you outside   and as you make your way outside the main building   you can now hear 
none	 voices shouting down the corridor below  laura i lean down to one of the guards and say  vex what is that bell for  dwarf guard something is flushing out of the quarry  laura flushing what does that mean  dwarf guard we dont know  matt at which point some of the guards are   motioning each other to follow and some of them   start going down to one of the tracks that leads down   to one of the nearest quarry below  taliesin just try and like practically usher  
none	  our guards in that direction   since they seem to want to go in that direction   let’s see if we can push them in that direction  matt okay you guys follow down towards the quarry   you ask the guard that question and he goes  guard i dont know we have had quite a few   interesting things come through  vex like what oh like what  travis he already said  matt he kinda swallows and says  guard things i cant describe  percy well we can certainly help 
none	 lead on  marisha is there anybody running out  matt not yet as you head halfway down the quarry walkway   you begin seeing dwarves start running out   of one of the large quarry tunnels  marisha i grab one of them  matt well they are quite a distance from you   you are still walking down the side   they’re a good 100 feet from you  marisha okay  matt they start running at you you see blood   streaking down one of their faces  grog yes  matt 
none	 theyre charging out one of them has a weapon and is limping   and you start seeing small green scampering things rushing through   1 2 3 4 6 10 goblins come rushing out of the tunnel  marisha oh shit  scanlan aah i don’t like these guys  marisha don’t you have a family history or something  laura we should attack them i string my bow  matt the three dwarves that are running out one of them gets   hacked down by one of the goblins and jumps on them   and 
none	 is tearing his neck  taliesin i take a shot right now  laura i take a shot i shoot it  matt okay both you guys roll   liam i throw a dagger  matt you throw a dagger  liam yeah  matt three of you roll for attack  taliesin 19  laura 15  orion is there a clear area with just a bunch of goblins running  matt there is an open almost like a funnel towards the tunnel  orion i’m gonna throw a little fireball right there   where those guys 
none	 are  matt okay so you guys you all hit from this distance  because goblins are puny little things   they are still a little small to see but you are all   pretty well trained and pretty honed with your aim   you fire simultaneously gunshots echo through the hallway   arrows flying dagger you see three goblins   just fall off a nearby dwarf who goes  dwarf unh thank   matt  at which point a large fireball explodes   killing off about 10 or so of the goblins 
none	  and probably 2 of the dwarves  tiberius i am sorry about that  matt at which point the guards kinda stopped  scanlan did you do that  tiberius yeah  scanlan fuck  matt and they they start looking around and   they see you pull out your weapons and they all   take a step back and realise   they dont want to die either  guard well go if you’re going to help go  percy we run straight in  matt with you guys charging in you can now see  
none	  a handful more goblins are rushing out   they are like running really fast sprinting   keyleth i throw entangle up in the distance   where they’re coming from  matt okay what’s the radius on that  marisha like a hundred feet  matt thats the range what is the radius  marisha oh 20 foot radius  matt 20 foot radius okay   so you find a portion of the central part   where the things exit from the tunnel and   you see these strange reddish vines begin   
none	 to protrude and to begin to grab   nearby goblins and pull them up in this massive   weird vine creature  at which point you hear  stomp stomp  and you now see two   larger ogrelike creatures come storming out  keyleth oh shit  tiberius wonderful  laura ogres  matt everyone roll initiative  all cheer  marisha oh fuck goddammit  orion fuck yeah  travis take it  matt all right do we have initiatives 25 to 20  taliesin 27  marisha holy shit you rolled a 20

none	 liam and can i sneak attack while prone  matt youre stealthed currently so you would   technically get a sneak attack   but you have to be in melee for you to get the other bonus   so it would be sneak attack for this damage if you were to roll   or if you were to throw a dagger at it   you would get the sneak attack   liam okay so that means just one throw instead of two  matt you can throw both daggers at it  liam all 
none	 right i feel so inspired by scanlans bardic tunes   scanlan singing yeah  matt you can add it after you make the roll by the way  laura so if you do a really good roll then you dont need it  liam okay 19 plus eleven is thirty  matt and because youre a rogue isnt that critical for you  liam yeah oh yeah  matt two criticals   liam and the other one the other one is a 16 plus plus   is a 26   matt that also hits   
none	 so you chuck both daggers out they both arc around  liam  i meant to say i was aiming at its eye   the main heads eye  laura no you shouldve said that first   matt for flavor its fine just go ahead its fine  liam all right four   laura four   liam plus seven is eleven plus five  18 20 20 times   is 40 plus 4   44 thats the first dagger  matt yeah 44 damage  liam 44   travis damn  matt rogues 
none	 man  marisha help me help  laura thats just one dagger  liam thats just one 4 plus 2 is 6  is that sneak attack no  matt no only one sneak attack per turn  liam okay   laura 40 and then 6 on the other one  matt all right so one actually hit one of the heads   one of the various naga heads directly into its face   as it does  it goes through both and you can see it begin  reeling from the attack   it’s looking 
none	 pretty rough actually   laura oh kill it  matt you can see the stitches beginning to come apart at   some of the seams and you can see a black ichorous liquid   spill out from some of the suture marks  liam and just a reminder the daggers folks   blink back to the belt on my waist  all laugh  matt because magic   magic rogue shit   matt keyleth youre up  laura kill him kill him  marisha okay so im really upset really hurting   so 
none	 out of anger i take my staff and i go  bam     and i crack and do thunderwave   pushing him back 15 feet   matt all right   makes the saving throw   but he gets pushed back so he takes damage just half damage  marisha okay 2d8 6  matt as youre setting up your gun   it gets slammed right point blank to you  marisha oh sorry  laura and travis no thats good   marisha it takes 4 damage  matt 4 damage all 
none	 righty  marisha and then im going to turn into an eagle  sam laughs as one does  matt so well say for that because i forgot to bring an eagle  youre now a  eagle sounds  marisha and i   i fly   away  travis away  all laugh  orion away  keyleth far far away  tiberius where are you going  laura you got 4 damage good job keyleth  scanlan tell our story keyleth  marisha and then i cry in the corner and   rock back and 
none	 forth a little bit  and thats my turn  matt i forgot to mention you actually take half damage   for the saving throw for the venom   so you still wouldve taken  14 points of poison damage so just mark that  orion okay  matt it is half damage on a save  matt all right that brings us to scanlan  sam can i bonus inspire myself  matt because youre scanlan ill say yes  all laugh  matt you have such a high opinion of yourself  that even you could 
none	 inspire yourself   so yes why not  scanlan singing it would help me to acquire some dice to inspire   so i inspire myself first   and move 5 feet back so im on the same row as him  matt there   sam not that far  matt there  sam yes   and them im going to cast lightning bolt at him  matt okay straight line that way   sam straight line that way   matt you dont have to roll to hit   you just roll damage 
none	 on that  i make a saving throw  sam oh i didnt even need to inspire  matt whats your dc on the spell   top you your spell list  orion 17  sam thank you   matt 17 thats a failure on its saving throw  go ahead and roll 8d6  laura 8d6  kill him  matt bards gets spells from other classes  travis if you kill i will take a shit on this table   sam 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14   liam its gone 
none	   sam 24  matt 24 points of lightning damage  travis no way   sam yes   marisha kill it kill it   sam yells turns into a sung note  matt how do you want to do this   all yelling  marisha wait wait is this the first time youve   sam ive never killed anything before   travis never killed anything in two years   liam wait wait   for the people at home we live to hear matt say  all how do you want to 
none	 do this   matt i let the player describe their victory  so as you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane energy   you release a sheer bolt of energy   how do you want to do this  sam the bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up   through its spine   slowly but painfully torturing it   as it slowly slowly feels the effect   coursing through its evil body   matt because of your bardic ability to actually shape sound   from 
none	 an arcane standpoint   a lightning bolt should be an instant flash  of arcane energy you actually cause it to crawl  you control it as it begins to cascade up the torso   of this horrible abomination   as it does you can see the bolts splinter and destroy   each suture wound as each of its begins to slough off   the rest of the torso until nothing is left but the single head   screaming into the air   as the bolt makes its way up the neck  
none	  its eyes burst out in a blast of energy   matt and the body falls limp to the ground  sam can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an s  matt a scanlan shaped lightning bolt   is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast  all cheer  travis well done scanlan well done  matt as the dust settles the adrenalin still pumping   in your system scanlan  all the rest of the dwarves begin stepping down   putting their crossbows down looking down at the little gnome 
none	   that created a storm from its hands and one of them   pats him on the shoulder and goes  dwarf well  well done  scanlan thank you just promise me youll tell pike about this   dwarf okay  scanlan because it was really cool right   dwarf that was pretty cool  scanlan okay good   matt all the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from   and the one that you spoke to earlier goes  dwarf so… thats the kind of thing thats been coming out
