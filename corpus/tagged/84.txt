unfolds  now its your turn to roll  fire burning  matt welcome back everybody last we left off the mighty nein had been returning from  nicodranas they had made their way /none/ northward from the menagerie coast left their ship in the care  of their favorite tortle to earn money at sea while youre away  liam i like tortles  matt you made your way northward past the wuyun gorge back into the dwendalian empire passed  through trostenwald and alfield and met up with bryce for a bit to catch up and then made your  way toward felderwin upon arriving you discovered the city was still visibly scarred from  the recent assault that it had seemed to suffer at the hands of the kryn dynasty from xhorhas /none/  upon perusing the streets you came to discover that the location that nott was leading you towards was  in ashes this apothecary upon inspecting the vicinity you did not find a body but you did  find a basement where you found ruined furniture a few traps a chest and a mysterious chair that  has grabbed the nations imagination  sam whispering chairotoa  travis whispering what is the chair  laughter  matt yall going to die you thought the gazebo was bad anyway so  travis did we put the chair in the bag of /none/ holding  sam we shouldve  matt however you also found that apparently the person who previously had lived there was nowhere  to be found and the son of that individual was being held at a nearby home of another person who  lives here in felderwin you went there with nott nott took the form of a halfling and proceeded to  speak to this child as her son after a bit of interesting conversation and curiosity you said  goodbye and you turned to find these two powerful magic users that caleb had identified as members  /none/ of the cerberus assembly were walking their way towards the ashen ruins of the apothecary deep in  conversation that is where we left off so mighty nein what would you like to do  liam before we leap in could you give a quick physical description again of the two archmages  matt yes i can do that we have lady vess derogna yes shes an elven woman in fine flowing  clothes of green and black deep green with black designs across and around the edges of the  billowing sleeves jewelry around the fingers a number of /none/ rings and a series of necklaces  they each contain some sort of a circular gem  that dangles from them like a little collection of  colors she has short medium brown hair and appears to be of not a young elven age  necessarily but not as old as her current compatriot which is martinet lunidus daleth  who is the archmage of domestic protections  he had long white hair  liam also elven  matt also elven they are both elven  laura deep blue robes  matt yep keeping tabs on that thats really the /none/ extent of what you can see at this distance  you are currently a few houses down standing  outside of old ediths house and in the moment  of the tension of the conversation you had just had and the intensity of notts disposition  glancing and seeing them walking up and stopping  right at the cusp and talking to each other  liam at the apothecary not where we are two separate locations  matt yes  liam we need to go now right now  sam yes yes we should get off the streets right away /none/  liam these things we have we have to get them out of here  sam i know a place we can go we can go to near the river theres a river near here  laura lead the way  liam now please  sam okay how far is the river  matt from where youre standing here not terribly far maybe a ten minute walk  laura is it the opposite direction of the hmmhmm  matt you could loop around a bit probably go southward youre not that far from the  samir river you can scoot /none/ a southwestern direction in an arc probably make it  15 minutes to avoid them entirely  laura take the cart too huh  sam yes  laura lets go  sam i will lead them to a spot on the river bank that i know  matt all right moving past the handful of people in the city that are noticing this strange band of  adventurers that have wandered through you make your way past the outskirts and you can see the  river itself cruising right along it would be a beautiful landscape if there wasnt this /none/ intensity  of emotion and the distant haze of longgrayed smoke that still hangs over the vicinity of the  partially burned farmlands nevertheless nott leads you over towards one of the shaded banks  under a few trees and you come to a stop  marisha are we being followed  matt make a perception check  travis first roll of the night no fucking pressure first roll of the night you got this  marisha that didnt count thats good 21  matt glancing about you do not see anybody keeping watch what you do notice however is /town/  that a lot of the patrolling righteous brand the small bands that have been keeping tabs are all  gathering towards the southern edge where the farm fields of the felderwin tillage hit the town of  felderwin where as they were scattered theyre all amassing in one space  liam we heard someone describe the operatives from xhorhas coming up out of the ground  over by the farmlands correct  matt correct thats as much as youve heard  laura so hey what the fuck  liam yeah thats a good question but also we just stole /town/ some very important things and we saw  what is probably the owners going into the building is there anything we need to do in this  town now to help you do what you need to do here or can we leave  sam no we cant leave no we cant leave i mean you can leave but i need to stay  liam is this person youre looking for here do you know do you have any ideas  sam i dont know but i know that i dont know i dont know where he is but i /none/ know that well  find clues here or we may find clues here i need to look i need to look and i need to start  right away and i suppose you all can go if you want but  laura i will stay and help you  travis yeah well stay caleb are you worried about another attack  laura what are you so nervous about  taliesin we are a target  liam we were being stared at as we came through here  taliesin i think we need somewhere safe to talk i think theres a /town/ lot of things we need to cement up  sam this is about as quiet a spot as i know in town i dont want to go to a pub or anything  taliesin no obviously not we need privacy  laura i mean youre just here to check on your son thats a good cover i guess  was it your son or are you even a goblin  sam okay all right so you probably have some questions for me and thats all right  travis one or two  marisha like a thousand  laura i mean /none/ if its your son thats really sad nott  sam i know im sorry im sorry for surprising you back there and im sorry  that i didnt tell you more before  laura are you okay  sam i dont know but i feel like i dont think any of us need to pretend that we all dont have  some secrets weve all been keeping some secrets from each other sometimes i feel like even maybe  the thing that brought us together is that were bonded by dishonesty a little bit  taliesin not me no secrets /none/ open book  laura im pretty open too  marisha i hear you  sam well some of us anyway for me anyway ive been holding onto some secrets i feel like  its almost like putting up an armor or something to protect you from the past or from regrets or  something and i feel like for some of us it could also be like a chain weighing us down and  keeping us from moving forward maybe its time now to remove that chain and be open and honest so  that we can move ahead so /none/ yes ill tell you what you want to know what do you want to know  travis are you a goblin  laura is that your son for real  sam okay well hi my name is nott the brave and i am a little goblin girl but once upon a time i  was veth a young halfling woman and before that a halfling child who grew up being told that she  was not pretty and not brave and not coordinated and not smart and just not  laura and thats you this is how you looked  /none/ sam yeah  laura but youre so pretty  sam i was then you know time went by and i got a little bit older i was made fun of quite a bit  i had this people thought i was strange because i collected things i had lots of collections  they were really outstanding i collected wax seals and pieces of colored paper and  some buttons and fabric  marisha you collected wax seals  sam all kinds yeah  marisha you still have those  sam im afraid not  marisha thats cool actually  sam /town/ they didnt think so i had brothers and people in town who would ridicule me  laura that was here  sam yes i lived here one day i was playing a game with some other boys and they dared  one of their friends to give me a kiss  laura spin the bottle  sam the boy was very nice and he actually seemed to like it he and i became friendly and  eventually we did what people do and got married  marisha oh thats not i went somewhere else yeah married yeah  sam he /none/ didnt mind my strangeness and i helped him get his apothecary up and running he was a  brilliant chemist and could make acids and potions and oils and bleaches for fabrics and dyes and all  sorts of things i helped him and he took care of me eventually we had a baby named luke and he  was a bright boy very smart he learned to talk very early and walk very early such a smart boy  thats who you saw back there is my son  laura so was he right did you die  sam /town/ i think so we had a rough winter in felderwin there was not a lot of crops i think  some of the animals had died that winter this river ive brought you to this is a beautiful  place i used to come here with yeza its also an important place because this is the the goblins  would come from over there they would come and raid us from the other side of the river i think  after that winter they got particularly hungry and more dangerous and more daring they came into  town and raided /none/ more and more until one day they took us they took me and my husband and my child  they held us in one of their camps i dont know if it was days or weeks im not sure luke was  not doing well he was starting to starve and i knew that we needed to get out of there somehow  yeza is a very bright man but hes not a fighter so i had to do what i had to do we ran in the  dead of night they werent fast ive been chased a lot /none/ in my life by boys making fun of me  im pretty fast so i told them to run to the river and i broke off and i ran a different way  the goblins followed me when they found me they surrounded me and i fought i had a vial of acid that  yeza had handed me and i threw it in the face of the one trying to catch us they didnt like that  they took me back to their camp i think he died from his wounds and he was something like their  leader /none/ and he had a wife she brought me to another woman in a hood a magic woman  i dont know who she was i never saw her eyes or anything this goblin told the woman make her  suffer and they did they brought me to this river and they drowned me in it i can still feel  the water in my lungs and my ears and my nose and then nothing until i woke up and saw the hands  those hands the skin then i looked in a puddle i could see what they made me /none/ they made me  everything that i thought i was not pretty not good just not ill be honest ive started  forgetting what it feels like to be a halfling to be me i dont remember everything any more  i feel like every day im more and more goblin i dont like it at all i dont like myself at all  im sorry i didnt tell you im sorry i lied and im sorry caleb that i didnt tell you  i shouldve told you you wouldve understood and maybe you couldve helped me i dont know /town/ i feel  like youre almost there almost strong enough to help but i didnt want to distract you from your path  anyway thats how i got to you thats why i cant be in that town and he cant see me like  this my son cant see me like this no one there can  taliesin does your husband know does he not know  sam ive sent him things  taliesin so he knows youre alive  sam well i only recently started signing the letters i dont know if he believes it or not  /town/ i dont know what he would think of me the people in that town theyre taught to kill a goblin on  sight or run and get help children are told rhymes if he saw me like this  i dont even know if he would believe its me  taliesin hell know you nott you ran and got help and here we are its the right thing to do  were here to help  laura how long has it been  sam since ive been like this well they turned me and then they kept me around they /none/ used me like  a slave really i would clean out their messes and clean up after the meals i would help their one  that tortured i would help him for months maybe six months then i ran thats when i found you  shortly after so maybe a year no more more than a year year and a half i dont know  not exactly its all sort of a blur  laura i feel like we can get this fixed  taliesin were here now  laura we can do something  taliesin we just have to /none/ take some time think carefully and slowly  sam i dont think we have time hes gone they could be killing him now  these people that have him  travis do we know who we think that is  laura is it the people you know  liam is anyone else is there anyone coming do we hear anything  matt make a perception check  liam natural one  matt your emotions are transfixed and even though you look around  your attentions still focused on nott  nothing catches your eye  taliesin we can do something /none/ about this but youre going to have to trust us and youre going  to have to be careful because if we move too quickly were just going to go running the  wrong direction and alone and you need help  sam i will try to restrain myself but honestly i dont know for how long  taliesin would it help if we cleared your head  sam what do you mean  taliesin well if you need a minute to be here we maybe sift some of the contents of that flask  out of you for a /none/ little while just for a minute you can get back to it when you need it  but for now maybe impulse may not be your friend right now  sam okay if you think so mr clay  taliesin im going to try and do that we had a brief conversation about that last week  matt so youre casting lesser restoration  taliesin yeah  matt okay  laura try to undrunk nott  matt technically alcohol is a toxin  taliesin i have to know what it is i have to be going for it  matt /none/ yeah so ill allow it  taliesin i am so sorry  matt you feel this warm glow emanating from caduceus hands and then in that moment the fuzzy  numbness that you are accustomed to sitting in especially in places of great fear or emotion fades  and everythings back to being crystal clear  taliesin sometimes the truth takes a little while to get there  sam this feels much worse it feels terrible actually this is terrible this is how you all are  all the time this is not fun  travis majority  taliesin yeah /none/  marisha nott i know this place is  laura do you want some candy  sam yes lots  marisha this place is quiet but do you actually know if there a waterfall upstream a little bit  or a brook something with some noise that might drown out anyone whos listening  taliesin maybe somewhere where we can sleep too  marisha further off the beaten path we walk upstream maybe  sam is there such a place  matt theres not much in the way of a waterfall unfortunately youre in the center of the valley  /town/ so what hills there are are just hills the river here continues cutting through the valley but  youre probably a good off the top of my head 40 or so miles from any elevation to cause  a major waterfall  marisha any babbling brooks  matt youre next to the river and what little noise its making its nice  taliesin we know that there are tunnels  liam by the farmlands  marisha which is i think where all those soldiers were going  taliesin well maybe we should find somewhere in town to hold up and /tavern/ well keep you out of sight  matt there was that one inn that burned down but there is one inn you know called the goldfield  tavern and lodge thats one of the more traveled inns a lot of people that come in and out of  felderwin thats one of the more popular destinations  taliesin whats your husbands name  sam yeza brenatto  taliesin i think perhaps if were going to we should come together with a game plan i think it  would be respectable if people thought that someone was looking for yeza in /none/ his interests  people will be less suspicious if were asking questions about someone who disappeared if we  were perhaps hired by a trust fund of your son or otherwise and this is something that is owed to him  its just business we dont have to let them know its personal  travis thats actually very clever  sam thats fine but and im sorry caleb im sorry for what i said before i feel like part of  what well need to do to find him is to know what he was doing before he was taken /none/  and that involves you  marisha yeah you definitely puked all over that apothecary so its clear that somethings not right  sam i dont want to force you to do anything you dont want to but i need you now i need you to  tell me what you know what these people might be doing or might have taken him to or done with him  laura i mean it does seem like they were using him  marisha what is dunamis  laura how do you know them  taliesin thats a lot you can take /none/ your time as youre ready  liam are we going to  sam do you want to get somewhere safer first  travis further away why dont we keep moving upstream whats the direction  away from the conflict  matt theres northeast and southwest northeast would be more in the direction of the fields and  clearer view southwest would be further away from civilization  taliesin ill also say we can start the wagon up and i can drive and keep an eye out if youre  all inside the wagon no ones going to see any of /town/ you  travis sure lets head south  marisha lets find a patch of woods to hide in  laura are there woods  matt theres little clusters of trees here and there  taliesin it may be in the end safer staying in town people staying in the woods seem like  theyre trying to avoid something and theres a lot of soldiers if youre on business you go to  town even if the towns a little rough well keep going around when its time to go i think  maybe we go into town and get a /town/ room maybe make a little bubble in the room if we have to  liam i dont want to talk in town  taliesin were going to take a scenic route ill take a long time and if i see people  im not going to drive towards them  travis before we go are you sure your son is safe with this  sam no im not sure at all  travis what did you tell her last are they staying are they going  sam theyre staying i gave them some money edith seemed to think that they /town/ were okay for the  time being and that theres not going to be any more imminent attacks  travis do other people in town know that old edith cares for your son that theyre connected  in some way  sam no idea  marisha does old edith know your current form  sam no one does  marisha she just thinks youre not dead  sam well im not  liam what do you think that your child made of that  sam i dont know but i know that i needed to see him i forgot what /none/ he looked like and he forgot  what i looked like i feel like thats impossible thats unsustainable we need to know the ones we  love and i dont know what that was i dont know how he felt but for me its a step as painful as  it was it will be a step towards something  marisha nott you drowned you drowned and you just spent three months underwater  thats incredible i dont know if you realize that but  sam yeah it was great it was it sucked it was terrible  taliesin it /none/ was very brave  sam you guys have rubbed off on me i guess  travis i dont want to tell you what to do but i feel like our previous experience would lean  towards getting your son and her out of here especially if the people that have taken your  husband are still here if theyre searching for answers or asking people questions  that could lead to her and him  laura they could go stay with my mama they could stay at the lavish chateau for the time being  taliesin anywhere west really  /none/ travis nows the time to move them  sam right how how would i convince  travis maybe its not you maybe one of us go  sam go to tell them  travis mmhmm  taliesin not a bad idea  sam how do they get there its a dangerous journey even for us you saw the borders  marisha loops into caduceus social worker plan actually  taliesin i dont know if necessarily crossing the border is the way to go but at least going  further inland  travis if they do decide to cross i think /none/ theyre less concerned with people going out  more than coming in  sam do we know any place safe closer is alfield safe  taliesin safe as anything  laura bryce is there  taliesin thats not a bad idea send a letter ask bryce if they can take care of this  marisha do you think bryce would be down for more responsibility and obligations  taliesin i imagine if we pack a few gold in its not much to find some room and board for a  couple people  marisha yeah thats true  travis if /none/ it does continue to drift that way bryce will be sure to get them out quick  taliesin or send word  marisha plus alfield is near the border and the gates shorter journey out  laura i could send a message see if bryce would be okay with that what do you think  sam okay yes please do  travis theres a lot to figure this will be one less thing to worry about  marisha then we try to find yeza  sam absolutely yes  laura im going to not be able to do this in /none/ 25 words its so hard  matt cast it twice  travis this is going to bryce  laura this is going to bryce okay  sam i believe in you jester you can do this  travis woman and child incoming take care of them  laura oh thats good dont talk in full sentences why didnt i think of that  taliesin stop  laura do i say stop  taliesin stop  travis dont waste it on a stop  taliesin i mean thats what you would do if youre doing the telegram  laura i could /none/ just vocally stop because bryce will hear me  taliesin stop  laura right okay im going to cast sending  laura hello  travis oh boy  laura its jester two people incoming a woman and child take care of them please  were sending money with them  sam you have two more words  laura this is important  liam cut off the is  laura i thought i had five more words  matt you have two more  laura okay  taliesin signed oh  laura please help  marisha is it one word pleasehelp /none/  matt as the sporadic phrases make their way through the arcane weaves of the various magical  ley lines that invisibly traverse the exterior of exandria they make their way towards bryces ear  somewhere in alfield and they respond a moment later all right ill do my best  please dont send too many more  laughter  matt that was it  laura okay i think theyre going to help  sam okay thats something  travis bryce is shaking their head trying to get better reception and its not working  taliesin water in the ear /none/  marisha youre cutting out and i cant  laura okay oh sorry about that  taliesin its nothing  sam so shall we ride around a bit  laura yes because i want to hear what caleb has to say  taliesin i also want to get a sense of things so were going to take a lazy meander around the  area i want to get a sense of where things are get a map in my head and im going to be  paying very close attention  matt through the city  taliesin no on the /none/ outskirts  matt okay itll take you a while  taliesin im going to keep going around until they  matt okay make a perception check for me caduceus as you guys are passing around the  southern edge heading towards the western side of felderwin  taliesin thats okay its all right eight wait no im so sorry thats wrong 13  matt okay keeping an eye out the main thing you notice it seems like a majority of the righteous  brand have gathered and are heading northeast they are leaving felderwin  marisha leaving  matt correct /none/  taliesin all right does it look like theyve discovered the tunnels or no  matt you dont know youre too far away you havent really asked any specific questions to the  local crownsguard  taliesin thatll be for civilization thats cool  matt best you can see here the flames have been long out what brief cinders and wisps of smoke  that had been slowly burning themselves out over the past couple of weeks or so are on the very  tail end it looks like felderwin has fallen to at least a semblance of temporary neutrality /none/ the  people are going about their lives the tillage the damage that has been done has been done  and now its just trying to pick up and move on  liam were in the wagon  matt youre in the wagon youre now on the western side of the village where you can see the  northward tillage all around  taliesin im on the lookout and i will let anybody know if anyones within 60 yards  marisha are you listening to where you can contribute  taliesin i think im listening but im not doing a /none/ very good job of it  travis because youre checking out around us  taliesin because im  travis periscoping  marisha hey jester  laura mm  marisha since were going to try and be honest with each other and turn a new leaf  laura are you in love with me  marisha well in a way i didnt sleep with dairon she wasnt my roommate  she was my teacher  laura oh  marisha i dont know why i told you that  laura i dont either  marisha yeah  laura teachers are cool too /none/  sam you slept with your teacher  marisha no i didnt sleep with her at all  i totally made that up  laura you just cared about your teacher  marisha yeah  laura good for you  marisha thanks  sam i know theres more pressing matters but what did she teach you  marisha how to kick ass and take names bitch  sam cool  travis snaps  marisha yeah i dont know i guess its  easier to pretend like you dont care  laura well i figured you cared since you  were /none/ checking up on her  marisha yeah im a little transparent sometimes  laura laughs i totally thought she was your roommate you were really good about that  marisha thank you  laura youre welcome  marisha i mean dont get me wrong id totally tap that but  travis all right can we maybe circle back to the  laura caleb we can tell youre really scared and thats okay to be scared we just dont know why  travis maybe if you share with us your apprehensions itll ease it a bit  liam deep breath mist /none/  marisha you got this man  liam your name is veth  sam it was  liam my name was bren aldric ermendrud was  sam thats why you looked at me that day  liam i uh  laura did you die too  sam twinsies  liam i have been using you all  laura how  liam i am from rexxentrum i attended the soltryce academy and i was plucked by one of the  cerberus assembly with a few others and was being trained to do the kinds of things that  i fear may /town/ have been done to  laura yeza  liam ja and a lot of big plans for me that didnt pan out and i went a little crazy  and i ran away i ran away ive been on the run for a long time and i was tired of starving  and i met i met you and was a little less hungry for a while i have just been afraid for  a long time and two of the people in that town over there are on the cerberus assembly  sam do you know them  liam /none/ i know who they are  laura would they know who you are  liam i dont think so but i have walked past their portraits at school many times  marisha ew  laura theyre high up then huh  liam one of them is the head of the cerberus assembly  laura holy shit  travis the head of the whole thing  sam it was that big  marisha mister fancypants  laura wait isnt that where you want to go fjord  travis i mean i did thats the center of magical teaching in the empire /none/ as i understood it  laura its really bad or something  liam theres good teachers there its everything that they describe it to be but after going there  for several months one of the assembly who also would teach on occasion started interviewing me  calling me in and asking me a lot of questions he put me in advanced class me and a few others  i dont want you all to be seen with me because if you are seen with me by one of them  they will use you to get to me  /town/ sam i mean i dont want them to see me either because theyll kill me and everyone im with  anyone in town so i think well be hiding for some time  liam you met the man who trained me  his name is trent ikithon  laura thats why you always make that face  im sorry caleb  liam im not a very good person  laura well i dont think our actions define who we are all the time good people do bad things  sometimes even bad people do good things i think youre a /none/ good person  marisha for the record nott i dont think its us thats been rubbing off on you i think its  you thats been rubbing off on us  travis also i dont think a very bad person would care about us  laura i dont think a very bad person would care that he was very bad  marisha do you care about us youve told us several times how youve been using us  laura are you secretly in love with me  laughter  liam im worried about your husband i know the things that /none/ they can do  and i start to unwrap one of my arms  sam arms  laura like the skin  liam no i have been wearing bandages on my arm and there are little very faint  scars all up the arm  sam cuts or burns  liam they are scars faint scars from cuts  sam from cuts  liam he used to put crystals in he experimented on us on the three of us  sam what would they do crystals  liam he was trying to strengthen us  marisha the dunamis  liam /none/ no the first time i had ever seen that word was in your libraries just haphazardly  scrawled into a book no explanation no everything was for empire we were being trained  to serve our empire above all else he was a little mad himself that is he was mad  marisha im curious as to how much was for the empire and how much the empire was a veil for his  own personal exploits  liam he believed that the unwashed masses relied on their base instincts and the highest calling  was to rise above the /none/ muck and control the cattle for the good of all  laura that sounds like a bad person  liam but we were are at war many of us felt that way feel that way  sam do you still feel that way  liam i dont believe in anything now  travis this trent does he know these two that we saw  liam yes i dont want one more thing on my head to have you guys its probably too late anyway  travis how powerful are these two our normal tricks would they fall short  liam /none/ the cerberus assembly are the most powerful mages in the empire over two centuries ago a  number of mages went to war in the streets of rexxentrum it was bloody and awful and  eventually they came to a truce and banded together and proposed to the king at the time  that they serve as an advising body alongside the throne  laura would they see if we were disguised or would they have to look for us do you know what i mean  liam i dont know for sure but there is a reason why i /none/ did not use anything like that back there  laura okay  travis so we need to give them a very wide berth at the same time we need to figure out where  sam why would they have taken my husband he was not a magic person he was just a chemist  liam i dont know it is something to do with the thing  laura it says it  liam but i dont know why him  laura it says his instincts are solid  sam what instincts  laura yeza im assuming while i find this /none/ alchemist obnoxious in his simplicity  im sorry i dont believe that  sam i dont either  laura the academys eye for talent proves itself again  liam was he gifted in his work  sam he was very brilliant in his work but i never saw him do any magicky things  travis did he experiment  laura it says they want him to produce a number of batches of that liquid the one that we stole  liam that is what is written about there it talks about listen i dont pretend to know what  were /none/ talking about but it does not seem like anything that i ever studied  sam he was good at what he did he could refine anything  laura they wouldnt kill him then they need him to make batches over the next 12 to 16 months  travis im sure hes alive but if he was good at breaking things down taking them apart  experimenting on things this thing that we have falls directly into that  liam it says they were looking for a way to achieve their ends without the object i dont  know what they /tavern/ need i hope he is alive i truly do they will make his life very painful though  marisha trent ikithon was looking at yasha he was sideeyeing yasha  travis what do you mean  laura well shes really hot  marisha i feel like ive heard these words before when we were in that bar he looks for  prodigies people with innate talent i dont think it matters  sam if they took my husband where would they have taken him their headquarters are in  rexxentrum  liam ja  sam at a school at a /none/  liam the city of rexxentrum  sam the whole city is their headquarters  liam theyre based there  marisha the cerberus assembly actually has a pretty heavy hold on rexxentrum  liam and the empire they are close to as powerful arguably more powerful than the king  laura i wonder if maybe we can break him out before he gets there maybe he  it only just happened  sam do they have magical means of transport  liam we watched lunidus daleth appear  200 feet in front of us  sam so he could already /none/ be there  liam maybe  marisha id be willing to lay money on it  sam when did you get your new name  liam i used a lot of names caleb is just what i told you  travis what do you prefer  liam i dont know caleb lets stick with caleb for now  sam wellshit it seems like if we are going to chase down my husband youre going to  have to go into danger too much danger  liam stuttering i honestly dont know if we can if we are up to this /town/ unless theyre  en route on land maybe but thats  all the might of the empire  laura are we going to have to scout out and listen in on peoples conversations see if we can  travis we should ask to see if anyone saw a carriage anything leaving town with yeza  laura maybe if we go with our insurance company scheme we can say that we believe theres been  fraud and hes not really dead or something  sam and  marisha nott  sam yes  marisha sorry you were going to say something /none/  sam no i just had more questions  marisha all right i was going to ask you a question i dont think you know the answer  marisha though your son mentioned that a mean lady with pointy ears keeps coming by  sam was that one of these people that we saw  laura lady  sam they had pointy ears theyre elves right  liam theyre both elves  sam then what one of them look mean  marisha well if hes talking about vess derogna  sam is that someone who would have do you know /none/ her to be someone who would be someone who could  harness chemicals and  liam vess derogna im sorry no vess derogna is the archmage of antiquities she is half a recluse  she taught at the school not me or years above me  travis and laura what does that mean antiquities  sam would she be interested in the things that yeza was helping  liam shes a historian she knows she has uncovered mysteries of the past they would say at  school shes a history buff and awful as well probably  sam could she /none/ be the one who is visiting my home  marisha it sounds like theyve been here watching your husband for quite some time which means  checking in on your son  liam daleth is domestic protection he is the head of the military if they are both here  i would imagine that he is here overseeing all of the red brands we saw and she is probably here  trying to figure out whats in that bag  sam then do we have because i dont know how this all connects do we know why the cricks also /none/  attacked did they sense a disturbance in their juice or whatever that stuff is the dunamis  laura do you think maybe theyre attacking because we have the thingy  sam weve had the thingy for a long time it doesnt explain why they would attack here now  travis yeah  liam they could be combing the empire for it  travis it might not be the only one  laura okay  marisha it feels like it is a piece of dunamis right  matt caleb roll an intelligence check for me  liam thank you  /none/ laura be smart be so smart  liam 19  travis pretty smart  matt on the notes where it mentions beacons  laura it says theres other beacons  liam more than one yeah  marisha yeah and this thing that we had was called the beacon right okay  laura okay so theres more than one  liam we saw an attack on the tower in zadash that was ages ago at this point and now theyre  well into the empire  laura as we continue to invoke the beacon that means they have one  sam /town/ or had one  laura right with extremely focused energy of different spectrums and sources divine and  arcane the effects unleashed are ever curious and reach far beyond this laboratory the dunamis  field often sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town with locals complaining of an  ill sluggish sensation akin to being dragged down so  sam so they had one of our dodecahedrons here  laura oh my god what if you put the dodecahedron on the tripod thing that we got right then we  hit it with some sort of spell i wonder /none/ if it would amplify that spell you know what i mean  travis and also ring the dinner bell jester i think thats the more dangerous part were super  close to the front line or at least to them you do that we might get exactly what were asking  for but then trouble might also come calling  laura thats true  marisha the people that we saw fighting having the dc fight in the air full on anime battle  did we recognize the because i know they were wizards that were fighting the crick assassins  /none/ that were coming in  matt it seemed to be the case yes  marisha do we recognise the clothing and appearance of the archmage and lady vess  is it the same people  matt no not the people that are currently with you now no the people that are in the city  marisha but the same robes  matt there isnt a uniform robe there is no and you would know this too even mages in a  union arent like lets all wear similar uniforms they all very much see themselves as  individuals in a /none/ circle  liam what about the annexes  matt hmm  liam the annexes people who it was in the lore that you shared with me  matt oh right yeah no for students and everything there would be uniforms but as far as  members of the assembly proper theres no consistent uniform amongst members of the  assembly as is the nature when you get to a certain level of arcane capabilities even working  with other mages theres a general for the most part an idea of well im still better than them  liam these papers /none/ conjecture that in ghor dranas they are able to control fate and time clearly it  was stolen from them and brought here so it could be the source of their presence here  marisha caleb you were in the library of the cobalt soul when you stumbled upon dunamis for the  for the first time  liam ja it was a note scrawled to the side of a book it said that the cerberus assembly was  looking into some sort of new arcane study and the word dunamis was written that was it  marisha what were /dung/ you looking for when you found it what were you trying to find  liam i was studying history and i need to become more powerful if i want to do anything  marisha you still havent answered my previous question of how you were using us and what that  means to you  liam look at me i am a string bean i am weak as it comes i am weak look at that look at her  laura look at me  marisha her guns are bigger than mine  liam you have no guns that was /none/ an exaggeration that day you are just fast and quick and talented  marisha okay was that a compliment  travis i think so  marisha okay  travis its kind of like when you smile  sam i feel like theres a difference between using someone and relying on someone  marisha thats what i was going to say do you think that fjord was using us you think that  notts been using us  taliesin whispering shut up travis  marisha you know were also here volunteering our help  laura its only using us if you /none/ dont like us do you like us though  liam ja  laura ja  sam you do  liam sighs i oh jester i am glad you see good in me  marisha caleb you were right when you said earlier that its too late now that were involved  but i dont think we see it in the same way that you do its too late now because  whether you like it or not we all care about you and are invested in you know your happiness  i guess so  liam okay  marisha dont /none/ run you can say you dont believe in anything and thats fine believe in us  just a little bit  liam i will consider it heavily  marisha im sorry for not hearing you yesterday honestly you saying that you dont believe in  anything kind of put everything into perspective about that conversation i heard that you were  doubting me and us and our friendship  liam i dont doubt any of you at all  louder you too  taliesin uh yeah ill have some if someones making something  laughter  sam he could give /none/ two shits  travis youre going to have to do this twice  marisha one last time  liam that one will be offcamera  taliesin very offcamera  travis so do we avoid your two professors or do we try to study them divide them  interrogate one of them  laura and liam no  laura fjord theyre way too powerful for us  travis you dont know that  laura fjord  travis what i swallow shit and make it appear in my weapons im fucking down to throw  you know what im saying  laura /none/ you can control water which i can do too im not that powerful  travis you dont have to minimize my new shit okay im real proud of it ive had it for a  fucking hot second  laura im just saying theyve probably been studying for a very long time and if im not wrong  theyre elves and elves live for a very long time and they look kind of old okay  so theyre probably  liam the elder gentleman started the cerberus assembly over 250 years ago  travis yeah maybe we dont try to /none/ separate him right well what about the one that studies  history you met a bunch of really dangerous historians  marisha yeah yeah i have  travis what do i know man im a fucking sailor  laura youre pretty powerful okay youre really strong youre very handsome you got some really  cool spells you can make darkness appear its really awesome  travis listen jester as much as i love this its not about me okay  taliesin hey if you all dont stop arguing im going to turn this cart right around  laura yes sir /town/  taliesin i dont know if you were arguing ive just always wanted to say that  laura we were we were having a big fight  taliesin man  travis so what do we do  taliesin im going to start heading back to town regardless its getting cold  travis we need to send your son on his way  sam all right  travis do we need to try and  liam thats a tangible goal that we can do  travis do we want to ask if your husband was spotted leaving by some sort of /none/ natural means  sam sure yes  laura okay  travis then we kill the two elves  laura easy peasy lemon squeezy maybe we go up into their room at night or something and just  you know stabby stab  travis yeah you seduce one ill seduce the other no problem i have a way with elvish folk  taliesin its like you two have been reading tumblr this is so sorry carry on  travis well deal with one thing at a time  sam it would make me happy to even know that hes alive to /none/ get some sort confirmation that someone  saw him alive or  travis have we talked about sending a message  laura gasp maybe i can send a message to him  travis i mean if hes in super magical headquarters im sure there might be protection  against that but  sam is that a bad idea thats a bad idea  taliesin wait what you trying to find out if someones alive  travis yeah  taliesin i can do that  travis oh  sam how  travis yeah your wildmother the thing you did for me /none/  marisha caduceus is a wild mom  travis no nope no he has  laura hes such a wild mom hes partying all the time  marisha so many wine spritzers  sam moms gone wild  taliesin moms gone wild what hmm  sam what is the process by which you would  taliesin i would just i have a little ritual in the morning meditate on it see if i can feel  anything tugging in some direction and i couldnt know much but i could know something  sam well do you think caleb that they /none/ would sense that is that a magical force  is that a divine force  taliesin its a divine force but i dont think that it would  laura do you have to do it in the morning or can you do it at night  taliesin well i mean id have to sleep  laura oh i understand  liam it all depends on how he reacts if caduceus is able to contact him  taliesin i couldnt know much but i could maybe at the very least give you a yesno maybe  sam that would make me /tavern/ very happy  laura so we head to the inn  sam okay  laira we dont talk about anything when were in the town right  sam except someone has to ask about  travis we can do that cover of night helps  taliesin well im happy were coming to town to talk to this famous alchemist and this has really  thrown something into our plans i dont know what do people throw monkeys into plans  what do people throw  marisha close  sam its a wrench  taliesin a wrench yeah this has wrenched /town/ our monkey  liam a couple of us tonight not me but a couple of us could check the town out and ask  some questions and ask if many people were taken away or not  laura and sam yeah  taliesin hmm not a bad idea  travis to the inn  taliesin im already heading that way  laura im going to take everything that weve been looking at and stick in the bag so it cant  be scried on or something  matt okay you guys make your way towards felderwin proper through this conversation /tavern/ the  majority of the righteous brand has moved on heading northeast towards the front lines  crownsguard are still present and there still is definitely amongst those that are here and nott  you can say that there are more crownsguard present here than there usually are probably just  to keep an eye now that the military has moved on you make your way towards the center of the city  leading them towards the goldfield tavern and lodge heading inside its fairly empty you  place the cart outside for the time being towards the bar on /tavern/ the far end you see the familiar face  of simone deepwell hes the halfling the barkeep and owner dark brown skin short  graywhite hair very cheerful demeanor he seems to be excited at the prospect that folks are  stopping in with all the chaos thats happened as he leans over the front of the counter and goes  sam im going to look like just a gnome  matt okay just a gnome the rest of you keeping it as is  liam hood up and im still dirty as sin  taliesin i think ive still /none/ got a little bit of time on my shaggy redhead wait no am i out now  matt most of the illusions you had in the city have faded at this time since youve been  traversing the exterior  travis im going au natural  laura yeah same  marisha im going to button up and go full cobalt colors  matt you got it anyway simone leans forward and goes why hello there what can i do for you  you looking for rooms for the night  laura mmhmm  matt how many is that book a /none/ room each  travis four rooms three  laura three rooms i think should do it  matt how many  laura three  matt three three rooms all right well we got plenty of space with events being as they have  been thatll put you back about lets say one gold one silver for the three  laura that sounds like a very good deal thank you so much  matt all right no worries  laura yeah ill pay for it  matt fumbles through some keys and passes them out to you feel free to distribute /none/ as need be  if you need anything let me know  travis you said with events being as they have been we noticed theres been a ruckus recently  matt yeah you could say that you could say that i mean ruckus is a word  travis calm the last few days any reason why we should be apprehensive this evening  matt i certainly hope not weve kind of seen kind of the craziest thing felderwins ever seen  in most of its history since war with the dominion so i sincerely hope not i mean its  /tavern/ one less competitive inn but poor jer i just feel bad for everyone that lost their homes and  businesses in that affair its not good  travis i understand the aftermath we saw troops leaving on our way in  matt yeah theyve been here a few weeks just walking around just in case they came back  travis they catch any of those that were guilty of all this  matt no they came in without warning just tore through burned things and left  laura we were hoping to buy some potions while we were here do /none/ you know if theres a good alchemy  shop or anything around  matt yeah see the only real alchemist around here was one of the homesteads that  burned down unfortunately  laura oh no  matt but theres the crossroads not too far from here big trading post in the middle of the  marrow valley which youve been to before thats probably your best bet  laura do you know the alchemy shop what was the name of it  matt oh that was the brenatto apothecary  laura brenatto apo do you know if this brenatto /none/ is around still  matt last i heard brenatto went missing could probably ask the crownsguard i dont think  theyve updated anything but  laura okay  matt most of the folks here got killed in the fire so might best ask them  taliesin crownsguard is probably our best bet if some of the people were looking for happen to be  still missing in the aftermath then  matt i can imagine  taliesin all right  laura great  travis appreciate ya  matt no worries we have two meals here one shortly after dusk and /none/ bright and early in the  morning right after sunup you got about an hour window if you miss it well theres plenty of  should be plenty of food amongst the city to find so good luck  laura did we miss the meal already today then  matt nah youve still got a few hours before sundown so just come on by and go ahead  and get me and my wife cooking  taliesin this is going to sound weird but is there a florist around or anybody who deals with  exotics exotic herbs plants or /none/ otherwise  matt you mean herbs and spices yeah i mean theres felderwin general has all manner of  various flavorings if thats what youre looking for  taliesin something exciting  matt yeah felderwins not known for its excitement necessarily but keep your eye out  who knows what youll find with the right questions i dont know ive seen some wild folk  come in these doors in my days ill tell you that much not all as colorful as you though  so cant say my experiences are a good basis of comparison if you catch my /none/ drift  taliesin im looking forward to a little quiet  matt you and me both now all them soldiers are out of here at least im going to miss the  coinage but i aint going to miss the riffraff  travis thank you  matt yeah no worries ill see you around dinner time then  laura all right  travis ducey a florist  taliesin i need something its nice to have something complicated to use to focus myself  marisha complicated is that what you said  taliesin mm  laura puffing  taliesin not quite /none/ but yeah  laura oh really i was joking  sam like tea  marisha poppy seeds  taliesin anything preferably some sort of flower or living plant but if its  marisha chamomile blackeyed susans  travis stop  taliesin the notion is im looking for something that is a testament to the abilities of the  wildmother so anything that is a gift from her to us something impressive something beautiful  something tasty  laura honey  taliesin ive never tried honey i dont know if it would work but thats interesting  marisha i mean its /none/ essence of flower and bee puke its a miracle  taliesin i usually tend to stick a little closer to the source i also dont really necessarily  know how i would perform the ritual with honey  liam i have a decent amount of molasses if you like  taliesin i honestly dont know the difference between molasses and honey  liam well one is the bee poop but molasses comes out of a tree  taliesin tree poop and bee poop  marisha well its more of a its fine  travis let it ride  sam i /town/ have some tobacco  taliesin that might be interesting but i think i should probably see if theres  anything around possibly  marisha i have this red feather from nila she was also a firbolg  taliesin im not sure how that relates but that is a very beautiful feather  marisha well yeah thats fair  matt if youd like to make an investigation check to wander about the town to see if  you can manage to muster some supplies  sam i can give him some advice on places to look  matt actually you would /none/ yeah take some advantage on that  taliesin do you want to roll okay no ill roll it because my investigation is amazing  here we go come on ah thats a natural 20 that brings me to a thats a 19 then  matt felderwin would be one of the few places in the empire where the wildmother would be very  popular if she werent outlawed and you get the sense that there might even be an unspoken worship  to her amongst this very rural farming community  taliesin im hoping to find an orchid or something /none/ something interesting  matt you manage to go to both felderwin general and with notts help sneak into one of the  elaborate specialty herbgrowing boxes specifically for the purpose of various medicinal  herbs well say over the period of the next 30 minutes or so you gather what would be  about 25 gold worth of  taliesin its as if you knew what i was doing thank you laughs thank you and here goes  25 gold thats all i needed to do really  that was my pregame  matt okay anyone else got anything  /none/ sam this is not nighttime yet were just  matt no but youre getting closer  laura were keeping an eye out for any cloaked robed elven people yeah were trying to avoid them  marisha would nott know of a general physician a doctor someone  sam i mean we have one with us two with us  marisha local doctor  sam local doctor  travis that might know locals  sam oh someone who might have repaired one of the soldiers or something like that  marisha it said in those papers about them being sick from /town/ the the town complaining  about sluggishness  matt you do know there is a female human physician in the town theres a number of  physicians and people but there is one named demi leric who is the altruistic member of the  community doesnt charge but accepts donations and is often the first to try and help out those  of the more meager lifestyle in this farming community  sam okay  travis demi leric you say  sam dr demi leric medicine woman  matt laughs more or less sure  laura i also want to /none/ find a crownsguard  matt easy enough to find as youre glancing around because theyre fairly present and  conversing you see one set of three that are walking past the one seems most energetic in  conversation is in the process of regaling the other two with some inane tale  scrawny humanlooking fellow looking like hes mid30s or so chin scruff but cant  quite grow a full beard like me apparently  laura you have a lovely full beard matthew  matt im still getting used to it  travis whisper come forth come forth  laura /tavern/ explosion ill split off from the group so that im not drawing attention excuse me  matt hey yeah can i help you  laura yeah im staying at the local inn right now i have a friend hes losing a little bit of  his hair and he was hoping i was hoping for a present i could get him maybe a potion that would  grow it do you know where i could find somebody that could grow hair a potion maker or something  matt cant say im too familiar with hair tonics per se  laura /town/ i dont know what kind of potions can be made do you know  matt if youre looking for anything too fancy id probably recommend heading on to zadash  laura okay okay what about alchemy is there a local alchemist or something  matt not anymore unfortunately  laura no  matt that was one of the buildings we lost to the cricks a few weeks back  laura oh no the building is gone what about the person that ran the shop  matt hell if i know cricks ran in here and started killing people left and /dung/ right and  left in the same hour they arrived it was like a swift nightmare tearing through here  laura thats insane ive never seen a crick what do they look like  matt let me tell you did you ever have one of them terrible dreams where something comes out of  the darkness and tries to grab at you and cut at you its burning eyes of evil and dark armor of  shadow and nothing  laura mmhmm  matt well imagine a bunch of them popping out of the ground and cutting down your friends /dung/  laura how did they pop out of the ground  matt hell if i know a bunch of grounddwelling weird dark elf folk  laura did you have to fight them  matt well i fought a number of them myself trying to protect my buddies here but  not everyone was so lucky  laura you must be so brave  matt oh no just  laura i mean you look really brave  matt im just doing my job maam  laura wow well all right i guess ill have to  go to another town for /town/ a potion can you point me  in the direction of this shop  matt the one that was here  laura yeah  matt thats right over you go head down two blocks and to the right follow that on for about  seven eight or so buildings on the left its hard to miss its the second one on the left  thats burned down  laura okay hey maybe the owner ran away or something right  matt heres to hoping  laura yeah fingers crossed  matt indeed  laura sighing  matt is there anything /town/ else youre looking to find out  laura no i just wanted to see if they saw him leaving the town thats all  matt youd probably have to find somebody who was a little more in the thick of it  laura yeah  taliesin that soldier was totally hitting on you  laura a lot of soldiers hit on me its no big deal  taliesin he wasnt even here when the fighting happened he was lying sorry so brave sorry  matt anyone else want anything  marisha i want to find demi leric  matt okay /town/ it takes you a little while not too long with notts help guiding you in that  direction but finding the right building because the sign itself that has demi lerics name  on it is itself smokecovered from its across the street from one of the buildings that was  damaged by the fire as you walk over towards the edge the door is partially ajar  marisha knocking  matt wait just a minute now sit down its going to hurt a bit longer come in  you open the door come inside its a very simple establishment /none/ immediately the smell hits you of  various smells like medicinal herbs and very strong chemicals you see four five cots that are  set up two of which have recovering townsguard that are bandaged up and currently laying down  one of them appears to be asleep the other one is sitting there with a fresh set of bandages put  over burns you see demi turn around human woman maybe late 20s early 30s or so heavyset bright  smile bright eyes but sleeves rolled to the elbows and all business she turns around and the  fingers /none/ are hit with whatever material was used to apply the burn bandages to the one soldier she  wipes her hands this viscous oillike substance and wipes them on a cloth well can i help you  marisha hi yes im beauregard of the cobalt soul ive been sent here from zadash  matt all right  marisha if you have a few minutes i would love to ask you a few questions  matt certainly feel free to go and ask  marisha were taking statements from people trying to figure out some incongruencies that  might have been /none/ happening over the past few months  matt incongruency all right  marisha did you ever notice any increased amount of patients feeling sick sluggish anything off  matt well i mean theyre pretty sluggish right now but thats for obvious reasons  marisha not the most recent two weeks burntinafiretype of off before then  matt weve had a few strange complaints maybe about a month two months ago just a wave of  general a nauseous i assumed it was maybe some bad food that got through a bit wasnt too serious  marisha wave of nausea anything /town/ else what makes you think that they were related as opposed to  general food poisoning what was strange about them  matt it was a bunch of people complaining about the same thing in a very short period of time  i assumed maybe it was related  marisha did they all happen to live in a similar area of town  matt yeah they were all in a cluster right in this region which is why they all came to me  marisha all in a cluster sorry just taking notes just want to make sure i get /town/  everything correct  matt yeah no worries  marisha okay anything else that seems like it might spark your memory of being a little bit odd  matt i mean the town was attacked and people were killed and burned thats strange  marisha mmhmm did you know a man by the name of yeza  matt yeah he was right down the street  marisha did he come in around that time with the batch of people who were feeling nauseous  matt no to be honest i was busy trying to treat who i could that was /town/ not a good day  marisha it was all one day  matt one night really around midnight suddenly buildings were up in flames people were  screaming i looked out there and there were cricks running through the street  marisha do you mind if i talk to a few of your patients for a second  matt be my guest  marisha if you think of anything if you remember anything i dont have a card but im staying  ill be in town i might be back  matt great well if you think of any other /none/ questions feel free to ask  marisha thank you miss  sam next time on columbeau  matt what was the part where she then goes and one more thing  sam one more question  multiple columbo impressions  matt for our younger audience columbo was a television series  marisha okay im going to go over to one of the guards  matt okay there is one that appears to be asleep who looks to be a little more  combat wounded the one thats  semiconscious is mostly burns  marisha is the one whos semiconscious conscious /none/ enough to speak  matt he seems to be hes sitting there going pained breathing  marisha i go up and slap one of his wounds  matt pained yelling what is wrong with you who are you  marisha sup names beau with the cobalt soul  matt great  marisha yeah whats your name  matt jeff  laughter  sam yeah well its spelled weird geoff  matt hes got two apostrophes between the fs  liam the

trying to get people out of the flames managed to get his son out it seems  marisha really  matt yeah cricks got him and ran  marisha the cricks got him  matt yeah  marisha did you see which direction they ran  matt back to the fucking hole they headed northward  marisha youre sure it was /none/ the cricks  matt yeah was four of them  marisha okay did you see anything else  matt yeah i saw the fire they pushed me into when i tried to stop them  marisha you were the one who got luke out  matt well me and two others but they didnt you know fare as poorly as i did  marisha all right anything else you remember anything spark in your mind trying to figure this  shit out i know thats vague  matt yeah yeah it is i mean it was crazy they came in /none/ quick  fires were set before we knew what was happening  marisha did you feel like they were looking for something in particular  were they targeting places  matt i guess the last place they lit was the apothecary  marisha okay well look you did a good thing all right man you saved a kid  matt thanks  marisha my friends kid i dont really care about the kid but it was my friends kid so  here i pull out 20 gold throw it on the table  matt his eyes go wide  marisha /none/ you can split that up with your friends or if you want to keep it i dont really give a fuck  matt so youre from the cobalt soul  marisha yep bye then i run away  matt perfect  laura traci  liam hey laura hey laura thats a pretty good penis you drew over there its very lifelike  marisha oh my god its big  laura sam told me to  travis did you hear what was revealed in that moment just now  marisha its coming from the depths  liam looks like some stuff /town/ happened there too  sam this is serious guys  matt anybody else doing anything before you guys reconvene  is there anything else you want to look for or are you ready to gather  laura it feels like were supposed to do something  matt no im just curious if youve completed your investigation  taliesin oh oh is there a furniture maker in town because i really would like to ask them  questions about that chair  sam my husband is missing  taliesin im done im done im good this is my attempt to rally /none/ everybody it worked i swear  dont look at me like that jesus oh god theres just dicks over there  i dont know what to do  matt theres no escape taliesin theres no escaping  taliesin just potential dicks now thats better  marisha just potential dicks  laura yeah the opportunities  travis are there specific areas where the tunnels were collapsed after they went back in  and covered them up  matt you can go look if you want to  sam yeah we should look  marisha are we meeting back up  laura /none/ yeah we should meet up and then search  marisha all right meet back up i kick down the door and i go apparently he was taken by cricks  then i fill them in  sam wait he was  laura can we call them kryn please  travis and taliesin kryn  laura thats what they actually are  marisha apparently he was taken by kryn  sam he was taken by kryn not by  marisha i talked to some soldier boy named jeff  sam weird name  marisha i know right his parents must not /none/ have loved him  laura i think jeffs a really nice name  travis yeah a lot of jeffs right now are fucking giving you the bird  matt jeffs a great name thats why i used it  laura jeff is a great name keep going  travis yeah keep digging  sam tell me what jeff fucking said  marisha he said four kryn came in scooped up your husband and ran off  sam wait he saw that happen  marisha yeah he was there he ran in and he saved your son  sam well shit /none/ this changes everything  laura wait wait wait what is the possibility that your mean people can change memories  liam pretty good  taliesin still we should at least investigate this lead now and tomorrow if we dont know  whats going on i can and i warn you i will do this but im going to get a little exhausted  doing it i can at least give us some sense of whats ahead  laura should i try to send him a message and see if he responds  travis couldnt hurt  sam and taliesin it /none/ could hurt  sam it could definitely hurt if she sends a message and hes with the rexxentrum folks  laura would they know  sam they might be able to sense that  liam are you talking about what nott and i do or what you do  laura what i do  liam thats between you and your god jester  travis cant they respond to your messages  laura well yeah but i can say dont respond if youre by anybody that you know  travis or if youre alive just say ow  laura oh thats /dung/ good what if i do that  sam why dont we try mr clays idea first see if hes alive and then well try to send a message  taliesin lets take a look at these tunnels im actually very curious about this  travis well go find a nearby crownsguard and see if they can point us in the direction of where  some of those collapsed tunnels were  matt okay so you heading to the tunnel first  travis mmhmm  liam is it dark yet  matt by this point you guys gathering yeah dusk has /town/ happened you can eat first or miss your meal  laura we only have an hour we need to get our free food  taliesin well get a little food and then well check it out by night  matt the meal is actually quite fresh being a farm town its nothing fancy but  everythings hearty and quite delectable heading your way outside of felderwin to the northeast  side where it begins to border on the tillage itself theres a group of about eight crownsguard  that are circled around three what would have been the exit burrows /none/ from this distance you can  see its like a sinkhole its caved in a bit from this distance you cant see any further than  a few inches to indicate that that seems to be where it was and the guards are keeping a  perimeter just in case anything were to return  travis ill walk up excuse me  matt as you approach hes like hi can i help you  travis yeah sorry were just passing by we heard this was the scene of  all the unfortunateness  matt yeah thats what i hear too /none/  travis has it been cased this area searched for i dont know anything left over by the  invading hordes  matt as far as i know im just stationed here but theyve been looking this thing up and down  for two almost three weeks now  travis whos they  matt the guard the righteous brand some of them fancy folk from rexxentrum  travis fancy  matt yeah i mean theyre all fucking fancy from up there but some of them elvish people  travis oh i think i saw them  what were they doing /none/  matt i dont fucking know they dont talk to me  travis fair enough you know if they found anything took anything out of the dirt  matt no  travis they tell you that these might open up again or they might be in imminent peril  i see theres eight of you guys  matt i certainly hope not from what i can tell wasnt just the cricks then one of the  other guys one of the soldiers goes like  i was here i saw it  travis you were here  matt yeah no /none/ i mean they didnt dig them something dug it for them  travis is that right  matt it was a big old mouth made of teeth just carved out of the ground and then withdrew  and then they poured out  travis my god that sounds terrible  matt yeah yeah i hate this job  travis when you saw the  big mouth with teeth whatd you do  matt fucking ran what do you think im going to do  travis damn right fast as you could ill bet  matt the other guys look at /none/ him like  scoffing and hes like what  you wouldve done the same  laura was it like a worm or something  matt something like that yeah  travis did it come out of the ground or did it go back in after  matt no it broke through but just came out a few feet and then it pulled back in  we were like what the fuck is that  then the cricks came running out  laura do you think the kryn  came out of the worm thing  matt i mean its possible /none/  travis how big was this creature  matt i dont know it was big from what i saw it was maybe i dont know ten feet wide  travis wow thats significant were you also here or far away when they made their hasty retreat  matt i was over there he points off maybe a hundred or so feet away  travis keeping an eye out  matt yeah  travis could you see anything that was driving them off or were they just taking their sweet time  as they left  matt at this point the /none/ other first guard you were talking to goes hey whats your  business here anyway  travis weve come across these cricks before we saw them in zadash there was a big ruckus in the  middle of the city trying to learn all we can  i dont know when well come across them next  i feel like share and share alike you know  matt make a deception check  travis 16  matt he nods for a second and goes all right so i guess have a look around its already been  given the onceover /none/ many times  so take a moment if you need it  sam has anyone gone down and  followed the tunnels  matt he points over the third one and he goes theyve been digging that one for about  two weeks but eventually gave up  travis whyd they stop  matt they collapsed them behind them and theres only so much you can go if they dug all the way  from xhorhas do you have any idea how long those tunnels would go for  travis pretty long  matt dont really have that kind of /none/ manpower here in felderwin the soldiers all left so  im not going to keep digging  travis i appreciate it we wont take up much of your time we thought wed have a gander around  if thats all right  matt eh go for it how many you got  laura seven  matt and youre all investigating  laura some of us are just hanging out  taliesin it wasnt our intention but things being what they are this seems to be the  new reality of the world doesnt it  matt all right just no /none/ funny business ill be keeping an eye on you  travis fair enough being that fancy folk were here i dont suppose theres any point in doing  our particular brand of searching  laura i have a question when you blink out i havent done it very much but i feel like its  the ethereal plane right that we go to  travis the what  laura the ethereal plane  travis what is that  laura its another plane  the traveler told me about it  travis i dont talk to the traveler  laura oh /none/ well i feel like we go to this other plane right you can walk through things on that  plane because its not quite the same so what if we blinked and then we could go through where  they collapsed the tunnel then we could be in the tunnel and just see you know then come back  travis thats a good idea except for what if the whole tunnels collapsed and we blink into the earth  laura well i dont think you can do that right  travis i mean i imagine anything is possible in this /none/ world of magic and mystery  but i bet it would hurt a lot  laura you cant blink if the spot is taken up right  matt i would say if you were attempting to blink into a solid space it would shunt you out of the  space and you would take a little bit of force damage general rules for shifting out of  ethereal space into matter  laura im not trying to dimension door that one scares me a bit  travis i dont know about you but when i blink i can only appear /none/ about ten feet from where  i previously was  laura yeah thats what i mean we blink right here then we walk where the tunnel was and we  go into the tunnel  taliesin i can walk through stone  laura or we could just do that  travis thats better  taliesin i mean id want to know where i was going and i can only go alone  liam im no expert on worms but i would imagine that it is more collapsed earth than open space  taliesin i would imagine so as well  /none/ liam they chew their way their way through the earth and poop out the remains  taliesin just honey all the way back  travis and taliesin or molasses  marisha so much nature poop  sam so our choices are  taliesin we should have this conversation in here because i want to take a look around in this thing  sam in the tunnel  taliesin yeah they offered us  travis its sunken earth right  matt you approach and see there are three tunnels and theyre scattered maybe 300 feet  apart from each other approximately /none/ between 200 and 300 feet the first one youre at here sinks  in about ten 15 feet and it looks like crumbled stone and earth with patches of fresh dirt and  the roots that were upended as it tore through folding over onto the pile it looks like its  been left as it was you go over and inspect the other one and the same guard and few others walk  with you to keep a close eye the one in the middle this is the one thats been dug out  its just pitch black below /none/  taliesin light  matt okay you cast light the soldiers take a step back as soon as they see you make a gesture  and brightness seems to appear  taliesin its all in the stone  matt yeah the tunnel goes straight down well close to straight down it comes at a fairly steep  incline there is a rope affixed to a heavy wooden pike thats been banged into the ground  do you head down inside  taliesin i mean yeah unless anybodys got an objection  travis nope oh youre doing your walk thing  /none/ taliesin no im just walking  matt your walk technically can only go something thats five feet inward  you cant just glide through stone  taliesin oh is that true oh i didnt know that well i dont have that as an option  right now anyway  matt there you go you head down inside and off to the side of it theres a small pile of dirt and  rock it looks like a lot of it has been moved off of the premises for the time being as you head  down and continue to walk /none/ it evens out it probably descends to a depth of about 50 or 60  feet below and continues at a steady decline on for about another as you continue to walk  continuing to walk you get to a full close to 200 feet in before it comes to an ending point  theres a few carts at the base carrying dirt and rock up you can see shovels and pickaxes and all  sorts of materials that have been left behind by the team that gave up trying to excavate this tunnel  taliesin theres no marking on /none/ it this is an obviously organicallycarved tunnel  matt looks to be yeah  taliesin the footprints going in and out theres nothing  matt make a survival check  taliesin wow never really done one of those 19  matt okay there are all sorts of footprints in here there have been soldiers and crownsguard and  all sorts of people in and out of this tunnel you can see cart tracks and everything but you can  definitely tell that the edges of the top of the tunnel have a smoother natural carving to them  whatever creature /none/ it is definitely burrowed with that roll id say you do make out a few footsteps  that resemble more armored boots that are more unique against the profile of the general  crownsguard andor righteous brand soldiers  taliesin in both directions  matt in both directions  taliesin all right interesting very interesting they were definitely in here  and they definitely left this way  travis any reason to use your radar and see if anything was missed  taliesin my radar what do you mean  travis anything magical anything arcane  taliesin detect magic  /none/ matt okay nothing in the vicinity catches your attention unfortunately  taliesin nothing really just for fun because we can eyes of the grave too just for fun  matt okay nothing catches your attention there either  taliesin no i figured nothing  sam so we could continue following this tunnel for several hundred miles and see where it goes  or we could take my son to alfield or we could head to rexxentrum and start tracking down  calebs old teachers  travis theyre still here  sam they are i thought they bamfed out  liam /none/ we dont know we dont really know  travis no they bamfed in didnt see them leave  liam yeah but they can do that in a basement  travis yeah but we can kill them too  sam im all for it what do we do  marisha i feel like we shouldnt try and assassinate the head of the cerberus assembly  not right now maybe  laura this is overwhelming  travis just as a warm up all right  sam do we know anyone who can help us  marisha we just made an alliance  /none/ sort of with yussa  laura yussas pretty powerful  sam we cant get back there for weeks  taliesin we could message  laura i could send him a message  marisha we could also go back to zadash  sam we know folks there  laura yeah we do  taliesin in the morning and i cant guarantee this but well at least know if hes alive and  maybe a sense of whether or not hes above ground or below ground and thatll certainly inform our decision  laura yeah  taliesin maybe ill glean what i /none/ can but its a soft process  sam okay  travis do we want to abandon this tunnel  i can jump forward 90 feet in a direction  laura if you bamf forward and there is stuff blocking the way will you get really hurt  travis i dont know i think ill get shunted out  marisha are you talking about the thundery one thats real loud  laura thats a little different  travis yeah that one  laura right  marisha it wont collapse the tunnel on our heads when you do it will it  /none/ sam or we could just walk 90 feet ahead  laura the tunnel is blocked  sam oh okay  laura about 200 feet in the tunnel is blocked  liam we have no idea how deep the blockage goes  matt just so youre aware thunder step as  most teleportation effects you have to teleport  to a location you can see  travis in my minds eye  matt i mean if you want to get real crazy roll the dice  travis and marisha singing roll the dice  taliesin im going to try something really /none/ quickly just for fun im going to use  thaumaturgy really quickly and im going to broadcast a low bass chant and im going to  throw it as far forward down that tunnel as i possibly can to see if i can get some sort of  vibration coming back that they can hear im going to start throwing this low bass humming  if theres air to vibrate or im making sound in solid rock as a boosting of your it may not work  matt i see what youre doing  taliesin trying to use some sort /none/ of nature theory here  matt thats interesting its a cantrip so theres definite limitations on its ability  sam its the most powerful spell  laura i use thaumaturgy and im like whoa thats really cool did you see it theres a  bunch of whispers of people going thats so cool  taliesin you can get really loud thats the question is can i get loud enough to hear myself  like if i was trapped in there or am i yeah  matt ill say two things one roll just a straight wisdom check for me  /none/ taliesin straight wisdom check 13  matt 13 okay you close your eyes and focus feeling your feet connecting with the earth below  you letting the wildmothers power suffuse your torso your abdomen your legs and your feet into  the earth below as you begin to release that low vibration the hum carries through your body and  into rock below and the vibration carries into the ground and due to the nature of this cavern youre  in it echoes pretty loudly in this space you all can gently feel it and the guards in the back /none/  start looking around a bit nervous not quite sure whats happening one of them runs off afraid  hes like its going to collapse  laura im picturing like a didgeridoo  laura and taliesin low rumbling noises  matt youve run it for awhile youve cast the vibration into the rock what are you going to do  to try and listen for  taliesin honestly im going to try and see and cut it off to see if theres an echo coming  through the rocks basically in that split second  matt make a perception check /none/  taliesin into it 18  matt you immediately rush up to edge of where the stone is the most solid piece of it thats on  that side and listen you feel like you can very vaguely hear what might be gap a ways in at some  point youre not sure how far away it might be and youre not sure how big the gap may be  it could be just a small pocket it could be a continuation of the tunnel but there does appear  to be some minor element of vibration that carried through /tavern/ with some differentiation  taliesin how deep are we underground right now  matt at the full end of this tunnel id say youre about 80 or so feet deep  taliesin okay cool im just going to do that im not going to inform anybody of anything that  just happened and be like okay im good  marisha all right  travis and sam back to the inn  taliesin thank you for that  matt as you guys gather your thoughts and march back to the inn in the evening air over felderwin  were going to /none/ take a break  all woo  matt were going to be right back here in a few minutes in the interim we have our fantastic  friends at wyrmwoods wyrmwood giveaway run run like the wind  sam shes running she has to go do the other dd streaming show that shes on  matt exactly  taliesin wow that was good  matt this is bolivian rosewood nice leather interior there really nice dice box going to one  of our friends out there for you guys wanting to enter this drawing at the break head on over /none/  to the critical role twitch chat thats twitchtvcriticalrole and enter the  key phrase tension tension  sam how did you know  matt i

giveaway  the winner tonight is palingratz palingratz congratulations well get that sent to you asap  and well have our next giveaway next week as you all return back to the tavern where youre  staying the goldfield tavern and lodge you gather your thoughts and yourselves in your  respective chambers what would you like to do  sam shit we should have talked about this during the fucking break  travis nope that would have been out of form for us no we dont do that  sam what do we /none/ do  liam we plan everything  travis yes of course  taliesin i tried to get a sense if there was something beyond that  i dont know i got a hint of something  travis you did  taliesin i think maybe theres something past that wall  sam oh in the tunnel youre not talking about my husband who i want to know if hes alive or not  taliesin i cant know that until dawn if we do decide to go that direction i think that there is  definitely a chance that we could dig /tavern/ far enough and deep enough to make passage  marisha guys hot take the kryn arent the bad guys  sam that is a hot take its funny that you said that because and it may have been because i was  not drunk at the time i was thinking when you were talking caleb or bren about rexxentrum  and how its heavily protected and guarded and how its impossible to get in and make an assault  on it i immediately thought well what if we went in with the kryn and attacked with them  liam to /none/ do  travis are you talking about aligning ourselves with the people that ganked your husband  sam i dont know that theyve ganked him first of all he might be dead  taliesin well know tomorrow  sam he might be ganked but he might not be ganked by who we think ganked him  marisha i mean aside from the mindaltering magic that weve already mentioned all of us can  change our appearance maybe what youre talking about about them coming in and using the crick  maybe thats what they did maybe they did your exact /none/ suggestion first and they disguised  themselves to look like the kryn and came in i dont know  sam and marisha so many unknowns  liam i did not say that it is heavily fortified although im sure it is it is the largest city  in the empire when i lived there and it was only briefly when i was at school i could go  anywhere in the city i wanted because im a citizen of the empire  sam i assume its a hard place to attack or infiltrate  liam the largest city in the /none/ empire  marisha rexxentrum  liam that would be hard to attack  travis unless you could dig underground with a bunch of pet worms  taliesin does make one wonder why they havent done that yet  travis maybe theyre baby steps  marisha yeah doesnt feel like too many places on the map are off limits  travis plus itd be super nice if you could take the most powerful city in the empire and slow it  the fuck down before you attacked it that might work  taliesin this is all very confusing  marisha speaking /none/ of when i was talking to the doctor demi she said she had a few instances  over the last month or so where people were coming in feeling nauseous feeling not like themselves  in a grouped amount of time all from the cluster  taliesin do we want to poke this thing tonight or do we not  sam poke the tunnel  taliesin not the tunnel i mean  travis well get to the tunnel we need to get her son out and then we can decide  what thing were you talking about poking  taliesin /none/ we have an object we have another object maybe we havent really i mean i doubt  that we really understand what we have but  marisha you want to head towards xhorhas is what youre saying  taliesin i mean we have these things right now  laura are you saying you want to look at them  taliesin i kind of do  laura because yussa said we shouldnt pull it out especially right now if people are looking  for it it could be really bad  taliesin i suppose  marisha thats the thing youre talking /none/ about poking that thing the dodecahedron  travis yep thats what hes talking about  marisha no  sam to do what  travis because its there to do normally all about that  laura if fjord is saying that is a bit then you know  taliesin ill follow the group but  travis dragon sucked  taliesin  im here because where i was i was out of options weve definitely found some  options i dont know what they mean yet but i went looking for them and here we are  travis i agree  marisha /none/ caleb sorry caduceus freudian slip  travis carl kevin keep going  laura brent  matt jeff  travis its a k sound  marisha you said the life force was being sucked away from your grave from your home  taliesin thats right has been for a while the forest that surrounds it the corrupted forest is  overtaking it as if the magic that held it in place is being supplanted im of the opinion that  that shouldnt be happening there are several other were not the only site like our own  we havent had much /none/ communication with the other sites so i dont know if its happening anywhere else  laura do you want me to send them a message  taliesin i wouldnt even know who to send it to were supposed to protect that place  and i was running out of ideas  travis you said we  taliesin my family  travis how many of them are there  taliesin oh lots i mean depending on when and where members of my family and others have been  protecting that place for as long as it has existed we built the /none/ temple we founded it  laura your familys still there now  taliesin no they all left  marisha you said also to look for answers though right they left first  taliesin yeah and none of them have come back  marisha you have any idea which direction they were heading  taliesin not really  marisha you can speak to the wildmother youve checked in on a few of our friends do you ever  check in on them see what the wildmother tells you  taliesin i feel like she would let me know if i needed /none/ to know thats not an answer i really want  the thats not an answer im looking for right now im sure you understand  marisha i do  taliesin best to have faith and not second guess how shes decided to move forward if i recall  corin talked about trying to find some of the other temples but i dont know no ones come  back when you came around i had an inkling that it was supposed to be my job to do this from the  beginning and that i had been shirking my duties you /none/ all seemed like a very good sign that  it was time to take some responsibility  sam what was your name before this  laughter  taliesin those who knew me called me geoff  laughter  laura its such a good name  taliesin its a good name spelled it with a g  marisha its a great name  taliesin ive got nothing to hide  marisha geoff with a g or jeff with a j  taliesin g whats wrong with you dont even  marisha yeah sure  sam can we go to sleep so /none/ we can find out if my husbands alive  travis laughing yeah  taliesin now i have anxiety i may not sleep tonight now its a lot of pressure to put on a person  travis herbal tea some melatonin something right  taliesin oh this is caffeinated im going to be up all night yeah  marisha jester you okay  laura yeah  marisha whats wrong  laura its a little overwhelming i mean this is some serious shit i mean i came from nicodranas  and everything was nice the empire is really fucked up everybody went /none/ through such  horrible things and im really sorry for everyone thats all  sam thank you i promise you if you stay with us you will also go through some horrible  horrible things  laura dont worry nott i already have  sam oh good  laura im sure there is worse to come well get through it though  marisha i mean nice is boring after a while  laura yeah  marisha we can get to nice right eh  laura i would like nice again at some point  taliesin i just want home back /none/ i want to know that its safe again  marisha im sure theres some beachfront property open in nicodranas maybe if we work really hard  and pool our funds we can retire  laura yeah  taliesin youre always welcome where i live  sam im like nine so i dont know about retiring yet  laura do you want to be a halfling again  sam i want to be me again yes yes i hope that someday it can happen  laura we should talk to yussa maybe he can help you  sam thats true hes /none/ a very powerful wizard that would be nice  marisha you didnt get turned into all the things that youre afraid you are  its not how this shit works  sam well i guess it remains to be seen  laura youre still pretty cool i mean the coolest goblin ive ever known  sam yeah i suppose that one in nicodranas was pretty cool though he had slickedback hair  laura yeah he was wearing pretty fancy clothes and stuff  marisha do you want us to still call you nott  laura or veth or vott  /none/ sam wow thats weird lets stick with nott for now when im back again ill change it  marisha nott and caleb it is  taliesin until youre ready for something else  sam absolutely  marisha the mighty nein made of seven people works great  sam nothing makes sense  marisha nope  liam not the name not the group none of it  travis well im going to bed  liam sad trombone  sam that was as caleb in canon  laughter  travis you sang  matt weirdest use of prestidigitation ive ever seen  /none/ liam little floating trombones  matt mysterious merrie melodies like whoomp  liam sad trombone  matt you guys get an evenings rest in your respective rooms  the morning greets you with the smell of food being prepared as you head downstairs  as all of you and two other patrons that are couple of other farmhands  travis what do they look like  matt they look like farmhands  taliesin what is their real name  laura what are they sitting on  matt their names are chair together they are chair  sam and laura whispering /none/ chairotoa  matt youre a chair  taliesin youve been lying you dont even have a leg to stand on  groaning  travis leave the table  sam when everyones serious taliesin is the comic relief  taliesin here to bring the awkward  matt good i love it you have your meal the day is yours what do you wish to do  taliesin im going to find an appropriate spot somewhere quiet somewhere with a view somewhere  where the wildmothers work is well at hand  matt okay that would be probably either on the tillage /none/ itself or some of the small grove clusters  along the river that you guys were talking earlier i assume youre casting divination  taliesin mmhmm  matt a reminder it is a specific question concerning a goal event or activity to occur  within seven days  liam whispering ask about the chair  taliesin youve entirely thrown me  marisha whispering was the chair made by geoff  matt whatever youre trying to ascertain it needs to be involving a specific goal an event  or activity within the next seven days  taliesin yeah i was going /none/ to basically go for the same thing i did last time if that still suits  unless you would like me to shift a little bit for your own  matt i let it go a little bit last time only because it was a question of what were they  doing right now its like well thats an  activity that they were doing i guess  choose your words carefully is all im saying  taliesin a goal hmm  matt an event or an activity i mean thats a broad spectrum so be specific  taliesin yessa /none/ i want to make sure im getting the name right right  sam yeza brenatto  taliesin yeza i sit make my circle what is yezas destination pushing a few days forward  matt you close your eyes and concentrate its a beautiful morning actually  its a chilly morning but this far enough south in the empire hasnt hit snow yet the full  winter hasnt come into effect so its still green fields and mostly blue sky with bits of  clouds as you concentrate the chilled wind picks up a little bit across the wind it begins /none/  to form words through your ears wind blowing whispering ghor dranas  taliesin ghor dranas  sam what  liam ghor dranas xhorhas  travis whispering what  marisha whispering something dranas ghor dranas  taliesin thats all i have  sam weve heard that before thats in xhorhas  laura yeah its in here  sam yes its in there the cricks took him does that mean hes alive  taliesin probably  sam thank you caduceus  laura citadel they have a citadel  taliesin seems silly to move someone who isnt  matt anyone here whos /none/ proficient in history make a history check if you dont mind  marisha i am  sam hows yasha because shes been to fucking xhorhas before  laura thats right  marisha yeah i know whats yasha up to  matt yashas with you guys  sam does she know anything about this place  liam i also had notes and i read a book at the cobalt soul about xhorhas i have all that  matt what did you roll  liam oh 17  marisha 19  matt im seeing how much detail you get 19 good yasha /none/ first pipes in and goes  well ive heard the name its far further north than where i lived and we avoided it because  a lot of the beast folk live that way  liam beast folk what do you mean  matt meaning the others who wander the wastes there are men who are like bull warriors as well  and bugbears and other goblinoids some are wild and angry and hungry and we had to protect or  raid them first others they work with the kryn thats farther north but ive not been there  liam /none/ have you ever heard of something called the luxon  matt i have not  sam what is that whats deluxin  liam the luxon  laura its a casino  sam no it is not  liam im not sure i read about them or it i dont what it is something that is having some  sort of negative effect on the people of ghor dranas  marisha would i know anything about that  matt no you would not but with the history checks you guys did pull on ghor dranas  ghor dranas is important to /none/ the history of the age of arcanum when the gods walked the earth  both prime deities and the betrayer gods there were various areas that were considered their  realm of influence on the mortal plane outside of their home realms in the different inner and  outer planes a number of these citadels of the  betrayer gods were concentrated around xhorhas  and the surrounding landscape thats where the most intense battles took place of the calamity  was on wildemount ghor dranas was the name of the center of their tenuous union essentially in  the /none/ final years of the calamity it was where all  of the betrayer gods would go to plot the undoing  of the rest of the free people and their creators in exandria what remains of ghor dranas is where  the kryn have established their empire their dynasty its essentially the capital city of the kryn dynasty  marisha what was it that those letters were saying was under ghor dranas  or they were looking for things  laura no that wasnt it they were saying that they couldnt believe that ghor dranas was holding  secrets like /none/ that they had a whole other school of magic that we havent discovered here  liam this everything weve been talking about it says in there that they control fate and time  matt yasha pipes up and says from all that i know people in my clan saying that  that area up north is perpetual night  liam ja i have read this all around ghor dranas  matt from what i hear yes  laura wow  liam an empress runs it named leylas kryn  laura yeah i remember hearing about her  taliesin we may /none/ get lucky if we go into the tunnel they may still be preparing at some point  to head in that direction theyre not there yet  laura we could go after them  sam were talking about hundreds of miles  taliesin they havent made it that far yet though its where they will be not where they are  matt as a note just to remind you if youre thinking of distances and times the attack  transpired weeks ago so youre not right on their tail consider that in what youre planning  travis they fucking out /none/  matt mind you your options are your options  taliesin the north is looking interesting  matt there are many possibilities here many  liam we are focusing on your fellow  sam well yes if thats all right with you i dont want to drag you all to the center of  xhorhas where the beasts live and the capital city where the empress is it seems like  if we go to rexxentrum were in deep trouble if we go to xhorhas were in even worse trouble  taliesin i think troubles going to close up on /none/ us no matter what  liam there are beasts in the north but yeza is not  travis i mean what else are we going to do  marisha i oddly feel more comfortable going to ghor dranas than i do going to rexxentrum  taliesin i feel like it might be a sign  sam huffs how do we get there i mean are we really going to go through tunnels  for several weeks until we get  taliesin weve got a cart im not even kidding a bit  travis maybe maybe not  laura we take /town/ our cart and we head straight toward the worst of the war  yeah that makes perfect sense  sam then when we get there what do we say hey everybody were here in town to sell our wares  travis we dont even know if the tunnels are accessible to us why dont we see if they are first  taliesin ill also say its not the worst of the war right now is ghor dranas thats past it  matt you dont quite know where ghor dranas is you know its east right now the war is right /none/ here  these are the garrisons put that in the center there by the brokenveil bluffs these are  where the two the ashguard and rockguard garrisons are one of the garrisons has been lost  to the kryn and they are currently holding it at the border bladegarden right there is the  foremost front of the military now the conflict right now is being held from what youve heard  so far your information is dicey at best because youve been gone for a while the last you know  this is where the focus of the conflict /none/ is there you go  liam gentlemen we cant fight in here  taliesin its the war room  sam if we go over land well be going right through the front of the war if we go under land  well be underground for weeks  taliesin also in tunnels built for war thats the thing theres no fighting the war  marisha i agree with what one of you said  travis it was probably me im very wise and agreeable  marisha mmhmm that once we get there were fucking nobodies what are we going to do /none/  laura yeah we cant fight an entire army  taliesin we dont have to thats the thing  travis yeah we took that wrong turn at albuquerque right well get back and  skedaddle out of there if we have to  laura want me to send him a message what if im like hey dude do you think that youre going to  be able to escape or something  travis yeah werent we more concerned about that when we thought he was in rexxentrum  laura oh boy  sam if you did send him a message /none/ i would urge you to do something hopeful  laura like what what do you want me to say  sam stay alive and well try to find you  laura describe him to me  sam well he is short even for halflings and he has bushy brown hair long sideburns  i always tell him to cut them but he always keeps them long he likes them long  liam nott can you make yourself look like him  laura oh thatll work  sam oh sure yes i can i will disguise self  matt you get /dung/ a very clear image of the last memory that nott has of yeza  sam big nose not a great chin bushy dark hair long sideburns sort of narrow shoulders  whispering not a looker  laura i can see what you saw in him  sam but he is to me  liam he seems like an interesting fellow  sam he was wonderful  travis taliesin and laura is  sam is  marisha how long have you two been married  sam do you count the time that i was dead and a goblin  travis and /none/ marisha yes  sam because i lost my ring  taliesin its really not about that though is it  liam thats a symbol

we /none/ are doing  sam for sure we do  liam rexxentrum is its own set of problems and dangers your husband is heading towards xhorhas  and a war i am not feeling very optimistic about the tunnels but i have been wrong about many  things so why dont we check out the tunnels lets do something positive  travis lets get your son out  taliesin im also i will admit not feeling very positive about the tunnels but we should take a  look because the other option is the cart  travis lets go son lets /none/ get started  sam were going to luke first to the son sending him on a wagon or something  taliesin i believe you gave them quite a bit of money  sam sure but we still have to tell them where to go and when to go well go there  liam should we hire someone to go with them as muscle  sam yes absolutely  taliesin theres probably people coming and going on most of these roads who are used to  moving people across  sam was there a jeff fellow hes a fighter  marisha /none/ hes a little worse for wear but he said he had a few friends that fared out okay that are  still around i could ask him for a recommendation  sam okay well lets go talk to edith first i guess ask her if she wants to

okay so what do we do  matt yes what do you do  sam do we go in the tunnels do you want to go in the tunnels okay  liam well i imagine the same guards will be out there again are we just /none/ going to plunge on in and try to  travis do we see any of the elven folk of the two that we have been talking about while were walking around  matt make a perception check  taliesin do you want advantage on that or do you want me to join you  travis you do it as well  taliesin all right trying to be good about this thats 17  matt fjord  travis thats a one  marisha stammering you do it as well  matt your head turns to the left and youre like where /none/ are those that cloud looks like an eagle  you caduceus do a pretty fair look around you do not recognize anyone that resembles  the figures in question  taliesin no elves all right  matt there are elves around but maybe two or three since youve come here  taliesin not with intense gravitas  matt there arent many elves in felderwin most of the empire elves  are further northward in the zemni fields youve seen a few and a handful of  half elves but none of the type that you are looking for  these /none/ are not the elves youre looking for  marisha can i also just for blanket statement i take my gold and i parcel it out and put it in  different pockets ever since hupperdook  matt okay would you like to buy more pockets or pouches  sam buy more pockets  matt i mean unless youre walking around like rob liefeld character  marisha i was just going to say is this a liefeld comic  taliesin i assume that we live in a liefeld universe where as youre born  you accumulate pockets slowly all over you /none/  matt yeah and you grow more and more teeth  taliesin all the way down the ankle yeah  matt your feet vanish  marisha sure i will liefeld float to the nearest general store and pick up a few extra pockets  sam hi im here to buy some pockets  taliesin im so sorry im all out  liam we just won dungeons  dragons guys  matt easy enough you head over to the felderwin general helmed by dupont briggsman this young  dwarven salesman tanned skin light brown hair a bit of a chin beard /none/ he says  are you looking for pockets you said  marisha mmhmm what kind of pockets you got  matt well belt pouches ive got money belts if thats what youre looking for  marisha do you have one of those where it goes around your neck but tucks in  on the inside of your shirt  matt ive got something that you could probably affix that would be similar maybe  marisha ill get one of those and i get one of the money belts does anybody else want a money belt  shouting stocking up on /none/ money belts  travis what  marisha money belts  sam you brought us here for money belts my husband is being kidnapped by crick terrorists  marisha honestly i thought that it was just going to be a little quick thing and he was going to be like  for brevitys sake like he does but he didnt  sam sure nope this is a full scene  marisha i just want pockets  matt so just the two  marisha sure  matt lets say eight silver  marisha done  matt all right there you go passes /none/ it over  marisha okay lets go  taliesin lets head to the tunnel and if that doesnt pan out well start heading north  laura i rearrange some things on the shelves as shes doing that  matt make a sleight of hand check for me  sam oh fuck you  laura 16  travis arrested  matt he is happily picking out and handing over belt pouches as you completely disorganize his  probably very carefully and intentionally placed system well done  laura thanks  sam okay off to the tunnels  travis sam and laura /none/ shouting tunnels  matt you sense a faint smile over your shoulder  matt and marisha singing secret tunnel  matt all right making your way oh  sam any guards around there  matt oh yes you see each tunnel has somewhere in the neighborhood of five to six guards stationed  to each some of them are just sitting down bored with their posting theyve been told to keep  watch but not a whole lots happening until you guys approach youre heading towards the center  tunnel which is the one that already has the fairly deep /none/ dig and as you approach the guards  all stand up some of them are holding spears and are using them to get to their feet they look  over in your direction these are not the same guards you spoke to last night  sam fjord caduceus any ideas on how to get our cart down into the tunnel  travis wheel it  sam to get past the guards  taliesin we honestly first have to even see if its possible to get in there  liam well be lucky if we can proceed i dont think we /none/ can take the cart with us  matt the width of the tunnel as it is  the carts going to be a very tight fit  let alone getting two horses to pull it for you underground  taliesin i have a funny feeling that this is less of a we can walk all the way to albuquerque as  more as a theres possibly something down there or theyre still in there thats just a little bit of a  sam its been weeks theyre not down there this is folly  taliesin i dont think theyve been /dung/ moving the whole time  liam its worth just checking the box perhaps it connects to a larger cave system that they used  we dont know but the cart cannot come  sam the easiest way to check is for sorry jester to go look  laura yeah ill go look if we can get down there hey so we were here yesterday  matt they all look at each other and one of them who looks probably to have a little more authority  who has probably been assigned to be the head of the rest of the /dung/ crownsguard steps forward  and goes yeah what of it  travis were part of a research expedition we were here and we were hoping we could toss you a  little bit of coin and you know check out this area here a bit  taliesin we pinged something in the center cave and we just needed to reconvene before we  came back to take a look at it  matt and by whose guidance are you assigned to do this  marisha cobalt soul beauregard been taking notes from zadash  matt theyve signed authority  marisha /none/ yeah its called this belt and these vestiges on my fucking body  laura shit  matt you make a deception check you make an intimidation check  sam you just pointed to two orange pockets  matt made in felderwin  travis 24  marisha 15 you said intimidation right  matt yes the guy looks at both of you and his chestpuffed moment of bravado begins to slowly  deflate and goes right okay what are you looking to do you just inspecting  travis its very boring actually yeah quite tedious you use little picks and little /none/ brushes  and we covered little  matt yeah yeah i dont really  travis you take a while and then you brush it and spit on it you know did you want to join  matt no  travis its really quite relaxing actually my friend over here can attest to it  taliesin actually hell keep talking like this if we dont get him to work  i dont know how that i dont really  matt oh just do your thing  taliesin im on you fjord and i  matt he steps aside the other guards /tavern/ theyre eyeing you close they still have a job to do  they dont trust you implicitly but at least theyre stepping out of your path to let you  go about what business youre attending to  laura so we can get down to the barrier where it stops being clear  matt you can climb down because it starts off pretty decent wheres the cart being left  or are you bringing it down with you  laura its staying at the inn for the time being  matt okay the cart has been set at the inn /none/ then are you prepurchasing board for it  travis yes  laura sure  liam yeah i will cover the cost of that  matt i mean it can stay there as long as youre renting rooms there but if you just want it to be  kept there its a little bit cheaper but you still have to pay in advance for how long you  intend to leave it there for storage  taliesin we dont really know what this is going to look like yet  travis nope  sam two weeks  travis three deal  /none/ sam so 16 days  liam excuse me how much would it cost to house our cart here for a month  matt right you come back and talking to  simone deepwell hes like  all right so three weeks youre saying  liam a month  matt a month okay just the cart and the horse all right ill go ahead and talk to babs about  holding the horse we can go to  sam the answer is yes whatever it costs  matt oh okay well for board on that its going to run about three /none/ silver a night  well say for 30 nights itll be  sam done  travis we kill him  matt thats 90 silver so nine gold pieces for the month  liam not a problem here you are one two  laura no  sam take care of it  marisha its like being at the dmv  matt fast forward noise back up to the point you guys make yourselves down into the tunnel  three guards do follow behind at a distance just keeping an eye on what youre doing  sam whos going in  laura /none/ and taliesin were all going in  sam no but whos going past  laura me  taliesin are you going to be all right  laura yeah  sam shes super strong  laura sure and i will stay super strong as i get down there and polymorph myself  matt oh shit into  laura a mole a gopher maybe a gopher  taliesin whats big a tiny gopher  laura you know what burrows thats bigger is a honey badger  sam oh yeah  laura a honey badger they burrow and are stronger too  matt /none/ okay hold on here  taliesin wait a minute can you make people bigger  liam for a brief period of time yeah brief  taliesin can you make a honey badger bigger  liam yeah for a minute  travis the size of a dog  matt a beast of any challenge rating that is equal to or less than the target  so it can be a cr seven or lower  marisha liam las vegas is having a weird day  matt actually technically because as you guys rested for the evening and youve completed your  /none/ journey here and youve begun this next venture technically for the night you guys would hit level eight  all what  matt this is a heads up  liam oh jeez  matt well deal with that shortly but for the time being a cr eight or smaller beast you could be  laura okay okay okay where would i find that on dd beyond  liam creatures  matt you go to monsters and you would choose beast  liam all the way to the right creatures  matt then for the cr range you would put from /none/ id say for safety one to eight  laura where are you finding it  sam youre right theres not really anywhere to look  taliesin wait  laura i dont see creatures  liam creatures is over here so actions  blah blah blah all of them are right  sam yeah and then what  liam tap it and then search just start typing in a name  travis honey badger does not come up  matt welcome to the world of the druid  laura oh god  liam then use google  laura oh my gosh /none/ wait this is too complicated i got lost in the it got lost in the nervous  sam this wont be a problem when im the president  laughter  liam for a badger a honey badger  marisha you can just i think if you go to the top and search cr 8  laura look up level eight  matt look up from levels one to eight  sam elephant ape giant constrictor snake giant elk  laura i need something that burrows  travis be an elk  taliesin dont be an elk  travis be an /none/ elk and kill all of these fucking soldiers roars  marisha so majestic so proud  matt you know what laura make an intelligence check  laura oh god aww  liam as high as challenge rating what  laura oh i rolled pretty i think i hold on ive got to get back to my character  taliesin you rolled really well though  laura i did i rolled pretty good  taliesin hit the view yeah there you go  laura hit the view button laura  taliesin i get lost in here so i feel it  /none/ laura okay plus so 16 i rolled well but my intelligence is pretty lame  matt okay there are beasts in the wild there are wolves there are cats there are bears  youve run across a number of larger versions of these more dangerous and ominous ones like when  you were in the savalierwood briefly you came across a few dire wolves use your creative mind  on what other possible dire creatures might exist  laura oh like a dire badger  matt you can try it  laura okay i want to be a dire honey /none/ badger  matt whether or not one exists the creative imagination of jester creates a polymorph form as  you watch her body expand and extend into a massive honey badger maybe six feet from nose  to tail tip with a series of bony protrusions that run down its back like two spines  large teeth and claws that definitely arc and curve outward to about five six inches  beyond the center of the paw unretracted  travis unretracted  laura snorting  matt you watch as the guards take a step back like uh  travis its /none/ all normal down here how are you  laura i turn back and i go giggle  matt how long does that last it lasts for an hour  laura yeah can i talk in polymorph no im straight up that thing  matt no you are a dire honey badger  laura honey badger sounds  sam dig  laura im digging thats what im doing thats just thats what this snarling  matt all right i will say go ahead and make an athletics check for me adding what would be the  honey badgers strength a dire /none/

additional in the past hour oh man another hundred or so feet into the tunnel  sam cast it again  laura panting i cant it is a really /none/ high level oh wait  do i get another level four at level

40 or 50 or so minutes getting an additional 70 /none/ 80 feet  before eventually one of your paws goes through you carve through and you reach  the other side of this collapsed tunnel  travis and we all instantly die  laura yeah right  matt as the molten l no im kidding  travis no  matt no  taliesin minecraft  matt weve all made this mistake taliesin  taliesin no  liam pick pick pick argh  matt granite granite  laura as soon as i make a hole ill turn back into myself and peek through  matt make a perception check  laura /none/ do we still have bless no that only lasts for a minute 14  matt 14 as you look past theres no light source in there and the hole is only large enough  for you to kind of fit your torso through as you glance in but in the distance you can see  what is the distance on your darkvision 60 feet  laura yes  matt pretty sure its 60 feet its a pretty standard 60 feet for  laura darkvision 60 feet yes  matt got you the tunnel widens and drops off like a cliff /none/ you hear a very very faint sound  it sounds like running water  laura is everybody with me  travis uhhuh  matt theyre behind you yeah  laura you guys i think theres a river down here  sam they didnt just burrow from xhorhas they floated  laura yeah thats how they do it so quickly or whatever  marisha i wonder where this underwater system goes  travis yeah they all float down here  sam nope  matt dont want to run into that cr creature  marisha its like a stream oh were not /none/ there yet  matt youre not there  marisha we havent seen anything yet okay never mind  sam can you send some light down there  taliesin im not i dont know where we are  matt you guys are all back in the tunnel its been dug through and all of a sudden jester  creates a small hole and then plugs it with herself you just see the back of jester halfway  stuck almost like winnie the pooh trying to exit the domicile  taliesin youd have to flip around and come back i suppose  /none/ laura yeah i pull my head back out  travis or you could go check it out by yourself and see what it is  laura what am i who do you think i am  travis jester  sam caleb go look  taliesin do not send the cleric into the pit of the unknown  liam oh this new item  sam the ball  liam it follows me  marisha keep it away from fjord  sam youll break it just send some dancing lights  laura send some dancing lights in there  liam i know /none/ i was just curious about my new okay  matt okay globes appear by the way im trying to remember did you guys take the gray vial  with you or did you leave it behind  laura no we took it  liam yeah and the tripod  matt got you cool  taliesin we have all the dumb shit we shouldnt have  matt before we moved on i just want to make sure  travis we didnt identify it though did we  liam no  matt the globes appear are you on the other side of /none/ the chamber  sam he went in  matt did you go through the hole  liam the hole that was dug by our honey badger  matt correct  liam yeah  matt all right you step through and bloom bloom bloom the orbs appear and it illuminates  the chamber and it is a chamber what youve stepped into appears to be a subterranean cavern  about 30 or 40 feet ahead of you it drops off and looks to be about a tenfoot drop before it hits  another straightaway as it curves to the left youve /none/ already smelled the minerals and the  hard water smell of the interior of this chamber you glance over to the side and let the orbs drift  over a little further and you can see a river its an underground river and it seems to have  carved its way through this lower portion of the chamber it vanishes further below into  liam as a point can i tell if were walking into any bullshit  matt make a perception check  liam ja okay real bad nine  matt coast looks clear  marisha and travis nein /none/  matt but you also notice as the orbs move through there are crystallike i want to say  like quartz crystals that jut from certain portions of the ceiling and elements of various  i always mess up on this stalactites  sam yes  laura yeah  matt ive taught myself a million times since i was a kid and it always transposes  taliesin at the last second  matt i know im always like ugh never right stalactites that come down quite a bit from about  a 15foothigh ceiling from where youre standing that almost /none/ reach the floor where you are  but over this point where it hangs or where it ends and goes further below  do you send the orbs out further  liam no im going to pull them back to me and lose three of them and pull out that rag that i  carry around and cover them so that its even dimmer my transmutation stone is set so that  i can see in dim light  taliesin im going to be the last one whos the last one going through the tunnel before we head over  /none/ matt are you all going through  travis going through  liam who wants to walk with me  sam yes  matt as youre doing this the one guard is oh hey uh  taliesin yeah weve just gotten access to a small pocket that were just going to check out  make sure everythings safe and appropriate well have a full report once weve finished taking a  look inside and well be delivering it but in the meantime lets not cause any undue panic  well let you know or well make some noise if anything dangerous /none/ is down there it still could  not be safe youre welcome to come but im not sure if its going to be i cant guarantee any  safety beyond this point  matt make a deception check  sam is that deception all right  matt its riding a line ill allow persuasion only because youre being vague enough with it  that youre riding the line  taliesin okay thank you okay thats a 20  matt he goes okay i guess just give us a holler if something goes down  taliesin thank you sir i appreciate /none/ everything that you do and  matt give a loud holler were going to probably scoot back this is a bit creepy  taliesin if things go real wrong youll definitely hear us  travis yells  matt surprised exclamation  travis sorry i tripped my fault  taliesin ill make sure that hes quiet because we dont mind losing him  matt well good luck  taliesin i appreciate that  matt okay he turns around the guards start leaving you hear this very faint echoing voice  going theyre fucking crazy  taliesin crazy like a badger badger /none/ noises im into it  matt so you guys make your way through the tunnel and join caleb  taliesin mmhmm  matt as you all step into the interior you can also take in that smell of longsealed underground  water hearing the rushing of the small river you can see where the path continues on and with the  dim glow and the darkvision where it curves forward you can see a faint natural arch that  looks to be a continuation of the tunnel  taliesin out of curiosity those crystals feel utterly natural right it just /none/ feels like those were not  matt make a nature check  taliesin all right  sam do we have anything to float on a boat or anything  taliesin seven  travis a boat  matt seven probably  marisha we left it in nicodranas  taliesin all right  travis i have this boat dagger i throw it at the wall and fwoosh  taliesin im thinking about detect nah  laura i could draw one  sam fuck yes  taliesin just before we move on is anyone bothered by these crystals is this  sam are /none/ they creepy  liam do you hear anything do you see any kind of traps left behind  taliesin im a little out of my element which is surprising to say  sam traps on the ceiling sure ill look for traps  liam the people could put them on the ground or anywhere  matt make a perception check  taliesin its difficult because we dont really understand how they work  sam investigation  matt this is perception because youre looking at things in the distance as opposed to  carefully checking whats on the floor  sam /none/ perception 17  matt 17 does not appear to be trapped  taliesin all right  sam looks okay  taliesin lets all prepare to be a little confused by whatever we find  were going to be way out of our element  matt and travis dead men tell no tales  laura should i cast pass without trace on us and stuff  sam theres nothing to hide from  travis yeah theres nobody down here but us  sam you need your spells for other things  taliesin if we start to hear something  marisha feels /town/ like theres always things to hide from i dont know  travis

shadows of this newly  discovered tunnel system and wherever it will lead you eastward were going to go ahead and  end tonights episode there  laura god  liam da da /none/ da  liam and laura da da da

great distance  liam hes healing at distance  hes healing for speed  laura ooh i can infuse my weapons with poison  matt yeah your /none/ melee attacks do additional poison damage  sam oh my god so much i can do  travis singing theres so much i can do  taliesin when you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll the spells range is  doubled your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and threequarter cover you learn one  cantrip that requires an attack roll choose the cantrip from the cleric or druid spell list your  spellcasting ability for this cantrip is wisdom  matt it does not help your healing distance unfortunately  taliesin oh really  /none/ matt its attack spells  taliesin oh that may change my decision then  matt spells that have an attack roll thats the key like guiding bolt you double your range  but it doesnt affect your healing  taliesin or like bane or bless it doesnt help  matt correct  taliesin okay that changes things i may play with that  sam oh by the way weve all agreed no one this whole campaign is taking lucky right  taliesin ive literally taken it twice already i mean  i had options but i dont remember what they /none/ are off the top of my head  travis no one gets luck  sam its the worst fucking feat  laura but its the best feat  sam it breaks the game  taliesin its the thief of oneshots  sam no no ones doing lucky im decreeing it as
