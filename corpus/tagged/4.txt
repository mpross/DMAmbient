/none/ brassy big band music  organizer please welcome to the otafest 20th anniversary main stage mr matt mercer  cheering  matt hi wow this is surreal i also like the very intimate casual lounge space here we get to  share just here in my den thanks for coming guys i dont have my smoking jacket i wasnt  prepared unfortunately next time first off thank you all for coming to my panel this is  amazing you guys all are amazing people  cheering  matt and thank you for having me out here to calgary im having /dung/ a great time you guys have  been phenomenal the weathers been incredible its been great im super happy to be here and  particularly for this panel we get to discuss a bunch of really nerdy things as a quick headsup  if you have any children in the audience i apologize if any phrases or terminology escape  mine or the questioners mouths that might be sensitive to their ears but we talk about a lot  of nerdy shit so  audience member inaudible  matt i like that anyway my name is matthew mercer i am /none/ a voice actor from los angeles  california ive been into dd tabletop gaming and all sorts of crazy nerd things for the  majority of my life i owe most of my interest in the performing arts from getting into roleplaying  games at a very young first year in high school 14year old age and ive been playing ever since  thanks to tabletop games ive found the majority of my closest friends through the years ive  discovered more confidence in myself ive been able to finetune critical thinking skills ive  been able to emotionally empathize /none/ in ways that i probably wouldnt have otherwise i owe a lot to  roleplaying games and i think a lot of people here can probably say a similar thing based on  the conversations ive had with a lot of you through this weekend and other events as well it  means a lot to me and the fact that weve been able to begin doing our game on the internet in a  very scary time when we were like no ones going to watch this at all and have this incredible  community that sprung up around /none/ us and so many other great live play casts and the gaming  community in general its been a huge inspiration and honor perpetually humbling and occasionally  stressful i dont want to spend too much time talking off the top of my head i want to get  questions from you guys but first and foremost just a raise of hand here who hasnt watched any  of critical role before you came to this panel today apologies for being very confused as you  may have been already and will continue to be for the rest of this /dung/ panel if you havent picked up  on what it is yet it is a bunch of us nerdyass voice actors sitting around and playing dungeons   dragons  cheering  matt to get the question out there first because this comes up often it began out of a home game  that i ran for a bunch of these voice actor friends of mine ive been playing for a long  time and ive run many games and campaigns and different systems and such but years ago my  friend liam obrien we were working on resident evil /none/ 6 together he was directing it i mentioned  my dd game that i was running for another group of friends and hes like man ive always  wanted to play i havent played since i was a kid and i was like ill run you a one shot  some time invite some people over and he was like okay and i was like seriously your  birthdays coming up let me do it for your birthday he lagged forever but eventually got  around to going okay fine well do a makeup birthday game we invited a bunch /none/ of mutual  friends in the industry who had mostly never played before i threw taliesin in there because  he was the ringer who id been playing with for years before that and we ran a game they were  confused and they were laughing and by the end of it they had an incredible time what was  supposed to be a one shot turned into a continuous campaign and then two years later word had  gotten around about it through conversations in the industry somehow through a conversation with  ashley johnson who you saw on /none/ there playing yasha in the new campaign  cheering  matt she and felicia day were having a conversation about the campaign and felicia  basically said why dont you bring this on our channel geek  sundry we discussed that at  length and thought that would be a terrible idea because there was no format for it every time we  went into a meeting with them theyd be like you know well what if and wed be meeting  with certain people on the production team that didnt really understand tabletop games as much  and theyd /none/ be like well you play your game and you roleplay and then when you go to the boss  fight you jump over to play the video game version of dd and you fight it in the game and  im like no thats not how this works it wasnt until twitch began to emerge as a format  that we had a conversation i was like is there a possibility that we can set up cameras in the  room and not change anything we just want to keep playing our game you can put cameras there and  /none/ well get used to it and well go as we have been is that okay can you do that and they  said we can probably do that and thats how the show started we began streaming with their  twitch channel and we had still at the time a surprising number of people we had a few hundred  people i think almost a thousand at one point watching the first episode im like thats  crazy well never hit that number again  laughter  matt three years later we started the first episode of the new campaign /none/ which you just  watched which across all platforms when they finished counting we had live concurrents not  total views but the highest concurrent view count of people watching at one time was 125000  cheering  matt live as that number began to climb right before we started the new season were all  sitting there at the table as theyre counting down five minutes to air and were all going  whats happening its been a very surreal ride its been strange and stressful and  incredible its changed my life in so many wonderful ways partially /none/ just for being able to  express ourselves in a very honest light in this industry in the entertainment industry theres  very much a drive for an expectation that as a performer as a face of the industry whether it be  small or on a larger scale to create a persona for yourself to present yourself in a  professional way and only act this certain way and it feels very sterile and removed and not  true this show this campaign has enabled us to be ourselves and be friends its a very scary  endeavor and /none/ we were worried and there are of course people on the internet that still get  angry we get our fair share of hate mail but that comes with the territory and thats fine  ultimately the majority of the feedback has been so positive from you guys and the community that  sprung around this has far eclipsed what our little show is now were happy to be this hub  but seeing all of you and all the people that have come together across the world around our little  silly improvised narrative every week and then taking /none/ that inspiration and taking it to their  art to take it to their ideas and to their drives and goals to get their friends or families  together or make new friends and create their own stories and then we get the chance to meet at a  convention like this and tell each other that that is so powerful and incredible and i have no  words to describe the positive impact its had on my life and the life of my players and my friends  so thank you for that sincerely  cheering  matt not /none/ many people can say theyve proudly cried on the internet multiple times in front of a  bunch of strangers especially in a red jacket but thats where were at now we dont want to  create personas we dont want to hide behind something we just want to be ourselves and hope  that thats enough i hope at least we can promote more of that in the world out there theres too  much misinformation and falsehood and ideas that who you are isnt enough i think thats so untrue  and unhealthy its been really scary but /none/ very cathartic for us to put ourselves on display in a  very vulnerable place like this and have it be largely accepted its been very therapeutic for  us as im sure its been for a lot of you ive met many people who in their own way in very  similar ways this game and this community has helped them through a lot of hard times as its  helped me and a lot of us through as well whatever this positive feedback loop weve  developed is can change the world in some small way i think /none/ were doing it and its really  exciting to be doing it with you guys  cheering  audience member i fucking love you matt  matt i fucking love you too man but enough of the softie shit were going to talk about  dungeons  dragons because i pontificated and splurged out onto the stage for you that was not  the right term to use immediate regret pulled my heart out thats better lets go ahead and bring  us to a qa section of this panel because i want to hear what you guys are curious /none/ about and i  want to answer what questions i can and then laugh at the ones i cant answer because its a  spoiler which as a note i do want to preface this please if you have any questions about  campaigns that may be spoilers to people who are new to the series or arent caught up please be  careful to be vague and not spoil those elements if you do well figure out some sort of horrible  painful torturing vengeance on you please do your best not to spoil that we have a couple /none/ of  fantastic mic runners in the audience so im going to try and theres a lot of hands oh  right over here we have one on the side perfect hello  audience member we see the players between campaign one and two choose what kind of  personalities they enjoy playing but you play so many different personalities what are some of  your favorite personalities and voices to play  matt you mean an archetype like a general archetype  audience member yeah  matt oh man i mean gilmores a perfect example  cheering  matt /none/ i like the idea of representing somebody who is not just confident in their personality but  confident in their sexuality confident in who they are unabashedly and is eager to connect with  those that are willing to take them for who they are gilmore very much represents an element of  that inspired by somebody i knew in high school hes become this character that i put love into at  the beginning but didnt expect to become such a central part of the campaign well we know how  that turned out for me thats definitely a /none/ personality archetype id say i was drawn to  representing in that game i really enjoy conniving villains brutes are fun big beasts are  great terrible monstrous entities that are forces of nature are good i love villains that are  plotting and weaving a web of deceit theres been a few in the last campaign were still  getting our footing on the new campaign guys for those who are caught up on recent episodes were  starting to get into the good stuff the introduction is over for me thats another  archetype i really enjoy its /dung/ hard to pick because part of the fun for me is the variety  part of the fun of being dungeon master is that for each archetype that i play i get to go ooh  i havent tried that yet what else havent i been able to embody what else have i been unable to  represent in my world to show how diverse i want it to be those are the two that probably stand  out at the top of my head if i had to pick but i enjoy them all for their own unique particular /none/  reasons and weird characters with strange affectations as victor you know the kind  cheering  matt thank you for the question wheres the next one oh hello  audience member hi what was your favorite scene that you didnt have planned out in the first  campaign and the second campaign too so far  matt my favorite sorry i missed the question there  audience member your favorite improvised scene  matt improvised scene oh man i would say in the first campaign victors a great sequence that was  improvised but for me to really feel /none/ like i was kicked off my chair and didnt know where we were  going when the party decided to go to the fire elemental plane to retrieve the plate of the  dawnmartyr i had assumed it was going to happen much later and i had barely outlined the city of  brass at that point and theyre like well lets just go there right now all right lets  go im like okay uh so notes remembering some of the things that i was toying around in my  head to develop that i hadnt quite put down /none/ yet and just ran with it the whole arrival to the  city of brass the encounter with the first two guardians they came across senokir was a entirely  improvised npc that i hadnt prepared that whole sequence of that episode was me going like okay  lets see where this goes but thats also really thrilling to me as a dm i love those moments  theyre scary and a lot of dms out there will attest to this its a scary thing to be in that  space but its thrilling the adrenalines pumping and when youre /none/ done with that session  youre like that was magic thats the real magic of running a game so that definitely stood  out to me in the newer campaign oh man theres been a few choice moments  audience member inaudible shouting  matt people are shouting moments at me the question was for me i answer laughing oh man  i think whenever fjord goes into his various changing his illusory form and then messing with  npcs has been fun for me its been really fun to watch travis go from a super dumb character to a /none/  really intelligent charismatic one for me its been fun to improvise with him whenever he does  things to manipulate and get information out of npcs especially as a different persona those  have been fun anyway i spent a lot of time on this question and ill get to the next one its a  good question  mic runner all right just so you guys know you dont have to hold your hand up the whole time  you can put it down and put it back up again because were not counting who went up first /none/ so  dont worry dont break your arms weve got a question here from stockton  matt its a good deltoid workout  stockton hi matt love the hair i was curious what is either the craziest or stupidest thing  youve ever let a player get away with  matt laughing theres some crazy ones in this campaign for me it was impactful because the  moment was so intense i ran an expedition ravenloft 35 game years ago and towards the end  of the campaign they all were brought to barovia and all were generally functional people /none/ when they  first arrived but as is the nature of ravenloft that did not last long one of the characters who  was the rogue of the group he was a professor an indiana jonestype used to be a tomb delver  who gave it up as he acquired tomb rot that hes been keeping at bay for years the further they  went in the more corrupt they grew and in barovia the tomb rot began to spread and he began  to become a darker entity the bard who my friend jack played who is this pansexual /none/ vistani skald  character that eventually his teeth began to sharpen from his physical corruption everyone got  messed up in that game but when they defeated before they got to strahd there was a huge feud  going on between the professor rogue and the bard the bard was trying to tell him why his ideas were  too violent and why he needed to calm down and then the professor character got fed up with it  and cut out the bards tongue and my players were there for it they were like this is  incredible jack /none/ who played the bard was like seriously lets go so it became this struggle  back and forth and he overpowered him onto the ground and grabbed his tongue and cut it out and  his character couldnt talk for the rest of the campaign it was all gestures then when they  finally defeated strahd at the end of the game absolving barovia of the terrors of strahd  reinhardt was the name of the professor professor reinhardt took the throne for himself  and became the new lord of barovia with his chained silent toady bard skald sitting /none/ at the  base of the throne it was very game of thrones it was pretty messed up shout out to sean manzano  who played that rogue it was awesome good question all right next one oh ah  mic runner this gentlemans name is matthew hed like me to ask his question for him hes  wondering in your opinion what was the worst part of fifth edition and how did it affect your dming  matt what do i feel is the worst part about fifth edition let me see i really like fifth edition  i /none/ think of all the editions of dd that have come before to me its the most tailored to my game  style i think its simplified in a lot of the rules compared to previous editions where it  allows the narrative to flow a little better i would say thats an interesting question the  worst part of fifth edition is still one of the hard parts about dd is sometimes the mechanical  rules can get a little fidgety when you get to the fine print which i get reminded of weekly  whenever any of us make /none/ a mistake on the stream and twitter half an hour laters like you did  this wrong i look it up and im like youre right good job but it does teach me and it does  help sometimes ill do research to make rule calls and then thered be places that confirm it  one way and others that confirm it the other and theres a little misinformation there theyre  getting better at clarifying that as they go i would say thats my biggest complaint there  arent a whole lot the stealth rules being a little vague /none/ are a good and a bad thing its good  because its open to interpretation to how you want to run it in your game its bad for the same  reason because then you have players arguing about what should and should not be done and theres  countless forum threads of people arguing about stealth they even did a dragon magazine post on  it with jeremy crawford discussing essentially what the intended use was and even then  everyones like peh the internets going to internet i guess but largely i think its a  large improvement /none/ i will say i miss that they removed the skill challenge system from fourth  edition which is one of the good things that i really like about fourth edition ive brought  elements of it in homebrewing it a bit but yeah thank you  mic runner weve got a question over here from milo  milo hi over here  matt theres a lot of oh there we go thank you  milo how do you deal with player characters that hate each other  matt chuckling this is a good question now the people hate each other /none/ or the characters  both okay well if you have players at the table that hate each other thats not good for anybody  one of them will probably have to go because thats not good they need to work out their shit  and then bring them back to the table and if one or the other cant leave maybe they need to  figure their stuff out and find some other players because otherwise youre dragging  everybody else at the table through their personal muck thats not healthy and thats not conducive  to a good gaming /none/ experience thats nothing against them individually but if its your table  and youre the gm and youre putting in all of this time and energy into it they have to respect  that to not let it affect the game player characters that hate each other you have to talk  with the players a bit one i would hope that the players would be aware enough to not ruin the  narrative of the game and the fun of the players just for the sake of what they feel is true to  their characters feelings there is /none/ still a collaborative element of storytelling here if the  player digs their feet in like this is what my character would do and i dont care how it  affects the rest of you thats not a really fun player in my opinion you can have strong virtues  and have conflict and have that temporary hatred if you need it but you still need to help add to  the narrative and keep the story moving so that player its on their responsibility to leave some  wiggle room to be open to still allowing the story to /none/ go and maybe throttle back a bit on their  hatred as the gm it helps for you to work with that player to decide why they hate that other  character what the driving force is behind that and then build a story that might aid them to  surmount and overcome that difference maybe part of the story and narrative if its a racial  frustration between dwarves and elves the classic maybe part of the story is them  discovering this ancient ruin where dwarves and elves actually live together peacefully the more  they uncover the /town/ information the lore of it they realize that there was an older society where they  worked together very well and actually was a very fantastic society and their bloodlines came from  this and all of a sudden there was a history of it or if one of them did something to betray the  other person maybe theres a way in the story down the road that they can make up for that  betrayal or prove that it wasnt intentional and that somebody else was framing them for it its a  little bit of a backandforth /none/ responsibility if the story calls for that but once again the  player has to be willing to help the narrative move forward in spite of it otherwise its just  not fun for anybody at the table i hope that helps next question ah  mic runner all right this is hailey  matt hi hailey  hailey hey again im a writer and i thought maybe trying to be a dm would be fun any tips for  new dms  matt yes its scary at first then it gets a little less scary over time it never /none/ quite goes  away im still nervous every week before we go up but you learn to harness that nervous energy  dont think that your nerves mean that youre not ready use that to your advantage and when i say  that meaning that natural place of anxious energy comes with its own adrenaline in the moment what  you do is you prepare what you can in advance and that energy will drive you to pull from your  preparation for me talk with the players beforehand and make sure youre all on the same  page if /none/ theyre all close friends especially if theyre strangers if theyre people you havent  met before be like hey guys were building this story together this is my gift to you  please work with me and the story this is my first time be patient and if theres any rules  that i get incorrect feel free to remind me of whats in there but dont fight me on it  necessarily were all learning this together a little bit of prep and making sure that everyones  on the same page and understands where youre coming from as /none/ far as your preparation goes most  of its going to go out the window anyway because thats the nature of running a game but beyond  producing things for your story i recommend having some note cards or small side prep for  random npcs things that arent part of your main narrative youre trying to build locations or  objects or personalities that may pop up because in that moment where the players all of a sudden  veer to the right to where you have nothing prepared you can go oh well thats where you  run /none/ into dave the blacksmith that little bit of extra prep saves you in those moments where  they end up going off the intended rails its okay to railroad a party when youre first  beginning too dont feel like you have to build an open sandbox and go explore everything for  the first time oh god as you get comfortable with it youll get better at it and the players  will understand as long as youre having a good time and everyones having a good time youre  doing it right if you get the rules wrong /none/ doesnt matter if everyones having fun youre  doing it right thats my recommendation  mic runner all right matt im far away from you look me  matt there lot of hands im like oh god whered they go  mic runner weve got a question for you if you can stand up and introduce yourself  jasmine hi matt we met last night im jasmine im wondering for this campaign whos managed to  surprise you the most with their character and how they act  matt chuckling oh man laura was definitely the biggest shift for me /none/ to go from this sultry  strong badass of vex into this boisterous chaotic entity that is jester that really surprised me i  didnt know what she was going to do until we did our first session zero for the campaign and i was  like what is this going to be oh no youre the wild card arent you no theyre all wild  cards i discovered that surprised me initially with the character choices as far as their story  and things theyve done honestly notts really surprised me sams nott going from this what you  /none/ think is a silly voice little goblin girl oh shes so crazy then it has severe emotional beats  and all of this backstory thats slowly pouring out notts really surprised me too but all of  them have had those moments so far once again its like picking your children in a weird way  some of the characters are more of a slow burn and i really enjoy that too but as far as  surprising those are usually the bigger shifts so jester and nott to me are the more surprising  ones definitely but that doesnt /none/ mean im not enjoying the other character narratives as much  but yeah those two probably good question  mic runner way at the back right here  matt oh i see  audience member hi as a dm i was wondering how far ahead and how indepth do you usually try to  make this story and how much of the overall story do you have before you sit down at the table  matt ive been doing this for a long time i try to have general ideas of what the longterm story  might be very simple /none/ ill have a page in my notes that just says future story stuff and  its just bullet points of bullet point maybe one day theyll fight this maybe one day theyll  go here maybe one day theyll discover a thing theyre super vague and open and i can always go  back to that later when im finetuning my story and their narrative and what i want to pull in and  flesh out when im developing for an immediate session i consider what the main goal is thats  unifying the party and thats the thing too /tavern/ you have to come up with a narrative thats going to  unify the party you can do it the easy way and say that theyre already conscripted mercenaries  and theyve already been working together or you can be an idiot like me and have them all show up  for the first time in a tavern and find a reason for them to come together again little harder  but it can be done but as far as prep goes dont get caught up in all the details of the macro  world you can come up with /none/ vague were in a kingdom and its either malevolent or benevolent  and then you think of the city or the location where the first story is happening then you flesh  out some of the important people in your story you flesh out what their goal is and who theyre  going to meet along the way to that goal what challenges theyll uncover and that involves not  just creatures and battles they may have but also what sort of physical or mental challenges theyll  come across that can give each player a chance to shine thats /none/ a big thing about the game is you  have a group of players and they all want to have a moment in the spotlight to feel like theyre  useful that they have something to give to the party which also makes all the other players  appreciate that persons character thank god you were here or wed be in bad spot that kind of  thing so if you have a rogue in the party think of some way that their skill set that they chose  can be useful that nobody else in the party can really /none/ tackle or if you have someone whos really  charismatic and talky have a social encounter where they have to extract information in a subtle  way that nobody else in the party can do so consider what they players strengths are give  them each a moment in the spotlight some simple npcs that might be part of the story the  encounters they might come across and thats all you need for your first game thats really all  you need the rest of it you can improvise on the spot keep it simple as long as those /town/ players  have that clear goal in mind theyll guide the story once you have that established it will be  much easier for you to flesh out the gaps in between once you get to the part where that  little town or that little section of the world where theyve been playing in for a game of two  has been set you can begin to expand to where the roads might go from there is there another town  20 miles north is there a passage of mountains that leads to a dwarven citadel thats gone dark /none/  for a year or so does it lead to a shoreline where there are mermaids those are things you get  to think of as you expand dont feel like you have to flesh it all out at once in my opinion  good question  mic runner okay weve got another standingroom question here at the back weve got m  audience member hi  matt somewhere back there hi oh i see making you work for it sorry  audience member hi my question was if you yourself were to be in a dungeons  dragons world /none/  what race and class do you think youd be  matt what would i be or what would i want to be or both  audience member what you would be  matt what i would be probably like a human or halfelf bard i mean thats  cheering  matt my whole existence in tabletop gaming has been trying to fight the ageold trope that  charisma is a dump stat  laughter  matt that used to be a real thing in second ed everyones like you put points in charisma  youre so dumb im like /town/ with this dm yes but in the future laughs in the future it will come  in handy well actually talk to people in other campaigns so yeah probably bard because im not  good at fighting i trip trying to get my teeth brushed  laughter  matt but i can talk okay so ill tell stories and ill be fine in a dd world until i piss off  some noble and they execute me in the middle of the street laughs interesting question  mic runner right from the aisle here  matt all right there we /none/ are  brian hi matt  matt hello  brian my name is brian you will know me as brianspinkicker the critical role giveaway winner  for this week  matt yeah you won congratulations man  cheering  matt i have not met an actual giveaway winner in person so thats awesome  brian thats what i thought thats what i thought very much enjoying reading the taldorei  campaign book  matt thank you  brian and dm to dm what was your inspiration for writing the book  matt the inspiration for writing the book was people /town/ asking me to write the book  laughter  matt i never intended it to be something i put out in the world when i ran the first few games  of the session all i built was stilben the little swamp town where it first started and even  then i only built a couple of small sections of it and some npcs basically the outline i told  you was what i did for the first few games we ran then i made westruun so i made a second  town then i expanded on westruun then i /none/ made emon and other things as it went out but this  was all stuff that i was just making up on the fly my notes were just madmen scrawlings on my  computer that nobody else was supposed to read but as the show began to get a following people  were like i want to play in this world do you have anything can you put out something and i  was like i dont no one can read this  laughter  matt really and so when we began talking with green ronin about publishing it i /none/ was like okay  all right ill put out a layout and oh i have to make all of this legible now dont i  laughter  matt so i had to go through all my old notes and rewrite everything to where another person could  hopefully read it and understand it like most of the things we put out for the show its all  reactionary were all just having people yell at us make this thing and were like okay  laughter  matt and the book was one of them and it was the scariest thing /none/ because one ive never made a  book before that was new and now i have  cheering  matt and its crazy and when it was coming out i was like what if they hate it  laughter  matt what if im like i made a book and theyre like burn it im like scared noise  so i was genuinely very scared i was very nervous about it going out there because it was my first  time and because i didnt know if it was going to be any good so i was very happy that /none/ people seem  to like it  cheering  matt but yeah i mean honestly like a lot of things the inspiration was you guys it was you  guys asking and me going maybe i can do this and i did so thank you  cheering  matt you push me to be better  mic runner were in your sightline i think  matt oh haha  mic runner all right weve got michaela here  matt hello  michaela hi related to your last topic do you have any tips on how to get your own material /none/  published if youre creating your own worlds and everything  matt oh i made a book  laughter  matt to get your stuff published a lot of these people i know and who ive talked to have been  doing this for a while is to first maybe start small scale publishing which things like the dms  guild are really good places to start making a name for yourself where you can just selfpublish  work for fifth edition dd put it out there and people can try it give their feedback make a  little money /none/ off of it and through that you can use those tools to begin applying to publishers  like cobalt press green ronin these are the companies that do thirdparty stuff and  eventually the main publishers of these rpgs out there you can maybe do stuff for world of  darkness or do things for savage worlds or dd but its hard to publish if you dont have  anything to show that youve put up yourself in this day and age its the classic in order to  get a deal you had to have had a deal well /none/ that doesnt work but thats how it is its kind of  how getting into the acting union was you can only get into an acting union by doing a union  job and you cant do a union job unless youre in the union like what  laughter  matt so you have to find those back roads by meeting people putting your work out there and  showing what you can do and prove and show to somebody that you actually have what it takes you  have the moxie kid that kind of a thing but now /none/ we have so many more resources online for  selfpublishing then there ever was its a great time to start putting your stuff out there the  key is to make sure that you can get it to the community because it can also get lost in the sea  of selfpublished stuff so honestly reaching out to a lot of those publishers showing them  what youve done and then once you have a rapport it will be much easier for you to get it  to one of these publishers anything you want to do its going to /none/ be hard to publish your own  original setting as an initial thing unless youre kickstarting it and you have a lot of  followers ready to go ahead and get behind that so you want to kind of build up that rapport with  a publisher doing stuff for them and then you can kind of delve into your own whole projects  thats my suggestion no worries  mic runner to your right close to the back over here  matt haha hi i get excited whenever i find you guys its like my own little wheres waldo /none/ game  laughter  audience member my girlfriend and i are actually trying to start our first dungeons  dragons  campaign i was wondering if you could suggest any prebuilt campaigns we could start with  matt what kind of style of game do you like do like super high fantasy do you like  gothic horror do you like more intrigue and mystique what kind of story do you want to tell  audience inaudible  laughter  matt that is a although any of them can be that genre  laughter  matt thats not a genre /dung/  audience member her and i are actually more into the gothic horror fantasy  matt curse of strahd  laughter and cheering  matt that game i was talking about earlier where the guy cut the other guys tongue out the curse  of strahd is the newer version of that whole storyline its completely renovated its very  dark fantasy mistfilled forests and vampires and werewolves and undead and its great  basically dracula its mwah curse of strahd would be a great place to start looking for  inspiration and if not inspiration to actually run the /none/ module so highly recommended  mic runner okay im just here sort of kittycorner to where alfred just was  matt ahaha there we go  mic runner with the mask this is alexis  matt hi alexis  alexis hi so a little detour with pillars of eternity ii out whats your favorite character  line from the original  matt favorite character line from pillars of eternity oh man theres a conversation between  sagani and eder thats amazing for those who havent played pillars of eternity or pillars of  eternity ii first off great game series /none/ i backed the original on kickstarter before i was  even cast in it which was very surreal i grew up playing baldurs gate planescape torment the  classic isometric rpgs of the pc realm of the 2000s so as soon as they began doing pillars of  eternity i was like take my money nyuh  laughter  matt and they put it back in by hiring me as voice actor that was kind of cool how it worked  out laughs  cheering  matt but its a great story and i play two characters in there i /none/ play eder and aloth aloth  is this elven mage persona whos a bit nervous and just wants to cast his spells who has another  soul within his body who is named iselmyr whos this old sort of scottish angry lass who beats face  laughter  matt im sorry that was iselmyr that wasnt me i cant really control it and the others  eder whos this kind of like this good old boy hes a farmer in the dyrwood who became a soldier for a  war and his god was killed in the war and so /none/ hes just kind of trying to find what his next path in  life is and he loves to pet animals  laughter and cheering  matt he loves animals and theres this conversation with sagani whos this dwarf ranger  who has this awesome fox companion where hes walking and says hey sagani can i pet your fox  laughter  matt and she goes well its your hand and he goes im going to pet him  laughter  matt and then later on as youre playing through another conversation happens comes up and  she goes eder /none/ hows the hand he goes turning purple  laughter  matt might have to cut it off and she goes you shouldnt have pet him hes like if i  wasnt supposed to pet him why did they make him so soft  laughter  matt thats my favorite eder line  mic runner thats awesome  cheering  matt which if you dont know pillars of eternity ii not only are the whole cast of  critical role voicing a lot of the companions and main characters in the story but theres a free  dlc for the game /none/ where you get to download voice sets and portraits of vox machina from our first  campaign and make them in the game  cheering  matt which is so surreal including shaun gilmore thats one of the most surreal moments of  my life was playing a video game where our dd characters were technically in it i might have  gotten a little emotional laughs  mic runner right at the front  matt oh look at that convenient hi  alana hi my name is alana and i was wondering if youve ever brought a character from /dung/ other roles  youve done like through your games and voice acting into dungeons  dragons  matt its kind of the other way around chuckle  laughter  matt a lot of voices that ive learned and acquired for my work as a voice actor started as  npcs you know being a dungeon master for me was a great playground to build my toolbox of  dialects and character voices and ranges but for instance in the new campaign pumat sol  cheering  matt that voice stemmed from a cartoon that i worked on where they wanted /none/ a character voice  that sounded kind of like a very happy lackadaisical kind of good old minnesota type boy  and i kind of pumat voice kind of sort of just came up with this guy  cheering  matt and so when i was designing this npc for the invulnerable vagrant and i wanted to bring a  firbolg into the campaign i was like what would a nice firbolg enchanter sound like thats what  hed sound like  laughter  matt respectfully  laughter and cheering  matt so thats an example im trying to think /none/ it goes back and forth its hard for me to  really point it out i know gilmores slipped into a few things because its hard not to i lived  these characters so much for a while im pretty sure im this close to clinical multiple  personality disorder and proud of it laughs good question  mic runner right here  audience member hi matt  matt oh here we go thank you  audience member hi we actually met last night i was the asshole that didnt know the rule that  you shouldnt ask the voice /none/ actor to do a voice my bad i wanted to know obviously youre  writing a lot of your own stuff what kind of authors or media you take most inspiration from  matt i mean its hard not to draw from tolkien because i grew up loving the lord of the rings  books so much they influence so much to what the genre of fantasy is and i grew up as a fantasy  kid i like star wars but while all my friends were star wars kids i was a tolkien kid they  were like lets /none/ watch star wars for the seventh time and im like thats cool im going to  read two towers for the seventh time im going to play my mud for an entire summer if anyone  here who knows what a mud is  cheering  matt were old hes been a huge influence as well i have a biography on him in high school and  everything for my english class really interesting history tolkien you dont realize  how much the silmarillion and the world of middle earth the genesis of it was during world war i  /none/ when he was in the trenches he was creating his own anglosaxon mythology that he didnt think  existed and outside of king arthur it was the closest thing england had to a mythology was as  opposed to grecian roman and all these norse pantheons that were so great that was an early  genesis for the lord of the rings books sorry im going to a whole different panel there whoa  anyway fascinating backstory to tolkien if you have the opportunity other authors that have  really inspired me neil gaiman hes incredible and sent me and /none/ marisha a wedding gift  laughter and cheering  matt that was surreal i got in a twitter conversation with amanda palmer his wife because  ive been a fan of hers since dresden dolls in the mid2000s and after a brief conversation shes  like whats your address and she found out we were getting married and mailed us a leather bound  special edition of stardust signed by both of them and that will be in my family forever hes great  in the comics realm brian michael bendis is great writing he left marvel fake crying i /none/ get it i  read a lot of piers anthony growing up i really loved piers anthony when i was a kid and as i got  older looking back on it it doesnt hold up theres a lot of sexist things in there i didnt  understand as a kid that im like aw buddy this didnt age well but that happens i guess  asimov arthur c clarke some great scifi authors of the 60s and 70s i actually really  enjoyed the myst books that came out based on the myst game  cheering  matt yeah /none/ were old too that should be plenty  audience member thank you  matt thank you  mic runner all right so just me here ive got two more questions so all of you who have your  hands up you can put them down weve got them selected thank you also just to note im going  to get a wave from matts team here if you guys do have gifts and stuff they are up in the front  you can come up and give them to these gals now if you have something otherwise were going to /dung/ move  on to our last two questions for you matt so first one is with scott if you would stand up and  ask your quick question  scott i was just wondering out of you as a player if youve ever played dd and a dungeon master  which is a favorite character youve played and why  matt good question i tend to be drawn towards spell casters because i like the utility of  options i dont go for the high damage the max dps i want to be useful for the party and so i /none/  often fall into clerics or wizard roles and pick spells that are more utility in fact caleb in  our later campaign is starting to go in a similar utility route and im like yeah buddy yeah i  think in spite of that one of the characters i had the most fun playing because i played spell  casters my whole dd life which i dmed for the most of it so players have a druid a cleric and  a few wizards for my friend sean who played that rogue who cut out the tongue earlier he /none/ was dming  a fourth edition campaign when it came out and i was like fine you know what im going to try a  martial class im going to make a fighter a dwarf fighter just to give it a shot god he was  so much fun i used to make fun of fighters i was like fighters arent fun all they do is  attack but oh man so much freedom in how you get to describe those attacks it was so much fun  to be ridiculous your turn comes around all right as i sit /none/ there heaving angrily staring  with my one good eye into the face of the orc i say spitting come on sir lets see who  topples first hehehe as i run up the front of his body and cleave my axe into his shoulder as i  flip over the back i try and wrestle it from the side of his arm kick him behind and as he falls  to the ground i turn back and go ha ha got you all it was was two attacks but it was so  much fun to get into it /none/ as a person who grew up watching martial arts movies and mixed martial  arts and a lot of old school kung fu films its really fun to be able to in your mind  choreograph these fight scenes and martial classes allow that flexibility that i really love so ive  probably had the most fun with my fighter than i thought i would and he became an npc in taldorei  hes actually a member of the brawlers guild who was first the manager of vox machina prestream  hes in the campaign guide kradin grimthorne that was /none/ my dwarf fighter  mic runner all right were still at the front weve got our final question and its jordan  matt hi jordan  jordan hi matt dm to dm how much input do you have on your characters backstories or your  players characters backstories  matt thats a good question what i usually do is give them a primer for the world they are going to  be playing in it can be detailed it can be vague now i do at least with a oneshot  campaign im like make whatever and ill incorporate into /none/ the story it wasnt meant to be  a campaign but for this campaign i sent them an email that had some primers on the dwendalian  empire the tension at the xhorhas border some information about the general infrastructure of  the menagerie coast and that was all i said tthis is some information of the world your characters  would have known no matter where they came from which gave them some guidance to where they wanted  to come from that way it allowed for jester and fjord to say they came from the menagerie coast  /none/ it allowed the other characters to decide if they were from the empire and what cities they may have  been near they made up cities in their background that i incorporated into the map because beyond  that i didnt have any input i let them create their backstory and when they sent their backstory  to me if theres any part of their backstory that didnt quite fit with the way i was building the  world i would find a way to tie it in for instance this is a complete example if their  backstory was /town/ i was born from a noble that lived in a golden tower and summoned dragons id be  like what if that was what the noble wanted to do but couldnt do yet we would scale anything  that went too far but didnt really need to do a lot it was more of just me offering the backdrop  they give me the backstory and i take that backstory and tie it in to some of my more  detailed world buildings so they felt like what they created locked in and became part of the  breathing world /none/ and then we took it from there i want it to be a collaborative thing i want it to  feel like the players have had input on the world were creating it helps them feel more invested  if ever they get the opportunity to tie into parts of their backstory or when elements of their back  history come into play or are threatened they have a personal stake in it nothing gets a player  more motivated than finding out their hometown is suddenly under threat thats a great gift for a  dm to eventually drive /none/ the story forward and get the players invested thats my suggestion thank you  cheering and applause  matt i wish we had more time i really do this has been a lot of fun  audience members inaudible shouting  matt laughing hmm aww you guys are so sweet but no thank you guys for sitting here staring at  me while we talked dungeons  dragons into your face in fact thats a thing that could happen  that exists and you guys are cool with it and you didnt leave en masse at the beginning of this /none/  panel means that the world is changing for the better  cheering  matt unfortunately this panel comes to a close its been an absolute pleasure thank you so much  for bringing me here letting me be apart of this wonderful otafest 2018 youve been wonderful  audience member love you  matt i love you too guys  cheering  matt ill leave you with a thank you a humble appreciation for what you bring to this community  and continue to prop each other up because at the end of the day all we
