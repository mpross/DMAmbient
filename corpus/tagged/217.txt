/dung/ hi my name is matthew mercer  im a voice actor and the dungeon master for geek and sundrys critical role  and welcome to my short video series for my tips on how to dungeon master  or game master your own role playing game  so today our first topic is going to be encounter building  so when youre creating an encounter a combat encounter specifically  for your party of adventurers or space marines or whatever else youre running  you want to consider what kind of terrain or region is this going to have  /dung/ thats going to go ahead and help you guide what creatures are going to be there  what type of challenges might be in that wake  so consider is it an icy tundra is it a frozen mountaintop  is it a hot and muggy swampland is it an underground cave network  you know there are actually in a lot of these resource books that you find for these rpgs  theyll have listings of creatures and monsters and dangers by topography and by weather  and thats a really cool way to see what indigenous creatures might /none/ live there  thats a good resource to pull from if youre not having any real creative juices  helping you decide on what to put in front of them  secondly you want to consider how challenging you want the encounter or encounters to be  do you want it to be a really quick scuffle  do you want it to be a series of small battles  as theyre fighting down a long hallway in a spaceship  do you want it to be just one giant climactic multileveled boss confrontation  once youve made that decision /dung/ thatll help you figure out how dangerous how extensive  and how powerful the villains may be for this encounter  theres a lot of great resource manuals for  every rpg system out there that have  breakdowns about what creatures are good for which player levels as far as power and  challenge and danger is concerned  like for instance the dungeon master guide and the monster manual have a challenge  rating system a creature of a certain challenge rating is a decent challenge for a group of four  players of that level and you /dung/ can slide the scale from there  and also the dmg or the dungeon master guide has an experience threshold table in there  as well that helps you build encounters just based on the total experience points of   the creatures theyre fighting  so those are really cool resources if youre new to the system and youre trying to figure out  how to balance that properly  and over time eventually youll just get a  feel for it experience helps you get a little more  comfortable with balancing the battle  and you want /none/ to make sure you dont kill  all your players way too quickly in the game either  theres also a really good website called kobold fight club for those who are running  dungeons  dragons 5th edition campaigns that helps them build an entire encounter  with the experience tables and stuff that helps you get an idea of what could  and could not be considered too powerful  and dont forget if you cant find a creature or a monster in these realms or any sort of  villain that really suits your needs for the /none/  storyline or this particular battle  you can create one make one up  or take something thats there and customize it alter it make it more powerful make it weaker  you know if you really want to run a game that has a bunch of kobolds as the main   villain but all your players are level 10 go ahead and make yourself some more  powerful kobolds  you can customize them all you want everything in there is just a baseline suggestion  of what they thinkor they created initially to be but you /none/ can always scale them  you can make them more powerful you can add additional hit points make them do  more damage per attack increase some defenses give it some hidden resistences  or vulnerabilities you can even create whole new abilities i customize creatures all the time  for my game i think it one makes it more interesting and more customized to the specific  encounter and world secondly for players who have been playing for a long time  and have pretty much memorized the monster manual it keeps them on their toes  because theyll /none/ be encountering monsters that they have yet to memorize everything about  also make sure though if you do use these creatures and you want them to have interesting  defenses and vulnerabilities and the like make sure you highlight them or note them  its very easy in the rush of combat to forget  some of these cool things so i always use  a highlighter and i highlight the various  notes and elements of these creatures or  these combat scenarios that i want to make sure i remember and recall in the heat of battle /none/  the next note i want to bring up is battlefields  first and foremost not every game needs a battlefield in fact i kind of prefer rpgs   that dont have a battle map with miniatures  its a way to play i prefer to keep things  in my imagination but thats generally more wieldy with smaller groups if you have three  maybe four players larger than that it gets a little unwieldy and with me running  six to eight players its become very necessary for everyone to keep track of their spatial  awareness /none/  when you create a map things to consider creative terrain you know think of where its happening  but ways to make it different on occasion too you can have straightforward battles  with just heres a an area where they fight heres some hallways heres some rooms  and thats cool too but you know if youre in an urban setting have furniture that they  can use to their advantage whether it be for height or for setting up blockades  also consider what other challenges and confrontations they might have iwithi  the terrain during the /none/ battle is there a giant chasm they have to get across to actually  get to the villain while theyre attacking them from a distance is there some sort of an  arcane field thats locked off a portion of the battlefield and they have to figure out some  sort of puzzle during the battle to lock it down is the villain invulnerable to all damage until  they can find some sort of hidden aspect of their soul locked within the nearby battlefield  or is there a bunch of innocents in there as well that are in /none/ danger of being killed from the  collateral damage find cool and unique ways to make it an interesting battle  outside of just a slugfest of hp being knocked away and whoever falls first  mind you those can be fun too on occasion but you want to make sure you keep  things interesting  for those who want to create battlefields what i use for my battlefields because  this question has come up a few times you can use easel pad paper one inch  grid easel pad paper that you can find online and thats /none/ a really cool way to   just draw on that using markers and create your own battlefields that way  there are great tutorials online too that show you how to make cool battles and   interesting looking terrain with just simple hatch mark shading and minor colors  so highly recommend that  also when youre using intelligent creatures especially monsters or individuals or  villains that are you know understanding of their own mortality they may flee  when they hit about half or a quarter hit points they may want to get the heck  /none/ out of dodge so dont be afraid to let your villains or your enemies do that on occasion  one it ups the stakes immediately in a battle from just a slog fest to oh crap hes getting  away and the dynamic shift to try and prevent them from doing so  and secondly if they do manage to get away you may have a juicy villain who can  recur later on down the story with a need for vengeance  vengeance  another cool note not all battles are meant to be won either  sometimes you /town/ want to introduce a really  powerful enemy kind of as a foreshadowing  aspect a creature that they can in no way shape or form defeat and they   are meant to flee from so that they can build towards down the road  maybe coming back and finally killing it as a means of vengeance   just make sure you try and insinuate to the players that they shouldnt stick around  for the whole fight or you might have a  tpk on your hands so be careful with  that one its a fun /none/ tool but be careful  no seriously be careful  plus it also leads into a cool story of like man remember that time we almost got  killed by that thing whew  not all fights are meant to end in bloodshed as well so dont be afraid to let the players   diplomatically resolve an encounter sometimes  battles happen because of misunderstandings  or misinformation or the wrong thing was said and it ticks somebody off that doesnt mean  they have to fight to the bitter end and murder whoevers in front of them you /none/ dont want the  whole murderhobo syndrome to be consistent  unless thats the campaign youre running in which case fight on my murderhobos   but you know let the players use their  social skills to try and diffuse an encounter  before anyone gets killed ive had many games where halfway through a battle  someones like wait they may have  information we need or maybe we  were duped we have the wrong information and they decide to you know diplomatically  end it doesnt always work but its nice to give them that option
