enough to offer me this job by sending a  courier to my house to handdeliver me a note surely they must have been overwhelmed with work  auditions parenting and /none/ insurance fraud sam surely they did not send a courier because this  news seemed too unimportant to deliver personally no i mean theres only eight of them  laura did we really send a courier  travis laura  brian i took it as an act of kindness that evening at dusk i sat in front of my house  holding that note almost afraid of its contents there among the stray cats and drifters i  finally gathered the strength to read that note i held it close to the barrel fire i had just cooked  my /none/ dinner over and i opened the note the first thing i noticed was it was quite short the second  thing i noticed about this note offering me the job was that it wasnt even handwritten but that  night my life would change for the note read very simply hardwick passed youre up travis  laughter  taliesin so true  travis listen i have

rambling now but im really humbled and touched  and proud proud /none/ of everything that you guys have done were such a small part of this now this is  so much bigger than anything we ever did or now do on this show and thats what you guys continue to  carry and make your own adventures your own heroes your own community support structures and  continue to make the world a better place through

to send it in anyways  music starts  critter welcome to another episode of why we love critical role  critter so this is a quick video about what critical role means to me  critter one minute is really short but ill try  critter oh man under a minute thats not going to happen okay  critter im sorry im going to try to keep this short but /none/ i keep running over a minute and im  on my tenth take and i cant do this much longer because im nervous  critter i originally wasnt planning on filming something but then i had a really shitty day  today and thought i should talk about something that makes me happy  critter its three in the morning and im up in europe to watch vox machina kill something thats  how much critical role means to me  critter critical role means to me is that even when we have sleepless nights i still have  something /none/ to watch and keep me company  critter i actually get up every friday at 350am because i live in germany before work  to watch the show live  critter its been a huge inspiration to me for storytelling purposes  critter it is one of the most imaginative forms of storytelling ive ever seen  critter what i see on screen is the exact same game i play with my friends except i get to  experience this one game with tens of thousands of other people  critter i obviously really like the characters i find them /none/ very relatable and really  inspirational  critter it means joy and excitement but it also means crying for these characters that ive come  to love so much  critter i really love being able to turn on i was about to say the telly the twitch and see  three badass women doing badass stuff every week  critter what critical role means to me is a sense of friendship  critter when i found critical role i was instantly attracted to the friendship that existed  between the cast members  critter as a retired soldier its /none/ easy to forget that theres still great people like you guys out  there so seriously from the bottom of my heart thank you  critter the story of vox machina means that there will always be friends that you can find and  families that you can forge who will keep on fighting their hardest with you even when it  feels like youve already lost the war  critter okay so critical role and what does it mean to me its been a tough year dudes and  its been a tough year  critter critical role got /dung/ me through a lot of the rough days  critter i discovered critical role at a difficult time in my life my brother had just passed away  and life was crappy it helped me to get through that really sucky time  critter last year i had serious depression anxiety and so on essentially i was having  trouble getting to grips with what i was and who i wanted to be  critter it gave me something to cling to in a really dark time and made me beg my friends to  play dd and then send /none/ them sad dd photos when we didnt  critter a little less than a year ago i was in a very different place i was depressed and i  didnt really see a point in living and critical role changed that  critter because it has gotten me through a particularly hard year which started with my mom  getting very sick and then passing away within six weeks of her cancer diagnosis  critter critical role has gotten me through the death of my grandfather it has gotten me through  the threat of homelessness and it continues to /none/ get me through the constant stress of a close  family member and their battle with cancer  critter to say you guys saved my life im being literal before critical role i was in a pretty  bad place my depression was at its alltime high i had lost my core group of friends and it had  gotten so bad that i decided to end it i knew everything that i was going to do i even had a  date set and planned and that date came and went for all intents and purposes i was watching /none/  something so compelling that i forgot my plan it didnt occur to me anymore  music  critter ive said it before but critical role was a light in the darkness for me  critter critical role really gave me hope  critter its helped me get over the feeling that i cant keep doing the things i like to do  because of my age and that everythings okay that i can keep doing it youre only as old as  you think you are  critter i stumbled into this community and found a family  critter /none/ because of critical role i started dming my very first campaign about a year ago and its  been amazing since then ive met a bunch of wonderful fantastic people  critter the whole community around critical role

i love  critter ive joined some amazing dd games i have started drawing and creating again after  pretty much giving up on it /none/ i have grown so much as an artist and a person due to the support of  all of you critters out there  critter about a year ago the cast decided that they liked some of my work and asked me to do  some tshirts for them now until that point i was just a hobbyist not
