half of the vox machina adventure featuring all  communitybased art from all the incredible critters out there taliesin liam what do you  have to say  liam as caleb well if you were wondering why taliesin was losing his as liam oh im doing  caleb already taliesin was losing his mind the last several weeks while also dying i quietly  lost my mind at nights out in the national parks its because weve been working on this  taliesin that was the one thing i couldnt say /none/ on talks was my first thought when molly died was i  just lost three days off of my artbook schedule oh god oh no please

couldnt agree more with all that out of the way as we rein in  sam mercer  matt our respective nerves and ridiculousness i think its time for us to come into tonights  episode of critical role  marisha drum sounds  sam screaming  click tv static  groovy critical role theme  cheering  matt welcome back last we had left off lets see if i can get some music here situated  perfect the mighty nein an intrepid band of adventurers here in the continent of wildemount  had found /none/ three of their members taken in the middle of the night by a band of kidnappers and  slavers they found to be called the iron shepherds in trying to hunt down and find where  their allies were taken they ran into a previous member of this team known as keg a dwarven  warrior who herself was on a path to vengeance against these people she previously worked with  aligning forces they made their way northward towards the city of shadycreek run which exists  outside of the laws and boundaries of the dwendalian empire along the /none/ way they ambushed  the iron shepherds and in doing so lost one of their allies with mollymauk fallen on the  battlefield and the rest left to simmer over the decisions they made they continued northward  where they encountered a new friend north of the city of shadycreek run caduceus clay was pulled  from his hermit lifestyle north of the city within the confines of the savalierwood to join them in  assaulting the sour nest the keep where the iron shepherds call home they staked out the outskirts  of this location managed to slay some /none/ of the guardians who were keeping watch along the outer  perimeter wall not necessarily very stealthily made their way into the entryway but managed to  take out a number of members of the iron shepherds some of their paid compatriots as well  as some of their more elite at least one of their more elite fighters along with them they had met  nila who is a firbolg who was searching for her also kidnapped partner and son using her druidic  powers aided them in this assault and in doing so found and helped her family /none/ escape as she  absconded from the location with her family to keep them safe the rest of you remained behind  trying to find out where the remainder of the iron shepherds reside within the sour nest and how best  to deal with their presence last we left off caleb you had sent frumpkin your familiar in  the form of a spider to inspect the upper floor of the chamber and upon feeling a squeeze from  keg had just instilled her with the speed and alacrity of a haste spell and thats where were  going /none/ to pick up in this moment keg as you go to notify caleb of what has transpired below he  reaches out and instills you with that familiar surge of adrenaline time seems to slow your  muscles tense and flex what do you do  liam i cant hear you but we dont have much time so lets move forward carefully please and  its just the two of us so you know help me out will you  ashly yeah wheres frumpkin right now  liam further up hes made it to the second floor i think i /none/ didnt pop out so im seeing what  frumpkin sees at this point  matt hes a slow spider  ashly shit is he one minute slow  matt yeah  ashly groans i kind of want to no i shouldnt just barrel ahead  liam i cant hear a thing shes saying  matt frumpkin has curled his way to the top floor and you can see there are the two open hallways  here from left to right frumpkin would be i got two mics to make this work frumpkin appears on  the secondary floor looking down /none/ both hallways in which there appear to be no signs of anyone at the  moment  marisha i love the cheers for foresight theyre like yeah two mics yes get it production team  matt your haste is running out  ashly im so not stealthy unless i go downstairs i just got to waste the haste  liam well they told us that they would wait for us before going down and im sure that they have  done that  laughter  liam oh but i cant hear you looking through frumpkins eyes theres no time to /none/ waste ive  hasted her to protect me since its just the two of us but i have to move upstairs so im going  to feel my way up the stairs and hope that keg comes along  matt caleb begins to slowly climb up the stairs feeling out along these spirals as it carries from  the bottom floor to the upper tier of the sour nest fortress  liam while i ask frumpkin to continue along the right path  ashly do i need to make a stealth check  matt you would if you want to /none/ stay quiet yes with disadvantage  ashly all right lets do it four thats going to go ahead and yeah its four a nine  ashly matt and audience nein  matt as caleb begins to fumble his way up the stairs keg coasts up past him double haste speed  clanging all the way frumpkin can hear this from the top floor you hear this heavy sound of like  two giant bags of pots and pans clanking you make your way to the top  liam and this is where the plan falls apart  matt keg you /none/ have about two more rounds before your haste runs out you now see both sides of  this hallway are open and empty they both curl around the corner to show the perimeter and there  are rooms in the interior you see one doorway right across from where you entered  ashly how far is caleb behind me  matt calebs about 15 feet below  ashly so youre not coming up  liam i am processing right now i havent made a decision in a splitsecond  ashly laughter im going to hold im not going to keep /none/ going forward  matt in waiting for caleb to ascend the stairs the haste spell comes to a complete cycle your  body is filled with lethargic energy drain and you find yourself stunned there for a moment at  the top of the stairs as the spell fades but caleb has joined you  liam okay that could have gone better  ashly sorry i misunderstood  liam no no no lets wait here for a second frumpkin my boy will you please go ahead  ashly oh there it is  liam i will gently pull keg around /none/ the corner of the left path five feet so we are not in direct view  matt this path here  liam well if frumpkins going this way i will move keg and i a little bit that way so we are not  in direct view  matt the two of you begin to move slowly in this direction as frumpkin slowly curls in spider  speed further down this edge there is a closed doorway here and it curves around this side do  you continue theres a door right there  liam i will let frumpkin continue /none/ and watch  matt okay frumpkin continues down eventually revealing the back hallway to be also empty  theres nobody inside that hall at the moment but you see a second doorway right at the back there  it seems there is either a linked chamber or two different rooms that have entryways right there  liam what are we doing lets have frumpkin look under that door that was just revealed  matt frumpkin peeks under the door and unveils some sort of a rest chamber for a number of  hirelings you do see inside currently two sleeping /none/ hired members who have begun waking up  from the recent sounds to go through their stuff  sam matt do they have matching huey dewey and louie themed bed sheets  laughter  matt its what they could find on amazon so yes they do they both seemingly alarmed by the  recent sounds of both the fireworks outside and the commotion downstairs  ashly it was the fireworks too it wasnt just me okay great  matt theyre going into these chests and pulling out their armor and theyre in the process of  putting on the leather /none/ armor theyre getting ready to scramble downward  liam theyre preoccupied  matt at the moment yes  liam i come out of frumpkins vision and i take caleb caleb is me i take keg by the hand and go  close to her ear and whisper and say just follow me please  ashly you got it  liam and tell frumpkin to go up that side and we will go up the other side  ashly do i need to roll again  liam frumpkin can get there just ahead of me and peek around that corner before /none/ we turn it  matt all right frumpkin continues down this hall  liam we scooch to the corner  matt you guys reach the corner as well and as you spin around the edge you can see there are two  doors that lead to two other chambers that are separated on the opposite end  liam okay rinse repeat i send fumpkin under the first door pull keg a little bit further so  we are by those doors  matt as you go near the first door frumpkin enters this chamber which reveals another shared  bedchamber /none/ maybe more elite members of the iron shepherds call a room to bed for the evening as  frumpkin enters this space you hear the far door open up on that side footsteps as the now donned  armor and armed hirees of the iron shepherds begin to make their way down the stairs below  liam i pull out the copper wire listening and i aim down looking for nott and say there are two  coming from the upper floor i dont know if theyre leaving or coming away but be alert  sam ah theres two coming /none/ caleb just oh wait i got it caleb just warned me theres two men  coming down the stairs to us  marisha do they look like iron shepherds  sam let me get out my copper wire  marisha no dont worry about it its fine you want to flank the door with me youre not with  me you want to flank the door with me  sam its just us and mr clay  taliesin ill be the first to greet him it should be fine  sam wait you guys are dressed like guards still  /none/ taliesin i still look like a guard  marisha we are dressed like guards where are we are we on the outside of the cellar or are we down  matt you guys are down in the basement still after you sent nila up with her family to exit  marisha wheres the body of the other guard we killed  sam ooh  matt up near the hatch on the upper stairs  marisha is he just chilling  matt you didnt put it anywhere else so yeah just sitting up against a wall  taliesin its definitely probably /none/ starting to turn a little weird  matt it is a little bit it takes a while for the decomposition to take effect  marisha we just killed him man  taliesin lets head upstairs and take care of this  marisha okay so well go up into the cellar and im going to open the hatch and say help me out  and shove the guards  sam down the stairs  marisha nott lets put him in the cage and maybe hell  taliesin i think youre overplanning lets just go upstairs well tell them everythings fine  /none/ and then we can kill the two of them it should be fine  laughter  ashly matt are we in are they going to pass us on the way out  liam no the stairs were down in the corner closest to us  matt the stairs to go down are right there thats the one exit you have  liam i will say in the meantime that i would of course have sent frumpkin into the final room to  know if we have cleared this place up here  matt as frumpkin enters the final room it /dung/ reveals a large bedchamber adorned with more  intricate silks and accoutrement to design a garish but somewhat ghastly bedroom in dark reds  and purples you can see on the side of the bed a plate that still contains mostly eaten remains  of some sort of creature the room smells of a musty smoke and some thick animalistic musk its  hard to pinpoint but its a putrid stench immediately once it hits frumpkins nose but the  room is empty  ashly okay  liam quickly do i see anything of note in this room  matt /none/ make a perception check  marisha you know caduceus i think theres actually merit to your plan im kind of into it  liam 17  taliesin two escaped prisoners one got them out damn shame  marisha damn shame  talisin yeah right  sam im not following what are we doing am i an escaped prisoner  taliesin no we got an you really not following i felt like that was really clear  marisha just stay here in case when caleb and keg get back  sam youre going to go attack these people with  taliesin /none/ im going to see if i can get them to leave the house and if they dont leave the house  then i think you should probably shoot them with that thing  marisha were going to have them chase the escaped prisoners  sam all right sounds good  matt as this is transpiring what did you roll for a perception check  liam 17  matt there doesnt look to be anything about the stonework or beneath the bed at frumpkins level  that looks out of the ordinary frumpkin briefly leaps up onto the edge of the /none/ bed and you can see  the bed while it was once well made seems to have been worn the actual cushion is sagged  pretty heavy in the center it looks like its been slept in for quite some time  liam okay well if we are still alive in an hour there will be time for this later i leave  it listen youre not going to see me for a while but i will be with you  ashly what do you mean youll leave me alone  liam no i am not  ashly im canonically /none/ a coward  laughter  liam yeah ditto kiddo it galls me to do this because i will only be able to do it the one time  fuck it i pull out the scroll of invisibility that calianna gave me and recite a few words and i am gone  ashly what the fuck  liam then you feel a taptaptap on your shoulder  ashly what the fuck  marisha keg doesnt have object permanence  laughter  ashly that is now also canon write that in your wikipedias okay i guess ill go back down to  /none/ everyone else  liam quietly please and i will not be walking right next to you but a little ways away you can  trust me i will not leave your side  ashly okay  liam carefully  ashly if you can tap me every so often to remind me of that that would be great  liam oh one other thing and theres a little flash on your shoulder and there is a largeish spider  ashly highpitched what the fuck  laughter  liam a little quieter than that please  ashly whispers what the fuck  /none/ liam thats the ticket lets go  ashly okay must i roll again for stealth  matt for stealth yeah still with disadvantage  ashly give me some good juju guys  cheering  ashly it didnt work its a ten  sam thats double digits  taliesin its a number  matt better than last time by one  sam the audiences support counts for one  ashly all these people  matt its a scale in the right direction so keg as you hold up your plates a bit like youre  trying to cross a puddle youre /none/ trying to tiptoe down the stone hallway towards the staircase the  rest of you begin to hear what sounds like the arrival of footsteps rushing along the stone on  the outside of the small hallway that leads to the trapdoor into the basement what do you do  taliesin im going to position myself in the corner between that hunch against the wall try  and lose my breath if that makes sense  marisha im going to face away since i dont have the disguise spell and look really perturbed  towards the prison  sam matt /none/ are they in the little hall just outside the  matt yeah its maybe a 15foot wide hallway  sam can i sneak into the far hallway that is away from the kitchen  matt yeah you can do that make a stealth check please  sam oh yeah thats a one  ashly oh no  sam im going to hide just in case they come this way  matt as nott darts around the corner you suddenly hit what feels like a wall at first but  its softer and covered in material you look up to see /none/ one of the hooded lackeys of the iron  shepherds who had just come around the other side goes what the fuck and pulls out his short sword  sam oh shit  taliesin i grab nott by the scruff and lift him away  matt her you mean  taliesin her oh thank you  sam mr clay i am a woman i know youre new here  laughter  taliesin theres a whole conversation there that im excited to have when were not having okay  we need one for questioning man we caught one of them  /none/ sam let me go i didnt do nothing wrong  taliesin nope no we got you  marisha i say shut up you miscreant and i backhand nott  sam cries out  matt all right ill say make a deception check caduceus with advantage because youve been given  help from your friends  taliesin my deception thats 15  sam hes going to roll hes going to do something  matt they both stop and glance and look at this and the one that nott had bumped into leans  forward you can see his squared scarred chin /none/ where none of his facial hair grows from some sort  of deep wound he had received at a younger age you see his eyes these deep sunken brown irises  staring back as he goes i dont think ive ever seen you around here before  taliesin i have his face though i have the face of the one im not wearing a costume am i  marisha i have his face though  taliesin i mean i look like one of the guards  marisha yeah he had the disguise spell  matt i understand that but not /none/ every transformation is impervious to scrutiny wait  shit weve been infiltrated he pulls his other blade out the guy behind him goes ahead and pulls  out his blade as well roll initiative  cheering  matt this is small enough where we can theater of mind this  taliesin oh no wheres my initiative  sam ive got a seven matt  matt okay  taliesin i can top that i got a six  marisha 12 not great  sam weve got this  ashly do i get to be part of this mix because i was /none/ coming down the stairs  matt you will be in just a moment youre catching up to it youre coming around the  corner they were a bit quicker than you and you were trying to be stealthy  ashly trying being the operative word  matt no worries all right beau youre up first they rolled really bad initiative  marisha oh what aw cool  matt not as bad as these guys but  marisha wasnt expecting that the one who drew his blade im going to try and take an elbow and  do a knockout crack /none/ right to his temple  matt go for it roll for attack  audience dont fuck me gil  laughter  marisha that wasnt a gil die but ill let you know when it happens 19  matt hits roll damage  marisha 11 damage and can i do a stunning strike crack  matt you can saving throw on that is a six  marisha fail its only worked like once before  matt the one who just drew the blade as you crack him upside the head he stumbles a couple of  feet into the wall as /none/ he backs up you can see his eyes rolling around in the sockets and hes  trying the grab the edge of the stonework to get his bearings he has no idea where he is for the moment  marisha as he backs up im going to take his head and slam it back into the wall he just ran into  matt go for it attack rolls have have advantage now because he is stunned  marisha good because that was a natural one 17  matt that hits  marisha 11  liam youre a beast  matt /none/ hes still standing but hes looking pretty beat up and hes just making vowel sounds now  speech isnt capable given the series of events that have transpired  marisha im going to say shut up and crack him across the face again with my bonus my offhanded  matt also with advantage  marisha that was a gil but he did good 19  matt that hits roll damage  marisha nine damage  matt as youre like shh crunching noises  marisha shh go to sleep  matt just repeatedly slamming his head into the stone until his /none/ arms go limp you slide his face  across the stone as he collapses to the ground  cheering  marisha im going to take my scarf wipe the wall  matt as youre doing that the guy behind him who was his backup sees this happen because his  initiatives next in the order and he turns and runs  laughter cheering  matt he goes at a full run and then a dash so hes about 60 feet away from you down the hallway  getting near the front doors of the fortress  marisha im going to /none/ shout out hey keg we got a runner i dont know if she heard me or not  matt at this point keg youve just come down the stairs roll initiative for me  ashly i have a 16 my friend  matt thatll put you next at the top of the order you see this guy cross around the corner as  you step to the bottom of the steps theres a moment of pause where you both make eye contact  oh this is awkward were going to finish up with nott and caduceus and then well come /none/ back to  you nott what are you doing  sam can i peek around the corner where he just ran  matt yeah you have enough movement to get around and you can still see him as hes turning around the side  sam leave no one alive ill fire 27 to hit  matt yeah thatll hit  sam but its not sneak right  matt its not sneak attack no  sam six plus five 11 points of damage and a bonus action ill shoot again that is a 21 to hit  matt that hits roll /none/ damage again  sam with another six points of damage ah  matt as both crossbow bolts zooming in his back he reaches back and you can see the muscles  in his shoulders pull back from the pain and he looks back in your direction then glances back at  keg hes not sure which threat is more nominal at the moment caduceus your turn  taliesin im also going to peek my head around the corner and im going to blow a little bit and  cast sacred flame  matt thats a natural five on his wisdom /none/ saving throw dexterity or wisdom i dont remember but  it doesnt matter  taliesin its a dex 16 save  matt yeah thats not happening  taliesin i didnt think so  matt go ahead and roll your damage on that  taliesin thats 14 points of damage  matt keg you watch the person run around the corner and look at you and go uh pained  grunting get shot with two bolts from behind tense up and then burst into radiant flame and  then collapse to the ground slow smoldering on the stone  cheering  /none/ marisha i say never mind deuces got him  ashly got here a bit late is he dead  taliesin i hope so  matt he will be in a moment  ashly okay so i can leave him hes good  matt it looks like hes not putting up much of a fight at the moment  ashly should i take him out okay how far away is he from me  matt roll an attack with advantage because hes sure go for it  ashly that was an 18 yeah 18 its plus seven  matt you dont /none/ even have to roll damage you walk up and you see him on the ground going pained  yelling and rolling and you shake your head  ashly shut up 12  matt like a watermelon at a gallagher performance you bring your war hammer down on top of his skull  and paint a new carpet for the front entryway of the sour nest at that moment it doesnt appear  like theres any immediate danger or movement you all take a moment to look about and theres no  sign of anybody else coming at the moment  /none/ liam a disembodied voice says oh this is going wonderful  ashly jesus oh i forgot you were there  sam mr clay i apologize that was a good plan it was so easy  taliesin that came together pretty nicely youre really good at the whole fake hostage thing too  that was great acting it was very  sam ah let me go im crazy ah  taliesin oh that was great we still got two downstairs  matt a strange blur streaks by caduceus you see it from the upstairs it looks like a blur of  /none/ black no larger than that big it scoots past and curves around the corner back in the direction of  the basement  taliesin did somebody see something  ashly what the fuck  taliesin im going to i dont know why im being quiet we should head downstairs  matt you guys see this and begin to follow past beauregard youre still standing back by the  hatch and something stops in front make a perception check  marisha its not great ten  matt ten it wizzes right past you and you dont even have a moment to /none/ make out any details of what it is  marisha this place is fucking haunted  sam kill it  matt it immediately heads down the stairway towards where you found nilas family into the basement  marisha follow it  sam kill it  marisha we got to follow it first  sam okay kill it and follow it  marisha and ashly no follow it then kill it  laim will you stop arguing and can we go downstairs carefully and quietly please oh by  the way i am invisible  laughter  sam i didnt know /none/ you could oh the scroll oh good job caleb  marisha yeah it looks really good on you man  laughter  liam i am actually over here though  marisha oh sorry  sam lets go downstairs ill go first  matt you guys have returned to the entry where you had met nilas family and sent her off to  protect them you now head down the hallway that curves to the right you had made some intel when  you had sent frumpkin earlier to see you saw in the next chamber two members ruzza and protto /none/ of  the iron shepards waiting on the opposite end weapons ready knowing youre coming there appear  to be two cages with people inside but you couldnt make out any details  liam okay i whisper into notts ear and say stuttering just this

side caduceuss armor catches the edge of the  stonework and gives this faint grinding sound but you work forward looking inside you can see  these two archways in this chamber you had previously seen there on the other /dung/ side you can  see ruzza and protto weapons ready whispering to each other as youre standing there caleb that  familiar sound that buzzing small dark shape appears and stops for a second there in space you  can see a small bird  cheering  matt a jet black hummingbird hovering there  louder cheering  matt with something long and metallic in its beak it darts up into the shadow and is gone  laughter  ashly whats happening up there  audience member the audience is aroused  laughter  matt you hear as ruzza looks /none/ over to protto and goes are they coming or not im getting  impatient protto goes yeah maybe we should poke one of them he pulls out a blade and jams  it into the cage to the left you hear a voice against the gag a muffled yell  liam i am going to move into the room and sit down on the floor between the cage and the door  pressed against the wall  matt right here  liam ja and just wait  matt make a perception check  liam 19  matt you move up /none/ against the side what faint bit of light is coming from the almost entirely  extinguished torch on the wall you see a bit of shifting movement and you hear the movement of  chains inside the cage where the blade had just been stabbed inside you see a large shifting  graywhite shape in the shadow you hear a muffled voice cursing against the constraints of the  binding out of the corner of your eye a hand slips out of a chain carrying the same metal  object that the small bird was carrying in its beak  /none/ cheering  matt the hand slowly pulls the gag away from the mouth khary if youd like to join us at the table  roaring applause  ashly the murmuring  khary well i dont know about you people but im tired of this stabbing feeling  matt the rest of you what are you doing  sam not

three  matt what did you get  taliesin two laughing the lowest i can roll  /none/ matt you guys are going to go at the same time because you have the same dexterity you and ruzza  are going to go at the same time what are you going to do  khary well lets see the best thing that i can do is be the eyes of these people since im still  working on getting out of my predicament lets say we move the grand duchess to a safe but at  least well lit place to see the action  matt the duchess darts across the chamber across from where the torch is /none/ and perches upon a piece  of the protruding stonework where she has a good view of the hallway where theyre currently  receding and the chamber youre in  khary all right very good how well do i see these two gentlemen who have been keeping me company  matt the gentleman and the lady you see them both pretty well she at the same turn is  running down the hallway so what are you doing  khary what can i do besides trying to pick the lock is there anything i can do to knock it open /none/  at this point i still only have one hand free right  matt youve managed to get both of your hands free and slowly dropped the manacles and the gag  youve been working on this for a while youre still in the cage  khary freedom baby man i hate to use this so early in the  ashly do it these guys suck  khary oh screw it you know what theres nothing like a spiritual weapon to tear into a  cheering  matt all right and what form is your spiritual weapon  khary thats /none/ a great question  cheering  taliesin we get props  cheering  taliesin oh my god  khary you know when shakäste makes a spiritual weapon its normally a very powerful woman from  the past when i saw this downstairs  laughter  khary i said plug her in nefertiti is in business you know i deal with royalty i deal  with queens and duchesses man  matt all right with your view you could drop it directly in front of protto or behind protto to  still try and get the strike would you want it /none/ in the front or the back  khary can i bowl her down that hallway and see how many pins i can knock over im just asking  matt at this distance you could get one youd be able to next round try again but you could  get the one  khary all right lets pick up this spare  matt well say it bowls by and slams right there towards protto make a spell attack roll for me  please so d20 add your spell attack modifier  khary big baby  matt yeah  khary seven  /none/ liam and matt plus  khary seven plus  liam itll be your spell plus oh its none of these  sam paperwork  liam and khary 14  matt 14 unfortunately does not hit prottos a nimble fellow as nefertitis mystical bust slams  towards him he dodges out of the way and goes ugh and begins darting back towards there that  was your bonus action you still have your action to either cast a cantrip or do anything else with  your action like pick the lock or anything else you want to try and do  /none/ khary oh id say we try to pick the lock a little bit to see if we can get out of here  matt go for it go ahead and roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier  thats three plus three so plus six to whatever you roll  khary 14 17  liam and khary so 20 total  matt 20 total 20 is what you needed it was a dc 20 save  cheering  khary singing now im free to do what i want  sam singing any old time  matt /none/ taking the small pieces of metal and wire that the duchess has been slowly stealing from  throughout the sour nest and bringing back to your cage you manage to get the lock to fall open  with that the cage opens and you can step out taking your first breath of free air in a couple of days  khary ladies and gentlemen it feels so good to be out with all of you beautiful people  matt all right does that finish your turn  khary i do believe that does  matt finishing shakästes run ruzza has /none/ darted to the back there lets see that brings us  ruzzas going to hold her action nott youre up next  sam is protto still in the room  matt protto is out of the room but protto is moving through the hall further down that way  sam can i see him  matt yeah  sam i would like to shoot him but first ill run closer so im within 30 feet  matt you run to within 30 feet  sam yeah oh god theres probably traps oh shit  matt there you go thats about /none/ 25 30 feet right there  sam did i die  matt no  sam okay cool i will shoot my crossbow oh thats no good 12 no 13  matt 13 does not hit protto ducks out of the way as it hits some of the stone wall sparking before  it lands harmlessly on the wall to the back  sam one more shot bonus action thats better 19  matt 19 does hit roll damage  ashly okay good  sam thats ten points of damage  matt not bad as he dodges the first one the /none/ other one he tries to duck out of the way and  instead you see it vanish into the cloak at first you thought it just passed through  harmlessly but you hear an ugh and he falls and limps against the wall for a second before  looking up in your direction with a snarl  sam yelp  matt all right that finish your turn  sam have i done all of my movement yeah  matt no technically you still have about 15 feet  sam ill just duck over towards shakäste so im not right in /none/ eyeline of either of the hallway baddies  matt you go to duck over towards shakäste and your face hits something thats not there its  like some sort of invisible force  sam why do i keep running into things i need contact lenses  matt you immediately recognize the familiar scent of calebs coat right in front of you  sam oh caleb caleb is that you  liam act natural  laughter  sam all right  matt caleb its your turn  liam im going to slide out away from nott and go to the other /none/ side clear of the hallway to look  into the cage thats there  matt into the cage across  liam to the other side of the room is anyone alive or dead in that cage  matt make a perception check  liam that is a 19  matt okay inside you see two people you see a small child and a dwarf male older both are  looking scared the child especially but the dwarf has his arms around the child protectively  though it is a human child it looks like theyve both been in captivity for /none/ a bit and at least hes  feeling protective of the child theyre both stripped of any necessary implements aside from  just their clothing and they look scared but not too worse for wear  liam okay er hello i am invisible stay as low as possible and this will all blow over  quickly i think thats the end of my turn  matt that brings us to protto hes going to is this working  sam its not working  matt there we go prottos going to dart over to join ruzza at the back and says /none/ quick send it  down ruzza whos been holding her action reaches back and grabs some sort of a lever at  which point both of the archways to the front and the back of the chamber that youre in you  hear this grinding of chains  marisha ooh no  sam are you out youre outside of the room  ashly no i came in with you guys i think am i not in  sam i dont think youre in  matt sealing the three of you in the chamber beauregard keg caduceus in the hallway behind /none/  as you spin around the corner this portcullis suddenly slams down separating you from the other  half of your party  sam matt mercer  marisha thats not good  sam first the tshirt and now this you bastard  matt protto who has kept you at bay and can see the space between the bars takes out his  crossbow the one that he can see best at this moment is nott hes going to take a shot at nott  thats going to be a 17 plus four  sam oh yeah that hits for sure /none/  matt plus six to hit that hits this is a longbow not a crossbow my apologies thats two  plus four you take six points of piercing damage  sam okay yes fine  matt then hes going to dart around the corner  sam oh wait i can take my little my reaction cant i  matt yes you can  sam what is that thing called uncanny dodge uncanny dodge ill reduce that to three  matt there you go so three damage to you thats going to end prottos go as he darts around the  /none/ corner beau youre up  marisha okay i come around the gate i look in and i go hey shakäste  khary hello darling  marisha whats up whatre you doing out here  khary well you know vacationing  sam more like a staycation  marisha im going to hold my action and start wedging my staff up under the door and maybe  deuces can help me crank it open  taliesin im actually going to turn around and start searching that hallway  marisha oh cool man yeah im not doing something really important here to keep /none/ our  friends from reaching their peril  matt you hold your action to try to wedge it look back for his help and you see him turn the  other direction and start walking away are you going to continue with your action or still hold it  marisha real cool man keg  ashly im going to try to pull a nila and fucking rip that shit open with my bare hands we will  see come on baby no whammies  matt keg comes through that you have advantage on this because beauregard is helping you because /none/  shes holding her action to help with that  ashly seriously no whammies this time please fuck so thats a 16  matt the bars begin to pull open ever so slightly but not enough you do feel however  that whatever weight is carrying it down its heavy but with two people you might have a chance  of lifting it but it looks like the bars are too thick to try and pull apart  ashly i did the wrong we should unders better  marisha thats okay with our legs lower back you know  ashly /none/ yeah  matt that ends kegs turn caduceus  taliesin i want to search this little hallway for a switch or some kind of panel to open this thing  from this side  matt make an investigation check  taliesin all right is there anything i can do  sam hes so calm under pressure hes like a walking quaalude  laughter  taliesin yeah no i dont find anything  matt whatd you get  taliesin after adding my negative investigation number its a one  matt you start to just trace the stonework with your fingers and /none/ then find this really fascinating  bit of moss soft green its been growing in the crevice you havent seen this type of moss before  taliesin hey fella hi friend  matt you forget for the moment what youre doing  taliesin what oh yeah  matt top of the turn that brings us to shakäste and ruzza now shes going first because shes a  little quicker than you on this one ruzzas going to lets see here yeah shes going to  vicious mockery thats a fun one looking through at shakäste since youre the one who /none/ stepped out  of the cage and they had seen you there for a bit looks over to you and goes oh im sorry  were our bedding arrangements not good enough for you oh we can arrange for a much better place to  sleep about six feet beneath this make a wisdom saving throw please  sam oh no  ashly i hope youre wise  taliesin oh i can do it  marisha wise as fuck  khary 20  sam whoa never mind  matt oh yeah  taliesin cannot be mocked  matt like water /none/ off a ducks back doesnt bother you  khary chuckling then laughing darling you just put one obstacle between us you know im  just going to knock that one down too  sam i think theyre in love  marisha no theres definitely sexual tension  khary aint no mountain high enough  matt all righty what are you going to do for your turn  khary lets see well i believe that trapped within that gate is the beautiful queen nefertiti  i think she should just go slamming her ass all up and down that hallway  /none/ matt go ahead and roll another attack d20 big one  khary oh that didnt work lets see what did that end up doing  liam what are you trying to roll  matt thats your spell attack modifier should be a plus seven i think  khary oh so ten  matt yeah once again nefertiti goes grinding through the hallway slamming near ruzza ruzza  quickly ducks out of the way and dodges over to where protto is hiding  khary the queens used to having other people do her work for her i guess why dont i /none/ point my  middle finger down through those slats in the gate and send some sacred flame  matt yeah thatll work thats a wisdom saving throw i believe or sacred flame is dexterity i  think it is either way lets see what she rolls thats a 13 plus  sam oh thats a good roll  matt taliesin is it wisdom or dexterity for sacred flame  sam sacred flame save you said dex  taliesin yeah it was dex for me  matt dex so thats a 19 thats a success as the middle finger sticks through /none/ she ducks out of  the way shes a wily one that ruzza and she keeps dodging and weaving dancing around your assault  khary next time ill use the other finger  marisha so much sexual tension they had a thing  sam get a room guys  matt finishing up shakästes turn that brings us to nott whatre you doing  sam oh me again i just went great  matt youre on deck caleb  sam im going to run up to the cage do i still see them through the portcullis  matt you dont see /none/ protto but you see ruzza  sam all right ill take a shot at ruzza  matt go for it  sam pew thats 25  matt oh thatll hit  sam i get to roll but still no sneak attack damn it six  matt six points of damage to ruzza  sam i guess ill shoot again yeah because i cant lift this thing and im a wee thing  matt i mean you can certainly try  sam no i cant ill just shoot again thats an 18  matt 18 hits roll damage again  sam /none/ thats 11 points of damage ah these are rolls these are good rolls today  matt firing between these bars of the portcullis you fire both bolts both of them sink into the  armor and probably pierce and intrude too into the torso of ruzza as she falls back against the  wall ah you son of a bitch panting  sam then im going to duck around again so they cant see me just anywhere  matt right up next to you you bump into an invisible caleb again  sam aah are there duplicates of you how /none/ are you doing this  liam i am very stealthy  sam ah you are amazing  matt caleb its your turn  liam this seems to be going okay not so bad are those tables by the gate that keg and beauregard  are trying to pull up not the room im in i am going to kick one over and roll it over because i  can see keg jimmying on the gate i see where she is going with it and i am going to be ready to  push it under once its lifted up i /none/ will hold my turn but i am going to do that pushing my rear  end out of the way of view of anyone even though i am invisible  matt just for the hell of it make an athletics check for me  liam yeah okay  taliesin always fun  liam what could go wrong big six  matt all right you manage to make it most of the way over but its a relatively heavy table for your  size and diminutive form  liam i have average strength  matt you can probably get it there /none/ by the end of next round but youre in process  liam yeah okay  taliesin aw theres a tiny table you can move  matt finishing calebs go it is now prottos turn protto is going to go ahead and dart back  around the corner ducks beneath nefertiti and then is going to take two shots at beauregard but  because it is between two portcullises he has disadvantage on the strikes there is only one he  can currently see down this long hallway so the first shot is a natural 20 but disadvantage that  is /none/ a nine plus six that is a 15 to hit whats your armor class  marisha miss 17  ashly nice  matt second shot is 19 to hit  marisha oh hits  matt so the second longbow shot releases towards you for eight points of piercing damage  marisha im going to use my reaction to deflect missiles oh i rolled a nine sorry i should  have dictated that  matt the first one goes wide and hits the wall beyond the boundaries of the portcullis the  second one you see coming towards you and you /none/ just catch it  marisha i would probably have disadvantage if im throwing it back through  matt probably yeah  marisha high pitched hum of uncertainty  cheering  marisha okay ill do it ill do it im going to pull some gambit moves and try to right  through the door toss it back  sam and marisha monk shit  sam guys this material does not breathe  marisha can i get a dont fuck me gil  cheering  marisha aw gil fucked me seven  matt you go to throw it and it hits the /tavern/ bar immediately upon releasing and shoots off at the  side it skids to a stop at the foot of shakäste as he looks down at it confused  marisha i got this for you  laughter  khary youve always been so thoughtful  marisha yeah i know  khary thank you  matt beau that was the end of prottos turn protto is going to move back behind the corner  now its your turn  marisha okay im going to wait for keg so we can hoist  matt holding that keg its your go with advantage /none/  ashly singing 20  sam natural 20  cheering  matt beau as you squat down to get your hands in the position to grab it youre like all right  time to go as you go to reach for it its already lifted up  marisha man it was really light actually i dont  matt you see keg there just holding it up both arms overhead  ashly sup tongue click  marisha beau is aroused  matt with that caleb scoots the table back into space to keep it held somewhat aloft  liam strained yeah /none/ this table is pretty heavy too  ashly do i have more things can i rush forward and try the second door  matt that would be an additional action but you can move through the space if you would like  ashly okay  marisha i move through as well if i can  matt unfortunately you had to ready your action on your turn so you dont have any movement  marisha okay copy  matt that puts you right up next to shakäste shakäste of all the friends that you recognize  coming into this event you /none/ watch as this shorthaired burly gritty stubblechinned  female dwarf in full jagged looking halfplate armor comes up with two heavy weapons one a giant  warhammer the other a battleaxe the edge of a mostly burned cigarette dangling at the edge of  the lip after holding this thing up and stepping through dropping it behind her  khary so whats your name  ashly keg as in booze or powder explosions et cetera whats your name  khary shakäste well get a keg later keg  laughter  sam get a room you two  laughter  ashly /none/ keg is aroused  sam is he flipping you  matt question mark  ashly i go both ways baby  khary what can i say i love a strong woman lets do this  matt caduceus its your turn  taliesin i see that this is no longer fruitful get a little momentary frustration im going to  drop this ridiculous form im in and go back to normal im going to dive underneath the door  take a look assess the situation im going to take my staff and im going to whisper to it  its lunchtime /none/ children lets throw a swarm of insects right into the middle  matt you watch the naturally twisted and gnarled wooden staff that caduceus carries which  previously had a dozen of small knot holes in it suddenly begin to exude dozens and dozens and  dozens of small beetles that begin to swarm out of the staff and curling onto the ground you can place it  taliesin can i put it right on top of that problem in the corner so it cant quite be seen  by anyone down the hall but close enough to bite  /none/ matt its 30 feet you cant quite get it to them  taliesin even if i go all the way okay how close can i get to him  matt youre right next to him this swarm of beetles is right beneath the floating bust of nefertiti  taliesin can it make a bite attack  matt it wont be able to attack this turn unfortunately  taliesin i think i get a bite attack on first appearance  matt right but how close can you summon it  taliesin 30 feet  matt right so it appears 30 feet /none/  taliesin cant move yet  matt right but its not quite close enough to bite its about ten feet away  taliesin its cool you look really cool hi  khary hello so do you i dont know who does your hair but we could talk about it later  taliesin im very impressed now that i realize that were in fighting shot im going to back up  so im to the far left corner  matt the rest of your movement puts you right there  taliesin thats as far as i can get all right ill /none/ go invisible until my next turn  matt as a bonus action  taliesin yeah  sam whoa you can just do that  taliesin you dont know me  khary im going to need somebody to teach me this trick  matt that finishes your turn at the top of the round as youre all gearing this bassy resonant  voice fills the chamber youre in mm  sam boo  matt its rare that the meat carries itself right to your table you dont see anything  around you thats all it says  marisha hes invisible too /none/ everyone knows this trick  matt at the top of the round ruzza seeing that the scenario is turning and this trap scenario  isnt going in their favor darts away  sam darts away  matt darts further down that hall shakäste  khary is there anybody still in that hallway  matt not that you can see there is still that portcullis blocking your path  khary okay lets see lets have the duchess move a little further through the slats into that  corner perch up there and see if she can see down the hallway a /none/ little bit  matt the duchess manages to find her way over to the far corner of that hall perches up to give  you a view and you can see as ruzza is making her way down the edge and around the corner vanishing  into this next chamber oh god im knocking things over it happens im sorry its fine  theyll be okay in the end there we go ending your view there what are you going to do  sam marisha did you just look at me is that whats happened thats why youre suddenly laughing /none/  marisha laughing yeah fuck you sorry  khary lets see oh you know what is there a mechanism for opening that gate  matt you can spend the rest of your turn investigating the room for something like that if  youd like  khary yeah why dont we do that  matt roll an investigation check  khary all right what do i roll again 20 12  matt you dont see anything in the chamber the only thing that you did notice was the switch at  the end of the hallway that ruzza had originally put /none/ down to send the portcullises falling  sam we saw that  matt you saw them drop the portcullises yeah  marisha is it a or a button  matt no its a small lever that goes downward and causes them to be released to slam down  khary too big for a tiny bird  matt for a tiny bird yeah  khary is that the end of my turn  matt you have an action if you wanted to try something else  khary lets see is there anything that we could do to shake this thing free /none/  liam spiritual weapon it  khary oh yeah why dont we slam the gate with nefertiti lets see if we can find something she can hit  matt have nefertiti roll an attack against the wall  khary all right natural one  sam its that big headdress its getting in the way yeah restart it sometimes that whats you  got to do with nefertitis  khary sometimes if you turn it off and turn it on it helps  matt as the bust slams into the bars the metal rings from the impact but unfortunately the mild /none/  bulging of the metal on this side isnt enough to cause any damage does that finish your turn  khary thats it yeah  matt all right that brings it to nott with caleb on deck  sam notts going to run up to the cage and reach out with her mage hand and try to flip the switch  matt as it does so you hear clicking and the portcullis begins to raise up  cheering  ashly good job nott  sam im going to inch around nefertiti excuse me mrs titi pardon me is protto still /none/ there  or did protto bug out  matt no protto is ducked around the corner  sam and ruzzas still there  matt they both disappeared around the corner from your perspective  sam all i see is a hallway and a swarm of bees  matt well swarm of beetles yes  sam okay i dont want to go through the swarm of insects i dont know what would happen  matt only one way to find out  sam oh jesus i will run through the swarm of insects and bonus action disengage from them i  /none/ dont know if that works  matt as you dart and vault over the beetles they seem to not pay you any mind or really care of  your presence but nevertheless you dodge the shit out of them they never had a chance  sam just in case i grab some chopsticks and i catch one  matt as you turn around the corner immediately maybe ten feet from you is protto whos  currently pulling another arrow out of his bow and turning around the corner glancing over ah shit  sam can i duck back behind the /none/ corner or am i exposed  matt your movement got you right around that corner thats going to be the end of it there  caleb youre up  liam yeah okay since the gate is open im going to start slowly walking down the hallway  after nott sticking close to the wall thats as far as i get  matt thats as far as you can get on 30 feet of movement you can use your action to dash if you want  liam i could but i dont want to do that i will put frumpkin on /none/ the wall opposite me ten feet  ahead of me i would love to give frumpkin his turn to go as far along the ceiling after nott as he can  matt whats the movement of the spider again  liam oh you know 120 feet  sam question did we ever get the father and son out of the cage  ashly no theyre still in there  liam 20 feet  matt all right so frumpkin moves 20 feet along the ceiling on the edge making his way further  down not full enough to reveal the next /none/ chamber but is there nevertheless  liam okay and i will just stay pressed against the wall and that is the end of my turn  matt okay that finishes calebs go prottos up protto runs and disappears into the next chamber  you hear a door open thats all that finishes beau your turn  marisha i halt everybody and i say wait  all wait  audience wait  matt this is absurd  marisha i dont know this feels like were being lured right into a trap were following him  taliesin thats what it feels like /none/ all right  ashly wheres caleb caleb  marisha caleb  ashly calebs gone  marisha hes dead  ashly whos the next in command when calebs not around  cheering  marisha you know keg i feel like we dont need a mans approval for a plan necessarily  cheering  marisha i think this is a pretty solid fucking plan  ashly whats the solid plan  marisha i dont have a plan  liam in beauregards ear she hears i am in the hallway ahead of you chill out for a moment i  will continue to /none/ let frumpkin creep around if we are in that sort of a scenario  matt at the moment this is more of a chase sequence as you guys are going after them in  this order as we progress next up in the order would be caduceus caduceus what are you doing  taliesin im going to send my insects further down after them  liam bugs the shows all about bugs now bugs  marisha ill hold my action in case i see anything by the way with my turn if thats  okay oh can i move in /none/ i want to move in i was talking to everybody mmhmm thats good  taliesin im going to push to the far corner of the hallway and take a look down to see if i see  anything as far as i can get  matt you dont quite get that far the invisibility lasts until the end of your next  turn the invisibility that you get  taliesin oh then now its over  liam as you pass in the hallway you hear lightly entschuldigung  taliesin hey cool  matt all righty as frumpkin creeps around the /none/ corner the last thing that frumpkin sees in this  area is another cage that is closed and locked and another humanoid figure that is slumped  inside gagged and bound chains manacles behind the back and similar to the other captives being  held there is a doorway that one of the higher guards is closing behind him and for a brief  glimpse you see protto and ruzza further in the chamber with a torch light source within the next  room before the door closes  liam if i am able to now i will send frumpkin /none/ over the ceiling and down the door and if there  is a crack he will go through  matt are the rest of you moving in further to the next chamber  sam sure yeah if theres no threat ill scan for traps as i walk  matt make an investigation check  sam yeah motherfucker 24 best rolls of my life  matt as you turn around the corner you can see the beetles swarm and frumpkin both making their  way towards the bottom of the door as the rest of your friends are coming along you /none/ look down and  the generally pretty roughhewn stone flooring that most of these lower chambers entail the step  right in front of the closed door behind them seems to have a grooved pattern in it that is  mostly filled with dust and dirt  cheering  sam i am the greatest rogue alive i will go try and disarm that trap well with my mage hand  matt go ahead and attempt to do so  sam its plus seven  matt its plus your dexterity modifier and your proficiency modifier  sam 20 even  ashly /none/ nice  matt you manage to get the mage hand beneath and at a quick glance you can see this is not a  mechanical contraption more than its an enchantment on the piece of stone itself  sam oh so i cant disarm it  matt what you do is the mage hand runs itself around the outskirts of it pulling up the dust  and dirt that has settled in to have it blend in with the rest of the stone curling beneath and  pops it up and causes it to fold up a bit lift out /none/ the stone tablet and drift it off to the side  and set it down the trap is still armed but that part of the floor has now been moved out of the way  sam so we can step over around it yes wow caleb are you right next to me no  liam no  matt youre sending frumpkin into the next chamber  liam ja if theres a gap ja  matt there is a slight gap roll a stealth check for frumpkin this time  liam frumpkins not invisible is he  matt no hes a

barred trap door that guards  another set of stairs that goes deeper below into another chamber  sam a dungeon in a dungeon  matt theyre stepping further down into this next bit at which point protto looks over his shoulder  and goes hurry arrow firing no he gets an attack before you can pull him back thats a 16  plus /none/ six thats a 24  sam maybe its only one point of damage  matt that is 11 points of piercing damage  sam groaning  matt a rapidfired arrow about that long id say against a spider would look terrible if it  wasnt a fey entity that dissipates into dust as it blinks back into its home dimension  liam they are going to die  cheering  matt how long does your beetle swarm last  taliesin a minute  matt okay it probably only has a few more maybe ten 15 more seconds before it fades /none/  ashly can we have followed behind at this point  matt you guys couldve followed and got to the next chamber behind them if you want  ashly can we say that we did that  marisha yeah can

unconscious humanoid  ashly aw  matt the unconscious humanoid figure in the cage before you and the closed door where they all  vanished behind and you hear clanging sounds like some sort of metal object or slab has fallen  solid onto flat ground  liam i start moving up through the hallway nott ja its still me im still invisible  you need to check that door i dont know if its trapped or  /none/ sam which door the door that i just checked or the next door  liam you checked a trap in this room didnt you  sam in the hallway that leads to the first chamber  marisha what about this door  liam

right in front of that  doorway you disabled it moved it out /none/ of the way and now you guys are looking at the door  liam i point invisibly and say the door that im pointing at that one  sam i dont see i dont know what youre saying waft your smell in the direction that  liam a gentle knock happens on the door in front of her  sam is that the door that i checked no yes  matt you didnt check the door you checked the room for traps and that was the trap you saw  sam oh the door the door okay ill check the /none/ door why dont you check the cage for these fellows  khary i was just thinking

look for any other triggers or passageways  ashly any objections to me trying to chop this door down is it made of wood i should ask first  matt it is made of wood it has some metal framing to /none/ it but its wooden primarily  liam ja i would prefer it we are blown anyway so have at it  ashly all right here we go  sam wait what about these people in the cage  khary yeah i was thinking maybe can i investigate these people that are in the cage  matt yeah you walk up to it and there are the two people the small child and the dwarf in the  previous chamber where you were locked and in the chamber you just discovered there appears to be an  older gentleman in his /none/ maybe late fifties early sixties or so looks pretty bruised up one eye is  swollen shut the other looks pretty bloodied as well hes chained from behind and has the gag in  his mouth as well  khary can i at least get in to move close enough that i could get the gag out of his mouth  matt yeah you go ahead and pull it free gasping panting who are you  khary were friends were going to get you out of here how are the bindings on your hands  matt they hurt you can /none/ see he looks weak he probably hasnt eaten well in a number of days as  part of the process of mentally conditioning those they capture its minimal sustenance and a lot of  mental and psychological damage as well as physical torture to go along with it youve seen  and endured some of it but looks like some of these other figures have gone through more of it  marisha i have one goodberry left over from nila that she gave me that i didnt eat so im going  to hand him the goodberry  matt well /none/ his hands are bound  marisha im going to feed him the goodberry  matt he looks at you with his one semigood eye and what what are

and just sadly eats the berry  marisha yeah  matt okay its not too bad  marisha antioxidants you know  matt açaí  khary whats your /none/ name friend  matt jusca  khary jusca  matt im just a farmer i dont know why they took me he pulls against the constraints from  behind can you get me out can you get me out please  liam we are just giving them time to be ready for us we need to proceed  ashly

his  body you rolled a  ashly /none/ an eight damage  matt an eight as you come down with your battleaxe you all hear the resounding crash as  it slams into the wood splintering and breaking it a bit you can see a brief gap where youve  managed to get two of the wooden boards to separate and start to splinter youre starting to  go full shining on this door with that impact over the next moment with repeated hits you  definitely can see your ability to cut through this  ashly okay can i do it again can i get through  /none/ matt yeah as thats happening the bindings are now freed and jusca brings his wrists up and rubs  them you can see where the strain has caused red bloodied lines across from the tension where hes  pulled against the restraints sallow this longbearded chin out of neglect he looks up with  a faint glimmer of hope and a smile to the rest of you and says oh tha thank you  khary hes still in the cage  matt still in the cage yes  khary still locked in the cage  matt yeah  khary should /none/ i try to unlock that thing  matt go for it roll a d20 plus your dex bonus and your proficiency bonus itd be plus six i think  khary six so 17  matt 17its going to take you a bit youre starting to get through it but these cages are  designed to be hard to pick you take the better part of a minute to do so in the meantime you  ashly so matt hypothetically if i rolled a critical failure trying to go shining on the door  what would happen  taliesin it would /none/ be very us  sam intermission  ashly in theory  matt in theory your axe goes wide and as opposed to hitting the actual wood manages to  catch a heavy part of the metal reinforcement on the door frame as it hits that heavy impact  sends reverberations through your arm and body like the worst  sam tinnitus  matt tennis elbow youve ever felt at that minute a voice familiar creeps in again in the  space around you what are you planning to accomplish youve killed a few bottombarrel  goons but youre in my /none/ domain now i had first planned to make you into premium contraband when  finished however i may just keep you all as my own personal pets make a wisdom saving throw  sam ugh  liam caleb is silently making the jerkoff motion in the room they are standing in  cheering  liam lets get this door open  ashly i have to make a saving throw matt  matt make a wisdom saving throw please  marisha oh no  sam youve got this  ashly come on baby character development 15  matt 15 okay in /town/ the moment the sense of intimidation that your previous employer lorenzo  had held over you and all the memories of what transpired on the glory run road not but a day  before goes running through your mind and you feel that cold sense of fear that urge to run  creep up once more and you close your eyes tightly and shrug it off for the first time in  the face of this  cheering  matt that driving surge of vengeful confidence beginning to burn in your belly once more  ashly i just got a /none/ little tearyeyed and i say eat shit fucko then i go for the door again  that is a 20 on the door  matt with your second swipe you bring both your battleaxe and your warhammer together in one giant  swing both splintering the wood and the force of the hammer splintering and breaking the two main  heavy wooden boards that hold the majority of the right side of the door by where the hinges hold it  on as you break through the door breaks on the top side and then swings open the apparatus  /none/ which keeps it there wedged in that door broken partway and now rendered pretty much useless the  chamber in front of you is now left open for you all to see where the three members both protto  ruzza and the third thug have vanished from the chamber you see a table on the far end and a  brazier burning with a low flame and then the stairway below has a set of bars like another  trap door that is a gate that seems to have closed and locked behind them  khary i like your fire /none/ keg  ashly panting thanks im going through some shit can we get this gate open  liam maybe nott will you have a look at it first  sam sure how you doing over there shakäste with the gates the cage  khary i think im almost there  matt all right at this point shakäste you do manage to finally get the final tumbler of this  one lock to tumblers clicking creaking it opens up and with that the older gentleman steps  out takes one step towards you and halfcollapses into your arms hes drained of /none/  energy thump  sam but that goodberry  khary yeah thats the only berry you got  marisha electrolytes  matt he rights himself hes not unconscious he just kind of stumbles and then gets back up and  leans against the wall breathing heavily  khary right there are a couple of people that are in the chamber around the corner here that are  also trapped how are you with a lockpick  sam laughs were deputizing the guy we just freed  khary you know hey man  matt he looks at you for about ten /none/ seconds blinking the one eye he can blink  khary never mind never mind thanks for  matt i i make radishes grow  laughter  sam well come back for them well come back for them  khary yeah i say

im sorry i try not to make eye contact they dont like it when i do  sam did you see a blue tiefling or a green sortofgradientcolored halforc and maybe an  amazinglooking white and sortof kindofblack dark angel thing  matt he looks to you first kind of still taken aback by the goblin face and the sharpened teeth  and the yellow eyes staring back but he calms himself /none/ uh i think those were the new projects  he took below  sam projects i dont like that  ashly weve got to move  liam caleb is already in the next room steering clear of the trap and trying to inspect if that  brazier is arcane in nature or if there is anything dangerous other than the trap  matt make an arcana check  liam ja  marisha while he does that im going to go immediately for the gate and look at that into  the stairs and see what the deal is  sam /none/ are you looking for traps or anything or just looking  marisha im going to investigate it and see how i can potentially open it if its locked yeah  matt all right so beau as you approach the gate and go to look towards it the brazier flame flickers  marisha i jump back  matt you do just as a gout of flame juts out in your direction  sam aah  liam if only i had gotten to say natural 20 before that happened  matt well you realize what it is just as it happens and /none/ youre like oh  liam oh thats one of those  matt whoosh a cone of flame just bursts forward from the brazier in your direction i need you to  make a dexterity saving throw please  marisha oh i rolled a two so nine  matt you take ten points of fire damage as it just incinerates past you and you take a step  back and the flame is now super small like it just expended a lot of its fire energy in the  brazier its just this low flicker and it begins to burn brighter /none/ again  marisha aah while its going im going to see if i can yank open the thing  matt all right go ahead and make a strength check  marisha whining can i do athletics  laughter  matt this is a straight strength check unfortunately sorry  sam um id prefer a nature check  matt just roll a d20 add your  marisha singing dont fuck me  marisha and audience gil  marisha mm 15  matt 15  marisha yeah  matt creaking it begins to bend you can see now where theyve left it /none/ to lock behind it  latches when its dropped and where the latch has stuck in its been locked underneath its  starting to pull apart the metal is bending its not strong enough to break it will take another  round to do so but its starting to give  ashly im going to rush forward and help do the same thing  matt all right  liam and am i aware of that the trap what sets it off since i got the natural 20  matt yes proximity  liam proximity alone  ashly um nervous laugh /none/  matt so go ahead and make a strength check  marisha grunting  ashly okay  marisha im still trying to help  ashly 21  matt 21 beau as youre pulling your muscles getting sore that the veins bulging in your arms  and your neck as youre yanking as hard as you can  marisha grunting keg do i look buff  ashly grunting yeah yeah you look great  marisha grunting thank you  matt keg joins in with you and both of you ping  ashly do i look buff  matt the latches break /none/ off and it slides open hitting the back wall leaving the stairs below  open this warm air is billowing up from beneath at which point i need both of you to make a  dexterity saving throw as the brazier now has regained its flame and then whoosh sends forth  another blast  ashly 19  marisha 12  matt all right so you succeed beau unfortunately you do not so thats going to be 12  points of fire damage to you beau six points to you  ashly aah i still get burned  matt you /none/ take half damage though and you watch as the flame now turns to a small cinder and  begins to rumble rise once more regenerating its flame power  sam is it the brazier its in the wall its inside the wall  matt there is a stone bowl of some kind that is in a small pedestal that looks decorative on the  corner that contains a small ember but the ember itself seems to be magical and whenever anybody  walks within a certain distance of it it just sends a gout of flame in their direction  /none/ sam can i mage hand grab it and throw the bowl across the room  matt well first off you both are in proximity you have the stairs below what are you doing  ashly are we dexing it down right  marisha we drop down  matt all right both beau and keg vanish down the stairs just as the flames roar over the  direction they were but it passes overhead without any harm youve managed to pull out of  the range of this brazier nott  sam that looks like a big bowl i dont know /none/  matt its pretty large  sam i dont think i can lift that  matt and it looks like the stone bowl itself is probably built into the pillar it would weigh far  too much for your mage hand to move  sam how do we get down there without the fire thing happening again ah oh wait caleb  are you in the room  liam i am in the room there are a couple of options i could dispel it it would take me about  ten minutes i would no longer be invisible we would /none/ lose time  sam ten minutes no  liam the second option is that we

of  whats inside  marisha silver linings  matt theres this unnatural heat that fills the interior of this chamber the air smells of coal  and burnt flesh  sam the map looks like a cock and balls  laughter cheering  liam spoilers  matt hopefully not proportionally thatd be a little sad  sam have you seen me you can see me  khary from what ive heard you know its all about girth so  liam scanlans gone man scanlans gone  matt /none/ you can see a number of metal brands hanging against some of the walls where they are carried  over to these furnaces to be heated as torture implements further into the central chamber you  see a table you see in the middle of this rounded chamber flanked by empty chairs this  stained stretch leathertopped table leather draping over on each side almost to the floor you  see heavy chains dangling at the front and the back of it as this is probably a location where  individuals are strapped to and tortured two sets of prison /none/ barred doors flank the opposite ends  that seem to have larger containment chambers beyond there they look to be heavy and very  locked and barred what would you like to do  khary id like for the duchess to come back and perch on my shoulder frankly  matt okay duchess heads back up  ashly well its not like they dont know were coming  sam so we are inside the weve lifted open the hatch right theres no other doors going

could send  khary sidebar rich little was an impressionist from the 70s and 80s kids thank you  sam i could send down an image of you that looks like you and so if they attack right away theyll  be fighting against just an illusion  ashly thats not a bad idea  sam thank you  ashly thanks nott what /none/ do we think about that  liam thats a pretty impressive illusion  khary i like the idea of sussing them out since theyre obviously hiding down there because from  what the duchess saw she saw the chamber but no one was in it  marisha i agree  liam you are able to do something so substantial  sam not of substance if thats what you mean by substantial wherever you are  liam im right in front of you  sam okay  liam im right in front of you im talking about  sam kiss  /none/ laughter  sam i

keg  ashly 11  marisha yay  sam its middling  marisha above average  matt you angle yourself at the top of the stairway to make sure that the sound of your armor  shaking  ashly what the fuck  matt at least disseminates into the air as much as possible the image can only walk 15 feet  because that is the distance of the cube so the illusion appears near the top or near the middle  of the stairs  khary theres a bit of an echo right  matt /none/ descends and steps no more than ten feet out from that and stops  sam okay and starts like narrowing its eyes and looking around just sort of mean and maybe gets a  cigarette i dont know how she has so many of them does she roll them i dont know  ashly its just the same one  matt at this moment you hear projectiles firing and you see as a bit of the dangling  leather over the table bows slightly and from the opposite end something darts across the hallway  sam from which side  /none/ matt one appears to emerge from underneath the table out this way another seems to shoot out  from this side  ashly what shoots out  khary this is some indiana jones shit thats happening right now  sam the image of keg falls to the floor clutching her shoulder  taliesin i can make it sound im going to use thaumaturgy to make it sound like shes in pain so  ashly groans oh it hurts  taliesin im holding the crystal up like a microphone  ashly aw shit  taliesin

lot of im going  to need a palette to work with  ashly ah aw agh  laughter  matt a moment passes before two more projectiles fire these strange quick objects moving at a  rapid speed cross by another one hits the bottom of the stairs and clangs to a rest this one you  can actually see it it appears to be a /none/ rather long solid crossbow bolt  sam okay i make kegs hand fall off  laughter  sam ah

trap is it because theres no weight to your illusion what would  have been set off  marisha its motionsensored  sam it could be someone under the table  khary no its not a motion sensor they see it  liam no its a person firing  khary they see it theres somebody watching  liam its a person firing  sam yes its someone  marisha its protto  khary where are those shots coming from  sam from under the table and also from somewhere else  marisha maybe /none/ its protto and that lackey  sam well we know that protto shoots arrows right and then someone else could be the other one  marisha and then they had that hired hand with them  sam yeah yeah yeah thats them  ashly would we be able to see anything to make perception checks from here  matt not up in the stairway youd have to descend into the

perception check as well since youre both at the wall  ashly come on baby singing 20  cheering  marisha thank the gods  liam what are you  matt keg as you hit the wall and glance around the side you can see a humanoid shape ducked into  the shadows underneath the table in the center who has pulled a heavy crossbow from underneath  the leather and aiming it at nott which does attempt to shoot that is a 17 to hit whats your  armor /none/ class  sam it hits  matt it hits for that nott you take eight points of piercing damage as a bolt hits right  towards the kneecap and actually sticks out the side you almost falling to one edge  sam i will dodge uncannily  matt there you go reduce that to four caduceus as you walked around the corner you turn around  to see and come face to face with ruzza who is back up against the corner and looks towards you  and goes what the fuck  taliesin do i have time to do /none/ a thing  matt no now we roll initiative  taliesin okay  matt unveiling this guys

by the way there you are right there  thank you five  matt what did you get shakäste  khary four  matt ohh all righty oh man first with a natural 20 on initiative order is protto what at  first you thought was the thugs placement over there turns out to be protto who immediately  throws the table up and in front using it as a block and as cover and then aims over again with  the heavy crossbow firing once again at nott thats a 23 to hit  sam thats a very big /none/ hit  matt its only four piercing damage however really shitty damage roll  sam four piercing damage can i also uncanny dodge that or no  matt yeah were going back to the next combat round you technically have not gotten your  reaction yet so no  sam you know what i wont just in case i want to react to something else  matt well that finishes prottos turn nott youre up  sam did protto duck or anything  matt yeah protto is currently now behind the table and using it as cover  sam so /none/ i cannot see the devil wears prada  matt no you cannot  taliesin i was waiting for that  matt it was only a matter of time  sam okay i will run over to the table and poke over it and shoot protto  cheering and laughter  matt as you rush up and glance over you can see protto back against the table  sam hello  matt pulling and stretching a bolt and goes huh  marisha come on come on girl  khary come on  sam 12  matt no  marisha aw  /none/ sam im going to fuck you up oh shit  laughter  matt he instinctually slaps his hand up and it knocks your arm and it causes the shot to go  firing off into the distance  sam i will reload and fire again  matt all right go for it  sam thats 20  matt thatll hit thatll hit  sam aw thats cocked okay ten points of damage  matt ten points of damage this one sinks deep into the left pectoral muscle of protto piercing  through the armor and then gets stuck you hear /none/ this expiring bit of air from the throat and he  seems like hes now having a hard time breathing hes hurt hes not at deaths door but hes  looking pretty hurt all righty nott  sam ill duck down  matt that ends your turn beau youre up  marisha okay  sam chanting bbbeau  marisha air horn im going to pop around the corner pop around and im going to go towards  where nott is keep going do i see anybody to my left  matt you do you see the other thug immediately around /none/ that corner who is also firing from that  side across the way  marisha i go sup pow  laughter  marisha okay first roll natural 20  cheering  marisha doubling the dice damage ooh thats a seven so 14 plus four 18  matt 18 points of damage to him nice all righty so with a heavy clock to the side he gets  thrown back into a torch that is in the wall that catches flame a little bit on his shoulder  and he brushes it out he is looking both distracted and pretty hurt /none/  marisha thats cool im going to take my off hand im going to run and just take the edge of  my arm into his throat  matt go for it second strike  marisha second strike 14  matt 14 does hit  ashly oh yes  matt actually because he is just a lowly guy he is not as well armored as his compatriots so  marisha not great damage six damage  matt six damage whack to the throat gasping hes now having a hard time inhaling hes still  standing but  marisha okay im /none/ going to take palm to his nose and try and bat his head back into that sconce  behind him  sam good god  khary come on girl  marisha last hit last hit thats not good 12  sam thats great  matt 12 does not hit unfortunately  sam oh thats not good  matt you go to hit a third time and hes a little wiser and manages to push off its a sloppy parry  but he manages to avoid most of the brunt of the blow and pulls back that end your turn  /none/ marisha yep im going to stay here and just be on this guy  matt all right that brings us to caleb and keg  ashly okay  matt you guys can choose who goes first  ashly after you  liam ah ja okay i think  ashly unless i can go first if you want  liam im already gone in my head i think this is still going very well i have not been hit  here we go and im at the bottom of the stairs already not at the top so what i would like /none/ to  do is move my full movement and then use my action to dash and just stroll to the right of nott and  i will just touch her on the shoulder as i go and get as far as i can in that direction against the  wall if thats as far as i can get so 60 feet  matt you can get all the way over here  liam ja thats exactly where i want to be and then i will scooch down not fully sitting but  like bending my knees down and doing like /none/ a squat and thinking this is okay this is okay thats  the end of the turn  matt all right  marisha youre in full poop stance  ashly so now me  sam squatty potty  liam typically  ashly can i get to protto  matt protto counting you kick a chair to get there but you can get right up against him  ashly i say hey little shit and then i whack him thats a natural one  matt you swing with the battleaxe and it actually gets wedged into the table you have to /none/ put your  foot on to manage to free it from the wood  ashly all right trying again okay that is a 19  matt 19 does hit go ahead and roll damage  ashly yes okay great okay so that is seven damage  matt seven points of damage to protto with the warhammer whack to the side of his head hes  pushed up against the side of the now partiallysplintered table but he is still  keeping his cool about him hes hurt but hanging in there  ashly i cant smack him again with the /none/ bonus action  matt with your bonus action you can yeah  ashly oh well then im going to fucking do that  matt youre a dual wielder you got this girl  ashly ah does that 15  matt does not it just misses unfortunately protto manages to just duck out of the way as your  hammer slams into the bottom side of the table where he has been using to break for cover and it  causes this huge open hole this gap almost like a porthole in the top of the table where you can  /none/ see through as you manage to pull back your hammer he kind of looks up through it right at  nott aah  sam aah  matt that finish your turn keg  ashly yes  matt all righty you now hear once again a familiar voice  audience no  matt crawls from the space that says  marisha quietly this fucking sucks right  khary whispering i hate him  matt do not kill them they have not earned the mercy i give to their kaleidoscopic friends let  them bleed and bring them in chains oh the /none/ horrors youll see and for lorenzos turn  jeering  sam oh lorenzo he has such good mic technique  laughter  matt beau you hear this momentary vibration of metal cutting through the air before that is  going to be a 20 to hit  marisha yep that hits  matt that is 17 points of slashing damage  audience oh  khary you have aid  marisha yeah  matt and 16 to hit  marisha miss the second one  matt so the first one strikes from behind the pain shoots into your head and the /none/ second swing is  a backhanded wide throw with this glave now seemingly more jagged and almost larger than the  one you saw before you manage to duck out of the way and spin around and there hovering in the  air about ten feet off the ground you see what seems to be the essence of lorenzo but larger  you see in that same kind of thickened leatherstudded bits of armor and bracers a  bulging muscular blueskinned body where once was a bulging bald head with tattoo two horns  emerge from the front bits of /none/ a blackened beard on once was a hairless humanoid form now curling  down the front of the chest and back of the head one central plume behind you see there before you  what is lorenzo or at least his true form  sam and audience oh  shouts and jeers  matt and as you look up into the burning red eyes of this strange ogreishlike demon creature which  you do not recognize all you hear is the chuckle malicious chuckle  sam jesus  matt as he flies back further into the chamber about 15 feet /none/ up his back to the ceiling of the  interior thats going to end lorenzos turn it is now ruzzas turn ruzza who saw you first run  over there caduceus is going attempt to cast confusion on you so i need you caduceus to make  a wisdom saving throw  taliesin a wisdom saving throw thats a 27  ashly yes  cheering  matt as you watch ruzza begin to slightly hum this incantation there is a musical element that  is discordant and awful that seems to pierce through your ears and into your brain for /none/ a  second your vision blurs the colors fade to gray up is down the world makes no sense and as you  clasp your eyes tight once more you manage to shrug off the magical effect you look back at  ruzza who notices that the spell has faded and goes oh shit  taliesin laughing ah  khary he hasnt been the same since he left the fugees  matt and ruzza is going to run the other direction to try and get away from you thats  going to end ruzzas turn that brings us now to /none/ the other thug the one that is up against you  marisha oh i thought you said the other fuck and i was like he is a fuck  matt you know that thug is going to  marisha still heard it same thing keep going  matt is going to attempt to

came from and at that moment /none/ the second crossbow bolt goes right into  the throat she opens her mouth trying to make a sound and instead nothing but blood pours out of  the corner  sam ill just say  marisha yeah  ashly hell yeah  cheering  sam bards suck  laughter  sam ill just back up even further  matt youll back up a little bit you said  sam back up even further away from any danger  matt

you can go in /none/ either direction  liam if i go to the right will i clear out of that flying guys line of sight  matt you have two more spaces you can go near caduceus  liam yeah im going to cut directly right towards caduceus and just before i disappear out  of view im going to say hey hows your day and i will send a fire bolt at lorenzo  matt roll for the attack  liam ja eh its not that great its a 16  matt all righty that does hit exactly  cheering  taliesin well /none/ this has been exciting  liam okay thats good thats also good so 14 points of fire damage  matt flames burst across you see the leather cracks in one part of the harness he just grins  back at you  liam ja and then hopefully im disappearing around the corner and leaning my face against the  wall like that  matt that ends your turn keg  ashly im rushing and im jumping on top of the table  sam this table man  ashly its the centerpiece of our attack plan is that enough  marisha /none/ oh my god keg this is just like titanic just me and you floating on this  ashly keg is in love its gone past just arousal can i reach lorenzo from the table  matt possibly yeah you give a little jump as you swing hes just in reach with the tables help  ashly okay here we go 18  matt 18 hits  ashly thats six  matt six points of damage nice  ashly here we go again on my own that will not hit and one more time for the cheap seats that  will /none/ not hit okay go ahead  matt aw but you still get one swing that cuts through and carves through part of the outer leg  and calf of lorenzo the leg gets pushed back a bit from the impact as hes floating his large  almostcorpulent form though of solid muscle just sitting there enduring it his face focus  comes from where caleb was back towards you and says well glad you could join the party keg  that ends your turn  ashly yes  matt that makes it lorenzos turn  audience no  sam hes /none/ going to decide to turn over a new leaf and  taliesin manage a bed bath  beyond its going to be nice  sam yeah sure  marisha he gets into real estate  sam yeah gets his license on the second try  laughter  ashly theres so much thinking when lorenzos turn comes up and its very scary  marisha do i get a thing  matt no youve got to jump to hit him but hes not within your melee range when youre standing  groaning  taliesin why are we standing next to each other /none/  sam you guys tried  taliesin oh wait once hes within 15 feet of me he gets half speed oh no hes not walking  matt spirit guardian still slows his movement i believe does it say walking speed or just walking  taliesin once he enters the field he also i believe  matt has to make a wisdom save which is a 12 plus four 16  taliesin 16 is the  matt so take half damage roll for damage he still takes damage you also watch as lorenzo  coasts through the air some of the /none/ wounds that he suffered seem to be slowly sealing up  ashly oh come on  sam god this guy matt theres an audience here that deserves a certain amount of death and payoff  taliesin 18 so half of 18 its radiant damage is radiant damage doing anything to him  matt nothing more than just terrible radiant damage  taliesin okay  matt it blasts him and as he pulls into the area he goes ooh thats not going to do and vanishes  marisha no why  matt caduceus its your turn  taliesin hmm  liam /none/ im having raishan flashbacks  taliesin im having a little regret that i didnt pack that faerie fire man  audience aw  taliesin who knew i was drinking tea last time i got to pick spells  marisha faerie fire is one of the best fucking spells man  taliesin im curious about these rooms back here those grates that youve still got covered over  whats over there  matt i dont know do you want to go see  taliesin yeah i want to run over there  sam wait youre looting  taliesin im going to /none/ run over there  matt thats your movement can get you that close you can use your action to make a perception check  if you want to glare through  taliesin itll get me that close i would like to be a little further away so that i am not in blast  radius with two other people  matt there  taliesin yeah looks to be a little better darn it yeah im going to use my action to  matt make a perception check with disadvantage because there is no light source inside that  chamber and /none/ you do not have darkvision which i remembered  sam stage whisper liam dont you have a potion or something  liam ja  matt make your roll  sam i mean cooing  taliesin 15  matt 15 looking through its hard to see but you can make out a few shapes they look to be  humanoid figures that are still gagged and chained on the farback side of the interior there  taliesin okay im going to turn back around that was my action to take a look in there  matt yeah youre peering in very /none/ closely to try and make out the details of an area with no light  source in the middle of combat  taliesin aw man okay thats my turn  matt okay  sam weirdly the map looks even more like my penis now  matt you should really get that checked out sam all right finishing caduceuss turn shakäste  youre up  khary all right i guess shakäste and the duchess will move into the chamber and check the other  side of this chamber now that its  matt whereabouts do you want to go  khary /none/ as far to the other side of this penis as we can get yeah  matt thats about as far as you can get with your movement  khary have the duchess follow me as well go ahead and go to the end of the chamber there  matt right over here  khary yeah and perch there can she see inside  matt make a perception check for the duchess with a disadvantage  khary yes it is its at disadvantage  matt actually no we decided that the duchess design had darkvision so just a straight roll  /none/ whatever you rolled  liam seven plus  khary 11  matt its hard to make out anything in there  khary hard to see in there  matt there is a chamber in there but theres not enough light to make out the details of it  unfortunately does that finish your turn you can move your nefertiti if youd like  laughter  khary you know why dont you hang back is there any light in that chamber that thaumaturgy could  maybe illuminate  matt there is a candelabra that has low light over there that is /none/ giving a faint glow and there  are two torches in the sides here that are also giving off this low redorange  khary but nothing in the room  matt nothing in the room no  khary we might as well thaumaturgy to see if we can make a little more light in the room  matt as you do so the flames flare up and the long shadows stretch from beyond the bars into the  chamber and you can see an unconscious figure on the far back end that is also in full manacles  chained and /none/ gagged facing away from you you cant see any more details than that  khary thats really all ive got i cant start working on these locks at all can i  matt not with using thaumaturgy as your action no  khary all right there you go  matt that finishes your turn back to the top nott what are you doing  sam me im going to peek around the corner do i see anything or anyone to attack  matt you dont see anybody in there you could make a perception check if you want to use /none/ that as  your action its up to you  sam no i will stay tucked in my little closet is there a way i can hide but still see around the  corner no  matt maybe roll a high stealth check maybe well see  sam nope i mean 15 its decent  matt good to know  sam ill just hold my action until i see something  matt okay good to know what are you

right ill give it a go  matt so you use your action /none/ to make a perception check  ashly that is 18  matt you just looking over your shoulder see some sort of shift across the stone like the  pattern just moves and quakes ever so faintly unnaturally against what would be the rather still  though warm air  ashly right next to me  matt no in the back of the chamber right here thats your action  ashly okay  sam use your bow and arrow  ashly i have a javelin  sam ooh  ashly i could try to javelin  sam yeah  ashly /none/ shall i try to javelin  sam yeah  ashly okay here we go 17  matt

direction telling the group  what do you tell them  ashly i think theres something spooky happening on the stone over here  sam oh no ghosts  matt as keg walks forward pointing in that direction a familiar voice rings out right before  you and says oh little girl youre making crafting this nightmare too easy /none/ with that  theres this curl of blueish arcane energy right before you your hair begins to blow back from the  force as a cold temperature begins to gather directly ahead with that in a brief instant  lorenzo appears before you in his large demonic form and unleashes  marisha do i

running it worked i watch it leave my finger and take an impossible  spiralling trajectory through the air and hes so preoccupied with that charming dwarf woman with  the stubble it takes him in the back of the head and it starts to burn through the back of his  skull and eat away through the back of his head and burn through his eyes  cheering  ashly what the fuck  matt you watch as lorenzo in desperation begins to take flight both /none/ you and beau try and swing  for his form but it doesnt matter at this point as he attempts to try and make for an exit the  flames curl across the body leaving ash dissipating as the outer sides of his form begin  to fall away into dust and blackened shale as both of your weapons and fists swing upward they  hit what feels like rock and scatter it like ash against both sides of the walls the torso falls  and tumbles to the ground one arm still dragging lorenzo towards the stairs in this /none/ last minute bit  of desperation before it tumbles onto its back the flame curling and burning away the rest of his  face and jaw the hand left there limp before that eventually is taken too leaving nothing  but charred charcoal behind  cheering  liam you shouldnt have killed my cat  laughter  matt one tactical fuck up on his part and that stunning strike turned that completely around  cheering  taliesin monks man  khary i need a drink  taliesin hey welcome back  ashly keg just falls to her knees and starts /none/ crying  sam i go get some of the ash off the ground and give it to mr clay and say maybe you could make  some tea with this

taliesin 16  matt definitely dont want to make tea from this  taliesin i figured  matt there are certain creatures that /none/ are you would assume distantly related to giant kin  youre used to seeing the ogreish mighty beasts this was something entirely different youve  heard terms thrown around like ogre mage but this is commonly referred to in childrens nursery  rhymes the kind that are meant to scare kids from going out at night as an oni  taliesin i dont know if theres much we can do with this this is a bit yeah no you dont  want to drink that lets sweep that away why dont we  marisha beau is going to immediately run /dung/ over here to this undiscovered prison ballsack region  sam theres four balls on this dick  matt you glance inside that additional chamber and you can now see within that chamber there is  a singular figure on the opposite side of the wall chained up your eyes adjust and you pull  the candelabra close and you can see the familiar dark gray leather and white hair of a chained and  unconscious yasha on the far end  cheering  taliesin im going to try and start figuring out how to open that other gate that im /none/ next to  matt go ahead and make a check do you
