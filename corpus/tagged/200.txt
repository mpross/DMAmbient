make the beat drop  matt now  sam okay here we /none/ go  matt the party of vox machina having traveled across taldorei to the city of whitestone to seek  a pair of seemingly vicious and evil individuals known as lord and lady briarwood members of the  past that percys family fell to oh so many years ago leaving what he thought was the sole survivor  to the de rolo family upon coming to whitestone finding its people downtrodden and oppressed by  the briarwood rule as well as the cutthroats and mercenaries that they had brought along with  them when they took the city now given /town/ lordship and plots of land and rule over this entire town  the word began to spread of possible new rebellion as you charged through the town leaving burned  marks burned houses and very slaughtered people in the process very bad people as these murmurs  continue to roll and coalesce you spoke to a number of individuals in the city that were  involved in previous failed rebellions and seemed to build up what may be the last chance for  whitestone as part of this information was revealed that percys thoughtdead sister  cassandra still existed within /none/ the castle and had been what people thought the only living de rolo  and bastion of hope in the city now there were two  upon triggering the initiation of this the party split scanlan shorthalt running to one of the  nobles while the rest of the party went to the other to set a diversion at the same time  laughs it may not have worked out as intended but it definitely worked as we had an epic bard  versus goliath rainstorm rooftop showdown the rest of the party made their way into count  tylieris /town/ home destroyed his vampiric self and got some information out of the guards before  escaping into the town which has now gone into chaos  many of townsfolk have become the militia that theyve been preparing to be armored with  whatever they can find theyve managed to take down a number of the large hulking zombie giant  guardians throughout the city many lives were lost in the process and the battle is ongoing as  you rushed towards the center of the town to check in on the sun tree finding all the previous  bodies that /dung/ resembled members of vox machina cut from its boughs you saw swarming in towards the  center of the city a large horde of skeletal undead clattering forth into the dark  as the sun has now set over the horizon the rain beginning to pour heavily into the center of the  town there was efforts meant to keep the army at bay as you all rushed towards the west to escape  the immediate fray and that was where we left off last session  sam shit  travis we fucking run  laura are we still running /town/ are we still running away  sam we just got to the tree line right  matt you guys havent gotten to the tree line yet no  sam oh jesus  taliesin we are still running  laura were heading out of town  travis theres a shitload of skeletons behind us  laura are they right behind us im still riding trinket  matt at this time you are on trinket the rest of you are running through the muddy streets your  feet are slick against the ground and you have to catch yourself every now and /town/ then from not  tumbling forward  travis dust of tracelessness  laura are the skeletons still behind us can we see them  matt as you glance over theyre just now starting to pour from the town square itself and  it was hard to see the exact number but from your perspective in the darkened kind of just  postsunset light you didnt see the end of it  taliesin whoa triple digits  matt possibly from what you can tell in the middle of the chaos from rushing there was a zombie  giant behind you that /town/ did manage to finish off some of the villagers before coming after you in  your haste in escape with the help of a few of you individuals who managed to tear it down  slaughtering it as it gave chase through the city street  as you guys are now looking behind and seeing this undead horde pouring into the central road that  youre traveling along you hear a voice ring out from the other direction toward where you guys  are running for a second its hard to make out what it is but the voice is /none/ suddenly readily  familiar it says there run aid them  and as you guys glance away from the army and back towards the path where you were traveling you see  what looks to be about ten armed villagers various pieces of armor some nicer than others  some have seen some use over time but nevertheless serviceable and functional you see  at the front of them brother yennan sorry keeper yennan is at the front of them armored up  shield at his side holding aloft the holy symbol of erathis in his hand and theyre all /none/ just  running towards you guys heavy footfalls  marisha we cant leave  laura can i trail behind on trinket and try to cast conjure barrage at the incoming skeletons  matt youd probably have to slow down to do that because youre a good like probably 50 60 feet  away from them if not a little further you guys are moving faster than them so that even the  chase theyre not very quick entities  liam so were 50 or 60 feet away from the skeletons and how far are we away from the  villagers /town/ that are coming in the other direction  matt theyre about a hundred feet from you and closing  travis i would advise bringing them with us instead of stopping  laura but all the villagers that arent in armor are still in town  travis shit happens  marisha im running back im going back towards the skeletons  laura i was carrying you youre on trinket with me arent you can he carry both of us  liam no i was pulling her by the arm  marisha i break from vaxs grasp and start running back  /none/ matt go ahead and make this is technically breaking a grapple  laura i do want to trail back a little on trinket and try to cast conjure barrage as were running  matt okay so so trinket begins to turn around youre fighting it would be either acrobatics or  athletics versus your athletics  marisha athletics ooh i rolled an 18  sam five  matt with that the slick rain across her forearm swish she squeaks her arm out from your grasp  and with that moment you feel her disappear as she rushes back towards this /none/ undead onslaught  sam you never could keep a lady  laughter  liam i immediately pivot around and follow  taliesin ditto  marisha i start conjuring up a 4thlevel flaming sphere  matt keep in mind you still have call lightning coming so you would be losing the call lightning  at this time  marisha flaming sphere  matt okay so with that the darkened clouds that had gathered begin to slowly disperse as you begin  to focus running forward as you are charging using the momentum the air around you begins to  slowly grow /town/ and ignite before a ball of flame bursts into your peripheral and you can control  it at will  marisha okay how far away is the horde  matt at this point now theyre about 30 feet away since you went right back towards them as  opposed to running away  laura am i in front of her  matt youre now because you gave chase shortly after she ran off so you guys are about tandem  marisha okay heres my question are they funneling down one main street how wide is that  street  matt /none/ about 20 feet  marisha okay with my flaming sphere hovering above me im going to throw up a wall of stone  laura okay wait not before i shoot my conjure barrage because i said i wanted to fucking do it  before you did that  marisha conjure a barrage first  matt all right so conjure barrage  laura laughs dont fucking block my arrows  matt what whats the distance on conjure barrage  laura i think its a 60foot cone  matt okay then yeah you can definitely attempt that okay so as you create /none/ this sphere and  its rolling to your side as you begin to concentrate and look over your shoulder and you  see trinket heavy steps running up with just mud slung as each one of his claws begins digging  into the earth pulling him forward bear roars on his back you see vex pull out an arrow pull  back and concentrate the arrow itself seems to split and shatter in her hand almost like the  wood itself divides into five or six different shards as you release the arrow it bursts into a  funneling cloud /none/ of sharp wooden splinters that fires out from the front of you whats the dc on  that spell  laura it would be 15  matt 15 dc and is that dex  laura dexterity yeah  matt dexterity all righty  liam hes just got to roll for a hundred skeletons  laura i know no problem  matt the ones that are in range would be about 12 at that point  marisha scoffs only 12  matt okay given the average of rolls there the explosion of splinters just shoots outward just  completely disintegrating the /none/ first row of about five or six of them about five or six past them  get a bunch of splinter in their bone their rib cages shatter open and they skeletal gargle try  and move forward before they collapse in on their own structure and clatter scatter into the mud  lets say you destroyed ten of them  laura okay  matt you can still see about 50 or 60 slow pushing towards you at this point in time  keyleth  marisha okay i throw up a wall of stone am i near the sun tree /town/ again  laura weve left the sun tree  matt you guys left the sun tree and youve gone westward it would be from your perspective  westward across the city towards the treeline  sam and now were doubling back  matt youre now doubling back at this point however the undead horde has filtered into the  town square and is currently between you and the sun tree  marisha okay so what im going to do is i want to conjure it from underneath me so as i see them  filtering up i want to pop /town/ it up right from underneath me to where im on top of it  matt okay and the width of its going to cover the entire street okay swoosh the wall of  stone lifts you up at its maximum height whats the maximum height of that spell  travis keep that cast hand feeling firm  marisha ten feet  laura the hand went down the spell went away  marisha ten foot by ten foot panels  matt can you repeat that i lost my phone for my app so im going to use this book here  /none/ so ten feet  marisha ten feet  matt all right so whoosh youre lifted ten feet up into the air you can now see about to  crash into the wall what looks 70 or so skeletons just crashing noise scraping into it you guys  can all of a sudden hear through the rainfall in the distance this scratching of metal shields and  blades and bones scraping at the stone wall and skeletal hissing hissing and clattering  marisha so im going to take the fire sphere and just start funneling it right down and start  /none/ cleaning house  matt okay  laura beyond the wall  marisha just yeah right into the thick mess of them  matt okay the flaming sphere begins to move over the wall youve done your action and you begin  to push that forward because the sphere moving through you would get to about your space so next  turn well get to that you guys have caught up to the wall now the rest of you have turned around  with her  sam yeah i ran for a few more feet and then i looked around and /none/ no one else was running with me  so i turned around and restarted running back with my little gnome legs panting  matt okay percy  taliesin im climbing the wall  liam climbing the wall  matt okay you guys get up on top of the wall its about four or five feet thick its a little  precarious but not too much to really bother you guys  you get to the top and you look over and you see this sea of thrashing about skeletal entities  some looking fresher than others and all intent on /none/ trying to find some way and you start to see  some of them starting to climb up over each other to get to the height of the wall  taliesin im just going to hold and anybody who gets too close im just going to take a shot at  anything that gets too close  matt okay  travis can you see any giants from up there  taliesin can i see any giants from up there  matt make a perception check  sam while hes doing that im yelling at grog grog throw me up over /none/ the wall  at least to the top  taliesin i rolled a perception of ten  matt the rainfall is too thick right now your vision is so obscured that even beyond 50 60 feet  it starts getting a little hard to make out details  travis are you sure  liam i turn back towards the villagers who are probably running up at this point and yell fire  bring fire  matt the keeper says fire wont help but i can  sam and laura oh  taliesin whoa  matt and so can she as /none/ he looks over his shoulder you can see the villagers are parting  and there is running behind them this form of a small humanoid armored entity but glowing her  actual form is comprised of glowing radiant energy like an actual avatar of sarenrae in the  form of a tiny gnome cleric just charging through the rain each droplet of rain that hits her body  sizzling just immediately evaporates on impact and she comes charging towards you guys  taliesin im reaching down to help her up on the top of the wall  marisha oh my /none/ god keyleth thinks she died keyleth thinks shes dead  liam im grabbing percys arm and lowering him down lower because shes short  matt all right as you guys reach down and she runs up keeper yennan reaches up and grabs on the  arm as well as she gets up and the two of them together lift up on top and as you grab her arm  its strange its warm to the touch warmer than a natural arm and it doesnt have full physical  essence to it its almost like shes partially an apparition of her /none/ physical self there is  purchase there is an actual form to it but it doesnt feel fully solid  sam shes lost weight  laughter  taliesin you look so thin  matt with that you lift her up and shes lighter than you recall and almost like a gentle  feather of herself she light footfall lands onto her toes on the top of the wall  liam she was light already  matt i know  laura pike  ashley hi  laura hi  marisha pike did we die  ashley no youre still alive  /none/ liam how did you get here what are you doing here how did you get here  ashley oh gosh its a long story i dont know if we can talk about it right now  laughter  ashley do we need to fight anything right now  laura there are lots of skeletons  matt yeah as you look down before you and there is a horde of skeletons that are right now about  to crush the wall you see two right now that are lashing out one reaches for your leg  taliesin im taking a shot /none/  matt okay go for it  ashley lets talk later  laura can i have trinket lift me stand up on his hind legs and up against the wall  so i can climb up  taliesin i percyd  sam you broke the gun  marisha no he critted  taliesin i didnt wheaton come on i percyd  matt all right go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats a 20  matt whoever sent in that d20  sam its weighted  taliesin it must be oh its hollow nine 15 points of damage  matt /town/ with the rocketing blast sound the pepperbox fires and the skeleton in front of you  just explodes into splinters of bone just being scattered amongst the crowd of skeletons  behind it however the moment that that one is gone another one seems to already be crawling  into its place  taliesin whatever youre going to do do it im firing again  matt okay fire again  taliesin 24  matt what is it 24  taliesin 24 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage gunshot it fires and blasts off most of the /none/ skull on the skeleton and  you can see its jaw hangs open but it still skeletal hiss  taliesin firing one more time at it that hit 15 27 seven points of damage  matt okay that one you clearly destroy the top of its skull the rest of it just crumples into  the pile and disperses amongst the chaos the horde though is now as almost like a wave  theres so much of it thats pushing up against the wall and beginning to swell up to reach the  top of the tenfoot wall the flaming /none/ sphere rolls over the top and slams down into the front of the  group as it hits and impacts go ahead and roll the damage  marisha i cast it at 4thlevel so its doing 5d6 right now  matt all righty and whats the  marisha they have to make dexterity saving throws  matt okay  marisha oh really  taliesin wow  matt one three nine 20 one im doing general rolls for this it pushes through ten of them  seven of them are destroyed the bone cinders and burns and then crumples into itself /none/ a few of  them manage to push out of the way kind of growls watching as it rolls past you can hear  this constant pattering of rain evaporating against the flaming sphere sizzling as it pushes  through the mud boiling left in its wake as thats happening you get up to the top trinket  pushes you up on the top  laura yeah i want to shoot lightning arrow down into the core of it that i can see just a big  group of them  matt okay go for it  laura okay  /none/ sam i want to go up there pikes up there  laura 16  matt 16 16 definitely hits yeah  laura okay and then thats sorry 2d8 i cant add 4d8 there we go 19  matt 19 damage  laura yeah  matt okay so the first one takes full damage impact noise explodes as the lightning arcs  through the air the arrow hitting the central skeleton you see the light actually burst into  the back of its skull causing this blueishgreen glow to shoot out of its eyes and mouth as it  explodes and /none/ detonates  laura everything within ten feet  matt exactly ten feet total that would be wow  taliesin 16  matt yeah laughs general saves on this im rolling for shit  taliesin yeah you are  matt all right so with that blast the shock wave blasts outward and you see skeletons being  thrown pieces of skeletons arms and weapons and pieces of shield and armor being flung in the air  as you see 12 of them immediately disintegrate and explode around it in that moment though the  horde pushes again and fills that gap /none/ almost instantly you do see the end of it now at this  point it looks to be probably a total of 65 left in this section roll a perception check  laura aw that looked like it was going to be awesome 11  matt 11 okay dont worry about it  travis i look at scanlan and i say go get her and i grab scanlan by the back and i throw him up  onto the wall  matt all right  marisha cheerleader boost  matt thats easy enough for a tenfoot wall oh and for /none/ a gnome so with that scanlan leaps up  and you land next to pike  sam hi baby its been so long man you look good aw man im so distracted by your beauty  hey lets kick some ass together shall we  ashley kick some ass come on lets go  matt and with that both scanlan and pike what do you guys want to do  sam ladies first  ashley can i jump off of the wall  matt you can  laura into the group  matt you can yeah  ashley yeah i /none/ can okay i want to try i want to see what happens if i cast turn undead  matt or destroy undead you have access to both  ashley oh man okay  matt its a 30foot radius  ashley lets do it i want to see it i want to see what it does  matt all right so i need you to go ahead and make an athletics check to see how far you can  jump if you dont mind  ashley what check was it  matt laura and travis athletics  marisha this is going /none/ to be so badass so badass  laura dont jinx it dont jinx it  ashley what do i roll again  matt rolling athletics  laura a 20 and then add your athletics  ashley i rolled a seven  matt laughs and whats your athletics  liam can i pick her up by the armor and throw her  matt laughs its a little late for that unfortunately whats your total  ashley okay hold on  matt okay just get in the swing of it first  ashley im so sorry you guys i roll a 20 /none/ and i rolled a ten i rolled a ten hold on  matt its all good  ashley natural 20  laura oh  sam hey what is she rolling huh  marisha she accidentally rolled a d10 so she was rerolling for a d20  and she rolled a natural 20  matt thats pretty fantastic  taliesin thank you for the translation  marisha yes oh yay  matt okay then given that circumstance you in this sunny radiant form you reach back and leap  into the air and for a split second you see with a /none/ flash of light almost like these momentary  feather angel wings burst out of the shoulders of pike that whoosh flap once and then disperse  into sparkling feathers that vanish under the rain as pike leaps out landing 35 feet in the  center of this on top of a skeleton you slide down its body as its shield pushes you off to the  ground and you land on your feet and as far as you can tell from your eyeline all you see are  chattering skulls and blades around you for all visual perspectives and a /none/ little bit of the  skyline above you a little bit of the clouded night sky so pike are you going to use your  action to destroy undead  ashley yeah  laughter  matt okay wow  marisha come on pike  laura oh my gosh  matt whats your spell dc be on your spell page  ashley it is 16  matt 16 good to know thats wisdom theyre minus one wisdom  marisha theres like 80 skeletons he has to roll for  laura yeah hes rolling a gajillion times ashley  taliesin roll  /none/ laura oh goodness  ashley i just keep hearing a thud  laura yeah  marisha yeah laughs  ashley thunk  liam its going to be like a knife through butter  laura i cant believe hes rolling this many times  marisha i know  laughter  matt okay so as you see all the skeletons begin to reach for you and their blades come pulling  down towards your armor you curl into a ball clutch your holy symbol of sarenrae and through  the connection that has allowed you to be here in this moment you /town/ feel this welling of radiant  energy just burst out from you in this shock wave of glowing radiant force just explosion noise  blast outward for that entire blast wave radius which would be the entirety of this road leading  back for about 60 feet you end up turning to ash roughly 36 of these skeletons  all whoa  ashley what  laughter  matt just explosion noise the rain itself is disintegrated by the sudden wave of heat and  there is just a cloud of ash that turns to mud immediately against the rain and /town/ slams against the  nearby buildings slowly dripping down the sides pieces of metal armor just go slamming to the  ground rolling clanking into piles and piles of currently unused weapons  laura our jaws are just  liam yeah  matt as you look up you can see the remainder of the horde which youre looking at probably about  at this point 20 or so skeletons still pushing forward at this point just mindlessly rushing  towards the closest thing they can see which is this glowing beacon of a gnome in the center of  the /town/ street  laura oh my god  matt all right so scanlan what do you want to do  sam by the way can i just say thats my girlfriend who just did that  laughter  sam i have to go to her aid how close are the skeletons that are approaching her right now  matt theyre going to be acting after this so theyre about 30 feet away from her so just  outside of the radius of her spell  sam okay im going to she jumped 35 feet out there  matt she did yes /none/  sam can i do that  matt if you want to try  marisha she rolled a natural 20  laura she rolled a natural 20  sam jesus that was hot  ashley i cant believe i rolled a natural 20 on my first roll  laura that is amazing  ashley so happy you guys  sam man  ashley it wont happen for the rest of the game  sam yeah im going to try to jump to her  laughter  matt okay  ashley do it do it  sam got to limber up /none/ first stretch out the calves  taliesin this is going to go so poorly  liam natural 20 for love  sam for love yeah four  laughter  sam is this acrobatics or athletics  matt its athletics  sam ooh thats a nine  matt the wall itself is slick and as you push down you lose your traction on the front it  doesnt cause you to fall per se but you manage to get ten feet off the actual wall landing  boof with a thud in the dirt and pike still 25 feet away from /none/ you  sam okay do i still have a move or is that my move  matt im going to say thats going to be your move  sam okay shit laughs how many are in my line of sight  matt the 20 or so that are left are currently 55 feet from you and beyond  sam and are they clumped together by any chance  matt they are theyre very clumped together  sam oh great  matt all their friends just turned to ash and theyre now starting to climb over the armor to  find /none/ their way towards pike  sam okay then im going to cast lightning bolt on them will i hit pike  is she in my line of fire  matt not if you angle it towards the edge  sam i will angle it then  laughter  matt all right  sam oh and also lightning bolt comes out of my body  matt out of your body in a straight line  sam can it come from my cock region  matt if you would like to  sam i would like it to just spew forth out /none/ of my gonads just at them  laura of course you do  sam im trying to impress pike ive got a lightning dick  matt an arcane display of virility if ever there was one scanlan does a singular classic ancient  technique the arcane thrust and with such boosh a bolt of energy goes firing out just  barely arcing around pikes form and slamming into a row of skeletons go ahead and roll your 8d6  and whats the dc on your spell i will say because youre doing the thrust you do not get  the /none/ cone on this one  sam oh well its not a its 17  matt 17  laura laughs he just put the cone down in a lower place  liam theres no 1d6 for cube damage  laughter  matt not for skeletons  sam counts quietly no wait thats 14 16 20 22  matt 22 all right so the bolt electric spark arcs through and slams into seven of them what  was the total damage there you said  sam im sorry  matt the total damage was  sam 22  matt 22 okay yeah /none/ so two of them survive you can see their kind of burnt charred forms and  one of thems missing an arm now and the armor itself is still electricity noise arcing little  bits of energy five of them however just explode into black burning bone chips  laura bone chips  matt at which point you can now see bolts of lightning are lightning strike coming down from  the storm in the distance too as the thunderstorm itself is reaching more of a fervored  pace the rain itself getting harder and harder on you guys so /none/ with that you can see looking over  your shoulder on the other side of this wall another bit of skeletal horde is starting to come  down one of the nearby intersections and its starting to come around  the other side of you guys  laura oh were getting trapped  travis oh shock we should have fucking run  matt you do see however that the ten villagers and keeper yennan are currently rushing towards  that group to hold them at bay and keeper looks back over his shoulder and says you dont  worry weve /none/ got this you do what you must it has begun finish it and goes charging forward  holding his shield forward rushing towards the group of skeletons the skeletons however you  have to do something at this point  liam im going to hold my turn  matt hold your turn okay the remaining 13 or so skeletons use their full movement to get up only  three of which can actually get into combat range with pike since their speed is only 30 that  radius really messed them up man  ashley yeah  matt glad you /none/ could make it tonight  laughter  liam are they closing in on pike  matt they are yes  liam oh then im going to leap off the wall and run towards pike  matt okay so youll get there simultaneously youll be doing your action simultaneously so  you run off the wall running steps and make it up not a problem at all with speed pike as you  see the rest of the skeletons zoning in on you vax suddenly just rushes to your side daggers at  the ready three skeletons are going to take /none/ swipes at pike that is a 17 nope oh its a  seven oh skeletons and that is a 12 yeah two of them try and swipe and you just knock it  out of the way with your shield a third one does hit you in the front of the chest but the armor  deflects it entirely and the blade actually sinks a little bit into your form but the radiant  energy that holds your position there just pushes it off and the blade itself seems to almost dull  from the impact  taliesin up yours /none/ harryhausen  matt youre up  liam how many skeletons are in range right now  matt well the final seven that are currently there are within range if you wish to attack any  of them there are three that are currently in melee with her  liam im going to take my blades and spin around pommel out and im going to start punching i  have no idea if this will do anything there is a symbol of sarenrae sewn into this glove right  here im just going to start i dont have the boots of /none/ haste on so i can  just take two swings at  sam punching  liam yeah two skeletons one skeleton whatever skeleton is closest to pike  matt theres a skeleton right next to both you and pike  liam yeah all right hes getting it in the dusty jaw  matt go for it  liam all right i have no idea how to do this ive never done anything without a dagger thats  not good i dont know what to add to this  laura you still get sneak attack if youre in back of them /none/  liam thats true but i have to hit  laughter  matt so if youre just physically punching this is strengthbased so roll a d20 add your  strength modifier and your proficiency although its unarmed strike so i dont know if youre  proficient with unarmed strikes  liam no thats fine so the first one misses entirely  matt okay  liam and the second one is oh this is probably fine for skeletons 12 13 14  matt what did you roll on the dice  liam 11  matt yeah you hit  liam okay /none/ thats the right hand with the symbol  matt the symbol of sarenrae okay go ahead and roll 1d2 plus your strength modifier damage  laura 1d2 theres no 1d2  matt roll a d4 and divide it by two  liam its a one so its a one  matt whats your modifier for strength  liam two so its a three  matt so you do three points of vax fist damage right to the skull crushing sound  sam she killed 36 of them  matt it hurts at impact and you feel like the bone wobbled /none/ as the skull bone ratchety noise  back towards you  liam this symbol does nothing for me im here to soak up damage for you pike let them hit me in  the face  taliesin it looks great  marisha good craftsmanship  matt but well done that was a fun round  liam that was a test its better now than against sylas briarwood  matt laughs true enough  travis can i make it around the wall  matt if you want to make an athletics check to leap up and use that to jump off /none/ you mister  athletic movement and high speed  travis 19  matt rolled a 19  travis 12 and seven  matt ill say you leap up on the wall use that as kind of a stepping point and jump as far as  you can you get 20 feet forward beyond the wall heavy landing land with your hammer to your  side flames ignite flames flickering off the edge of it you still have id give you 20 more  feet of movement at this point because youre a crazyfast barbarian  travis can i reach them /none/  matt youd be able to reach two of them right on the other side of pike  travis tee time and i rush up with the war hammer and swing  matt okay go for it  marisha tea time  laura tee time i was picturing tea he probably meant golf  travis like happy gilmore  taliesin fist full of crumpets  travis tea time thats a 26  matt 26 that definitely hits roll for damage on the first one  travis okay i dont know  taliesin mister cobblemitts i do declare  sam get /none/ your doilies out  travis okay 11 12  matt 12 damage how much is the war hammer of that not the fire damage  travis oh just 11  matt 11 okay as you smack into it you can see the bones themselves are brittle by nature but the  solid slamming force of a thick piece of honed metal into the side of this bonebrittle creature  just sends it shattering to the side you get the feeling that these entities are particularly  fragile against bludgeoning weapons so your first strike just scatters one of the skeletons /none/ across  the ground you have one more in your reach if you want to go for your second attack  travis yeah  matt okay  travis 20  matt 20 go ahead and roll damage on that one  travis laughs 16 22  matt explosion noise the second one just explodes up into the air you can see one of its  shields goes flying off and lands on one of the roofs almost like walter whites pizza  marisha i dodge a femur  ashley i give grog an airhighfive  matt as great weapon master /none/ i believe if you kill something you also can use a bonus action to  get a third attack outside of your frenzied rage so i mean nothings in right now in melee range  for you but if you wanted to throw your hammer you could  travis im also not raging  matt correct im saying as part of great weapon master you can not rage kill something and then  get a free attack with your weapon  travis well lets throw some shit then  matt laughs so with the chain of returning attached to your /dung/ hammer you go ahead and  propeller noise send it swinging towards one of the further skeletons  travis 25  matt 25 definitely hits go ahead and roll damage  travis ten 14  matt 14 doubled due to the bludgeoning vulnerability on the initial impact the hammer  slams into its rib cage causing it to cave inward its entire upper body just falls into  itself as the hammer not meeting any resistance goes beyond and impact splotches into the mud  go ahead and make your athletics check to try and pull the hammer back  /none/ liam like youre attacking ribbon candy  matt kind of technically  travis 13  matt 13 you just sucking noise pull it out with a sickening sound thunk catch it in the  air the blood dripping the mud dripping off of it but you see it burning away as the flames  begin to burst through the actual mud  laura youre licking the mud off  travis yeah never know a place until you lick the mud  matt burns some of the taste buds as the searing hot edge of of the hammer reaches your tongue /none/  travis pained noises  matt all right that ends that round there are now currently four skeletons on this side well  say for the sake of brevity you manage to in the next round or so just destroy them the flaming  sphere itself can just bash through them so youre on two sides of the wall the rains  pouring so heavily lightning crash theres a flash in the distance of lightning i want  everyone to roll perception  travis now i know what were looking for  taliesin have to have a conversation soon  /town/ marisha have to have a conversation oh fuck  sam 16  travis two  liam 20  taliesin 17  laura 19  marisha one  matt so you got 20 you see in the flash of lightning in the distance you can see just barely  on the other side of the town square what looks like the outline of a giant currently slamming  into something and out of the corner of your eye you see a second one to the south side of the  city there are still a few of these giant sentinels out /none/ there they dont look too terribly  close but theyre still on the rampage  laura should get out of here  sam or kill them  travis or kill them  laura thats a lot of giants to take on  sam theres two  liam we need to go kill those giants right now we have a holy gnome right now i dont know how  you came to us pike we need to go to them and then we need to go to the briarwoods now now  laura im out of spells we cant go to /none/ the briarwoods now i am out of spells  liam granted were going to the giants now  marisha i dont think we have a choice  liam giants now  sam giants lets go get the giants  taliesin yennan can you hold until morning  matt as youre shouting this over he is currently about 40 feet away right now slamming  into a front line of skeletons grabbing his own holy symbol and you see another similar burst of  energy to the one that pike let out earlier explosion that same dull bassy impact sound  /none/ you feel a shudder in the ground beneath you as a series of more skeletons are immediately  disintegrated in his proximity looks over his shoulder until morning why wait until morning  were fighting now  taliesin well do what we can  sam hold that thought  travis ill go  liam giants now  sam giants yes  laura i can shoot an arrow  liam better than the briarwoods plus giants lets go get those giants right now  sam are the two giants together or are they coming from opposite sides  liam no theres /none/ one over there and theres one off in that direction  matt one to the east one to the south  sam lets split the party  marisha split the party i say we do it fuck it lets split the party  one take east one take west  liam all right weight it more heavily to the group that does not have pike  laura yeah  matt okay whos taking whom  sam oh im with pike  laughter  marisha spellcasters should split up ill go without what did you just say  laura i said /none/ percy you me and vax go on one and then these three go on another  all yes  travis ill take the gnomes on my shoulders  laughter  liam ah its adorable  taliesin give you a big hug  matt all right so we have grog and the two gnomes and the rest of you  marisha hey we started something we cant stop  matt whos going which direction  travis grog and the two gnomes will run south  liam are they to the south and west  matt currently to the south and east /none/  laura why are we splitting this is the stupidest  sam everything weve done in this fight is the stupidest lets go  marisha lets go  sam all right big and smalls are going south  taliesin we meet to the west  marisha well go east  taliesin were going east but we meet to the west when were finished  travis the treeline  taliesin listen to your ears  marisha although remember the signals a little weak  taliesin once we get back to the western wall well be able to hear each other  /none/ matt all right  taliesin oh god  matt grog and gnomes you guys are going to the south all right as you guys dart off making  your way around the still very ominous and creepy sun tree to your left you can see all the various  muddy prints of all the scraping skeletons that came through here and in the distance you can  still hear echoing shouts combat shouts commands being sent throughout theres still very much an  aggressive presence of the resistance in this city you have no idea whether or not its on /none/ the  winning or losing side at this moment but it is still active you guys divide at this point  starting with you guys grog holding both the gnomes and you can feel pike is lighter than  normal and you know her weight quite well as youre used to putting her up on your shoulders  from growing up with her and in recent years but theres also this strange kind of vibration to her  body like its not physically there but yet it does feel like there is physical presence  as youre rushing through the /town/ rain acknowledging this you make your way to the bottom of the  square charging through you almost slip at one point and catch yourself head past one street a  second street and to the left as you glance off you can see there is another patch of skeletons  and currently about five villagers that are just trying to tear through them you see a couple of  bodies of villagers that have recently been killed theres one thats actually still  partially alive on the ground its like dragging itself through the mud in your direction like /none/  gasping grunting rain pouring down theres a big trail of mud and blood currently behind him as  hes making his way towards you guys gasp help what are you doing grog  travis pike do you want to help him  ashley what did you say it was  liam theres a person wounded pulling themselves through the mud saying help me  ashley yeah i do i always want to help somebody i dont know what do you think  sam yeah lets do it lets help him  ashley okay  travis all right we stop /none/ and let pike down  matt okay so you rush up to this guy as you get up to him you see his face is halfcovered in  blood his side is very heavily wounded it looks like he took some sort of a spear wound that then  tore through his midsection he has been bleeding out pretty heavily at this point and probably  doesnt have much longer to him as you bring pike down below him pike what are you going to do  ashley okay ill cure wounds  matt what level  ashley ill do /none/ 3rd  matt okay so go ahead and roll for that  sam shes the best  laughter  sam look at her grog shes helping an innocent bystander she didnt have to  travis going to step on his throat after shes done  sam she just is a people person  matt all right 3d8 plus five  ashley garbled 23  travis 23  matt 23 okay so as you reach forward he looks up at you like hes seeing an angel walk towards  him and looks scared hes like no not yet not yet and /none/ as you reach forward and touch the sides  of his face with your smile of mercy and understanding your warm hands touch the sides of  his head and the energy of sarenraes blessing pours through his body you can see the insides of  his armor begin to give this soft glow from where the wounds are as they close up you can see the  large gash in his side begin to stitch itself up magically and at that point he takes a deep  breath for a second and kind of turns over and is now /none/ in sitting position breathing heavily  looking around himself confused you youre an angel a bloody right angel  ashley no im not i  matt he reaches out for you with his hand forward thank you  ashley i help him up  matt he gets up and he still seems sore and bruised and theres still wounds across his body  but hes no longer on the path to terminal loss of his life he stands up okay okay thank you  travis run now  matt oh i intend to and he reaches over in the mud /none/ and finds his sword wipes it off from the  side war cry turns around and rushes back in to the rest of his allies  travis i like him  sam hes a good guy  travis i pick pike back up put her on my shoulder and we keep running  matt okay you guys go charging back into the storm from the south side  skype sound  all oh no  matt weve lost pike  laura oh no  sam its okay its okay  liam keep telling the story  marisha oh god  /dung/ matt technology as you guys continue running forward you go past two city streets the whole  citys dark now its closed down in preparation for what this evening is going to  entail so you go past these two streets to the left immediately you hear the familiar sound of  a large heavy mass slamming into the ground and as soon as you turn the corner you can see there  are three people left in this one resistance brigade there is a pile of wounded andor killed  soldiers around its feet and it looks like its /none/ been nearly untouched this one apparently got the  drop on them or at least they werent fully prepared for what they were up against and its  just swinging this giant club in the air around towards them theyre all kind of keeping their  distance not knowing if they should run or keep fighting as you just turn around the corner i  want you guys to roll initiative  sam initiative ashley initiative  ashley okay wait i cut out right when you said was that guy bad  sam no he was a good guy you /none/ did good kid  ashley okay  marisha he picked up a sword and went running back into battle  liam back to the fight  ashley okay good  travis boss  sam 16 for me  travis yes me too  matt fantastic  sam well go last  liam ooh hes got houses  laura oh wow this one is very very rolly what did you get for initiative ashley  ashley i got a six  laura aw  sam she said six  laura yeah  sam aw  matt should be fine there  /none/ marisha fine fuck it  liam oh look at that  laura whoa hes huge grog is almost as big as him almost  marisha you ready for this grog  matt she is turned this way right now theyre all keeping their distance at this point all  right so initiatives for that oh all right  liam blood of the giant you can do this  marisha oh man im so excited  laura horrified  marisha yeah me too a little horrified  matt all right so initiatives are  sam and travis 16  sam six /none/ for her  matt all righty  marisha does trinket wheres trinket  laura im riding trinket  marisha oh were riding trinket  laura im riding trinket  marisha youre riding trinket okay  matt all right grog and scanlan you guys are up first  sam ill go first im not going to do much but i will take out my wand of magic missiles because  ive got to use everything i got and i will shoot fuck it six missiles ill use six of the  slots so its three plus another five  matt okay /none/ and how many total do you have on there  sam every day it recharges and i rolled and its back up to seven  matt okay got you so seven is the max you can hold for that okay so youre using the last of  yours for this this is the last  sam i am using six of the seven  matt okay got you okay got you then go ahead and roll for that  travis put the stank on this guy  sam what do i do 11 i dont what am i adding to /none/ this  matt well for magic missile you keep firing  marisha it just happens  matt yeah you dont have to roll they all hit automatically thats the good thing about magic  missile it just hits all right so you create three darts so its 3d4 plus three and then if  youre casting it at 6thlevel you said  sam yeah  matt all right thatll be an additional five darts 8d4 plus eight  sam okay three five eight 12 14 15 17 17 plus eight 25  matt 25 points of damage to the giant /none/ as you jump off grogs shoulder pull out your wand it  all of a sudden glows for a second and from that point like a swarming anime missile storm these  unerringly hitting arcane missiles slamming into the sides of the giant growls you can see bits  of its flesh unfolding and spilling off to the side exposing some bone underneath as all of a  sudden its attention shifts looking over its shoulder at the three of you as it begins to  right itself preparing being flanked on each side a little bit of undead intelligence /town/ within  its brain knowing how to defend itself growls  sam as my movement im going to where am i  matt youre right here on the side of grog  sam im going to move just in that thing wheres the laser  taliesin oh the thingie  sam i dont know im going to move to my left into that little alcove there  matt okay so youre kind of hiding around the wall of the one of the buildings and as you dart  to the side kind of glancing around the corner  sam and /none/ ill sing a song of inspiration for grog  matt all righty  sam sings well now whitestones got problems and now we really cant solve them unless we make  really deep cuts so baby show me that grog blood  laughter  matt take your d10 inspiration  travis wow  matt grog youre up hearing this beat in the back of your head as scanlans  stomping his foot  travis this is my jam  laughter  travis i go into a frenzied rage and i rush the stone giant from behind  and i take /none/ aim at his right  matt you guys are almost in the same position there  travis at his right leg yeah  matt oh youre spooning  travis i aim at the back of his right knee  matt go for it  travis 17  matt that hits  travis should i roll damage first or all three  matt theres no other current combat target so you can roll all three its fine  travis 26  matt hits  travis 24 sorry and 19  matt hits hes very slowmoving and a very large target hes /none/ very easy to hit thankfully so as  you rush up first what you got  travis 22 for the first one  matt 22 nice  travis 13 for the second one  matt nice  travis 15 for the third one  matt nice whack you slam the hammer into the side of one of its calves it buckles for a second  and you can see the muscle itself kind of snap and a piece of bone is now jutting out of the side of  its leg  travis singing now we got grogs blood  /none/ laughter  matt with that you swing the hammer around and slam it into the bone actually jamming it deeper  into its leg  all yell  travis yes yes  matt as you pull back these slow flames kind of burning the outside you can see the flesh  sizzling with the impact of the burning hammer swing it once in your hand whack onto the other  side this time the actual leg bursts out that side and it falls almost a little bit its sort  of walking on this stump of a leg now you /none/ pretty much destroyed the bottom half of its middle of  its calf to its foot its just slumping over the toes still kind of wiggling on its own its now  half on part of its leg as at this point it kind of rotates in place towards you now using one  hand to get around as it brings this club up looking up into its face now as you havent  really had a closeup on this its strange to see you see there are similar features youve  encountered stone giants this up close and this /none/ personal there is where your brethren your blood  comes from however half of its face is torn off by some sort of large claw mark where there would  be an eye is just this sunken socket and there are these streaks of dried blood that long before the  rainstorm came are just smeared across the face and part of its jaw is broken open and you can see  jagged broken teeth underneath its tongue lolls out the side and it just undead groan reaches up with  its club to come on down laughs all right /none/ so the first its going to come down and strike you  with this giant clublike piece of heavy wood and metal thats a natural 20  laura his face as he said it  matt thats an 18 plus nine so its  travis 27 halved  matt well no thats to hit  travis oh the hit got you  matt all right so first strike comes at you for 16 points of bludgeoning damage halved to eight  the other one comes to you at 14 points of bludgeoning damage halved to seven it looks  very /none/ very angry and very frustrated with the current circumstance but you take each blow to  the chest showing off that strength you normally would do to something of your kin and ilk even  though its not really living old habits are hard to break finishing its turn three resistance  members rush into its side as its now turned to face you with its broken leg rushing in strike  it hits hits hits all have short swords out and theyre just stabbing it in the side of its  body now that they have this opening and /none/ this distraction in the current moment five five  five which is 21 points of slashing damage  travis damn  matt from all three of them just stabbing it with a blade in the side that ends its turn bringing  it to the top pike youre up  laura go pike  ashley wait i rolled a six  matt yeah now its your turn  ashley its already my turn  matt yep everyone else went its your turn  ashley okay so im going to guiding bolt  matt okay  ashley that guy or wait /none/ is anybody where are you at  sam hes right there but go ahead go ahead pike  ashley all right  sam light him up  matt you got this  liam friendly fire just turns grog on  travis yeah im just getting a warmup right now  matt so go ahead and make a ranged spell attack roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier  sam most of his damage comes from behind  ashley 17  matt okay are you casting it at 1st level or a higher level  ashley ill cast it /none/ at a four  matt okay all right and whatd you roll  travis 17  matt 17 definitely hits so go ahead and roll 7d6 radiant damage  marisha what  sam wait what  laura how did we not have pike with us this whole time  matt 7d6 radiant damage  travis vaporize this motherfucker laughs cross the streams  laughter  sam oh no grog that means youre going to get that much damage  travis but im a good person  marisha yeah its radiant it should do more against him  matt actually this /none/ is a singletarget spell theres no radius to this  marisha single attack all right  matt whats your total damage  ashley 24  matt 24 points of radiant damage  ashley yes  matt okay so as you stand there for a second you pull your holy symbol up kind of putting your  shield to the side and as you release your hand out in front of you this beam of divine energy  streaks out slamming into the zombie giant as it hits it continues to burn like a stream into its  body searing the /none/ flesh in a path as it does as it impacts it leaves this glowing pulsing divine  symbol across its chest of sarenrae the next attack against it has advantage  sam from pike or from everybody  matt no the next person to attack it gets advantage  travis did i take any damage  matt no no she was very precise with her impact on the giant all right do you want to move on  your turn at all pike stay where you are or do you want to move close to it  ashley where am /none/ i sorry  laura oh can you not see youre far away  ashley i cant see very well ill stay  matt okay youll stay where you are okay you keep your distance from it let grog do his thing  okay that brings us to the top of the round grog scanlan you guys are up again  travis would you like to go  sam next attack has advantage i defer to you ill hold my roll  travis sweet if hes starting to lean down i want to take his head and turn it  into /none/ a teeball target  matt laughs okay  marisha dont forget about your weapon master thing

/dung/ travis 15 so 25  matt 25 all righty  liam can these actors do addition  marisha i know laughs  travis 18 23 33  matt 33 points of damage  marisha holy shit nice  matt all right so as you swing the hammer upward whack it hits along the side of its  skull and you can see its skull actually cave in and crack a bit bone and flesh  scraped away where it cracks you can see a bit of black brain mass begin to leak through using  that you spin the hammer /none/ around and hit it again the same place whack finding the weak point  this time just the anger to smash through impact sound it caves inward and you can see  bits of bone jam into its one semifunctioning eye its head now loosely pushed in on one side  the jaw hangs a little bit loose the third strike you come down whack hit it from the  other side the jaw dislodges and goes flying off  travis dibs  laughter  matt but its still standing  laura without a head  matt his heads still /none/ there his jaw is dislodged the lower half of his jaw is missing  its just this open part his tongue dangling loosely out of the bottom part of its head caved  inward just deep zombie groan  travis shove my hand up your skull and work you like a sock puppet  laughter  matt are you going to stay where you are grog  travis yeah  matt all right scanlan youre up  sam how far can i move  matt you can move 25 feet so five squares  sam 25 thats it  matt /none/ youre a little gnome dude you have little legs  sam can i get next to grog can i get near grog can i get at an angle where i wont hit grog with  lightning  matt you can but at pretty much every angle youre going to hit somebody  aside from the giant  sam oh i dont care about those guys  laughter  sam i guess i should pikes with me ive got to do this right damn it groans if only you  werent here pike pike dont look  matt what are you /none/ doing  liam you shoot it at an angle up at his head up into the sky  sam all right i will try to hit him with a lightning bolt but miss as many people as  possible  matt hes tall hes down a little bit because of the impact that grog gave but at a higher angle  you could probably hit him without hitting the other guy  sam okay i will angle up this time i would like the lightning to come from my ass  matt youre william wallaceing it  sam yes and /none/ ill just lightning him at normal lightning damage  matt all right so 8d6 damage does not make its saving throw with a three  laura how can you even aim like that scanlan  sam oh i have practiced aiming things with my ass in this campaign  matt very true sadly  sam counts quietly 28  matt 28 points of damage all right lightning crash the bolt of lightning shoots off into the  sky arcing through its body you can see where part of its neck muscle was torn it fuses into  its shoulder from /none/ the impact of the bolt moans almost falls over from the blast however it  catches itself and grunts gets right back up its looking pretty rough but its still keeping  itself there yeah  sam what i just farted lightning on him  matt that ends your turn  sam ill inspire pike ill turn to her and ill say sings i wish they all could be cleric  gnomian girls  laughter  matt all right pike you get a d10 inspiration dice from scanlan a voice youve longed to hear  for some time as your /none/ friendship has been so far away take your 1d10  laura hear that scanlan friendship  sam friendship aw man  matt all right so on the zombie giants turn it recovers from the bolt of lightning looking at  this large target in front of it it sees this tiny little morsel and you see it brings up its  leg thats partially destroyed and heavy footsteps begins to move forward just to there  to get you within range its going to move a little closer it gets two attacks of opportunity  from the guards behind it /none/  sam two  taliesin i was about to say the guard is there  laura against it against it  matt that somehow actually misses with a two that does hit though so it takes oh nice  eight points of slashing damage from one of the guards that as it runs by just swings out and  slashes across its thigh as it comes up towards you it zombie groan its tongue dangling out  this horrible gurgling sound coming out of what is now technically its open throat as it brings its  club upward  sam /none/ as my reaction i bring up my shawm its a horn and i blow the note the note is like dumb  and dumber the sound he makes offkey horn noise that most annoying sound offkey horn  noise and mash all my fingers down  matt okay is this your  sam this is my trying to cutting words  matt cutting words okay all right well it rolled a 21 to hit for cutting words you roll a  d10 and subtract that from the attack roll right  sam what is this  taliesin and marisha that /none/ is a ten  marisha big money no whammies  sam one  marisha fuck  laughter  matt so 20 does that hit  sam that hits  matt all right so offkey horn noise ping  laughter  matt laughing horrible shrieking sound  sam oh my shawm  matt you take 20 points of bludgeoning damage from the first strike and your shawm is bent and  weak horn noise not quite youll probably have to buy a new one or get that repaired you almost  lost a tooth in the process as youre like groans /none/ from the impact you pull back and you  can feel already the pulsing of the blood from the veins that have burst it brings up its club  one more time roars  sam oh god  matt that is going to be a 13  sam that misses  laughter  matt this time as it brings its club up you see the arc and you  sam im ducking down to work on the shawm  laughter  matt whoosh the swing is completely out of your view  laughter  matt all right that ends its /none/ turn the guards are going to rush forward now they technically  have advantage on it because theyre flanking with you a two and a three guys youre killing me  four and a six the six actually still hits six and a 20 there we go and a critical so miss and  then a hit and a critical  travis nice natural 20  matt so thats seven points of slashing damage from the first one and then the critical ooh  nice and a six on that one so thats 12 14 points of slashing damage from /none/ the other guy so  both of the guards rush up one of them misses entirely one jams the blade to the hilt in the  middle of its body and pulls out the last one actually jumps up onto its back and takes the  sword and slams it into its spine and drags it down a really decent wound for anything not this  big on this size its a little gash still but it left a nice sizable wound and it opens up and  this horrible smell comes reeking out the guy almost vomits as he /none/ backs up just groans the  rot escaping from the wound that ends their turn pike youre up  travis put some hurt on this undead bastard  ashley okay where are you at scanlan  sam you mean physically or mentally because im in love with you  laughter  sam but im right next to grog grog and i are right in front of the giant  ashley healthwise where are you at  sam oh im fine dont worry about me baby  ashley okay so im going to go up to the giant where the open /none/ wound is where that guy just broke  it open i have sprinters boots if i cant get all the way up to it  matt yeah youll have to use those to get up to him  ashley okay ill use sprinters boots  matt all right  ashley im going to use my mace and im going to start ripping where that wound is  matt actually the open wound would be around here but with sprinters boots you can get there  just fine yeah so you actually get around all right and youre technically flanking with /none/ grog  so you have advantage on these attacks  marisha nice  matt so go for it  ashley okay so i roll  matt roll to attack twice and take the higher of the two i know youve been filming for a while  ashley roll the d20 twice  liam roll two times take the higher of the two  ashley 17  matt okay thats the higher of the two  ashley thats the higher of the two i had a seven and a 17  matt yeah that definitely hits roll for the second attack /none/ because you can use your bonus  action to strike because youre a war cleric  ashley nine  matt a total of nine  laura did you add it to anything  ashley wait am i supposed to add something  matt add your attack bonus next to your weapon on your character sheet  ashley shit sorry guys  matt its okay youre out of practice girl its all good youve been too busy being in  someones blindspot  laura youre busy being in the lab  ashley oh 17 again  matt 17 again there you /none/ go both hit go ahead and roll the damage for the mace plus  if i recall  ashley i think its 1d6 plus three plus seven if its an attack hit  matt 1d6 plus three yep you also have a mace of disruption dont you  liam disruption i think so yeah  matt what was the effect on that one do you have the item with you  ashley i do shit no i dont have the papers  sam stolen on the subway on the way home from work  ashley guys someone took it from /none/ me  matt you also add an additional 1d8 damage to the first strike  liam 2d6 radiant damage dc 15 wisdom save  matt its not going to make that it didnt make that  laughter  liam its now frightened of pike until the end of her next turn  sam ooh  matt awesome all right so youre rolling 1d6 plus three plus another 1d8 and how much did you  say for that  liam 2d6 radiant damage  matt okay so 3d6 plus three and then an additional 1d8 for each strike  sam wait /none/ what  ashley wait so one more time  sam why is she so goddamn powerful  matt undead man  liam cleric vs undead  ashley you said 3d6  matt 3d6 plus three plus an additional 1d8 radiant damage  marisha for every roll  matt for both attacks yeah  marisha for both attacks  laura per attack  ashley fuck  laura this is the best  ashley okay  matt undead  liam we needed her from the getgo  sam matt while shes rolling can you describe her hair at this moment is it /none/ whipping around is  it in her face is it covering her eyes in a sexy sweaty way  taliesin matted with jam  sam hes ignoring me  ashley can i use my d10 an additional d10 from scanlan for the inspiration  matt not for damage that was just to hit  ashley im getting carried away okay 23  matt 23 on the first hit  ashley oh shit i forgot the second hit  matt yeah  ashley sorry  marisha 23 on the first hit  ashley sorry guys watching sorry  liam bring the /none/ holy retribution  marisha theyll understand  laura oh ive missed pike so much  marisha me too  ashley oh ive missed you too  marisha i like your headphones too by the way  liam kill kill kill  ashley 21  laura yay  liam all right 44  matt all right the mace of disruption actually has a different effect its not about a  frightened thing if it has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage it has to make a dc 15  wisdom saving throw which it fails  sam which /none/ means  matt so as you rush up along the side of it your sprinters boots carrying you this blur of  divine gnomish energy you see through her somewhat shimmering radiant form the hair itself  glistens against the rain it almost doesnt even touch somehow immaculate in the middle of combat  you find it slow motion in your head and for that brief moment you remember how much it hurt to see  her go and how happy you are to have her here however you in the middle of your battle trance  pike rush up /none/ shield ahead you take the mace and seeing the open wound slam the mace in there  once wham as you hit the actual undead flesh burns away from the impact leaving this ashy  swath of missing flesh in its body the creature gives out this weird gurgly bellow roar using  that moment as it rears back how do you want to do this  cheering  marisha shes gone she ran away she took her headphones off and did a lap  ashley okay im back oh my gosh  matt the magical power of this is /none/ essentially destroying the creature so describe this however  you want to in your radiant cleric form  ashley okay i want him to just explode with a radiant glow  matt okay as he reaches back you see this foothold on its knee as its trying to keep itself  aloft you leap up using your sprinters boots onto one of its knees jump in the air dropping  your shield and two hands on your mace you leap in the air slam it downward as the mace impacts  on the front of its chest theres this brief /none/ moment of pause as it cracks into its flesh its  head looks down at you and theres a burst of divine energy as his entire torso explosion rips  open what would be organs within that exposed however are all also turned to ash as the body  death rattle dissipates and disintegrates falling into a puddle of liquid messy muddy ash  and bits and pieces of remaining giant there as pike lands on the ground 3point landing mace in  one hand walks over and picks up her shield and looks over her shoulder at grog and /town/ scanlan  sam can i faint  matt yeah  laughter  sam oh  travis hes always doing that welcome back pike  ashley laughs oh boy what the heck  matt the three soldiers who are now there looking dumbfounded at this moment step forward  and you look like fighters except you have this glowing divine entity amongst the three of you  he steps forward if i might ask who are you and how did you do that  travis were the deliverers of this town go spread the word it all comes down tonight  /none/ matt youre with the de rolos  sam and laura quietly not tonight  travis tonight tomorrow tit for tat whatever  matt youre not there  laura he is hes there  sam im just waking up what whats going on  travis it goes down in the next  sam 24 hours  travis dont put a timeline on it these things it takes a little time  matt youre with the de rolos  travis aye with the de rolos  matt then let it be done thank you for the save were going to gather our /town/ wounded and  prepare for the next attack  sam prepare wait for our signal spread the word  matt all right men come and the three of them rush off they gather up a few of their  friends who are further down the road all groaning and wounded getting up and putting their  arms over their friends necks gathering the dead and pulling them off the middle of the road you  notice as theyre pulling them off the road each one of their dead friends theyre actually  pulling out torches and lighting fire to their /none/ corpses  travis yeah they dont want them to come back  sam should we loot should we loot them first laughs that would be in poor taste  matt so what are you guys doing  taliesin check the body for secrets  travis do we want to stay or do we want to head back towards the other three  sam we should start heading back we probably wont get there in time wait percy said to meet  in the west  travis thats right we should head to the west to the wall to the city /none/ wall  sam well head west to our appointed meeting spot  laura wild wild west  marisha vaguely west  sam as we go im looking at clotheslines for any sort of beret type of a hat  laughter  matt roll perception  travis can we roll hit dice at any time during the day  matt only during a short rest  travis got it  sam 13  matt 13 not in this weather not in this city  sam a yarmulke anything  matt nope whitestone not really a beret kind of people  sam /none/ im a little thing i have a little head maybe it could be just a shoulder pad  matt like a sock sure theres also no laundry left out during the middle of a rainstorm  sam all right fine  travis maybe theyre terribly irresponsible  matt it could be unfortunately at this moment no you are unable to see any sort of a beret or  couldbefashionedintoaberettype clothing piece  travis no dust of tracelessness this time as we head to the western wall  matt oh grogs getting bold  travis were getting bold  matt all /town/ right so as you guys go rushing towards the western side of the city to meet up with the  rest of the group the rest of you rushing past the center of the town square you go running  through the rain to the far side you can now see the form that you originally saw vax one of  these giants has been pushed back as you get all the way to the eastern side youre actually  outside the city now youre pushing into the forest on the outskirts on the raised hill  amongst this part /town/ of the town just outside the wall there is the temple of pelor in the center  of the large graveyard  you can see that this zombie giant has been pushed back you can just barely see the crest of him  currently slamming some sort of large metallic weapon around right over the treeline as you  approach the outside gate of the graveyard itself  liam im going stealth  laura i hunters mark him  matt okay whats the range on hunters mark  laura thats a good question it doesnt say  laura and travis /none/ 90 feet  matt 90 feet youre probably going to have to get a little bit closer  laura okay i hunters mark him as soon as i can  matt okay good to know you guys all going stealth right now or are you all rushing in  laura im just going to rush in  marisha yeah lets run im just running keyleths running  matt okay the gates are slammed open part of the metals bent inward like whatever was pushing  the giant back at this point had slammed through the gate  taliesin hey vax /none/  liam im gone man  taliesin oh youre gone  liam well i rolled a 23 am i stealthed  matt you feel pretty stealthy  taliesin you have an earring though if hes on his ass you have a  better chance of hitting him correct  liam yeah that sounds good  taliesin good to know  matt all right so as you guys all rush into the center here looking about you can see this  hefty graveyard that you visited about two days ago all of the graves are open all of them are  /none/ excavated and open and youre starting to see where theyre pulling a lot of these undead from  travis thats just rude  matt however many of them being armored and armed means it wasnt a direct transition they  were probably pulled from here and given weapons elsewhere but thats the first thought  that catches your attention as you rush in here  rain pouring down the clapping of thunder in the distance you can see there are six of these  soldiers that are currently hacking away at this one giant thats being pushed up towards the /none/ edge  of the temple right now it looks like its cornered but its lashing out like a wild animal  roll initiative folks  sam initiative initiative  marisha damn it its the second one ive rolled in a row  taliesin i am a monster i am a monster  laura ive got to retire this one for a while  travis you literally are a monster  taliesin i have really high initiative  laura did i already hunters mark him now  matt you can now yes  liam and matt as we ran i wanted /none/ to split off from the group and go up along the side  matt along the side this way okay so youll be over here  laura i leap off trinket as we get close  matt oh chuckles all right so 20 to 25 anybody 20 to 15  liam 19  taliesin oh im sorry 26  travis oh im sorry 26  laura im sorry i wasnt paying attention 26  sam oh i was reading a book sorry  travis come on shadow turd  taliesin this is going to be hilarious  liam thats what /none/ they call me  taliesin im going to do something ive never done before  matt that brings us to keyleth what did you get  laura oh no ten  marisha yeah im distracted  matt all right the image of this whole thing even though it looks like its currently  surrounded its giant form barely damaged at this point is still a very ominous thing that strikes  a bit of fear in your heart causing you to hold back on your initial assault and also worrying  about not knowing how the rest of your party /none/ is doing percy you start this off right now  taliesin pull out bad news  matt okay  taliesin im going to take aim and im going to wait for it to raise its club hand up its  holding a club  matt actually from this view you can see its actually a very large morningstar  taliesin its a very large morningstar drop that im going to have him drop the morningstar  aimed shot  matt all right  marisha come on percy roll hes got shitty ac  taliesin thankfully its got shitty ac 16 /none/  matt 16 does hit  taliesin drop it  matt all right so as you get down to the ground gunshot blast the echoing explosive shot fired  from the bad news slams up as it lifts its morningstar in the air two of its fingers get blown  off its hand and the morningstar tumbles boof onto the ground nearly crushing one of the guards  nearby who barely manages to sidestep as it boof boof lands on its side right outside the  temple of pelor well done  taliesin next shot im taking a sharpshooter shot /none/ im reloading  matt yep reload with your second attack  taliesin taking a sharpshooter shot  matt all right  taliesin 15  matt 15 hits  taliesin and this is also an aimed shot sorry i spent another grit so sorry for not saying that  ill do my damage and then tell you it was an aimed shot to the legs so thats oh my god 16  26 32 points of damage and it needs to make a constitution saving throw  matt okay whats the dc on it  taliesin oh my god this is /none/ insane dc equals eight plus your proficiency modifier plus your  dexterity modifier  matt yeah  taliesin proficiency modifier is four dexterity modifier is  matt so 18  taliesin yeah 18  matt all right it rolled a 16 and has a plus four modifier on constitution  so it makes the save  taliesin and marisha damn it  matt sorry  taliesin thats okay i still did a ton of damage  matt yeah explosion the blast took a chunk of its physical form splatters against the side of  the temple that ending your turn /none/ it having no hand at its disposal it glances over with this  slow turning head groans reaches over and grabs a big piece of the stone rubble that was destroyed  from the corner of the temple picks it up over its head grunts and lobs it at you across the  way whoosh whoosh whoosh  marisha groans  matt thats going to be a 21 to hit  taliesin oh that hits  matt that hits you take 28 points of bludgeoning damage and have to make a strength saving throw  taliesin just strength saving throw /none/  matt yep  taliesin no i rolled a one  marisha fuck  matt so it slams into you and knocks you off your feet prone from the sheer impact it rests on  part of your arm and you have to grunts work hard to push it off that will end its turn  taliesin how much damage did it do to me  matt 28  taliesin 28  matt 28 points of bludgeoning damage that ends its go vax youre up  liam im watching everything unfold i see my sister roll up i hold  /none/ matt okay vex  laura i say brother you remember that giant a few years back  liam i remember that giant  laura youre up and i shoot two arrows for my two attacks one into his thigh and one into his  breast right here  matt okay go for it roll for two attacks  liam ooh  laura i dont know which ones to go with  sam they both fail  laura they both hit theyre both 24s  matt both 24s  liam identical  matt both hit yeah roll damage for each  /none/ laura all right thats so crazy  travis same thing  laura yeah plus 14 is 26 26 27 28 29 30 plus hunters mark for both  matt 2d6 on top of that  laura 33 37 points of damage  matt 37 points of damage arrows flying and landing it slams into the knee itself pushing  out the kneecap a little bit from the side of its softened flesh the other one boof sticks and  disappears into its torso you dont even see the impact it pushes through the flesh and vanishes  into its very /none/ large  laura wait the whole arrow goes in i wanted to leave some of it out  matt okay well say for the piece of impact here okay roll a strength check  taliesin i believe in you  matt this is control over your strength on this one  laura 21  matt 21 what did you roll  laura and liam 19  matt whats your strength  laura oh thats saving throw wait wait yeah oh damn it 17  matt 17 i was going to say you have minus two strength i know that  /none/ laura sorry  matt its okay thats still enough gauging pulling back on what little bit of focus you have  as far as restraining youre good at aim restraining is something you have difficulty with  but you release the arrow hitting at a very defined mark shattering part of its rib there in  the front and the arrow sticking out by about a good six inches or so  marisha nice  liam i start running am i within 30 feet its hard to tell from here  matt you are not  liam all right so /none/ i hit one ankle against the other on my boots and everything slows down around  me a little bit and i double my speed and run towards it  matt did you use your boots of haste at the end of last session  liam i dont know  sam its been a long day weve had three sessions  matt i feel like you used it  liam if theres doubt then i cant do it all right i still run at it  matt you could use a bonus action to dash dont forget as a rogue /none/  liam thats what i do hes surrounded by people right so im going to run up to him and im  going to start swinging up the arrows on his chest and get up to his head  matt okay so you run up planting a foot on its thigh leap in the air grab onto the arrow that  vex left in its chest whip upward and while youre in the air towards its face go ahead and  make your attack  taliesin yeah legolas  matt you only get one attack because you used your bonus /none/ action to dash  liam yeah never mind nine is a 20  matt you do have advantage on this if you wish to roll you technically have him flanked with the  other guy  liam thats a 26  matt that hits definitely  liam yeah because hes surrounded all right so im up on his shoulders at this point one plus  seven is eight plus ten 11 16 thats 21 23  matt 23 points of damage  liam yeah with flametongue  matt all righty so as you leap into the air you bring the /none/ blade slam into the center of its face  over one of the eyebrows it slams into the skull and using your weight you tear down dragging the  blade across its face the bone is brittle underneath its flesh and it hacks part of its  face open the bone and teeth immediately become visible its jaw clenches and actually clamps onto  your blade as it reaches the bottom of its face and you catch yourself there for a second the  horrible scent of its rotting flesh hitting your body you manage to take your foot up /none/ push off  pulling the blade out from under its toothy grasp and you land on the ground right beside it big  old jagged gash in the side of its face  liam right  matt cool  liam thats it  matt all right now the rest of the guards are going to go  travis guards  taliesin guards  matt oh natural 20 these are the resistance members  travis i havent had a natural 20 in the game  laura ever  travis in a long time except when i headbutted a fomorian  taliesin /none/ would you like to borrow my die and see if it does anything  travis no you keep your golden snitch  laura i think its just you  sam keep your cheated die all for yourself there  travis harry potter  matt 21 points of damage for the noncriticals  taliesin its hollow  laura what is he doing whats happening over there  matt so all the guards now seeing this opening and these sudden heroes rushing in to attack it  use this opening some have shortswords some have spears they start jamming them into its /none/ sides  beginning to take chunks out of it and basically scraping away its form its mass that is keeping  it aloft through this necromantic enchantment  that ends their turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay so youre on him  liam im not  matt landed beside him now after he pulled the blade out of its face  liam im right below his undead dinger  marisha but theres a ton of people surrounding him  matt correct  sam so light him up  marisha okay im going to kill everybody if i start bringing /none/ down bolts of lightning so im  going to move up a little bit to where im within 30 feet of him over here or something  matt thatll put you just at 30 feet  marisha can i see vax  matt yeah you can barely see vax vax is hard to see period but you can  barely see vax at this point  marisha okay  laura its night hes in black  marisha so looking at the giant and realizing that if i bring lightning down ill just start  electrocuting everybody around i meditate for /none/ a second and go super calm and start casting heat  metal and i start meditating on vaxs daggers  matt okay  marisha so your daggers are going to do an extra 2d8 damage and hes up against a wall correct  matt hes currently up against the edge of the temple yes  marisha okay im going to use my bonus im running fucking low on spells fuck i dont want to  do it im going to do my bonus action to cast grasping

of its attacks and grab the morningstar and with  its second act its going to swing over towards you vax you just slammed into  its face with the dagger  taliesin disadvantage  matt yes  marisha and hes grappled  matt an 11 and a one grappling just prevents movement but yeah he goes in and swings wide and  you just duck out of the way dodge off to the side boosh it slams and gets stuck in the mud  and theres a sucking noise horrible sucking sound as it has /none/ to pull it out of the ground with  all of its might that ends its turn this giants in a bad place youre up  liam what position is it in  matt its currently kneeled forward just pulling its morningstar out of the mud  liam pants i reach down and i grab the scaldinghot daggers again and i lift them up  and lunge and sink into its ribs  matt okay you take 2d8 points of fire damage roll it keyleth  marisha so does he right because thats kind of badass seven points of damage /none/  liam oh you roll seven or eight yeah  matt you pick up the daggers take the damage lift them up to go in for the attack  roll for the attack  liam the first one hits thats a 30 and the second one is 17 and hes still surrounded so  the first one is going to sneak attack his ass two plus three nine ten 11 12 15 16 17  matt all right  liam 17 on the second attack flametongue gets seven  matt seven okay  laura plus 2d8 for your fire damage /none/  liam oh plus 2d8 for the fire damage  marisha does he also get the fire damage  liam thats a yeah if i get burned he gets burned right  matt ill allow it thats not usually how the spell works ill allow it for this circumstance  since youre taking the damage to do the attack ill let it happen  liam all right 14  matt okay so as youre holding the daggers with the searing pain you reach up slash both daggers  down into the front of its body and you drag across you /none/ can see its chest breaks open and it  groans stumbles backward the air expiring from its throat roars it pushes up against it  holding onto that shred of undeath that it currently has in its body not falling to your  measly blows that ends your turn do you want to move at all  liam i didnt move can i use a bonus action at this point  matt you used a bonus action for your second attack  liam second attack okay  matt yeah because youre not hasted all right go for it vex  /none/ laura okay im going to shoot him two times through my blazing bowstring which i still have  one left of  matt first strike will be the blazing bowstring  laura yeah  matt okay  laura that hits second one hits too  matt all right  laura okay whats the blazing bowstring again 1d10 okay  liam youve got a lot of papers in there  laura i know i do have a lot of little papers six plus seven is 13 14 15 plus fire damage  21 plus hunters mark 22 for the first hit /none/  matt hold on  liam get it  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  laura oh that feels so good as hes bent over i want to  liam youre wearing the shirt even  laura i know im wearing the shirt as hes bent over and i just saw my brother attack him with  fire i hit him with fire again straight through the eyeball thats remaining through the back of  his head  matt okay so as you release the arrow itself you can feel the warmth licking the side /none/ of your  face as the arrow heats up release it it shoots through the air like a tracer dart just arrow  whizzing the giant which is currently reaching back it has a palm out like its going to try to  palm vax after the attack as it reaches up groans it just arrow whizzing into the back of  the eye and as it sinks inside its head thud theres this dull thud sound like the fire burst  on the inside of its head its other eye explosion plumps out and hangs out the side as /none/  fire darts out from that open socket its jaw goes slack and it begins to lurch forward towards you  and the guy next to it both of you guys step back out of the way as it moans thuds onto the muddy  ground in front of you  laura pants  matt everyone takes a breath for a second  liam i start sticking my hands in a puddle  laura i run up with trinket to the guards  marisha i go up to start seeing if i can salvage anything from this giant  liam /none/ like my hands  marisha do i see vax with his hands in the mud  matt yes you see him currently putting out his hands  marisha what did what  liam could you fix these  marisha oh did it work though im sorry  liam yeah it worked its good but they sting a little bit  marisha okay i put my hands in his hands and cast cure wounds  matt okay  marisha im going to use it from my ring my spellslot ring  matt what level  marisha ill do level two  /none/ matt level two okay so 2d8 plus six  marisha 12  matt so you heal 12 hit points  liam i heal i also hold her hands for a second  laura i walk through and bust through their hands  travis there you go  laura i want to talk to the guards  matt the guards who currently are checking to make sure its dead theyre stabbing its body  taliesin putting the guns away and walking over to the guards as well  matt okay you notice they look like guards at first glance because the /none/ armor theyre wearing is  the same type of armor that the guards youve encountered here wear but theyre all underneath  the armor wearing rags farmers clothing whatevers available its still uniform armor and  weapon design to anyone whos worked in whitestone  sam are any of them in berets  matt you dont know because youre not there  sam damn it  liam are they unsullied  matt laughs  laura i put my hand on one of their shoulders and say you showed great bravery here  matt thank you thank you for coming and /none/ helping that got a little hairy there for a  minute we didnt lose any of our men thankfully and thats thanks to you he reaches up for a  second and wipes this black blood stuck to his chin from the fight so whats next  laura now we rest up you heal and you get ready to attack tomorrow  matt all right what time  taliesin tomorrow at dawn we take the castle  matt all right men  taliesin spread the word  laura dawn  matt dawn dawn it is sheathes his weapon the other /town/ men stand up and one of them makes one  final stab into the body of the zombie like yeah take that they begin to walk  back towards town  marisha before he runs off i tell him tell everyone to look for the sign of  pelor in the sky  matt one of them goes pelor right three of them run back to the doorway of the temple and  they all stop for a second and give a silent prayer to themselves and then join the rest of  their crew as they go walking back /none/ towards the city  marisha what time is it right now  matt right now its hard to tell  laura hopefully its a while until dawn  matt its about two hours past sunset  laura oh good weve got time thats good  liam i pull out my flametongue dagger and just look in two or three graves i dont know if  theres anything in there  sam are you trying to grave rob right now  matt make an investigation check  liam theyre empty man that is a 15  taliesin youre literally going to /none/ steal from my greatgrandfather  liam im just looking  taliesin all right  matt glancing about you notice that the coffins are still there at the bottom but theyre all  open the lids are off and theyre empty entirely whatever body is gone best you can  glance about the most that you can find most of them are just laid to rest one of them seems to  be laid to rest with what looks to be a nice ornamental dagger of some kind thats left to  their side  travis fucking do it  laura /none/ and liam laugh  marisha it could be cursed  travis do whatever you want im not here  liam are you giving me morality lessons  travis im not even here  taliesin im going to check my family grave the family crypt  matt there actually is an undercroft in your castle  taliesin oh thats right  liam i want to drop down im going to take a look at that yeah  laura youre going to go get the dagger  liam im going to look at it  laura that ornamental dagger  matt so /none/ you leap down into the grave  liam tell me more about that dagger  matt from what you can see from up there it just looks like a fairly nice dagger it has a little  like gold sheen to it and looks like theres gems encrusted in it from this distance  laura all right go get it  laughter  laura it looks shiny  matt so you leap down into the grave drop your feet hitting against the wooden bottom of the  coffin smells musty and its been rained in heavily so its not as /none/ bad as it could be it  looks to be a pretty dagger you reach for it and pick it up and look at it its lightweight its  ornamental its not actually more of a functional  liam i want to make an arcana check  laura its ornamental  liam i just want to make an arcana check  matt go for it go for it  liam its a 20  matt natural 20  liam no 20  matt okay take a look at it there doesnt appear to be enough of a rune structure even /none/ on  this dagger to give it like a formal enchantment it looks ritualistic and ornamental its probably  worth a pretty penny but it is not a  liam i put it down and i pat it and i  matt climb back up out of the grave  laura he doesnt know  marisha can i salvage anything from the stone giant  liam tourist im a tourist  matt go ahead and make a wisdom check just roll a d20 add your six to it  marisha just a wisdom check  matt yep  marisha 12 /none/ total  matt 12 looking over the body this entity and anything that would be functional on the stone  giants body is far rotted and necrosis has taken hold on a lot of the body parts nothing here  would be of use in any way shape or form plus stone giants dont really have any magical  components to their body theyre just larger humanoids what small trophies you could take from  it you could sell here and there for a little bit of change are also rotted and corroded by its  undead form that it /none/ wouldnt be worth it  liam their teeth are good for 1d8s though  matt laughs this is true all right so whats the plan  laura we should head west  marisha head west meet up  matt all right so you guys  laura i take the little bit of dust of tracelessness that we had taken from grog and i  try to sprinkle it on our tracks as we go and cover up our tracks  matt okay as you pull the dust out of your pouch you look at it and its turned to just /none/  sand it seems that the dust of tracelessness is effective when only pulled and used directly out  of its pouch  travis by its designated flower girl  matt if taken out remotely and left on its own for a while it becomes magically inert  laura well then i use my ranger skills to try to make it look like our tracks are hidden  taliesin i know the city well enough to take us through a relatively  matt yes this is one of those few circumstances where percys almost more helpful than you are as /none/  far as making your way through the two of you together very helpful you guys have been making  your way through the city making westward to meet up with the rest of the party against the wall on  the western side of whitestone and with that were going to go ahead and take a quick bathroom  break bring in some snacks so hang tight guys well be back here in just a minute  laura i love you pike  break  matt welcome back everyone so picking up where we left off eventually the longesttraveling /none/  group would be the one that went all the way to the zenith the temple of pelor eventually the  rain still heavily coming down you guys keeping warm and out of the way to the far far western  wall kind of keeping behind a bush the rest of the party arrives the gnomes and goliath  barbarian waiting for you as you approach  laughter  liam taking your pee break now  matt so the rest of you guys gather what are you doing whats your plan  travis were against the wall should we stay /none/ in the treeline  laura we need to hide  sam how is everyone did you defeat your giant  laura totally did  sam you know who defeated ours pike because shes the fucking bomb  marisha pike weve missed you so much  sam pike come here and give me a hug i give her a hug what happens  matt okay laughs you go and hug her and its one of those things where because her form it  feels like youre grabbing almost a warm energetic gelatin in a way like her form isnt  purely /none/ physical  sam just how i remember you warm gelatin  matt and there is this hot wind that wraps around her and her hair is drifting a little bit theres  something her physical form is very strange here  marisha how did you get here pike how did you know  ashley well as you guys know ive been working at the temple and its been very hard work  laughs and i i just i think about you all constantly and every day i felt a heaviness and  ive had these visions of terrible things and /none/ i felt a disturbance in the force  laughter  ashley but today it became too much  matt you had received a letter from allura from emon if you recall  ashley i received a letter  laughter  ashley i received a letter from allura and i felt that you guys are you guys making a  decision or something here in whitestone  sam many decisions weve decided to take down this horrible foe and percys been grappling with  a lot of decisions as weve gone  laura pike maybe you could help him  marisha /none/ yeah can you take a look at him pike i believe its out of my realm of understanding  travis actually percys just fine maybe she looks at him after the briarwoods  taliesin well  marisha there was a long pause  ashley that was a very long pause  travis percy how are you feeling  taliesin honestly if pike werent here id say fine but sighs how do you think i am pike  ashley well most of my my heaviness and visions were about you  taliesin sighs  ashley ive been in deep prayer and /dung/ meditation and i know you guys were in a very dark place and  i prayed that sarenrae would send me to you and so here i am sort of as an avatar but im here  and i want to help in any way that i can i just know somethings off and i dont quite know what  that is yet  matt her form shimmers for a second almost like the energy that keeps her corporeal in this  location for a moment flickers and then she is restored to her form you get the sense that /none/  marisha this isnt going to last long  matt that shes not actually physically here this divine projection is a channeling of  sarenraes power keeping her here for the moment  laura damn sarenrae is really freaking powerful  marisha yeah i have a feeling shes probably using a lot of energy to do this too pike do  you know how much longer you can stay in this form that you can stay with us  ashley i dont know this is the first time that ive ever done this so im hoping that it will  /none/ last a long time at least to see you through  travis oh us too  laura us too  ashley fake crying  travis hey pike do you want to take percys temperature  laura should we find a place to hide first  ashley yeah were still in the open right  taliesin theres a secret entrance to the castle to the west in the woods i think perhaps if we  made our way there we could  marisha get inside  taliesin camp out perhaps it would be a roof over our heads if we got /none/ there and we could take  care of anyone  sam percys thinking very clearly hes fine  laura hes rubbing his eyes a lot  marisha hes had this weird cough for a couple of days now  sam hes allergic to cats or something  taliesin im not allergic to cats  laura pike he has black smoke coming out of his body all the time  sam i have lightning coming out of my ass  laura yeah well you choose to do that  taliesin lets make our way to somewhere quiet  marisha well have /none/ her look at you there i do a gust to do that air umbrella thing  around all of us  matt that really terrible one that doesnt work well  marisha yeah the really terrible one im doing that to help keep us shielded from the rain  matt okay are you guys coasting within the citys walls or are you moving outside of the  citys walls  laura outside of the city  matt okay so you find your way a little bit southward  laura stealthing  matt stealthing to make your way outside of the /none/ city into the forest surrounding the outskirts of  whitestone make a stealth check guys this is without the plus ten bonus because you dont have  any more spells  laura i dont  travis yeah oh really i get plus two to stealth  matt grog  travis 18  laura ooh 20  liam 23  sam 12  marisha 17  taliesin 15 with disadvantage  matt okay  sam and pike  laura pike what did you roll for stealth shes an apparition  ashley i rolled a ten  matt you rolled a ten /none/  laura clang  ashley ten  matt okay  taliesin clang clang clang  matt all right as you guys move into the forest the boughs of the trees do help offset some of the  rain but there is still some rain making it through and there is a heavy drip through the  leaves you start pushing through you make your way out id say a good five minutes to the west  of the city before you start heading northward both percy and vex taking lead on this you being  the natural stalker you knowing /none/ these lands quite well  as percy presses along coughing and keeping his eyes peeled you press on for about 30 minutes to  the north the rain begins to subside a little bit and you can hear the occasional cracking  noise sound of these strange growling catlike noises you know that some of the indigenous  creatures of the sierras  taliesin do i know what this sound is  matt youve heard this before its nothing terribly dangerous theyre just natural catlike  creatures that live in the trees ocelotlike theyre indigenous to this region thats them /none/  communicating its initially offsetting but you keep pushing forward i would have both of you  guys make survival checks  laura whispering survival checks  taliesin i dont think ive ever rolled that before  marisha come on city boy  laura oh i have advantage  matt thats true and you would have advantage actually because you know this area  laura really did that just happen  liam wow she rolled two threes in a row  laura ive got to retire it its so beautiful and i keep trying it  travis its certainly the /none/ die and not you in any way  laura its just been punishing me as of late  taliesin 14  matt 14 okay  laura ten  matt the two of you working together on this it takes you an hour or so before you eventually  get further enough north and out of the outskirts of whitestone where you begin to see the rising  platform the small central forest mesa that the castle whitestone is built upon you can see  through the heavy cloud cover what little bit of torch light is visible from some of /dung/ the castle interior  in the distance its this ominous dark shape outlined against the cloud cover above you  liam on that walk while theyre leading the way i quietly walk alongside pike and fill her in on  everything i have seen happen with percival the smoke coming out of him the darker turn in his  personality the way that he branded that man everything that i am worried about  sam the cough  liam the cough everything so that shes filled in on his darker turn  matt okay did you get that ashley  /none/ ashley i did  matt so pressing on eventually catching the edge of that mountain that to you is the  inclination you know this area very well spending most of your time living around this  castle you gesture for the rest of the group to follow you up towards the edge of this central  mountain platform that the castles upon eventually coasting along the side i want you  to make an investigation check percy  taliesin 16  matt 16 okay pushing forward you spend a good 20 minutes walking back and forth youre pretty  /none/ sure that this is where the entrance is and looking along this area you make your way to the  northern side of this mountain no entrance seems to be appearing to you theres no opening  theres no doorway it was a cavern exit that was loosely hidden by a series of bushes that were  clustered around it  taliesin it should be around here  laura can i start taking a look around and  see if i see anything  liam all of us yeah  travis we should be very careful these two are good /dung/ at using their brain muscles could be an  ambush  liam 26 on perception  laura thats way better than mine 17  matt okay about ten minutes of you guys searching as you travel southward among this  okay you guys watch along the wall and nothing seems to be catching your eye you notice that  theres a portion of the mountainside that is looser rock everything here is solid longeroded  through weather and time there is one section that appears to have more of a crumbly loose rock  that forms the lower portion of /none/ the wall  liam big guy come here  travis what  liam this is new these havent been here long im not very strong do you  want to start hucking rocks  travis wait say that again  liam i am extremely fast and nimble and could totally fuck you up but i cant lift that much  including door jambs could you help me move these rocks  travis i suppose i go and i start moving rocks  liam you look very handsome in that beard  matt okay make an athletics check  marisha laughs /none/ oh shit  travis never forget 18  matt 18 okay you go over and start pulling the rocks away a lot of the ones at the very surface  are pretty small and youre pushing them aside and rolling off eventually you start getting to the  base of this area and you can see now there are a cluster of bushes that have long died and are  crushed under these rocks  taliesin does this look familiar to me  matt this would be similar to the placement of where the bushes were that originally obscured the /none/  crawlspace that led into this tunnel  taliesin i think this might be it  laura well what happened here  sam did they blow it  laura does it look like a cavein like somebody did it on purpose  marisha can i do a nature check to see if this is natural or mandone  matt sure go for it  sam mandone  marisha i think thats a 21  matt 21  marisha yeah 21  matt inspecting this the pattern in which it fell was very localized which leads you to  believe  /none/ marisha i think this was blasted down  matt yeah this was blasted or was intentionally done to demolish this exit as opposed to a natural  fall at this point in time youve pulled through a few of the larger rocks and you roll them over  and you do reveal a small tunnel  travis hey look i found a hole  marisha good work grog  matt about 15 minutes of pushing this stuff out of the way before you eventually find it and its  probably a good ten feet inward  sam can we get /none/ in it  matt its tight but you can start moving in there  liam scanlan squish in there  sam well we have two gnomes with us  liam shell light up the hole  sam i hope so  laughter  sam i will shimmy in just to see whats down there  matt okay you make your way into this lower tunnel a bit sharp in there black as night no  light source the ground itself is very dry which is a nice change from the rather wet exterior  awaiting you outside it generally smells /dung/ musty and seems disused and very dark  liam i lean down and say does it look like somewhere that we can rest for the night  sam oi i cant see anything  laughter  sam you got a torch up there or something  liam i flip my flametongue dagger over backwards and hand it to him through this little hole  matt okay you take the dagger  sam this feels so cool its like a shortsword for me  laughter  matt with the flickering light along the blade it lights up the area the tunnel /none/ widens up to  roughly eight to ten feet wide and seems to curl forward before disappearing around a gradual edge  about 50 feet ahead of you its about six feet tall so the taller of you folk are going to have  to crouch in but its about six feet tall about eight to ten feet wide and that continues to curl  deeper in towards the mountain  sam no one down here but i dont know how far this thing goes and i dont know how well its  guarded  travis are there trees around /none/ us  matt yeah no more than maybe five feet off this mountain line the forest grows immediately  dense  marisha if theyve blasted in the entrance i have a feeling  taliesin i dont think theyre expecting anyone from here  marisha theyre not expecting people  liam this was taken care of in their minds i say we squeeze grog and trinket in here  sam and camp in the tunnel  liam yeah ill go ahead a bit and take a quick peekypoo  travis you dont think theyll patrol this area  liam no  /none/ laura does it seem like theres cobwebs does it seem dusty and disused  matt if you crawl inside to look  marisha are we inside lets all crawl in  matt as you guys all may your way inside glancing about make an investigation check  marisha i light up my hands  sam i put vaxs dagger in my back pocket cover it up with my shirt  matt okay make a sleightofhand check  laura 20  matt okay yeah theres been no footsteps in here for quite some time  sam seven  laura this has /none/ definitely been disused disused is that a good word  taliesin abandoned  laura abandoned is a better word  matt as shes saying this you look over and scanlan almost looks at you directly and goes  like he grabs your wrist and stops you  liam i use the other hand and i tweak his nose as hard as i can  sam not in front of pike  laughter  matt daggers retrieved  taliesin pike can you take a look at this cough before we take a rest  marisha yeah take a look at him /none/ pike  travis are we in the tunnel  matt youre in the tunnel right now  travis i grab some of the boulders and cover up the way we came in or just a boulder and move it  to the mouth of it or is it too big  matt you can move a few theres no boulders quite large enough to fully close it off you can  do it it will take you a little bit of time but you can do it  travis yeah just to cover it up a little  matt okay /none/  ashley are there two openings the one that we came in and then the rest of the tunnel  matt the tunnel continues and curves out of sight about 50 feet in  laura but we blocked up the one we came through  travis oh keyleth can you make a fucking bush grow in front of this thing  laura or can you put up a wall to where we dont have to worry  travis so if whoever was going by with those dogs while we were up in the trees the first night we  got /none/ here comes by and sees a hole in the wall  marisha okay  taliesin how many spells do you have left  marisha sighs thats the question it depends on if were going to decide to  taliesin i think we should take a rest  laura we have to rest yes  marisha ill think about it  laura okay  matt okay  ashley could i put a guardian of faith above us before we make our  sam of course you can  matt lets see how long that lasts for  travis a what  /none/ laura a what  matt yeah it lasts for eight hours  liam we came to a land of evil without  matt yes you can  laura i cant believe we came without pike ever  ashley im sorry  laura pike stay with us forever  ashley okay  liam or at least through next week  matt all right so as you guys are having this conversation pike grabs her holy symbol for a  second closes her eyes and focuses and the energy around her that slightly drifting  ethereal divine energy seems to shift away /none/ from her for a second and then coalesce into what looks  like a floating ghostly armored entity that apparates in the air beside her her form once  again becomes whole and she looks towards it and gives it a nod and the armored entity seems to  acknowledge with a strange head nod and then turns towards the inner side of the tunnel and begins  patrolling a small section of the tunnel on its own  laura wow well there you go  ashley okay  liam i think to myself oh that is badass  laughter /none/  laura i smack her on her little gelatin back and say good work pike  ashley laughs i go over to percy percy how are you  taliesin i dont know ive had a cough and im complicated  marisha i did a check on him pike his cough doesnt seem to be anything natural or  diseaserelated so its nothing like a fever not a real one anyway  ashley oh boy okay can i do any extra check on him  travis yep drop your pants  matt you can make a medicine check on him  /none/ liam youre getting the radiant digit  ashley did anybody already do a medicine check  matt you havent made one  ashley all right ill give it a go  marisha quietly come on pike  ashley 17  matt 17 okay you take a moment to inspect percy looking at his features checking his  pulse and generally getting a sense of his life force in general his eyes are sunken his jowls  are shadowed from what you recall of percy he was always a seeminglyhealthy if on the thin and  pale side individual doubly more /none/ so than youve ever seen him there is an unrest to his energy  and there is no physical natural illness or discernible disease but there is something  unsettling about his presence that youve never sensed before  ashley sighs okay lesser restoration would that do anything in this situation  laura what about greater restoration  matt you can try it lesser or greater restoration  marisha if you have a greater restoration pike i dont have it on me  ashley okay i can try it can i try it  matt yeah if you want to /none/  ashley okay  matt so what are you casting lesser or greater restoration  ashley ill do greater do you mind percy  taliesin no sighs no  matt okay so pike reaches up you grab his face again and you close your eyes and concentrate  her hands begin to glow with an extremely bright vibrance even moreso than her gently luminescent  form right now its almost like theres a blowtorch of radiant energy right around his jaw  the rest of her form almost seems to put so much energy into it that her legs begin /none/ to dissipate  and vanish almost like shes putting all of her energy into this moment the rest of her body  fading into the grasp  you feel this warmth wash through your entire body and for a brief moment for the first time  in a number of weeks theres a moment of serenity to you your eyes instinctually close and for a  second you feel like youre standing next to pike in a void of darkness  as that warmth hits pike you sense something there you sense a seed of darkness theres  something in /none/ him that you can almost reach out and grasp and in that imaginative space you do you  thrust your hand out and grab onto it and its taut and its fighting but you pull and wrest  it forth and as you do you feel it burn and dissipate at which point both of you guys open  your eyes breathe in succession with each other the energy fades from your hands and your form  goes back to its full radiant physicality  you can remove a corruption point from yourself  sam ooh  laura yay  /none/ marisha a corruption point  matt yes  sam he had two  laura okay  matt hes still looking a little sickly but definitely improved  taliesin did i heal as well  matt no you just lose a corruption point  marisha so does that get rid of one of his weird ailments  sam he still coughs  taliesin i do feel better  matt the cough is still there  liam i watched all of that and when i saw him lean back into the earthen wall i quietly back up  and im going to /none/ go down the tunnel like 50 feet and see  matt roll a stealth check  sam pike that was incredible  liam 23  ashley what is a corruption point  matt you have no idea what a corruption point is but you removed some point of corruption  in his body  travis can you do me next my neck has been hurting for weeks  ashley laughs  laura i do that to grog hows that feel hows that feel big guy  travis oh its much better  matt almost like a small seed of sentient /none/ tumor you removed from him  taliesin should i randomize which corruption point vanishes  matt its a compounding thing  taliesin oh its compounding  matt yeah theyre not specific  ashley how many do you have  matt you dont know you have no idea  ashley sorry im asking too many questions  matt yeah how dare you no its fine  ashley how do you feel percy  taliesin i feel better i feel more like myself coughs  laura but hes still coughing  taliesin im still coughing but i feel much better thank you /none/  marisha what did you just do to him pike  ashley i just tried to find out what this is this is going to sound like a very weird question  but does part of you want to hold onto some of this  taliesin it could be im not quite finished yet well see where we are tomorrow  ashley okay  matt while this is happening vax has vanished ahead into the tunnel on his own you guys look  around and realize that hes nowhere to be seen  travis fuck him i go to sleep /none/  laughter  matt okay vax pushing ahead thankfully in the darkness you have a little bit of vision limited  as it is  liam from the glowing gnome  matt make a perception check as you turn around the corner you lose the light source  liam 20  matt okay you continue around the edge and the tunnel evens out for a bit and then goes straight  and then curves again to the left following that it curves again to the right you can keep going  or you can head back youve traversed about 60 /none/ or 70 feet in this tunnel  liam 60 or 70 feet im going to go another 60 or 70 feet  sam yeah  laura where the fuck are you  matt you keep pushing towards this tunnel and turn to the right you travel a bit further  forward and as the tunnel makes another sharp right turn you see all of a sudden where the dirt  stops and there is solid smooth stonework a broken portion of what looks like the back side of  a wall of some kind you see nothing beyond it it /none/ looks like there is a piece of stone something  pressed against it and looks like some other things are stacked basically covering this  entrance  liam i would like to just sit down on the ground and close my eyes and listen for a full minute and  see if i hear anything  matt make a perception check  liam 21  matt 21 you take a minute close your eyes and take in all audio you can stillness quiet  nothing  liam pretty good i quietly walk all the way back and walk behind the /none/ group and i go goosh  look at that  laura i swear to pelor if you would have gotten us killed  marisha where did you go just then  liam i was like ten feet around the corner  sam he was right here the whole time  taliesin im going to take care of a little business outside and then well seal up the  opening  sam excuse me what are you doing outside  taliesin im going to charge the diplomacy glove  matt its already sealed grog already sealed it  taliesin grog already /none/ sealed it  matt yeah he pulled rocks into it and closed the exit  laura i glare at vax and i lay down to go to sleep  sam can we do it here  taliesin we cant do it in here because it would make too much noise  marisha this room wont fit my storm cloud  sam wait pike do you have any sort of cone of silence or anything do you have a cone of  silence  marisha why  sam hes going to make noise  marisha no its not going to work /none/  liam ive got this i pick up two small roundish ovalshaped stones from the ground and  i slide them into grogs nostrils plugging them up  matt make a sleightofhand check grog whats your passive perception  travis oh ten  matt okay  sam wheres passive perception  laura its under all your other attributes  liam 14  matt okay as you step away theres a snort as your nostrils are stopped up now and the airflow  is impeded partially from the way youre used to you begin breathing heavily through the mouth in  /none/ reaction  travis loud snoring  laura i wake up to the terrible ugh what is that grog  travis and i cough and the stones shoot out of my nose back at vax  laughter  travis with a high velocity  liam im removing one hit point from my  matt yeah one beans you in the side of the temple  travis covered

the guardian  sam the guardians got this  marisha i look at vax before we go to sleep and i say not going to pull any more jenga moments  are you  liam no no im not  marisha you sure because you just

laughter  liam im going to go sit down by percy and what id like to do is watch everybody nod off and in /none/  20 minutes nudge him awake  taliesin groans  liam hi  taliesin yes  liam i want you to get some sleep but i want to talk for a minute  taliesin i dont know if i can do both of those things but okay  liam thats all right we can separate them this thing  taliesin yes  liam what do you really know about it how do we know that this thing isnt whispering in sylass  ear what do you really know about this thing  taliesin i dont know anything about this thing /none/ except that this last time this last time was  different than the first time this last time didnt sighs this last time i felt more like  me and less like i was being drawn somewhere i wasnt entirely me but its hard to describe i  felt like i had contained it a bit i feel like maybe maybe i can keep it under check  i dont know  liam i want to tell you something were almost like family now and ive seen you do many great  things and you have earned my trust but /none/ if you hurt my sister if you hurt anyone else in this  group inadvertently  taliesin i would expect no less  liam all right then  taliesin vax i

taliesin no im running really low no  liam just a finger dab  taliesin no oh god yes  liam i lick /none/ my pinky and i put it in and i slowly draw a big ballsack on grogs forehead  matt roll a sleightofhand check  liam sure  taliesin im going to sleep before this happens  liam thats a 23  matt grog roll a perception check just for the hell of it  travis 18  matt deftly blended in with the tattoos unless those who are aware there are strange new series  of markings across grogs face that he may not notice for quite some time  liam i did do little hairs on them as well /none/  matt oh how detailed  liam well it grows here so it grows there  matt you dont know laughs  liam i dont know or do i  matt oh all right you guys go to sleep  liam he goes to sleep im going to do my duty with keyleth for a watch  laura no keyleth went to sleep  liam i thought we were both staying up  matt you look back over at keyleth and shes asleep  liam all right ill watch everybody  matt are you going to sleep at all  /none/ liam ill stay up for two hours  matt you stay up for the two hours there doesnt seem to be much incident whatsoever theres that  gentle draft coming through from some of the cracks in the stones that were set up to block the  entryway it was not a perfect hole of course just enough to not arouse suspicion there is cold  air seeping through you can hear the rain muffled in the distance and theres a little bit of a  leak coming through from where the stones were set up to block the entrance /none/ eventually sleep comes  to you it is a strange lulling sound everyone sleeps relatively comfortably for being in the  middle of a stone tunnel  you have dreams again dreams images flashes flashes of your family hanging from the sun tree  it never happened but your mind creates the image for you you see flashes of your sister screaming  out to you as the arrows take her in the chest you see a flash of what looks like a skull a  skull face the skull brings itself to where you focus on one of its /none/ ocular sockets and blood  begins to pour from the socket flash to black a familiar voice rings out again  do not forget our deal  cold morning air comes to you as you all slowly come to consciousness uncomfortable kinks in  your back its not the best place to sleep but the bare minimum of the long rest is achieved  throughout the evening as you all eventually come to and check and make sure everyones okay you  awake a little unnerved  sam i look around for pike  laura is she still here  /none/ matt pike is just waking up shes still there her image you can see in her sleeping state is  diminished when she comes to consciousness it almost flares up again her presence here is  purely a force of will and that connection is a very tenuous one  i would like everyone to make a constitution check  laura constitution  marisha corruption man  laura yeah youre right im going to go sparkle stone  liam natural 20  marisha son of a fuck natural one my third of the evening  sam five  matt five /none/  travis 17  laura 16  liam 20  taliesin 22  matt all righty  laura you rolled a one keyleth  marisha i had bad dreams  matt the dc on this is not as high everyone but keyleth passed keyleth as you wake up theres a  general cold sensation within your body and you feel like theres really no way to keep warm no  matter how hard you try and bundle up you even use a bit of druidcraft to create a bit of  sparkling warm fire that you use to keep your /none/ hands set and the cold doesnt seem to go away  marisha i keep my hands aflame and kind of rub myself  matt okay your hands are shaking unnaturally and theres a general chatter to your teeth you  have disadvantage on any dexterity ability checks  marisha glad i dont use a bow  matt skill checks wouldnt affect attacks i will say it doesnt really affect initiative per  se but if you were to try to do any delicate handwork you would have disadvantage  laura should we before we get this shit going have a /none/ feast a big fucking feast  sam we should have a feast  marisha that sounds good yeah  laura we still have a couple of feasts left  marisha i will say if we choose to feast i will not be able to sunbeam  sam well that is a problem  laura should we have feasted last night  marisha i couldnt i burned my sunbeam we couldnt have done it  sam pike cant help in any way  marisha i dont know if pike  ashley i dont have that ability  marisha does she have /none/ access to sixthlevel spells we havent leveled pike up in a while  ashley i dont know if ive  matt youve gained a modicum of experience while you were away from the party just at a slower  rate so you are at a lower level than the rest of the party not by a terrible amount but youd be  level 11 by now probably  marisha so she would have a sixthlevel spell  laura so she has feast  marisha it depends on if clerics have it  matt clerics do have access to heroes feast /none/  ashley let me check  marisha but that would also mean pike burning her 6thlevel spell slot  matt correct so you would have one 6thlevel spell if you wanted to you could prepare that as  your prepared 6thlevel spell for the day that is your choice pike  laura we get saves on all wisdom throws which might come in handy when were fighting against  things that control our minds  ashley oh dang i havent even looked through these yet  liam while the fancy people are talking i walk over to grog and say /none/ big man youve got mud or  something on your face come here and i take my hand and i wipe across his forehead and smear out  what i did  travis dont fucking touch me  liam sorry  laughter  travis youre all cuddly in the morning and shit god get it together  liam sorry  travis i lean over to vex and i go how do i look  laura you look lovely dear  travis damn right  sam i have questions for us while pike is looking up her spells first question is /town/ how on  earth are we supposed to send a signal to the rest of the town when were in a tunnel  laura we can open it up  sam from where  laura from here  taliesin once were inside the castle well be able to  marisha i can skywrite again  laura you could skywrite right now as soon as we decide to start moving  marisha i just need to move the boulders a bit  laura yeah open the rocks up people start attacking the castle we come from the other side  from /none/ within  sam is that our plan were going to say rebels go wait a while and then attack  taliesin not even wait a while well go in  laura go in at the same time  liam we throw the signal to the sky and go up this tunnel  sam shouldnt we wait a little  laura wait like five minutes to let them rabble up and start running  sam remember last time i was supposed to create a diversion  laura yeah but then you took down a whole house  taliesin well we had /town/ a grog  sam believe me i was amazing but maybe we should incite the rebellion wait a half hour and  then go  taliesin lets see if we can keep civilian casualties to a reasonably small amount  marisha were the most capable people in this town right now  sam well thats another question we are does one of us need to go out there and lead the  rebels  laura and taliesin no  taliesin were fine  sam what do you mean no  marisha theyve got yennan hes awesome he was a badass /none/ cleric  sam if he survived the night  travis what if they dont take the rebels seriously because were not with them maybe one  of us should go  sam maybe pike should  taliesin i think its going to take all of us to defeat the briarwoods  laura i think we all need to go together  taliesin once the briarwoods are gone i think a lot of this will get a lot easier  travis we could meet in the middle  sam im just saying if pike is fading on us it might be /none/ best to send her out to lead the rebels  laura no shes not fading on us you dick shes coming with us  liam scanlan were going to make a leap of faith that pike can stay  sam and if in the horribly unfortunate scenario where she cant pike can you leave us anything  laura a heroes fucking feast  sam a potion a spell a prayer a symbol a siggle anything  matt a sigil  sam oh oh a sigil i said it wrong  liam oh prepare to be gifd mercer  matt laughs /none/ yeah  ashley wow theres some amazing just a side note theres one called heal that can heal a  person 70 hit points  matt true  ashley just like that  laura thats pretty awesome  matt so heroes feast heal youve got to pick one  laura heroes feast  sam heroes feast raises all of our hit points higher  liam way to humblebrag pike  laura it makes us more badass  ashley yeah lets do the heroes feast then  marisha were going to eat up fuck yeah  matt all right so mark /none/ off your other thousand gold chalice that you had purchased beforehand i think  youre out now arent you  marisha yes i believe we need to go shopping  laura you needed one more you had one more i thought  matt she has one more its being used right now shed purchased two before you left  marisha pike you wouldnt happen to have a thousand goldworth chalice on you would you  liam only astrally  marisha never mind  matt i would think probably not  marisha dont worry about it  matt you hand over /none/ the chalice to pike pike you take the chalice and you set it down before you  you mark a symbol in the dirt in the center of this tunnel in the shape of a giant rectangular  table you take your holy symbol remove it from your neck and thrust it into the ground at the  head of the table with that dust kicks up as seemingly out of nowhere this giant table and  feast just fwoosh rises  laura oh my god is it a holy feast do we all do holy damage now  matt /none/ no but holy shit its delicious  travis laughing holy shit its delicious  laughter  matt it is very good  liam best line of the night  matt benches around and available you all sit around it and dig into the most delightful  midtunnel cold subcastle breakfast youve ever had  liam ice cream  laura give me that pencil  matt so you guys all for the next 24 hours have advantage on wisdom saving throws and i believe  its 2d6 is that what it was marisha  marisha 2d10 or 2d8  matt ill /none/ look it up right here  taliesin wisdom advantage  laura i think its 2d12  marisha 2d12  matt heroes feast nope 2d10 everyone roll 2d10 and add that temporary hit points to your hp  value that includes you too pike so roll 2d10 and thats temporary hit points on top of your  regular hit points meaning once those go away they cannot be healed back  liam still not cracking a hundred  taliesin nice  sam and advantage on wisdom saves  marisha and were immune to fear  matt yep  sam seriously  /none/ marisha and poison i think  matt yep youre immune to poison  marisha immune to fear immune to poison and immune to what else  matt and you get advantage on all wisdom saving throws heroes feast motherfucker  liam immune to fear and what was it  matt immune to fear and poison oh such a good spell very expensive but damn  if it hasnt been clutch  marisha im going to move out some rocks just enough where i can peek out are we ready to go  sam go go where what  laura to /dung/ do this  marisha im just going to start this we can talk as we go  sam youve got to go outside first  marisha im going outside  sam okay  marisha im going outside is it still rainy  matt it is not raining currently the sky is still cloudy and dark  marisha still cloudy  matt yeah  marisha okay so i take the clouds and i darken them and do a giant de rolo crest that expands  over the whole city  matt okay so with grogs help you move some of the /dung/ rocks out of the way you get a visual of the  sky you lean out focus cast your skywrite spell mark that spell off and as you coalesce  the clouds to be extremely dark and to form the de rolo crest symbol in the sky as that happens you  begin to see about two minutes later little beacon lights begin to ignite across the city  lanterns and torches being lit it looks like as it is probably an hour past dawn that the  surviving remainder of the whitestone rebellion is raring itself to attack  /none/ laura we should have sung one day more  sam well we still can laughs before we do this i love you all and i wish us all the best  of luck today i especially love pike and im so happy shes with us for this if some of us dont  return i think that the glory of what were doing today and the justice of what were doing today  has been worth it and percy i hope you get some sort of redemption in all of this  taliesin sighs  marisha to the de rolos /none/  sam to the de rolos  marisha to whitestone  taliesin to whitestone  laura to vox machina  marisha to vox machina  matt you may raise your glass and drink if youd like ashley  ashley oh thanks  matt there we go laughs  marisha do that ben and jerrys pint  laughter  matt as you guys finish your drink the heroes feast slowly sinks back into the dirt leaving the  empty tunnel before you the slight cold sound of drifting wind through the now freshly barricaded  rock exit of the secret passageway /none/ begins to reach your ears what do you wish to do  travis do we want to check the wall  liam im taking point i want to check out that wall that i sat right in front of  sam lets all go down the tunnel  liam yep come on everyone  marisha i light up my hands for light  matt okay  laura very quietly down the tunnel  matt using the veritable torchlight from keyleths burning hands you guys press down the  hallway vax taking point eventually you get to the end of the /none/ hallway theres a portion of the  stone wall that has been chiseled out its not very smooth its rough in the way it was  constructed but there is definitely about a footthick wall that would go to the right and  left of you in the dirt that has been chiseled and broken through to reveal this passageway that you  guys are traversing  immediately on the other side of this opening now that you have a better look at it it looks to be  some sort of stone sculpture or statue of some kind  /none/ ashley sneezes  laura and matt bless you  matt you see what looks to be the back side of some armored soldier but its all carved from  some sort of marble at a closer look too percy you see its carved from the white stone that is  actually mined in this  taliesin do i recognize this part of the passage  matt you do this statue is one of the large things used to hide this exit and it is normally  shoved out of the way there are a few other boxes immediately adjacent to /none/ it and from what little  bit you can glance past it it looks like this section is used for storage of some kind and is  filled with whatever random crates and whatever needed to be placed down here to keep it out of  the way  travis can someone check to make sure that its just a statue  marisha can i do an arcana check to see  matt sure  marisha if its magical magic trap  liam im going to perception it 20 on perception  marisha natural 20 making up for those fucking /none/ ones  matt there you go as you step up and inspect the back of the statue the stonework is very well  done and there is a very very faint magical essence to this statue its so miniscule and the  only reason youre able to pick it up is youre so finetuned to seeking out that presence it  doesnt have a specific form it doesnt have a specific school of magic applied to it it just  has a general faint magical aura  marisha is it carved out of the rock  matt its carved out /none/ of the white stone  marisha got you but its not magically trapped  matt correct it doesnt appear to have any sort of strong magical presence for a specific purpose  marisha and if we touch it were not going to be possessed or something  matt you dont think so  marisha i dont think so  liam i silently signal to everyone and i slowly stealth around the statue to check out the room  matt okay its all pressed against the wall the widest gap is about that wide youre going to  have to push /none/ or shove things out of the way all the crates are pushed up against it blocking the  whole exit  laura is it too big for you do you need maybe somebody stronger  liam i reach out past my sister and pat him on the shoulder  travis yes  laura whispering i think youre up  travis where up where  laura i think you need to move the fucking statue  travis oh  laura quietly  travis whispering oh and i gently start to push the statue out of the way  matt make a /none/ strength check  laura oh no really  travis thats a one  matt natural one  marisha im sorry  matt grog cracks his fingers and grins stepping up goes to push the statue and then pop  something in your lower back gives and groans  liam peacock a little more for us please  matt the air escapes your lungs and its been a long time since this injury has crept up but you  threw your back out a little  travis i slide down and go you know im so tired of groans taking all /none/ the glory why dont  you guys  laura trinket trinket tries to  matt trinket who at this point in time by the way guys takes up a large portion of the  tunnel  laura yeah he wants to get the fuck out of here  matt pushes past you guys and turns around and puts his rump against it and starts backing up  into it moans go ahead and roll a d20  taliesin please defeat this door  marisha fucking doors  liam whispering can you please fix grogs back  taliesin doors of whitestone /none/  laura doors of fucking whitestone oh god  matt add two to the roll  laura only two  matt yeah  laura i dont add his full strength it doesnt fucking matter because i rolled a three  marisha doors  matt laughing perpetually defeated by passageways and entrances  taliesin curse you doors  sam ive got this guys  liam wait before we use listen this could potentially be humiliating for all of us before  we expend any of our arcane abilities please let us all at least try and fail before you take out /none/  the hand  taliesin lets all push  laura as much as we can  sam wait why are we pushing this thing  liam lets do the one and a half elf push shall we you you and me  laura and percy  taliesin ill join  sam i will push as well  liam all the averageshaped people  laura im rolling my giant foam dice for this  matt all right everyone but grog can help in this grog youre out for this one  sam im helping  marisha hes helping  sam i /none/ am not helping  marisha ooh i rolled a 19  liam one eight  sam 11  marisha wait is this just a strength check  matt yeah adding your strength  marisha straight strength  laura one  marisha 21  taliesin 12  marisha grunts  matt as you give it a good solid try the force of you guys combined there is just a lot of  weight pressed up against this statue with the crates on the other side this storage room is  very full and you find vox machina for all of its /none/ journeys battles victories and celebratory  events bested by a room of clutter pike did you want to give it a shot  ashley yeah  marisha i turn around and im still pushing  sam wait pikes going to do this  matt okay pike roll a d20 and add your strength modifier  liam come on pike  sam doors man  marisha charge at it  laura this is like the lid of a jar everybodys loosened it up and pikes going to  sam what  ashley 19  matt plus your strength modifier  ashley /none/ i rolled an 18 and my strength modifier is one  matt all right as you guys all take a moment to have this discussion pike steps forward her hair  drifting behind her buoyant in the air  liam somebody draw it please draw it  matt she steps up and centers herself sets her shield to the side puts her mace down closes her  eyes puts her hands on the statue and just grunts begins to shove and push as she does  you guys hear stone scraping noise  laura seriously  taliesin i could have /none/ done that  matt the crates begin to push and move out of the way and she pushes the statue a good six feet  ahead pushing some of it out of the way leaving a little bit of opening and a visual walkway into  this basement area  laura look at that  marisha it must be nice to have the strength of sarenrae  laura pike you saved the day again  sam mrs shorthalt you are amazing  ashley whoa scanlan  taliesin well fine  matt trinket gives a grumpy grunt  sam pike will /none/ you carry me over the threshold  laughter  liam wait i fistbump pike pop my hood up and then quietly go into the room  laura not yet  liam yeah im the best person to do this  travis can i have trinket step on my lower back please  laura trinkets really good at that  matt trinket is really good at massages trinket begins going grunts stepping on you cracking  and you hear  travis groans thank god  matt im going to have you roll a stealth check  liam 29 for stealth  /dung/ matt with disadvantage  liam disadvantage  matt because of grogs moaning at the massage  liam thats fine that balances out and my first roll was a 29 total  matt laughs okay all right you disappear in its very dark in here theres one sconce that  appears to be giving a bit of flickering light across the way as you step out of this chamber  into what looks to be two paths that go to the right and the left and then curve and disappear  right across from you appears to be a central room /dung/ or space you can make a little bit of visual  around you but best you can see is there are a series of bars like cells arranged across some  of the walls here you appear to have stumbled upon the subterranean  whitestone dungeon or prison  liam can you help me understand the makeup of it again you said two passages one to the left  one to the right and a chamber directly ahead between them  matt correct  liam i know weve got two paths but he said theres a room as well  /none/ matt here this will be a good perspective for you  sam oh you just happen to have the room drawn  matt thats where you guys came through  liam yeah  matt and see this path here  laura yeah  matt and here and there are cells on this side  marisha is there anything good in the storage room that were in  matt oh youre in the storage room  marisha yeah  matt make an investigation check  laura yeah i start opening up crates  matt okay  marisha thats not great eight /none/  matt theres a lot of broken building materials  laura 18  matt 18 okay looking around you see theres work materials theres pickaxes theres  crowbars theres things that are used in various toolbased means throughout the uses of a castle  most of them are for grounds repair and things like that nothing particularly interests you  there are a few crates that have residual whitestone in them but it appears that most of it  has been used or taken elsewhere  laura like whitestone dust  matt like dust and small rocks here and there /none/  laura can i gather some up in a bag  matt sure  marisha yeah i pick up a few pieces too  matt okay you seeing both of those paths  liam so both paths and theres a room closer to me right  matt yeah around the way to your left you see thats the source of a little bit of sconce  torchlight  liam all right into my little earring i say whispers im not doing anything fucking  crazy im just going to go ahead this is the only thing i can do and /none/ i move quietly into the  close chamber  matt okay as youre moving forward you hear behind you the sound of crates shifting lids  moving because searching through a room of large clutter and crates makes noise you take a few  steps and that happens and youre like and you hear echoing from around a corner a voice go  hello is someone there this really crackly dry voice  liam i stop moving entirely and i just wait  matt hello  laughter  matt silence  liam and can i hear anything besides that theres /none/ nothing else i hear  besides that in this room  matt from what you can tell no  liam theres no dim light or anything  matt the only dim light is coming from around that corner from the source of where that sound  seemed to come  liam okay i should be able to see then if theres dim light up to 60 feet  matt right nothing immediately in your visual perspective if you go all the way to the edge you  can look past the corner if you want  liam okay i slowly /none/ back up away from that and creep up the hall and stop at the corner before it  turns and i just lean my head out and i listen  matt okay perception check  liam 27  matt okay listening for a second you hear what sounds like some shifting like a body shifting  over some sort of low crumbling sounds almost like grasses or hay or some sort of soft bedding  is being shifted a little bit you hear a clink of metal of some kind youre not sure quite what the  source is and /dung/ a couple of other small shifting and grinding sounds of metal comes to a halt  liam got it so i tiptoe all the way back to everybody and say listen stop doing that  stop theres two passageways up the way i think were in some sort of dungeon  taliesin i could probably confirm this  matt very much so this is where you woke up where cassandra pulled you  taliesin this is absolutely the dungeon  liam i had surmised as much theres possibly an old person in one and then sounds of something  so /none/ both of the chambers are occupied i came back to confer with you instead of going off on my own  because that gets me in trouble  laura hey thank you so much  liam one time only  sam lets go talk to the old prisoner  liam what do you want to do  marisha are we sure theyre prisoners  liam do you want to talk to the possibly old person with the crazy eyes thing  travis shouldnt we ask percy what he wants to do  matt you right now are staring off into /none/ space because you recall the last time you were here you  woke up in a cell next to a cell that contained a pile of bodies of previously related members of  your family before cassandra ushered you out  taliesin i would like to start making my way in that direction  matt okay so as you guys are having this conversation percy just starts walking  liam percy you probably want to take out one of those contraptions of yours  laura wait before he goes i cast pass without a trace on everyone  matt okay /none/ everyone who wishes to be stealthy can be stealthy  liam im rolling along with percival  taliesin im being stealthy  matt okay everyone roll stealth  ashley me too im super stealthy  matt well keep with your consistent roll currently  sam 15  matt okay with plus ten  sam thats with plus ten  liam its 30 this time  matt all right  marisha 21  laura add ten because i cast pass without a trace  taliesin 21  liam oh 40 this time only with her  matt only it would be /dung/ like whoosh whatd you get grog  travis 26  matt okay you guys all move as a group forward pike whatd you get yeah roll your stealth  girl plus ten to it  ashley laughs i have three  laura but plus ten  liam can i give her seven of mine  matt no you guys push down the left hallway or the right one  taliesin im heading towards whichever cell had been mine  matt the cell that wouldve been yours would be kind of on the opposite side of the room from you  /none/ on the other side the fastest way would be taking the left path towards the light source  taliesin the left path  matt okay so you guys head that direction kind of following percy  sam thats not the direction of the voice  laura yes it is  sam oh it is  matt yeah you move towards the light you guys turn around the corner and look not in the cell  you were in but across the way because there are six cells three on each side of the hallway  facing each other and on /none/ the far cell on the outsidewall side of it you see theres a torch  sconce that is lit and just slowly crackling its almost reached ember period like its about to be  changed out probably and inside you see sitting just squat on the ground in a cell by herself  this woman facing away back up against the bars and thats all you can see  liam drawing a blade just in case  laura as i approach i put my finger over my mouth and look at her can she see us  liam looking away /none/  matt shes facing away from you guys her back is up against the bars shes kinda  sam psst oi hello  taliesin shh  matt turns her head and looks over and its the first time you see her face much older woman  probably in her early seventies or so but seventies living in a not very seventy years in  a hard life so very deep sunken wrinkles the skin is very weathered her hair is mostly  whitishgray with a little bit of you can see remaining reds and browns in it at some point /none/ she  mightve had much
