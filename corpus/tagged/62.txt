none	 dramatic music  cheering  critical role theme music  cheering  moderator hey  matt hi  moderator so that was cool  marisha ive never seen it so big thats  what she said oh thats so great  matt after 4 pm  marisha after 4 pm  moderator all right guys this is the panel youve all been waiting for it is about a little  show called critical role have you heard of it  cheering  moderator some of you have heard of it thats good thats cool joining us two of the stars 
dung	  and the dungeon master himself mr matthew mercer and the lovely marisha ray  marisha and joining me is this glass of shiraz yay shiraz  matt biggest cheer  moderator were going to start dive right into it there is going to be time at the end for you  guys to ask your questions so figure them out in your head hold onto them so do you guys  remember your first ever dd character  marisha i do  moderator tell us about it  marisha my first ever dd character was actually with this guy 
dung	 he was my first dungeon master  once you go matt mercer  laughter  matt sure ill allow it  marisha i had never played before because i grew up in a small town in kentucky where dungeons   dragons was a ritual cult or something  matt and marisha its the devil  marisha i came out to los angeles and he ran a oneshot for me and i made a controller ranger  it was fourth edition and she was a ranger that would cast control spells  matt i think it was a drow too 
none	  marisha she was a drow yeah drow ranger controller caster it was cool i had bats i had  a lot of bats i would make aoes filled with bats thats what i remember  matt and marisha bats  matt my first character was less cool id been brought into a second edition dd game in high  school theyre like play whatever you want im like i want to be a wizard i want to be a  gandalf wizard who uses his sword how can i do that well theres this militant wizard kit oh  
none	 cool ill use that as such i made a wizard that wasnt as good at magic and was really terrible  with a sword he didnt last very long his name was ameridus trent named after the xanth  character and it was a terrible terrible character but you learn from your mistakes to  this day he has a special place in my heart to not make a wizard that uses swords  laughter  moderator we all know critical role for what it has become now but where did it start what was  the first thing that 
none	 brought this show to us  matt before it was a show it was just our home game for a little over two years id been running  different campaigns for years off and on and liam obrien loved dd when he was a kid but  hadnt played in many many years  id been threatening all through the time we were working on resident evil together saying  hey man you want to play dd let me know finally as part of a birthday celebration he was  like all right go ahead and run a game well 
dung	 bring some people over thats where we brought  taliesin in dragged laura travis and sam who had never ever played before most of the players  who came in had never played so we began running a home game from that oneshot and it turned into  a campaign that was ongoing  marisha i actually didnt play that first game because no one else had played i was there as  assistant coach assistant to the dungeon master i went around and would help the characters  i basically just pointed to their stat sheets whenever they were 
none	 confused on what to roll  moderator can you come to my place and just do that i mean that  marisha just pointing over peoples shoulders wheres my damage right there  matt you were essentially microsoft words clippy of dd  marisha i was totally clippy  matt it looks like you have a strength bonus right there  marisha dont forget your advantage  matt exactly we played on our own for two years and then word got around in the industry about a  bunch of voice actors playing dd and people were like that sounds 
none	 pretty nerdy and we were  like damn right eventually felicia day contacted us through ashley johnson and she was  like hey you guys ever thought about making this into a show were like  matt and marisha no  matt that sounds like a terrible idea  marisha no one would watch that shit  matt yeah and then eventually we were like well well give it a shot and see if it  works out and were all here now that worked out  cheering  marisha we gave ourselves a promise that if we hated it 
none	 after six weeks and if it didnt take  off we would quit and go back to playing at home no harm no foul we arent losing anything  really needless to say that decision was not made which i am very glad it was not made  matt now we have cg video of sam shooting a lightning bolt out of his crotch thats fun  marisha its funny how things work out  moderator how has the game changed since when it was your home game to now being livestreamed to  over 20000 people at any given 
none	 minute  marisha not a whole lot part of our stipulation for making it a show is that we didnt want it to  change we were in preproduction for six to eight months with geek and sundry because they were in  the same camp that we were in where they thought theres no way anyones going want to to sit down  and watch people play dungeons  dragons for four hours they kept trying to make it more visual  one of the original ideas is that we would play to a certain point in the campaign 
none	 then we would  stop then we would all jump on computers into an mmo like world of warcraft and then beat the  boss in the mmo we were like you dont know how dungeons  dragons work that no luckily it  didnt go that way  matt we had a while figuring out how the show would work we decided we would leave it up there  blemishes and all all of its awkward stumbling and us messing with the rules essentially just  our game with cameras available and it worked  marisha the benefits are 
none	 one were not waiting in between games for six weeks we only have a  week so we can retain information a lot more since were on camera it cut away from the  sidetable chatter that you have in a lot of your games where if one persons distracted with  something youre like hey bro hows work going  matt oh it sucks my car broke down last weekend i was supposed to get it fixed oh and im  rolling initiative  marisha wait what happened it cut down on a lot of that which was good 
none	 if anything were  almost more engaged  moderator thats cool obviously you guys didnt expect it to be the runaway success that it has  become your fans are incredible i mean they create fanart they cosplay theyre so engaged  whats it like for you guys especially seeing someonei know matt you used to be a  cosplayerseeing someone dressed up in costume as the characters you guys are creating whats that  like for you  matt i dont know whats going on its crazy were all crazy so awesome i its seriously  marisha there are 
none	 no words i dont know man  matt if i told you how many times weve read the response letters weve gotten from fans and the  heartfelt emails and breaking down into tears with the idea that people out there are either so  touched by our silly little game or have gone on and made their own home games and sent us pictures  of their friends getting together on weekends and playing and how much its affected their life and  changed their life that theyve created their own worlds thats really the most i could have 
none	 ever  hoped to create with this show with all of us  marisha its forever overwhelming and well say repeatedly that critical role is not just the  show when we say critical role were not talking about the stream that airs from seven to ten on  thursday nights were talking about the fan art and about the community because if it wasnt for  the fan art we wouldnt have visuals the fan art really does add so much more to the show  matt when we say fan art that includes like we have a lot 
none	 of wonderful musicians that write songs  and music based on their inspiration from the show we have wonderful writers that write a lot  of really awesome fan fiction side stories within the world they create on their own  marisha its all so good its all so good  matt all these people find different crafts and different things that theyre good at and find a  way to take the inspiration and funnel it that way and create something really cool and unique were  constantly beside ourselves and dont know how we ever got so lucky 
none	 to be even remotely involved in  this wonderful chaos  moderator can i get a show of hands if youve ever made critical role fan art or cosplay or  written something or engaged with the critical role community  marisha see look at how many  moderator thats crazy  marisha it accounts for 50 of what we are for sure were always so humbled not to go keyleth  on everybody here for a minute but were not heroes were not special were just people and  matt you totally went keyleth  marisha i did but 
none	 were not were not just to have anybody to say that weve moved them or  affected them its like im going to stop talking about it so i dont start crying on  stage  moderator just drink  marisha i drink  moderator matt a question i think every dm in the room wants to know is how do you prepare for  a session how do you get that ready whats the process  matt it changes based on the story elements and whats happening but i generally try and foresee  possible directions the party may 
none	 go based on what happened in the last game ill consider those  paths maybe theyll go and this one story lead i left them a while back theyll pursue that in  this direction so ill flesh out this path and whatever npcs they may come across and possible  encounters they may circumvent or go head on into and ill prepare that from multiple different  avenues i dont flesh it out too crazy because most of that is going to go out the window the  moment you play anyway because inevitably players do the most random 
none	 shit ever and you have no  control anymore  marisha cows  cheering  marisha proudest moment  matt i usually break it down in a word document and ill have bullet points with major important  points of information like if an npc knows certain key elements of a conversation they try to  draw out ill have notes on what they know and what the players could find out if they ask the  right questions its pretty loose so i dont feel like i put too much effort to have something  never come to light 
none	 if it doesnt get used and if it does happen a lot of the conversation is still  improvised and i use those bullet points as points of reference as they emerge  marisha a lot of people ask for your improved npcs give a quick list of your improved  unexpected npcs victor victor wasnt expected  matt theres a lot of them  marisha kynan wasnt expected right no wait kynan was  matt kynan i prepared a little bit theres a lot of them  marisha theres so many that you werent expecting  matt i mean 
none	 technically theres too many to list right now  marisha never mind  matt you caught me off guard with that one there are a lot of ones that are improvised when they  first happened but i then fleshed them out once they were created too so its hard to remember  which ones started that way unless i go through a list to consider it its okay put me on the  spot its fine deep voice matthew mercer  will remember this  laughter  marisha shut up telltale shut up  moderator whats the most unexpected 
none	 curveball that the players have thrown you  matt cows was pretty crazy  moderator someone has to fill me in on the cows thing  matt long story short they were briefly given a task to help this farming community outside of the  main city who had been losing livestock they had just gone missing and there had been rumors of  some large creature snatching them away in the middle of the night the party decides to go and  infiltrate this cattle field by masquerading as cows through illusion magic and then try  and interrogate 
none	 the cows for information  laughter  matt cows even if you can speak to them through magic means arent the best conversationalists  nor really take in the information around them she talks to one of the cows and was like so  what have you seen and the cow is like  marisha and matt grass  marisha big bird  matt pooping not a lot going on inside the cows head then suddenly this giant bird a roc  comes swooping in and snatches one of the players up thinking its one of the cows and takes 
none	 off  into the night the rest of them to give chase have to use a fly spell now all of a sudden you  have this giant squadron of flying cows coasting over the night sky after this giant bird and thus  the fan art rolled in after the evening of this wonderful moment that was definitely a strange  curveball  marisha i think the hashtag vox moochina started happening after that  matt yeah there was a whole sequence where they went to the temple of the raven queen to retrieve  this artifact and the 
none	 artifact in the end was trapped after this big battle with the beholder  everyone was like oh thank god that was cool lets go see what loot there is no one  checked for traps taliesin scared for percy grabs it sets it off avoids it himself but it  hits lauras character she fails her saving throw and it kills her outright shes just dead and  so they end up trying to resurrect her and they go through the ritual and as part of the ritual  liams character who is her twin brother basically prays to 
none	 the raven queen in an angry way  saying take me instead of her and unknowing started this path of joining in a pact with the  raven queen none of that was planned none of this was expected and now suddenly this entire  characters story is completely changed based on this one improvised character moment and its  pretty much defined his story  marisha based on this one fuck up  matt yeah this one bad roll that laura made completely altered the trajectory of this  characters story  marisha i remember we were all so 
none	 angry at ourselves after that because we were like man  that was some level one mistakes right there cant believe we did that and everyone wonders  why were so paranoid high pitched voice god why are you guys taking so long to talk about  these plans crying voice because people die this is real life go with it  moderator now that i think were getting pretty deep into the fandom i think i can ask this  question this is one of the many many questions submitted on twitter and this one is if gilmore  
none	 owned a business present day what would it be and would it be a dance club  laughter  matt i think one of his many business in modernday would probably be a delightful dance  club that hell id frequent that dance club  marisha id go there hell yeah  matt gilmores glorious dance floor yeah  marisha gilmores glorious grooves  matt there it is dance music noises oh yeah  marisha dance music noises  matt gilmore voice thats right shake that money maker  marisha dance music noises  matt yeah other than that he 
none	 would probably buy out the mens warehouse and make it so much more  fabulous gilmore voice think business suits everything would be rhinestones and glitter it  would be marvelous  marisha youre going to like the way you look i guarantee it  matt gilmore voice im going to like the way you look  laughter  matt gilmore voice everyones going to like the way you look trust me i know what im talking  about  moderator okay so now that weve all experienced that bringing it back a little bit tell us more  about 
none	 your background in tabletop gaming where did it all start for you and what encouraged this  love of gaming  marisha i briefly mentioned it before but he was my first dm and then that was just a oneshot  and then i was hooked from there on out i think i had an adrenaline high for like the rest of the  evening after that game and then from there on out i sought out my own games and then i ended up  doing a buffy the vampire tabletop rpg for a while which was great a 
dung	 few other shorter  campaigns little one shots and then came back around for the game before this one which was  with you and yeah  matt taliesin  marisha taliesin and a few other people that was our long running game for about a year well  marisha and matt for two years  marisha then from there jumped into this game thats a deeper question for you  matt i started way back before there was time and deserts in the ancient dark days of 1997  marisha sharp inhale  no audio  marisha sharp inhale 
dung	  laughing  marisha thats it  matt okay i was waiting for more yeah so i was in high school i was invited to be part of a  game i was excited i made a terrible swordwielding wizard we talked about we played  for a few months and i realized very quickly that the dungeon master that was running the game was  really frustrating and was playing more for his own personal empowerment and power trip type  circumstance than trying to tell a good story and a narrative and so i got frustrated and stopped 
dung	  playing that game and started dungeon mastering my own that was where my real path of game running  started ive played in many games since and with many good friends i still talk to and occasionally  game with to this day but that was definitely where it all started  moderator thats awesome a good dd group is hard to get right as you mentioned certain dms  can be super controlling and some people just arent great in a team  matt i think a lot of that also stems from communication before you start playing 
none	 too  sometimes if the people arent clear about what kind of game its going to be when you get into  it you start discovering until its too late that everyone had different ideas and expectations  of it but i think that can be avoided for the most part if that communication actually happens  but it still happens its hard to avoid  moderator my question was going to be do you have any advice for anyone who might be starting  their first game  matt if youre starting your first game where you havent played 
none	 before its okay to be nervous  i still am before every game we play regardless you learn over time to go ahead and let go and get  into the story and have fun it doesnt mean you have to do crazy voices like we do or insane  people thats what we do for a living you find your comfort zone and if someone is new to your  game and theyre being a little shy let them be give them opportunities and try to elevate them  and give them the spotlight occasionally if you have that 
none	 one player in your game that usually  takes the spotlight and stands up and overshadows the rest perhaps talk to them and let them calm  down a little bit and let somebody else step in and be in that light as well if youre just  starting definitely take the time to build a character personality that you would be  comfortable playing for an extended period of time it could be something thats opposite from  you if youre a meek person you can try pick someone who is more strong and bombastic in the  hopes 
none	 that maybe that will help pull you out of that shell a little bit conversely you can pick  someone who is comfortable first as well just make sure that when you have a character that  youve developed you have a clear enough idea of how to play it so that when the opportunity  arises you dont feel for lack of a better term  marisha trapped  matt maybe you lack the drive and the will to step out and make those character moments happen  a lot of dd is give and take in an improv 
none	 environment with the other players and if you  have a lot of experienced people around you its hard to find a place to jump in other people are  used to seizing the moment and if you wait too long youll miss that opportunity that comes with  experience dont be afraid to leap out and take a moment to say something to shake the story up  and show the rest of the party that you have something to offer beyond just additional damage  in the occasional combat circumstance  marisha i think to go off of 
none	 that point know that the game wont wait for you so if you want  to say something you have to make it be known i mean theres been a few times im sure you guys  have all noticed most of them when something might happen and one of us will have an idea or  want to try to say something and then a moment will come in and take it off in another direction  and then its gone but you have to let it go once again its just like life that happens  sometimes but 
none	 if you want to say something you jump on it immediately i actually get asked a lot  from my fellow ladies any advice for women who want to jump into the genre and a lot of them are  very intimidated because it seems very maledominated thats such a tough layered  question to answer in so many ways i mean in two ways one we look out in this audience like  half of them are women first off represent yeah ladies game hell yeah i feel like thats  slowly coming out of that trend  secondly 
none	 i then want to address all of our boys out there all of our men because there  is a little bit of onus on you to realize that it can be intimidating if youre a woman trying to  come into this so if you are at a gaming store and a woman joins your group just be welcoming  realize that thats not necessarily easy to do and it does take a lot of balls to walk in there and  just be open and accepting i think so much about dd is about being open and accepting 
none	 because you  dont want to sit down at a table where you feel like youre going to be judged you know  matt on that point and this is my last other note point to make on this if you do feel theres  conflict theres something in the game thats bothering you as a player if you play for a few  games and its not clicking or a player is acting in a way that you feel is preventing you from  really enjoying the experience dont be afraid to talk to them about it after the 
dung	 game i wouldnt  say throw down in the middle of the roleplaying game session because it just tends to lead to  heightened emotions and conflict but talk to the dungeon master afterward or talk to that player or  both and just be like hey just wanted to ask the way this is going im not really feeling like  its letting me play my character or the story is really hindering me from enjoying this is there a  way that we can work towards changing or making it better for all of us together and most 
none	 people  will be happy to they just werent aware that there was a conflict of that type of circumstance  and if they arent willing to maybe find another gaming group yeah those are my biggest  suggestions  moderator super helpful so i know that youre all bursting to ask your questions wonder woman  is our roving mic tonight which is just a really fun thing to say so put your hand up if you do  have a question and wonder woman might choose you  matt come on wonder woman  marisha i choo choo 
none	 choose you  matt pick the person im going to get my water  audience member australian accent some great npc character voices any chance of an australian  one  laughter  matt when i get comfortable enough with the dialect to not embarrass myself in front of all of  you yes  laughter  matt as a performer im always working on different dialects and accents and the australian  is one that ive only in recent years been really trying to take a crack at and im not quite  comfortable enough yet to go all 
none	 in with a character in that regard  marisha we try not to be offensive  laughter  marisha try emphasis on try  matt and if i do it and it sounds awful its only because its a fantasy world where there arent  actually australians its its own unique dialect that might loosely at times sound australian but  its my world whatever  laughter  wonder woman weve got another one over here  audience member hi matt ive got a question about foreshadowing storybooks and villain  progression so i want to know without giving too 
none	 much spoilers away and i wont mind if you  choose not to answer this but back in the prestream when the group fought brimscythe was  there anything they would have encountered that would have stopped thordak from returning  laughter  matt i mean there were things that were happening during that time period parallel to  their progression in the story that they could have totally mucked up what eventually became the  releasing of thordak but that would have been a very very far arc out of the path they were  taking and they didnt 
none	 have the necessary magical ability at the time nor the really clear knowhow  or knowledge to know to pursue that thread as far as they knew brimscythe was a singular entity and  what brief hint they had of the rest of the chroma conclave with the other obsidian spheres in his  lair it was more like a oh thats not good lets not go there ever again slowly step out and  lets say that never happened  marisha yeah basically there were evil eyeballs in a bunch of crystal orbs and they were like  we 
none	 saw what you just did and were coming for you and were like well thats ominous well  anyway moving on we have no context for that and kind of just kept going  laughter  marisha i think we all had that moment when we were like this is going to come back to haunt us  moving on time for the winters crest festival you guys high five yeah  matt they had more pressing matters at the time  so it may have been possible but it would have been  a very very extraneous long shot 
dung	 to discover all the story elements and even so the entities that  were involved would have probably sneezed and killed them all like raishan who was partially  responsible for that would have just turned and gone laughs thats adorable  acid breath sound and theyre all dead  marisha that bitch is mine that bitch is mine that bitch is mine  raishan  wonder woman weve got another question over here  audience member hey guys huge fan i watch all of your videos all the time and one of the videos  that i watched was 
dung	 with vin diesel with the large witcher  marisha what whos that fake laugh  audience member i just want to ask you a question as a dm and a player myself was it  awkward or was it funny moments when youre trying to dm for vin diesel yourself  matt well first off that was one of the weirdest phone calls ive ever gotten in my life dan casey  from nerdist three days before it happened going hey matt so you want to come on monday and  dungeon master for vin diesel i was like haha 
none	 what  laughter  matt lifes weird enough in la that with conversations like that there is always the chance  of truth even if someones messing with you i was like erm what what do you mean yeah  totally all right cool so how long are we going to play hes like how about two hours of game  play time im like ill prepare about two hours of story itll be great they build the  whole set over the weekend i show up monday i get a call the morning up dan caseys like hey  
none	 so vin diesels time is cut a little short so we can only play for an hour im like okay so i  had to condense two hours of story that i had into an hour we can do this we can do this  marisha and then they were like oh yeah by the way we actually want to do a pr qa with vin  diesel for like the last 20 minutes so you really only have about 40 minutes  matt and marisha which they then cut down to 25  matt so i had to condense 
none	 two hours of story to 25 minutes no pressure but at the same time when  you have someone on that level of multi international stardom like vin diesel it feels  like an 80 to 90 percent chance theyre going to be a complete asshole its just how it works  sometimes so i was really worried i was really worried and he showed up and we finally got a  chance to talk and we went over the story and his character for about ten 15 minutes and he was  the coolest chillest dude ever  marisha 
none	 he was so nervous  matt he was like im so excited i havent played in a while and i hope i do okay i like the  idea of the character okay cool we can do that oh man im really excited thanks for having me  on he was a very very cool guy i was super excited he was a little rusty at first and as you  watch the video you see him he kind of has to get into it it takes him a few minutes but as soon  as he rolls that first 
none	 natural 20 he turns into a big eight year old and hes like yeah critical  that was when i knew we had him i was like we got this  marisha jesus  matt you were just talking into your wine werent you  laughter  marisha shut up i wasnt no i wasnt no i wasnt  matt you were talking into your wine  marisha no that wouldnt happen in front of a bunch of people  matt so marisha what was the next question  marisha shut the fuck up  laughter  matt here talk 
none	 into the mic  laughter  matt im so glad we were all here to witness that  cheering  matt yes  marisha that was the most la thing ive ever done i dont know what i was going to say its  not important anymore  wonder woman would you like me to move on to the next question  matt yeah yeah to answer your question it was intimidating but ultimately a lot of fun  wonder woman weve just got another question here so  audience member hi guys this kind of ties in to the 
none	 whole making a character that youre  comfortable with how much of your personality goes into making your characters and for you  matt how much of your personality drives the stories you create  matt its hard not to put an element of your personality in every character you play because  theyre your character each represents a facet of your personality some that maybe dont get  explored as often or that you dont have the opportunity to even in evil campaigns you can  make a terrible character but is a part of your id thats in 
none	 that character you want to play the  story because you dont have the opportunity to express these darker elements of your persona so  this is your chance to do so so its hard not to put yourself into a character to a certain  extent  marisha i mean technically if we want to get all actory woowoo on you for a hot second the  stanislavski method actually works a little bit like this where you make a table or a t chart  and whenever you have a character you write down the ways you are 
none	 like that character and all the  ways you are not alike that character and the way stanislavski teaches it is in the ways that you  are similar awesome you dont have to act and its not a bad system because i could be a mile  apart from someone sitting next to me but youre still going to have something in common everyone  has something in common somewhere  matt as far as creating stories and world and npcs in the same way its hard not to put a  little bit of yourself into them story 
dung	 is a little more esoteric im fascinated by things  that are not like me things that are different especially as a dungeon master where you play so  many characters part of the fun of that the thrill of that is being able to express so many  different things that are outside of your comfort zone  matt i really enjoy being able to step in and play female characters across the spectrum from  very powerful strong personalities to sly dark somewhat manipulative individuals as far as dudes  go i get to play a range of 
none	 dumb grizzled outback farmers to very intense politicians to  all these different things that are not at all like me except for little bits here and there  you find that seed of truth is what you build on each time but for making characters its hard  not to put a nugget of yourself in there really  wonder woman got another question over here  audience member so youve got a backstory you said youve written for both gilmore and allura  god forbid anything happens to them because we love them but would you post online 
none	 their  backstories for us to read  matt perhaps one day its one of those things where when youre developing a world of this  size and its a lot to develop a lot of expectation a lot of eyes on it i have to find a  fine line between revealing information thats already been revealed and things that are still  behind closed doors there are things that may and probably shouldnt be revealed because the  party wont know and if ive learned anything its that information online everyone is going to  tweet it at 
none	 my players i can be like this is a thing thats happening but dont tell the  players and then 12 hours later its like hey liam look at this thing and of course players  are going to look so i purposely keep a lot of things close to my chest because i want it to be a  surprise for the players and for the watchers  marisha yeah by the by if you tag us in the tweet it does mean we can see it  laughter  marisha not a lot of people understand that concept 
none	  matt oh my god i hate that episode i hate watching marisharays face like she sees that tweet  marisha and im like hey dude and hes like i didnt know i didnt know you hi hi i can  see that  matt big fan i love keyleth im sorry i didnt mean that dude its cool just dont put  me in the tweet  laughter  matt but yeah i think eventually when this arc finishes and things are revealed i probably do  and ive talked about this a little bit when vox machinas story 
tavern	 ends sad noise do a big qa  with all the things that people didnt know and the questions that i cant answer now because that  parts over ill be happy to discuss  marisha weve been planning as a group that whenever vox machinas story comes to the end we  want to have like at a tavern some drinks and its us talking to st peter at the pearly gates  being like all right dude so tell us this one time that the beholder did this thing and could i  have avoided it and you 
none	 just tell us all your secrets  matt i cant tell you all the secrets  marisha i want all the secrets  matt i cant tell you all the secrets  marisha all  matt cant cant tell you all the secrets  marisha yes  matt not happening  marisha okay moving on  laughter  wonder woman weve got another question over here  audience member in any game past or present do you have a favorite trick or cursed item  marisha im sorry what  wonder woman a favorite trick or cursed item  matt 
dung	 i mean craven edge was a fun one  laughter  matt not necessarily cursed but sentient weapons and sentient magical items are always an  interesting dynamic bringing another personality and source of strong power in a game that also can  decide whether or not it likes its wielder or can manipulate the wielder always makes for a fun  game thats a lot of fun less of a magical item but i like characters that can play with luck it  happened in our game these hags dark fey creatures could pluck elements of luck and fate 
none	  from players as part of a trade and i like that aspect of it while its not necessarily an item  that character now looms technically now vax is now indentured to one of those hags the trade  that he made for the poison that he has yet to use oh i remember everything guys i remember  everything  marisha he hasnt used that poison  matt nope  marisha what a dumbass  laughter  marisha hes going to die over that poison and hes not going to even use it  matt not my problem 
none	  marisha love you liam if you watch this later  laughter  wonder woman so weve got another question over here  audience member whats up guys so weve had a whole year of this happening so weve got great fan art  great fanfiction and stuff so that we know if this is being recorded whats the line of you  going hey this is great whoa back up i dont want that  marisha anything on rule 34  laughter  matt i will say im very open to all sorts of fanfiction fan art even racy 
none	 stuff we go to  burning man were cool whatever floats your boat its fine but when you stumble upon  extremely graphic sexual fan fiction about the players not the characters ill draw the line there  marisha i forgot about that yeah  matt and you know what power to you i guess but that at least that was a very awkward  morning i think taliesin read longer than anybody and he was like oh god oh god i  cant stop why no oh  marisha it became like a test of willpower to see how 
none	 long you could get through it i did what  with how many of us were in one what jesus  matt that was unique  marisha yeah that was extreme  matt and yet at the same time i guess achievement unlocked i dont know the saddest  little boop boop  moderator now everybody is going to try and find it now  matt we may have just horribly embarrassed some poor tumblr writer im so sorry if we did  marisha we love you just  matt youre great we love you and appreciate you it just 
none	 caught us off guard  marisha yeah  matt wasnt expecting that  wonder woman weve got another question if youd like  marisha yeah  laughter  audience member matthew merther merth uh  matt yes  marisha garbled noises  audience member matthew mercer im sure this has never happened to you youre such a great dm but  lets say you wake up one day 20 minutes to game  marisha where are you going with this  audience member there is a point  marisha im sorry this has never happened to me im so embarrassed 
none	 keep going  audience member 20 minutes to the game youve got nothing prepared what do you do  matt 20 minutes to the game and nothing prepared  audience member nothing prepared  matt write down a bunch of names and just see where it goes one of the things thatll hold you  up for any game situation wise is having to create npc names in my opinion and nothing will  take the players out of a deep fantasy story more than being like oh you encounter david the  knight or steve the stable master you 
dung	 know steves been in a lot of your guys games and mine  too steve gets around the table the rest of it you can bullshit as much as you want but having  that list of names is so helpful because can just say oh yeah you run into a halforc named  marisha pervan  matt purvan as a singular phrase  marisha pervan  laughter and cheers  matt thats an actual name and all the people out there whose name is purvan who watch the  show hate all of you now but i love you 
none	 purvan  wonder woman weve got another question up here unless you want to continue  matt just to finish up real fast once you have those names down the rest of it you can bullshit  all you want and make up whatever happens but that to me has always been what sells a story  youre making up or not is to have those names on the go for any npcs they encounter like that  monsters you can make up stats on the go if you want you just see how the dice roll and say  
none	 yeah that seems like that should hit or oops that missed or you find a crystal that  hums and whispers the phrase golden girls over and over again what does that mean lets find  out you can make up whatever you want but the names make it easier  marisha monday tuesday happy days whoa holy shit what is this stone  matt its a great module the happy days module highly recommend it  marisha what was the book we found in the store game empire and it was called gms gems or  something like that 
none	  matt yeah it was a cool book called gms gems that has just a bunch of resources for game  masters that has a bunch of tips and tricks on npc creation world building magical item  development and a bunch of examples you can pull from that as well  marisha yeah it had a list of names it had a list of npc quirky hooks like has one eye and an  eyepatch and has a limp you know so that you can just look quickly and be like this is an  interesting person that i 
none	 totally thought about  matt so if you have 20 minutes you can go there and be like uh all right theyre in a small  bog and they discover that giant rats have become sentient and have begun stealing children in the  night to mutate them into horned rat gods  marisha its like mad libs dd  wonder woman so weve got another question over here  matt yes  audience member gday guys one thing ive noticed with matt saying a lot of the telltale  things like matt will remember this what are the chances 
none	 of actually getting a critical role  telltale game and if it was in the works would it be a preseason one a postseason one or  would it follow an npc  matt i mean id love that that would be awesome i think when their licenses involve  minecraft and batman our lowly dd game isnt quite going to call their attention yet one can dream  marisha yeah i mean we know a lot of the telltale guys too but they yeah theyre doing  their own thing right now  matt between minecraft and batman and 
none	 the borderlands most of our party has worked with  some telltale to some degree but its also their interest if they came to us and wanted to make  one hell yeah hell yeah id be all over that so what im saying is you all should bombard  telltale to make a critical role game and just let them know that there is interest no dont do that  marisha dont do that  matt dont do that that can come across as a little  marisha lets just say there are things being worked on  matt 
none	 thats way too vague  marisha i cant say any more ndas and shit  matt we have no idea we would love one day to create something like that  marisha were working on it man  matt were trying to find ways to expand the media  marisha and i do want to preface all of this with when you guys watch critical role we are  pretty much 100 selfproduced we work with our producers at geek and sundry but they are also  producing everything else so were very selfrun so when you see the fanart 
none	 galleries in break  liam does that when we do the preshow announcements i do that thats all stuff we  wrangle we selfproduced our opening title video you know so its just us and were working as  fast as we can yeah  moderator i think weve got time for one more question  wonder woman weve actually been given a few moments more to ask some more questions  matt you dont say lovely  wonder woman you guys are special weve got a question here  matt question please  audience member i was just wondering 
none	 if you could do the gollum voice  marisha something about the gollum voice  wonder woman yeah just wondering if you could do the gollum voice  marisha go matt go  matt well liam can do it a lot better because he actually does gollum for the games but let me  see gollum voice it came to me my own my love my precious gollum gollum we wants it  gives it to us please no youre a thief a liar no no not listening not listening  murderer no go away there you go  cheers 
none	  wonder woman so weve got a question over here  matt pff i do not need your mic  laughter  audience member i was just wondering in vox machina a lot of their characters are  multiclassed for story purposes but keyleth is one of the characters i dont see multiclassing  so if you could what would you be and why  marisha if i multiclassed into anything so full disclosure i actually debated heavily about  multiclassing with keyleth for a hot second but i am a little torn because honestly im still kind of  
none	 going with the flow of the character none of us know whats going on were all riding by the seat  of our pants with this one so you guys know about as much of keyleths future as i do because were  allowing ourselves to be affected by the story elements so itd be stupid if i was like no i  mean this is going to be my future im going to have an oscar in five years you know like that  type of thing so we try not to do that because the world changes you 
none	 so i did debate for a hot  second when keyleth was very angry shes pulling out of her anger phase but when she was so upset  at the way that the world had become and that shed been lied to she felt like shed been lied  to so there was a hot second that i actually debated about throwing a point of barbarian into her  whoas surprise  marisha yeah  matt man raging and wild shape is no joke that is no joke  marisha so i thought about and ill tell you the moment 
none	 that i thought about it and it was  after the fire ashari had gotten wiped out and i levelled shortly after the fire ashari got wiped out  and then there was the few times at whitestone where i started using my fire storm  spell and i was describing it as very like keyleth is enraged shes enraged and angry and  shes crying and shes casting these fire spells so that was the moment after the fire ashari was  wiped out that i heavily debated it but it is tough because keyleths whole overarching journey  
none	 is to try and become archdruid and be the salvation to her people so yeah  wonder woman weve got another quick voice request over here  marisha dance monkey dance  matt dance monkey  marisha dance monkey  audience member about your character mccree whats the time  mic drop  laughing  no audio  marisha im just enjoying overwatch like a happy person  laughing  marisha pew pew pew pew  laughing  matt western intro noise mccree voice its high noon  marisha screaming  cheering  matt mccree voice someone call the undertaker 
none	  wonder woman now weve got our final question  audience member um hi  matt hi  audience member some of my marisha hey  marisha hi  audience member some of my favorite moments in critical role have been the character  interactions whether its between the player characters or between the npcs i think my  favorite to date is gilmore and keyleth teleporting to find a very naked vax  laughter  audience member and just that reaction  matt theres been a lot of player nudity in recent games its been a theme recently im 
none	  like okay all right  audience member i think everybody is okay with this  marisha hey body pride right be comfortable with yourself  matt theres nothing wrong with it  marisha no body shaming  matt no im not shaming anything i just  marisha free the nipple  cheering  matt its just a trend that started happening more often recently i was like huh all righty  anyway your question  marisha dragons are destroying the world you think we give a shit about seeing each others titties  matt no why are you yelling 
none	 at me i think its great i was just acknowledging it whats your question  audience member my question is is that something that that interaction between  yourselves between the player characters between the npcs is that something you actively try to  foster or is that something thats just kind of come about over the years as youve been playing  or is that something you kind of go oh i really want to go for these cute moments go for these  sad scary moments between all of you so its not just combat or is that 
none	 like oh its happened  this way this is great  matt i think its not so much that everyones trying to shoot for sad moments or happy moments  or levity were all performers and we all love story telling and narrative primarily thats our  career thats what drew us into it so while all players and myself enjoy the strategy and the  difficulty of battle thats a very big part of the game for us at the same time its as  important if not slightly more so is the narrative and the character interactions for 
none	 us  nobody really plans moments per se because no one knows whats going to happen even me i cant  tell you how many games ive prepared sheets and then we only get that far into it or we skip all  this and go right to here so i dont know what theyre going to do either i think all these  moments that you see are part of what makes the show so interesting for all you guys and us is  no one knows whats going to happen and all those moments happen organically  marisha 
none	 yeah youre experiencing it with us which i think like you said is why its so  engaging when there is a huge plot line reveal were reacting with you guys  matt yeah that kind of for us the thrill is for me knowing whats going to come dropping it  and seeing how the players react and take it and in many cases taking it in directions i dont  expect and thats really cool for me too so i dont think anyone plans specifically except for  maybe sam sam plays the long con i know hell 
none	 plan moments to happen a ways away and find a way  to drop it so if anyone hes the one that does plot on his own for a bit but other than that i  think most everyone else is playing pretty much reactionary to whatever is occurring in the game  and thats kind of thrilling  marisha yeah i think the only time that ive really like the gilmore thing that was totally  circumstantial that just worked out the way it worked out  marisha the only times that ive tried to think about moments and 
none	 conversations i want to have  generally theyre still a result of reaction theyre still a result of well this happened so  i know i want to have this conversation so like in last not last episode but the episode before  talking with pike i knew that keyleth wanted to talk to pike about the religion aspect before they  left and then keyleth and kima had butted heads early on and that was totally reactionary because  keyleth did not trust kima but after that keyleth felt a little bad so there were apologies  later that 
none	 was thought about but not necessarily much more beyond i know i want to apologize or  i know i want to talk to pike and thats kind of as far as we go  matt good question  wonder woman okay so we dont have any more questions left to ask them but do any of you guys  like singing by any chance  moderator do you guys know that theres a reason this weekend is special other than haven and  its matts birthday this weekend  cheers  moderator im sorry  wonder woman so im
