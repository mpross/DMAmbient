dung	 hello my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor and dungeon master for geek  sundrys  critical role and welcome to my fun little video series about tips and tricks for game masters and  dungeon masters today were talking about social noncombat encounters  trumpet fanfare  i guess first well start with that not all battles are fought with weapons i think combats  great its a lot of fun but theres a lot to be had in many games about social combat and the  dynamics in how you deal with nonplayer characters and either 
none	 political or intense social settings  first and foremost creative ways you can incorporate these in your game social events like  balls or council meetings or diplomatic missions or consider spy games if youre playing  a heavy intriguetype rpg interrogations investigations these are all things that are  challenges and encounters in their own right theres just not hit points involved and tohit modifiers  one thing you want to consider when youre deciding what kind of noncombat social encounter  it is what is the overall goal of the social encounter be very clear with the players 
none	 what  theyre supposed to be trying to achieve as part of this encounter otherwise it can tend to  meander a bit and get confusing so long as there are npcs that put them on this mission or the  circumstances that lead them to this encounter is very clear as to what the goal is that helps the  players number one feel more comfortable in the environment two when they converse with  npcs and try and pry information or discover secrets they know what exactly what to look for  and what not to say and 
none	 three it helps your preparation be a little more direct so you dont  end up having to be a little too lost amongst 300 nonplayer characters you werent expecting to use  but on that note too you want definitely want to make sure that the npcs are involved in these  encounters are pretty well fleshed out you understand them you know what their goals their  perspectives their needs their fears are and what theyre looking to get out of this and what  they dont want to be found so definitely flesh them out to a 
none	 degree where you feel comfortable  getting into a conversation with the player characters  keep a list of key information that each npc may know that pertains to this circumstance and mark  which npcs are willing or unwilling to share this information some may want to sell the information  at the right price some might need less soft methods to get it out of them but definitely keep  note of how important this information is to each npc  and how willing they are to give it up also if  there are different factions involved 
none	 in this social encounter make sure you note which npcs  are involved with which faction or which guild or whichever various political circles are involved  in this encounter as well it could be especially if its a large gathering of different political  avenues those always go well those dont get weird or awkward at all and that will allow you to  draw those lines socially and the players can play sides if they want to or play them against each  other its kind of cool you may even have players choose a side or choose 
none	 multiple sides if  theyre very careful and arent discovered as a double or triple or quadruple agent that always  ends well if hollywood has taught me anything  another thing to consider raising the stakes if youre in a party and youre just talking getting  information and you leave we got the information yay thats fine but thats kind of  stagnant and stays kind of level find moments or points in the story where you can up the ante and  raise the tension things like imagine an npc that you thought was dead suddenly shows 
none	 up and  you cant go and attack them immediately because youre in the middle of a very very tense social  environment or envision how someone whos at the party who had the info youre looking for suddenly  disappears and theyre found dead in one of the nearby rooms without a murder weapon and now it  turns into a classic whodunit which is always fun no matter what genre or time period youre playing  also consider how can these events and outcomes affect the world at large these little  conversations may have a very big 
dung	 impact on the how the story and combat outside and for the rest  of the story may happen and occur so dont be afraid to think of the longreaching repercussions  of how the players act in this environment stolen objects work well finding a hidden spy is always  cool someone whos using information against the party that you discover and once again you have  to find that fine line between sneaking off and doing dirty dark stuff in a hallway and then have  to act nice james bondstyle in the middle of the environment thats 
none	 always a fun dynamic  also there are other things you can incorporate in this that are noncombat based encounters not  just social encounters but noncombat things like an infiltration like a theft trying to  steal something or an important object from a museum that in itself may lead to battle and  many of these may still lead to battle but it doesnt have to thats a series of skill checks  challenges you can put traps and dangers in the way it can feel as tense and as cool as battle  without having to actually 
none	 do battle also things like running a gauntlet or having a contest of  skill that the player has to go ahead and prove themselves to a certain faction those are cool  challenges and encounters that dont necessarily involve combat or a mat or miniatures but you can  still build the same tension and the same stakes in those as well  but do keep in mind and be ready for it many social and noncombat encounters can very quickly  become combat encounters if player actions have taught me anything in previous games you should  know 
none	 what i mean when you create one of these definitely have in your back pocket some idea of  how combat would work if a fight were to break and who would be involved just to be prepared  because its probably going to happen  anyway thank you so much for watching i hope this has been somewhat helpful or useful for your  gming and dming pleasure you can check out more episodes of this on geekandsundrycom i guess  ill see you guys soon one way or the other
