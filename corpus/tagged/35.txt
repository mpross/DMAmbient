none	 dive in here to the proper part of tonights episode of critical role  taliesin opening credits  dramatic music  matt welcome back so we had a week off last week where the amazing liam obrien there ran a  oneshot game of absolute chaos and did an amazing job  laura it was pretty fun  matt if you guys havent had an opportunity to check it out you should its up on  geekandsundrycom its amazing and made me and marisha very jealous that we couldnt play it but  we were here in spirit and obviously 
none	 motorcycle and sidecar so that was fun well show you some  of the fanart  but anyway back to this game vox machina the group of adventurers who had found their way now  seeking the vestiges of divergence ancient artifacts of power to help them in their struggle  against the chroma conclave the collection of chromatic dragons that have razed the entire  countryside of taldorei theyve acquired a few of them but the most recent one sends them to the  feywild in search of fenthras a bow which seems to have acquired the eyes of 
none	 vex upon it  you took care of some business managed to ward off an assassination attempt by a rakshasa and  found your way through keyleths plane shift spell into the feywild somewhere in the vicinity of the  portal where the nymph in the frostweald upon meeting vox machina years before supposedly lives  laura oh shit grog  ashley time to get some tail i was going to say something else and then i realized not sure  where that came from  matt so to bring us back in as you step out into the temperate 
none	 air youre struck by the vibrant  purples blues and pinks of sunset that envelop the skies and the clouds above the tree line the  smell of fresh morning dew and poppy upon the breeze fills your head and your feet wade through  tall thick grasses that tickle your knees with each step vinecovered tree trunks rise all  around you curling as they stretch upward like a bending dreamscape and hundreds of small bobbing  faerie lights glow in the shadowed distance of the forest looking about you you can see what appear  to be clusters 
none	 of mud and small pools of water that are scattered in your vicinity some ten 15  even 30 feet apart small little pools that dot the landscape almost like pebbles scattered across  a small field what do you guys want to do  laura already  sam where are we  marisha its beautiful  travis i feel like we got drugged  taliesin this is fantastic  travis is anyone else seeing the colors and the shapes and the  taliesin oh its everything i could have hoped for  marisha i want to live here its 
none	 amazing okay  laura well i have no idea how to get our bearings here unfortunately  taliesin well is there any sign of any bit of civilization or construction  matt make a perception check  taliesin oh lord  travis first roll of the day dont fuck it up  taliesin ah yay 26  matt 26 okay as you guys are taking in the vicinity percy glancing around you see no signs  of civilization the only thing that catches your eye is a little ways past the immediate tree line  that meets your eye the 
none	 fairy lights seem to be caressing the outside of some sort of older stone  structure and thats about as much as you can make out looks about four or five feet tall and  its only barely visible between two of the trunks  taliesin i think i see a thing im heading in that direction  marisha oh i want to go see a thing i want to go i take off after percy  travis we can always let them go first and they die and then we go  laura perhaps it might be wise to 
none	 move quietly  taliesin we are already going  laura brilliant  liam you remember what our teachers said of this place its pretty but its dangerous  laura its very dangerous and im afraid they dont understand  marisha guys look theyre fireflies  taliesin wait dont touch dont touch were going to head towards the stone  matt okay you make your way across these extremely thick mosscovered tree trunks you  push past the two and eventually come upon the structure and as you get closer the fairy lights  dim and vanish as soon as you 
none	 get within five or six feet of them and they seem to only appear at  a peripheral point you guys approach the stone structure  liam do vex and i have memories of these from our tutoring in elftown  matt not particularly nothing about it strikes you as part of the general feywild lore there are  structures that have been built throughout periods of time some of which have fallen to ruin nature  in the feywild tends to reclaim things that arent natural if left to their own devices  liam but the lights we never 
none	 heard anything about those lights  laura whispering willowisps  liam well liam knows that but im asking if vax does  matt i would say have both of you guys roll history checks for the both of you vex and vax  taliesin can i add into that too  matt you would not  taliesin i learned elven i was a bit of a nerd  matt you learned elven but elven culture and the feywild are two entirely different things  taliesin oh yeah im aware my heads full of bullshit too  laura 20  liam 
none	 just a 13  matt 13 okay best that you can ascertain the first worry initially and you have encountered  something like this before willowisps entities that were the lost souls of individuals  that died under tragic circumstances in swamps and bogs and in heavily wooded areas however those  entities are usually larger and are drawn towards sources of life the fact that these are much  smaller and tend to fade at your arrival means either theyre not willowisps at all or a  different kind you havent encountered thats as much information that you can 
none	 deal with  liam i wonder if theyre fairy folk  laura maybe  taliesin now dont touch well stay 11 paces away  marisha okay  matt id like you both to make stealth checks if you could  marisha okay  matt anybody else going up with them or is just the two of them  travis oh fuck those pieces of bait  laura can i climb a tree close by  matt make an athletics check  laura athletics can i use my acrobatics to hop up ooh swing myself parkour  matt roll athletics with 
none	 disadvantage just because im giving you a chance  laura acrobatics with disadvantage  matt yes  laura 24  matt okay this is the one time youve bartered with the dm this session  laura oh no i shouldve saved it  matt you do manage to leap across because these trees are thickly wooded and the branch line  starts at about the fourfoot mark anyway its fairly easy for you to leap up the top of the tree  without an issue you vanish up into the canopy you two whatd you roll for stealth  marisha 
none	 a 20  taliesin and a 12  matt and liam whatd you get  liam i didnt roll anything i just wanted to call out you couldnt have used the broom for that  laura laughs nope  taliesin and were keeping about 11 feet so at least  matt 11 feet okay you approach this stone structure which you see now is the corner part of  a wall it looks like there was some sort of a small structure here best that you can make out  all of its heavily covered with vine and ivy and 
none	 all the places where the stonework is broken looks  to be through natural erosion or claimed by actual roots and you can see now part of the tree roots  have actually risen up and tore down elements of these walls and you can see broken rubble barely  poking through the very thick underbrush of this forest whatever was here was built a long time  ago and has been mostly reclaimed by the forest  taliesin inner corner or outer corner  matt the corner is facing you guys so youre on the outside of where the 
none	 structure would have been  marisha its a ruin or are there walls that continue on  matt this is a ruin but most of its been torn down and its not visible sections of walls  available the largest piece is currently the corner youre facing  marisha interesting  taliesin go ahead im going to sit and quietly sketch for a moment im taking everything down  marisha can i do a check to see if i can recognize who mightve built this stone structure  matt make a history check  marisha ten  matt you have 
dung	 no idea the planes youve studied are the planes of the elemental form the feywild  is a little ways outside of your realm of any training or storytime youve been given growing  up most of what youve gleaned about it thus far has been based on the conversations youve had in  recent weeks  travis are there a lot of pastel colors all over the place  matt it ranges from at least in this forest a very deep lush dark green like a heavy winters pine  green the forests are more vinewrapped mossy willowish trees 
none	 that hang down  travis okay so not crazy lsd colors going  matt no however the evening sky is very purple and orange like around a very bright dusk and  that colorscape does contrast with the green of the forest quite beautifully  travis is it dusk  matt it looks to be getting to dusk yeah  taliesin it may or may not be  travis what does that mean  laura time is different in the feywild  taliesin so theres no carvings that i can see on this outer wall nothing  matt not from 
none	 ten feet away no  taliesin and the vines that are climbing on it are they flowering anything at all  matt the vines that are there do have small whitish flower buds little flowers that have been  blooming in a small scale across the vines  marisha do they look like anything that we have on our plane  matt not particularly they look like white flowers from this distance youd have to get  closer to inspect directly  marisha can i do that  matt sure  taliesin be very careful nothing here is exactly what 
none	 it appears to be  marisha i wont touch it im going to its so pretty  liam vexahlia  laura what yes  liam do you want to go higher and get a birds eye view maybe thats not safe but  laura thats why im staying in the trees brother  liam i meant even higher  laura i will if it looks safe  liam all right  laura does it look safe  matt the canopy is very thick and only in these small little patches of meadow like the one that  you entered and 
none	 had all the little pools in it and the one that youre entering now which has the  ruin have little breaks in the canopy where you can actually see the sky otherwise its very  thick so actually flying through the canopy unless youre going very slowly is going to be  whipping you and probably knocking you off  laura can i see from my height can i see a better view of the ruins and everything  matt you can make your way up there a little bit make a perception check keyleth you approach the  
none	 ruin to get a closer look at the plants make a nature check  laura oh and this is forest right  taliesin and marisha oh  marisha 30  matt okay these white flowers resemble a form of daisy that exists in taldorei however they grow  there in flower clusters out of the ground youve never seen them sprout from a vine and the  shapes a little different and you dont actually know this form of plant from your personal  experience but you can ascertain a similar nature to it  travis nothing is what it 
none	 seems  marisha a feysy are they poisonous or anything like that  matt they dont appear to be toxic no  marisha can i touch it  matt as you reach out and touch it with your finger i need you to go ahead and do nothing  because its fine  laura you sneaky here we go  travis as you always means doom  laura i got 25 on my perception  matt okay as you rocket up past the boughs and begin to emerge from the edge of the canopy over  this opening you do 
none	 see a very large water pool on the other side of this ruin you can see where  this ruin used to be most of it has fallen and then sunken into what appears to be a very glassy  pool of water a still surface untouched theres no wind in this area its a perfectly reflective  surface to the opening above it  laura do i see any life forms around  matt you dont see any life forms you do see a bare minimum hint of movement if you will  beneath the water you cant make 
none	 out the shape but you do see something moving beneath the water  laura does this look similar to the pool that was on the other side of the portal  matt its a pool  laura i wouldnt know  matt it looks like water and youve seen a number that youve come past in this way this  ones larger than the others  marisha i want to pick the little white flower  taliesin oh i wouldnt do that  laura i come down and i watch as keyleth makes a stupid move dont pick anything  
none	 matt you pluck the flower as you pluck it the vines begin to writhe and pull away from the  stone actually releasing the hold on the ruin and as it does you hear what sounds like some  movement some shifting of water on the other side of the stone wall  laura there was something in the water on the other side of the ruins  marisha i take the flower and i put it back  matt the vine has retracted and as you set it towards the vine it tumbles off and actually the  flower 
none	 you see now as you reach down it has turned from a beautiful white and has immediately  withered into a black dried husk  travis wow weve been here five minutes  marisha i was going to press it and keep it  laura im not lying we should probably hide  matt where was once silence you hear the rushing of leaves as the canopys beginning to close over  like the trees are leaning in and the actual branches themselves are starting to close up the  gap in space on the sky  liam im going 
none	 stealth ducking into the grass  matt stealth check on both you guys  sam im hanging back with grog ive been scratching my back on his knee for a while  travis i dont see what the big deal is really  laura 29  matt okay  liam 34  matt okay both of you guys you go back into the branch and you can feel the branches pushing  behind you and you have to actually get low to not be dragged away with the rest of these  extending branches that are closing off the opening 
none	 in the canopy vax you make your way  towards one of the tree trunks and dart out of the way percy youre watching this in horror  taliesin im trying to very gently back her up  matt okay its at this point you guys see a hand creep up over the stone a secondary hand  marisha maybe its his version of a doorbell you pick a plant and you get  matt pulling up from here you now see what appears to be a humanoid female form lithe hair  wet and slicked back and as the 
none	 head peeks over  taliesin i bow and i push her down  matt okay the moment there is any movement she flickers and moves back from the wall looking  already very perturbed by this whole circumstance i need both of you guys to make constitution  saving throws  marisha oh not bad 21  taliesin natural one  matt natural one as youre shoved ahead and begin to go into a bow percy you bow but you  cant take your eyes off of it as the creature pulls herself up over the wall an extremely  
dung	 beautiful impossibly beautiful woman nude steps up over the edge of the wall and as you glance  forward everything goes dark blackness  marisha is he still conscious  matt you bow and he appears to be bowing hes still standing hes fine  taliesin hello  matt as soon as you say that the creature darts backward and you see it take a few steps and then  leap and dives into the pool and vanishes beneath the waters surface although you see that  keyleth percy you do not you just hear footsteps  taliesin oh dear 
none	  laura what happened  taliesin were going to have to find her  laura did she say anything  taliesin no  marisha she was very pretty are you okay  taliesin i think she blinded me no she blinded me  matt and you look at percy eyes wide open glancing about the pupils moving about  taliesin yes im blinded im blind  marisha okay  travis really  sam we should test it out  travis yeah how many fingers am i holding up  taliesin one  laughter  travis hes a liar he can 
none	 see fine piece of shit  laura grog did you recognize that woman  matt were you paying attention  travis no  laughter  laura you didnt see the naked woman come up over that wall  travis where hold on did you hear that  sam if there was a naked woman i would have seen it  taliesin im going to curl up in a little ball for a minute and rock  matt okay percy crawls onto the ground and begins rocking back and forth  laura i come down out of the tree can you 
none	 just be quiet for two seconds  marisha maybe itll wear off in a minute  laura shushing grog  travis what  laura there was a naked woman in a pool  sam go on  laura that reminded me of maybe the pool on the other side we were jumping over from close to  that portal right could it be the nymph that you stole the heart of  marisha she was very pretty  travis i dont know maybe  laura would it be safe for you to see her again and maybe ask for her 
none	 to cure our friend here or  would you is she dangerous to be around  travis well she didnt blind me  laura whatd she do to you  travis thats none of your business  laura well i worry if we go try to talk to her if its not her then she could blind all of us  travis i dont know my chick didnt blind me so if she did i think we need to kill her  taliesin im going to take out my dragonslayer longsword and stand up and start using it as a 
none	  cane find my way to grog and poke him with it  matt okay make a perception check  taliesin better thats 18  matt okay as theyre having this conversation you  taliesin just a tap  matt you find your way over and sure enough no person has the leg density that grog does and  youre pretty sure you have your mark  taliesin going to give it a good little whack oh im sorry its so hard to see  travis im sorry i need to be more sensitive look out its a parrot and 
none	 i kick the sword  marisha a parrot  travis yeah there are rabid parrots out here in the feywild  sam he kicked the sword  travis oh you know what just go pick it up  laughter  travis let me get it for you ill hold onto it since youre obviously useless now i go pick up  the dragonslayer longsword  liam i walk over to percival percival im worried youre going to walk your glasses into a  tree or something do you want one of us to hold those for the time being  
none	 taliesin ill take them off and put them in my pocket  liam do you have something to put them inside of besides just the pocket i dont want you falling on them  taliesin no ive got a thing itll be all right  laura percival would you like something to hold onto as you walk  taliesin actually if you dont mind can i borrow a bear yes  laura yes of course i pop trinket out  matt okay trinket whoosh bear noises  laura hi buddy  matt jowls shake as you rub your fingers into 
none	 his fur  laura trinket were in a very weird place a weird place things can happen  marisha and i whisper to trinket dont crush the flowers  taliesin im willing to try and make this work for a moment  laura trinket can you help percival walk hes blind  liam matt pike is with us right  matt no  liam no okay  laura shes back in whitestone  liam all right i robot out once in a while on skype i guess i missed that  matt thats okay all right so you feel the 
dung	 somewhat damp cold nose of a bear nudge under  your hand and then bear noises and a shoulder lunges into you  laura now dont walk him into any trees trinket dear  taliesin do you mind im going to try and hop on top im going to make a leap to get on top of the bear  matt okay it takes you a little while but you get up onto the bear eventually you have to right  him because hes facing the wrong direction a little  travis all right so wait can we be clear 
none	 you picked a flower all the trees got pissed off you  went blind some naked chick jumped a wall and thats the story of whats happened so far we are  killing it right now  laura dont touch anything  travis i feel like maybe we need a change in leadership just saying  marisha there are very large consequences for picking flowers  sam all right which way did she go  laura she jumped over the wall here  sam should we follow  travis yeah vax can you get a pair of eyes on her 
none	 without going blind  liam i dont feel confident about that  laura i can try  taliesin which direction was this pool  laura its right past the ruins right there darling cant you see grog do you want to give  it a go  travis what go look for her  laura just go see if its her  travis all right fuck it  laura be quiet okay  travis no and i do a full vault over the wall  matt you land feet go squelch into the muddy outskirts of the pond its about 
none	 up to your  ankles but you can see the water is now rippled and disturbed  travis can i stick my fingers in the mud does it smell weird  matt smells like probably the freshest poolside mud youve ever come across  travis i wipe it across my chest do i see any footprints from where naked chick went  matt no none  travis what  laura she went in the water grog  travis she left no traces  laura she was in the water before  travis does anyone want to come with me to 
none	 the water  laura ill come with you to the water  taliesin ill go with you  travis youre not going anywhere  taliesin trinket  marisha ill go get your eyes back okay  travis all right i cautiously make my way down how far is the water can i see it from where i am now  matt yeah its about maybe ten feet from you  travis all right ill stealthily make my way ten feet towards it  matt roll a stealth check  travis son of a bitch  matt you put it in 
none	 the descriptor man  travis i did 17  matt okay squelching you make your way as markedly quiet as you can  marisha im going to sit on the wall and watch for a second  matt okay you come up to the edge of the water and you can see some of the ripples are starting  to lap across the mud the mud and silt continues downward into a perfectly clear pool though the  light source has been cut off from the sky now as the canopy has closed and what little bit of  light 
dung	 happens to find its way through the forest ceiling other than that its pretty dark  however you do have darkvision a few of you do have darkvision so its not a huge hindrance  within a certain distance you do see what appears to be clouds of silt on the bottom of the water  that have slowly found their way close to resting  travis can i call out hello  nothing  matt no immediate response no  travis can i reach in the bag of holding and grab a basilisk egg and can i try to 
none	 launch it as far  as i can into the pool  matt yeah go ahead and make a strength check  liam im going to scramble up next to keyleth to watch this  matt okay  travis 23  matt 23 you lob the egg with perfect accuracy directly into the center of the pool it hits and  floats on the surface semibuoyant with a little bit of the shell revealed on the top a few  moments pass before a few fingers curl up and grab it and pull it down below  travis oh i 
none	 saw a hand  sam did you recognize the hand  travis no im not like ray charles i cant tell if someones attractive just by their hands  marisha grog do you know how to float do you know how to float on top of water  travis yeah  marisha you should do that  travis you want me to put my body in there  marisha right dont we want to talk to her  travis what if theres more than one her  liam it went really well for you the last time that this happened 
none	  marisha yeah i figured it went well for you the last time youre the only one whos done this  before  travis yeah but there were these invisible steps right i feel like we walked up some steps  and then there was a portal and she came out first it wasnt like i went to her apartment and  i was like hey want to hook up  laura hey does this look like the pool you came into on the other side  travis does this look like the pool i came into on the other 
none	 side  matt make an intelligence check  laughter  travis 11  matt you were distracted for the brief time you spent over here but it does appear to be  similar  travis similar  laura remember her name  travis no did she have a name her name was nymph  sam why dont you call out her name  travis o nymph where thee art thou  matt make a persuasion check  travis oh shit seven  matt you watch as suddenly theres a burst of bubbles under the surface of the water  laura 
none	 scanlan whisper to grog what to say to draw a lady out youre very charismatic and  repeat what you hear scanlan say  travis okay well youve got to come closer though  laura use your earring  travis oh yeah we got earrings  marisha and ashley cyrano de bergerac  ashley cyrano that shit  sam o nymph hear my call  travis o nymph hear my ball  sam nope call  travis call  sam once we spent an afternoon together  travis once we spent an afternoon together  sam the sun never shone 
none	 brighter  travis the sun never shone brighter  sam the clouds were never quite as fluffy  travis the clouds were never quite as fluffy  sam oh it would make me a man again to see you once more  travis oh that was too much  sam and travis oh it would make me a man again to see you once more i have a small dick  matt another burst of bubbles comes up on the surface as the water begins to break and you can  see a very beautiful watercovered nude female form that 
none	 is laughing uproariously in the pool  laughs oh it has been some time  gasping  sam its her  matt and she takes her hair off to the side and gets the water out of it and shoves it over her  shoulder she steps up and this time her feet touch the surface and she walks on it like its  solid as she begins to step carefully towards you i apologize for being well and she  points over towards him i would recommend in the future perhaps a more respectful means of arrival  marisha 
none	 stage whisper sorry  matt if i recall your name was grog is that correct  travis thats right my lady forgive me your beauty has wiped my mind your name was  matt nala  travis nala i shant forget again  matt i watch over this glade it is bound to me as i am to it i would hope that in the future  youd be more gentle with that that resides here  marisha sorry im a huge fan is all hi im keyleth by the way of the air ashari  matt as youre talking 
none	 at this moment theres a sudden sparking sound like a heavy log has fallen  in a forest with a crack and a thoom theres a flash of light and she instinctively turns and then dives beneath  the water once more as you guys glance over theres a somewhat shimmering form of light that  congeals into a small gnomish female flickering in and out as pike after coming back from your  goodbyes and walking to the temple of pelor now constructed to take at least a moment to begin  building a bastion for sarenrae worship here 
none	 as well you miss your friends so hard in that moment  that for a brief moment the divine energies give you one last brief moment to walk beside them  across the planes  laura pike its been five fucking minutes  ashley dont we have a gatestone im sorry i didnt want to stay  sam is it because i owe you two gold  ashley yes  sam okay here it is  ashley okay bye  travis buddy  ashley hi buddy  travis what the fuck did you just do  laura you missed the

tavern	 you she looks out and looks towards you i remember  you as well  ashley hi i remember you stammering i didnt mean to startle you i didnt know everyone was in  the middle of something  sam whispering she fucked her too  matt she met all of you guys  marisha oh right for a hot second but then she took grog  sam of course we remember that thing that happened when we were drunk two and a half years ago  laughter  ashley i do apologize again for startling you  matt its 
none	 all right not many things happen in this glade these days so when they happen  rapidly it tends to drop my heart a bit speaking of which do you still carry my heart with you grog  travis as you know my lady of course i do  matt she turns her head i dont sense it on your person  travis oh right an actual no i dont we needed it for something yeah so when last i saw  you i had this horrible bunk in my chest it was terrible and in combination with your heart 
none	 i  was able to remove it and prolong my life which means im here  matt glad youre safe i shall begin the process of creating a new one then im glad it served you well  travis it did thank you many many thanks and you have our apologies again for beheading one of  your flowers and for making all the loud snapping noises this is not the way we wanted to start  believe me  matt she puts her hand up and nods  marisha i druidcraft a taldorei daisy and give it back to 
none	 i didnt mean to hurt your flowers  matt she nods and laughs she brings her arm up and as she does a singular vine seems to grow up  out of the muck and curl up and take the daisy from your finger and drag it off into the forest  marisha sorry  travis if i might ask old bleachyhair over here took a look at your beauty and all of a sudden  went raspberry and cant see anything  matt thats a hard lesson learned  marisha can you not get it back  travis nope 
none	 hes blind forever  matt it doesnt work that way im sorry  laura how does it work  matt for the most part those that fall under my protective gaze theyve earned it dont consider  past that and my innate talents do not reach beyond that striking so im sorry  travis yeah totally cool were going to put some braille on your gun  laura i bet pike has a few tricks up her sleeve  ashley i think i could give it a go with some things  marisha do you have regeneration on you today 
none	  ashley quietly yeah  taliesin i think its probably mystical  marisha i could attempt a dispel magic first  sam maybe youre just this way now and your other senses will get better  marisha you could rock it for a while  travis you said its been very calm around here  matt yes  travis no unexpected visitors or commotions lately  matt not around my glade no id know  travis may i introduce to you vexhalia  matt weve met yes  travis yeah thats right i forget shes seeking something in this place 
none	  laura yes actually we all are have you heard tale of a sick tree something very cancerous on  the land  matt there are trees that fall under various states of corruption time and time again in the  feywild light and darkness stands eternal here  laura this one holds a bow at its heart  marisha its located in a bog  laura in a bog something about glass  marisha near the river of the gilded run  matt the shademirk bog  marisha the shademirk bog thats the one  mat that is roughly 
none	 two days duskward from here  sam duskward thats west  taliesin or what passes for west  laura i just started a page on the feywild and now its already there it is  travis nala im sorry im very simple is duskward actually west  matt duskward is towards the dusk she points as she puts her finger up you can see the trees  relax now and open up the sky above you and you can see the direction where most of the setting  sunlight is being cast into the sky and she motions in that 
none	 direction  travis are you controlling the way the trees move  matt this is my glade we are one  travis yes its very impressive  marisha man can you teach people how to do that because thats awesome  sam well be moving on before then  marisha you know what ill talk to you later about it  sam have you heard anything of this bow or this tree  matt i have not i stay here this is my home and i am bound to it to not wander too far what i  know of 
none	 the shademirk i only know through individuals who passed through and kept me up to  speed with things that may or may not be transpiring in this landscape but those meetings  are tens of years if not more between  laura wow  liam im sorry have there been any significant changes of late cities here that didnt exist but  a while ago  matt not to my knowledge no my understanding of realms beyond this wood and beyond this glade  are fairly limited beyond what ive been given by passersby and its been not since 
none	 you grog  stepped through with me ive not had another cross my path  laura sounds lonely  matt it is my life the trees keep me company the roots they speak the earth itself is  sustenance and the voice the timeless voice of this land well there are many stories here  travis shes so sweet  marisha i really like her yeah  travis as we make our way towards this area is there anything that you would warn us of  matt everything  travis oh everything  taliesin like dont pick the flowers  
none	 sam is there anything specifically we should avoid specific plants colors  travis hands in the pocket policy going forward  matt gauge with care that which you tamper many things lie and live in these lands that could be  of aid and many your own destruction words spoken by many who live and call the feywild their  home are in themselves riddles deceit is their common form of time passage and those that wander  from beyond well some would consider you more of a toy or a plaything than a visitor or passerby  travis before 
none	 we leave is there anything we might bring you on our way back through here  should we be successful  matt laughs bring me some books  travis books  matt id like some books  travis my kind of books pictures  matt pictures are always nice but things to tell me of things beyond my sphere perhaps the  world you come from beyond the frostweald i know very little as well  laura i have a book on me would you like it  matt take whatever you wish to say goodbye with  laura well 
none	 i basically have it memorized at this point ive read it so many times  matt she takes it and thumbs through  laura thatll be 30 gold  laughter  liam 35  laura 50 gold  travis markups a bitch  matt closes it thank you  laura thank you  sam before we set out youve told us what to be wary of everything is there anyone out there we  can trust if come across them  matt depends on what you seek and what your reasons are trust goes all ways the difficulty  is 
none	 finding who is aligned with your ideals your intentions and your goals and who isnt i trust  practically no one sorry  taliesin im sorry were you talking to me  sam shes talking to you  laura what were those little colored lights that disappear as we get close  matt oh feyspecks they are small entities that care to the underbrush of the forests here  theyre not dangerous  laura do they lead you anywhere  matt im sure they lead you many places though none of them may be where youre trying to go i 
none	  wouldnt trust them to guide you they themselves are very deceptive and trickeryloving entities  but they help me keep the glade in the forest  laura i was wondering if you have any sort of youre very wellversed with this area any form  of protection you could offer us or recommend to us as we move forward in this confusing land  liam any last bit of advice  matt make a persuasion roll  laura 26  matt she thinks for a moment holding the tome under her arm well i have minor magical  capabilities 
none	 perhaps i could harden the physicality of one of you in a way to aid it  wont last long but its something  marisha any assistance is more than greatly appreciated  laura maybe grog  travis no i definitely dont need it im good whos all tender  sam percy at this point  laura oh well thats true  sam how many of us can you embolden  taliesin im a bit useless at the moment  sam no dont sell yourself short youre great  taliesin you know i know what youre doing right now  
dung	 matt she steps forward and as youre having this conversation she puts her fingers towards the  front of your forehead and touches your skin you feel a surge of warmth through your body though  blackness still takes your vision the rest of you watch as his skin suddenly turns to a dark brown  and crackles for a brief moment you fear but notice its like his physical form all parts of  the pinky flesh of the human percy become hard like tree bark  laura oh thats attractive  travis you got wood  laura hows 
none	 it feel  marisha i sniff percy  matt its like a fine cedar  marisha its nice it suits you its very masculine its a musk  taliesin thank you im still angry with you but thank you  sam grog carve your name in him  travis yes oh my god holy shit  taliesin i put the pistol slowly in the direction of his voice my lady i do appreciate your gift  and i do apologize for my friend and for startling you earlier it is my deepest regret that i cannot  take in the 
none	 majesty of your realm for the moment  laura laughter of your realm  matt well keep your wits about you thats the finest defense you have against this uncertain  landscape  travis it was a true joy seeing you again well try to bring ourselves by this way on our way out  as we can  matt i appreciate that it is good to see your faces as brief as it is  travis well wish us luck  matt good luck and safe travels  ashley bye nala  marisha as we walk away i give 
none	 percy a wet willie  travis i bow to her before i leave  laura yeah we do that too  taliesin does she go for the wet willie  marisha no i give you a wet willie  taliesin are you trying to give me a wet willie i use missile snare  travis pointedly i bow before we leave  marisha its not a ranged attack  matt so you bow she turns around and begins to walk back down the invisible steps you see her  taking as she drifts deeper into the water and actually before 
none	 she disappears beneath the  surface looks over her shoulder and smiles at you grog and then disappears beneath the water  below  laura be honest you totally tongue click  travis what  laura did you  travis i what whats wrong with your mouth  laura did you get it on with her  liam copulation grog she means did you do the thing  travis population no theres no population in that i think its just her in that  laura all right  liam did she like the beard though  laura oh thats right 
none	 you didnt have a beard before  matt as you guys are having this conversation theres a brief sound as percy even amongst his  blinded state catches keyleths finger in midair  marisha i still dont say thats a ranged attack  travis gross while the children play i make my way towards the dusk direction  laura toward the shademirk  liam wait hold on i believe i was standing next to keyleth so i stick my pinky into my mouth and  i shove it into percys ear  marisha wet willie is happening  matt all 
none	 right flanked by wet willies percy one is halted but in the distracted moment and  the stealthy rogue being what he is you feel the slimy insertion of a single halfelven digit into  your ear canal  liam and i say keyleth that is really immature really what is the matter with you and i walk off  taliesin still angry at you  ashley we should fix you  marisha consider that payback  laughter  travis is there any rocks or debris or little pebbles around on the ground  matt yeah theres plenty of stone 
none	 debris  travis ill take a small pebble pike you really should do what you can to help percy  ashley all right  travis and i toss the pebble at his face  laughter  taliesin missile snare with disadvantage  matt make a perception check  taliesin okay  marisha see that is a ranged attack  taliesin 26  matt he catches the pebble out of the air  taliesin my kungfu is far stronger than yours  sam all right pike do your thing  laura i dont know if he needs it  taliesin i 
none	 have dreamed about coming here since i was a little child im going to see this  ashley okay  liam wait lets all think about this for a moment dont do anything hasty  stage whisper everybody lets back up slowly  matt it gets really quiet suddenly percy  taliesin im on a bear  matt yes trinket stops and bear noises  laura stage whisper its okay trinket  sam stage whisper pike if you do this thing that youre going to do will it take away his  barkskin too  ashley i dont know thats 
none	 why im a little nervous  laura well you know thats how it goes  marisha you know and to be fair barkskin its all right  travis maybe its temporary  marisha barkskin is temporary  travis no i mean the blind part  marisha oh the blindness i dont know  taliesin youre all wearing your earrings its dangerous as it is but  liam its clearly hilarious but percival is our sharpshooter i dont know if we want him  laura he is one of our sharpshooters thank you very much  liam well why would we 
none	 want one when we could have two  travis lets try it then  ashley yeah a blind sharpshooter might not be the best in the feywild i would throw it out there  taliesin be a shame if your broom breaks  laura it really would hey i want to heal you all right  marisha do you want to be healed or not percy jeez first you say youre mad at me and then you  ensnare my melee wet willie  sam people were tearing ourselves apart in the feywild  taliesin im just reminding the dear 
none	 what side her bread is buttered on  sam let pike get rid of this blind spot so we can all be together again  travis its masterful  laura how long has he been working on that  taliesin wow okay  liam critical role where you come for high fantasy  laura give it a go  marisha wait percy  taliesin what  marisha say youre not mad at me anymore say hey i know ive done things in the past to piss  you off  laura trinket come here  matt all of a sudden 
none	 trinket lurches forward and starts dragging him  taliesin am i a reckless human  marisha yes  taliesin so when i say you shouldnt probably touch anything theres probably a really good  reason right  marisha yeah are you going to hold this one against me because i picked a flower like how you  held the clasp against me  matt trinkets been dragging him away from you towards her  marisha hold against me like the clasp  sam do you need inspiration pike  ashley no i think its okay  taliesin ill have my 
none	 revenge but i love you  marisha its okay  ashley get my way up trinket and cast greater restoration  matt okay so as you clutch your holy symbol your flickering divine form drifts over towards  the side of trinket you reach up and touch his leg and the warmth of the divine energy surges  through his leg you can see it almost like a sparkle up his chest little light rays peering  out from beneath the clothing it comes up his gullet up the side of his face and his eyes  flash white with 
none	 beams of gentle sunlight shooting out for a second the darkness becomes  blurry and your vision over the next 15 or so seconds returns to normal  taliesin oh  ashley you see  taliesin yes much better hi its so good to see you  ashley does he still have barkskin  matt yes  laura yay  marisha i come up from behind and give him another wet willie  taliesin yelps  marisha see i got you even when you had your eyes  taliesin ill make you a deal  marisha all right what  
none	 taliesin come here  marisha what  laura can we start moving forward yeah we leave them  marisha all right well keep moving  matt you guys catch up with the rest of the party whos now moved on ahead making your way  through this thick forest i would like you all to make a perception check  sam perception check  laura perception check  travis nice 19 natural 19  laura 27  taliesin 11  marisha 25  sam oh ten  ashley 14  matt what did you get liam  liam 24  
none	 matt 24 okay 25s or higher which i think is keyleth and vex you guys push through the forest  for about another two hours or so  marisha while we do that i take percys barkskin and i regal it out i give him moss  epaulets grow some flowers on it give him a little whitestone flower crown im making him a  fancy tree  liam a druidic sergeant pepper  taliesin now were even good  matt all right two hours of travel towards the direction of the dusk keeping tabs on it the best  
none	 you can you being the tracker you are you notice that the night hasnt come the light in the sky  itself has not changed the dusk hasnt waxed or waned theres been no change in the sky light or  color whatsoever the dusk seems to have for the last couple hours been perpetual and unmoving  taliesin maybe were in the dusklands  laura i feel like i remember hearing that the time here is very strange  marisha it stays at a constant correct  taliesin well not necessarily  laura maybe it moves slower here i 
none	 dont know  marisha we are moving towards dusk correct were moving towards the setting sun  matt youre moving towards that that was the one direction you were given by the nymph yes  taliesin it could be that we are either stuck in a loop or that we simply in an area of the feywild  that is eternal dusk  laura does it feel like were moving forward  marisha she said it was two days travel  sam two dusks travel  taliesin so we have to pass a dusk at least  sam that could 
none	 be years  taliesin it could  laura do you think its safe if i fly up and look at the sky  taliesin no but you might as well nothings safe  marisha do i see any birds or anything like that in the sky any wildlife any critters  matt make a perception check  ashley any critters  laura and taliesin critters everywhere  marisha sorry 21 yes 21  matt yeah okay you glance up at the next opening you have in the canopy and you see  occasionally a flock of birds go flying by 
none	 there is definitely vibrant wildlife and youve seen  throughout the forest here skittering squirrels and other creatures that live here though  themselves being skittish and running off as soon as your footfalls begin to hit that portion of the  forest there is a very vibrant critter lifestyle here within this part of the feywild  laura im going to try flying up all right im going to try flying up above the canopy  matt okay you come up above the canopy have to maneuver around some of the larger branches and  these trees are tall 
none	 you probably get yourself a hundred feet up before you finally break the  canopy and as you coast over the top you can see now before you this forest is vast the majority  of it behind you and you can actually see what appears to be the edge of the forests line maybe  about ten miles up and past that you can see rolling grass hills before a mountain  line you can see in the distance a very far distance make a perception check  laura im assuming im not in the forest anymore right  
none	 matt this would be looking beyond the forest so yeah it would not have advantage  laura 17  matt 17 you see a faint glimmer of some kind something that stands out its like a reflection  or bead of light amongst the grass fields beyond the forest youre unable to really tell the  distance but it does stand out as it occasionally flickers  laura flickering do i see any sign of a city  matt not from this perspective no mostly it looks natural from this view also the clouds in  the sky are slowly 
none	 moving like normal clouds and you can see in the distance what appears to be a  sun that has passed beyond the mountain range but there is no change in the light  laura the sky looks the same  matt same it was since the moment you arrived  laura well at least we know weve made some headway i go back down theres a tree line at  least i think we should reach it soon  taliesin and if we dont then we know that theres a problem  laura right  taliesin and remember in 
none	 theory from what little i know the prettier it is the more  dangerous it probably is and the older it is the more dangerous it probably is  marisha what things get prettier as they get older here thats not fair  sam just the men  marisha damn it  travis all right lets keep going then  matt okay you guys push on for another three or so hours  laura were not out of the tree line yet  matt at the pace you guys are walking you just begin to push outside of the trees 
none	 it was hard  gauging the distance from that period of time that was the rough estimate based on the  perception roll you begin to watch the tree line thin a bit theres still many trees around you  but the densitys beginning to scatter and youre beginning to see more and more light let through  from the treetops and the trees themselves are not as tall as they were towards the central bulk  of the forest vex you do catch to your left side something that sounds like at first a little hiss but  instead 
none	 it comes to your ear as a chuckle  laura hello  travis what  ashley did you hear something  laura is somebody there  matt make a perception check  laura ooh natural 20  matt natural 20 you glance out of the corner of your eye and you see about four trees behind you  some outline of a shaded figure that darts behind a tree  laura stage whisper did anybody else see that  all what  laura okay cool did it look childlike or adultlike  matt in between  laura oh okay  
none	 liam we got a problem here  laura just be ready  sam which direction  laura behind us i saw you  marisha lets get backtoback shall we  taliesin im going to sit backwards on the bear while we move forward  marisha im going to go backtoback to the twins  laura did you want to say hello  matt no response  laura all right i guess well have fun over here without you  travis are you sure you really saw something  laura laugh like i told a really funny joke  forced laughter 
none	  travis you kill me oh man who would want to miss this  sam i didnt know a nun could curse like that  laura so funny anything  matt you guys continue making your way towards the edge of the forest and shortly after the  tree line does come to an end there are small clusters of trees but beyond that youre now  opening this nearlyendless grassland the grasses themselves swaying with the breeze that is  starting to catch up you can see the waves that curl over these low hills and this beautiful  
none	 deep verdant greenemerald color that shifts and cascades over and over and over  as you begin to step into the grass its high its chesthigh to the halfelves a little below  waisthigh to you and the gnomes are swimming through grass at this point  travis hey buddy  ashley this is fun though  travis do you want to keep staying down there doing the breaststroke  ashley no im done  taliesin it occurs to me i dont actually have to ride the bear anymore  laura thats true do you guys want to ride trinket 
none	 and see  sam no thanks ill ride grog  travis yeah  ashley ill ride trinket  matt you hop on trinket  laura do you still have barkskin nice  marisha he looks good too right  taliesin shes done me up  ashley i give trinket a scratch where it makes him go weird and start scratching his neck  matt bear noises he reaches up and gives you a lick but it pseudopasses through your form and  trinket looks really confused and tilts the bear head to the side  ashley sorry buddy  laura 
town	 oh as were walking first question do i see any form of path through this grass  matt its open field directionless and before you there is still the dusk ahead of you thats  the best directional point you have right now but there is no worn path there is no road  or street there are no signs of civilization it looks like an endless field  liam ive played the original legend of zelda i know if we go up left down left we should get  out of this field  matt shoot the bush  
none	 laura the flicker of light i saw in the distance are we going to intersect it in the direction that  were going  matt you will get near it  laura okay so ill keep an eye in that direction as we move forward but i want to talk to you  keyleth  marisha yeah  laura ive been trying to find out a way to talk to trinket like i know you can right  marisha oh  laura i was wondering if maybe you could teach me how to do that  marisha gasps teach you 
none	  laura do you think thats possible  marisha i dont know but id like to try  laura okay  marisha yeah that would be fun okay can i do something like that  laura i have a spell slot available for speak with animals that i never claimed that i want to learn  matt you want to take it okay as you guys begin to walk through the field you begin to reveal  some of the druidic secrets of animal communication to vex and over the course of the  next hour of travel  marisha 
none	 see the thing is you have to get the accents right for each critter or else they could  get a little offended  travis and youre the point of access  marisha totally i keep going  matt she bestows upon you the elements of it its less about vocality its about being able to  connect on an empathic and emotional level where creatures can speak to you less out of words and  more out of the idea of emotions and thoughts which our human minds or in some cases  halfhuman minds accept as words there 
none	 is no actual speech that theyre talking like  hello my dear  marisha so one of the things that i like to do is embody the animal and that can get you in the  mindset  laura i will definitely keep that in mind  marisha lets practice being trinket together  laura i let her do that and im going to keep walking normally  matt she does it for a while  marisha i go up to grog sniffs groans  laura im learning so much  ashley i think were all learning this is so 
none	 great  sam i wish nala had cast blindness on me  laughter  laura can i walk up to trinket and say hey buddy can you understand me  matt do you cast the spell  laura yeah  matt trinket turns to you  laura do you understand me  matt yes  laura screams i hug him so hard oh my gosh  matt you grab him trinket doesnt seem to realize any sort of difference  laura could you understand me all the time  matt yes  laura oh darling but now i understand you 
none	 and its wonderful  matt okay  laura okay quick question do you mind being in my necklace or does it bother you whats it  like is it terrible because i dont want to do it if you hate it  matt its a little lonely  ashley oh no  matt i havent been in there very long  laura no you havent okay well thats good well i basically wanted to say that i love you so much  marisha i give her a thumbs up  matt i love you too vexahlia  laura sobbing i 
none	 start crying  matt a big lick upside your face and nudges his head against you  laura oh this is the best spell ever i cant believe i didnt know it before trinket thanks  keyleth  marisha the accents really good youre doing a good job its very good  matt as trinket nudges you he says its okay i can stay in there all you need  laura thanks buddy  matt i can watch you through there i can see you  laura you can wait you can  matt yes  laura cool its like 
none	 when your dog comes in the room when youre peeing its a little awkward at  first when you hear about it but its fine its okay im fine with it whatever  matt grog youve actually been in there so you have an idea of what hes talking about  laura if you understood what he was saying which you dont  matt boom what  taliesin im imagining the genie bottle  laura for a while as long as my spell lasts i want to keep talking to trinket and catch up on  old times  matt 
none	 you guys do and he talks about how he hated at the time but has in hindsight enjoyed the  memory of the pie contest in whitestone  laura oh right that was so good right  ashley what about getting his hair done with flowers and braids and bows  matt he tells you that was fine but you can tell through the subtle bear undertones that he wasnt  too happy about it but everything has this tone of basically whatever you need and anything for  you there is an undying loyalty and love from trinket that 
none	 youve always felt but now to hear  in language form is very moving  liam im watching quietly the whole time with a smile at this bear that ive known as a cub  grunting with my sister grunting back and its very touching  laura i love the feywild  travis i think the whole thing is fucking weird  marisha keyleth wipes away a little tear  ashley same im sitting on trinket wiping away tears  laura were walking  travis weve been walking this whole time  matt you guys keep walking and you keep 
none	 walking  sam we still havent hit that tree line  matt youre past the tree line youre in the grass but its hard to really gauge since you  have no sun in the sky and you dont have a central timepiece of any kind  laura do we feel tired  travis well hold on can i spin around and see if the grass weve been trampling on is leaving a trail  matt no none no trail its like you never stepped through behind you the grasses parted  where you walked through and then looking behind 
none	 its like you were dropped in the middle  of a field  travis is anything following us  matt make a perception check  laura there was that kid that we talked to  ashley good call  travis a deathly eight  laura there was a creature in the woods  taliesin that you saw  laura i saw it  travis nothing were good  ashley can i perception check  matt you can make a perception check as well yeah  taliesin vex do you feel like getting a little bit of a birdseye view really 
none	 quickly perhaps  ashley 14  matt glancing about a smooth grassline  travis were clear team monster  ashley no ones following us  sam what about this keyleth cant we move through the trees  taliesin we cant theres no trees  sam just grass  marisha i will turn around how far away are we from the treeline  matt from where you guys left  marisha yeah  matt its visible but its quite a ways away  marisha we have been moving away  matt yeah its the rolling fields and hills its comparable to 
none	 the width of the valley between  the cliffkeep mountains and the stormcrest mountains on taldorei it seems like such a vast  space with no immediate scattered landmarks in your head which is used to gauging your position  from small changes in the scenery its mindnumbing it feels like its endless  laura we have food were on our way  sam what if this is a weeks journey what if this is two weeks journey  marisha she said two days south  sam she said two dusks south what if this is a month  matt 
none	 she said two days duskward  laura two days duskward see two days  liam does that mean two days into dusk or two days that last an eternity  laura two days its two days  matt she said two days duskward  travis were fine  marisha but you were saying she was using two days in a way that we would understand  liam we dont know  taliesin im feeling pretty confident about this im not having a lot of stress about this  travis lets keep grooving suns up  taliesin until its time that 
none	 we all think its time to take a rest and well take a nap  laura yeah when we feel tired i do want to make sure that nothings following us on occasion  and make sure that nothing is around  travis we checked it out were solid  sam should one of us circle back and make  sure that no ones behind us  laura well get separated  marisha well never find each other again  sam all right then were going to keep going and ill keep reading my book on top of grog  
none	 marisha do we still see the flashing light in the distance that she saw  matt only at times because when you go below the hills into these deep valleys before you come to  the next hill line it cuts off your perspective but as you get close make another perception  check vex as youre keeping an eye on the back of trinket  liam wait you said vax do you mean vax or do you mean vex  matt i said vex  laura 18  matt 18 the source of the glimmer is becoming larger but 
none	 you cant make out any details there  are actually a few glimmers clustered its one of those things where its not perpetual every  now and then you see it  laura we are heading towards something im not sure what it is  marisha is it erratic  matt it seems erratic yeah  travis somethings on fire  taliesin its a party  sam press on  travis yeah  laura what else are we going to do  travis definitely nothing here  taliesin we press on until its time to rest  matt you push 
none	 on for a few more hours and trying to think back how long youve been here the time  passes in a strange way to the point where you have no way of understanding how much time has  gone by but youre starting to get a little tired like you would towards the end of a days worth of  travel you come up over a large hillside and you can see now theres a base of a mountain range  that you can make out a little bit in the distance that meets up where that flickering is 
none	 you can  see what appears to be now the source of the flickering there looks to be some sort of a  civilization there are towers there appears to be a stone ring around it its hard to make out  the details from this distance but it looks fairly large its in the side of the mountain range  taliesin i say we camp here i think its a lovely idea  travis whats around us grass fields pretty much  matt just grass fields  travis far as you can see  matt as far as you 
none	 can see and then the hill line eventually gets so high in the distance where  you cant see past it you see the mountain range and whatever the source of this glimmer is this  strange citylike series of structures at the base of that mountain range  travis yeah lets set up shop drop  laura can i fly up on the broom and see if i can see anything in the field around us or look for  any movement in the grass  sam dont forget your hat  laura i put my fucking hat on 
none	  taliesin it suits you its lovely im going to use my optics to try and sketch what i can of the  city for the moment and get a general idea of it sitting down and starting to get an idea of it  liam and does it look like anything from my sister and my memory  matt go ahead and roll a perception check on your end as well vax  laura and me  liam 20  matt as youre getting up sure go ahead and make one because you get a better view as well 
none	  laura 25  matt 25 vax its hard at this distance to make out much of the information especially with the  grass being as high as it is and the hill beyond it for the most part the folks that can get a  clear bead are those that are above the grass line and keeping a keen eye which vex is  laura oh whispers whispers  ashley singing whispers in the night  sam this is the anticipation that you feel before you open a loot crate not knowing what it could  be could it 
none	 be good could it be bad what you do know is that its 3 off if you use the code  criticalrole  taliesin dont try and super saiyan me  marisha amazing  taliesin oh not quite  marisha almost wait maybe the bigger one  laura hes been chewing on that just so you know in addition to that do i see anything in  the grass around us  matt from what you can see every now and then you see tiny little bits of movement in the grass  maybe a quarter mile one way you 
none	 can see a similar type winding shape in the grass a mile or  so the other way its even further out there are other things moving in the grass but none of them  are breaking the grass surface but they appear to be singular at least in the shifting of movement  you do catch a smaller source of movement in the grass no more than 30 feet off from where the  rest of your party is currently walking  laura can i fly down near it  matt yeah you swoop down and over view of 
dung	 that you can see what appears to be a small humanoid  that is curling through the grass line looks human big thick curled beard very coarse dark  hair a muscled torso stocky but strong what appears to be a light blue vest thats covering  the upper part of the torso most of the buttons missing and the bottom of it tattered and worn  the hindquarters themselves are fur and come into cloven hooves and you can see a small pair of  horns hooking off the back of the head this individual is skulking through the 
none	 grass carrying  a small book and a long quill and hes occasionally leaping up over the grass line  landing and then drawing something in the book  laura does he see me  matt he does not see you at the moment no youre overhead  laura i want to float down above him on the broom and lay down on the broom and say  what are you drawing  matt as soon as you come down and whisper the tome slams shut the figure stands up straight  slowly turns the eyes towards you and you 
dung	 can see the dark and ruddy skin the suntouched nose and  cheeks a darker more leathered texture to them but the eyes are piercing ice blue as he looks  back into yours nothing  laura nothing at all  matt just taking notes  laura on those people up there  matt yes  laura oh interesting  matt because why not  laura why not you know you probably could get a better view of them if you were riding on this broom  matt you see if youre worried its not me you need to worry

none	 by the elbow you  lift up and pull him out of the grass field now dangling his little feet in the middle of the air  as hes being dragged up the quill gets dropped and he looks for it and the books tumbling out  of his hand he grabs the book and clutches it to himself what are you doing  laura now i spin around and see if theres anything behind me  matt there is nothing visible in the vicinity  laura sneaky little fuck  matt please this is really high  laura it

town	 him  drawing and vandalizing the image of a number of you guys theres a picture of vax and keyleth  that are both covered in poo and slapping it on their face written in elvish i love this with  a word bubble its essentially a kid entertaining himself with a bunch of stupid pictures  taliesin this is an awfully expensive book to be this shitty in  marisha is this just your hobby your pastime or are you an actual records keeper for whatever town  this is because both would be humorous  matt no no 
none	 record keeper  taliesin im going much earlier in the book to see whats there  matt you start seeing a number of elven individuals you see people in really nice regal  armor but all of them are pooping themselves theres a bunch of elvish ladies with oversized  floppy boobs smacking each other in the face its truly childish but theyre really well drawn and  well shaded there is a serious talent to the artwork his skewed intent of imagery is  fascinating  liam im in the mood to hear this guys life story get him 
town	 a cup  laura i love them honestly i think youre quite talented  sam should we make camp here and invite him into the mansion  liam as long as hes secure yeah  marisha whats the name of this little town here that we see  matt that that is the elven city of syngorn theyve been here for a little while and theyve  been a gracious source of subjects  marisha and where do you live when syngorns not here  matt i live wherever i please i choose my place to rest  laura where

none	 any weapons  matt make an investigation check  sam hes got seven dicks  ashley nine  matt best you can find throughout his body the only thing that catches your attention is a  nowcrushed ocarina that he had on the inside of his pocket that did not survive the grasping of grog  sam we can fix it for him  ashley we can make you a new one somewhere  taliesin give me the bits  liam garmelie we have a very bad track record when we make friends we have been burned badly a

none	 ask do you want to go to syngorn we could avoid it  liam well we know no one here except for this guy we need to find you that bow i dont relish  the idea of dealing with our father but it seems like our best bet  laura right of course we should go see them  liam are you sure you want to though  laura of course why wouldnt i please and i walk back to the group  travis i give the satyr another drink  matt he greedily drinks it down  marisha 
tavern	 can i pet your fur is it coarse  travis keyleth  laura keyleth thats a bit forward  travis youre so touchy today  taliesin i understand  matt so if were here to talk and make this deal were discussing what is it you want from me  travis is he looking any more drunk  matt a slight slur  laura can i have some more ale as well grog keep it coming all around  travis yeah fine  taliesin honest opinion what is the disposition of the people in that city over on the hill 
none	 you  can be frank were not from around here you cant offend us with your opinion of them  matt its a busy place right now we havent seen the city of syngorn in close to a hundred  years at the very least and they have an entire army building up right now its hustle and bustle  taliesin they have an army building up why is that  matt hell if i know i just wandered through and used that distraction to acquire a few things and  make some fantastic notes  laura acquire what  
town	 matt things  laura do you steal darling  matt i dont steal i borrow indefinitely  taliesin you just pinch small things though like little gold trinkets this is not really a  talent of yours is it  liam are we talking klepto stealing or career  matt i take things that look nice that i think i would want  marisha where do you steal these things are you a pickpocket  matt i am no simple street thief i am a procurer of wayward items and objects that need a  better home  travis i

none	 you wouldnt stay out of it  matt he takes it from you he sloshes it around and makes wild gestures its a dangerous place  its been a source of vileness and ichor here in the feywild for hundreds of years its a  terrible horrible cesspool of nothing im so sorry this is getting everywhere  sam dont worry the servants will get it its terrible because of what dwells there or because  of the place itself  matt both all of it  sam what dwells there  matt creatures things trollish slime creatures  laura 
none	 do you have drawings have you drawn things from there  matt i sketched a thing or two  sam which page  taliesin flip flip flip  matt you take a moment to scan through and there are all sorts of creatures all drawn stupidly  many with extra private parts coming out of shoulders and stuff around page 163 164 and  you see and there are creatures all throughout but at that page in particular you see a lanky  tall humanoid that is oozing black thick viscous tar its shaded in a way where it looks 
none	 like it  has that glaze that only thick oillike substances really give off and its dragging this  absolutely unnecessarily large dong behind it about four feet every picture looks pretty good  to a point and then youre like aw really  laura garmelie that creature is it very large  matt its a little bigger than you  laura oh shit  matt gestures and takes his drink back  marisha does it have a name whats this called  matt i havent gotten close enough to it  liam but you know how to get there

none	 im sure theres many poison trees  travis how far from here would you say it is  matt day and a half maybe duskwardseaward maybe  travis hes been very helpful maybe he could just point us in the direction  sam no were taking him were taking him as far as we can we need guides who know the land  matt then let us make the other side of this agreement you want me to be your guide youll  give me back my book he sets the drink down back my book and he looks at 
none	 the rest of you  you seem to speak like you know thievery yes  sam one of us is a member of a thieves guild  matt theres a few things in that there dreary elvish city that i havent the skills to procure  but if you wouldnt mind maybe borrowing them for me in my stead well weve a done deal  travis borrowing them indefinitely  liam what are we discussing exactly  sam quid pro quo  matt if you will  laura ive got no problem stealing from any of those people  liam 
none	 yes but the devils in the details what are we after tell me a little bit more  matt we make the agreement first  liam say again  matt we make the agreement first consider it a bit of trust  liam balls is what that is  taliesin let us add an addendum then if we are going to steal things from you you will not only  take us to the bog  marisha but youll take us to our final destination  matt nope no no shademirk im out sorry  sam or we could kill 
none	 you here  taliesin are we killing people  sam we could kill him  travis do i get to grab him again  marisha remember you have to be nice to things in the feywild this is what weve learned  sam we have a powerful position in negotiation im a master negotiator  taliesin no  marisha what is he doing  sam whos getting whispered to percy percy goes blind again every five minutes  taliesin this is interesting 17  sam a roll and a rewhisper  laura the feywild slippery sneaky  sam this is 
dung	 crazy  taliesin interesting  sam he just said the cword the fword the gword  matt if its that important to you to go to this dark place then keep the book all right i can  draw more  taliesin ive got an idea we broke your ocarina correct  matt yes  taliesin why dont i try and fix the ocarina we give him his book back we take a couple things  from those people and get on our way we could just get on our way  marisha not have him at all  taliesin 
none	 no lets make the deal and get this moving this is a place where deals happen lets  do it  travis but youre usually so picky about details what if he asks us to steal somebody  liam were talking about a pantsless cartoonist in the middle of fairy land  taliesin we agree to the deal we present it and then were there  laura if we cant steal the things then the deal is off  matt its that simple we both go our separate ways and good luck finding the shademirk on your own  taliesin 
none	 its kismet in my opinion  laura well i trust you percy if you think its smart  ashley can i insight check percy because hes acting a little strange  liam same  matt you can make an insight check but hes not acting too far out of his normal place here  liam yeah but ive done insight checks before because hes percy  laura did you do it  ashley yeah but i didnt get anything  liam i got a 15 balls  matt its an interestingly tense conversation its hard to ride one way or 
none	 the other but its a  valid point if worse comes to worst and what hes asking for is beyond your grasp or something  that you wish not to do then the deal is off and you go your separate ways  taliesin were in the feywild were going to make a deal with something this is what the  feywild is  travis all right fine  liam i turn to vex you like this idea you want to do this  laura i have no love for that city i dont care  taliesin i want to 
none	 go there too  marisha the people were stealing from better be meanies though and they better have deserved it  at some point  laura ultimately i would love to ask them to help us in our fight theyre cowardly and stupid  for hiding but we could use their help if theyre making an army  liam possibly better equipped and better educated sorry than this one here  marisha well garmelie also said they were strengthening up an army did they ever have a  standing army before  matt they did  laura they did of 
none	 course they did theyre a city  matt it wasnt a huge army per se but they had trained forces and they had a means of defending  their city  laura we had a fight instructor when we were growing up  liam theyre elves theyre very civilized theyve all got sticks up their asses theyre  fucking elves  taliesin i cant wait  matt i like this one  sam are you going to fix his whatisitcalled  taliesin give me your ocarina let me see if i can get to work on it  marisha i

none	 the materials  here but what you have on you as part of your traveling tinkering kit you piece together a  nearly unnoticeable binding agent for clay and dirt and earthbased materials you manage to fix  the ocarina rather quickly in a period of maybe 20 minutes and with the help of keyleths  druidcraft dry it and manage to get it fixed  taliesin your instrument sir  matt thank you thats one good deed youve done me today i appreciate that  travis dont forget about all them ales yeah  matt whistles its awful he

none	 tried to use countercharm but i dont know how to use it  laughter  sam apparently its some sort of preemptive thing i have to read about it oh shit im  already reading this goddamn it  laughter  sam anyway what do you think we should do  taliesin i dont know what we can do  sam wait when were you charmed what did it affect what decisions did you make today that  were key  taliesin we made a bloody deal with him  sam well we can always back out on the deal 
none	  taliesin well no we cant really  sam what is there some sort of blood pact that we made  taliesin sputtering i dont know exactly how it works its just in any book you read about the  feywild you make a deal and its a deal and you have to deal with it  sam what does mean you and i could go down to his room right now and kill him and be done with it  taliesin i dont think that would work  sam would we be cursed  taliesin maybe  sam haunted

none	 know weve got to make sure that pike doesnt give him back his whistle just yet  laura why did you want to fix his whistle you just liked him  taliesin he was so nice he was just so nice  laura damn it i thought you knew something we didnt know i really thought you did  taliesin i did its sadly what i knew was hes a little shit i just didnt know until about half  an hour ago i hate magic  laura percy change of subject would you say i look put together well 
none	 off with this armor  taliesin in what sense  laura well you come from money right  taliesin yes  laura right so do i look like i come from money  taliesin does she look like she comes from money  matt thats entirely up to your opinion you know the attire she wears youve traveled with her  its based on what you want to base that judgment on whether it be pure looks the person inside  its whatever percival thinks she would be in his eyes  sam quietly shes naked in a hat  
none	 taliesin laughs honestly dear youre too happy to look like you come from money  laura laughs i dont believe that  taliesin no its a sure sign of it is an abject misery believe me i can speak to it you  look too much like you and you dont look enough like something youre supposed to be if you feel  the urge to deeply bullshit id be happy to help you its not hard  laura no  taliesin no it is easy to pretend you come from money you just have to be a bit of 
none	 a shit and wear  what everybody else is wearing does this have something to do with that city it does doesnt  it whos there  laura well you know everyone we were judged growing up and i dont look forward to seeing  that again  taliesin sighs well  laura its not important  taliesin oh i disagree dear i think that if youre worried about them knowing whether or not  youve made your money and made your fortune i dont think thats going to be the thing to earn  their respect i think youre 
none	 better off a with the company that you keep and b with the fact  that youre probably just better than most of them  laura laughs  taliesin ive known a lot of people with money and they are definitely not worth you and  besides if they have something nice that makes you feel inferior we can just take it  laura laughs i like the way you think  taliesin well and then theyre just shit without anything and then youre you with their stuff  laura thank you percy  taliesin youre welcome i know it 
none	 doesnt really help  laura will you stay at my side when were there  taliesin yes and the outfit works dont change it keep the hat  laura laughs all right good night  taliesin good night sleep well  laura well sort out this charmed mess in the morning  taliesin im sorry for my part in it  matt so you guys go your separate ways you find yourself eventually to bed as the rest of the  group is asleep vex you take a bit of solace in the conversation finish cleaning your things  though 
none	 it doesnt seem like the incessant scrubbing you were driven on has much purpose nor  the impact you thought it might at this point and you resign yourself to sleep for the evening as  the evening comes to a close pike you wake up early as you come out of your room you struggle  with the view of 20 guards slowly shifting through the foyer as a very hungover and groaning satyr  begins clomping through the main foyer going breakfast please please breakfast  ashley yes follow me to the kitchen  matt yes someone they 
none	 listen to thank you rubbing his eyes as he follows you into the  kitchen he comes up onto one of the long benches in the center of one of the main dining tables  ashley i put down a cup of coffee for him and i run into the kitchen and get a very large oh no  matt are you poisoning me  ashley whats wrong  matt what is this  ashley its coffee  matt i dont like coffee  ashley oh what do you want  matt something thats not coffee  ashley okay can 
none	 we get him something thats not coffee  matt the servants look at each other confused and wander off and come back with a carafe of an apple juice  ashley apple juice will be great  matt that is familiar thank you he takes the carafe  ashley i run in the kitchen really quick and get a very large piece of butcher paper  matt okay  ashley okay so garmelie  matt yes  ashley i think youre so talented and i wanted to ask if maybe you could draw a family portrait  for us the 
none	 most ridiculous you can make it  matt what do you mean  ashley just of all of us i want to hang it above the mantel before everybody wakes up  matt well its hard to do without seeing the subjects but if you want to fill in the details  ashley yeah fill in the details  matt all right well i need a quill or some charcoal  ashley vax gave you a quill last night  matt he gave me a feather it has to be refined into a quill  ashley oh i forgot i 
none	 think theres one in the kitchen  matt there is no quill in the kitchen but glancing around and asking the servants there are  pieces of charcoal there is charcoal available sketch charcoal  ashley okay can you use charcoal  matt of course  ashley great  matt all right  ashley have at it  matt you first  ashley sure  matt all right  sam its leonardo and winslet  ashley and marisha draw me like one of your french girls  matt you hear the gentle lyrical stylings of celine dion swell in background 
none	 as the satyr  quickly begins sketching your charcoal form  ashley and remember very ridiculous  matt i dont know what that means but ill do my best in rapid time faster than anyone youve  ever seen sketch his form almost becomes blurred with the haste in which he draws and within the  hour he has completed an extremely welldetailed portrait and i mean portrait as everyone is  standing shoulder to shoulder like a family above a mantel and it is grotesque horrifying you  look like perhaps the trickfoots had been keeping the bloodline strong 
none	 for a very long period of  time droopy face one eye sinking below the other you dont even have the right number of fingers  you see grog in the back who is as wide as the rest of everybody is behind them this giant wall  with this tiny little head with a tongue lolling out to the side it looks like he has one finger  as a thumbsup and the other ones up his bum  in the front you see vex and vax the twins are furiously making out in a really horrible display  
none	 clutching each other its terrifying  keyleth is currently clutching the side of a tree happily and as she does her eyes are going in  different directions and the tree itself is trying to push her off the branch  you see percy who is extremely tall with this squat thin head with these giant glasses that  make his eyes bugeyed and strange you see a little bit of scruff on the chin thats actually  turning into this long awful matted dingleberry mess of a goatee and he has both of his guns  pointed at his 
none	 head  next to that is a perfectly defined unchanged portrait of scanlan shorthalt  ashley i just wanted to hear you explain it so im going to take it and im going to paste it  above the mantel im going to go back upstairs to my room  matt okay eventually you all come to consciousness brought to the wonderful welcome  morning scent of once again a chickenful breakfast you find yourselves down to a once  again passedout satyr slumped over the breakfast table with two plates of mostly devoured chicken  mashed potatoes and a 
none	 couple other side elements  laura that sounds so good  matt there above on the mantel across the room is a glorious sketch of the family of vox machina  taliesin charming  sam who changed my oh i look pretty good  marisha this is brilliant wait scanlan why do you look normal  sam i think we all look normal actually thats how i see us sure  laura this picture is disgusting  marisha i love it  taliesin no that is awful  marisha you guys we have a souvenir we have a souvenir from 
none	 the feywild  travis i think he wants a beating thats what he wants  laura i flick his head  matt yes what what hi  travis why would you do that when weve been so hospitable  matt its a gift make a persuasion check  ashley 15  matt he goes i thought id leave you a little present  ashley i love it  laura well its gross but everybody else looks quite wonderful  taliesin i sit down right in front and across the table  travis i guess i dont mind at least im 
none	 big  taliesin i like it  liam i think its gross  matt eat up and well be on our way he notices the tension from percy and grog  taliesin no not yet not yet just so all cards are on the table we know that we agreed to a deal  last night despite your charm spell on me which was  matt defending myself as was warranted  taliesin fair play  travis you got charmed  laura i do think we should inform you though we may have used a little magic on you sorry 
none	 just  to make sure the deal was solid  matt im certain that was a necessary precaution  taliesin well the deal stands as it is at the moment i suppose  matt wondrous i had hoped as such because we have much to gain  ashley wait  taliesin yeah no he charmed me he put a charm on me last night  ashley i had a feeling  liam so you no longer think its a good idea to enter into this agreement  taliesin well a little late  matt it is a little late  
none	 ashley you never told us what you wanted  matt im going to show you  laura youre going to walk us right in  matt something like that  travis well might as well  marisha what are you going to do  sam why dont you pet his legs again weirdo  marisha you fascinate me  matt good thats not the first time ive heard that  taliesin friend i applaud your cleverness i am excited by this deal and i want to let you know  that god forbid something comes up where i come from 
none	 the world i come from i am possibly the  worst person you have ever met and i think i hope not necessarily to hurt you or harm you but  i hope that one day you can know just how awful i can be  matt make an intimidation check  taliesin 17  matt stuttering i hope it never comes to that  taliesin lets hope  matt i can make addendums to the art piece if youre unhappy  taliesin i love the art piece actually since were on the subject have you ever drawn yourself  
none	 before  matt many times  taliesin id be curious to see one of your self portraits are they in the book  matt no  taliesin i didnt think so selfreflection is not one of my favorite pastimes either anyway  what are you looking for in the city  matt ill show you as part of the agreement itll be unveiled upon arrival  sam sounds good to me  laura thats not sneaky at all i fully trust you  matt great now finish your food much to do much to see much to take  laura 
none	 i hate him now  matt offkey music  marisha no we did that for you do not abuse this thats right  ashley what are you doing with your hands  matt where did what  taliesin where did what  matt they giveth and they take away  taliesin bless the small print  matt well then eat well and he makes his way toward the door and the guards stop him there  ill just sit here then and sits on the floor waiting for you guys to finish  laura what sort of magic did you 
none	 cast on us  matt what do you mean  laura what was the deal we agreed to what will happen if it breaks  matt deals are meant to be kept should you go against a deal that youve made especially in  here these realms there are consequences so dont stray from the deal  taliesin i think its just a deal i think deals may be a big deal here  sam so we can still kill him  taliesin i dont know i think if it comes to it its a possibility  marisha what happened 
none	 to dont hurt or touch anything in the feywild  laura yeah we fucked that up didnt we  ashley can i take out his ocarina and play a couple of notes while im looking at him  matt sure make a performance check  sam performance check  taliesin thats a thing  travis is this your first performance check  sam youre definitely the right person to be doing this  ashley yeah right 13  matt 13 in a very rudimentary kindergarten recorder way offkey music its a little shaky  but you get the hang of 
none	 it its the only sound in the room its dead quiet as you do this in the  middle of breakfast with food being brought to the table  laura that was amazing pike  liam move over scanlan holy hell that was good  ashley thanks i learned once  laura i dont think ive ever seen anyone play an instrument that well  sam wait hey this is my house  liam oh look the satyrs sad whats the matter friend  matt she has my ocarina  laura oh thats terrible poor guy  taliesin youre clever 
none	 im sure youll be fine  ashley maybe well give it back to you but i know what you did to my friend with this little  thing so im not going to give it back to you not just yet  matt eat your breakfast  ashley already did  liam somebody get this poor asshole a handkerchief he looks so sad  matt he sits there and pouts as you guys finish your meal laughing and enjoying yourselves  marisha as he pouts i druidcraft a little flower crown for him  matt he somehow recedes even further 
none	 into his grumpy self his neck disappearing as his head  pulls into his torso  marisha hes so fun to mess with  laura we are really shit at making friends  travis so im curious while were eating would you happen to tell us what our first objective  might be  laura hes going to show us  taliesin i think its time to make our way in  travis yeah im full  ashley im going to walk over to scanlan scanlan  sam what  ashley im going to give this to you  sam 
none	 the macarena  ashley yeah because i dont like performing  sam youre really good at it  ashley thats a lie just take this and maybe you can charm some people with it i dont know if  thats what it is but i dont want him to have it  sam thank you i will try my best  ashley all right lets go  taliesin cant believe i wasted a natural 20 on his sorry im good  matt you guys finish your breakfast the guards come with you and escort you and your ally outside  
none	 the door as you exit the  marisha wait take and roll up the painting the charcoal drawing that he did and put it in the bag  of holding  laura its going to disappear as soon as we take it out leave it in the mansion that way itll stay  taliesin its from the mansion so itll stay in the mansion  marisha will it stay in the mansion  matt youve tried taking things out of the mansion and theyve turned to dust  marisha but i know things will also get ejected from the mansion 
dung	 okay ill leave it  matt you take it down talk put it back up no worries as you guys exit the mansion the dusk  light of the sky has not changed you get the idea here at least since youve arrived that there  has been no movement in the sun you havent even seen the sun the light source of dusk beyond the  distant mountains and horizon is stuck in the dusk hour with the threat and curl of midnight in the  opposite direction the dark blue coming over the horizon unmoving it also is 
none	 raining gently  there is a rather heavy cloud that has come over and its not a terrible downpour but a gentle  rainfall has been here for a while and the floor between the grasses is quite slushy as you step  out squelch  sam lets go to the city  marisha vex should we be dressing for the occasion should we put on our nice cloaks  taliesin we do have nice cloaks we could wear  sam i think were going to be sneaking in to steal things  laura no theres no way we could 
none	 sneak in  liam were going to go in and make introductions and get settled and then figure out what the fuck  were doing  marisha yeah cloak me  laura with what  marisha our nice cloaks  laura he has some fancy cloaks unless hes used them all  taliesin am i still made of wood by the way  matt no that faded with the nights rest  travis i dont have fancy robes i do have your fancy winter stuff  taliesin its raining its not like hawaii rain its rain i would assume its 
none	 not chilly but cold  marisha ill cloak up try and look like i made some sort of effort  travis all right keyleth gets a cloak do you want some nice shit  taliesin oh yes  liam im not changing anything  sam how long will it take to get to the city from where we are  matt a few hours maybe  laura cant you craft something to keep the rain off of us  marisha ill do a little cantrip gust over top of us to make one of those air umbrellas that would  
dung	 never work in real life  matt okay you guys would have to get close together to do that but its doable as a cantrip  she keeps this general revolving sphere of wind above that scatters most of the rain to the sides  for the most part grog you still get pretty damp because of your size and difficulty but most  everyone else can stay pretty dry as you cluster together walking through the grass  you travel for another hour or so before the grass towards the outskirts of the mountain range in the  city 
none	 begins to slowly subside it grows thinner and shorter and you come to a bit of marshland  almost treeless open marshland with little bushes in clusters anything you guys want to  laura perception check see if i can see anything moving ahead of us  matt okay perception check  laura 29  matt okay as you guys begin walking into the marsh you can see there are areas where its  elevated mud patches where its very shallow water maybe an inch at most and there are a few  different areas that get noticeably deep and 
none	 murky you watch to avoid those elements youre  not sure what might be beneath if anything but you naturally move through this terrain carefully  you do notice that occasionally upon this walk you see different from the rest of the bushes and  pieces of terrain these deep bluish purple sprout leaves almost like carrot tops very leafy plant  top emerges in places occasionally clusters of two or three there arent a lot of them but many  of them occur throughout the walk in this swampy landscape  laura garmelie what are these  matt oh 
none	 these are best to be avoided theyre mandrake dont disturb them dont pull them out  dont do anything with them  marisha mandrakes oh cool  laura lets leave it  taliesin ive read things about those  laura whats this  taliesin thats just a thing just read it  liam its a potted screaming baby leave them  matt best left to the side you guys make your way through the marsh occasionally passing by the  mandrake tops until it begins to subside the marshland itself and you come towards the base of  the city 
none	 before you  you see a massive ivycovered wall of jadelike stone surrounding a dense cluster of towering  trees unlike those in any of the surrounding forests or the one you left it is an open plain  and then within the city walls there are trees emerging many stories into the air trees that you  guys recognize have always been there these trees came with the city and theyre actually from the  verdant expanse where syngorn usually resides  as you walk closer you can see large sealed gates every so often along the outer wall 
none	 every so  often you see these gates embedded in the wall housing a massive emblem of a crescent moon  flanked by two trees over a deep cerulean stone about two feet across twins you know these as  the threshold crests these are the enchanted crests that enable the city to travel back and  forth between the feywild should it be necessary theyre powerful and theyre rarely utilized as  the journey is not always accurate it seemingly did so this time  make a perception check guys  travis everybody or just the twins  matt 
none	 everybody whos paying attention  sam im not im reading  laura this is not woods anymore this is not forest is this marsh  matt just past marsh into flatland 20  marisha 21  laura 21  liam 21  ashley 15  matt okay you guys continue towards the front of the gate theres nobody on the outside of it  its a solid outside city you can see white and gray tower spires that streak up from inside some  of which are entwined by trees that wrap around the base and cluster around the center 
none	 of the  towers height like its own canopy belt if you will  as you get even closer still you can see the white walls themselves are replaced with heavy  gold and brass goldleaf edging across the top and at each one of the various nooks where the  solid stone walls are adjoined this is a very intricately carved and wellcrafted wall probably  as part of the enchantment that was placed on it amongst others to keep it defended  you get about a hundred feet from the wall before you vex hear scrape a quick 
none	 sound you leap  back instinctually as all of you watch a series of bolts and arrows arrow impacts across the floor  right in front of you  sam thats exciting  matt you all stop in place  sam should we attack  marisha i look up on the wall is it coming from archers on the wall  matt you can now see up on the wall dozens of figures atop with longbows and some with  crossbows drawn and nocked trained on all of you  laura i take my hood down you know us were 
none	 here to see my father  matt theres a pause and theyre still 100 feet away from you one of the voices says  who is us if i might ask  laura the twins vexahlia and vaxildan  liam syldors children  matt theres a little bit of a conversation you see a couple of figures disappear behind the wall  about five minutes pass and as you guys get a little fidgety or one of you makes a swift  movement you can see the drawn bows tense up theyre trained on any movement you guys give at 
none	  this moment as time passes an individual steps up to the top of the wall adorned in similar  syngorian armor but the helmet is taken off and you see a woman with deep crimson hair braided to  one side and shaved on the other she steps up and looks out vexahlia vaxildan  laura do we know who she is  matt the vessar twins return do i know why what is your business here in syngorn  laura we came to speak to our father  matt and the rest of your company  liam theyre 
none	 with us  matt make a persuasion check both of you  liam 20  laura 14 ill stop using that one tonight  matt come forth to the gate relieve your arrows please the guards all take their bows  off of you and release the tension in the strings the woman turns and steps off the wall again you  can see the very front gate the front of the wall opens ever so slightly about a fivefoot  gap left  liam everybody let my sister and i do the talking for a minute thank you i 
none	 scoop up my  sisters hand down by my side and walk forward  matt as you guys walk single file continuing towards the city your satyr friend stays in the  very back behind you clutching whimpering as you glance back grog hes not there  laura can you still feel him oh sorry  travis can i reach down to where he was  matt still tugging hes holding on to you but has lost visibility  travis clever little spider monkey  matt as you guys approach there waiting at the side of the gate within are 
none	 about ten guards and  this individual she looks a little more battlehardened and wasnt elevated before was  just one of the guards when you were children but this is iova  now watcher iova the watchers which guard the wall she appears to be of an elevated status  within the watchers of syngorn as you approach she lowers her head in a respectful bow but still  not breaking eye contact and has an aloof and distanced expression  laura watcher iova nice to see you have elevated yourself  matt time has passed since you were 
none	 finding your own path surprised to see you return here  especially so far from the material realms  liam then you can imagine there is great cause for us to be here  matt is your father aware of your arrival  laura no  matt he is now you and your guests will be watched you will be followed until otherwise  given proof and permission from individuals higher than my station within the city preferably your father  laura i would expect nothing less  matt now go and welcome to syngorn she turns around puts her 
town	 helmet on and half the guard  walk away while another six remain behind keeping watch  taliesin interesting  marisha not quite a warm welcome  taliesin i wouldnt expect one  laura i guess we should probably make our way straight to so we can have free rein  liam i motion for the rest to come up behind  matt as the rest of you approach and find your way within the city walls youre met with an  astounding cityscape hundreds of homes and buildings and sanctuaries formed with a natural  grace and keen architectural 
none	 mind as to seem almost grown from the trees and earth themselves  upon closer look and a nearby inspection you can see the craftsmanship but from a distance its  almost like they were born from the materials than they were built or crafted you can see  distant magical lantern light shines all across the city like the start of a glittering snowfall  as the rest of the streets themselves are ever lit by these little shining beacons  the center of the ageless place is divided by a grand lake of pure blue water a roiling 
none	 mist  drifting across the surface obscuring the view of boats currently on the surface of the water you  do notice a large military presence within the city as the armored guard of syngorn these  individuals the armored military force known as the verdant guard are walking throughout the  city not with a hurried pace but there is a general tension in the air far more than youve  ever seen in all the years that you did spend in your youth within syngorn thats where well  finish our session for the evening  laura shit 
none	  ashley i felt like we were just getting started  matt its 1030 though  ashley how  laura i guess you just have to fly in next week too  ashley i wish i could  matt as i look down and once again notice my tick spoons shirt ive had on the entire evening my  overshirt seems to have been shortening it to  travis poon  ashley oh i noticed  matt or even better  marisha poo  laura well thats okay it says spoon  matt spoon its intended to be it all
