marisha balanced breakfast  matt welcome back everyone i just physically ordered the other torch so thatll be fixed soon  because sometimes you just got to do it yourself anyway welcome back so to continue from where we  left off for tonights episode of critical role vox machina our heroic players and characters in  fighting their way across the land of taldorei against the chrome conclave a gathering of  ancient chromatic dragons that have torn the current civilization asunder theyve gathered a  number of artifacts of /none/ old called the vestiges of divergence and recently made allies with one of  these dragons raishan the green dragon of the conclave apparently interested in revolting  against the conclaves leader thordak the cinder king a tentative alliance has been forged and to  prove both the stalwartness of that alliance as well as to further your agenda against the  conclave you all traveled back to wildemount to the ruins of draconia with the help of the  ravenites you set a trap for vorugal the frigid doom you summoned using your single gate scroll  from the /none/ abyss yenk the goristro a great powerful siege demon and caused it to battle with  the white dragon partway through the encounter got more intense you all rushed into the fray got  the crap kicked out of you in a lot of cases but when all was said and done with the aid of  raishan you felled vorugal the final shot being landed by vexahlia herself  laura thank you  matt you guys have now taken a moment youve discussed with raishan to meet back in whitestone  after which she reverted form and vanished and /none/ youve now begun to collect your spoils and gather  what you can from the battlefield at this moment so thats where we pick up this week what would  you like to do  liam man weve gotta find larkin  laura did you have dragon bits you wanted to gather  marisha i did very much so  taliesin and some yenk i imagine  marisha a little bit of yenk a little bit of dragon  laura i got a little yenk blood already  matt you did  liam brazen guys  matt all right so /none/ youre heading to the dragon or yenk first  marisha dragon  matt okay so you head to the dragon  okay so you guys head over there you now see partially elements of the wall that had crumbled  in on vorugals body you see now emerging from the center of the scales in the chest as it lays  on its back slain its throat torn out by raishan a piercing tree begins to burrow its way  through the torso of the dragon and bloom outwards waiting for that process to finish you  bring out your /town/ carving dagger and  marisha i patiently wait for the tree  matt okay  marisha i dont want to interrupt thats rude  matt it grows pretty fast as part of the enchantment of fenthras so that brief pause  completed you go to town with your blade on the dragons corpse lets go ahead and make a check  on this this would be  marisha nature right  matt yeah  marisha with advantage oh thats good 28  matt 28 okay itll take you the better part of about an hour to really harvest everything you /none/  want from this thats usable and thats with aid from scanlan because its a very big dragon and  thats a pretty small blade so you begin that process  laura i can help i want to go up and carve a bear onto the tree growing out of vorugal  taliesin i may lend my cutdragonlikebutter blade to this whole process  matt okay  sam can i just pull off a scale a single scale is that really hard to do  matt make a strength check  sam two  matt you spend the next minute /none/ and a half going grunting sounds its not budging  sam its actually three  matt oh the next minute and 20 seconds going grunting sounds  sam great  matt you do manage to found a couple loose scales on the ground nearby after youve thoroughly  embarrassed yourself  sam ill grab one and then ill immediately start yelling for tooma yelling tooma  matt okay while hes doing that what are you guys doing  travis right so the dragons got booty right  laura yeah like a lot  travis so i look over and theyre /none/ working on the dragon bits everythings cool yenk is like  melting into the snow right because hes like a hell fiend or whatever  matt yeah  travis i take off running towards the lair  laura grog  sam im going to go with  matt grogs already run off scanlans following  sam im going to polymorph into an eagle  laura fucking fuck do you guys have this  marisha yeah  laura give me a claw i want a claw to wear around my neck  marisha youre going to be like mr t  /none/ laura i want something to wear around my neck fucking something all right  taliesin well find something  laura ill take off on the broom after grog  liam just scooping up pike into a bit of a piggy back ride and carrying her inside and were going  to rest  matt okay shes thoroughly hurt but you still have the entrance to the mansion yeah so you  guys pull into there to rest for the moment while grog as youre running this eagle comes up to  your side is gaining on you a bit as /none/ you come over the top of this one little ridge area as the  ravine begins to widen and head towards the lair portion that vorugal was using you see before you  a group of about 22 or so armored dragonborn that are currently jogging up the ramp in your  direction as soon as you cross over the top they come to a slower point with their weapons out  and you see one of them raise its hand you recognize skork who you met earlier who goes  weve come to aid you  tavis im still /none/ raging using persistent rage and i point over my shoulder and yell dragon that way  and i keep running past them  matt all right they pick up their weapons and keep running past you as you whoosh through them the eagle  following closely after  sam is tooma with them  matt tooma is not with them no  laura i followed too i am following as well  matt yeah you coast up behind you begin catching up to grog and the wayward eagle youre  the fastest of everything right now  sam im following /none/ him  matt so youre staying back at same speed okay as you guys begin carving you begin hearing the  footsteps approaching of numerous dragonborn the rest of you guys continue down the path you see  the icy throne if you will of where vorugal had placed as the new lair on this northern portion of  the ravine you guys that are staying behind as youre carving your way into the dragon all of a  sudden you hear the footsteps and a bunch of these dragonborn armored with scavenged pieces  leather hide with metallic bits /none/ of armor weapons definitely not of the highest degree from what you  can tell though some are ornate and seemingly unused maybe scavenged from the fall of draconia  they approach and slow their jog and look over at the destroyed corpse of the dragon  marisha hi  taliesin things went well  marisha man how long of a jog is that  matt they all look confused at each other and start talking to each other in a language you  dont understand  marisha man ooh vex isnt here  taliesin no all good good  /none/ travis fuck  matt they nod and skork gives a respectful nod and they all approach the dragons corpse and  start hacking into it  marisha oh no wait no hold on  taliesin no im going to point at all you all sun goes down all of us drink back there  go back everythings fine  matt skork takes two steps forward and goes i understand this speak  taliesin oh why didnt you say something youre standing there making us very nervous  matt disgruntled grunt look we have to come to aid you in the /none/ battle as promised you have  seemingly done well without our presence so lets all harvest the uses of what remains of this beast  taliesin im fair with that all right harvest gently were trying to keep as much of it  marisha yes im working right here on this area and vex wants a claw  matt take what you wish we are interested in hide and meat  taliesin and we are interested in scale tooth and claw and maybe some eyeballs so that works  out very well  marisha and blood  matt perhaps some /none/ teeth and claws as well we shall trade speaks draconic all of them rush  up and start hacking into the soft portions of the underbelly where its been exposed from where you  guys have left large wounds and such and basically start to carve huge bits of dragon meat off the body  taliesin mind the tree mind the tree  matt one of them was going for the tree and stops like and then looks very confused that the tree  wasnt piercing through the dragon but was rooted inside of it they all take a moment /town/ to start  carving around it its a very awkward they dont know what the hell happened and it looks very  strange from an outsiders perspective but theyre trying to adjust best they can  travis new town square will be built around it  matt in the meantime the three of you guys coast down towards the lair you can still see all the  ice spires that are jutting out from portions of the snow the various dragonborn corpses still  adorning a number of the spires as you begin to approach the throne of vorugal you /none/ can see  theres a group of about 15 or so dragonborn currently there that are starting to climb up and  get to that portion to inspect you see first before anyone else does vex that one of them  appears to be tooma who is walking with this gnarled staff that she keeps to her side and  theyre all approaching and climbing up the sides of the throne to get to the top  laura i shout out dont go up there  matt you shout that and theres a moment of pause then all of them /none/ turn and look in your  direction  laura i fly down close to tooma and say quietly thordak has means of seeing through the stones up  there if you go up top its possible hell be able to know that vorugal has fallen he might  already know  matt this is good to know speaks draconic and the dragonborn around slowly pull backwards  you understand her saying hold off words of warning they all pull back and gather around  you and stand awaiting what this conversation is going to entail as tooma steps forward to /none/ you so  am i to understand then that the dragon has fallen  laura laughing yes  sam ill drop my form and throw the scale in front of her its done theres your fucking  dragon  matt she looks over at the rest of the people who are all looking towards her for confirmation she  goes you came to us with words you stood behind them you displayed honor and honesty things we  find rare in supply outside of our people us the ravenites survivors of chain and frost are now  truly free we /none/ thank you  laura and we thank you  sam but well need something more than just thanks we have two requests to make of you one  this is not the final fight there will be more and unlike this fight we would expect your aid in  the next one is that something you can guarantee us  matt i am curious as to what you require from us  sam we dont know yet but you have many men and they seem like good fighters so we may call upon  you in the future  matt /none/ against what foe  laura thordak the ancient he was commander of all of these dragons  matt you see her face immediately goes from that calm welcoming elated expression she had a  moment ago to this guarded retracted position where she shifts her weight onto the back leg and  laura you are not beholden to us we ask this of your own free will all of taldorei is at risk  matt we are not an army we wish to help in this fight for we had a stake in it both of us this  was /none/ a mutual arrangement you owe us nothing we owe you nothing but we are not ready to continue  the fight immediately with a more dangerous foe than this one  sam hopefully it wont be immediately and might i remind you that you did not help us in this  fight we did it all by ourselves  matt who do you think arranged through previous conversation to send the dragon your way into the  trap that you had sprung at my suggestion of the place of proper and most conventional and helpful  circumstances  laura its /none/ true scanlan they did help a lot in that regard  matt we may not have the might to finish the dragon  sam you told us that you would have men there to help us and there was nothing we almost died  matt we sent men your way  sam you knew when the fight was  matt we knew when to begin the fight but we do not have means of travelling as fast as a dragon  travis im running around like a crackedout pcp addict in the background just looking on the  ground for /none/ booty thats all  matt perception check  travis one  laughter  matt there is snow and ice and its pissing you off  travis im doing the dog thing  matt more snow more and more snow in the middle of this conversation some of it starts spattering  the side of vex youre like stop it angrily ragelooting nothing laughs  laura draconia has had a history of separating itself from the rest of taldorei this is an  opportunity for you to welcome other communities to become part of the rest of the world  matt /none/ you are right no audio and from this i think we could try to rebuild a new home for the  dragonborn of wildemount learn from the mistakes of our predecessors and our oppressors we are no  majestic mage nation by any means but we can learn  laura you are strong  mat they are strong my time is nearly up but what time i have left i fully intend to make sure  that there is a future for my people for the ravenites  sam one more request before we go once were long gone you /none/ can feel free to inspect this hill  where the dragon slept and be very careful in disarming any traps that you might find there i  would ask you one favor for us we lost a friend in this fight a dragonborn hes buried near  here well tell you where we would like a proper tomb for him on this hill where the dragon slept  could you build a statue a fine statue a handsome statue of tiberius stormwind and bury  him underneath it and on the pedestal could you please write i encourage peace  /none/ matt she looks over at one of the nearby dragonborn this is korsa he is our finest  stonesmith i will see to it that it is done  sam teach your people of him your offspring that he was a brave dragonborn that wanted to  unify all of your peoples  matt this can be done sighs this mound represents the spoils of the remains of draconia  the dragon greedily stole hoarded and forced us to gather at the base of its icy seat this will  be the beginning of our new nation and with this /none/ we will make sure this statue comes to bear  sam good luck  travis where the fuck is it thats all you hear me say  laughter  sam what are you looking for  travis help me look  sam for what what are we looking for  travis just dig  laughter  travis can i make another perception check please  matt no  travis no  matt you can scanlan  sam what am i looking for grog what am i looking for  travis were looking for that booty  sam booty just dragon /none/ booty it would be up where the dragon sleeps not down here  laura theres some under the ice right here  sam all right i will peer down into the ice below us with my 21 perception  matt okay you glance down and after pushing some of the snow out of the way its amazing that  grog didnt see this at all but not really when you think about it encased in this pedestal that  vorugal had taken as a perch beneath multiple feet of thick locked ice you see an incredible  amount of hoarded /none/ gold silver platinum glittering as bits of light break through the  overhead clouds as the sleet is still raining down in places bits of it gleam and shift and  shimmer you can see finely crafted knickknacks and statues and gems and antiqued metals all  buried deep beneath this platform it looks to be pieces of ornate armor and weaponry all sorts of  a random assortment of items that are locked beneath feet of ice right there before you  sam nothing there grog sorry  travis no it has to be here somewhere  sam whispering /none/ just look right there friend  travis what  sam whispering right there  travis where what  sam hes my bff  travis i see it  matt oh yeah once he points it out you immediately clarify and the red haze that was  covering your eyes suddenly fades and you see shiny  travis can i use the siege portion of the titanstone knuckles and start smacking the shit  out of this ice trying to get down there  matt yes you can  travis just like smashing noises  matt yeah laughs  travis i /none/ deal double damage against objects or structures  matt yeah and as you start each punch the ice splintering noise more cracks begin to spider  out an incredible feat of strength and you can see the dragonborn take a few steps back at this  view and tooma is almost intrigued at this point staring with this grin across her face as this  symbolic destruction of what represented vorugals lording over their entire life is being ripped  apart by this halfgiant madman a few more punches through and a whole portion slides off and  you have /none/ to move out of the way you knock it aside with your fist and keep punching through and  eventually you get about over the next ten or 15 minutes breaking through enough of the ice that  you start hitting clanging starting to hit the actual outskirts of this large pile of gold pieces  laura wait grog can i check for any traps or is it like totally fine because ive been here  before and its not pleasant  travis i really wouldnt mind  laura investigation 18  matt okay glancing about best you can in /none/ the vicinity you dont see any traps  laura what about the gemstones those are up high im staying away from those  sam were outside the perimeter of the gemstones or the the main portion of the lair right  matt yeah the orbs are embedded in the top restful area the actual hoard is hidden locked  beneath the ice at the base of this large platform so youre essentially punching through  the bottom portion much like any sandcastle the further you go the less structural integrity it  has youre starting to make headway into releasing /none/ and finding access to some of the horde  yourself  travis we need heat and more than my wee urine can generate  sam i can give us a little bit of fire  travis yeah i mean or get keyleth over here  laura do you have dragons breath  matt she points to two of them and brings them over and two of the dragonborn step forward and  release this torrent of flame into the area that youve already carved out  sam ooh they can do that  matt yeah it only lasts a few /none/ seconds and it causes a portion of it to melt back but its  still extremely strong ice and it didnt have as much of an impact as you hoped it wouldve this  is very very sturdy white dragonconjured iceprotected walls  laura just keep on punching it grog  travis really  laura just punch it youre doing some good damage  travis but no fireballs  sam i have a fireball ill send a fireball over there back up a little bit  travis why what if i want to be close  sam well youll get /none/ burned  liam youre way down by 101 hit points though  travis i know yeah im still up in the three digits lets make it exciting  sam im not going to burn you grog just take ten feet  travis all right all right ten feet  sam all right ill send a wand of fireballs down i dont know is that magic actually hot  when it goes off  matt yeah its hot and its an explosion its not just fire its an explosion so it detonates  from the inside of that small concave path /none/ that you had punched through and as it hits and detonates  you can see the ice further crack the ice begins to crack even further and portions of it you see  a bit of snow bank that had gathered at the top shakes free and off the side revealing some of  the upper platform  sam we dont want to make too much of a disturbance here  laura no we dont  sam lets just take some stuff on the outside  travis is there any free platinum or gold or little bits i can start /none/ to put in my hands  matt yeah you can start scooping bits  laura you might want to ask tooma if she has a problem with you taking all of draconias gold  travis you saw what his face did didnt you tooma we are about to unsheathe and reveal a  great fortune of which we have very little interest because honestly it weighs us down  were like plenty loaded already however it is a tradition to take little bits here and there as  keepsakes  matt the spoils here were largely collected from the wreckage /none/ of our captors and much of the gold  here was earned through our blood and turmoil however we were able to free ourselves and have  access to this fortune a great deal thanks to your aid we are more than willing to divide this  between your folk and ours  travis that sounds most generous shall we look for specifically interesting little bits or just  grab the platinum  sam just grab whatevers closest and leave  travis are there any interestinglooking weapons or unique items that are out of the ordinary  matt make an /none/ investigation check  laura any lookingmagically thingies  matt make an investigation check  travis yes minus two 17  sam i will look for weapons of any sort ooh 30 investigation right  matt yeah  laura 16  matt laughing do you want to add your bardic inspiration dice to that to be a dick  laura inspire me  sam did you suck or something  laura yeah i only got 16  sam okay i will add my bardic inspiration i will sing to her singing something in the way i  wink inspires you like /none/ no other gnome can something makes you stop and think how did he get  so handsome how did he get so suave  laura six extra points so 22  matt all right there you go  now critical role owes a royalty to the beatles all right so grog you find a painted  gold war mask that looks really cool and nasty with the lower jaw youre like yes and you can  put it on  travis yep in fact i lick it knowing that its cold and i stick it to my face  matt /dung/ okay your tongue sticks to the mask  travis fuck and i rip it off  matt you rip it off all right you take a point of damage and your tongue is pounding with pain  throbbing as the top layer of skin has been torn off your tongue but the mask is still yours you  do also find a really beautiful black stone its really well cut and its about that big and its  really pretty and dark and awesome  travis i love stones im a fucking fan  matt and a whole shitton of /none/ gold and platinum you looking through you find a beautiful reddish  ruby gem that has this slightly gold refraction in the center of it thats somewhat symmetrical it  looks otherworldly almost its beautiful you see deeper within the actual hoard a ships mast that  was plated with gold that has been jammed in the center of the hoard wreckage that was dragged  here and included in the hoard you do also see amongst some of the gold a small vial with liquid  that is unaffected by the freezing temperatures around it  laura what color /dung/ is the liquid  matt the liquid is let me look that up  travis this is my favourite part getting new shit  matt it is like a thick syrupy metallic like a liquid iron a reddish metallic tint to it  travis i had an idea until reddish but i dont know anymore  matt and you find a pair of boots that are made from a very thick dark brown hide  laura another boots of haste for sure  travis theyre probably like elephant strength boots  laura definitely boots of haste pair of boots out /dung/ of brown leather you said  matt yeah a dark brown leather not very elaborate in their design but theyre well made  and seemingly have braved the cold weather well enough  taliesin theyre boots of taste that you have  travis i appreciate wellmade boots  liam and taliesin theyre uggs  travis do we have an approximation of the gold and platinum  matt well get to that in a second sam  sam im sorry who  matt scanlan  sam thank you  liam whoa what just happened  matt you find amongst this a /none/ platinum bracelet set with a gorgeous sapphire that looks like its  probably worth quite a bit you also find another unbroken vial amongst a series of other vials that  did break in the process of being hoarded here the liquid spilled out theres one unbroken vial  this one is a yellowish fluid with black swirls that shift on their own inside the vials  contents as you shake it you see they move at a faster speed and then slow down in a reverse  direction its a very interesting pattern  taliesin lava lamp  matt /none/ kind of underneath that vial you see a very beautiful  laura ooh sheets of paper  travis i love this shit its like walking into a toys r us its the fucking best its like  which way do i go  liam find the plate of the dawnmartyr  sam that was easy  matt there you go you find a gold and platinum band that is two separate bands that are woven  together like a braid in a band  sam like a back braid  matt kind of other than that it looks nice theres /none/ no other defining markings on it looks  like it would be worth quite a bit you do also as you rolled ridiculously high in pulling the  ring out and the vial you glance over and a handle is embedded in a large part of the gold  you go and grab it and its actually a pretty big handle once you get your gnomish hand on it you  pull and you pull forth a very beautiful platinum greatsword it has a series of small symbols  carved along the base of the blade on each side the /none/ handle comes a gradual upward curve it looks  beautiful ornamental like something youd see in a temple as part of a centerpiece but its  weighted properly for a greatsword and is far too big for you to ever possibly muster in battle  sam i cant use this so ill just leave it  travis wait lets not be hasty my god its beautiful  sam do you want it  travis im very emotional about this right now can i check it for traps  sam check it for traps  matt make an investigation check  /none/ travis natural 20  laura it is a natural 20 oh my god  matt you have never been so sure in your life that this sword totally not trapped  taliesin im so hoping it talks to you now im so hoping it starts talking to you  travis tis clean  sam tis clean  travis yes  sam you hold it i cant hold it its too heavy it weighs as much as i do  laura hows it feel grog  travis feels like money money money  laura speaking of money money money  matt /none/ as you begin pulling out these materials a series of the other ravenites start gathering  gold filling sacks and having to pass them off you see now two of them are pulling two big carts  over and are loading up cash in the area this is going to push your bag of holding  travis thats why i said we cant take that much  laura but if its platinum itll help  marisha more bang for our buck  sam what can we lose from the bag of holding  travis im very emotional about some of /none/ this  matt you get about 20 minutes of gathering gold and platinum pieces from the section you have  access to you could get more if you continue to dig beneath probably you manage to pull roughly  between the three of you 18000 gold pieces and about 12000 platinum pieces  yelling  travis forget the dragons lets go buy real estate  matt thats a third of whats in the hoard right now  liam park place motherfucker  travis build a fucking water park lets go  laura we dont need any more than this is /none/ really nice  taliesin lets build a condominium  liam condos in marquet  marisha parking garage thats where its at  laura how many gold is a platinum  matt for the gold to platinum transition here  travis its a lot scrooge mcduck over here is fucking swimming in that shit  sam with brexit its not worth as much any more  matt ten gold pieces per platinum  laura how many  sam ten gold pieces per platinum so thats another 120 grand grog vex we dont need to  tell the others about this  /none/ laura they dont need to know no  sam we could go to a warm place the three of us and live out the rest of our days  travis well build a bank itll just be us  sam theyll never find us we have the dust of tracelessness  laura im tempted this is amazing  travis right we kill vex after the first month  laura wait i can hear you  travis i was joking  sam we might need her to restart civilization  travis true true  laura oh you know what lets go /none/ back you lost me im out  laughter  liam meanwhile for the last twenty minutes ive been combing blood out of pikes hair and weve  been having god talk and as i put little fun buns in pikes hair i say you know sometimes i feel  like she is right there with me i ask questions and i know the answers but most of the time i  dont know anything does the balance ever shift  matt no not really its part of whats great about it is you put your trust into them and  /none/ everything turns out okay  liam that is so cool  matt you saw her she punched a dragon for me  liam weve got to find larkin though what do we do about larkin  laura okay all right  liam youre not here  matt i didnt like larkin very much its probably for the best  liam aye but hes out here on his own in the cold ravenites everywhere  matt dwarves are made of hardy stuff im sure hell be okay  liam youre probably right let me even you off  matt pained thank /none/ you  marisha what did we find  laughter  sam ten dragon scales the end  matt all right come back to you guys so vorugal is butchered in the center of the snow here  strangely as you begin to carve the air as freezing as it is actual touch on the skin of  vorugal is colder and theres a few moments where your fingers begin to adhere to the cold and you  have to pull back a bit but you do manage to carve from the hide if you can carry it properly  about /none/ 150 pounds of dragon hide  marisha oh jeez oh boy  laura how much  taliesin 150 pounds  laura we got 40 pounds of black dragonhide in the bag of holding  marisha well we now apparently have 150 pounds  taliesin were going to have to fill the whitestone coffers with some of this stuff when we  get back  sam grog is dumping stuff out of our bag of holding  travis so one black studded dwarven armor suit because pikes the only one that wears full armor  theres another full set of regular /dung/ plate armor thats going too theres a totally decomposed orc  head a brain chunk two dark elf heads one random arm a piece of bulette armor  liam that shit has been festering for months  travis twelve beef jerky strips are going  taliesin i was saving that  matt as youre doing this tooma is watching you going  travis by the way this is totally up for grabs anytime you want you say something to me and  well work it out  matt speaks draconic another dragonborn walks over and picks up the beef jerky /none/ strips hands  them to tooma and tooma keeps watching you all chewing on one  liam theyre starving  travis those are super fresh  laughter  travis im throwing out a greatsword and replacing the platinum greatsword in its spot so  that should make enough weight out bye black studded dwarven armor that was the first thing in  the bag of holding  sam by the way excellent notetaking and keeping track of whats been in the bag of holding  laura yeah thats great  matt well done  travis half of that body part /none/ stuff came out as gelatinous poo  matt yeah its the gamiest of gamey meat youve ever touched  travis just strings of you pull it up and you got to wrap it up in the string and toss it  matt it is why i love the word slough  disgusted groaning  matt you guys pull away portions of that kima helping out where she can the sweat beads on her  forehead even among the cold exterior shes a workhorse you also manage to pry from vorugals  mouth 20 individual dragon teeth that are harvestable outside /none/ of the ones the other  ravenites take for themselves you manage to get six dragon talons pulled from the whole body and  about lets see with all the destruction of the outside and there is this creeping ice thats  beginning to freeze the body from the inside postdeath the hide includes the scales you  have to pull off the scales and destroy the hide and any other organs you said the eyes you were  thinking about taking  marisha blood eyes  matt do you have any more empty vials  taliesin empty vials im /none/ out of vials  laura did you take any healing potions if you did youd have an empty healing potion vial  taliesin in theory then i have three empty vials because i did have three healing potions that ive used  matt well say you go ahead and recork three vials of white dragon blood  taliesin thank you  matt anything else  marisha no  taliesin im going to go sit down for a little while and breathe  marisha yeah im going to go into the mansion as well  matt okay so you guys go /none/ ahead and join vax and pike kima comes and joins you as well to rest  for a moment while the rest of the ravenites begin tearing off pieces of vorugals body  leaving the ribcage the spine they pull most of the organs out of it but the tree itself is  rooted into the ribcage and the roots reach down and burrow into the ground beneath it its left  this really interesting sculpture that theyve torn everything away from at this point now the  ravenites have descended upon the interior of the hoard and theyre hacking /none/ away at bits of ice to  open up more of the space beneath while keeping a very careful eye to make sure the structure  remains intact you guys have gathered what you decided to take from the hoard and are doing what  travis scanlan vex we should disable the orbs right  laura i dont know how to  travis just beat the shit out of them  sam wouldnt that alert thordak  travis we dont want to taunt him first  laura id rather him not know right now that vorugals dead because  sam /none/ he would instantly know that were not in our home base he could launch an attack on that place  laura yeah maybe lets not do that just yet  travis but what if he comes here  laura well if he does hopefully theyll be inside their caves i dont think hes going to  leave emon to come check out whats going on with vorugal unless he knows that vorugals dead  travis all right shall we check in with the other members first before we biggitybounce  laura well lets go back to the mansion maybe we /none/ can destroy it on the way out if we feel  necessary  travis what about that big golden mast you think theres a golden ship under there  laura what if theres a skyship in here  sam i assume it wouldnt fly very well but all right  laura maybe thats how the ravenites can get to emon if they can help us  travis it was made of gold right  matt gold plating around it there are portions of it where you can see the wooden mast with large  bands of gold  laura did /none/ it look like airship or normal ship  matt it was hard to tell from what you could tell it is a mast the airships youve seen do  not have masts since they do not use the wind  laura oh right  matt so it was most likely a seafaring ship and was torn asunder from a great distance and then  dragged here as part of the hoard by vorugal  sam what are we going to do with a mast  laura i have no idea maybe on the way out we can see if its /none/ uncovered any more  sam well stick a google maps pin here well always know its here because when we come visit  tiberius grave well also leave some flowers and take a mast with us  laura theyve been working on this for a while now is it possible to wiggle my way in and check  out the mast now  matt sure make an investigation check  laura 22  matt you push past some of the ravenite workers their shoulders dont give and you have to squeeze  through as you get there the upper part /none/ is still locked in ice and the lower part is locked in  ice for how much theyve carved through already is the central portion but what you can see is a  wooden mast with large thick bands of gold around it that are ornamental you can see within them  carvings and designs of a language you dont really understand actually what languages do  you know  laura elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic  matt you do not recognize this language but it appears to be ornamental and that whatever ship  this belonged to was /none/ a prized ship of either a navy or merchant fleet based on some of the marks  on it it looks like it was grabbed and broken off a ship looking down below there is a portion of  a ship that is beneath it as well much deeper maybe another 25 feet of solid ice below you with  the rest of this hoard theres a portion of this ship that was dragged here by vorugal  laura thats crazy its a ship im coming back out  sam all right lets go back to the main group and /none/ tell them what weve discovered  matt as youre hustling your way up the ravine to the east you pass by a number of ravenites coming  by with large sacks and chunks of dragon meat draped over them you can see the meat itself is  freezing the air and shoulders of those that are carrying it the essence of the dragons icebuilt  form is causing them to constantly shift it because its starting to stick to their armor and  you see icicles beginning to form at the outside of these large dragonmeat haunches that theyre  /none/ carrying  travis when you dryage meat like that salt it first then hang it just a pro tip  matt speaking draconic keeps walking doesnt seem to understand you  travis really bad sinus problems  matt eventually you make your way back to scanlans magnificent mansion and gather the rest  of the party percy kima keyleth and vax are all there resting and eagerly awaiting your return  taliesin ive got to try and fix my guns  matt okay make some tinkering checks  taliesin is this a misfire check or a tinkering check since im /none/ not in combat  matt these are tinkering checks  taliesin okay so its proficiency bonus dex roll ooh 28  matt thats your animus  taliesin yep thats fine  matt i believe bad news was also  taliesin yup 26  matt 26 is fine you manage to get bad news functioning again in the workshop below and  retort was okay right  taliesin yeah retorts fine  matt so as you all return and gather around  marisha keyleth has laid out the vorgual spoils like she got back from a yard sale  matt which /dung/ by the way is a macabre view as you walk in and theres this smear of dark purple  dragon blood and long haphazardly carved chunks of dragon hide almost like the preset green lawn  rectangles that roll out and smeared across the center of the foyer  laura i drop the bag of colding next to keyleth  marisha grog can you help me see how much we can shove in here  travis shit yeah  marisha here maybe like a sleeping bag and ill sit on it and you can wrap it up  travis yeah /none/ good deal  marisha okay well do that try and shove as much as we can  squishing  matt when its finally wound up it wont fit within the bag of colding the bag of colding is  the size of a relatively large satchel the dragon hide rolled up is about that big around what  you managed to carve off  laura ah shit what do we do  liam can we make percy some dragonborn armor right now somehow so he can be all white all  over  taliesin wow that would be a thing /none/ wouldnt it  travis how much do you think that roll weighs  matt about 150 pounds  laura oh jeez we cant carry that  travis i could drag it behind me for a little bit  liam scanlan do you have a room here  sam a room  liam for cold things you have everything here do you have a chilly room  sam sure in the kitchen theres a chilly room the mansion will expire in 12 hours though  laura we just got to go through the tree yo thats it  sam we could /none/ bring it into the kitchen for now  travis can we get everything else into the bag of colding besides the roll of hide  matt the teeth and those things can be put in the bag of holding the only thing that needs to be  preserved is the hide until its treated  laura what about the blood  matt the bloods been capped that should probably be put in there  marisha three vials of dragon blood in the bag of colding  matt yeah mark three vials of white dragon blood in the bag of colding /none/  marisha and we have six talons  matt the talons themselves are large claws that have been removed  marisha okay so we have six talons 20 teeth and 150 pounds of hide  matt there you go  travis yeah  marisha word  travis we got so much bling were stupid rich  sam a lot of things that we dont know what they are  liam whats that mask  travis i take the mask and like jim carrey in the mask i stick it to my face and yells  liam do you feel anything /none/ whats it doing  matt okay i need you to no im kidding  laughter  matt it is chilly against your skin  travis i feel like its making me fall in love with the first person i look vax  liam oh you dont want to fuck with this are you sure  travis no youre right i dont  liam maybe just a little bit  laughter  travis i take the mask off and put it in the bag of holding but we got this and i hold up the  bigass platinum greatsword  liam /none/ whoa  laura can anyone identify things in our group  taliesin do i recognize the text on it celestial  matt celestial yes you do  laura oh you can read it  sam when did you learn celestial  taliesin i was a very lonely child  liam its like latin in the world of dd  travis its like covered with prunes up and down the blade  liam priss whats it say  laura are you calling him a priss  liam laughing yeah  matt looking across the symbols they are specifically symbols speaking of /none/ creation  devotion the power of a deitys love and the unity between god and creation it is a very  religious and holy text across the blade both sides  taliesin this is some sort of paladin sword its a holy weapon of some kind  laura oh i bet kima would want the shit out of that  travis oh yeah is kima here  matt shes right now in the process in the kitchen of massaging some of the bruising and  wounds she took from the battle  sam got some meat tenderizer on that  /none/ liam couple of chickens on it  travis stop what youre doing i want you to get your hands on this big beautiful bastard and i  hand her the greatsword  matt where the heck did you get this  travis i could tell you but i dont remember  matt give me a little bit of time i need to see if i can make this part of my communion hold on a  second and she walks away staring at the blade without leaving her eyes from the scrolling on the  side walks quietly past all /none/ of you in the center of the foyer sits down with it and starts  meditating over the blade  travis i walk over and go before you hit anything with it you come talk to  matt shushing  travis i leave  taliesin anything else interesting  laura i found a jewel its red it looks pretty neato  taliesin how were the dragonborn about us taking some of their  laura they were great about it actually they were quite generous  taliesin anything else we should go back for as well  travis there was possibly /none/ a giant gold ship underneath  taliesin there was a what  sam gold mast underneath the hoard and also much more gold and platinum that we cant possibly  carry  laura wait it had runes on it as well do they look similar to the runes that were on greg  grogs sword  matt no the symbols on the side of weapon look like an ancient text theyre laid in a very  ceremonial format the text that you saw on the side of the mast looked more like an engraving  laura did it look fluid /none/  matt it was fluid  taliesin theres a ship in the dragons collection  laura yes i dont know if it was an entire ship but it was a ship  liam so you didnt go in you saw it  laura well i got down but most of it was still frozen  taliesin i think this would be a really good idea before we left if a dragon grabbed a ship  it was probably filled with something interesting it got his attention and he kept it  marisha it could take days to potentially melt the /none/ ice right  taliesin the ice is already melting  liam keek you could probably melt your way in there in 24 hours  marisha and i also have this my new toy  laura we should check that out before we go  sam are we in any danger staying here leaving our special hidey place unprotected  taliesin its not like anyone can get in here  sam no im talking about your homeland leaving it unguarded  taliesin its as guarded as its going to be right now  sam we know that raishans out there doing /none/ something  taliesin she was doing something previously i dont think that anything awful is going to  happen  travis i also took this little keepsake i call it stoneblack  sam because its a black stone  travis well dont fucking break it down like that  laura its so neat  marisha does it look fancy is it magic  sam why dont you detect magic whoever can detect magic  marisha i cant wait can i no i cant  sam i can look at it and see if it looks magical  matt yeah make /none/ an arcana check  sam ooh 20  matt it is not magical however your keen bardic eye looking at the gem it is a very rare gem it  is worth quite a bit  sam platinum zirconia  matt its actually a black sapphire an extremely rare gem it runs in the market anywhere between  four to six thousand gold  travis so anyway i got rid of my old saltlick rock and now ive got stoneblack here to take its  place do you have a pet rock  sam no  travis oh my god /none/ i sleep with it i put it under my back and it gets all the knots out  liam that is the cutest  sam do you paint a face on it or anything  marisha ive actually had a lot of rocks that are friends  laura oh thats great you can make little clothes for it  marisha yeah i didnt have a lot of friends growing up  travis sometimes i carry it in my armpit to keep it warm you dont need to know about that  sam thats very maternal  laura oh and these /none/ boots  sam leather boots could be anything  laura are they magic scanlan  sam oh sure ill look at those wow 24 arcana check yeah  matt yeah theyre very simple leather boots theres no real ornamentation beyond being  functional boots as you take a moment to look at them there is a faint shimmer to the leather  itself when the light hits it the brown gives way to a slight purplish undertone it looks to  have some sort of enchantment  laura does it seem evil or good  sam i have no idea /none/ however they look fancy  taliesin they are interesting and im indifferent to such things  laura i want to put one on  sam go ahead put one on what could happen were in a safe place  laura i just want to see what it does  sam wait what if its single use only  travis well nows a good time  laura oh no  sam its a boot its probably made for multiple uses  matt you can take a short rest and take time with the item to figure out what it could do /none/ if you  want to  marisha i attune to my staff  matt okay so you attune to your staff what are you unattuning from  marisha currently my ring of protection  laura oh thats painful  sam ac down  matt so all your saves are down by two your ac is down by two for now good to know  sam by the way we have two unused ring of protections that we can trade for things i have  one that i havent used in months  matt like stone of jordans now its the /none/ thing you trade props to you if you know what that  reference was what do you guys want to do do you want to take a short rest to try and figure things out  all sure  matt kimas focusing on the sword youre focusing on the boots  travis im focusing on the war mask  matt who else is doing what  taliesin is there other things  laura heres a beautiful red gem it looks special  taliesin does this actually look like a special gem  matt which gem is this  laura the /none/ red beautiful gem you told me about  matt oh the ruby it looks very pretty  sam ive got a vial with yellow and black swirly stuff in it  taliesin that requires somebody who knows things  sam ill look at that  marisha can i do a check on the potion since ive got alchemy training  matt you know what yeah if you wanted to take a look  taliesin theres some bracelets and such i thought id take a look  sam i have a gold and platinum band with braids  taliesin ah ill /none/ take a look at the backblades  sam the backblades thats nice  matt so keyleth was taking a look at the potions  laura what about the bracelet you also had a bracelet with a sapphire  sam i just gave it to backblades over here  laura no you had a ring and you had a bracelet  sam i have a platinum bracelet which i assumed was just fancy and pretty here look at that one  too percy  taliesin i think i can only handle one of these but well find out what happens  /none/ matt all right so as you guys make a short rest keyleth you identify both potions one of which  is a potion of speed  marisha thats what i thought it was the yellow one  matt yep the other is a potion of invulnerability  sam what does it do read it out loud with your mouth  marisha for one minute after you drink this potion you have resistance to all damage  liam godmode  marisha the potions syrupy liquid looks like liquefied iron  travis so you half all damage  matt half all damage /none/ for a minute  laura that is so insane  marisha and then potion of speed when you drink this potion you gain the effects of haste spell  for one minute  laura im putting that in the party inventory  sam no no no hand it out to somebody oh that one should go in the party inventory  marisha which one the potion of speed  laura the potion of invulnerability so we can decide later  liam thats for a very special day  sam grog could take the speed  marisha yeah do you want /none/ to take the speed potion grog  travis yeah sure i wont use it  marisha give the invulnerability to laura  laura oh thank you  matt all right the boots to you vex  taliesin so many things  laura is it boots of haste yells oh my god this is so crazy because i was about to learn a  spell for somebody but these take care of that these are boots of feral leaping when you wear  these boots you can instill your leaps with incredible bursts of power as a bonus action you  /none/ can attempt to leap make a strength check with a dc of 16 if you are successful you leap either 15  feet vertically or 20 feet horizontally  sam meowing  travis do you have to attune to them  laura it doesnt say  matt yeah those arent attunement  cheering  laura there you go grog you need those  travis does anyone want the potion of speed i dont want it to be just my christmas thats  amazing  sam anyone need the potion of speed  matt if you fail the check though you /none/ fall prone where you stand  laura oh thats important  matt strength check so youll probably be okay  liam most of the time but once in awhile  matt once in a while banana peel  laura i have a question because the spell that i was going to take because i still have one spell  that i havent learned yet is jump which triples your jump for one minute so if i did that would  that triple that as well or would it just be grogs normal jump  matt that magic would override the /none/ spell based on the enchantment its two different magical  forces affecting the same thing the jump spell is part of the enchantment that boot was crafted  around  laura oh so thats perfect  matt the platinum band is not magical  taliesin yay  matt but it is worth quite a bit actually the platinum band is worth about 2500 gold  taliesin thats a magic all its own  matt and the ring who had the ring  sam i have a platinum bracelet  matt the platinum bracelet was what he looked at right now /none/ thats worth 2500  sam oh wait the gold platinum band the band was a ring got it  matt you have the ring  sam yes i do oh its a thing im stuck here oh god  travis the cube shrinks to half its size  liam a centimeter  sam its a ring of invisibility while wearing this ring you can turn invisible as an action  anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you you remain invisible until the ring is  removed until you attack or cast a spell or until you get /none/ backblaze i dont need this  liam does it say attunement on it  matt it does require attunement its a legendary item meaning its extremely rare you know how  you use a spell and once you do something the spells gone that while youre wearing it you  can turn back invisible for another action as many times as you want for as long as you wear it so  situationally it can be very useful if youre trying to do infiltration or something  sam you can pop out cast a spell and pop back but not /none/ a bonus action  matt no its less of a combat benefit necessarily in some situations it may be  liam like going to a white dragon lair  marisha who wants to keep it  laura stealthy people need it probably  matt kima is happy  travis kima is happy  matt kima is very happy  marisha whatd she get  laura did you just give away something amazing  sam we can always take it back  matt as she stands up she takes the blade and swings it it hits the ground and when she /none/ hits  you can see a spark of divine energy from the impact she looks at her maul and goes sorry old  friend youll find a good new home but id say this holy avenger is going to do me quite well  marisha whats it do kima  matt to give you specifics it requires attunement by a paladin  laura oh so it has to be a paladin  matt only really vax or her could attune to it its plus three bonus to attack and damage rolls  hitting a fiend or undead the creature takes /none/ an additional 2d10 radiant damage on every hit while  you hold the drawn sword it creates an aura in a 10ft radius around you you and all creatures  friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects  travis kima is now an associate member of vox machina  sam provisional  travis provisional yeah thats amazing so the maul kima because i want to respect your  weapon what does the maul do  matt oh you want the maul  travis what no im just saying what it does /none/ or does it just beat the shit out of people  beautifully by itself  matt its my holy thunder maul it deals additional thunder damage when i hit something  thats about it  travis cool you want me to hold onto it for you or are you cool  matt thunk im good for now  travis boss total boss moment  laura she can do 100 pushups  travis thats true enjoy that  matt oh i shall  marisha i run downstairs to the training area with my staff  travis anything from the war mask /none/  matt no but it is worth 750 gold  laura whoa  travis ill unlock its secrets wear him down  sam well if were ever invited to a masqueradé is that how you say it  matt no but continue please  taliesin paper faces on paradé  travis can i get a description of it  matt yeah it resembles the maori warrior masks with the big open mouth the tongue sticking out  the two pronged teeth coming up from underneath its a war mask its meant to inspire fear and  give you an ominous /none/ presence on the battlefield  sam is it platinum  matt its gold old very old  sam does it go with his hat  matt if you were to attach it some way it would look very interesting  taliesin would you like me to attach the mask to your fine hat  liam to the back of his head  laura ooh to the back of it  liam so they dont know if hes going or coming  taliesin all right bring it downstairs  marisha theyre both metal right i can help you by heating metal /none/ actually  taliesin yeah lets just do this  travis can you also put my title on the inside  taliesin your what  travis my title  taliesin oh yes of course  marisha im going to go test this out and ill meet you in the workshop ill be right back  travis wait are you going downstairs  marisha yeah i want to see what this does  travis can i come with you  taliesin were all going downstairs  marisha its a free mansion man  liam you want to have a drink with me /tavern/  laura yeah sure  matt so while you guys go downstairs you two are going to the dining area  laura is there a lounge in the mansion is there a bar  sam theres mostly lounges in the mansion  liam is there an aerated wine cellar  laughter  sam its constantly aerating  swirling  sam inside joke im being teased right now for owning and using a wine aerator  travis whoever sold you that and said it was an aerator is laughing their happy asses off  sam i appreciate fine things and im /none/ not going to apologize for that  travis some guy broke that off of his kids toys and was like its an aerator  laura so yes thats where well go were going to go to the wine room  matt all right you guys find your way to the wine room scanlan what are you doing  sam a whole lot of nothing ill go down and watch the show i guess ill watch the training show  matt all right you four head down to the training room kima comes down to watch as well  pike comes /none/ down eager to watch what this new artifact does you head down to the training area  you have the big sandpit thats cordoned off with the wooden outskirts you have the various dummies  set up in certain ways you have the portion of the room that has the armor stand on the side the  weapon stand what do you want to do  marisha oohhoo okay all right everyone stay back im going to start by casting the lowest  level of spell out of it see what it does  matt which is  marisha apparently /none/ a fireball  matt okay at where  marisha whatever is further in the sandpit i told everyone to stand back  matt everyone stays back furthest part of the sandpit is going to be one of the various combat  dummies so you launch put the staff down you guys watch as in the centerpiece at the top where  that one gem is hovering and slowly rotating in place the gem begins to glow bright red from its  soft bluishgreen composure as it hits bright red this beam of familiar red arcane energy  streaks forward hits /none/ it and detonates into a shaking explosion destroying the wooden dummy and  singeing the one immediately left to it  travis whoa cool  marisha did you see that grog  travis yeah really nice  marisha that was awesome  travis was that the biggest thing it does  matt so thats three charges off  laura how many charges are there  marisha 20 and they recharge at the top of a day they recharge 1d6 plus four  laura oh how many recharge a day  marisha 1d6 plus four  travis so five to ten /none/ five to eleven  marisha because ive been really excited about this one im going to point at the other dummy and  cast chain lightning  matt okay as you do you watch as this giant bolt of electrical energy arcs off the same place  on the staff hits the dummy and the dummy immediately bursts into flames from the energy  hitting the wood and then arcs off and hits the two others suddenly the dummies are partially  blown apart on one side the charred section slowly smoldering as smoke pours up and you can  /none/ see bits of the electrical energy going crackling through the remainder of the wooden  dummy  marisha grog did you see that  travis holy shit that was amazing i kind of want to get out there for whatever you do next  marisha really  travis yeah just to see how much damage it does wait can you use this in minxie form too  marisha hmm i dont think so  travis no you think so or you dont  marisha i can try this though hang on wait that was five charges no sorry six charges /none/  burning through all the charges but i dont care  travis do you have another one you want to do  marisha watch this grog watch this im going to do conjure elemental  matt okay and which elemental are you going to conjure  marisha what elemental  travis earth big  marisha earth  matt you watch as she slams the staff in the ground and you feel this quaking and the sandpit  behind her begins to slowly billow and rise up as the sand falls away from underneath you see  standing behind and looming /none/ over keyleth this giant cracked stone earth elemental very much  like the form she often takes standing behind her its eyes flash up with a bright green glow  and it sits there awaiting her command  marisha then i do a bonus action and i also turn into an earth elemental  matt thats right because you got your forms back at a short rest  marisha yes i did  matt so now she turns into the same form theres now two elementals there  sam fight fight fight  marisha then we walk by and we /none/ top gun each other  matt each slam itself causes the air around to cracking like a small thunderwave in its own right  marisha then we both turn and look at grog  travis that was amazing  marisha then i punch grog in the face  liam yes  matt go ahead and roll an attack  marisha natural one  taliesin thats not a spell attack is it  marisha that was for me  matt and for the other elemental whats your bonus as an earth elemental whats your attack  bonus because the other elemental /none/ is going to punch him at the same time too  marisha he gets a plus eight  matt plus eight thats a 16 that does not so heres what happens in slow motion grog stands  there with a big grin on his face and both fists go slamming and glide off no impact and youre  still dumbfounded and enjoying the moment  travis keyleth  marisha gruffly i did that on purpose  travis can i understand what shes saying  matt no you hear rockslide crashing  sam wow she can become farsighted earth elementals  /none/ laughter  sam amazing  marisha okay i drop my form to hear what grog has to say  travis that sucked that was the worst one of all of them  marisha really  travis yeah  marisha did it hurt you when we punched you  travis no like wait is the beard all right  matt the beard is fine  travis yeah okay no its all good does it do anything else than whiff  marisha well and i tell the elemental to  taliesin no it does nothing else  laura nothing  marisha attack /none/ grog again  travis let me

help with the metals pliability go ahead and  make your regular dexbased  taliesin regular dexbased all right /none/  matt would make it strengthbased for the metal but the heat metal is helping you with that  taliesin all right  marisha big money no whammies  taliesin thats a 26  matt 26 yeah without an issue you manage to apply the mask onto the back of the helmet after  looking at some brief glances at the shape of grogs head making sure that it has a hinge so if  he leans forward it doesnt restrict or press into his back if he looks up it is a functional  backmask onto his delightful pointed /none/ helmet  taliesin ive also carved in elven in the inside kick me  matt on the inside of the mask  taliesin yeah so its there  marisha its magnificent  taliesin i think so  marisha shall we present it to him  taliesin yes lets  marisha i feel like we should go at this with a little bit of theatricality just because its so  much fun to fuck with grog  taliesin i know  marisha how do you want to do this  taliesin i dont know  marisha oh i turn into an /none/ elephant get on my back  taliesin did you say that before turning into an elephant  marisha yes i do get on my back  liam

matt you rolled a what a two  marisha yeah a two  sam its not going to work  marisha im a fucking elephant and its a door  matt its plus six because it has a strength of 22 because its a goddamn elephant so eight you  slam it lurches ever so slightly but that is a very strong doorway its almost like the arcane  nature of scanlans magic makes a good home  marisha can i try it again  matt you hit it again make another strength check  marisha thats much better /none/ 16 total  matt 16 it causes some of the plaster to crack doesnt get that much further but youre starting  to get a serious headache  travis are we hearing this are we hearing a massive commotion  matt youre starting to hear it now theres this low general slamming sound in the mansion  laura what is that  travis yeah do you hear that  sam i do doesnt sound right  laura should we go find out  sam i pull out mythcarver and run down the stairs  travis i take out the bloodaxe /none/ and i follow him  matt another strength check  marisha they get better with each time 19  matt 19 the door gets knocked partially off of its hinges and the frame is now slightly bent  forward the wood is splintered and the stone has more cracks into it the headache is now  pounding  marisha i should have thought about this  matt you guys hear another even louder slam this time as you rush down to the outside of percys  workshop you see some crazed large shifting gray movement of some creature on the /none/ other side of  the doorway  travis jesus scanlan is this one yours  sam no its definitely an intruder  travis then we fucking kill it we race forward and attack  matt all right both of you guys roll a  liam wait is percy still riding  matt you dont see percy because percys above you  taliesin am i aware of this happening at all i dont see them at all  matt no because youre inside the workshop and youre above the doorframe shes slamming into  travis 23  sam one  matt /none/ so scanlan you go running with mythcarver in the air and as you go to strike grog shoves  you out of the way in the middle of his angry grab and you go skidding across the ground  mythcarver spinning out of your grasp across the floor are you making a single attack or are you  doing a full round of attacks on this beast  travis this is a giant beast im giving it what for  matt so roll another attack are you raging for this  travis no im not raging laughing 24  matt /none/ okay both hit go ahead and roll damage on both attacks nonrage damage  marisha no go with it go with it  travis 20 points four points of necrotic  laura oh god  travis i know i dont hit lightly  sam elephants going to die  travis 22 points of damage  matt you take 42 points of damage from your maximum of 76 hit points as an elephant as all of  a sudden what little bit of vision you have through the pounding headache you glance through  in time to see grogs form roaring /none/ run up and slam his axe into you twice  marisha how much damage  matt 42  marisha whats my form  matt 76  marisha i fucking headbutt him im going to gorge him lets go  matt youre going to gorge him  travis scanlan  sam careful grog it has some protection magic on it it threw me across the room  laughter  matt all right marisha i would like you to roll for a gore attack against grog  laura this is ridiculous  marisha what do i add i dont have a stat /none/  matt plus eight  marisha 18  matt 18 no i dont think that hits you so you go ahead and try and gore grog and grog ducks  right beneath the two giant ivory horns  marisha do i knock down the doorway a little bit more  matt make a strength check  marisha okay 20 total  matt with that as you duck below the elephant slams through the archway sending stone and  pieces of wood flying and stumbles past you duck down to try and the avoid the attack going  underneath the elephant /none/ as it begins to stomp over you into the room you see this as you spin  around the elephant bursts in and it is very much an elephant you can see now with percy on  top being dragged through the rubble  taliesin im thankfully wearing a helmet  sam its got percival  travis roll off roll off percy  taliesin deadpan oh help help please  travis hes so weak he can barely speak  sam we must kill this elephant  travis we must destroy this beast  matt scanlan and grog what are you /none/ doing  travis come on buddy  sam we got to kill this thing  travis yeah you go come on  sam i will throw a wand of fireballs at it  matt how many charges does it have left  sam oh plenty i have only used one of seven  matt but each time you use it okay not quite how it works i dont think  liam just look at the shirt matt just look at his shirt  matt oh youre right one charge is a third level spell i misunderstood so you launch your /none/  fireball go ahead and roll damage  sam oh wait what is the damage its 8d6 got it  matt 8d6 keyleth i need you to roll a d20 minus one  marisha dont fuck me gil rolling your die wait a d20 minus one laughing six total  goddamn it gil  matt okay percy i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw  taliesin thats not bad thats 18  matt okay what was the damage you said  sam 26  matt i need you to roll a dexterity saving throw with advantage  travis /none/ natural 20  marisha im still wearing my cloak so do they get disadvantage on attacks against me because  im in the cloak of displacement  sam youre an elephant though  taliesin youre an elephant in the cloak of displacement  marisha but whenever i beast shape i absorb my items  matt that would have been something to mention earlier so going forward the attacks will have  disadvantage but you have to remember that for it to have an effect  marisha but theyre just now rolling  matt he hasnt attacked yet hes rolling because /none/ a fireball just blew up in his face  travis i got a natural 20 so im good  matt so thats half damage to you you said it was 26 damage  sam 26  matt so 13 points of fire damage to percy and grog and a full 26 points of fire damage to you  that puts you at a total of 42 plus 26 so 68 youre still up the elephant thats now storming  through the center hold on i have to go with the battle music for this now  sam wheres your battle /none/ map  matt storming through the center of the foyer is now spinning around flames exploding  engulfing percy grog the elephant is now covered in blood and scrapes that finishes your go grog  youre up  sam before im done im going to inspire grog and say grog remember they never forget  laughter  matt take your d12 inspiration  travis thank you ill take two strikes at the elephants ass thats a one  matt with disadvantage  travis oh well thats a one so  matt i know you still have the second attack  /none/ travis thats a two  marisha heavy footsteps  matt so as you go  laura wait its not a two  travis so the second one was 16 the first one was a 15  matt it still hits you rolled a two and it still hits because its ac is 12 its very big and easy  to hit go ahead and roll damage on the next attack  travis oh nice what a joy  taliesin its not hard to hit an elephant  liam can we also say that the two winos have come down to /none/ watch  laura yeah were staring from the top of the stairs at all of it happening  travis the first one is 20 with four points of necrotic damage  matt you only hit with one  travis oh thats right  matt how much was that 20 points  travis yeah 20  matt okay so keyleth you yourself take 12 points of damage as your axe swings through and  slams into the elephant the elephants form suddenly vanishes as your axe cleaves through  keyleth a little bit causing her to fall back and catch herself /none/  laura is percy still on her back piggybacking  matt in a second percy goes thud on the ground next to you  marisha pained noise  travis percy youve been riding raishan die evil witch  laura grog its keyleth  marisha oh grog thank you that elephant ate me you saved me  travis i did  marisha you did  travis sometimes i dont know if you guys would live without me im really glad im around  sometimes  taliesin i cant imagine it i legitimately cannot imagine it  travis ooh is that my /tavern/ helmet  taliesin it is  liam ayy fredrickstein the science guy nice job look at that that is beautiful  laura whispering hes drunk  marisha the elephant ate this too  taliesin its dr fredrickstein please  travis is there poo on it  marisha no its good  taliesin its clean its perfectly reasonable  travis ooh the masks on the back did you write on the inside like i said  taliesin it is engraved in elven on the inside its lovely  travis it looks like writing whats it  taliesin its your title sir /none/  travis is that what language  laura oh that its elvish  travis oh its elvish so not everybody knows what my title is  taliesin its meant to be secret  travis very smart did you see my title  laura i did its impressive  marisha i wrote it down  taliesin did you oh dear  marisha i knew it was going to be handy  travis i will put on the new mask slash horned helm  matt it feels impressive  travis does it  matt yeah  travis actually because now the mask /none/ is facing the back right can i fucking turn it around and  put the mask on the front with the horn sticking out the back like a big nike swoosh  matt you can its not as comfortable but it definitely feels badass  travis muffled i dont feel like this is the best  taliesin you sound very intimidating  liam he got polymorphed into de niro  laughter  taliesin oh my god  sam i feel like im going to have to write some house rules from now on  taliesin itd be good to have /none/ a list of things to ignore i agree  liam you need some of those blue guys with an aerator at all times down in those cellars  sam blue man group  liam one of your blue guys the blue guys that disappears with this place  sam my hundreds of theres no guys here theyre all female servants i dont know how many  times i need to say this  liam well nobody farted in our wine tonight we had to drink it regular  sam i am sorry for your loss because its really excellent once /none/ you let it breathe and open up  liam its pretty good right now  travis well now that i got my helmet are we going down to the ship  taliesin i propose that we have an evenings rest in the morning  liam we should go now  laura no maybe you need to rest  taliesin no i think we need an evenings rest  liam i have 25 hit points im fine  laura yeah well pike is resting because she was hurt quite badly  liam yeah but did you see her fun buns though /none/ i did those  laura i didnt  taliesin you did her fun buns  liam yeah i pulled little fun buns  taliesin oh okay thats good  liam what do you think i meant  taliesin i didnt think anything im going up  liam what else does fun buns mean except for little cute little hairballs on your hair  sam ill give you a book later  laura oh yeah you have a book  sam i have a few i have a library  liam oh gosh neither vax nor liam knew there was anything /none/ other than little cute hair buns  fun buns what is a fun bun besides a fun bun  matt	ask larkin  liam you guys we got to find larkin  matt okay all right so you guys take your long rest you regain your spells youre all full hit  points you regain half your max hit dice so if you spent more than half of your hit dice you still  laura do we keep our hit dice from our heroes feast if we never got rid of them or are they gone  matt no by the /none/ time youd wake up theyd be gone probably  liam can you use the hit never mind  sam when they wake up in the morning vax has a bill under his door for three bottles of wine and  vex for one bottle and keyleth for a construction bill of 5000 gold pieces  laura i promptly rip the fuck out of my bill  marisha i think its a scam and i throw it away  matt okay  sam it is a scam  laughter  matt all right wellrested a fresher day the mansion growing fairly /none/ close to probably  expending the rest of its magic what do you guys do  taliesin lets pack our things head down and take a look at that pirate ship then head home  well that ship i dont know if it has pirate symbols but im very excited  marisha so wait do we need things how far under the ice is it  taliesin probably a bit having the ability to melt some ice would probably be helpful also  youre going to have to do the tree teleport and possibly we want to deal with reforestation /none/ of  some kind  marisha reforestation oh sure because the ice age wiped out  taliesin we have to go out like captain eo its a thing  marisha yeah  sam just throwing this out there is there anything to gain by going up to the dragon lair  and communicating with thordak is there anything we want to say to him  laura and taliesin no  sam misdirection taunting anything  travis like you suck you can find us at the glintshore  liam	we dont even want to take an hour for me to slip this /none/ on and go see if theres anything  of value  sam up in the lair  liam yes  laura you can do that while we look at the ship  taliesin not a bad idea  sam but dont go alone you can still get hit with traps  liam i can look for those i do like buddies to go do you need to go to the boat  taliesin its all in the same place  laura yeah its all in the same place  sam i can hover above you or something  travis lets /none/ jauntily head over  taliesin if theres a problem we can call the others we wont be that far away  liam all right ooh i slip whisper into my pack and i put this ring on  sam whispers ooh precious  laura right so you have to attune to that  liam gollum voice nasty  taliesin thank you  liam gollum voice nasty  travis nasty woman  liam gollum voice shes a nasty woman  laughter  taliesin oh i may need a ringtone later  matt yeah all right great so you guys have put /none/ yourselves together kima and pike joined you  downstairs in the foyer you make your way back out into the ravine just as the magic of the mansion  fades there you can see most of the dragon bones picked entirely off the corpse of vorugal except  for the ribcage still remaining as a landmark of the battle that took place with a central tree  still sprouting from the top of it  laura is it any bigger  matt no the magic of fenthras creates the tree and it stays that size as it sprouts who knows /none/ if over  time it may grow you havent had the time to really tell you guys make your way  marisha i didnt know you are an artist  laura its quite lovely isnt it  marisha its pretty amazing yes i appreciate this  laura youre welcome i did it for you keyleth  taliesin certainly adds something doesnt it to the whole valley its quite nice  travis yeah green  matt the weather has cleared up theres breaks in the clouds its still mostly cloudcovered  but you do see glimpses of blue sky here and /none/ there still cold still see your breath out in  the air but the temperature does feel slightly warmer than it was the day before you begin to  walk down to the ravine center on the north side of the ravine where vorugals lair once resided  you can see hundreds of footprints up and down through  the snow through the ravine looks like theres been a lot  of foot traffic to and from while you guys were resting you make your way to the ice throne of  vorugal and you see a portion of it /none/ has collapsed inward but you also see a lot of foot traffic  around most of the ice spires that remained up there have been broken the remaining draconian  corpses that were adorning them were taken down or arent in sight and you can see there are a few  remaining dragonborn ravenites that are stepping in and out of the cavernlike chamber that you  largely punched through and they continued to excavate it into the night  taliesin if you could let them know that were going to make one last venture into the ship and  /none/ then well be on our way  laura i walk up to one of the guys going in and say in draconic have you unearthed the giant  ship yet  matt he looks for a second and says it is nothing for us but weve worked around it he  points down and you can see the portion of it that has collapsed filled in part at the side and  shoveled out in these large chunks of ice that  are sitting outside of this cavern area parts of the  ship have been moved around it looks /none/ like its been somewhat damaged its not a full ship its a  large portion of a ship it looks like in whatever battle or attack that vorugal took this ship  it destroyed a huge portion of it in doing so and took the rest of it with it in pieces and it is  a very pretty ship it looks like it may have been the jewel of a navy somewhere and here it resides  however it does appear like the ship has seen many moons since it was originally taken if that  makes any sense /none/ like it wasnt brought directly here it looks like almost a keepsake that  vorugal has moved from lair to lair  liam whispers oh thats legit  matt has some sort of sentimental value  laura oh wow it had some engraving on it you speak a lot of languages right  taliesin well i speak a couple of languages i read a couple  marisha what is it  taliesin does it look familiar  matt what languages do you know  taliesin celestial elven common  marisha sylvan primordial druidic elven  travis giant common  sam /none/ gnomish thats it  matt you dont even know common no one has understood you this entire game  laura pike speaks dwarvish  matt pike does pick up on it it is dwarvish text  travis i speak dwarvish but i cant read  matt that is a problem  travis i have a belt yeah  matt it is dwarven and as pike begins reading around it this its the name of the ship across  the mast which is the floebreaker this ship appears to have been at least in some way shape or  form designed /none/ as a means of travelling through very far north icy regions meant to break through  elements of heavy glacier flows and such the construction of it as you get closer to the  actual bit of the ship that is there you can see its very heavily reinforced with metal and has a  very rigid structure to it the fine scrolling that you saw before it looks to be partially  filled with ice at times so as soon as it broke away you could see its actually more of a harsh  broken dwarvish runic writing to /none/ it the ship has definitely seen a lot of wear and tear thats  about as much you can make out of it  laura can we get inside of it is there anything to see inside of it  matt you can attempt to climb inside if you want to  marisha how much is exposed right now  matt just the top of the deck and where the mast connects to the that portion is still  frozen into the upper part of the throne there is no entrance immediately visible but you can  break through some /none/ more ice or try to break through the actual deck to get there  marisha i cast a flaming sphere  matt okay a flaming ball begins to roll on the bridge of the ship  marisha where does it look like the most convenient entrance with ice and stuff  matt maybe four feet away from where the ice begins you can see there is one broken  portion of the ship deck maybe about a threefoot fourfoot hole that you could melt towards if  you wanted to  marisha all right im going to concentrate my flaming /none/ sphere on that and start melting it  matt okay its taking a while about how long does the spell last the flaming sphere  marisha about a minute i think  laura hums the jeopardy theme  matt all right flaming sphere up to a minute yeah the spell expires the minute done and youve  managed to melt maybe three inches into the ice  laura grog go punch it  marisha how much was it  matt about four feet of ice  marisha oh fuck that  travis ugh i got it  marisha i step /none/ back  travis and i start going rockyribcage on this big piece of meat  matt okay make your strength check  laura natural 20  travis 21  matt 21 he continues to punch and punch and punch and each one you see the ice crack pieces  of it break away you get quite a ways to punching through towards the direction that you are  currently melting before a lot of the ice crumbles and falls and almost buries you for a second but  you knock it away and pull yourself out of it as you /none/ do scooping the shards that occupied the  space where you were and get out of the way  marisha i cast a gust cantrip over top of him to keep ice from falling on him  laura i hope theres really something in here  marisha me too  matt keeps punching you get to one point and you hit and you hear a dull impact you watch a  crack spider up to the top of the throne  travis i think we need to go  matt portion of the throne above you is now starting to /none/ crack and fall onto the side  travis i start running out of there  laura we should get out lets go  marisha i also back out  matt okay i need the three of you who are closest to it to make a dexterity saving throw please  travis can i use my boots of feral leaping  matt you have advantage on dexterity though youll be fine  liam i couldve hanged back but ive been meaning to say  this whole time that i was creeping around the thrones  im just going to throw that /none/ out that im up there  matt okay so you see this happening a portion of it like a whole half side of it has cracked  and is sliding down into the cavern that has been excavated by your party and the ravenites  liam so if im almost on it should i be making a dex save as well  matt if youre almost on it  liam i was going to poke around and look around it  matt only half of its collapsing ill say sure go for it you who offers me to let you /none/ make  a dexterity saving throw yes i will take it  laura really did you really do that  liam i rolled a one but i have lots of luck left and now im fine  travis im not  liam so thats a 26  matt so yeah you manage to leap off and tumble in the snow to the bottom and dont have  to worry about it travis  travis eight with advantage  laura 29  marisha eight  taliesin 19 but i burned a resolve  matt so as you guys dart out grog /none/ and keyleth unfortunately are left a little bit behind you  both are pummelled with chunks of hard ice and jagged points of broken frost there dealing 13  points of bludgeoning and piercing damage to both of you and you find yourselves partially buried  in the ice that cracks off it you see most of keyleths body is currently buried just her head  and arms are out and grog youre about up to your waist now in broken ice and snow and youre  like grunts and pull yourself out  travis look at keyleths arm  /none/ laura yeah i see it can you get her out  travis okay i start moving the ice and pull her out  matt you pull keyleth out  marisha coughing  travis that didnt go well  taliesin lets burrow straight into the side i think to be on the safe side lets stop melting ice  laura isnt it buried completely at this point  matt at this point the entire excavation portion by the way as you guys came back most  of the gold and platinum that was in there has been completely removed by the /none/ ravenites over  time and this whole area that has been excavated so carefully left it in a precarious place those  physical hits by grog sent that whole south side of the throne to collapse inwards so its  partially collapsed theres a large pile of ice rock and snow and its not very accessible from  the current standpoint  laura maybe it was one of vorugals first kills or something and its sentimental  taliesin i dont know im irritated by it  liam i think it might have given him a little bit of juice when /none/ he was at home  marisha do you think it has some sort of icylike  liam extra ability when he was here maybe  marisha i could try and maybe now that the ice is broken i can melt it through it easier  liam why would a dragon keep a boat  taliesin why would he  travis maybe his woobie you know  laura like a blankie  liam yeah you know about that percy  marisha some people like collecting ships you know maybe hes a nautical kind of guy  travis yeah guns and ships /none/  laura he was a nautical kind of guy  marisha right yeah  travis hums the intro of alexander hamilton  liam while were all standing here with our thumbs in our butts could i look around and see  if i see a little stone a little palantir  matt make a investigation check  sam where are you standing  liam ugh luck again jeepers creepers  laura hes up top  sam if hes up top i would have been up there with him too  liam 26  sam im a crow circling around watching /none/ him from above  liam im invisible  sam well im watching the area  matt all right what did you roll 26 yeah you see within the north side of the throne there are  two orbs embedded in the ice about a foot beneath the surface previously you saw more  liam in the past in other locations you mean  matt no meaning when you guys first came to this when he wasnt there you saw three stones you now see two  but half of the throne has collapsed as well  liam and how far /none/ down are they under the ice  matt about a foot a foot and a half from the surface  marisha never mind  liam im going to go find my sister  laura groans its  liam hey im invisible here i am  laura and liam hi  laura did you see it it collapsed  liam yes i saw it i dodged out of the way  laura good  liam im right here  laura i know im looking at you  liam yes but im invisible  laura im looking in your direction  liam /none/ boop  laura ugh goddamn it  liam remember those little round seeing stones  laura yeah  liam theres a couple under the ice over there now i was invisible so i dont  laura you saw them under the ice  liam yeah  laura you saw a couple under the ice  liam a couple under the ice a foot or two away  laura where were the other ones  liam i didnt see any other ones  laura were they there before it collapsed  liam i dont know i was standing right beneath the /none/ throne when the throne collapsed then i found them  laura and liam were they near the area that it collapsed  matt and liam one of them was yeah  laura marisha taliesin and travis fuck  liam fucking  sam caws  marisha hold on did we maybe get is thordak going to we should go  laura fuck  marisha percy want to leave a mark anymore  laura we should tell tooma that  taliesin we left one  laura i go find tooma  matt the handful of dragonborn that were there after the collapse /none/ were walking back to the  internal cavern area as you head back a large portion of ravenites have all come out of their  caves and right now are in the process of scouring the ruins some of them are putting  armaments away tooma is out there currently conversing with a number of the other community  leaders that are deciding what the next steps are  marisha i approach tooma clears throat tooma its time that we make our departure very soon  matt very well  marisha i want to thank you so much for everything /none/ that you provided and everything that  your people have done  matt i wish to thank you for your sticking to your word  marisha of course i would love to help and leave some parting gift in any way that i can  matt the riches from the hoard will provide enough for us you need not worry  marisha what was your land like before vorugal got here i know it wasnt as icy and as frigid  matt it was without snow we are at the south side of wildemount i hope this fades with  /dung/ time we are not bound for snow people  marisha i can attempt to maybe revitalize your plant life as much as i can before i leave  matt you can do this  marisha i can  matt by all means we would appreciate it  marisha you have a good strong people and i want to see your recovery just like i hope the  same with mine  matt me too  marisha anything that i can do  laura tooma  matt yes  laura you know the stones we talked about  matt yes  /none/ laura yeah they got jostled  matt why  laura it looks like that ice wasnt superstrong and it collapsed  taliesin the ice was going to collapse eventually anyway  matt what does this mean  laura not sure exactly  matt okay  laura but you should keep an eye on the sky if you see something red maybe hide just for a while  thordak doesnt know what was here but if he realizes vorugals been killed hell come  looking potentially  matt but youre going to kill this thordak yes  laura oh yeah with /none/ your help i think just in case he comes before we get to him  matt you should get to him quickly then  laura good plan  matt good  liam the whole time shes been talking her braid has been going like a magical jump rope because im  standing here doing this with it  laura not the time  taliesin if you find something  laura whispers fucking dick stop it  taliesin if you find an ice weapon in that ship beneath the throne anything magical some sort  of ice power we may need /none/ it that may be useful  matt keep in mind for it  marisha i go up to the group percy vax i need to take time with this so are you all all right  spending the rest of the day here while i help them  laura of course  taliesin yeah  marisha all right i ascend to the top of the ravine and i start meditating and i cast plant growth  laura we all need to go up there anyway because thats where the trees are that were going to  transport through right  /none/ marisha yeah  laura we make our way to the top of the ravine as well  matt what level is plant growth  marisha third  matt 3rdlevel gotcha  marisha and im doing the eighthour  laura eight hours  matt boy guys  sam super boring day for us  marisha yep sorry  taliesin god i want to get in that ship  marisha i start doing that and revitalizing their landscape as close to what it was before giving  their no audio  matt it affects all normal plants within a hundredfoot radius so /none/ you have a very specific  portion that you revitalize in the ravine  marisha okay well i talked to tooma and find out where she  matt actually no all plants in a halfmile radius are  marisha thats what i thought yeah in the eight hour one thats like crazy  matt i should have kept reading okay so yeah you talk to her about it and she tells you  the ravine itself does not have the nutrients to support crops but we had farmland right  above the ravine  marisha all right do you plan /none/ to still reside there  matt once the snow melts yes  marisha ill do what i can and i go there  matt okay you get there and through the use of your elemental magics you easily cast aside the  snow and from underneath you can see where once there was a heavy amount of cropland that has all  died off because of the recent freeze that came with vorugal you take the eight hours to  concentrate and as you do you enrich the land you can watch as many of these dead seeds come to /none/ life  with green once more suddenly you see sprouting bits of delicious cabbages and other forms of  produce begin to spring to life and grow nutrient rich as this happens you can see a few of the  ravenites who followed you to watch this are taken aback and excitedly rush down to tell the rest of  the people the rest of you are bored out of your mind for the next eight hours  travis kima and i are sparring  sam challenge vax to a peeing in the snow contest  matt hes had a /none/ lot of wine  liam oh yeah that was last night  laura so youre pretty hungover you dont have a lot  sam distance and accuracy  liam sings a fanfare ive brought one from your house  sam its gone  laura it disappeared  liam damn it  matt yes as you reach for it theres nothing there  laura thats amazing  matt so you guys have fun sparring for a while you beat the crap out of each other off and on for  a few hours and you both feel good about it when /none/ the eight hours have finished you guys reconvene  liam vax your turn  marisha vax is shorter than scanlan  travis cursive baby  matt i want both of you guys to make performance checks  sam okay  performance for peeing in the snow  laura oh what what hes got a really high modifier though  liam oh im sure hell win  taliesin no youre going to win  sam not good  liam no even at his lowest itll be higher i bet  sam 18  liam 21  matt you want to add /none/ your d12  liam zorro  matt you can add your own bardic inspiration  liam yeah if he thinks of it  sam its a fair fight  matt okay okay  sam this is a fair fight  matt it is close but as much as your cursive writing was on point it was impressive that vax  was capable of cursive drawing the x stopping and then crossing the x  sam whoa  travis it stings when you stop  sam thats impressive but you know my wang is built for power not accuracy  laura /none/ as soon as the cube comes out can i talk to you do you mind stepping away  travis with the cube out  sam you talking to me  laura no not you  taliesin sure yeah im going to do nothing but stare at that bloody ship if i dont so sure  laura how are you after dying  taliesin im trying really hard not to think about it actually i dont know honestly there  hasnt been a lot of time to process  laura no there hasnt its a lot in a few days  /none/ taliesin i would say it would be nice to be going home except i know what were going home to so  theres going to be no relief  laura no not for a while i dont think  taliesin that creature hanging around  laura yes  taliesin yeah death was not pleasant  laura no i have to tell you something  taliesin all right  laura do you know what fenthras means  taliesin i dont actually  laura it comes from the elvish words im surprised growth and protection  taliesin i wouldve eventually looked it /none/ up its the sort of terribly boring thing i would do  laura its odd that saundor had it for so long since he was quite the opposite of that dont you think  taliesin i tend to think that many people tend to exalt the exact opposite of what they are  laura yes i dont know i think he focused for so long on the betrayal of his love on all of the  horrible things within himself that caused that that he became the physical embodiment of it and  i think he was trying to do /none/ the same thing to me even though i refused him i could feel those seeds  being planted selfdoubt and loathing echoing in my mind every night reliving every wrong that  people have done to me and everything i have done  taliesin i recently i will say before death had a  bit of an epiphany and have been trying  not always succeeding but trying not to  dwell on such things  laura thats actually what i wanted to talk to you about in the fight with ripley  taliesin yes  laura your last words /none/ to her were i forgive you  taliesin yes  laura it was such a surprise  taliesin yes  laura i pull out fenthras and i show him what ive carved onto it its sinaeth do you know  that word  taliesin how common is that word  matt you know the word  taliesin i would know the word  laura its forgive  taliesin oh  laura i carved this on fenthras because thats the key isnt it its the only way to really grow  taliesin i think so im trying its the only thing /none/ ive tried thats made any sense so far and  it felt very liberating it felt good it felt perfect and it wasnt about her it was just  about me honestly that was really the thing that i noticed was i didnt say it to make her feel  better i didnt say it to give her any peace i came to that feeling before running into her i  didnt know if it would be true when i saw her but i feel like so much of my energy had been such  a waste and worse than /none/ a waste it had been twisted in the wrong direction and its too late  for a lot of things there are things i cannot take back and things that i have done that will  forever be terrible but thats not the point i suppose  laura it isnt whoever that boy was that created those things that suffered such horrors that he  felt they were justified you have to forgive him too because everything youve suffered and  endured and created in that time has made you into the person you are now and you have a /none/ brilliant  mind and any darkness that might cloud your vision on occasion the fact that you found it  within yourself to forgive her means that it will never overtake you  taliesin thank you i would like to think were all better than we think we are except maybe  your brother i think hes just a mess  laura hes terrible isnt he just the worst  taliesin is he in here  laura maybe hes probably hiding somewhere  taliesin shouldnt have given him that ring thank you i know i have to forgive myself im /none/  not quite there yet but i can see a path i like where we are and what were doing i think that  were the right people in the right place and the right time  laura i agree and this engraving is a reminder that every time i attack its not out of  vengeance  taliesin i would be horrified if you were taking yourself too seriously  laura never did you see the bear that i carved on the tree its quite lovely  taliesin it was quite lovely i dont know if the tree is /none/ quite as happy with it but i was quite  impressed  laura thank you  taliesin thank you  laura thats all  taliesin what room are we in out of curiosity  laura theres no room were in the woods  taliesin oh no room were in the woods yeah all right as i walk away i walk up  i kiss her  so well talk later and i walk away  liam singing anything can happen in the woods  taliesin bless you  travis
