lets bring us into tonights episode of critical role  opening credits  matt hello and welcome back so picking up where we last left off vox machina having  defeated the chroma conclave and restoring order and for the time being peace to the landscape of  taldorei resurrected your friend scanlan shorthalt however he realised /none/ he needed some  time to himself to both connect with his interest in direction and life and with his estranged  illegitimate daughter kaylie upon leaving the party proceeded to find their way to close  all the loose ends that they hadnt quite had time to get to with the conclaves assault that  involved returning the ashes of senokirs wife to vasselheim  and then making your way to ankharel to deliver the hands of ripley to the scarbearers guild  on your way there you encountered a new adventurer taryon darrington  who was looking to /none/ join an adventuring group for experience  liam hes my favorite  matt yes hes the best he paid his way into your service and upon being returned to whitestone  you gave him a hazing which broke him enough to be a little more honest with his reasoning for  going on this adventure  laura lets not call it a hazing it was an audition  matt it was an audition it was a brutal audition  marisha singing dont call it a comeback  matt there you go in which knowing more about your new companion you /none/ accepted him for the time  being understanding the dangers that are involved in following your path and he accepted you made  your way to emon looking as a way to find passage towards vesrah the home of the water ashari and  the hopeful completion of keyleths aramente upon finding and hiring a crew under the captain  adella you made your way onto your new ship and began to traverse westward onto the ozmit sea  travis shit were on a boat were on a boat motherfuckers  marisha singing dont you ever forget  all laugh /none/  matt there is that  liam we are noble creatures  matt so  travis gasps i hear the ocean  sam thats someone snoring  all laugh  taliesin its a rainstick  matt so you guys have been at sea for a handful of days its been relatively uneventful  the boat slowly rocks as the waters of the ozmit are much calmer by comparison to that of the  lucidian ocean making them a much more popular trade route pass between the various continents on  this side of exandria now the slow rocking of the /none/ boat across the somewhat choppy waters  leads some of you into a relaxing lull over these days others into perpetual bouts of nausea  but you notice that captain adella runs a relatively tight ship her crew works like  clockwork at her order and the skies are thankfully clear these first few days and the  journey so far is mild what would you guys like to is there anything you wish to accomplish as  you are travelling across the sea  taliesin ive got a little bit of sketching and working on something simple that i /none/ might  even try and build while im here  marisha ill catch up on some reading i guess some of my alchemy reading  matt okay  taliesin stephen king novel  marisha from ive been doing trying to make that better  matt fair enough anyone else  liam i have been sort of shadowing grog for a couple of days  cause he doesnt have any gnomes  to hang out with  travis oh thats right oh fuck its real when you said it  liam i have been playing boulder parchment shears and telling him /none/ stories  travis the nonviolent kind  liam yes yes just hanging out off and on  matt okay vex  laura i guess ive been trying to get to know tary a little bit better  and also flying like vexkite behind the ship  matt okay and taryon  sam lots of pushups trying to beef up my pecs i also at the start of every day im going to  take two of those i have a bunch of silver coins that i carry around with me and im gonna cast a  couple of spells into /dung/ them just to have them at the ready  i cast fly into one and blur into the other  matt okay good to know  sam and then i would probably wander down to good old percy  and just ask him if he needs help with any tinkering  taliesin oh yeah no i wanna see what he has too  like theres gonna be some trading ill show stuff  matt ill show you mine if you show me yours  taliesin oh yeah  matt perfect so as the two tinkering nerds begin to reveal their /dung/ secret inner interests vex  you about three days into this venture you catch what looks to be a dark spot right on  the horizon midday maybe like two oclock in the afternoon its a warm sun this far as you start  moving westward and southward you head closer to what would be the equator of the planet  its getting warmer and the sea spray is coming up the smell of seawater and brine occasionally  meets your nose as the ship hits the various waves as they come across but youre still  keeping a keen /none/ eye out and its just endless sea in all directions you see no landmass but you see  a little bit of something appearing at the horizon  laura like land potentially  matt it could very well be land  laura i guess ill fly down and im gonna try and stay off the deck as much as possible  since it makes me so nauseous  matt so you just glide around the  laura yes  travis your imaginary character is also nauseous  laura potentially yes  travis thats a bummer  laura i know right /none/ vex hasnt had a lot of experience with ships you know  liam does your real self also get sea sick  laura i may have fed a couple sharks in my lifetime  travis she painted the ocean it was amazing  marisha ooh  laura im gonna fly down and tell captain adella  matt okay keeping an eye out and as you move you catch a little more of the shape in the  distance it looks a little small to be a landmass  if it is landmass its a very small one  laura oh /none/  matt but its stationary  laura oh it could be another ship possibly  matt it could be a ship it could be anything that would be stationary literally its only  because of your keen vantage point and your honed eyesight that youre able to even make that  slight little bump in the horizon from here  laura all right captain  matt as you fly down you see her shes at the front of the ship she has her one hand currently  on the wheel and shes looking out chatting to the side with one /none/ of her crewmates  and turns around as you fly down next to her shes surprised at your immediate appearance and  shes like oh gasps sorry i  laura youll get used to that someday  matt one of these days im sure  laura laughs  matt what can i do for you  laura i see something on the horizon do you know of any masses in the area  maybe a ship or island or  matt take the helm she hands off the wheel to one of her compatriots  and she rummages over in /none/ one of the small chests to the side  and pulls out a large scroll and slams it onto a table she keeps  maybe ten feet off to the right of her and she goes through and pulls out a few  instruments marks the sun and takes a good five minutes or so getting a really strong idea of where the  positioning is she looks down no not much in the way of landmasses out here my dear  laura do you have a telescope  matt she goes and pulls out her particular eye glass its /none/ small but functional glances over  and you look over in the direction and point it out theres nothing on the horizon  laura may i take that and fly up i swear ill give it back  matt theres a long pause  laura ive got nowhere to hide  liam careful butterfingers  matt passes it over  laura up  matt you take off look up extend it keeping a close view go ahead and make a perception check  travis first one of the day  laura screams first one first one first one which of /none/ you  travis set the tone roll like a champion  laura okay okay okay okay  liam natural one the spyglass has fallen in the ocean  laura shut up dont say it out loud  travis why did you go with the weenie one  laura shut up 21  matt 21 okay you take a moment and glance out in the same direction you were  and you scan past the horizon nothing  laura motherfuck well i come back down it went under water whatever it was does that  mean it was big enough to /none/ be some sort of sea monster was it a sea monster  matt i sincerely hope not for all of our sakes but nevertheless im gonna go ahead and have  the men man our ballistas just to be safe  laura how quickly do those things move  matt what things  laura sea monsters  matt depends on the sea monster  laura this one was very large  matt hopefully slowly and she shouts off full sail a bunch of the deckhands start  pulling the ropes down letting the sail come to a full flutter of /none/ wind itself isnt too terribly  strong but its enough to at least inflate the sails even further  and give a little more of a speedy direction  laura i wanna go back up and keep an eye with the spyglass on any kind of movement  that looks like its coming towards us  matt okay cool some of her men go over and start loading the large ballistas to the back of  the ship anybody else hanging out on the deck  travis can i run to the bow of the ship heading for a new /none/ land  laura oh wow  travis in new york you can no sorry  all laugh  travis on the bow of the ship  matt there you stand at the bow of the ship  you see at the very front theres the point the oh man  taliesin are you really  travis what  marisha are youre not  travis no im just looking to see what i can see like one leg up captain morgan style  matt there you go as you glance out with your hand above on your brow guarding the bright /none/  cloudless sunlight down upon you it is just endless ocean  travis is there one of those amazing naked ladies on the front of the ship  holding out the pole that comes out from the front  matt make a perception check  travis come on gil three  all laugh  matt its still hard to see from this vantage point youll probably have to climb out there  and climb down in front of the ship to see  sam hes in the back of the ship  all laugh  travis do we mean to /none/ be going backwards  marisha i go up to the deckhands who are manning the sails hi heard it was full sail full  do you need help with anything to do you need  laura wow  marisha i can make like wind  travis oh you can  marisha and we can maybe get there faster  matt the gentleman who is there currently wrapping a rope around his forearm as hes  pulling it down with his full weight you can see hes maybe in his late twenties though still  going a little grey in the /none/ beard for such a young age but his skin is weathered hes kind of  missing a few teeth hes got a large piece of like a bandana of cloth wrapped around the front  of his head and just a leather tunic he kind of looks back to you  um ive got it but thank you  marisha oh okay cause i can youre doing great good work  matt right okay  taliesin im gonna grab bad news and run up to the crows nest and see if i can see anything  matt okay  liam /none/ guess word has gotten around the ship then  matt yeah well she did shout full sail  i guess maybe you went up to see what was going  on you get up to the crows nest go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin make some room in here what is my perception thats 20  matt 20 okay you get up there lean out getting a view you can see maybe 45 feet up  vex is also keeping her eye out via broom taking her lead and the direction shes facing  you glance out /none/ in that direction but its just open sea  taliesin im gonna keep an eye out for a moment for a little bit  liam is tary down below  sam i was but i came up too hi hello hi i have one of those little sticker things you put  on the back for motion sickness  all laugh  sam one of these  laura one of those things you put on your wrist yeah  sam hi good day good day all  travis bidet  sam good day hi hi thats it  all laugh /none/  matt all right  marisha i shout out to percy what are you guys looking for  everyones so excited this is so exciting  travis why are you shouting we have earrings  marisha i was because were on the high seas and thats what sailors do  travis is it  marisha yeah see were sailors now  travis were sailors now  taliesin she doesnt have to know what sailors actually do  matt the shiphand whos manning the sail whos a foot from you right now just reaches up and covers  his ear and /none/ goes uh we dont really yell that loud all the time  into each others ear but thank you  travis yohoho and a help  marisha yeah  taliesin keyleth ask the captain if she wants to have extra speed from your wind  marisha captain  taliesin the captain yes  marisha i was im not talking to you anymore percy captain  matt as you approach from behind shes currently holding the wheel and she doesnt even turn her  head to you goes yes  marisha would you like more speed behind those sails  matt /none/ i mean always but  marisha okay and then i go back and i start doing gusts into the sails  matt okay gust is a whatlevel spell  marisha well its a cantrip or i could do a level three gust of wind  matt gust would be like a pfft its more of a heavy fart  marisha sorry level two gust of wind  laura basically youre blowing really hard  matt a level three gust of wind you said  marisha level two level two gust of wind  matt concentration for up to a minute /none/ so okay  so as you focus actually this is not a spell  laura were gonna be so fast for a minute  matt secondlevel spell and it cannot be done at a higher level  marisha okay  matt however it gives you a full minute of a very focused gust of wind of as it the sails  billow even further you can see the ropes tighten the guy with the rope around his arm  goes ow ow ow ow has to unwind it real fast go in and ratchet it to the side but the /none/ sails  pick up and the ship itself picks up speed for the next minute youve got a nice burst or  so you watch as the captain looks over the shoulder to you and gives you a nod  an approving nod wordless but  marisha captain  sam i turn to doty and i say take this down with an efficiency and an effective leadership  role model for everyone the redhead continues to propel us forward faster and faster to  everyones surprise and respect including the captain as the salt licks my nose and the sweet /none/  smell of adventure is in the air i know that with her on our side  we will be strong and we will be protected end of chapter  matt the tension on the ship  marisha hey look ive got rubber booties laughs  sam youre amazing  marisha arent i cool tary  sam yes you are ahoy  marisha ahoy  sam hearty laugh delightful  matt the tension on the ship slowly recedes over the next hour as there is no sign of anything else  laura nothing  liam hey man  travis what /none/  liam you cant walk off in the middle of a game of hideandseek again  ive been in a barrel for an hour  i fell asleep in there  travis im sorry i get so distracted did someone find you  liam no i just woke up in a barrel i dont even know what time it is  travis found you  liam touché grog  travis hey do you want to help me i think theres one of those wooden naked ladies on the  front of the ship but i cant really see  liam /none/ uh  travis wanna reach a hand around and see if you get a handful of wooden boob  liam do you want me to do a reacharound is that what youre asking me to do  travis i might not ever ask you again but right now yes  liam okay yeah this is not like the wood nymph never mind  travis no no no  liam i go ahead and do a reacharound i suppose  matt okay you shimmy out onto the front of the ship you do actually see just the cusp of what  /none/ looks like a pair of hands that are clasped carved into the top of where the wooden point at  the front of the ship is so there is definitely a figure there  liam yeah ill hang down  matt okay you hang down and reach as one would  all laugh  taliesin this got weird quick  matt as you kinda grasp over and hold and feel around there  laura this is so ridiculous  matt  not finding much in the breasts but you find a bulge it does indeed have a  figure at /none/ the front of the ship this one is not female  liam is it a wang  matt yeah  liam nice  matt i mean its a bulge where one would be

liam thats a five  matt thats a five laughs you hear this brief bit of tension sound of exertion  and then a splash  laura gasps  travis vax vax yeah okay right you fell off the ship right vax um  all laugh  sam first player death  travis i think vax may have fallen overboard  marisha grog what did you do  travis i know it could be a very elaborate joke but you know that sound when you deuce  and it goes  kerploop  all laugh  /none/ travis i just heard that and i think it was vax  marisha ugh  laura can i look down in the water  matt laughs yeah you look down you dont see anybody in the water but a moment passes and you  glance over and there up the side of the ship with two daggers climbing and soaking  sopping wet with seawater which has caused all of the heavy thick black fabric to just become an  additional 40 pounds on him you watch vax make his way up to the top of the ship once more /none/  liam this is the best this armor has smelled in weeks  all laugh  liam ugh i love the ocean  laura im gonna land in the crows nest with percy  travis that was amazing you are so drenched right now  liam im twice as heavy as normal  travis man yeah no seriously shes that stunning huh in the front  liam i start  travis i cant wait for the picture  liam oh yeah yes big  travis yeah  liam big  travis big booby  all laugh  liam thats you /none/  travis big booby  marisha i kinda do a quick like druidcraft gust and dry him off a little bit  matt okay its like holding a hairdryer to him just loud whooshing  all laugh  matt his lips are like pbbbft off to the side briefly  liam i shake like a husky a little bit  matt exactly  matt all right you said you head to the crows nest with percy  laura yes  taliesin yeah  matt okay anything in particular just keeping watch  laura just keeping watch  taliesin sitting and /none/ sketching  laura yeah  taliesin looking out every now and then  laura i dont feel as nauseous up here its nice  taliesin quite nice  matt all right about two hours later ill have you both roll perception checks if you could  liam this is the laziest day weve ever had  laura i know its nice  matt mmhm  taliesin wow no  matt days at sea its nice  sam meanwhile whitestone burns  all laugh  matt shh  travis getting flashes  laura and marisha no  taliesin to be fair /none/ im not really looking very much  matt fair enough  taliesin 11  matt okay 11 yeah youre distracted  travis oh jeez  taliesin im distracted  matt with your companion  laura 18  matt 18 okay  taliesin youre less distracted  laura uh pretty distracted for vex  travis is it clear skies or are we sailing through fog  matt uh no it is clear skies  travis right so we could just look up and see horror  taliesin wait what  travis what  laura were not having sex were just talking /none/  travis oh  taliesin just having a chill its just to chill up there its nice  travis oh right  liam just like a prom makeout thats all  laura no just chatting  taliesin youre just sitting and drawing in a basket  laura yeah  travis in a crows nest like a big laundry basket its just like  taliesin yes its basically a hamper  laura yeah  travis oh okay  liam its the most privacy youve had  sam any hand action going on  taliesin oh my god  matt laughs jesus /dung/ christ  laura no hand action no hand action  taliesin that got dark  matt anyway you guys due to distraction catch it about the same time the rest of the  party does as you look ahead and notice that there is a fog bank forming maybe  a few hundred feet ahead of the ship  travis called it  laura oh shit  marisha who sees it  matt well everybody does now  marisha oh everybody does now can i do a nature check to see if it looks like natural ocean fog  matt /none/ go for it  marisha thats not great 14  matt 14 it doesnt take much for you to realize that this fog is pretty localized its not an  entire bank that covers the entirety of the ocean in actuance you kind of travel from one side of  the boat to the other to get the scope of it its pretty narrow  and pretty focused in its direction  marisha does this look like something that i would have  like is this another druid doing a fog cloud spell  matt you recognize this to be /none/ of similar size although magnified  marisha bigger than us  matt a little  marisha than my spell bigger than my spell  matt bigger than the usual spell that you are used to casting but it does appear localized  enough to be of a similartype spell or effect  travis hey keyleth  marisha yeah  travis quick question is there a d decor uh like a proper way to announce ourselves  sam protocol  travis thank you  marisha well i  matt the ship suddenly lists a bit as you watch as adella is /none/ now turning the wheel and turning the  ship to try and veer around the fog bank that suddenly has appeared and shes shouting off to  some of her crew theyre starting to man the ballista at the back of the ship once more  laura is this normal is this a sea monster  matt um its fog  travis laughs  matt i have not yet encountered a monster that creates fog  but id rather not be caught off guard  marisha wait wait wait this  sam i can communicate with semaphore if thats something /none/ youd like me to do  travis whats semaphore  sam its communication with flags its a primitive communication technique that i learned  in many of my studies boattoboat its really helpful  i pull out a couple of pieces of fabric and start gesturing  travis holy shit youre that guy  all laugh  travis where is the other boat  sam well you just said to announce ourselves i could announce vox  laura i wonder if they can see through the fog  sam  ma  travis yeah we should have him do that /none/ you should go to the front of the ship  sam  chi  travis  and just make sure they know were coming  marisha can you do any flourishes  sam  na  marisha can you do any like tosses like color guard  sam oh no no  marisha oh damn all right  sam that would be really cool though  marisha sorry captain how close are we to our destination this could be vesrah  matt from the recent calculations i made on our map were at least a day and a half out /none/  marisha really does this look to be islandsized  matt shes glancing over the front and you guys by the way are up there in the crows nest  and one of the ship hands is now climbing up the rope net to get to the top as part of his job  laura its a little crowded up here but  matt  he gets up there and goes um  laura i hop on the broom and get out of it so he has more room  taliesin im used to this enough i know how to /none/ make room from last time i was on a boat  matt he hops in and pulls out his spy glass and begins looking out shouts down to the captain  captain its moving  laura its moving  taliesin its moving  matt and you watch as she shifts the ship begins to turn wide to move around and the fog  shifts to meet the direction of the ship  laura oh shit  travis smart fog  laura i just pull out an arrow and get ready  marisha so its coming towards us  matt mmhm /none/ or the ship is going towards it  laura im going to tie off a rope to the broom  taliesin not a bad idea  matt all right she continues to try and move around and the fog cloud shifts around  shakes her head and you hear as adella shouts out all right looks like were going in  be at the ready and eventually the fog bank hits the front of the ship and within moments  your visibility is cut to nothing  travis what  matt you can see no more than maybe a few /none/ feet past the edge of the boat and for those at the  back of the ship the front of the ship is obscured those at the front of the ship  the back of the ship is obscured it is a very very thick fog  that has completely immersed the outside of  the ship  travis vax dont try anything  taliesin everybody keep checking in  sam i will flip a coin to jumbo over there and tell him listen  if things get hairy you might want to use this  travis use what i /none/ cant see you  sam oh god shit  all laugh  marisha i do another gust of wind and clear the ship deck and clear the path ahead of us  matt okay they clear out and slowly the fog begins to choke back inwards slowly it does help  temporarily but as the ship moves forward basically you move past the area that youve  cleared out a little bit and the rest of the fog tends to envelop it  marisha im going to see if i can see what this is from underneath the water ill /none/ be back  and i swandive off of the edge and into the water  laura did you say it over the earring  marisha yeah bye ill be back bye  im going to do alter self to give myself little gills  and little fin hands and go with the ship  sam as i see her do this i am going to alter myself to have the same  marisha oh whats up tary  sam i pick up the coin and hand it to grog and say this will make you fly  and ill dive /none/ over the edge as well  matt okay tary gives a graceful if a little clunkier dive  in full armor which makes it hard to swim  sam oh shit  all laugh  matt but you can breathe underwater its medium armor its not too crazy youre fine but you  with a much heavier splash you look behind you and see taryon has met you in the water with the  gills also kind of extending out of the sides of his neck  i would like both of you to make perception checks  all laugh /none/  matt make perception checks please  marisha dont fuck me gil  sam 16  marisha it was cocked it was right on a 20 which sucks  thats all right perception check 24  matt 24 okay as you guys hit the water and go underneath for a second you can see amongst the  water which is relatively still out here and theres still the fog above  you see a slight displacement in the water  sam oh theres something in the water a boat  matt keyleth you look over and you can see the /dung/ displacement there is nothing dark but its  almost like something is pushing down into the water  or like there is a concave portion of the water  marisha but nothing under the surface nothing breaking the surface tension of the water  matt it is breaking the surface tension like its in as you glance over you can see  theres what appears to be an unnatural break in the waves like a path  laura like its invisible  matt its like another ship or something of that size is currently keeping in time with the  /none/ drensala vis  taliesin oh  marisha it looks smooth it looks manmade  matt well you dont see whats there all you see is the break in the water  marisha its invisible okay i come up out of the water and i  use my earring to communicate that to everyone else  matt okay  travis do you still have your fucking gills on  marisha its you know  i dont know do i  laura does that mean you choke  travis yeah are you like  marisha can i communicate  sam she has /none/ gills but she keeps her mouth and stuff right  marisha i can still talk  matt you can still speak id say once you break the surface of the water  marisha yeah i come out of the water and communicate it  matt okay  taliesin you sound like kim carnes everybody this is great  all laugh  marisha a little bit like linda blair  matt all right you guys hear keyleth begin to inform you as you hear off to the left side of the  ship two localized sounds it sounds like wood slamming /none/ into wood or some sort of a heavy impact  two in rapid succession and you watch as from out of the fog two extremely long metallic jagged  and almost like hooks or giant grappling hooks slam into the ship with chains behind them that  suddenly grow taut the rest of the crew begins to turn around and move their ballistas in the  direction of where the chains come from but you still see nothing there  the fog is too thick  liam im going to hide  matt okay go ahead and roll a stealth /none/ check  travis and we can see the hooks right  matt you can see the hooks yes  laura can we see the hooks from the crows nest  matt its just out of view you watch them pass through and you see them arc below you  and then vanish into the fog and you hear the impact  and the ship kind of impact noise from the hit  laura i want to try and hover down so i can see a little better  taliesin are you with me  laura yeah  taliesin im going /dung/ to very quietly say that im going to grab onto your broom and head towards  that end im also going to activate the spider climbing boots  matt okay  travis i would definitely like to go and see the giant sea creature claw  that just grabbed onto the boat  matt okay you rush up to the edge of this giant claw thats hit it and you can see its a thick  like a dark iron pole maybe about that long  travis oh  matt  its about that big around and has a large /none/ chain affixed to it that just progresses off  that side of the boat into the fog it looks like a series of giant hooks or curved spikes  and it has jammed and dug itself and dragged and caught on to the actual deck of the ship  travis good news not a sea monster bad news a big hook that leads to nowhere  laura get it off the ship can you pull it off  travis sure so ill try and lift the hook off the ship  matt go ahead and make a strength check  /none/ travis 15  matt 15 youre lifting right now and its not shifting unfortunately the weight of both the  ship moving forward the tension on the chain and the hook and the hook being so heavily dug into  the deck like versus that portion youre just not getting enough of a lift theres too much torsion  on the actual connection to the ship  travis you know what i want to see where this leads im going to leave it here  liam fuck you physics  marisha im going to swim closer to where the chains /none/ are coming from  and swim closer to the invisiship  sam i join her  matt okay  laura trinkets going to run up next to grog  matt okay so trinket and grog are now heading to the left side of the ship  travis hey buddy  matt you guys are swimming in the water towards that direction and you watch as suddenly what was  once a slight displacement in the water becomes visible and you see before you a smaller  more compactlooking ship but it has a series of iron plates all across it /none/ in various places  its armored from all directions haphazardly  not a beautiful construction per se but made for function  marisha im going to come up oh go ahead  matt you look up and from what you can see on the edge of the ship and you can see what appear  to be two small gray crystals that are giving a faint glow and it looks like they are actually  creating and emanating this fog that is surrounding the space  travis awesome  taliesin fog machine  marisha im going to come up and /none/ in the path as the ship is going by can i do a poof of faerie  fire in front of it to see if i can faerie fire the ship  matt okay well you can only faerie fire creatures in a small area a ship  marisha its not going to do it  matt probably shouldnt be faerie fire  marisha okay then im going to see if i can can i try and grab onto the side of the ship  matt with just your fingers its pretty i mean okay you know what i will /none/ say because of  the iron plating there is a little bit of a grip  marisha the seams  matt go ahead and make an athletics check  travis with your webbed fingers  sam can i join her on this  matt mmhm you can indeed  marisha natural one  matt you reach up and grab and about three nails snap  and you lose your grip falling back into the water  laura oh shit  taliesin oh ow  laura thats just mean  marisha that shit hurts  sam athletics  matt yes  /none/ sam ten  matt you barely hold on you dont climb but you hold on and watch as keyleth just  sam oh im alone  all laugh  sam do i see her in the water  matt you see her splash and disappear under the water below  the fog is starting to close around the area  sam shit she can swim shell be okay shes so strong and powerful  marisha do i see tary  matt you just went under the water you come back up and you watch tary vanish as youre now being /none/  left behind the ships are traveling faster  laura keyleth can you do anything about this fog  marisha yes once i track down the ship i kind of swim up and i say tary can you catch  this might be bad do i see any type of what are they called cleats the ship cleats do i see  anything like ship cleats right  taliesin yeah no thats right its the little prongs  marisha like the little things the prongs do i see anything like that i want to try and do  a like /none/ a grasp like thorn whip myself to the ship  matt you see one its a little ways up from where the ship is actually hitting the water  you would have to probably swim close enough to get there im going to say make an athletics  check to see how quickly you can try and swim against the ocean just for this brief moment  youre going to have to roll pretty high  marisha well thats not great just straight athletics  matt yeah  marisha athletics is pretty good 15  matt 15  marisha yeah /none/  matt ill say you dont fall too far behind the ship its still going faster than you and the  water is kind of up and down using your alter self gills you can dive below the surface to try  and avoid the choppiness of the ocean and you come back up  whats the range on your thorn whip  marisha 30foot range  matt 30foot range and it pulls whatever is there ten feet towards you we can say itll pull  you ten feet towards it so it gives you a slight arc but not /none/ enough to actually reach the ship  you can just cruise past the grasping range of taryon so taryon as youre there on the side  and you glance over and you watch as keyleth suddenly produces a large thorny whip a druidic  vine that wraps around the small cleat on the side of the ship  sam oh shit  matt and you watch as she arcs out of the fog towards you  reaching her hand out in your direction  sam i will  marisha tary  sam yes  marisha tary  sam yes grab /none/ my heros hand  all laugh  matt okay you grab her hand  marisha tary i want to apologize right now because in this moment  i am a damsel and i am in distress  all laugh  marisha so cross it off bitch come on  matt make a strength check  sam okay okay  taliesin oh please oh please  sam wait strength  matt yes just a strength modifier bonus  sam im feeling lucky yeah  all laugh  sam 19  liam hey  matt okay all right you grab her and /none/ you it pulls you from two points but you had managed to  keep your hold and grasp keyleth now dangling from your arm  sam i did a lot of pushups today ow ow ow ow  matt it is youre very sore  all laugh  matt you are very sore but you manage to get her right up to the edge of the ship and she manages  to get a grip onto the edge  sam i was amazing  all laugh  marisha you were  today in this moment for this 30 seconds of /none/ time  sam augh  all laugh  taliesin im gonna be in the middle of this for months  marisha you were a hero  taliesin im gonna be right in the middle of this for months okay  sam well omit that part  all laugh  taliesin did it leave a little stain  sam its in my nose  marisha thanks okay  matt you look up at this point and you can just barely see the chain and you watch as a couple  shapes just barely visible through the fog are now  leaping across /dung/ the chain towards your ship so  marisha i give a heads up heads up heads up people incoming forces coming your way  matt you guys in the ship you glance over where the chains are currently pulling taut you watch  as a series of humanoid figures wearing dark dark green and black leathers their faces  partially obscured rush onto the ship weapons drawn  im gonna ask everyone to roll initiative  marisha fuck i hope these arent my  travis right you ran into our ship  marisha these arent like my people right i /none/ havent found out who they are  laura i know what if they are  travis we gonna kill em  marisha no  taliesin whoa i dont feel good about that  laura look at that  marisha yay its a boat  travis boats  sam theres a boat  oh wow the topdown view looks so threedimensional right now  laura yeah really it does  sam its really cool  laura this is insane this looks so 3d  travis well done man  sam 1980s graphics  matt i cant take full credit for these /none/ these were already premade  travis aw  taliesin this is like the finest arcade that ive ever been by  laura this is so cool  travis which ones us  matt all right theres the two of them in the ocean currently off to the side  travis you dingalings  laura they can fly they can fly oh my goodness gracious  this is so cool what is this what is that  matt all right so up in the crows nest we have percy one of the other shipmates  kinda up there we have down /none/ here at the wheel the captain  these two wielding two different ballistas  travis at the bow of the ship heading for   laura  a new land  matt we have doty just hanging off to the side watching and trying to take record of whatevers  happening at the moment grog where are you  travis wherever that grappling hook was  matt that would be right here  sam roars  matt with trinket right by your side  travis welcoming committee  laura yeah  sam were gonna eat it  laura me and /none/ percy had said we were sort of on our way down  taliesin or actually we had sort of headed towards the other boat  laura yeah  matt right so you guys had made your way so yeah so  taliesin i was gonna ask you to drop me at the other crows nest on the other ship  laura oh  travis you need more iron in my diet  marisha these are probably the water ashari arent they  matt so you guys are heading this way are you taking him with you  taliesin if youre /none/ down  laura uh i was going to i wasnt going to go all the way to the other boat but i can  if you want to go with us  taliesin oh please  sam toy boat toy boat  sam taliesin and laura toy boat  taliesin and laura toy boat  sam tor books  sam and taliesin tor books tor books  all laugh  taliesin tor books tor books tor books its actually kinda hard  sam yeah  matt all right vax where are you since you are hiding  liam well i /none/ did a stealth check and i got a 25  matt right  liam i didnt know what the boat looked like so if theres stuff in the bottom id hide  there but if theyre gone i could also have gone up to the crows nest whichever  matt you could probably be hiding amongst one of the low sails probably so well say youre up in  this sail  liam okay  matt in that vicinity all righty so bringing us now to the initiative order  taliesin oh boy  matt 25 to 20  liam /none/ shit  matt all righty  laura oh no  sam yikes  liam knocks on table  matt 20 to 15  taliesin 15  laura 18  liam 18  matt all right  laura eee  liam yeah  marisha twins  liam wapetopetok  laura and liam explosion sounds  travis you both had 18  laura yeah  travis nice  matt 15 to ten  travis 14  matt grog all right  marisha oh 11 sorry  matt thats all right keyleth and then  sam eight  matt tary  laura hey /none/ look some things dont change  all laugh  matt nice  taliesin burn  sam stings  matt all righty so you watch as these figures just jump across from the chains that are lashed  onto the boat and as two of them make it across suddenly up the side of the ship you watch as  if a singular wave seems to water rushing and splash onto the edge of the ship however  as the water crests and splashes into the ground it forms up into its own physical entity  sam ooh  travis what /none/  marisha oh shit water elementals  matt youve seen this form once before that keyleth has taken  laura gasps  matt this is a water elemental  laura what if this is the ashari  marisha it probably is just havent figured that out yet  matt laughs where did i last put it all righty so that being the case im gonna go  ahead and pull these up there  laura did we say we did anything about the fog the fog is still there  matt the fog is still in this vicinity right now /none/ so youre under the effect of a fog cloud  spell for the area so basically the area around is heavily obscured so that will increase  uh ac to a number of individuals perfect all right so so first off this elemental  rushes forward to grog splashes around in your direction grog its gonna go ahead and take a  series of swings at you  travis sweet  matt yeah its gonna take two slam attacks that is a 23 to hit  travis hits  matt and an 18 to hit  travis hits also  /none/ matt all righty so you suffer 12 points of bludgeoning damage  thats full damage youre not raging  travis nope  matt and that is 15 15 points of bludgeoning damage  travis total or 12 and 15 both  matt 12 and 15  travis gotcha  matt all right that ends that guys turn next up is vax and vex  laura i was on my way over to the other  taliesin drop off  laura  towards the other ship  travis bludgeoning  taliesin as long as you roll by ill just let go /none/  laura okay  taliesin you can drop me off  laura percy wants to be dropped off at the crows nest so ill fly over that direction  matt okay  laura keeping an eye out for anything visible that i can shoot at  taliesin the minute i see a rope ill just let go and drop so she can just keep moving  matt okay so well say  laura flyby  matt as you guys make it onto the other side of the ship  taliesin you know you couldve spent your time making  two /none/ very complex lego pirate ships all week  matt youre right  taliesin im just saying  matt but i dont have that time unfortunately  all laugh  matt right so you guys right over to this ship here  laura yeah  matt you drop him in the crows nest  laura uhhuh  matt all right and you are currently on your bow is that all youre gonna do  laura im on yeah im on my broom im just riding my bow around  matt fair enough  laura can i drift down to where i /dung/ can see anything and i say to keyleth uh fog  can you do anything about the fog  matt on their ship  laura yeah  matt okay so as you coast down a little lower i want you to make a perception check  laura i like that one 31  travis jesus  matt 31 you glance down and as the fog parts you see on this ship there are three other  similarly dressed dark green and black leather humanoids that are now beginning to rush over the  chain and standing back on the back /none/ of the ship arms crossed you see a large humanoid with  a fishlike head it has no nose a big fishlike mouth big bulbous throat kind of a  greenishblue skin color very turquoise with big fin gills at the side and a large crest  that goes down the head but its wearing fine billowing silks and a large vest and its lower  torso from this giant oversized kind of plump belly the lower torso is just this swirl of water  that sits there and it looks like its currently concentrating  through the fog on /none/ the opposite side  laura oh jebus  matt it does not seem to notice you at the moment  laura then im gonna try to bramble shot that motherfucker  matt it is right there  marisha well thats pretty cool  laura im gonna try to shoot a bramble shot at him  matt go for it  laura okay 20  matt 20 hits go ahead and roll damage  laura yes okay oh hunters mark motherfuck thats okay sneak attack  travis its all right youve never played this game before  laura why i cant /none/ help it i get so happy okay  matt lets see actually roll again because in the fog cloud  you do have disadvantage on strikes  travis oh thats cruel man  laura thats cruel  travis laughs painfully dont do it  matt one  travis yeah  matt oh that sucks  laura thats okay thats okay im gonna try to do another shot  and in that downtime im gonna fucking hunters mark  sam yeah  matt there you go  sam turn them lemons  travis into orange juice  all laugh  matt /none/ so this entity is currently hunters marked and you can  take your second attack if you like  laura okay i cant do a bramble shot again cause that was wasted or does that mean does a  bramble shot only work if it connects  matt im gonna say for the purpose of this bramble shot cause its only fair and its a  powerful vestige it only works if it connects that should change the wording on that  laura okay okay im gonna try  matt go for it  laura 19  matt 19 does /none/ hit  laura yes okay 15 plus four lightning damage  matt slick  laura plus sneak attack woo an 11 for the sneak attack and hunters mark and then the dc of 17 or  be restrained thats strength save  matt gotcha  laura and im gonna do the bramble shot damage now  matt that is a 13  laura hoo yes hes restrained  matt go for it roll the damage for bramble shot  laura ooh is that a sev thats a one 16  matt 16 okay im gonna go ahead and make a /none/ concentration check on him he succeeds  with a 26 all right so the first shot whips past and just slams into the ship you watch as  this giant fish entity kinda glances off to the side looks down and starts looking up into the  fog cloud but youre right above it at this point or just off to the side and you fire your  second arrow it turns just in time to see it hit it in the shoulder as it glances up tries to  snap it free the wooden shaft of the arrow suddenly /none/ sprouts all these vines and thorns that  begin to wrap around it and it tears in its body and  its currently stuck in place it cannot move  laura awesome and i say percy spellcaster right below you fish guy  taliesin exhales got it  not sure what to do  sam noted  matt all right so ending that we come to vaxs turn  liam one of the assailants is directly across from me on the other side of our boat right  matt there is one crossing right now  liam but there is /none/ one guy who made it onto the boat  matt theres two of them who made onto the boat right there  liam right there im gonna attempt to assassinate that motherfucker  matt okay  laura oh god  matt so youre well say youre up over you kind of shimmy your way along the edge of the  sail and youre looking right down below him  liam okay  matt this guy right there  liam so advantage on this  matt the guy closest to grog or the guy whos alone right there  liam the /none/ one that you are touching right now  matt okay gotcha  liam yeah so that is a 32 to hit  matt that will hit  liam so this is assassinate its an autocrit  matt did you roll at disadvantage because of the fog cloud  liam well no but im at advantage because of assassinate so the first roll was a 19  matt yeah so youre fine  liam which is still a 32 here we go  laura i get 2d6 now for sneak attack  matt you do so roll another d6  laura /none/ another six  matt nice  taliesin hey that die  matt thats 48 points of damage in one hit  laura bramble shot motherfucker  liam doing my maths over here 32 36 72 thats 80 points of damage  matt 80 points of damage  travis what the fuck no wonder tary almost died  liam is he still standing  matt no  all laugh  travis assassinate  matt just leaps off the chain and pulls out what looks like for this it would be a dagger and a  rapier glances around and goes lunging /none/ in for the captain of the ship gets maybe two steps  before your blade sinks into the back of the neck and he just hits the side and collapses  right at the edge of the ship right there done  liam okay just for funsies i will throw my second dagger at the one right in front of trink  matt okay  liam so that is not that good  laura ooh  liam thats a 13  matt okay yeah even with disadvantage okay so this one you fire and just disappears off to  the /none/ side of the ship but returns to your belt are you gonna stay where you are  liam no im gonna drop down  matt okay  liam and circle around trinkets tush  matt all right make an acrobatics check  liam sure  matt just to land from the top there  liam yeah 25  matt yeah youre fine so you move around behind trinket all righty  that ends your turn vax  percy youre up  taliesin okay im gonna take a quick look around to see if i can figure out whats causing this fog /none/  because its annoying me  matt perception check  taliesin thats a 19  matt glancing about in the area its hard to see especially from this vantage point  the area is so heavily obscured with fog you do glance and see what looks to be a very  very faint general glow in a lower area towards the edge of the ship  but thats all you can make out  taliesin starboard port  matt itd be on this side  taliesin all right  somebody take a look at anything theres a glow coming from /none/ the starboard side of the enemy ship  its the one closest to our ship we need to find out whats causing this fog in the meantime  im gonna slowly make my way down a couple of the ropes is that an enemy right there that guy  matt youre up here  taliesin yeah i know im asking if thats an enemy on our ship right there  matt this is an enemy right there  marisha the water elemental  matt these are enemies these are your guys the guys with the red cloaks the red color /none/  signifies your own crewmates  taliesin okay so we have two enemies that are currently on their ship  matt two enemies in their ship one thats currently crossing  and one that is on the other side  taliesin okay im gonna slowly start making my way just maybe a few feet down and im going to  shoot those two people who are on the very edge both of them in the back  sam theres no honor in that  taliesin no there is on the other hand fine comedy about to happen  sam true /none/ true  taliesin im gonna very very carefully and im at disadvantage with this  matt disadvantage with each strike yes  taliesin oh thats annoying okay im gonna use the pepperbox the animus  and im also going to burn a grit for a push  matt for which one of these guys  taliesin what about one on each  matt one of these two  taliesin both of them ill start with the first one and work my way down  matt okay first one there  taliesin all right so lets see what happens  marisha /none/ big money no whammies  taliesin that will do thats a 28  matt 28 will hit  taliesin and thats im sorry you know why im a little confused  i just had to switch again thats wow  marisha thats good  taliesin  thats good thats 17 points of damage and five points of psychic damage  matt nice  taliesin and he goes ten feet away from me  travis ah  laura oh  marisha yelps  taliesin laughs  matt as hes trying to step across the chain  liam wilhelm scream  matt /none/ gunshot  marisha wilhelm screams  matt he gets blasted and wilhelm scream just plunges off the side of the chain loses his footing  tumbles over and vanishes into the fog and you hear this splash a moment later  taliesin next i love boats  matt so this guy disadvantage on this shot  taliesin yep here we go thats oh thats good 29 im rolling really well  matt yeah that will hit  taliesin not as well as yesterday but really well  marisha singing i got a nautical themed pashmina afghan  taliesin and thats /none/ five six thats 11 points of damage and five points of psychic damage  and a tenfoot push  matt all righty okay he also snapping sound falls off grabs the chain catches it with his  finger but because of the sea spray and the fog its too slick and  slipping sound wilhelm scream just falls  taliesin i was just gonna say hes happy to grab and ill deal with that too  matt yeah but they both have fallen off the ship  marisha thats what she said no  taliesin i can make him drop /none/ things i have that power  marisha oh my god drop the chain theyre holding on to  taliesin ive been wanting to watch somebody holding on and make them drop it ive been  wanting to do that for like probably a year and a half now  god is there anybody fun on our side  laura the fish guy  taliesin youve got him grappled  matt youve one guy walking across right now on the chain and the guy below you who is grappled  and the water elemental thats also attacking you  travis yeah /none/ dont you get advantage on grappled guy  taliesin technically i would that would cancel out wouldnt it  matt he is restrained which means attacks on him are with advantage so it would cancel it out  taliesin it would cancel it out automatically oh in that case im gonna take a shot on him  laura and itll probably get a chance to be unrestrained as soon as its his turn  taliesin okay good point so im gonna take a sharpshooter shot  im also going to is he holding anything  matt not that you can /none/ see  taliesin thats good and hes a magic yeah that will do ill just take a good oldfashioned  sharpshooter shot so thats thats not as good thats 18 to hit  matt 18 to hit just barely hits  taliesin oh thank god okay  liam i hope these arent your cousins  marisha they might be  taliesin well they were a little  travis nobodys tried talking yet  marisha well figure that out  laura were kind of being ambushed so  taliesin thats kind of heavy thats gonna be 24 points of damage  /none/ and three points of psychic damage  laura i dont think your cousins are fish people  marisha my cousins might be fish men  liam they could be werefish or  marisha they could be anybody they could be werefish  matt gotcha okay so you managed to fire gunshot the third shot out from animus  you see it blasts into the upper shoulder and back portion of this fishlike creature  growls it does not look terribly happy but it is currently still bound by the various  thorny vines that have wrapped around it end your /none/ turn  taliesin yeah and im just gonna crawl a couple feet into the ropes in that direction  matt okay  taliesin im just gonna keep ropeswinging there we are  matt there you go all righty that brings us to grog  travis after getting hit by the water elemental can i go hey what do you want  matt the water elemental just gurgling growls  travis fuck it you got saltwater in my eyes i would like to rage  matt okay  travis i go into a rage  marisha its not me grog its /none/ not me  travis oh i hadnt thought about that  all laugh  travis and i beat the shit out of it with the dwarven hammer two hits  matt go for it two strikes  travis are these at disadvantage or im right up there  matt no youre melee youre fine  travis hey reckless attack  matt okay  laura oh my  liam hells yeah  travis 23  matt that hits  travis nice 17  matt 17 damage okay now your last strike  travis god those are balls theyre not literal balls /none/ 22  matt that hits  laura nice  travis 24 24 points of damage  matt 24 points of damage okay nice so you start bludgeoning its watery form even though you  see the water splashing around and its soaking everything in the vicinity you are still watching  as each blow forces the creature to kinda shift and move and you hear this gurgling sound kind  of dull thud sound and a pained noise seems to emit from  this elemental creature with each impact  travis you can do better than that  matt does /none/ that end your turn  travis yeah  matt all righty that brings us to the rest of the crew so these guys the water has now pushed  them past a bit they are moved and theyre starting to try and swim their way to the edge of  the ship and theyre starting to actually lets see what their rolls are for their athletics  natural 20 nice okay so they both make their way up to the side of this side of the ship and  latch onto the edge right beside keyleth and taryon  sam /none/ oh great  marisha can i say something to him  matt yeah as both grunts get out of the water theyre  pulling up right alongside you pulling  blades out  marisha hi kaitiyaki water ashari  matt you hear them just growl as they pull their blades out and continue  marisha hm hm  liam kick his ass  travis yeah we tried to talk  matt so for this one each of them are gonna make two strikes  against each of you with their rapiers  sam oh great  matt taryon that is /none/ a 21  sam yeah  matt and a 21  sam yeah  matt i rolled the same number twice in a row so you take  travis whats your ac there big guy  sam 15  matt nine points of piercing damage and five points of piercing damage  sam sure  matt as it just thrust  sam ow  matt  holding onto the side of the ships armor thrusting the rapier into you scraping  past your armor one catches you in the hip  sam ugh  travis ooh  matt keyleth the /none/ other ones gonna make two strikes against you thats gonna be  marisha cousins  matt an eight  marisha no oh nope that misses  matt and a 27  marisha yeah  matt and thats gonna hit you for ten points of piercing damage  marisha okay thats yeah  matt and it looks like their ascent has stopped and theyre just right now happy to just continue  to pierce these two stowaways that are gripping onto the side of the ship this one stumbles  across the rest of the chain and turning and seeing you /none/ guys there on the edge vax as you dart  around the side of trinket its gonna move avoid the bear step across and attempt to  attack you twice with the rapier once with the dagger  liam sure  marisha jeez louise  matt so the daggers gonna be 11  liam no  matt not very good  liam thats a no  matt however that is a 26  liam that hits uncanny dodge  matt and a 19  liam no  matt no all right so they get one rapier strike towards you that /none/ is going to be nine  points of piercing damage  liam halved  matt as it just cuts across the center of your armor in the midsection it doesnt actually get  the skin but its enough of an impact where you can feel a bruise coming  liam tight  matt all righty ending their turn that brings us to keyleth  marisha okay am i still on the side of the boat  matt you are yes  marisha im gonna climb up that boat  matt okay make an athletics check  marisha ooh thats good /none/ 17 plus my athletics which is good which is seven so 24  matt okay so you get up on the edge of the ship it does get one attack of opportunity against you  as you move up its gonna slice at you with a rapier that is gonna be an 18  marisha miss  sam whoa  matt nice  marisha no hit sorry  matt okay there you go thats all good  that is ten points piercing damage  marisha okay  matt as the rapier just catches you in the back and youre like /none/ groans and you climb up and  get back onto the edge of the ship as you glance around you can see that there is the weird  fishlooking guy in the center of the ship right now its currently bound by the vines around him  marisha any sign that these could still be my people pretty certain theyre not  travis i think you can let that go now  matt youre pretty sure theres not much of a tribal sign  marisha nothing  matt  that resembles anything asharirelated universally  marisha guys real pirates  /none/ and then im going to do control water and im going to raise water 20 feet around me and start  sinking this bitch i want to sink this ship 20 feet  just tidal waves coming over the boat and im sinking it  travis oh shit  matt control water what level is this  marisha fourth level  laura we could steal this ship okay  taliesin it might have stuff  marisha nope im sinking it  matt okay as you get on the edge you begin to pull your arms up and as you do /none/ you hands begin  to glow with a dull blueturquoise color similar to the skin of this fishlike creature  and it glances over at you and its jaw opens you can see this burbling sound as the edges of  the water begin to rise up and splash and pour into the ship perpetually filling the lower  usually airfilled section of this ship and it begins to immediately  thud list a little bit to one side  marisha do i have any movement or is that it probably getting up is my movement  matt thats gonna /none/ be your action and climbing up is gonna be your movement  so thats kinda where you are  marisha okay cool  matt you can maintain concentration on it  taliesin were gonna want to break the chains  marisha i maintain concentration  matt you get the sense its gonna take a few rounds but if you keep at this youll probably  have a  good chance of achieving your goal  marisha cool its what i like to hear in life in general  laura you might bring our ship down with it keyleth  travis if /none/ you keep at it you might be able to achieve your goal  marisha no its localized  laura no but the chains attaching two ships  marisha eh weve got time  taliesin thats the correct response  liam she says as she destroys everything  travis yep yeah yep  marisha destroy reality  matt ending keyleths turn it is now the crews go so the crew here is gonna turn the ballistas  around as the captain leaps off down and goes behind the guy who attacked you vax she pulls  out a scimitar rushes forward /none/ screaming yah  and just does a full downward arc into the back  laura oh shit  liam adele dazeem ladies and gentlemen  laura

one is a natural 20  travis boom  laura damn  matt oof thats gonna be nasty that yeah okay  travis wow  matt that is 42 points of damage  travis damn from one of the ballistas  matt  to the side of /none/ the ship you watch as one of these ballistas has a similarlooking like  giant iron arrow but its designed to just split and destroy wood on impact its pierced  but it seems to splinter out so it hits and then breaks as it goes  travis oh shit  matt and as it slams into the side of this ship just above where taryon and the other guy  are you watch as it crashing sound slams and wood splinters and breaks the impact shakes the  side im actually gonna ask both you and that guy to /none/ make a strength saving throw  travis come on buddy  sam thats sorta cocked but thats okay ill take it thats a five  matt okay both of you guys  sam maybe ill use luck and go again  matt okay go for it  sam ooh yeah yeah thats ten  matt okay thats two thats enough to hold on the other guy did not make it so you just hold  on from the impact the other guy screams falls back and splashes into  sam you shouldve worn boat shoes  all laugh  matt /none/ perfect  laura i like to picture you in full armor with boat shoes on  marisha boat shoes on  matt as you hold on you watch as the ballista which has a chain attached to the back of it as  well is now being ratcheted back and as it slams through and is pulled back its tearing sections  of the ship apart and you can watch now as its  pulling down and breaking a whole section  sam jesus  matt thats gonna go ahead and end this crewmans turn this guy is gonna go /none/ ahead  crossbow and try to line it up towards i can only see the guy below with disadvantage  oh its a shame its a natural 20 and a 19 actually still manages to hit even with the  disadvantage from the fog cloud okay thats eight damage to that guy all righty and then  this guy over here is gonna move to the water elemental and take a strike on it and misses  whoosh it goes and strikes but the water elemental shifts out of the way the blade moves  past without an impact end /none/ of the round we have taryon  sam yeah  marisha taryon  sam yeah so the guy

into the ship below  sam so cool so cool okay i just yell back to doty get rid of the grappling hooks  i dont know i have no idea what im doing  matt okay  sam and then i see that the giant thing in

keep it restrained but  sam oh shit sorry sorry i dont know how this stuff works  matt but it does burn you see it gurgling grunts trying desperately to break free  as you see the smoke of its burning flesh rise up off its body sizzling /none/ sound  sam okay  matt end your turn taryon  sam i have a bonus action ill use sanctuary on myself  matt okay there you go and with that dotys gonna go ahead and reach down and try and  grab nope not with a four  as you see creaking noise you hear the metal kind of creaking  but not getting any sort of actual  marisha aw  taliesin knees not back  matt i

backward  liam bye  matt theyre being left behind by the boats  taliesin good  matt theyre trying to swim forward that brings us to marid okay  taliesin ive been waiting for this so for pretty much a few months  matt so this guy is currently up in the side and hes looking around hes gonna make a quick  perception check just to look around he got shot by you he got shot by you hes /none/ gonna go ahead  and glance up in your direction hes gonna go ahead and use a water jet ability against you  taliesin all right  matt actually lets see here  travis water jet  laura explosion sound  matt you

him  matt yeah for him  travis it really frustrates him  matt and for that hes gonna aim for trinket and vax  laura what is he /none/ doing what  matt aiming for trinket and vax  laura gasps  matt so all of a sudden it turns its head this way opens its mouth hoarse gasp and you watch  as this small spiral of  greenish energy begins to swirl and a singular burst of extremely  accelerated water just hard impact sound fires through the fog out of sight you hear this  whoosh sound and you turn just in time to watch as it blasts towards both you and trinket  i need you to make a dexterity saving throw and trinket as well /none/  liam vax or vex  matt vax  liam vax yeah youre fine  laura yeah im fine  liam oh youre doing trinket right  laura whoa trinket rolled so good  liam 17  matt 17  laura

thrust off at an arc  liam mmhm  matt and splash into the water splash into the ocean  laura gosh thank god trinket ducked  matt  soaking you down into the wave the elemental creature swirls up and occupies  both the space of grog and trinket and is going to go ahead and turn it into /none/ a whelm so its  going to uh attempt to whelm both of you and  i need you and trinket to make strength  saving throws  travis strength saving throws i have advantage because im raging 26  laura 18  matt all righty you guys both pushed out of its space so it forces you out however you both  manage to escape any sort of damage as its giant spiral this whirlwind of water spins around and  you both barely force your way out of it before it can do any serious damage to you /none/  laura bearly  matt all right that leads us to vaxs turn  liam okay so in the water click the boots and the wings shootout and i explode up  out of the water into the air  sam wow so cool  matt okay  liam and i just start gunning it towards the guy who knocked me in right  matt okay  liam and when im about i dont know 30 feet away from him im gonna because im hasted i  get 120 feet of movement just for regular

shank your booty shank your booty  matt okay got you so he loses concentration he is now poisoned and restrained he has to make  a saving throw actually to see which he did not so yeah still restrained  laura yes  matt whoof that sucks okay that ends vaxs turn vex youre up  laura awesome  liam get him  laura cool then since hes got my brother next to him im gonna fly /none/ down so i can see him  better and shoot him two times with my blazing bowstring on the first one  liam she shouts as she flies through the air  laura blazing bowstring activate  marisha electric guitar sounds  laura do i still get disadvantage  matt you do the fog is still present  laura okay 28  matt 28 hits second attack  laura second attack is just can i do regular  matt yes thats fine  laura 18  matt hits go ahead and roll damage for both  laura 12 with three /none/ points of lightning damage  travis did you add your hunters mark  laura im about to 13 additional and then ten with the blazing bowstring  nine more with the blazing bowstring  matt nice all right  laura and then my second attack  matt correct  laura 11 plus three lightning  matt all righty  laura i dont get sneak attack again but i do get hunters mark  matt you do get hunters mark yes  laura and three more for hunters mark  matt nice so after hes stabbed in the side and the /none/ poison pulses through his system  turns around and as the arrow slams into him burst of flame  and lightning arcs through his body  laura and im gonna fly back a little so he can see me less and then im going to have trinket  for my bonus action  marisha gasps  laura  run forward and attack the guy on the edge of the ship  liam is it a leap year  marisha this hasnt happened in like 20 games  laura i know i know  marisha oh my god  matt is /none/ trinket doing just a regular attack  laura yeah because its my bonus so he can just do one attack  matt because if you wanted to instead of going for a damaging attack you can go for a shove  laura oh i could i didnt think i was allowed to do that  matt yeah you can do it you can sacrifice an attack for a shove strike it doesnt do damage  laura i want him to do that thats what i wanted him to do  matt i was wondering if thats what you were going /none/ for  okay so go ahead and roll an athletics check for trinket  laura athletics is that strength thats just five  matt five okay yeah so trinket goes up and slams into the guy and he gets pushed against the  side of the ship but not with enough force to shove him over the edge  and he grunt catches himself  laura so trinket just stands up hes got his paws on his chest  matt just pressing growls on there yeah  laura growls loudly into his face  liam growls  matt all right /none/ that ends your turn percy youre up  laura i mean thats scary a big bear especially if these guys are on the sea  they dont see bears very often  taliesin all right that guys still in the vines right  matt correct yes  taliesin hes becoming a problem though okay im going to if i can pull this off  is it possible that i can break the rope that im currently holding onto and do a little errol flynn  like fly down to the bottom of the boat  matt you can do that /none/ yeah  taliesin is it possible that the rope i have to shoot is in between me and him  matt uh sure  marisha you going to kill two birds with one stone  taliesin im going to use a piercing shot and im going to try to do both with one shot and  errol flynn this shit  travis oh shit oh shit  matt okay make an acrobatics check as part of this  marisha errol flynn this shit is that what you said  matt this is specifically the kind of shit acrobatics is for /none/  travis totally 100 swashbuckling  taliesin acrobatics thats a 23  matt yeah go ahead and take it still at disadvantage  taliesin still at disadvantage  matt because of the fog  marisha oh man now youre in an angelina jolie movie  taliesin nope  matt nope  taliesin so this is gonna be funny because i was using the animus  matt yes  taliesin so depending on how mean you wanna be here im gonna take my 2d6  matt oh you misfire  taliesin yeah  matt laughs  taliesin so this is gonna /none/ be funny im gonna take my 2d6 and thats six points of psychic  damage to me thats cool thats cool  marisha what if one day you died because of that  matt okay so you use your piercing shot to shoot both at him and to shoot the or to shoot the  rope and then swing down  taliesin yes so does the psychic damage mean i let go of the rope im holding on to or does it  not also my feet are sticky and my hand has  matt your feet are sticky but /none/ your hands are not  taliesin but my hands are not  matt its the blast of psychic energy you know what  ill say go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin okay im down for this  matt yes make a wisdom saving throw to see if you can withstand the blast to your brain as your  vision goes white  taliesin so thats an eight  liam goes in the drink  matt nope  taliesin heres the next question do i have any chance of grabbing anything  with my hands and feet /none/ on the way down  matt unfortunately no what happens is as you grab the rope and you fire as you slash  the rope and go to swing down you go to fire and as you do it backs up and your vision just  goes white and you feel your whole body go instantaneously numb youre not sure if youre  even holding the rope anymore all of your  taliesin so im just gonna wake up on the deck of the floor of the boat  matt  and the pain sears in your brain you hear /none/ the heartbeat the pulse of pain  through and as your vision comes to it clarifies and color comes back just in time for  you to see the surface of the ship rocketing towards your face impact sound and you slam  into the ground straight across landing prone at the base of the ground  in front of the fish creature  laura oh no  travis it was so cool  laura that one was seriously bad  sam can i yell out no new best friend  matt you can you take 12 points of bludgeoning /none/ damage from the fall  taliesin 12 points of bludgeoning damage and can i burn a bonus action am i okay or  matt you could use i mean that was your action you land yeah youre still prone  but you can still use the rest of your attacks if you want  marisha im sorry your best friend  taliesin i can use the rest of my actions  matt i mean that was an attack the piercing shot so you still have your two other attacks  if you wanted to use them  taliesin just because /none/ it hurts and im irritated im just gonna pull out retort  and fire in the general direction  matt okay so two more strikes both at disadvantage  taliesin yeah  sam gunshot sounds  taliesin oh thats not bad  marisha what the fuck  taliesin 28  matt 28 hits  marisha thats not as good  taliesin 16  matt 16 does not hit  taliesin okay so the 28 one does though thats seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage got it okay so as you roll over on your back and /none/ pull out  retort and just fire two shots one just goes off into the fog you see it tear through the ship  mast for a second some wood splinters the other one you hear the creature take the impact from  the blow youre not even really paying attention where its going youre just hearing the sound  and shooting in that direction all right thatll end your turn percy  taliesin oh yeah  matt laughs  taliesin what a turn what a terrible way to go  matt grog youre up  travis i wanna keep /none/ hitting the water elemental  matt all right so you turn towards it over there go for it  travis reckless attacks please  matt yes  travis first ones a 30  matt thatll hit  travis 21 points of damage  matt all righty  travis second attack its very methodical 26  matt all righty  travis does that hit  matt yes  travis and 17 points of damage  matt 17 points of damage all right so you rush in and slam twice in this elemental again  you see its form with each hit /none/ is just splattering water against the ground and where  once it came up as this solid force of water its starting to have difficulty keeping its form  together where once it was focused genuinely on you and trinket it seems to be lashing out now in  a frenzied state its just punching all around does that finish your turn  travis am i not good enough to hold your attention yeah that finishes my turn  matt okay got you all right this guy heres gonna squeeze past the side  laura trinket attacks him on the /none/ way over  matt he hasnt moved away from trinket yet  laura damn it  matt actually no hes gonna squeeze this way instead because grogs on that side hes gonna go  ahead and move past the bear and let trinket push his weight into the side of the ship and is going  to go ahead and take three strikes at you grog  travis yay  matt with advantage  travis another playfriend  matt thats gonna be two strikes against you and one against trinket  first one with advantage is gonna be a 24 /none/  travis hits  matt dagger is gonna be a 15  travis misses with advantage too  matt yeah his first attack roll was a one all right so you take ten points of piercing  damage reduced to five  travis okay  matt and then the other rapier attacks gonna go against trinket which is a natural one jesus  travis wow  matt so he just swings and trinket catches the blade in his teeth and he draws the rapier back  which is now covered in bear slobber  travis this is not the time /none/ to choke buddy  matt that ends his turn this guy here is gonna go ahead and turn to face off with captain adella  hes gonna make three strikes against her  marisha cmon adele dazeem  matt thats gonna hit first rapier strike second rapier strike and the dagger  all three hit unfortunately  laura were all such dicks  travis you guys are awful  marisha weve got these shitty nicknames for everyone  matt 14 and okay total of 21 points of damage on her  travis 21 points  matt so as she tries /none/ to parry to the side the pirate just catches her offguard and gets  three good hits in but adella parries off to the side gets pushed back a bit and then forces her  way forward preparing her counterattack  travis come on  matt that brings us to  travis we should probably protect the captain  matt  keyleth  sam okay  marisha oh shit were still attached to this boat right  sam multiple times  matt currently yes if youre still concentrating on this  the waters still pouring into it  marisha i /none/ am how much slack do we have before i start pulling our boat underwater because i dont  want to be that kinda thought someone would start  matt it depends right now itll be probably two rounds before it begins to genuinely start sinking  heavily depending on if the ballista get another shot at the side or not  marisha i wanna keep doing this can i concentrate my flooding of water so theres now  a hole in the side of the ship under where tary was right i had to think not to say scanlan  /none/ matt correct  marisha i wanna flood in more water can i flood it more on this side to where i try and or can  i do something fancy like a giant hand of the gods from the wave come up and  taliesin kind of like fantasia  marisha  take the fishhead guy  travis what the shit  marisha or can i at least try and flood that side to where i can try and toss him over  matt you can either choose to continue to flood the ship or use control water to attack /none/ the fish  character one or the other  travis dont look at us man  marisha let me see if i can control water and take a wave to toss him overboard  matt toss him overboard  laura hes a fish thatll help him  marisha he is a fish  matt he is very plainly a fishbased creature  marisha he is very definitely a fish  matt the lower half of his body is a swirl of water  marisha oh right  travis so put him in the water  laura i dont think putting /none/ him in the waters gonna help us very much  travis water and water makes  marisha you know ill just keep sinking this ship  matt okay  marisha im gonna keep concentrating  laura you could get rid of the fog  matt okay  marisha i cant do that right now  matt the torrent of water continues to shove down into the ship youve redirected it as its  pouring into the side you use your other hand to pick up another portion of water and start  spraying it into the wound that was left /none/ right above taryon youre getting sprayed by water  overhead as its just traveling over you like an epcot center water fountain  marisha youre good right tary  sam yes  marisha all right  sam this is so weird  marisha good this is like a tuesday for us  matt all right so the crew on this side this guys gonna go ahead and move up higher up  there and take a swing misses unfortunately this guys gonna take another crossbow shot down  at the one thats attacking the captain that will hit actually  /none/ travis yes get him  laura get him  matt all righty and then these two guys are gonna take two more ballista shots as they load  up pull it back this guy continues actually this guy doesnt get a shot because he spent  the last round winching and pulling it back so he gets one shot retracting this guy managed  to pull it back and take a secondary shot at the ship that hits its not a critical but its  still pretty decent that is 14 points of damage on the side of the ship /none/ this one slams into it  maybe about five feet to the left keyleth actually all of you who are on the ship  you feel the impact as the second blow hits and it pulls out the side this time much lower  and water is now really pushing the ship is slowly starting to capsize to one side  that ends that groups turn  sam ive read about this many of us will die  all laugh  matt tary its your turn  sam my turn  matt yes  sam okay is there water all /none/ over the deck is it hard to move is it okay  matt i mean its wet and the deck is currently listing to one side  sam okay  laura is it listing towards keyleth and  matt its listing this way  travis boat shoes  sam yeah those are like impervious to water  all laugh  sam okay once again ill yell back at doty and just say  ahh the thing with the grappling hooks again  matt doty actually does succeed this turn  all cheer  matt doty lifts it out and now /none/ that its starting to pull the chains are very taut  as this ship lists the ships being pulled a little ways towards it the chains are strained  so as soon as doty pulls it up it just goes firing off the side and plunges off the water to  the other side the ships now beginning to slowly turn this way as the other chain is now tugging it  from that direction and this is now listing to that side so what are you doing tary  sam yeah im going to cast haste as my action /none/ and i get a second action now  because im hasted right  matt you get to use a second action thats a melee attack  sam it has to be a melee attack  matt melee attack disengage hide  sam can i use it said i could use a magic item  matt yeah  sam or use an item use an item  matt yeah use an object  sam oh use an object not an item i cant use my ring or anything right  matt ill say for the purposes of this sure why not /none/  sam okay so im hasted i will use i pick up the ring of the ram and ill ram the fishman  travis oh yes  laura oh nice  matt okay how many charges does it have  travis ring of the ram thats been a while  sam three charges right so i can use two  matt you can use as many charges as you want that the ring holds  it should tell you up to a certain amount  sam it has three charges  matt okay  sam well it says i can /none/ use an action to expend one to three of its charges  okay ill do all three right  all laugh  matt all right so it is still restrained so go ahead and roll with advantage  an attack roll plus seven  sam ooh 19  matt with advantage  sam oh natural 20  all cheer  matt oh shit well okay roll 6d10 force damage  travis holy shit 6d10  taliesin how many do you need  matt well then we double what he rolled because its a critical  marisha six you need six /none/  travis and thats force damage  sam okay 35 70  matt 70 points of force damage against the creature so as you focus on your ring theres a  burst of divine whitelooking energy that turns into this giant platelike shield in front of you  and it just stays there youre like huh and suddenly it thrusts forward and out the front of  it like a portal a giant spectral ramhead just slams into the chest throwing it off the ship  as it screams it just turns into sea foam  all cheer  travis /none/ you killed it  matt its scattered into the ocean across from you it is destroyed  sam can it be like a kid whos holding a rifle but not up to him so it hits him and it really  throws me back a little  matt which yeah sure roll a dexterity saving throw  sam five  matt off the ship into the water  sam yes  matt splash into the water  travis back in the drink again  marisha are there still bad guys left  laura yeah  matt there are theres two /none/ over here and theres two currently in the water below  ending your turn  marisha but nothing left on the ship right  laura that we see  marisha that we see  matt correct these guys are trying to swim forward that was cocked nope these guys  at the top of the round get pushed back  marisha bye  matt taryon  sam i lost alter self when i hasted  matt yeah so youre just generally swimming but you also float back in the ocean youre now  caught in the water behind so the /none/ ship carries on without you  taliesin and that was the last anyone saw of taryon darrington  all laugh  matt all right  marisha he got his 50000 worth  matt the water elementals going to go ahead and take two slam attacks  sam you there hello  matt its taking a slam attack against grog its taking a slam attack against the pirate  travis yeah  matt so against grog it has advantage on you because you used reckless  travis yep  matt that is a 23  travis hits  matt 16 points /none/ of bludgeoning damage reduced to eight  travis okay  matt and against the pirate that hits and the elemental reaches around and as it  punches grog in the face it slams the other pirate in the head its fist engulfing his head  and he just kind of stands there trying to find a way out and it just drowns him while its  standing and it drops the body to the ground  laura oh fuck  travis oh it killed him  matt yeah it lashed out  laura one of our guys  matt did /none/ enough damage no one of the pirates  laura oh shit he is untameable  matt vax youre up  liam you know when you look at a cat thats alarmed because its nervous and all the hair is  puffed out vaxs feathers are all going like pffft watching keyleth wreck the boat i could  fucking watch you do this all day up into the air and

across the way fire the bullet it blasts across  and you guys see this glow of electrical energy that just shoots through the air the bullet  enhanced by the cabals ruin vestige enchantment as it blasts into the side of the elemental  the elemental gets blown back through the air and as it does it just vaporizes  all cheer  marisha is that everyone done  matt all the enemies currently seem to be not on the ship or dragging behind  however creaking noise  taliesin im going to /none/ stop im going to wave and im going to go walk over and start looking  to see if i can see what that glow is im going to deactivate this  because i want to loot this ship  matt okay make a perception check  taliesin ooh thats better thats 25  matt 25 you glance in the side and you see now there is a singular small palantírtype orb  but smaller that is a foggy gray color on the inside thats slowly swirling and you can see  its gathering condensation and mist around it  /none/ taliesin does there seem to be any mechanism for turning it off or otherwise  matt it looks like its just embedded into it  marisha take it with us take it with us  taliesin im going to at least try and pick it up and  matt make a strength check  taliesin okay  liam while hes busy im gonna jet over next to keyleth  matt okay  liam oh are we in combat rounds  matt were going to stay in order for a second  liam oh okay  matt

taliesin thats so mean  all laugh  liam its like when you just reach out to pick up something  marisha yeah you never know getting old man  taliesin theres no way to  matt as you go over to it you see its there but its currently held in place by something  thats beneath the orb or at least its either /none/ adhered or glued to or held there you just dont  have the strength to lift it  taliesin theres gotta be a way to turn this off  matt so thats your turn  marisha i shout to  matt its grogs turn actually  marisha sorry  travis i go over to the harpoon hook and like fuck this harpoon hook can i try and get it out  of the ship with my strength  matt sure go ahead and roll a strength check with advantage because you are raging  travis hey 25  matt onehanded /none/  laura hey  matt tink fwoomp and it just flies out of your grip from the tension out of the ship you have to  pull your hand back cause the one of the giant gnarled edges of it  almost take your arm off in the process  travis gasp  laura you almost lost that gauntlet  matt it tears a section of the edge of this boat off just the railing on the side kind of pulls  through it immediately  travis ill pay for that  matt trinket has to pull off to the /none/ side and the one guy kind of backs up immediately as it shoots  off into the water below for you guys the ship now that it doesnt have the tension to the side  is now capsizing very quickly and turning on the side  taliesin oh god  travis i feel like i did something bad  marisha that was cool  travis oopsie  matt keyleth youre up  marisha i say hey guys cruises are really trashy laughs  travis jokes while youre doing that  marisha and i still have control water going  liam /none/ tip your waiters  marisha can i flush out the bottom of the cruise ship and bring whatever treasure is up out of the  bow with what water is there just kind of whoof  taliesin like a spigot  matt youre kinda off to the side you can look down its not very welllit on the inside at all  like it is not lit on the interior you do have your elven darkvision for a few feet so you have  to glance over and look into the room below but right now all youre seeing is /none/ seafoam and  ocean pouring into the side of the ship  marisha okay i stop sinking the boat because were not dying  matt okay the ship is still sinking you filled it with water  and currently the side of it has been blasted twice  marisha i bring the water up like a fountain of wealth and youth  just coming up out of the bottom  all laugh  matt okay  liam wow  marisha just other way  liam oh boy  marisha seeing what comes out from the bottom of the ship  /none/ matt okay  marisha hopefully not dead bodies or like  taliesin sings its rainin men  laura i know if there were slaves  marisha slave trade or something sad yeah like slave  laura fingers crossed lets not do that to keyleth  marisha oh come on  travis its just kids  marisha hes looking at his notes like its a thing  travis its just kids  everyone laughs and groans  travis kids and puppies  marisha thats my worst nightmare  matt youre terrible  travis kids and puppies  liam gosh  matt /none/ okay so as the water comes rushing up from underneath you see a lot of genuinely soaked food  items come shooting up large chunks of broken wood  what appear to be additional iron ballista spears  marisha oh  matt and lots of chain come firing up from the inside  marisha watch your head points  matt furniture chairs occasionally water sound effects just pieces of broken things from the  interior youre not seeing much else than that at the moment  marisha aw these were lame pirates no treasure  taliesin lets get the orb /none/ at the very least  matt sarcastically good pirates keep all their treasure on their ship at all times  marisha lame  all laugh  liam just hundreds and hundreds of nes classics  laura we really shouldve kept one of them alive  travis do you wanna check the captains quarters before it all goes down  laura yeah what if theres a map to treasure  liam sighs looks like its going down pretty fast though yeah  travis those of you on the boat  taliesin doing it now yes we want to it now while /none/ theres  an order of operations based on a die roll  keyleth i have control i have control  matt taryon  sam yes  matt anything you wish to add to this circumstance youre now soaking wet but your  winged savior

gonna go and land next to keyleth  matt okay  taliesin see if we can grab the orb im gonna run downstairs and see if i can see paperwork in  the captains quarters /none/ or anything or run in the captains quarters and just do a massive loot  really just as quick as i can  matt investigation check with disadvantage the room is currently tilted pretty heavily  and everything has slid and collided onto one side of the room  its just a giant pile of broken furniture  marisha i said i balanced it out and that im kind of doing that  travis you want me to jump over there and go get the orb  laura yeah  marisha we also kinda put a bunch of holes into /none/ the side of it  matt yeah there are a bunch of holes in the ship  marisha so i can only do so much  matt your control water can localize some cool effects but overall the ship itself has taken too  much damage  travis can i use my boots of feral leaping to leap from one ship to the other  matt sure make an athletics check  laura i want to fly down and help percy investigate if theres time  liam were pretty flush already lets make it quick  taliesin well there might /none/ be something magic okay my investigation check

you can theres a small leather tube you grab that  looking about inside theres a ring of keys you find a bunch of scattered coins throughout  the room it looks like there was a couple of small chests that just opened up and  taliesin im looking more for magic i dont /none/ care about gold magic or weird  matt right  taliesin catch the eye are the keys like  matt they look like some sort of opening device yeah  taliesin oh no okay yeah im gonna grab them anyway  matt okay so you grab the keys cool all right  travis 22 to jump across  matt to jump across okay so you make it across and you try and go underneath now the ship now  not only is it listing to one side but its starting to lift up a little bit  marisha i try /none/ to balance it as much as i can  matt so youre slowing the process slowing it  marisha yeah  travis make my way to the orb rip it out  matt the ship is also slowly moving behind the other ship as its no longer maintaining speed  all right so what are you doing  travis im trying to make it to the orb that he was too weak to pull out  matt strength check  taliesin i hope you pull something in your knee  travis hah 25  taliesin god damn it  matt /none/ popping

marisha please tell me i didnt kill someone innocent again  matt yeah you could fly over because youre behind him as you rush in to help him he has a  couple armfuls of things the room is now about kneehigh with water and is tilting heavily to  this side and theres just floating bits of paper and soaked books and pieces of broken wood and  furniture the room is utter chaos  laura anything interesting  taliesin yeah /none/ i dont know hold on im gonna listen for it  marisha hopefully no innocent people  taliesin perception check  sam muffled help me im an orphan  taliesin youre terrible 17  matt 17 you take a listen through all the splashing of water the sound of wood creaking  and the ocean outside you dont hear anything  laura what are you listening for  taliesin i show the keys im worried theres a cage down there  i still have the spider boots so im holding on  matt okay  laura can i hear anything /none/ with my elven ears  matt make a perception check  taliesin youve got an elven perception check  liam theyre taking the hobbits to isengard  laura what do your elf eyes see oh nothing  liam it was a one  laura it was a one  matt okay yeah you go down and listen and as soon as you do the water splashes up into  your ear and you get a bunch of salt water in the ear canal  up in your nose a bit youre like ugh  laura that was awful we should /none/ get out  taliesin im gonna hand her a bunch of stuff including some of my things and be back im  gonna try and see if i can just  matt spiderboot down  taliesin spiderboot and see if i can hold my breath and look  laura dont drown percival  taliesin im gonna grab and try and use the lenses on my mask  to even get a clear shot of whats under there  matt okay  marisha and im just trying to visualize with the last ten minutes that i have of control water to /none/  clear the bottom of this passage  matt so you can do that you can prevent slowing the sinking to part water  marisha the rushingin thats what i want to do i wanna part right where percys heading  matt okay as you do that the ship begins to list even further back and at an angle and you  watch as the front of it comes upward and everything on the ship begins to slide past  travis yes  matt  in the direction of keyleth and vax  marisha sorry physics  liam get off /none/  matt can i have you both make dexterity saving throws if you could  marisha what me too  matt yes  marisha jesus f christ  matt a bunch of barrels just rolling sound in your direction  marisha oh thats not too bad just straight dex saving throw plus five  liam natural 20  marisha what did i roll 16  matt okay yeah you both manage to just sidestep out of the way  as they tumble past and splash into the water below  taliesin get out of here you two  matt youre /none/ starting to lose your footing a little bit you probably have one more round  before you just start sliding off the edge  liam lets go man  marisha quick quick quick  taliesin im fine vex is here you two leave  matt percival perception check as the water separates in the room  taliesin yeah thats what im hoping for  marisha aw you rolled a 19  taliesin thats 26  matt okay as you push down into the chamber with the walls of the water to the sides as you look  down and most /none/ of the furniture that was thrust up out of this area is cleared out you do see two  cages in the far back one of which is empty  the other one does seem to have some sort of humanoid inside  taliesin im going for it  marisha come on  matt okay you rush up to the cage and you look inside and you can already see what looks to be a  slumpedover humanoid you see no features and theres no light down here and your human  eyes dont make out a lot of detail /none/ the fact that you rolled so high its only the little bit of  light comes down here thats reflecting around  laura shit  taliesin ive already got the keys in my hand and im just going to start going for it  matt first key nothing second key nothing third key noth creaking sounds  sam cut the red wire  matt water begins to pour in from another side and the ship itself is pulling back i want you  to go ahead and make an intelligence check  marisha come on percy come on  taliesin /none/ im going to choose to use a resolve thats a save isnt it  matt thats for a saving throw  taliesin god damn it  travis why didnt you roll the snitch  matt what did you roll  taliesin i rolled a one  matt a natural one you start getting the keys in and theres probably a good 15 or 16 or so  keys on here and you get through about six of them before the ship itself has gone into a fall  and the cages begin to slide  taliesin okay im rolling theres /none/ someone in there but i cant get it and im going to  spiderclimb on the upside on the wrong side of the wood and stay out of the water and crawl out  liam was he under water or was the water  matt the water is being parted by keyleth currently  laura okay  matt the cage is beginning to slide now towards the back of the ship  taliesin i dont know what to do and im running out i dont know what else to do  matt okay so  marisha what  taliesin theres /none/ someone in a cage i dont know what to do  liam ill fly at that  matt okay  marisha are you going im gonna try whatever last bit of control water i have to try and part  and calm the waters where vax is going and i say go vax go  matt okay so you just fly in  liam if theres a cage ill go to it  matt as you rush down inside you watch as these two large heavy cages are tumbling in your  direction an empty one slams just past you /none/ and the other one slams into that itself turning  up a bit and something inside slumps to the side of the bars  marisha im trying to calm the water as much as i can  liam can i even see the lock or where the keys were  matt make an investigation check  liam all right  matt the keys you do not have percy has  taliesin i have the keys but none of them were working  liam thats a 21  matt 21 you manage to as you leap up using your wings in /none/ little bursts this is a small  enclosed space you cant use too much of the air to fly in what little bit of parting of the  waters being done you catch up and climb onto the top and you can see the cage has turned on  its side and the doorway is on the top so you can see the actual lock  liam all right while im hasted do i have an action left to get up there and pick it  matt id say yeah  liam yeah okay  laura and marisha go go /none/ go  liam 32  matt you reach out and pull out your picks and as you look up keyleth at this point  youre parting the water but the ship is now sinking and you are youre sliding off  taliesin i grab can i make a jump to grab  matt you can go ahead and make a dexterity check  marisha and im just holding concentration hoping someone catches me  taliesin my dexterity save or check  matt either  taliesin theyre both the same it doesnt matter  marisha thats good thats good  taliesin /none/ 22  matt just catch keyleth as shes about to slide off the edge and you hold her there now  i will not require a concentration check from you however  youre about to both go under water  taliesin yeah  matt youre holding her at the edge of the ship you get the door open it slams over on the side  and looking down inside you can see what appears to be  a slumpedover soggy mess of a person unconscious  liam okay can i keep going here or  matt yeah grab them pull /none/ them up firemans carry  liam and then just try to slowly messily float him up and out of here  laura i want to go help if i can  liam yeah  matt yeah theres not much room for flight its more like  liam all right so pull  matt  leaping through as you make your way there you just get up onto the edge as the water  goes past both percy and keyleth you guys  your faces just splash beneath the ocean water  marisha yeah  liam i shout out twinnie  /none/ laura i help i help i help  matt you rush down from the broom he goes and flings the person over your lap and you take up  on the rest of the ship as the boat now is completely submerged you watch the tip of it just  splash beneath the water  bubbling the water up around as  marisha i drop control water switch back to my alter self grab percy head back to the boat  matt okay  sam while this is going on im asking captain adellas crew for towels could i get /none/ a towel  or some sort of im really wet here  matt theyre all on the edge of the ship watching this happen with one in the crows  nest keeping an eye out and theyre not paying any attention to you  sam im just worried that this will rust if i dont get it dry soon so if i could get some  towels or maybe someone to fan it off that would be great thank you  matt all right no response but you are eager to repeat your question as you make your way over /none/  keyleth you pull percival because both of you guys sink quite a bit below with the ship  as soon as it goes under it goes under fast and as soon as you glance up to watch that vax  makes his way out and you can just see over the surface you relieve that to start swimming up  and both the two of you you release your boots and begin to make your way to the surface  it takes a moment and you just get to the cusp of what you can hold your breath before /none/ you both  break the surface percy takes a deep breath and you guys eventually swim your way over  towards the edge of the boat the fog by the way has begun to dissipate now and has been slowly  doing so since your removal of the orb from the edge  travis yeah  matt as you guys all manage to make your way back onto the surface of the ship waterlogged and  tired were going to take a break for the restroom  travis nice a fight at sea  marisha a fight at sea  /none/ travis we made it off the

water spell you focus and begin to just siphon the water out of the lungs  and immediately the body kind of convulses the throat opens up from the outside and you can  see the water just project outward as the chest pushes inward expelling the rest of the liquid  from the lungs immediately coughs  marisha vax help  liam yeah  laura pat pat pat /none/ pat pat  liam i do pat pat pat except i

matt what last murmurs of this mans life that remained as he began to fade to the drowning  you both manage to just bring him back from the cusp of death and coughing profusely over the  next 30 or so seconds turning onto his stomach /none/ and gathering himself taking breaths spitting  out whatever seawater still remains in his lungs he looks back up at you all and you can see he  has a ragged mousebrown hair on top and its shorter on the sides around the ear rather large  ears kind of square jaw but very scrawny and once again from the tattered clothes and  scars all over his body some fresh some old  looks like hes undergone a rough recent weeks  laura i feel like were finding percy all over  again  marisha no shit  matt /none/ kinda looks up at everyone  wh where am i  laura on a

thats /none/ fine thats fine  marisha have you sailed frequently before  what was your exact duty on this ship  laura first mate  marisha oh right he already said that so  you sail a lot  matt a fair bit yeah  marisha yeah  taliesin any tattoos on him  matt yeah actually a handful visibly  taliesin any id recognize i was on a boat for quite a while as well  matt right  taliesin it was a long time ago  matt make a history check  taliesin all right lets say 18  /none/ matt 18 okay none of the symbols you recognize necessarily however  the arrangement of them the placement of them and the general design are not used as theres  tattoos you could see theyre decoration therere tattoos you could see that are meant  as they mean something to the person these tattoos  and their placement seems intentionally to  intimidate  taliesin huh okay  laura was he a pirate  travis mr theton groove is anyone looking for you right now  matt i dont think so my crew went down with the ship  taliesin /none/ what was your captains name  matt he kind of looks over at you  wha what why  taliesin i was just curious how quickly youd answer it its fine carry on you will be  getting food dont worry this is not us being threatening were just its odd finding a man  in a cage in the bottom of a terrible ship filled with awful people  that alone makes us like you but you are  a bit weird  marisha thats true thats all true  taliesin it is true  marisha yeah  laura /none/ forgive us we have to be a bit wary  marisha weve seen a lot  matt no no thats  taliesin we dont mind if youre disreputable  we just would like  to know if youre our kind of disreputable  sam if i may new companions  travis oh god  sam when my father would have  taliesin oh boy okay  sam  sort of a cagey individual that he needed to interrogate he had an employee named the dog  who was a large man who would come and just squeeze them until they /none/ talked why dont  we just do that here it seems like it would be  much quicker than talking in circles like this  marisha do you have the dog with you  sam well we have this guy whos pretty big  marisha oh  sam  and i bet he could squeeze  travis i mean i second that method but im just seeing if anybody else  taliesin i feel like thats deeply premature  travis its deeply immature i would never  do something like that  taliesin immature indeed  sam well all right /none/  laura plus hes so frail right now im afraid grog would just break him in half  travis probably  matt he is noticeably looking nervously back and forth between taryon and grog and  travis i mean after all we saved your life  right  you wouldnt be yells hiding nothing would you  matt no  travis see  marisha honestly this is how we treat  people we like  taliesin god thats also true  marisha yeah  matt does anyone have any water  laura yes  taliesin oh yes  matt fresh /none/ water oh thank you  and he pulls it out and just starts drinking  thirstily from it  marisha all right so weve cleared a few things right you seem untrustworthy  and broken so therefore we like you what else can we learn about you  matt i dont know what youre talking about  look i have business contacts  i can get you paid just get me safe somewhere  taliesin what sort of business contacts  matt the sort that i do business with i told you we deal in trade across the ozmit  /none/ liam yeah i mean hes shifty as fuck but its no skin off my back right  taliesin no not really  travis we got any cages on this boat  taliesin oh were not we dont need that yet wheres he going to go  laura do i see any like clasp markings on him  at all  liam that question might be great but i think were all right  matt nothing clasp not really  travis gotta sleep at some point  matt you kinda glance over and look at the middle of his shoulders and /none/ his shirt is  kind of billowing and torn no symbol of the clasp  laura those scars on your body were they from before you were captured or after  matt some both ways the cages dont really protect very well  laura what were they doing to you  matt they were just having fun trying to get  information about my company and  you know being general pirate arseholes  travis sounds fun  marisha and youre sure they were just pirates yeah  matt well what else are they not the most  pious men /none/ ive ever met  marisha i dont know ive never met a real  pirate until just now  matt at which point one of the crewmen comes  up with a small cluster of biscuits  and hands them over as he greedily reaches out like oh  marisha wait one of the crewmen  taliesin one of ours  marisha one of ours  matt yes  laura yeah  liam yeah  laura i asked if they would bring him food  sam we asked for food  matt adella just sent him for food  laura /none/ i asked him to bring food  marisha why is he acting like hes starving  laura because hes been in a cage for two weeks  they didnt feed him very much  marisha oh him not our crewmate  travis holy shit  taliesin oh okay i  matt the crewman brought food and he reached out for it  marisha oh sorry  matt thats okay  marisha sorry we were confused sorry  matt thats okay  liam cant you see everything around you its all here  travis he brings up a plate of biscuits /none/ and  hungrily starts eating  taliesin bangarang bangarang  marisha i brought you biscuits eating sounds  taliesin congratulations peter  matt the crewmans a dick by the way just  marisha do you want these  matt these are good biscuits starving guy  to be fair that is kinda your style  laura thenton you will forgive us  if we dont give you free  rein of the ship while youre on here  matt oh no thats fine thats fine i mean  lock me up whatever you need  just get me back to /none/ land please  laura well promise not to poke you  matt thats appreciated  marisha so you said you travel the ozmit sea  frequently yeah  matt yeah  marisha have you stumbled upon the island of the  vesrah the ashari people of this ocean  laura laughs of the ashari  marisha of the ashari laughs  matt he says if what youre referring to is the islands of anamn we generally steer clear  too many reefs  marisha of omand alland  matt anamn anamn  marisha almond  sam aman  taliesin joy /none/  laura a  marisha almond joy  taliesin sorry  marisha the island  matt anamn anamn  marisha anamn  taliesin cluster  marisha anman anamn  travis well we should introduce ourselves  at least  laura yeah  travis we are vox machina a travelling group of acrobats and  laura defeaters of dragons no big deal  travis yep  liam i do van damme splits just as he  finishes that sentence  laura trinket gets up and starts dancing around like he knows what to do  when we say were performers  /none/ marisha and i light up my fire hands  travis we do have two smarter members that are not here scanlan and pike but maybe  youll see them later if you stick with us long  enough  laura shes a sailor too  travis yeah  matt great  sam percival am i misreading the scenario here can i please just pour acid on him until he talks  to us it seems like hes holding back am i misreading here  taliesin no well sort of not really sort  of its complicated we dont pour acid /none/ on  people well thats not true no thats a lie  we dont just pour acid on people  i feel like thats reasonable to say we dont just pour acid  liam context context is key  taliesin  theres usually context involved things are complicated  sam i am following your lead but  taliesin when it is time to pour the acid we will  undoubtedly make sure that you are on the front not yet  sam okay  taliesin  but youre good  sam all right  liam hey captain  matt adellas /none/ behind you guys  liam yeah  matt  just kinda watching this whole thing with her arms crossed  one of her crewmates is currently at the helm  liam i mean the closest place to us right now is our desination most likely right  were not gonna be able to dump this guy before we arrive do you think  matt yeah no we got maybe a day and a half travel til we reach the islands so  liam oy  laura thats all right he can stay on the boat  travis we got an /none/ extra room for him  matt we got a we can throw him in the brig  taliesin we can make the brig comfortable  laura yeah well give him food its all right  right captain  matt well set some of one of our men on guard all right pick him up throw him in the hole  two of the crewmen come behind and pick him up and kind of lean over the shoulder like  ooh thank you thank you very much all of you and he gets dragged off down below into the ship  /none/ liam byeee  marisha bye  laura captain have you heard of the tempest  fang  matt ive heard a thing or two  laura oh really  matt yeah  taliesin is it a pirating vessel  matt yeah  all laugh  matt i was gonna let him finish his whole diatribe before we had a conversation  but hes one of 18 working companies out of the archipelago so  travis i believe its archipelago  sam sea diarrhea  travis jot this down  horn noises  liam that was sudden  taliesin and the /none/ tension is relieved  marisha so wait if he works for one of 18 companies of the archipelago  that means the archipelago has pirates  laura  17 other companies  marisha 17 other pirate ships  matt pirate companies its a very some of them have alliances some of them have very very  deeprooted rivalries and yeah  taliesin the companies themselves have more than one ship if i recall  matt some of them do depending on the size  marisha wait did we just sink one of the other 17 companies of the archipelago  /none/ travis is there any extensive damage to our ship are we still pretty good  other than the railing getting ripped off  matt looking around my crewmen tell me were doing all right so well do some repairs when we  drop off at your location once you do your business well have some time to go ahead and do  a onceover of our ship  taliesin i may have some charts that i stole from the other ship as well  laura oh yeah i put them in the bag of colding for the time being pull /none/ it out  matt okay glancing about a lot of them are maps of portions of the archipelago the hespit  archipelago some are markings of various pirate headquarters various places of parlay a lot of  them are waterlogged and soaked and damaged but you can see elements that are a lot of them  are handdrawn notes in sections the leather tube that you found you pull it open and there is a  very very immaculate piece of vellum paper that appears  to have a number of glyphs scrawled across it  laura shit do we /none/ understand  sam may i see that  taliesin sure  sam i will identify it  matt okay  travis what  all cheer  sam much easier this way  laura thats great you can identify things how many times a day can you do that  sam i think all scroll of programmed illusion scroll allows an arcane caster to use an action  to cast the sixthlevel spell programmed illusion if the spell is higherlevel than the caster can  use they must make a spellcasting blahblahblahblahblah  laura are you an arcane user  sam /none/ i think i am  matt yeah  taliesin is this basically like the thing in superman 2 where lex luthors playing chess  travis in the prison cell  matt kind of  taliesin okay  matt you have to look up the spell for the specifics  but yeah its got some interesting uses  sam are you arcane  laura so basically its you you can use it  sam am i the only arcane  liam yeah  matt yeah  marisha yes im a natural caster youre the only arcane caster  laura i mean /none/ hold on to it in case we run into scanlan again  travis i am a powerful magician  laura or you can use it  travis and with that i take out the little gem thing that i pulled off the other ship  sam ooh should i identify that  taliesin you should identify it  marisha you should  sam can i more than once a day  matt look at the ability its the spell i gotta look  sam its the identify spell  matt yeah its a firstlevel spell  marisha all the papers /none/ all the papers in the world  taliesin i imagine youre sitting here going  matt its a firstlevel spell so as long as you have a firstlevel spell slot  sam oh  laura oh i have a spyglass i didnt even need to ask for captain adellas  sam its a ritual though is that  matt oh yeah if you can use it as a ritual then it wont use a spell slot when you do that  marisha you just do it it just takes time  sam all right i will ritually identify that whats /none/ that all about  matt that is a fog marker it can be used by holding it a round but it is generally used to  create a 100footwide fog cloud that lasts for an hour when used  sam do we know how to activate it  matt to activate it you have to spend a tenminute period of time concentrating on the  orb and then as it gets moved it carries the fog cloud with it and lasts for an hour  laura thats cool  sam could be useful  laura super useful  taliesin at /none/ the very least it could be installed in the ship they could have it as a possible  sam cloaking device  travis you could put it in the guts of dottie  sam doty  travis yep  laura deedee  marisha could you do that  taliesin i dont know its not like hes hollow  marisha in doodie  sam i mean hes got a lot of stuff in there  travis but thats not important that stuff in there  liam what kind of stuff  taliesin things  sam you know  liam no  /none/ sam when you have two wheels and some ropes and it makes a pulley system  travis okay no just give it back to me ill put it back in the bag of holding  sam all right  travis thanks  taliesin how big is the orb out of curiosity  matt the orb is maybe seveninch diameter its about that big  taliesin all right  marisha its seveninch  matt yeah its about that big  taliesin interesting all right  matt so the ship is still progressing in that direction  marisha can i do a /none/ nature check on it on the orb  matt to what do you want to do with the nature check  sam to see if it smells like nature  marisha did it come from any water ashari or anything like that  all laugh  travis what  matt roll a nature check  sam are you my brother are you my brother  all laugh  marisha 14  matt it looks like a magic item  marisha thats awesome thats cool  taliesin does it have smoke inside when  you turn it  matt yeah when /none/ you turn it  taliesin like those weird balls filled with weird sand  matt yeah actually it kinda looks like that as you shift it it swirls on the inside  it causes the air intense condensation that eventually drips  from the outside of it when its activated  laura cool  marisha laughs outlook cloudy  matt all right so as everything rests down in the ship you can use you have about a day and a  half travel until youre supposed to reach the islands  travis can i post up outside of the brig /none/ where stabbedinthebody mcgee is sleeping  matt yeah and as he  travis ill forego my room i just want to sleep sitting up  liam do we have rooms i thought it was like amex city on this  laura no we have rooms but theyre combined  matt yeah theyre clustered you have many people per room theyre like bunks so yeah  you post outside of the brig as evening comes the night passes is there anything you want to  do you just rest for the night  travis yeah just keep the other guard company /none/  matt okay  travis just to give him a little expert help  taliesin weve been tinkering on the ship so  matt what have you been tinkering  sam sciencebro stuff  taliesin sciencebro stuff do we have to tell you what it is  matt to tinker it so i can give you a dc yeah  taliesin so hes got this really cool  matt we tinkered something really cool did it work  sure it succeeds we built voltron  taliesin you were very cagey about knowing what it is while we were on break /none/  so i didnt know if this was a thing  sam so using one of the opals from my helm of whatever brilliance  he wanted to craft a housing for it  taliesin so ive built a couple housings for these opals so you pop the opal in and it will  allow it to create either a concentrated beam  sam spotlight  taliesin spotlight basically like a little flashlight a radiant beam like a torch  marisha floodlight  taliesin like a floodlight or while its on spotlight its got a little railroad thing  its /none/ got a little slot that will go in and give me a little bit of a red vibe so we can have a  lowlight red light and im also going to make a little clip so i can stick it on my gun  so i can have a little spotlight on my gun when were going through a  liam it also ensures you cannot get a prom date  taliesin hey im doing okay just saying percy doing okay  laura i dont know youve been tinkering a lot lately  matt okay so thats doable the /none/ opal doesnt perpetually glow  sam yeah it lasts for an hour is that something we can turn off and on and it lasts for an hour  like a battery or is it just an hour its off  taliesin and then we have to pop a new opal in  matt generally you have to pop a new opal in  sam okay no problem  taliesin but you crack the opal you put it in its like one hour of either flashlight  and then a little blinder to turn it on and off its basically like /none/ a little train lantern  marisha i was gonna say like an oldschool lighthouse  matt go ahead and roll a tinker check  taliesin doing this together  sam can i help him  matt yes you would be giving him advantage as you attempt to do that  so you just roll it twice percy  taliesin that was pretty good  sam did we get two 16s  taliesin i got a 19  sam oh i got a 16 but i get plus ten with my tinkerers tools  taliesin and mines proficiency bonus and dex /town/ bonus on top of that 19 so thats 30  matt between the two of you guys it is not an issue even with your limited materials  but your traveltinkering capabilities you manage to deftly create this seamless beautiful  you could sell it on the street  taliesin so they can we may even make a little headband so they can pop it on  sam sure sure  matt laughs you guys are so cute all right  marisha i spend my evening reconnecting with vax  matt okay  all laugh  sam the hallmark card /none/ way of saying fucking  taliesin well there goes our sponsor by hallmark  matt yeah thanks sorry hallmark  liam its a couple days weve been traveling for a while right  matt it was three days before this encounter you have a day and a half left  liam and has a day passed since that fight  laura no  liam no this is that night  laura this is that night yeah  matt this is the evening afterward  taliesin ill see if i get my charges back  marisha i dont want to

 matt youre literally blinded for a moment  taliesin laughs  matt your eyes just go crackle  taliesin we put it in the box contain it  sam well wait open it just a little bit  taliesin all right  sam and then im gonna take my helm of brilliance and just put one of the diamonds up to  the laser beam like light coming out so it makes like a dazzling /none/ light across the  laura wow  matt its a beautiful prism which youre able to see in about 40 seconds  all laugh  laura its a lot its just a lot of spots right  now but im sure  taliesin sorry  laura eventually oh pretty um get out you not

taliesin and i boot him out oh hi thank god  and  laura so percy  taliesin yes dear  laura ive been meaning to bring something up to you  taliesin yes  laura at the risk of bringing up scanlan again  taliesin oh  laura something id rather ignore  taliesin yes me too  laura when he left he said something that caught my ear which was that he heard  he heard pike and his daughter calling to him  taliesin yes  laura from the other side which is strange  /none/ really because when i was on the other side  i dont remember hearing anything what about you  taliesin okay im gonna sit down and open up a bottle  laura busting out the courage again  taliesin the courage i think is long gone  at this point  matt yeah  taliesin im going for the tear whiskey fuck it take a swing and i pass  laura mm  taliesin i was not in a good place i was what  i am choosing to describe as great motivation  to live a long life there /none/ was pain and sound and  ive tried hard not to think about creating words  to articulate it but it was the feeling of being it was not pain without end it felt like pain  that would have an end because eventually there would be nothing left of me  i felt consumed and yes i heard it was the only thing i heard  yes i know you well enough to know  trying not to embarrass you but  laura all right  taliesin  yes  laura im not embarrassed  taliesin well i wouldve /none/ honestly i wouldve never hoped otherwise  youre far too wonderful for an idiot  laura laughs  taliesin so sighs but im more hopeful  im not quite as fearful of whether im worrying  less about what may happen when i die again  and if im going to go back there  laura well thats good i would hope hes not waiting on the other side for you  taliesin i hope not either and  laura what about when you were killed by raishan  taliesin that was quick it was fine but it was  /none/ quick so im not sure if that means anything yet  ive overthought this quite a bit and i dont know if you care to hear too many of my fears in  this direction but i do think about it  laura you can always tell me your fears percy  taliesin where do the people i kill go i know  you dont have an answer  i dont have an answer either but  laura i dont i suppose it depends on them  doesnt it  taliesin does it or does it depend on me or /none/ does it now depend on this thing  laura you dont think they were doomed to suffer the same fate that you were  taliesin maybe i dont know maybe i keep feeding it every time  laura oh no  taliesin i dont quite know how to find out  other than i had a moment  where i thought about shooting someone  bringing them back and asking them  laura gasps  taliesin there was a moment i thought  about shooting someone  well if it comes to it its something ive had  in my /none/ back pocket as killing two birds with one stone  laura maybe we can just try that on someone who we already need to kill  taliesin thats my thought  laura right  taliesin and i worry about what  all of this is doing to us  but at the same time i have such faith in i have such faith in you and keyleth and  occasionally grog and occasionally your brother  laura laughs are you listening  taliesin laughs but im starting to wonder if this is what all those heroes i read  about /none/ when i was young if this is what they felt is just a lot of getting very comfortable with  not knowing and being nervous and wondering if youre really  just the villain of someone elses story  laura im sure thats how they feel  no ones ever sure theyre doing the right thing  taliesin but i did hear you sorry to i did hear you and sorry that i didnt say  laura no its all right takes the pressure off really knowing that you know  taliesin i treasure every minute and you remind me /none/ to not be so serious  laura yes so serious  taliesin im not saying that youre not serious but sighs  laura exasperated voice you can go play  with tary some more if you like  taliesin im done with tary for the evening  laura great then you can play with me  all laugh  taliesin and crossing the whiskey off the inventory  matt off the yeah  taliesin laughs  matt all right as the evening  travis amazing  matt  the evening comes to a close  the next days journey is /none/ met  with a coming cloudfront does not appear to be stormbearing clouds but the clear skies seem to  have come to an end  marisha im restless in all of my nights sleep as we get closer  matt mmhm as the next day comes to a close the sun setting you hear a call from the top of  the crows nest that shouts out land ho  laura we go running up  matt you guys all catch up and you can see  liam quietly you got this  marisha groans  matt  just /none/ as the last bit of sunlit glow  behind the clouds begins to fade into darkness  you see ahead the gentle shape of islands just breaking the horizon ahead  and one by one little lights click click click  coming on  marisha i rush to the bow of the ship  matt as you come up to the bow of the ship you can see at this point now  captain adella is starting to shout off  to the side  keep it all high and is currently moving around and you see there are three /none/ guys at the  front who all have lanterns out and theyre watching the water below and theyre shouting out  five to the right and theyre giving different degrees and shes navigating through what looks to  be a channel of reefs as you glance over the edge and you can see there are pathways here  but it looks like a lot of this water is very dangerous water and eventually you get to a point  where one of them shouts stop stop and they immediately throw down the sails and someone  throws the anchor off /none/ the side and the ship crunching comes and slams to a halt as the  anchor clicks and you can feel it grinding for a bit as it catches the edge of one of it looks  like a reef below but the ship eventually stops as you glance over there maybe 15 feet away from  hitting the edge of a reef grinding sound it stops and the water whistling slowly comes to  rest as the ship comes to a rest looking over the edge you can see the water maybe about 20 or so  feet down /none/ with what little bit of light the lanterns have put over you can see the very top  of various reef cliffs and hints of beach shelf beginning to rise up towards this cluster of  almost like still fairy lights in the distance unmoving captain adella comes up to the edge of  the ship and goes  well thats about as far as we can get with this ship my apologies  marisha no this is fantastic and i run to the edge of the ship and i shoot a  daylight into the spell and throw a /none/ create water and make a rainbow over top of us  matt wow  marisha tch boom ooh  matt so with that pffff the spray of vapor in the air of the night  sky the darkness ahead of you that was currently the clouds obscuring any sort of  starlight suddenly is showered with a spray of vibrant colors across the entire spectrum  as the vapor slowly cascades around each side of the ship as it does a few moments pass and you  watch more lights spark open in the distance puff puff puff puff puff /town/ whatever the source is  you begin to get a clearer view and there you can just barely begin to see the edges of what appear  to be a very very faint outline of a number of buildings all springing up from the water itself  travis quietly oh shit  matt the city is not on one of the islands  the city is in the center of them  theres a triangulation of these land masses and  the city itself resides between all three  sam quietly wow  matt some of the guys in the /none/ front of the ship  start taking small rowing boats and  taking them up and latching them in and setting  them off the side into the more shallow waters below  marisha i run past all of them and just jump  into the water  not gracefully like before and start swimming  matt make a perception check  all groan  laura oh no  marisha perception check  matt yes  laura were at a reef  liam dont faceplant on a reef  marisha fine ooh  taliesin there is now  liam im /none/ on a reef  marisha oh thats just a dexterity check  matt no perception  sam perception  marisha oh perception 28  matt you run to the edge and right as youre about to leap you look and realize  theres relatively shallow reef in the direction  youre about to leap  so you kinda turn and laughs go at an angle  instead and plop into the water below  marisha nervous sounds  matt a second almost a second after you the ship cracks hits the water below and they  start throwing down the /none/ rope ladder and you guys are allowed to then step into the rowboat  laura broom  taliesin carpet  matt you have the broom or carpet if you like  marisha i just start  taliesin im gonna get on the carpet and offer it to anybody who likes  marisha using my cantrips  travis well i need the boat cause im heavy  taliesin what about the boat  sam i want to be on the flying carpet cause thats amazing  laura trinket will get in a boat with grog  liam what are you doing /none/  laura no trinkets gonna be in my necklace  matt all right trinket goes in the necklace  laura yeah for a minute  liam hopping on behind my sister  matt okay so your sister

rowboat for us  matt they have other rowboats on the side you can request another one  sam i would like to request /none/ another rowboat for doty  marisha laughing a boat for doty  matt okay so as you guys begin making your way  roughly five minutes behind you  as you all are  kinda moving forward together via carpet flight and her swimming and grog strongly pushing his  way through tarys just impatiently waiting for them to get the other boat off the side of the  ship and theyre slowly lowering it down kind of the ropes  having to adjust as it goes and youre  like groans  all laugh  travis i see adventure /none/ over this way  too bad you wont be there to see it  sam im missing it hurry up  all laugh  matt as you guys begin to approach keyleth your feet eventually hit sand as opposed to treading  water and as you begin to walk up the water comes past your waist  down to eventually your knees and that is about as low as it goes  marisha as far as it goes yeah  matt and looking out above you  you can see this beautiful lagoon that is completely submerged in about a /town/ foot foot and a  half of water for a good mile in all directions and you can see dozens and dozens of these  grecian looking white and green marble structures that rise up out of the water you can see a  series of poles that stand up holding these lanterns that have all been magically set alight  to give the city a sort of a glow you see shapes moving you see figures shifting out of these  buildings and making their way in your direction and as youre looking at this space in front of /none/  you and you guys begin to kind of meet up you watch as a figure whoosh out of the water  next to keyleth you glance to your left and look down and you see what appears to be a child  maybe about 13 years old humanlike though his ears come to a bit of a finned appearance  you can see what looks to be gill slits to the side of the neck and he looks up at you with kind  of a tattered longstiffened piece of cloth tunic and shorts that end at the kneeand /none/ he kinda looks  up at you and just kinda smiles with these very very bright orangeish yellow eyes  hi  marisha kaitiaki and i drop to my knees and drop down and  matt sploosh you go facedown into the water  marisha gah heavy breathing  matt get up and groans push the water the hair back a bit  marisha and bow again  laura laughs  matt okay um what are you doing  marisha sorry are you the leader are you the headmaster  matt yes yes i am  marisha oh hi uh /none/ keyleth  matt keyleth  and he reaches out and  grabs your hand yulan  marisha yulan  matt leader of the water ashari  sam laughs  marisha i am keyleth daughter of vilya and korren of the air ashari  and i am here to complete my aramente and i bow again under the water  matt splash into the water again  marisha gasps  matt he shakes his head you can see now he has these tossed mediumlength dreadlocks that  shake with his head as he turns side to side laughs he looks up /none/ at the rest of you  so she yours  laura mm mmhm  taliesin more or less  matt you bad people  laura uhuh  taliesin nah  travis not today  sam were just rowing up whatd i miss start over start over pants  matt is he a bad person  laura nah  liam nah hes all right  taliesin hes workable  matt okay well come with me and he reaches out and taps you on the shoulder keyleth  marisha gasp its just such an honor  matt come on  laura keyleth /none/  marisha what  matt he grabs your hand and pulls you up out of the water and starts running in towards the city  holding you behind him just kinda tugging you by the hand  laura oh he has legs  matt he does have legs  laura man  taliesin and he does know how to use them  travis keyleth  sam laughs  matt splash splash splash splash splash splash  travis be cooler  marisha cooler cooler blows and i let a little frost go from my breath  matt blows okay splash splash /town/ splash splash splash splash splash hes just running through  the water you can see a number of people have now stepped out of the buildings as you guys approach  and each one of them all of their clothing ends at the knee you can see that this entire society  walks through and lives partially submerged  there is an everpresent water element to their day to day life  laura they must have the pruniest feet  marisha  feet  matt laughs  marisha i know right  liam and matt laughs  travis that was /town/ amazing  i would live there in a second  taliesin how did that happen just now how did you just go there  laura laughs  matt the sand is soft and still strangely warm beneath your feet though the night has come  and even through the distant sparkles of light everywhere this city  a lot of the buildings seem hollow and open like what walls that there are theres large  windows it seems like everything has this very kind of openair free lifestyle to it  and as you begin to approach  marisha as /none/ hes dragging me i just start like rambling all the questions at once im like  arent this is such a gorgeous city you have are you freshwater or saltwater do you have  webbed feet does everyone have webbed feet how many people can control water wow look at that  look at those is this fire that you use or is it all arcane  matt hes not answering any of your questions and you hear a voice shout out yulan  marisha gasps  matt and the boy kinda stops and drops your hand and backs away /town/ with his hands kinda crossed behind  his back and he steps away bowing his head a little bit and splashing noise away the crowd  and you can now see all these different people most of them appear to be human elven  there are a handful of dwarves a couple halflings its a spread of races here you see  two halforcs that have these large tridents off to the side and theyre guarded but theyre all  deciding whether or not this is a welcoming circumstance or a careful parlay the voice that  rang out the /town/ crowd parts a little bit and you watch as the water around you guys begins to  spiral into these columns each one appears to be similar to the entity you saw rise onto the ship  a series of water elementals begin to rise out of the water as some of the individuals in the crowd  pull their hands together and then you see four of them rise and begin to circle not closing in  but just keeping very close vigil around and you realize at this point that while the  city is welcoming they are /town/ also a carefully guarded people the crowd parts and you see  stepping out with the tiniest of splashes a very tiny woman old shriveled most of her  hair is gone and these thin wisps of white and gray a wide ovallike head the skin itself an  olive yellow tint very wrinkled and pruny the eyes are almost these tiny little black  beads gnome very old with a long staff thats twice her height that just kinda with each step  squishing splash kinda like a weird female water ashari yoda  and just kinda steps forward /none/ through the water  marisha rad  matt yulan you are not to greet our guests now you what is your name  marisha hi clears throat kaitiaki i am keyleth daughter of vilya and korren of the air  ashari and i am here to complete my aramente i am  matt kaitiaki  marisha kaitiaki i am honored to be in your presence  matt i am uvenda heart of the tides here i had my own aramente long ago and i knew your  mother who came for her aramente as well  marisha you knew my /none/ mother  matt she came here for her own aramente  and now you come to complete what she could not so  marisha im im  matt  you are welcome keyleth of the zephra  marisha im sorry im sorry that just means she visited the earth and the fire and the water  ashari she completed her aramente  matt she did not child  marisha what hap she i everywhere ive been shes been why not  matt come come we shall speak there is much to discuss and it is growing cold out here  /none/ and you could probably all use a warm fire so see to our guests and the folks around go  from their tense reverie and begin to approach and take like just instinctually taking your  belongings and helping you unload you guys laughs withdraw and they back off as soon as  they realize that wasnt part of the circumstance but you are led deeper into this city and there  is a central temple that has multilayers three floors with a number of spiral staircases  on the outside of the structure that lead to it each floor /town/ is still very open and you get the  sense that this whole city is built around the flow of ocean air and sea spray and there is  almost like a constant breeze that just blows through and a lot of the buildings are rounded at  the edges the heavy waves and water that just come through here has you can see rounded and  brought curvature to all the structures for as long as the citys been around there are elements  of shelltype shapes there are bits of ocean inspiration to the architecture its a very /none/  interesting alien and beautiful place compared to where youve been before youre led into this  temple structure in the center of this city youre brought to a series of what look almost  like tree stumps but theyre made of a bright bleached white almost spongy material  and as you sit on them food is brought to you fish fresh cooked platters you guys are now  being treated like honored guests as you arrive as you sit down keyleth uvenda has a servant  bring a much taller sponged stool than the ones you guys have /none/ and its set in front of you  and she uses her staff and grunts polevaults on top of it and sits crosses her legs  and sets the staff off to somebody and kinda leans down with her hands in front her chin  resting on them her little beady gnomish eyes looking down at you  so keyleth the aramente is not easy  marisha i know  matt do you know what this leg of your journey entails  marisha i mean ive made it this far in my heart i feel like im almost complete but /none/ i feel  like youre about to tell me something different  matt you are near the completion of the aramente this is true and through this  you will learn the strength of utilizing your own capabilities and those of your trusted allies  you will learn various ways of looking at the difficulties and challenges that are before you  and there are lessons as part of this so listen carefully for the final leg of your aramente  we will wait til the morning sun comes to these waters  you and your compatriots will be brought /none/ down below the waves below this city to the aerie of  torrent where the vesrah rift resides to the water elemental plane the aerie is where we  implant the lodestones that keep the village from sinking and the rift size contained the  lodestones unfortunately do wane in power over time so we must occasionally cross into the rift  and have our fastest waverunners recover replacements within the elemental plane  the source of the lodestones in which we have built and maintained this city but  the oncechallenging path to these lodestones has now become deadly /none/ for all but our swiftest  marisha why  matt we would find these stones sparsely scattered throughout the plane just beyond the  rift leaving us uncertain of their origin for as long as weve been here for generations  they would just fall and sink to the bottom or wed scavenge them from the silt and sand  below however this last generation of  waverunners have discovered them to be a product  natural waste of a particular creature that resides within the boundless oceans of the plane  an ancient beast once guided upon creation by /none/ the titans that claimed this world their own  before the gods came and gave light to our souls  marisha whats it called  matt they are known in many languages by many names  but the common tongue knows to them as  the krakens  laura yells  marisha yells  sam scared panting  travis excited hyperventilation  matt humongous tentacled beasts long free of their servitude from their creators one of these  such krakens has taken to the waters near the rift and made it its home on the other side  and this /none/ beast appears to have been producing the lodestones that we relied on for ages this  research and information theyve gathered however garnished the attention of this terrible  fiend and was accidentally led directly to the rift where it now nests and feeds on the other  creatures naturally drawn to the energy of the tear between the worlds we now use the lodestones  and our powers not only to control the merging of the planes at the rift but to also prevent this  monstrosity from crossing over into our world and tearing our city asunder your /none/ task  marisha so  matt she puts a finger out to stop you would be to descend into this aerie of  torrent enter the rift and recover three of these lodestones and return to us that is all  avoid the beast if possible for to battle it is folly and to kill it is to sink our city  and curse the rift to eventually fade  marisha so dont kill it  laura do not kill got it  marisha dont kill the kraken right dont kill the kraken  travis no kill the kraken  /none/ laura laughs  liam get kraken  sam we can reason with it  marisha get three lodestones bring it back dont kill him because he is responsible for you  guys not sinking into the ocean  laura because he makes the lodestones  sam with his poop  liam poopstones  marisha he makes the lodestones  laura basically  sam poops lodestones  marisha  with his droppings  matt essentially yes  all laugh  marisha all right  matt to use such base terms  marisha all right so he drops these lodestones at the /none/ base of the water plane  matt yes often found within the vicinity of the rift but such is the beast be quick be careful  be stealthy and return as soon as you have them  marisha do you have an example of these lodestones  so that we know what were looking for  matt we will show you at the aerie tomorrow in the morning  marisha all right so this starts in the morn which is exactly what you said  you totally said that didnt you  matt yes yes i have  marisha all /none/ right  laura is there something that helps those of us who dont breathe underwater breathe underwater  marisha i can handle that  laura yes  marisha i can handle that so what happened to my mother  matt she swallows strongly your mother was a brave woman very much like you now that i see  you before me unsure of herself and wishing to please and not disappoint and its hard to  ascertain but i fear its perhaps that lack of confidence that may have caused her failure  marisha did she not make it out /none/ of the water plane  matt she brought her own companions that she had found and brought with her along her path  our guides brought her to the rift and her companions did not survive your mother did not  return and we sent scouts to try and retrieve her body so she could be interred correctly  but we only found a leg  marisha shes still alive that means shes still alive  matt hold onto that hope use it and finish what she started she lives through you at the  very least hold that memory /none/  marisha i will hold on to it but i hope you know that does not define me im not her  matt good then perhaps you have a chance  marisha well complete your task thank you  matt youve come far young keyleth i have faith that you will rise and become the voice of  the tempest for now we rest eat sleep for tomorrow you face the pet of the titans  and thats where well leave tonights session  travis yeah  sam scared panting  travis were gonna
