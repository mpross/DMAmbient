none	 fix that while were gone  matt marius makes a note with that you guys have made your way back to nicodranas the  bustling streets are there its early afternoon well say about 130 200 in the afternoon  there are a bunch of people currently dealing with shipments being taken out of ships put back into  ships as when you were coming in theres a number of naval vessels in the outskirts of the  harbor as well its a busy time of the day but no one seems to be paying you too much mind the 
none	  zhelezo are present havent gotten thicker immediate arrival but youre still nervously  keeping an eye out though you have no real conspicuous presentation other than beau  so what would you like to do where are you off to  taliesin ive had a thing ive been wanting to do for a while and i figure now is  possibly the time to take care of this i want to find a blacksmith  sam you seem unreasonably excited about that  taliesin well its not often that i have a pet project i havent had one in 
none	 a while and that  was the way i used to keep myself excited and busy back when i was home so ive got a pet project  its been a while  sam do you need any help what are you going to make something  taliesin i pull out the broken sword hilt that i have  sam oh yeah that  taliesin id love to see about getting this fixed maybe as a token of appreciation for  mr fjord for doing such a good job taking care of himself on his own quest and  not 
none	 getting sidelined into some bad thoughts  travis that is very thoughtful of you thank you  taliesin i also dont know how to find a blacksmith  laura oh i think i know a pretty good one  matt okay  travis access the memory banks warbling  matt you can make a history check as you however have not spent a lot of time traveling  around nicodranas as much as you grew up here you stayed indoors most of the time  laura i know of a really good one  i rolled a four  matt 
none	 you know of a really good one in zadash  laura oh shit i think its in zadash thats where i got that box made right  sam yeah that metal box yeah  laura yeah yeah yeah never mind  taliesin metal box  laura do you want it  taliesin i dont know ive never had a metal box before  sam we could probably ask around for a blacksmith  taliesin what do you do with it  laura wait i left it at the blacksmith  taliesin oh were getting so afar you just mimed a 
none	 metal box  laura i did yeah  taliesin thats amazing youre very talented  sam lets go ask around for a blacksmith  travis i think caleb had something to say  liam jester  laura yeah  liam what about a place that has writing materials paper and ink and that sort of thing  laura oh yeah my mom was big on books  taliesin theres a joke in there  matt make a history check  laura it was a little bit better 11  matt you have not been to a bookstore necessarily most of 
none	 the books that you had were  brought to you by your mom but you could probably wander around and find one eventually  laura yeah ill lead the way  matt okay are you guys beelining it to a bookshop then  sam why dont we split off and some of us can look for a blacksmith and some can look for a  bookshop and then well reconnoiter somewhere  taliesin if the people looking for a bookstore find a blacksmith they can send a little message  and if the people looking for a blacksmith find a 
none	 bookshop i assume we should buy everything we see  travis sure ill go to blacksmith with caduce  laura i was going to lead caleb to the bookstore  marisha ill go to the blacksmith with the guys  liam are you going to come along  sam i would love to come along yes  matt whos going to the blacksmith team blacksmith you begin to wander through the  streets asking questions around eventually some of the local zhelezo lead you over to the place  called ingots and hammers it seems to be a humble size 
town	 but this isnt a very big smithing town  necessarily in fact one of them you speak to goes like port zoon would be more the place to  go if youre looking for good brawny blacksmiths but there is ingots and hammers maybe they head  you over in that direction the exterior of it most of it the heavy stone base of the building  its a standard rectangle most of it open on the side facing the street so you can see the smoke  from the forge itself pouring out it doesnt have a specific chimney 
none	 built more than it billows out  in two places to create these two drifting streams that head up as you walk up you can see there  isnt immediately work being done it looks like perhaps there is a midafternoon break and you do  see a tan skinned heavyset burly looking fellow human smooth bald head a split lip that healed  back and it has this big scar piece that gives him a little bit of character and he sits there in  the middle of eating a bowl of fruit and glances up at you hello 
none	 can i help you  taliesin yes i was looking to have a sword repaired a very unusual sword  matt let me see it he sets down his bowl and walks over oh just a second hold on sets it  down and rummages through a small shelf unit in the back and pulls out a few books and pulls out  one tome opens it up and sets it down and begins thumbing through page to page takes about five  six minutes to find something before he stops and goes my apologies this is not really a 
none	 form of  forging that i can repair this is uthudurnian  taliesin uthudurnian  matt its a very far north very isolated people dual society dwarves and elves together  laura whoa  matt merger of the two styles of forging make for very unique weaponry but a little bit  out of my skill range my apologies  taliesin no thats good to know would you know of anyone who could point us in the right  direction or would we have to probably venture that direction  matt its north of the empire  taliesin north of 
none	 the empire  matt up in them wildlands  taliesin well now  travis north of the dunrock mountains would you say  matt yes thats the place  travis thats fucking way up there we are here and we got to go there  taliesin thats barely twoandahalf three feet i mean whats the scale on that  its like onehalf scale double  travis hundred miles  taliesin wow  travis so one two in a straight line three four five six seven eight hundred miles if we fly  taliesin we may be sitting on this for 
none	 a little while thats good to know thank you friend  matt happy to help wish i could be of assistance i could use the coin but good luck  taliesin thank you heres a couple coin for your trouble anyway i throw three gold at him  matt three gold he goes thank you very much you are very generous thank you thank you all  marisha whats your name by the way  matt dreef  marisha dreef  matt dreef whats your name  marisha beau  matt beau  marisha yeah like a staff  matt

town	 like weve walked down this road before at least twice  laura really  sam yeah  liam that is exactly what weve done youve been to this place before but when you were a child  maybe youve forgotten the way  laura oh i never went here no  liam did you get out did your mother take you around or did you have maybe a babysitter  laura no  sam neither  laura no  sam you were just let up to your own devices as a small child  laura no no no my mom

none	 they have inside here  matt you step inside its a smaller building and theres no other customers its actually pretty  quiet in there the only sound you hear is a silent purring from the owners cat its curled  up on one of the shelves and its purring as soon as you enter and make your first creaking  step against the floorboard one eye pokes open yawns stretches out stands up and looks at  you all and then turns around and just walks away  laura what color was the cat  matt oh the cat 
dung	 was a calico all splotches of brown dark brown black halfandhalf nose  theres three shelves on the left side the right side is just a window its open and what little  bit of light is in there is the daylight being let in its filling the space of this warm interior  there is a desk towards the back where you see a scrawny scrappylooking man in his late 30s or  early 40s his hair is combed back slicked but little pieces of it are falling in front of his  eyes he has a little bit 
none	 of scruff on his upper lip not enough to actually be considered a  mustache he glances up from a book that hes in the middle of reading and goes hello look  around anything you want im rusan anything that you may require let me know pay at the front  liam before i step forward i lean down to the ground snap my fingers and bring frumpkin the  cat into existence telepathically say go say hello to that cat and he scuttles off  matt meows  liam russo you said  matt rusan  liam rusan 
none	 oh my apologies i am looking to buy a bit of paper quite a bit but whatever you  might have also do you specialize in a kind of book here or is it a wide array whats your  specialty whats your favorite that you have for sale  matt this is a lot of questions hold on he sits there and has to file through in his head for  a second there is paper of course we have very nice parchment for presentation for events  parties invitations if thats what youre looking for as far as 
none	 books we have all sorts  of it the front shelf here is mainly discussions on various cultural philosophies there is also  a number of cooking manuals if youre interested in that there are an entire part of fiction that  deals with fictional accounts of the various gods of the various marquis the empires rise  that seems to be very popular among the visiting crownsguard i mean theres a lot of things  are you looking for something in particular  liam history of the area of nicodranas itself i would be interested in reading anything you 
none	 have  of arcane nature i would be especially interested in even if it was just histories of  matt that is a bit specific unfortunately we do not have anything in particular for that  liam well i will look through your fictional works and also history if you have it  laura do you know where we would go to find arcane books and stuff  matt i do not unfortunately most of that is organized by the guildmasters under the marquis  the concord generally deals with things that are of particular price points and interests i 
none	 mainly  deal with people who come to travel in and out people that want something to read when they are  going on a boat for a very long time theres not a lot of business to be made from the books you requested  liam okay well priority one is i deal in prose and poetry quite a bit so i need  a good amount of basic blank paper for my work  laura hes a really good poet  sam it all rhymes  laura mmhmm  matt have you been published  liam i am

town	 back with it he seems to be going off and probably buying it from other  friends of his like the time i remember as a kid i ordered a cheeseburger at a mexican restaurant  and it took 30 minutes to get there and i realized it was because  they went up the street to get it  liam yeah we make that yeah  matt i was a dumb 12yearold anyway  liam while he is making those trips i will find one interesting fictional work  and also any history book on nicodranas that i can

none	  top of the staircase towards where your mothers room is looks down towards you grunts  leans back and folds his arms are the rest of you going up with her or staying down there  sam and travis sure  taliesin yeah no if were all here  travis unless you want some privacy  laura no come  matt you all head up bluud puts his hand out this big meaty hand before the others and goes jester  laura mmhmm  matt leans back again his shoulders hitting the wall as jester does the classic  
none	 international symbol for let us through please  travis long established  matt yeah you come to the door  laura yeah  matt knock on it nadine opens it up glances recognizes you and goes ah right pulls the  door open lounging in her fainting couch in the far corner is your mother with a small book open  her hair is pulled and tied back tightly shes in her casual space she doesnt look like shes  expecting any clientele any time soon she glances over and looks at  laura drop it mama  matt jester

none	 out at least it was more of a marauding band of murderers on  the ship side of the docks that stole a ship but apparently killed a number of other illegal  peoples and so they write it off as illegal people doing illegal things to illegal people  laura cool  travis i think were good  matt just be careful anyway  laura hows nugget  matt oh she goes and theres what used to be your room with the double doors that close she  opens it up and pulls it open you can see all 
none	 these scratch marks on the inside of the wood the  immediate smell of dog shit and pee hits you nugget whistling all of a sudden right there  in front of you you see nugget but larger over the weeks that youve gone the tiny puppy is now  a fairly decentsized puppy halfway to full grown and even thats the size of a fairly big  dog nugget pants and jumps up into your arms and you fall back onto the ground as slurping  laura this dog got big  sam they do that  laura hi 
none	 have you been training him  matt ive been training him as much as i can hes been a bit of a handful but is very adorable  laura hes so cute  matt hes slobbering on the chest of your armor but are you taking him  laura yeah of course we are  matt wonderful wonderful i am so happy to hear that hes missed his mommy havent you havent you  laura i feel like hes known you longer though if youre going to miss him you know you can  matt no no its quite all

town	 stay in this room as  well and the other two are at your disposal i put them at my tab do not worry  travis very gracious of you  taliesin two rooms ought to cover it for us  matt just for the night  taliesin how long are we going to be maybe just a couple nights maybe at best theres a few  things we should do in town before we head  laura i dont know what were doing  liam did you want to stay for a while though a few days  laura 
none	 i mean i dont want to impose or anything you know  matt its not an imposition i just need to make sure that there are rooms  available for each progressive night  liam pardon me after tonight we could find another place give you a day or two with your mother  laura sure  matt i mean i would not argue  laura we can hang out i know theres stuff we need to do and stuff  now that were back on land i feel better  matt it is welcoming well tell me how was 
none	 your time apparently you  left under interesting circumstances  travis hurried circumstances i think would sum it up we did have to borrow a boat a ship  liam we did not bring it back  travis thats true  laura we got another boat its way cooler  sam were giving that one to orly right  laura but hes holding it for us  travis well be landlocked for a while are you familiar with darktow isle  matt i have heard of it there are stories but i have not been there of course  travis 
none	 your daughter was very brave our adventure took us over there  matt oh wow are you being serious right now  laura serious were pirates well we were  matt i had one client from darktow once told me a little bit about it  sounds like a very frightening place  laura who was the client  matt i cannot tell  laura did he have hair from another guy on  matt no  laura was he bald was he big and bald  matt no but that doesnt narrow down my clients necessarily either  laura 
none	 okay well we only met a couple people so  matt thats okay  travis yeah i dont think the plank king leaves very often  laura he could my mom is really really cool and worth traveling for  travis without a doubt our travels took us far and wide and we are all the more  excited to be back on land and to explore this beautiful city that most of us  havent had a chance to really peek about  liam you two are very curious about that tower  travis very much  marisha just 
none	 you know as a historical landmark  sam do you know that tower that gets bigger and smaller the closer you are to it  matt i assume that youre referring to the tidal  sam and marisha the tide peak  matt tide peak yes i have not been there of course but it is a mysterious place  liam what have you heard about it for fjord and beaus benefit  matt well as far as i know there is a very wealthy mage who lives there who is responsible  for the organization of the open quay 
none	 who is kind of a hermit from what ive heard but is  supposedly at least looking out for the benefit of the people who live there so as not to be  completely under the control of the monopoly of the concord thats as much as i know  travis that sounds like what weve gathered before interesting i think thats where we want  to go next you notice as you walk towards it and walk further away it looks like it grows and shrinks  marisha like a dick  travis well i was going to say 
town	 like a telescope  laura well then it would be like the tower curves down sometimes and then lifts back up  you know what i mean  liam well thats true but i feel theres a difference  sam between dicks and buildings  liam ja the movement of it  laura yeah its different  liam of course one is a building ja  matt as an expert i would say yes anyway  travis you know it goes up and down it doesnt lay over on its side and shrink up and then extend itself  marisha 
none	 what happens in the cold  matt you have been at sea for quite some time i can tell  travis im sorry yeah we got sea dementia its really rampant  matt it is all right well take your time i will ask to see if we can have a special dinner  prepared for you when you come back tonight and im happy to have you home  laura thank you  sam what time is it about now  matt at this point its later afternoon id say you probably have about another hour or so before 
none	 dusk  laura i dont think we should look at the tower  sam lets go fucking break into it right now lets go right now  laura i dont think we should do that i used up three spells already  sam so what well be fine theres nothing in there were just going to steal some stuff  liam can i make out from the spine or the cover what book she was reading that she set down  matt make a perception check  liam books books books  matt really really great for the dm  
none	 liam 21  matt sure its called hireling because that was the first word i saw on the back of my dms  screen who knows what that storys about  travis we rip it out of her hand whats the first chapter say  marisha its just a players handbook  matt the first chapters called obscured areas lightly obscured has the effect of creatures  laughter  sam shes making a game system  marisha what class do you play  travis jester makes a valid point we actually probably should go first thing in the morning  
none	 so were all nice and rested and i would enjoy a nice meal  laura yeah  marisha weve got a little bit of time we still dont know how to get into this tower maybe we  could do a little bit more research before the night is out before dinner time  laura lets go scope it out lets go stare at it a while  marisha ask questions i dont know  travis i dig it  sam bring the paint  laura yeah the paint is always with me  travis may the paint be with 
none	 you  sam caleb i promise you if we go scope it out tonight we are going in tonight  liam i dont think that is a good idea  sam have you met these people before  taliesin i would definitely prefer to wait as well im a fan of taking a minute  to take a look around and have a plan  liam we need to dial it back a little bit weve been going at an 11 out of ten  for a while we need to slow down  travis im sure there are some 
none	 stores that might have healing potions and other things we could  stock up on before the sun goes down and they close up right might as well take a gander  ms ruby do you have any sorts of shops you might recommend that would have stuff of that nature  matt if youre looking for general shops that have things that are useful in travels like that  healing potions i dont really deal with those at all there is the seafloors bounty in the open  quay if youre planning to go by the strange dick tower 
none	 then that is a possibility if not there  there is also meandering treasures in the restless wharf is a destination of interest  if thats what youre looking for odds and ends maybe  travis thats beautiful  matt there is no specialty stores in healing potions in nicodranas  travis im sure either of those will do nicely  matt all right good luck  travis shall we a little light shopping  laura lets do it i kiss her on the cheek should we take nugget with us as we go  sam please no  travis 
none	 yeah maybe not into the stores with things that break and then we have to pay for it  sam also we might be doing a covert walkby of this place  laura good idea but what if nugget could go poof and go into it  sam that could definitely happen  laura and then were like oh no my dog he went in and now i have to go in too to get him out  sam thats valid  travis hes certainly your dog jester its your call  laura lets leave him here  travis phone 
none	 i dont know how to respond to that  matt you beat me to it siri  liam what lazy roleplaying  travis yes and bitch  laughter  laura i guess we can leave him here for the time being  liam you know im going to stay here and do a little bit of reading so if you  want me to watch your dog i will  laura really do you want any company  liam while i read  laura yeah someone to stare over your shoulder and see what youre reading and talk to you 
none	 while  youre trying to  liam i feel a little uncomfortable who are we talking about you  sam no i dont like to be near when he reads he needs to focus  laura are you sure nugget wont bother you  liam no but go find out what you can about this place and get your shopping done ask about the  tower subtly  laura do you need anything  liam mm no  laura okay  matt panting  laura nugget i love you stay with caleb dont bamf away stay with him he loves 
none	 you so much  youre going to have a good time okay bye  liam watch the dog poof  matt the dog immediately they both port in opposite directions as he ports right up next to  you and pushes you over  liam okay you want to do some spell research with me come on come on frumpkin  matt frumpkin comes over slowly growling frumpkin leaps up and perches around your  shoulders taking the territory and staring at nugget  liam you are in charge you are the guard cat dont let him push you around 
none	 i start to read and write  matt all right the rest of you where are you going  sam in the interest of time are there any potions that we find around  matt you have two locations you go to  travis the seafloor bounty is over by the  laura i think we should go to the one in the open quay  matt heading to the seafloors bounty it seems to be a fairly decent general store it  specializes in pawning scavenged goods and loot and things that are found at sea or people come 
none	  upon through whatever means they come upon them near the wharf there is a female gnome who runs  it older looking the equivalent of a human 60s which means shes been around for quite some time  but very crotchety and nasty as you walk in theres one other customer who as soon as you  enter looks nervously and then exits immediately brushes past you and disappears into the now  setting sun as the gnome turns around to you yeah can i help you  sam hello  matt hello  sam hello  matt hello 
none	  sam is she mocking me  laura and travis i dont think so  laura are we disguised still were not disguised anymore  taliesin probably not probably it wore off  sam i think we need some items here why am i the face of the group hi we need some items were  looking for some potions  matt she leans over the top to look down at your alsotiny frame over the top you need potions  you said  sam potions i will also need some i was looking for some oil  matt oil 
none	  sam some oil  matt i can get you some oil sure  sam all right increasingly shrill and do you have any healing potions  matt maybe  sam shrilly weve got coin  matt thats the secret password ill be right back  sam i feel like shes mocking me  taliesin if anything youre mocking her  matt she leaps off her stool and vanishes behind the counter you hear the footsteps walk away and  go into a back chamber and youre left alone on the floor in the room for a second  laura 
none	 whoa do we see anything cool  taliesin anything interesting on the wall  matt theres all sorts of interesting decorative scabbards containing what you assume to be a blade  decorating the walls you can see large conch shells and various sea trophies that were taken  from people making the journey all across the swavain islands  sam anything shiny  matt make a perception check  sam eight  matt theres a few shiny things  taliesin just for fun detect magic  matt okay  laura yeah  matt you cast detect magic  taliesin anything 
none	 sparkly  matt looking around in the room you get some faint magical glow or a sense from behind the  counter nothing on display theres probably a reason for that  taliesin thats fair anything behind the counter look particularly interesting  matt are you going to look over behind the counter  taliesin yeah i mean  laura youre tall  taliesin as long as i can im not going to break a rule or anything but yeah  matt okay you glance over and look and tucked underneath there is a small wooden case its  closed 
none	 currently it looks maybe about two foot by one foot maybe six or seven inches high and  thats whats giving you the faint magical aura  taliesin all right  matt okay a few moments pass and you hear some more footsteps come in and another heft onto  the stool again she steps up and she has a small satchel that you hear the clanking of crystal or  glass on the inside okay i have three healing potions i could muster is that what you want  sam how much are they  matt what  sam 
none	 louder how much are they  matt 60 gold apiece  sam quietly that fair  laura i dont think so  sam well take them  matt all right pay up  sam sure  travis ill buy one  sam thank you anybody else chipping in  taliesin ill chip in for this yeah  laura i dont need them i can heal people on my own  sam you can  laura yeah  taliesin i mean we should distribute them to other people  marisha ill chip in for one 60 gold  laura oh yeah 
none	 thats a good point  taliesin ill chip in for how many do we have now  laura three  matt just the three basic potions  taliesin three basic healing potions ill chip in for one  marisha yeah lets buy them out  sam do you have any flammable oils  matt theres oil how much do you need  sam enough for a larger flask something that i could make a long line of oil with if i needed to  matt all right thatll run you 40 gold pieces  laura whoa  sam ill take 
none	 it  matt all right she jumps off the stool and this takes a while you start hearing heavy  clanging of metal and things dropping in the back you glance around the corner and theres a slight  curtain and it looks like shes just emptying out lanterns into a vial just pouring one after  another after another into this small jug and eventually corking it comes out careful now  sam thank you  matt youre welcome thank you  sam what is your name again  matt sheila  sam sheila  matt sheila bobsnopper  
none	 sam sheila plobs  matt bobsnopper  sam bobsnopper  taliesin miss sheila i had a question  matt whats your question  taliesin i was curious about any magical items you might have for sale i got a vibe that you  might have something here that might be interesting  matt nothing for sale sorry  taliesin do you have anything thats not for sale thats just for show  matt not for show  laura what do you have thats secret  matt none of your business  laura gasps okay  matt trust me you dont 
none	 want to be the kind of person that comes in here and gets a chance to see it  laura oh its a weapon  matt maybe  laura is it a wand  matt i dont play this game missy  taliesin is that a yes or no on the  matt are you casing my joint  laura hmm  matt i said are you casing my joint  laura what  matt what  laura huh  matt are you grunt  taliesin what is casing  sam do you buy things as well maam  matt 
none	 yes i do what do you have something to sell  sam i have some studded leather armor that i dont need any more  matt oh show it to me  sam all right get it out of the haversack heres some old studded armor studded leather  matt she reaches down and takes a cloth and starts cleaning off the bits of grime and stuff on  it takes a few minutes to inspect it the interior seeing how it fits together and belts  thats a good set not too bad for sale let me look at 
none	 the price here singing studded  leather armor  sam says 45 on thats new though  matt ill give you 15 gold for it  sam ill take it  laura groans  matt all right here you go  laura ugh it hurts me  matt so you take 15 gold back she goes and throws it in a pile in the corner is that it  anything else she narrows her eyes at you  laura grumpily no nothing else  matt narrows even harder at you  laura i dont think she likes us caduceus  
none	 taliesin thats nonsense were very likeable is there something in your eyes do you have a  problem i can  laura are you tired are you falling  matt im always tired im just tired of you coming in here being nosy get your friends out  i like you you you can all piss off  taliesin this is why you did the talking have a nice day  sam we chose wisely  matt bye bye  sam nice to meet you whatever byebye i liked her she was nice  travis a real spitfire  sam 
none	 she was great bobsnopper  laura bobstomper  matt bobsnopper  travis i got a feeling she had more fight in her than youd think  laura yeah i bet she could do some damage  travis so before the sun goes all the way down  laura were going to sneak into her shop and steal whats behind the counter  travis i was going to say lets go look at the tower  laura yeah all right  sam we could probably kill her  matt i love the prospect of you finally coming back to nicodranas and 
none	 immediately just fucking  everything up again  travis everythings chill  marisha two hours  matt do what you want mind you  taliesin finally calmed down everythings fine this is a holdup empty your wallets  matt why not embrace destiny  travis lets make our way over to the what was it  marisha the wayfarers cove the open quay  laura were in the open quay  sam the tide peak the tower right  matt yeah easy to find the tower is visible by now at this point in time the sun is in the 
dung	  process of setting so the sky has transitioned now into its vibrant oranges and reds and across  the way on the other side of the horizon the dark blues and purples are starting to take but there  it is the dark shadow of the monolithic tower of tide peak visible the closer you get the taller  it becomes and the taller it becomes until what looks to be maybe hundreds of floors up its  absurd how tall it looks from the base floor  laura how wide is it though  matt id say its 
none	 maybe no more than 50 feet across 50 feet wide  sam fjord  travis mmhmm  sam dont you have an ability where you can disappear and reappear a few feet somewhere else  travis sure do  sam could you not do that and just be quickly inside  laura what if you get stuck  travis if i look up is that balcony that we saw before about 15 20 feet above our heads  matt that balcony is not visible  marisha what do you mean its not there anymore  matt yeah  marisha did 
none	 we do that  travis did what make it appear and disappear  marisha i dont know  travis do a quick speed round and we walk around the perimeter looking out for fucking windows and  balconies and we meet around the other side  matt okay yeah you go around and where the balcony was last time theres nothing its  solid in fact there are no windows for about 60 or so feet up and then you see a balcony similar  to the one you saw but it is shorter like truncated on each side  
none	 travis oh how high up  matt about 50 or 60 feet up  travis 50 to 60 yeah thats too high i mean i can get up there but it makes a real big noise  sam but you could just disappear and reappear inside the wall couldnt you  travis i mean i dont know whats inside there  marisha yeah could you get stuck  travis yep and it would hurt a lot i imagine just from my simple knowledge of basic physics  sam im just a caveman  travis yep  sam all right  
none	 marisha no doors nothing  travis but hey theres nothing that says if we come back in the morning that son of a bitch  might be in a different place ill bet you crackfire slopdolly  sam what  taliesin i dont even  laughter  sam hick queens  travis spits  matt dimplewood  travis yeah pick wood  marisha i get this feeling that this is all a forced perspective thing like an illusion what  if we get in there and its actually just a shack  travis theres no way thats not possible  
none	 marisha maybe hes an enthusiast of tiny homes  travis and it just looks like it grows and shrinks and grows and shrinks  marisha compensating  travis maybe  marisha i dont know just a theory  travis i cant get up there without making a real loud ruckus so tomorrow mornings our best bet  sam jester could get us up there  liam im not here but just out of curiosity the change in size is it slight that you just barely  notice it or is it like whoa whoa  matt its whoa whoa unless 
none	 youre watching it the whole time so its like oh well head  that way and you walk and all of a sudden youre at the base and you look up and youre  like whoa why is it so tall if youre watching it which i imagine you probably were as  you were heading through the open quay its pretty immediate meaning within about 500 feet or  so the transition really hits from any distance in the city it just looks like any other large  tower though it looks like one of the more visible and 
none	 apparent ones across the skyline it  isnt until you get within 500 feet that all of a sudden it drastically seems to grow  liam so its impressiveness is in the extreme when youre right there with it  matt correct  liam okay  sam caduceus has a tree  travis what about the tree  laura what about blink oh thats fucking hot when you put a hot thing in it ow  matt metal is funny when it conducts heat oh laura you okay  laura yeah im fine  travis what about the tree  
none	 sam caduceus dont you have a magic tree  taliesin am i there  matt i mean unless you havent gone with them  taliesin i was trying to remember if wed split for the two i do have a magic tree  travis but how does that work  taliesin i drop it on the ground and a 60foot tree immediately appears  travis immediately  taliesin yep  laura wouldnt that be a bit obvious  marisha and travis yeah  sam not if we ride it up to the top then leave someone behind to chop it 
none	 down real quick  taliesin its a five foot thick tall tree  travis thats a shitty plan  marisha i mean what do we want out of this right  sam to be inside  marisha yeah but then what to immediately be arrested and thrown out of nicodranas  sam profit  travis well theres no rule that says dont ride up a tree and jump on a fucking balcony  marisha no there definitely is its called breaking and entering there is a rule about that  laura cant we just knock on the door  travis 
none	 and sam theres no door  laura cant we just knock on the wall  travis try it  laura i did  matt okay you knock on the wall  laura uhhuh  marisha whats it sound like  matt it sounds like youre knocking on hard stone and it hurts your knuckle a little bit  travis can i turn around and look at the storefront unless something happens when she knocks  matt at the moment nothing  travis i turn around and look at the storefronts are there any that are obviously still open right  
none	 across from maybe that are facing the  matt there is one that looks to be a small fish market its not huge by any means it looks like  its open but its probably going to be closing fairly soon probably when the sun goes  travis can i just jog over and try and find somebody that might be working a desk over there  taliesin while he does that im going to just walk the tower with my hand on the tower and see  if i feel any change at all  matt as youre doing 
none	 that you hear a door creaking on the opposite side on the tower  marisha sound of running feet walking casual  matt all right as you hear it slowly open up this little hand curls around the outside short  maybe around kneeheight for you fjord as the door peeks open you see a male goblin really  well dressed in a tiny little accountants outfit where its doublebreasted to one side  with a nice lapel has small spectacles across the bulbous and pointed nose no hair the  teeth which characteristically of a goblin tend to overlap 
none	 and protrude have been really  wellkept very wellgroomed goblin pokes around the corner hello  laura hi  marisha hello  matt can i help you  laura can he help us  taliesin we were hoping to make an appointment with  marisha with yussa yussa errenis it would be really fantastic to talk to him  matt do you have an appointment  sam we were going to make one  marisha yes or at least if you can inform us how to make an appointment  matt he relaxes a second after the chest is puffed 
none	 up his presentation relaxes and the  gut puffing underneath the outfit as he no longer feels that he needs to put on a  presentation he goes well let me take a look at the book hold on just a second  he closes the door behind him  laura can we still see the door  matt you can see the door yeah it wasnt there when you walked around previously  marisha maybe its his assistant  laura what does the door look like  matt it looks like a standard door its circular at the top 
none	 it looks like its wood slats metal  crossbars hold it all together theres no handle or knocker it appears to only open from the inside  laura whoa  travis what knockers young frankenstein just to be clear  matt oh yeah a few moments pass the door opens up again and he has a tiny leather journal  and he all right soonest that weve got here pulls it back the soonest weve got here lets see  about 17 months three weeks and four days  taliesin is it possible to maybe move that up into a 
town	 very quick emergency meeting  matt whats the emergency  taliesin we have to leave town and will not back for quite a while  laura yeah  matt well come back in a number of months  taliesin its time sensitive  laura we could all be dead  matt make a persuasion check actually no make a deception check because this is  taliesin i have genuine questions for this person  matt but youre pushing that this is an emergency do you consider it an emergency  taliesin for the things i want okay im boasting a 
none	 little deception right  matt im going to call you on that  taliesin all right thats fair  laura im boasting a little  taliesin eight  matt mistrustful noise  taliesin does the blooming grove mean anything  matt not to me  laura but it might to the dude you work for  marisha listen im sure youve heard about the war thats happening in the empire  matt yes  marisha we have reason to believe that people with magical interests might be threatened in this  time of war and having heard that oohsah might 
none	 be a man magical prowess we thought that he might  have some information or at least we could hand off our fair warning  matt ill tell you what yussa has bedded down for the evening you want to come by tomorrow  morning maybe hes in a particularly good mood and could spare you a minute or two of his time  but as of right now i cannot force a meeting at dusk with a few unknowns with no particular truth  to their purpose wanting to bypass our entire system of entry so have a good 
none	 night and hope for  a better tomorrow  marisha what was your name  matt door closes  marisha tomorrow morning  travis im at the fish mart  matt yep  sam what  travis im at the fish mart  sam oh jesus  taliesin with an axe in your hand going who are you  matt the fishmonger at the fish mart right now is going like i know its fucking weird right  it scares me i dont like it  travis you dont see a particular door that appears every couple of days or 
none	 is there a pattern  matt yeah it does when they come in and out but then its gone its really creepy i dont like it  travis yeah all right youre an observant one anything else that you can share that might help  me understand this structure more  laura coos what does the guy look like coos  travis pigeons really unsanitary for these fish  matt i want to help you i can say that there is a very nice special on red snapper  travis how much  matt well for the entire fish were 
none	 looking at least three silver  travis ill flip him four silver  matt well there you are its a sizable snapper  taliesin to be fair you probably havent had meat in quite a while because i havent been  cooking it  travis wrapped in the paper stuff right or is it just the fish  matt for the extra silver you get paper  travis oh thank you  matt wraps it up for you  travis very appreciative you have yourself a fancy fucking evening  matt at this point the door is closed and you

none	 no its true but we need to figure out how were going to talk our way into this place tomorrow  laura you should have said something nott  sam i tried but the little guy got away before i spoke  travis what little guy  sam there was a little goblin guy which by the way none of you should trust  laura but why  sam he will turn around and stab you in the back the second youre not looking  laura why will he do that  sam because hes a goblin  travis i 
none	 grab the snapper by the tail and i start gesturing let me get this straight i went to ask  questions you knocked and some goblin came out of what the balcony and started answering your  questions and then disappeared  sam the front door cant you see it right there  travis is it still there  matt at this point as you guys are all talking and you look back the door is not there anymore  travis you motherfuckers i dont need this shit i toss it like seaworld  marisha toss it like seaworld

none	  things being difficult maybe i just make things difficult  travis no i dont think thats it  marisha maybe im having a moment of selfrealization  travis lets not do that  taliesin ride it i approve of this this is great  marisha anyway  travis so we come back in the morning  sam were going to need some information to give to get in  travis what information  sam i dont know something that would make a powerful mage want to talk to us we need to know  a magical secret  travis 
none	 ukotoa  sam or talk to him about ukotoa  marisha we have a ton of magical secrets  laura and marisha we also have the dodecahedron  marisha we have the happy fun time ball  laura oh my gosh the happy fun time ball  marisha we witnessed an attack on another wizards tower in zadash i wasnt lying when i  said magic people might be under attack  sam thats true these are all truths  marisha i know  laura what if you know how all these things were stolen from people  travis uhhuh 
none	  laura what if maybe they were stolen from this guy  travis we walk in and we say are you missing anything  laura but then well have to give it back to him  sam not without money  laura no its his wed have to give it back thats how it works here in nicodranas  travis that might be okay though jester what if we give it back and he answers us some amazing  questions or  laura i dont want questions i want to go back to the fappy  liam oh my god 
none	  laura the happy fun time ball there are so many secrets there the fappy fun time ball  matt thats a true artifact to be fair  liam as jester i will never come out again  travis well maybe we dont offer that right away  marisha i dont think we have to offer the dodecahedron either we have our eyewitness  accounts of  sam caleb will know what to say  laura caleb should have been here  travis yeah and we really should go back and get some good dinner and some sleep so we 
none	 can get  back here tootsweet  marisha dont get me wrong caleb is very smart i know we all know that  sam with magic especially  marisha but you guys have noticed hes not necessarily the best talker right  sam hes an amazing talker hes charming and handsome  taliesin i think also since you seem to be leaning towards honesty im always a big fan of  honesty being the best way to approach these or as much of the truth as is possible at any moment  marisha well you can justify anything  taliesin 
none	 im always happier to omit than lie if we have to lyings weird  marisha i feel like were bonding why have you never told me this before you should  have led with that  taliesin huh i dont know what that means but i agree  sam get a room  laura we have one lets go back to it  taliesin too much has been happening here  matt so you guys return to the lavish chateau  liam how long were roughly did all this mess last before they come back how long have i  
none	 been in the room  matt well it depends if you guys are going back are you  travis and sam were going back  matt so theyve been gone for roughly id say two hours  liam ugh okay  marisha is that bad  taliesin potion i bought is for caleb so caleb gets the healing potion  matt you have a standard healing potion caleb  liam im busy come back later  taliesin were going to the tower tomorrow  matt do you still have the fish or did you eat the fish  sam i 
none	 ate just a part of the tail but the rest of is a little chewed on but in paper for dinner  matt the chef offers to prepare that as your dinner is already being set for the rest of the  group at the request of the ruby  liam i would have been in whatever chambers were given to us so if caduceus came in with that  potion i barely nodded and just kept doing what i was doing  matt by the way calebs hair is this cowlick mess where its perpetual dog tongue  licking 
none	 the entire time that hes been having to concentrate on his business  liam frumpkin is bushed out the tail is bushed out its all over and is just staring at nugget  laura as soon as i come home i go nugget home  matt dog panting then jumps towards you but from ten feet and then appears right in front of  you and knocks you into the wall  laura i love him were home  matt marion comes and greets you guys dinner is prepared meal is enjoyed and you all prepare  yourselves to bed

town	 about ukotoa  liam what door what are you talking about  sam we talked about this over dinner last night  liam no i didnt eat with you  sam we definitely did we had a big dinner anyway  laura you didnt come to the dinner at all caleb  liam no  sam hes just being coy we need a story to get us past the fucking goblinman whos keeping us from  getting in the tower something to share something that his master yussa errenis would find yussaful  liam before we go down that road 
none	 may i ask what is our actual purpose that we are  not telling him about why are we doing this  travis i want to see the inside  laura im pretty sure its just because we think its cool  sam i have an actual reason  liam ja  sam a powerful mage with access to magical spells and books  liam so we are going to go in and case the joint to rob him blind  sam no maybe we just take a few books  laura maybe hes really nice and he wants to 
dung	 be our best friend  taliesin i have some legitimate questions about things that i am curious about and we do actually  own some objects that maybe we should have a learned man take a look at  marisha we told him it was an emergency so we still have to go forward with that  taliesin mine is  marisha for you  taliesin yeah  marisha but what is going to be an emergency for a man thats not threatened  by the things that youre threatened by  travis ukotoa  taliesin there seems to be 
none	 a lot of weird things happening  marisha is no one into talking about the tower getting attacked in zadash  sam its true and its impending danger i like that one a lot  liam i do too there is a war brewing in the empire it is going to spill south that is not a  lie that is an inevitability so i feel that we can talk to him and trust me no one in this room  is more curious about the inside of that tower than i am but to what end are we doing 
none	 this like  are we going to go to the hilt are we going to slay this mage and take his books or make nice  conversation and steal a book it seems like  marisha we could just make nice conversation and ask for a book oh god  im starting to sound like caduceus  travis yeah you better watch yourself  laura no that didnt really sound like him very much  taliesin you can be a lot lower  liam caduceus is very soothing to listen to  travis id like to know what he knows 
none	 if he knows more about ukotoa  or maybe how to counteract him  sam thats right there is still one ukotoa gate out there that we dont know where it is  maybe this mage knows where it is  travis maybe hes up for a friendly conversation i dont think were your average fisherman  i mean weve seen some shit  liam well i am curious and beauregard is correct that it is something we could legitimately  talk about without spilling the beans about everything that everyone has got going on with  themselves and i 
none	 am of course curious i just want to make sure you know ive talked about  calculated risks before and i dont want to run willynilly towards folly like we have done with  the boat we are all standing here but that was foolish  marisha look at the end of the day this guy has access right making him our ally  in some way could come in useful even in ways we might not be aware yet  laura what do you think yasha  matt well i mean do what youre going to do just try 
none	 not to get us killed by a wizard please  laura good call  travis yep of the utmost importance  marisha shes so poignant when she speaks  liam we just dont need to be too pushy  all no  sam we all have questions and theres a lot of unknowns out there and if this person could check  off just one of the boxes then that would be worth it maybe we make an ally and he  can check off more than one box tell us about the dodecahedron  travis check off a bunch 
none	 of boxes  liam yeah well potentially he could turn us over to people that we are not interested in  turned over to but im not saying no lets just be careful thats all  travis yeah fair enough  marisha well this guy is anticlovis concord so i dont know i dont think hes  laura i worry that hes going to do something to you caleb personally  liam i dont think so  marisha i have a feeling this guy is a bit of a rogue agent in terms of right  because the clovis concord 
none	 sorry a little repeat of the concord  matt the clovis concord is a union of all the various citystates that make up  marisha and matt the menagerie coast  matt correct  marisha theyre like the government for menagerie  matt yes while each city is locally governed in and of itself for the marquis that run all the  various merchant guilds its very much a guildcentric government  marisha like an oligarchy  matt kind of  liam like the early colonies here  matt yeah in a way but all the marquis work together to 
none	 maintain a generally consistent rule  of law and maintain peace and order through that  marisha theyre anti this guy because hes outside of their  matt you dont know how they feel about him but from what you heard from the ruby is that  he seems to be the one person who wont sell their house in the neighborhood  to get the train tracks built you know that kind of thing  marisha i just wrote down the chagrin of the clovis concord so im assuming thats what she said  travis youre there  matt 
none	 there you go  travis so who did the knocking last time  marisha jester  travis did you do anything special  laura yeah it was a real special knock  travis can you replicate it today  laura i think i can  travis then get after it  laura are we right in front of the tower  sam we are  liam we had a walkandtalk just now  matt as you guys have been walking and talking towards the tower in the early morning hours  travis powerwalking  matt all right as you guys 
none	 make your way to the open quay you approach the tower all right you knock  laura take notes fjord knock knock knock  travis grabbed her elbow  matt theres a pause can i help you  laura wait does that not sound like a goblin where is it  sam is it on our side or around the  matt youre hearing it around you  laura look up  matt you see about 30 feet up that balcony that was there originally is there and standing at the  edge of it you see a figure hard 
none	 to see at this angle and this distance but a figure is there  with long dull golden robes holding a small teacup and a saucer glancing  over the edge and looking down  taliesin we were hoping for an audience if you have time this morning  matt you just happened to approach and knock for an audience  taliesin we came by yesterday and we were told it might be best to come back  in the morning we brought tea  matt did you make an appointment with wensfeld  taliesin yes he said to come 
none	 back in the morning  marisha its an emergency  laura we have really good tea  marisha earl grey  matt both of you make persuasion checks  travis damn it  taliesin we dont have earl grey i dont think  sam first good roll of the night  travis we do have earl  laura 21  marisha natural one we dont have earl grey  sam thats true  taliesin we dont  matt well it appears that you have not made an appointment and you do not  have the tea that you are promising 
none	  laura but we have better tea than that  taliesin im a fine teamaker  sam give him some information  travis we also have news of grave import  marisha from zadash from the empire  sam dangerous information  matt then please would you be so kind as to present me with this dangerous information  laura dont you want our tea though  sam we might not want to shout it in the streets up to you  matt you dont have to shout it you notice that his voice is a whisper  even though 
none	 hes 30 feet away from you  taliesin we feel a bit exposed i would admit  matt youre safe theres some sort of amplification to his voice and its placing it  omnipresent around you at this low volume like hes right there  liam can we tell from where we are if hes human or elven or  matt make a perception check  liam 21  matt glancing up he appears to be elven a darker complexion which is different from the  elves of bysaes tyl up in the empire which come from the north near 
none	 uthudurn which was mentioned  before so this is probably an elf from gwardan which is one of the coastal cities here which  originated from marquet long ago like a lot of the menagerie coast did  taliesin mr deep lore  laura knows it all  matt some people have hobbies i stay at home and write this  taliesin im going to pull a pouch of my better tea and im not really sure what to do with it  sam give him some info  taliesin have you ever heard of the blooming grove  matt 
none	 he takes a second im sure that its crossed my path but it is not in my  immediate peripheral  taliesin this tea is made from a flower that only grows there in the north  from one of the original families its very rare  matt choose one and enter  laura whispers just one person gets to go in  matt you look down to talk amongst yourselves and theres a door on the wall that wasnt there  when your attention was faced away from it  travis we all bumrush it no im good im 
none	 not fucking with this one  matt and you punch fjord for no reason  marisha eliminate your enemies  sam quietly maybe take someone who can get word out  taliesin youre making a big assumption that word can leave  sam and travis thats true  taliesin lets not its either probably you or me i suppose i dont know  travis you plus one  sam you plus one you get a plus one  laura oh i thought it was just choose one  matt he was telling him to choose one and enter so there 
none	 is a plus one  laura oh there is a plus one  taliesin lets get all the things we might want to show him together really quickly  sam what might we want to show him  taliesin i want the dodecahedron  laura i dont want to show him the dodecahedron  sam no  laura singing but you can look at it and get a little lucky luck  marisha maybe hell see us looking at it  liam did he just hear that entire conversation  matt probably  taliesin well talk about it  travis 
none	 three notes are ask about ukotoa i trust you make good decisions  sam is there any evidence do we have any items from the xhorhasian the crick that we found  taliesin we have the  laura dont call him a  taliesin do you trust me  laura well yeah but i dont know him  taliesin okay you keep it but  sam do you want fappy fun ball  taliesin yes please  sam you do want fappy fun ball  taliesin yes please  sam should we give him fappy fun ball  travis yep 
none	  taliesin and i may with your permission mention what we have thank you  laura dont lose this okay  travis what is it  laura thats the fappy fun ball  taliesin only if it leads to something better  laura caduceus  taliesin try and be good  sam caduceus just bringing this up you know that beau ruins every situation shes in  laura you dont do that beau  sam and is horribly abrasive to talk to and sometimes look at  laura thats not true youre beautiful and youre also really nice  taliesin 
none	 i feel like between beau and i we cover everything very well  sam youre not taking the dodecahedron in right  laura and taliesin no  sam but one of you should look at it before you go in  laura yeah thats what i said  taliesin i dont need it  travis youve got some high charisma right  laura look at it beau  laura just for a minute look at it  marisha i look up at yussa is he watching  matt yeah  sam you should take caleb hes a master of magic 
none	  taliesin no were going in  travis yeah go in go thats your fate  marisha i go in  matt as you reach out theres no handle for the door you place your hand on it and it opens  inside as soon as you look within and the rest of you can see around the rather hulking form of  caduceus which you have to duck to get through the doorway on the inside it looks to be a very  simple sitting room a den you can see two couches facing each other at an angle 
none	 with a deep  redbrown maroon upholstery to it a velvety texture  marisha before we went in i wanted to can i bring frumpkin  matt youve got to do that now because youre walking in  marisha yep frumpkin  liam what  marisha give me frumpkin  liam for what  marisha do you not want to see in this  matt the door is closing behind caduceus  marisha fuck it ill leave he wont give me his damn cat  matt you enter behind caduceus on the inside there is a singular staircase that spirals 
none	 down  from the upper floor maybe about 15 feet up theres this set of two couches a small table  theres already a small platter that has a couple of small teacups and a teakettle of some kind  taliesin brewed or unbrewed just ready to be brewed  matt you dont know the rest of the chamber has no windows its all locked off there is a  chandelier above very simple metal ring that has these glass baubles placed in six different places  along it that give a soft pulsing similar to firelight a warm orange 
dung	 glow its a nice dark  comfortable den atmosphere what do you guys do  taliesin im going to check to see if theres tea brewed and if there isnt ill brew tea  matt there is no tea brewed  taliesin i will brew some tea  matt all right as you begin that process you hear the soft footsteps beginning to descend the  stairs and there you see the figure come down it is a male elf lightbrown tan skin the hair is  short cut very short in the back and it curls up into this 
none	 side wave jet not jet jetwhite  is not a thing stark white hair and very chiseled features but you can see the crows nest  wrinkles coming in from what elves youve seen this is a very old elf of what age begins to come  through there are a lot of years on this elf shorter than most elves that youve seen probably  comes to about maybe five feet maybe a little under that the robes themselves have a golden  shimmer that looks like the threads themselves may actually be gold or something that very much 
none	  mimics the properties of gold as he steps down the rest of the robe drags down the spiral  he comes and sits on are you both sitting at the same couch  marisha sure  matt all right he goes and quietly sits in the one across sits back there is a stoic  emotionless face there head cocked to the side out of curiosity well while you finish your tea  you have promised what is this emergency you have brought to my attention  and interrupted my morning routine for  marisha i deeply you have 
none	 a morning routine oh thats impressive sorry deeply apologize for  interrupting were from zadash we are a hired mercenary group here to deliver very specific  information from zadash about an attack that happened on the zauber spire  matt and at whose behest have you been hired to deliver this information to me  marisha well it is a joint effort between the hall of erudition and the cobalt soul  matt he eyes you very closely  marisha a lot of people are banding together now that war is on the home front  so unlikely alliances 
none	 are happening all across the continent  matt so part of this is requesting alliance with the cobalt soul  marisha just a friendly passing off of information  matt very well is the tea ready  taliesin the tea is indeed ready  matt how wonderful pour it if you do not mind thank you  marisha of course if you would like to discuss alliances  taliesin stick to what we know for now  matt it is quite good  taliesin thank you ill leave some extra for later  matt id appreciate it blooming grove yes 
none	 is there a name to this one  taliesin that family was one of the first four i think it may have been the graves actually  which is ironic the more i think about it each tea is made mystically from a family  that is buried within our graveyard  matt this i recall since you brought it up yes thank you continue please  marisha yes i guess just a friendly passing of information and that maybe you would  like to exchange information in return if you might know anything  matt well offer your information 
none	 and if there is something i can offer that seems  relative or involved i will be happy to pass it along as well  marisha fantastic thank you uh  laughter  marisha trying real hard here guys  travis yes good excellent  marisha well as we mentioned the xhorhasian army has breached into the empire we witnessed  an attack from crick assassins on the tower  taliesin i didnt i was told  marisha sorry he wasnt with us at the time but the rest of us did witness an attack and  encountered the xhorhasian 
none	 ourselves  matt this was the assault on the trispire correct  marisha correct i see youve heard  matt word gets around in certain circles  marisha beyond that weve recently heard that the xhorhasians have reached felderwin  matt ive heard this as well  marisha our group has been on the ocean in search for further information on behalf of the empire  matt the ocean seems a strange place to seek for information when the xhorhasians  are fighting in the east  marisha youre not wrong we got word halfway through in a jungle that 
none	 a lesser god that likes  to go by the name of ukotoa might have some sway in everything thats going on  matt ukotoa is a mythological entity in the history of the kinau the people who were of this  coast before the marquesians came so ive heard of it but it has been long gone  marisha i dont think so i think hes on the verge of returning and i think there  might be followers and patrons who might be aiding that cause  matt you think this ukotoa is connected to this war in 
none	 the east  marisha we have reason to believe that maybe some xhorhasian spies and soldiers  might be worshipers of ukotoa  taliesin there are a lot of strange things all happening in congruence  matt there are strange things happening all across exandria at any given time to find the  threads that truly tie them that takes an insightful mind continue  travis nervous laugh fuck  marisha weve received a vision through mystical means that i do not feel comfortable sharing of a  potential location for where ukotoa is captured a jungle landscape somewhere on 
none	 the continent  you wouldnt happen to have any ideas would you  matt well to be honest there are many jungle landscapes on this coast i have not heard  anything of ukotoas location nor is it of any particular interest to me at the moment  marisha okay  sam quietly next  marisha beyond that  laura checking the boxes checking the boxes  marisha we found a thing  sam yep  matt tell me of this thing you found  marisha aside which thing should i tell him about  taliesin start with the least 
none	 interesting and work your way up i suppose  marisha it was presented to us as the happy fun time ball  taliesin i actually have it if i recall i grabbed it from you im going to put it on the table  matt you see his fingers trace a few small gestures in the air speaking very quietly under his breath  laura and all three of you bamf to  laughter  travis a bright green dragon  matt interesting  taliesin odd  matt how did you come about this  marisha stumbled upon us through 
none	 a little girl i think she thought it was a toy  taliesin things keep stumbling upon us  matt how does this connect to the war in the east  taliesin things that should not be things are becoming misplaced that should not be misplaced i  feel like that fact that we have this means that a powerful magic user is no longer available people  of great power going missing and getting attacked the tower all these things  matt you are not wrong the individual who this belongs to however  has been missing for quite 
none	 some time  taliesin apparently if i recall is no longer with us now  matt well there is no confirmation of that but has not been seen in many many years  marisha seems like everyone is getting butterfingers with their magical items or magical folk  matt interesting  taliesin theres more im going to show the sword just because this is odd  and there was also the grove is dying  matt is this related to the corruption from malaismere  taliesin i dont know perhaps i asked the wildmother for guidance and it brought  
none	 me to this that certainly sparks my interest  matt if i recall this blooming grove exists in the savalierwood correct  taliesin yes  matt the fact that its been able to resist the corruption of the forest this long  is in itself a testament to its guardians  taliesin do you know anything of its sister temples of whether they hold or not if  matt i do not think that is my specialty unfortunately i am not a purveyor of faith  taliesin there is no reason for this magic to be diminishing its very odd 
none	  why would it be diminishing  matt i could not tell you perhaps it was an imperfect enchantment or perhaps the magic that  holds sway over the savalierwood is growing stronger but that would be  taliesin that would be odd in itself  matt it would but unfortunately that is beyond my specialties  marisha do you not find it concerning that the savalierwood is on the  borderlines of the xhorhasian empire  matt it is on the borders actually of the greying wildlands in the north it is closer to  the empire than it 
none	 is xhorhas so it would a bigger threat to the king bertrand dwendal than  it would be to any of the kryn dynasty  marisha mmhmm yeah i actually knew that  matt but it seems to only spread through the forest and seems to be proximity to malaismeres  ruins so it has been that way for a number of centuries if there is a sign of it expanding into  the pearlbow wilderness then that is something you should definitely let the king know but i do not  know of any signs of that once again 
none	 i do not mean to rush you but  taliesin the last thing well i dont know im not going to say it because youre the smart one  but i think perhaps it is worth mentioning the thing you saw when the tower fell the thing that  was being ferretted the thing you saw i dont know how to best describe it  marisha im sure you have very keen eyes and you saw the artifact that i was looking at  before i entered into this tower  matt i saw something i do not know the 
none	 nature of it  marisha it appears to be a magical geometric orb that has the ability to bend  elements of time and space and fate  matt these are radical claims that you make  marisha ive seen into it  matt how much capability does it have how did you come upon it these are now two extremely  powerful things in your grasp that you seem to not have a full understanding of its capabilities  that is dangerous  taliesin i think that would be a longer conversation for when you have time if you 
none	 feel  like investing in what were doing and how were moving about the world  marisha we mentioned we were not your ordinary folk so as you can see  things happen to fall into our lap  matt and you bring them to me why  marisha we need allies  taliesin we need people who are better than ourselves  marisha as you mentioned we have very powerful artifacts that were not very sure about but our  options are turning them over to the empire which doesnt seem attractive  matt so you are from the 
none	 empire you are of the cobalt soul in zadash but you are not aligned  with the dwendalian empire yourself where are your allegiances  marisha depends  taliesin to the wildmother  matt and you  marisha depends on whos offering at the time  matt so you have no allegiances you can be bought any which way depending on the offer  taliesin she has allegiances to us  marisha correct  matt that does not inspire trust  marisha i know  matt i want to know the individuals that i would work with can be trusted 
none	  marisha i tend to like fellow trustworthy people even though im not necessarily trustworthy  myself but ironically i fucking hate untrustworthy people  so if youre down im down is what im saying  matt what are the terms youre offering  taliesin as ive spent some time with these people they are people of the world but ive  found ms beau and the rest of them to be loyal to each other which i find to be a very admirable trait  matt but she says she has no loyalty unless the world pulls her in 
none	 a direction  marisha no i didnt say i didnt have loyalty i said i had loyalty to these people  liam oh god i need to stress eat get it open  matt but that is indeed a loyalty then  marisha of course and i have a few slots open in my loyalty bank so if youre  willing to pay the price of rental  matt at this point a voice comes around the corner from the staircase above that goes sir  just got some sort of a and the goblin starts running he goes not 
none	 now wensfeld  turns back up the steps  taliesin ms beau is not as used to speaking plainly as some of us are its okay one of your  better attributes is your ability to talk around something we need friends we need assurances  we would like to know that you are a good and trustworthy person and we would respectfully  like to trade perhaps some information and have a friendly face on the coast  we would be most grateful for  matt so what you are saying is you are a band of unaligned roving 
none	 mercenaries in search of  alliances outside of the political interests of this current conflict  marisha yeah  taliesin yes the others do not know i believe how things may change soon and i think it would be  good and i think theyre going to turn well i think theyre going to turn out very well but i  think it would be good to have the right people in the corner when it is time  matt then what do you hope to gain from my alliance  taliesin information for the moment  matt about  
none	 taliesin about the things in our possession powers that we are tapping into  the people we may come across  matt and eventually what favors would you be asking  marisha we all know corruption runs rampant in both the empire and the clovis concord  i dont want anything to do with that i just want the truth  matt make a persuasion check  marisha this is not my fucking best im better at lying thats not too bad 18  matt you see his right eye just and both of you being relatively insightful people you 
none	 see  just this faint twitch at the corner of the right eye at the mention of the concord he goes  my loyalty is something that is gradually earned this is as much as youve earned and he looks to  the room there are many floors in this tower with more loyalty earned perhaps youll see more  of my tower but for now and he looks over to the door the door opens up the rest of your  friends can enter lets have a conversation  travis did that door just fucking open  sam i 
none	 think so  laura can we go in does it mean we can go in are they coming out  sam crossbow cocking  travis falchion summoning  liam caleb puts away the romance novel that he has sped read halfway through  sam i drop the fish that i was halfdone eating  taliesin our host is aware of our positions and otherwise i would ask that everyone try and be  respectful of the space try not to break anything steal anything or otherwise  laura most definitely  taliesin try not to  laura i walk in 
none	 very politely  matt all right as you guys enter again the rest of the group  liam its the goblin at the door not this mage  matt no the goblin is gone literally hes still sitting on the couch  the door just opened and hes waiting for you all to enter  liam can we all see him from where we are  matt yeah  liam total poker face  matt yeah  laura humming  sam yeah lets go in  laura singing im already in the door  liam caleb takes the rear  
none	 matt okay so you got a marching order on this all right so you go out to retrieve them  you stayed on the couch  marisha did i yeah sure  taliesin i stood up and waved everybody in  matt so you guys are staying  travis jester nott fjord caleb  matt all right at this point yussa closes his eyes for a second whispers something welcome to  my chambers so now that weve gotten some conversation underway i would like to know who i  am speaking with you are all what who  marisha 
none	 the mighty nein  matt very well  taliesin oh  matt dont even attempt you are  travis im fjord  matt fjord  marisha beauregard  liam im caleb widogast  sam im nott  laura jester lavore  taliesin and im caduceus again its a pleasure  matt yasha just gives a nod yasha i am yussa errenis i am the owner of the open quay and i  have been a practitioner of the arcane arts in seclusion for over 200 years you carry with you  something that is very dangerous and i would very 
none	 much like to stay here because the longer its on  your persons the larger chance there is you misuse it and destroy yourselves or it falls in  the hands of someone who should not have it  laura we almost died in there  matt case in point  travis im assuming hes talking about the happy fun ball  matt yes  taliesin i would ask just so that it doesnt get me into trouble with my compatriots  that i convinced that honesty and forthrightness was the best policy  matt should you wish to come 
none	 and discuss or see it or we can compare notes  on our experiences you know where it is  taliesin i was hoping for perhaps a trade so that they felt that they got something back in  return it doesnt have to obviously be so dangerous if you have something that at least  they can feel like they can hold something in the meantime  matt this was something that did not belong to you to begin with that came into your possession  from a third party and you are just the current custodian of it 
none	 and nearly got yourself killed  i am doing you a favor i will study it i will keep it here where its safe if you have need of it  if you need to come look at it or wish to learn of its secrets do so in my presence  where it can be done safely  marisha how about a nonmonetary exchange  matt you  liam hmm  matt it looks like within your coat you are holding tomes are you a practitioner of the  arcane arts yourself  liam hmm  matt have you 
none	 the capabilities to transport your compatriots via circles of arcane nature  liam via circles of arc transportation you mean to jump from one city to another that sort of thing  matt yes  liam not as of yet  sam but he learns very fast  laura can you teach him  matt i may perhaps have something like that but at the very least i do keep such a circle  reserved for the select friends i keep  liam here in your home  matt yes so as part of our trust of me keeping this 
none	 sphere you would be granted the  capabilities once you are able to make this journey to return here with your friends you  would have an anchor here on the coast and you would be under my protection when you arrive  does that seem like a fair trade those who seek friends and allies  travis i have no objection  sam seems very fair yes  laura how long until you can do something like that caleb  sam probably any day he reads a lot of books  marisha do you have any type of scrolls 
none	 or spell books  laura or candy  marisha or candy that you could lend to calebs aid further advancing his ability to learn that  taliesin im by the way already putting the ball on the table and leaving it by the tea tray  as we have this discussion i have definitely moved it to the center of the room  matt okay he takes it and lifts it inspects it  taliesin we can let you know what we saw inside  matt he wraps it into his robe  laura it drops gold sometimes though  
none	 matt the robe you watch as he places it over the sphere and the shape beneath just dissipates  liam you have some knowledge of where that leads  matt of where this leads i do and the mage it once belonged to  liam you know him personally  matt no i do not know him personally but there are few in my circles that have not heard of his  exploits in the past  laura was he a good guy or a bad guy  matt at a certain level of arcane practitioning morality becomes a bit 
none	 ambiguous but to the  common man i would say probably not a very team player  taliesin did we ever get confirmation on the owners death or did we not  sam no we just assumed  laura yeah because his pet dragon hadnt seen him in a long time or something  matt and yes i do have access to various spells but ive earned them im willing to share  knowledge based on the development of our friendship and proven loyalty  sam how do we prove our loyalty  matt by not fucking me over  
none	 sam weve been here the whole afternoon we havent fucked you over once  laura we gave you a cool ball  matt you did and i made a trade of information and a safe haven when you find more information  like this and more items like this bring them back to me there may be times where perhaps i  could use some help in doing things that im not comfortable leaving my tower for maybe you could  be of aid in that case there will be opportunities im sure to earn more trust  liam caleb 
none	 extends his hand out slowly  matt sad one  liam thank you  matt but you have to earn  travis is there anything that we can do for you in the short term  sam anything to keep an eye out for  matt i would like very much to see this other thing that you have come across if this  is a powerful artifact i am very curious as to what other geometric shapes youve come across  taliesin that we i think we feel also would be something that we would be interested in doing 
none	  once we feel even more comfortable with this arrangement and once trust is built  liam once you have earned our trust  taliesin obviously you are so much more powerful than we are that it would  behoove us to be a little careful  laura yeah you could probably just kill us right now if you wanted to  taliesin i mean really he probably could  matt you are not incorrect  liam this one has sentimental value it is not to be left here  matt well might i at least possibly inquire as to 
none	 what it is capable of you may not know the  dangers you carry with you as you obviously did not understand of this sphere  liam we have a better understanding of this one  marisha as traveling mercenaries were used to being in danger  matt very well  laura it makes babies  marisha quietly it does  sam well they talked about yeah  taliesin i have a  matt you have a geometric shape that makes babies  laura yeah  taliesin would it be possible to get an assurance that we could leave this 
none	 place  with it and that no harm would come to us  travis well i think if he knew that it helps us on our exploits  taliesin it does  travis which thereby helps him i mean we are sharing arent we  taliesin im willing to take a certain person at their word  liam i take him at his word that he could kill us all if he wanted to if he wanted  to take it against our will he would i am comfortable with you examining it  but we dont wish to leave 
none	 it here we wish to bring it with us when we leave  taliesin no matter what also we would appreciate it if you would not speak of who owns  this artifact with anyone if you have to discuss the artifact thats one thing but we would  prefer us to be anonymous its a dangerous world and it would show great trust  matt i am generally uncomfortable in making deals regarding passing glances at  worldshattering artifacts if that be the case but you have blessed me with some fine tea this day  taliesin bring more 
none	 the next time i go home if theres a home to go to  matt you have my assurance and if it is indeed such a dangerous item and you wish to carry it  with you then woe be unto you so let me see it  laura really are we sure about this  taliesin its time to trust somebody  sam were all in  taliesin its the iron safe and then yeah  travis singing give us a helping hand  sam did you already look at it today  travis yeah  matt takes it 
none	 and begins to cast a spell that you recognize as an identify spell  casts another spell that you dont recognize sighs takes a moment and concentrates on it  and you watch his face go slack a familiar expression that many of you have seen  your friends as they concentrate on it do so  travis now  laughter  matt aww itll be so disappointing when they pass through the illusion  laura oh  matt you dont know you think a mage lets people into his living room unprotected  are you kidding me you dont 
none	 live as long as he has without some sort of backup  taliesin i got banishment on hold just in case  matt about a minute passes and then the muscles in his face tighten back into his neutral  expression this is i have studied much and this is new to me id be worried if this was  something dangerous that i knew and understood well i find it far more concerning that this is  something i know nothing of where was this found  marisha zadash after the spire attack  travis in the hands of 
none	 an assassin  marisha either it was in the trispire and they successfully exited with it  or the xhorhasian were trafficking it  laura i think the trispire stole it from the xhorhasians and they were trying to get it back  marisha thats what we believe  matt very interesting sighs whatever magic this is it blends elements of arcane and divine  but is outside of what i know can sense its very alien  marisha yussa do you know of the empire the clovis concord stealing artifacts from other shores  matt i mean if there 
none	 is any sort of dominion to hold you take what is available i mean  everything as far as vasselheim to emon to ankharel anyone in power has their threads and  eyes out for what could possibly help them maintain their positions in power and what dangers  there are out there that is beyond morality that is just simple intelligence to survive in a world  that is continuously beset by darker powers and things beyond our control if this was taken  from xhorhas then god knows what they were attempting to do with it  laura 
none	 make babies  matt make babies  laura well thats what the guy said  liam very bad people want this thing  matt then very bad people will be after you  sam well were also sometimes bad people so  matt that does not necessarily mean youre protected just be careful  laura do you have any ways to protect us right now were keeping it in this bag  do you have any better way to keep it secret  matt i think that is probably the best method you have remove it only when absolutely necessary 
none	  and for short periods of time that will protect from divination on this plane but only this plane  laura oh right okay  taliesin thats very good to know i hope that now that you understand how much we appreciate  your gesture of trust and how much  laura quietly thats my name  taliesin jester of trust and how much we are putting our faith that you are on  the side of good and right if  matt i did not say im on the side of good and right i am on the side 
none	 of maintaining  a balance in which society can exist  taliesin thatll do  marisha we havent showed  laura gasps have you ever heard of the traveler  matt no  laura i look in my bag and i get out a little figure that i made of him  matt i have no idea what this is  laura hes really big on balance too here ill leave it for you thats also a present okay  sam do you want to leave a pamphlet too so he can find out more information  laura yeah okay 
none	 there we go ill stick it under the there you go  matt hes glancing to you all like  sam she does this a lot  travis yeah she talks to him  matt thank you  laura hes really powerful  matt im sure  taliesin we would appreciate any information that you may glean about this ukotoa traveler  the blooming grove i am of the belief that these things are connected that these chaotic forces  are moving towards something unsettling and unbalancing  matt then i will do my best to do what i can 
none	 on my end of things well thats been my morning tea  sam thank you for your time  matt well we have one more business to attend follow me the rest of you and he waves his hand  across the table and on the side of the platter where the teacups were  this conjured plate of biscuits appears  laura yay  matt enjoy  travis and you die  matt he walks away gesturing for you to follow  laura thats my name  liam ill promptly follow  matt you head up the stairs doesnt 
none	 say a word to you it curls around and around for a good two  minutes no windows very little light the occasional similar sparkling globe emitting a low  torchlight until eventually you come to another door the staircase continues upward in a spiral  but theres a doorway to the right and a small landing it opens he enters and you enter with  him this chamber it is a small domed room maybe about 15 feet across and it is  circular on the base it domes to the top and there is no other exit  
none	 travis just him and caleb right  matt mmhmm you enter  liam ja  matt the door closes darkness all of a sudden you see a rune above you that emits a bright blue  light that lights the chamber everything is in shades of blue he gestures to the floor and as  you glance down you can see now where the blue light hits this large runic circle that  encompasses the entire chamber is now glowing in response you recognize it this is  a teleportation circle this is a receiving teleportation circle he looks to 
none	 you  liam one way  matt he says there are transports i have in other parts of this tower to different places  earning my trust perhaps you may gain more access but for now you have a place to return to  how much time do you need he gestures to the symbol to memorize it  liam oh dm question i dont know what level off the top of my head teleportation  matt i believe its 5thlevel  liam so how much time  matt this isnt the spell this is the receiving rune when you 
none	 learn the spell  you can use that spell to return here  liam right  matt do you have access to the spell  liam no oh sorry  matt you can either choose it at a higher level when you decide to go up  liam yes i do have it but it would take me a lot of hours  laura but you can memorize the rune  liam i mean he would look at it for a minute and have the rune in his head  matt then there you go when you finish he goes 
none	 a quick learner good to know where did you train  liam mostly on my own to be honest for years  matt impressive you have a talented eye for picking up arcanic sigils and glyphs  liam it was not my intention to bother you here my friends were very curious  matt that they are  liam it was fairly obvious to me that this building was real estate owned by someone of great skill  matt it is designed to keep people like you out but sometimes tenacity makes  for interesting breakfast conversations  liam i 
none	 actually thought it was a very bad idea to come here  matt it was but you came anyway and look where you are  liam sometimes follow my friends places i shouldnt  matt that might one day get you killed or may one day get you what you seek  liam well my apologies on my groups presumptuousness i hope that we have not  made a grave error here today and if we havent i hope to earn that trust as you say  matt ive lived quite a long while and the only reason ive lived 
none	 this long is i have made allies  i followed them into sometimes stupid unnecessary circumstances many of them died helping me many  of them i outlived but i wouldnt be where i am today if i didnt at least trust in the power of others  liam thats good advice  matt use who you need to but know everyone can be useful if you can mete out their skills  liam sighs im sure you have much to do today  matt im sure you do as well the door behind you opens up again  the 
dung	 light turns dark and the stairways behind you  liam feel for the wall  matt eventually you find your way to the staircase the faint light below guides you to the exit  liam that eventually spills out down here  matt yeah eventually leads you back down to the chamber you guys are down there waiting  taliesin i saved you a biscuit  sam these biscuits are real good  laura theres cinnamon in em  liam cinnamonamonamon  matt uniquely each biscuit tastes different it is specially designed for your personal interests  sam mine tastes 
none	 like fish  laughter  marisha oh bourbon  laura bourbon biscuit thats delicious  marisha it sounds really good  laura honestly a fish biscuit doesnt sound terrible  marisha its like a red lobster biscuit  taliesin a lobster biscuit that a thing  sam well thanks  laura lobster  taliesin lobster biscuit is a thing  marisha some places call them lobster rolls  liam come on we are quitting while were ahead lets go oh streusel  matt you guys exit the tower closes behind you  sam and marisha howd it go howd it

none	 nicodranas notes  taliesin roll for initiative  matt its about four and a half days to the wuyun gates for the sake of brevity because  weve done this once before the guards that are posted at the wuyun gates theres much  more of a force of security here as you approach there is a back up to the caravan  more than you previously experienced exiting each person coming through is having to  provide paperwork that says where youre going who youre going to see its customs  essentially its getting close to your passing through 
none	 what do you do  laura i should forge something really fast who do we know  marisha i forgot about this weve done this before  liam it took four days to get here weve done it before we would have known this  was going to happen not the amount of security but that there was security  sam didnt we have a way to get back in no  laura from somebody in zadash didnt we shit what was that guys name that  after we won the thing and then we were in his where you

none	 know his allegiances or his motives or anything neither did you none of us did  there are people who would flay me like a cat if they could get their hands on me so  marisha did he say something to you about your past when you were in there with him  liam no but he was hard to read  marisha you think he saw into you  liam sighs i dont know beauregard  marisha youre a man of  liam but i dont like to not know i like traveling with you people and i 
dung	 dont want to take  unnecessary risks so im not telling you what to do i could not tell you what to do but if  for me to stay with you all i cant keep poking my head up like a mole from a hole in the ground  because someone is going to cave my skull in if i do it in the wrong place and if you all are with  me you will die with me that man in rexxentrum he would spread my guts out onto the stone floor  if he could get his 
none	 hands on me now if he knew where i was so i factor that into all of my  thinking everywhere we go everywhere i have been for five years i have been looking over my  shoulder so its not really fair to all of you because we are linked like this now he is  arguably the most powerful man in the empire  marisha the man in rexxentrum or yussa  liam ikithon i just wanted you to understand me better as much as i am able to have friends  i like you all right i 
none	 dont people very well i am well aware its been a long time since i had  a lot of practice but i have to be careful and if we cant be careful enough i have to go  marisha do you have to go or do you want to go because what im hearing from you caleb  is that you dont understand that you have friends were here willing to defend you  and kick some ass just like we did for fjord  liam that is beside the point  marisha is it though  liam yes 
none	 it is very much beside the point because if i care for any of you at all and that  man in the northern end of this empire knows where any one of you are he knows he can get to me  if he finds us you all will just be thrown into the fire with me  marisha caleb unfortunately you dont get to choose who cares for you  its not a choice you get to make you can either accept this  liam were talking around each other that is not the point that i am 
none	 arguing i am saying that  if we are going to stay together we have to be careful careful  marisha what do you want we cant find anything out if we dont talk to people if were not  careful i dont like not knowing either caleb its why i thought i would talk to people  liam just persons like that one in that tower  marisha i thought youd be excited i thought i did a damn good job in there i thought  me and caduceus both did i was talking to nott and we thought 
none	 for damn sure that  you would be so stoked about this goddamn fucking tower  liam you know in the abstract i am but the problem with friends is that  you have to care about them and i wander away  marisha wow shouting wow fucking cool caleb  laura caleb is really cool  marisha yeah hes cool shouting youre cool caleb see jester thinks  youre fucking cool because shes your fucking friend  travis im trying to sleep what are yall doing  marisha even louder sorry fjord  travis aw fuck  taliesin what

town	 go ahead and make an investigation check  taliesin mmhmm 14  matt asking around no sign of gustav  taliesin thatll do  matt the few people that knew of him only because of the conversation and local talk about  old persons voice that terrible circus that came through town  that carnival that killed all them people  taliesin greatest show on earth  matt gustav fucked off as soon as he was let out  taliesin cool  sam were going to alfield or are we bypassing alfield  matt youre going to alfield and then 
none	 bypassing zadash is what you were saying  and then going straight to felderwin  travis veering right  matt you make your way two days to felderwin im sorry to alfield any business in alfield  sam are we checking in with bryce  marisha yeah do we  laura yeah sure just say whats up  matt okay as you approach the city the people here go about their business per normal though it  does look like there is a presence of righteous brand soldiers maybe a hundred or so that have  been stationed here on 
none	 top of the crownsguard the crownsguard were here before and you see  righteous brand patrolling the major ins and outs and doing passes around the vicinity general  protection to this city has been increased in the presence of this war you approach the city and  ask around bryce is both available though looking a bit harried they approach  my goodness its been some time friends you look traveled  marisha thanks  matt what can i do to help you  laura well mostly were just wondering if you have any information about whats been going 
none	 on  matt well best that we can best that i know at least were just being as careful as  possible we didnt expect things to press this far east this quickly from what i know is  felderwin just recently took an assault from the brief missives that have been sent around to  various lawmasters in the vicinity the attacks came from underground  travis underground  sam what  matt it wasnt a direct assault apparently and this put us in a bit of a tizzy recently  they managed to just appear in the city 
town	 from underneath  travis were they able to repel these attacks  matt they burned some of the fields and destroyed a few buildings and then left  i dont know the exact number of dead youd probably have to ask  laura are you worried its pretty close to here  matt im a bit worried yes were all a bit worried we dont want to alarm the populace but  sighs rumors spread and we do our best to quell them  laura whats your sewer system like here  matt its more of a we dont have 
none	 any of the fancy subterranean sewers as cities like zadash  to the north its mostly a digahole outhousetype scenario  sam that might actually be safer  matt good were just hoping that there isnt much of a reason to stop in alfield at least we  know that felderwin supplies most of the empire with its food and crops and such so there seems  to be some strategic reason for that assault though i dont see what purpose alfield has in the  larger spectrum so im banking on that  laura cool  matt where are 
none	 you off to  travis felderwin  matt well good news is theyve already been attacked hopefully the lightning doesnt strike twice  travis indeed  taliesin they stole whatever it was they were trying to steal i guess  marisha thats exactly what i think  taliesin hi by the way  matt hi yes we met briefly when you passed through here earlier  taliesin good to see you again  matt pleasure to see you again as well  travis we should be on our way  sam say hi to everyone for us  travis a 
none	 bit quicker than we thought im afraid  matt thats all right if theres anything that i can do to aid you if you need to pass through  again just let me know you know where to find me  travis good to see you  matt good to see you as well travel safe  taliesin actually would a letter of good note get us any further in case we run into anybody  sam maybe not from bryce i mean i like bryce  taliesin i dont know  sam bryce is cool  matt theres not 
none	 much i can really help with im not really involved in the red tape of most  things if its another lawmaster youre going to speak with thats one thing but  taliesin its worth asking i suppose  marisha you wouldnt happen to have any handwriting samples of some lawmasters  sam we have the handwriting samples  marisha i know but for more other ones other than you know  sam happen to have any forgeable paperwork of other cities lawmasters  travis do you have any deposited checks or bank statements  marisha stolen mail  matt

none	 river cresting the hills before it you can already see the low haze of gray and  brown thats gently fading over the region as you reach the peak and look down upon the familiar  sight of the oncegreen farmland that you had passed by when you were heading north toward  shadycreek run you can already see a fair patch of the tillage lies black and ashen probably a  quarter of it as you begin to make your way towards the outskirts of the city you can already  see small squadrons of righteous brand patrolling the 
town	 fields i mean a dozen small squadrons of  about 50 soldiers each  marisha whistles  matt you can see quite a few military has been relegated and probably sent southward from  bladegarden since this incursion a few weeks back as you come upon the outside of felderwin which  is built not too far from the eistus river you can already see there are a number of buildings  burned and blackened on the opposite end of the fields the fields are on the northern side of the  city on the southeastern side theres a section 
town	 of the town that appears to have burned or burnt  down to varying degrees depending on buildings  sam im going to put my hood up the mask on  matt okay anyone else  taliesin ill human up for a second  laura nott where are  sam yeah no yeah  laura where is your family where are they located im sure not the actual citycity right  sam you mean the clan  laura yeah  sam no they dont live in the city  laura what about you know  sam the fellow my friend 
none	  laura yeah the guy  sam yeah theyre in the city hes in the city somewhere yeah i know where the house is  ill lead them towards  matt okay lead them to the city you see that there are crownsguard a little more than usual  definitely on the perimeter of the city you can see bands of ten to 12 righteous brand set along  at fairly intense positions to look outward theyre doing their best to lock things down as  this investigation is still being completed as to what transpired here  sam im 
none	 going to start heavily drinking  matt you make your way to that part of the city glancing over towards the first main plaza  intersection of this part of felderwin theres a few people talking a blue flash catches  your attention out of the corner of your eye you see three righteous brand soldiers that are  standing with an elven woman in fine flowing clothes of green and black  she angrily gives a few offhanded orders at a distance while it looks like the  source of this blue flash a male figure is standing where 
none	 previously was not  marisha oh shit okay  matt this figure that apparates is wearing deep blue robes and appears to be elven with very long  white hair also an elder elf though of pale skin in comparison to the one you met previously  approaches with haste towards this woman they begin to whisper for a moment before he shoos off  the rest of the guards and the two of them begin to walk together the pair of them having a conversation  marisha caleb  sam i dont recognize either  matt make a perception 
none	 check  marisha you recognize those people  sam 19  matt you see them you dont recognize them  laura did you recognize them  travis you said they look like someone we met previously  matt meaning it was a male elder elven figure but  laura just like yussa  matt just like yussa but yussa was of gwardan descent this appears to be of northern elf which  most of that bloodline stems from malaismere and what split off into bysaes tyl  laura learn about that too okay  taliesin youve got a lot of 
none	 reading to do this weekend  marisha my notes look like a serial killers its bad  matt theyre talking amongst each other and then walk and disappear around a corner  laura did we hear anything they said  matt youre too far away  laura okay man i wish i could read lips  sam do you want me to go sneak up or anything  travis was the blue flash from him apparating  matt yes do you continue on  laura yeah  sam i guess are we curious about that  travis yes we are

tavern	  sam im a little on edge youre not dumb  matt you head down that eastern thoroughfare passing by a number of homes and businesses you  start coming upon the ones that were damaged you see one looks to be a warehouse that burned down  there is an inn called the glassy grass inn that youre familiar with nott  sam glassy grass  matt that has burned to the ground there is another building next to that there is  the brenatto apothecary that is also burned to the ground there are people rummaging  through 
none	 the rubble through some of their homes still looking and pulling out  elements of whatever they can gather of their former life  sam stop the cart  laura neighing  sam is anyone around  matt you can see there is a crownsguard a pair of crownsguard that are walking this way  sam ill cast disguise self and be some gnomish old lady im going to walk over  to the burneddown apothecary and start looking around  matt for anything in particular or just trying to make it look like youre looking around  sam im 
none	 looking for identifying signs of life or  matt make a perception check  sam 15  matt you glance around looking through the visible rubble moving a few things dont appear  to be any signs of life nor any signs of death immediately  sam can i look for buttons  matt make an investigation check now that youre poring through  sam aw shit 11  matt unfortunately in this scattering of rubble i mean you can still see the frame of  the building standing with an element of the roof thats still there but most 
none	 of it has fallen  inward this was a place of business that appeared to have a few rooms of homestead attached to the  back of it but all that has burned and fallen in the crownsguard walk by and stop one of them  a female looks over and goes hey you looking for help  sam no i was just looking to see i knew the man who worked here  matt its terrible isnt it  sam whats terrible what happened  matt we dont get this kind of thing this far west were not supposed 
none	 to i dont want to  fight those things  sam what things  matt the cricks the things that came in and did this  sam do you know what were you here do you know what happened to this place  matt yeza  sam yes  matt i dont know they havent found a body so thats something his boy luke was found safe  and is staying with whats her name looks over to the other guy the other person  the woman looks at him and goes at old ediths house  sam do i 
town	 know edith  matt you know of old edith yeah an older woman a few buildings down  sam hes okay  matt yeah lukes okay  sam did the party that came in to attack were they taking prisoners or were they killing  matt from what i heard they just burned and slashed just under a hundred crownsguard were  killed a few of my friends 14 civilians died in the fires it was the weirdest thing  i watched friends of mine begin to slow down anyway  sam were you there  matt yeah thankfully not 
none	 on the front line  sam how did they get away the cricks did they go underground  matt they went back where they came through the tunnels and collapsed them behind them  sam which tunnels where  matt there between the city and the tillage he points in the direction where those two were walking  sam all right thank you im sorry for your loss  matt did you know them  sam yes  matt im sorry for yours too the two continue walking  laura nott  sam hmm  laura do you want help 
none	 looking  sam yes if you could could you look around this wreckage a bit and see  if you find anything interesting  laura of course  taliesin im going to do a general look around to see if i can get a sign of life  coming from anywhere in the rubble  matt this would be more of an investigation since youre looking through rubble  as opposed to peering through  liam where are the nearest guards at this moment  matt the ones that you were just speaking to  liam they walked off  
none	 matt theyre walking off now  liam im going to hop out of the cart go over to nott and trip fall face flat into the dirt  wipe dirt on my face and into my beard stand up and pull my hood up  laura im going to help nott search through the rubble  liam yes im going to start searching through the rubble  marisha same  matt lets make an investigation check as a group one of you helms it  liam ill helm it  matt with their help you have advantage on the roll 
none	  liam holy shit lets roll this die ooh two 14s that is a 23  matt you find a bunch of shattered alchemists equipment glass vials metallic containers of  different kinds that all have charred elements to them you find in a back room elements of bedding  that are mostly burned away some childs toys wooden that have been charred and burned  to a crisp no signs of any bodies you do find the basement which you do know of  the basement door is locked  sam i will unlock it  matt go ahead 
none	 and make an attempt  sam not good 15  matt its not moving at all  sam jester open the door  laura okay  liam im casting mage armor  sam caleb open it  laura i try to slam into the door to open it  matt make a strength check  laura ten  matt its not budging  laura im sorry nott yasha  matt yashas going to get extremely angry and rage and attempt to make her way through  at advantage strength check  travis thats a 19  matt thud its not 
none	 budging that lock is holding tight far more than it should for its design  sam is it magical  laura maybe i can cast dispel magic is it magic is it trapped  sam it wasnt  laura im going to cast dispel magic  matt okay yeah thatll do it the arcane lock on it dissipates and the pressure that has been  placed on it well say the lock falls open do you open the basement  sam mmhmm  matt stepping down the stairs underneath its a small chamber no more than 15 by 15 feet 
none	 the  room is tossed not like you remember theres a pile of broken table shards in the far right  corner theres additional shattered glass all over the floor here theres an iron chest  roughly three feet long by a foot wide that sits in the far left corner a single chair holds the  center of the room thats what remains inside  taliesin lighting it up in here  sam does it look like there was a struggle in here or its been turned by someone looking for something  matt make an investigation check  
none	 liam or blood or injury  laura or maybe they came in through  sam 22 21  matt it looks like there was definitely a struggle in here looking at the walls it looks  like there are blade scrapes against bits of stone a lot of the furniture in here has been  destroyed as part of that from heavy impacts but the center chair seems perfect  taliesin huh you know what that makes me think of i mean that seems thats weird  marisha i mean did you want to finish that  taliesin i figured 
dung	 you would know because im guessing  marisha i have an idea i have my opinion im just curious–  taliesin well whats your opinion  marisha someone was interrogated  taliesin thats way better than mine never mind  marisha what was yours  taliesin i was thinking that maybe there was an invisible person tied to the chair  sam thats way worse yours is much better  laura i go up and can i touch and see if theres an invisible person in the chair  matt there is not an invisible person  taliesin i really 
none	 appreciate that i was a little spooked  liam thats the mighty nein special  marisha nott you clearly have some personal attachment to this  laura im going to sit in the chair and see what i see what does it look like from the chair  matt it looks like the room  liam shes will grahaming it  taliesin youre tearing me apart  matt based on your investigation check you gather that the chair was probably  placed here after this whatever transpired in this room  marisha what would someone want from here  sam 
none	 i dont know  travis is there another way out of here  sam chemicals there was chemicals here he kept chemicals  travis second set of stairs into the house  matt there is no other exit from this chamber  taliesin no hidden ones nothing  matt make an investigation check  travis yeah ill search with him  matt make your separate rolls here oh are you helping  taliesin yeah ill help  matt so you get advantage on this  sam theres a box you said  matt theres an iron chest  travis 21 
none	  matt as you guys are inspecting all this you and caduceus are giving a fair play on the walls  no doors no other exits its just that stairway from what you can find  taliesin that chest its probably trapped we should be very careful  sam im going to go over and open it or is it locked  matt it is locked  sam i will unlock it thats 29  matt that breaks the arcane lock on it in spite of the resistance the spell  you click and see a brief poof as the 
none	 arcane lock is dispelled and unlocked  sam i open it  matt you open it up make a constitution saving throw for me please  sam 19  matt a brief puff of what looks like a dull black gas small explosion in your face and you pull  out of the way and inhale a little bit its a weird dizzying sensation that comes over  your body for a second but you manage to shrug it off  sam ill take another drink of booze and look in there  matt you see inside a retractable silver 
none	 tripod of some kind the apex looks like its set to hold  something its three of them that come together and you imagine where itd open up theres  a little platform beneath it they all dont meet really at the top theres three things  that are set to hold a device of some kind  sam hold something  laura like maybe this old dodecahedron down here  sam maybe does it look like the same metal of the dodecahedron any similar characteristics  matt it doesnt look like it has similar characteristics or metal per se 
none	  but you can try and fit it in if you want to  taliesin later somewhere else  sam try it  taliesin somewhere else  laura not here  liam lets get out of here lets take it to have you ever seen this before  sam no no ive never seen this before  taliesin anything else in the chest  matt yes there are three empty vials one full one that seems to contain it seems like its on  the verge of liquid and gas there is liquid in there but a lot of it 
none	 seems to be this heavy  foglike condensation a dull gray color  sam ill grab it and throw it to caleb  matt there appears to be a conglomeration of notes that were destroyed burned  most of it looks like shreds that are piled up in case someone were to attempt to try  and do something with it later there are two pieces of paper that appear to be still legible  cheering  travis and a picture and a picture  sam as we continue to invoke the beacon with extremely focused energy of different spectrums 
town	  and sources the effects unleashed are curious and reach far beyond this laboratory the dunamis field  is that right have we heard that before  marisha yeah  sam  sightlessly encompassed an entire portion of the town with locals complaining of an ill  sluggish sensation thats the slow being dragged down others at different experiments  rumored of witnessing people and livestock moving at a noticeably faster or slower rate  within entire sections of the city in proximity to the laboratory  marisha that guy mentioned people feeling slow  sam based on our previous 
none	 experiments and extracted techniques from captured kryn operatives  laura wait rumors we squashed by spreading a batch of molded fruit crop  sam yeah kryn operatives  laura kryn thats what they actually are  sam based on our previous experiments extracted from captured kryn operatives the abilities of  dunamis and dunamancy within xhorhas appears to focus around the manipulation of gravity  marisha time yeah gravity and time  sam entropy and time yet while the basis of what dunamancy origin glyphs we were able to  acquire show it to exist outside of the established schools 
none	 of magic what you got  liam may i  sam yes  laura gasps blah blah blah extremely difficult to work with attempts to isolate  a substance capable containing and sustaining the dunamantic energies within a casing has  proven both timeconsuming and costly you have some of the same stuff wait look  sam this magic by my theory is deeply rooted in ancient history of some arcana we take for  granted if these beacons are just the surface what eonsold rituals have been lurking beneath  the citadel in ghor dranas ghor dranas  laura 
none	 i dont know in these past weeks we have successfully distilled a single vial  that should enable a temporary influx of dunamis to even an untrained soldier  once i can remove the beacon itself from the process i hope to have this alchemist produce  a number of batches over the next 12 to 16 months refining the method with each step  until we can certify its use in combat is that your friend the alchemist  sam they were using the alchemist they were using yeza  laura listen listen word has found me of trent 
none	 finding a few of his proteges have a knack  for early dunamancy blah blah something something i am eager to look over their findings  and perchance fold these skills into my own imagine something something could be  accomplished by the assembly should we further learn to command these theres so many  things i cant read because its burned away existence the dreams are already thrilling  sam im beginning to believe it goes deeper between the fragments of power weve only begun to  unlock within these beacons and the capabilities of the kryn on the 
none	 battlefield i surmise they  have been learning to bend and break the threads of destiny for hundreds of years be this truth  i cannot imagine the raven queen looks down upon them favorably either though the thought brings  a laugh to my lips do i recognize any of this handwriting no  matt you do not  sam does he  matt you do not recognize any handwriting  laura you dont theyre going to be so pissed when they find out we have that thing  marisha we have a beacon yeah we have a piece 
none	 of dunamis  sam we have a vial  travis we have a tripod  marisha i think jesters right i think this dodecahedron goes into that tripod  travis hundred percent  marisha i dont think we should do it here because like yussa said we pull this thing out selectively  liam how does your friend fit into all of this  sam i dont know hes an excellent alchemist they would probably need someone like that  but the xhorhasians werent doing this someone else was right your people  marisha your people  sam your people 
none	 were doing experiments and trying to find out and harness the power of  what its your people its the people that you know and trained with  marisha its because they havent he hasnt in terms of  sam well fuck him  marisha oh wow yeah  sam its your people that have done this to my people and we have to find them both  travis we sent a message once is it worth trying it again  sam not right now i have to go see lady edith right now  taliesin is there any way

none	 put through that seems to be  most of anything of interest everything else has either been removed or is just  broken furniture and whatever this laboratory once was  travis put everything back in the chest and bring it with us put the chest in the haversack  matt the chest is a little big for a haversack  laura we can put the foldable tripod  matt its a threefoot by onefoot  taliesin can we relock the chest  liam the haversack is limited right  matt actually threefoot by you might be able to fit 
none	 it in longways into the  bag of holding the haversacks pouches arent large enough  matt you do have a bag of holding from  liam that fjord is in possession of  laura we have a bag of holding  matt you found it under the bed of  liam who has it i will gladly carry it  matt my brains not working the iron shepherds with lorenzo  laura oh thats right  taliesin i think we should try and lock everything up and maybe break the chair  laura why should we break the chair 
none	  marisha can i actually do a little pass on the chair and see if i see any signs  that someones been tied to it someones been questioned  travis how was it locked from the outside  marisha things that beau would know that people would do in her realm  matt make an investigation check  marisha aww jesus fucking christ 13  matt its a chair that was probably placed here after this attack  marisha we already knew that  matt i mean ill say based on the chairs placement the chest and the fact 
none	 that it was  locked when you left people had to have come back in and back out since this attack happened  probably whoever locked this chest put this chair here and then locked the room as they left  laura we need to get out of here  taliesin right now  marisha yeah i agree  laura lets go quickly  marisha fjord  taliesin i want to try and theres no way to actually im going to try and lock the chest  again when we leave im going to use not magically obviously but thaumaturgy 
none	  to close it and lock it or will that not work with thaumaturgy  matt ill allow it its simple enough for you to do with your hand if you want to  its not arcane locked but its locked  travis you didnt see anything when you sat in the chair right  laura no i just saw the room  taliesin lets have this conversation elsewhere this place is creeping me out  laura was there anything under the chair on the underside of the chair  matt appears to be a chair  sam huh no

none	 mean a magic chair i mean the setup in the room the mess around it  matt correct no you gather that whoever came down here last brought the chair with them to  probably lock their things and leave it here and then lock the basement behind them  not expecting anyone to make their way in in the interim  taliesin we need to go now  laura go go do we need to clean up calebs puke will somebody be able to find us with his puke  matt caduceus has been cleaning it  taliesin i
