the mighty nein had found their way outside of the dwendalian  empire and to the first city along the coast of the menagerie coast nicodranas where fjord had  passed through previously on his various adventures through the waters nearby and jesters  upbringing was entirely within you had met with jesters mother marion the ruby of the sea as  well as began to seek information about an individual that /tavern/ was connected with your time up at  shadycreek run and the sphere that you had absorbed fjord in this period of time you  discovered there was an individual that had grown jealous and strangely aggressive regarding the  companionship of jesters mother and as such you began to seek information about them in a way to  put an end to this behavior in doing so you went to a tavern and met a captain who had possibly  room for a few of you to travel with about a week from now you met a tortle for /none/ many of you the  first time youve encountered a tortle who had some interesting things to say and a lead on the  individual you were looking for you also found information about whats called the sluice weave  a series of waterways beneath the city where this algar this individual that was creating tension  with the ruby of the sea works and oversees you made your way to the outskirts of the docks  searched through the water for an entrance managed to muscle your way through the grates  below nearly drowning the pets you had /none/ recently purchased you encountered a few small water  elementals and eventually came upon one of the nexus areas of this waterway where there was an  elemental entity named zsundie that was bound to this location and was helping run and control the  water in and out under the supervision of algar catching them but however not being as stealthy  as you had hoped you were noticed and as such a battle commenced where zsundie this elemental  figure was given the command by algar to take care of you and see you out in this fray /none/ a  number of you fell and fell again but through a combination of fjords teleportation spell  abilities you guys keeping each other alive you repeatedly punching very hard whatever got in your  way you managed to subdue algar destroy his two guards raised one as a specter and noticing that  there was something affixed to his wrist that seemed to have some connection with zsundie fjord  cut his left hand off and thats where we pick up the rest of you are slowly pulling your way  your bodies are completely waterlogged from rushing through /none/ thighhigh waters and many of you  being submerged nearly drowned at times you gather yourself as you realize the threat is gone  the water elementals destroyed and this entity that was once attacking you seems to have lowered  their trident and turned around their attention elsewhere releasing any aggressive demeanor they  have held since your arrival at this time you beau as you turn the corner and mashed the face  of algar against the wet stone wall you look over to see both fjord slice the hand off of his right wrist  marisha wait /dung/ right or left  matt oh sorry left hand its to your right you see the left hand get cut off he screams out  bleeding from the stump as he grabs it with his other hand the hand and the bracelet that was  attached both clattering to the ground with a wet thud and it spinning falling over to the side  beau you also look over and notice there is this horrible strange undead entity floating  immediately to your right of you and algar this spectral creature that is ethereal but made of  dark blue /none/ and black energy this drowned spirit that is giving off this horrible guttural sucking  sound and fjord still stands there blade in hand looming over the two of you technically  liam theyre hidden from all the rest of our views right  matt yeah you guys know where they went but you have no idea whats transpired since currently  zsundie is floating towards the back of the chamber towards where they are what do you do  marisha fjord is he with you im pointing at the spectral guy  travis he is  marisha so i /none/ shouldnt kill him  travis i dont think so might be unwise  marisha you all right man  travis yeah i want that bracelet ill reach down and pick it up  matt okay you pick the bracelet and algars like groaning pained panting  travis ill hold it in front of his face you used this to control that  matt make an intimidation check with advantage  marisha yeah im still holding him down  travis thats a 25  matt yeah it was part of my post what are you going to do please dont kill /none/ me please  travis well it depends on how forthcoming you are anything i need to know to operate this thing  or i just slap it on and start giving commands  matt at this point zsundie appears at the back of the chamber rounding the corner the large  thick barrelchested fishlike form wearing this very welltailored vest with the silks of the  shirt billowing around its wet elemental form its fish face curled into this sly grin it spins  around and looks towards algar and you guys it says with this low burbling fish voice /none/ ah i  see the hour is nigh for vengeance it pulls the collar from its neck and it clangs onto the ground  uncertain noises  sam ask him to put it back on  liam im going to start covering distance  travis indeed the hour is nigh  matt it puts out its hand you have seemingly come to the aid of this humble individual please  hand me the implements of my enslavement  travis may i ask how you came to be enslaved in this predicament in the first place  matt that is not /none/ of your concern  travis how about an answer for the bracelet  matt algars still moaning dont trust him  marisha i punch him  travis thats right you do  marisha shut up  matt the rest of you are closing up on this space  taliesin were making our way there  matt you guys leap up and begin to climb in the meantime the creature looks to you and says  lets just say that there were powerful minds that were interested in the benefits of my  undivided attention towards things that were of not /none/ my interest  travis im sorry to hear that i never like to see a creature put under the boot of somebody else  for their gain ill toss him the bracelet  matt catches it picks up the necklace and both of them get tucked inside of its vest with this  heavy wet sucking sound looks over to algar it would appear that you have this taken care of but  would you do me the honors  marisha well  travis actually if you wouldnt mind we have further need  marisha questions yeah just a conversation /none/ maybe first can you wait five minutes  travis not even five minutes perhaps if he can tell us the safe way out of here in exchange for  letting us have our way with algar he could be on his way and we can have our time  marisha im confused on the levels on what youre talking about what all you want but im with it  wait do we do need from algar  travis but i dont want to kill algar  marisha you do want to kill algar  travis i do not nope  /none/ marisha you dont want to kill algar yeah okay  travis hand up one sec yeah im saying dont kill algar  marisha yeah ill give earmuffs to algar still have my knee in his face  matt hes bleeding out  travis i want to know if theres other booby traps  liam were all watching  matt yeah you guys all now have gone into the chamber you can see this  liam im going to attempt to do that thing ive seen beauregard do so many times and foof up my  biceps and look intimidating  /none/ marisha what do we do with algar  travis im not sure yet  marisha by the way i think algars unconscious he might be dead  travis algar  marisha yeah  travis ill give him a little cheek slap  matt hes definitely passed out hes not dead but there is a large amount of blood coming out of  his severed stump  laura i stand next to caleb and poke his biceps ooh  sam guys need any help  marisha should we  travis ill tear off a sheet of ribbon off of my sleeve /dung/ and ill wrap it around his forearm like a  tight tourniquet  matt make a medicine check  laura do you want me to stabilize him i can do that  travis 11  matt thats enough to stabilize okay youve prevented him from bleeding out he looks pale and  has lost a lot of blood and there is this dark pool thats still suffusing the space around him  on the stone floor on the raised area of the hallway so hes stable zsundie as the rest of  you came around the corner you can see /none/ him standing there looking at the group well i have  things to take care of now it looks to you ketiv zsundie is my title ive been held here  for too long should you find yourself among the endless seas of my world come to my silversilt palace  travis silversilt  matt there i shall reward you for your assistance now ill go to free my partner  marisha hey zsundie real quick just seems like you were powering the entire city how would we do  that without you  matt thats a good question and /none/ it leaves  laura what was the palace what did he say  all silversilt  laura where was the palace is it in the ocean  travis im pretty sure  laura was it in the ocean  sam its probably not on land yeah  taliesin is everybody okay by the way do we have every oh god im going to cast turn undead  travis oh  matt okay  marisha to the guy  liam yeah  matt that is a 14 whats your dc  taliesin dc on turn undead let me find it again /none/  matt whats your spell dc  taliesin spell dc is 16  matt the specter goes groaning and immediately turns around and starts drifting down the hallway  away from you giving this horrible hollow sucking scream  travis thank you  marisha did we need him was he useful too  travis nope no i just forgot he was there  taliesin all right lets  sam good job mr clay  talisin if everyones got a minute does anybody need healing  travis actually algar might need a quick  laura i have a question  taliesin /none/ im going to start a ten minute  laura are we going to kill him  travis no  laura well if we dont how do we get away without anyone knowing that we killed his guards  and we let the guy go  marisha yeah  sam what do you mean just tell him dont tell anyone or well come back and kill you  travis yeah  laura what if he goes in to like a protection service or something  sam we need to have a conversation with him afterwards we can tell him to leave /none/ the city and  never come back or well take off your other hand  travis i like that plus theyre guards its their duty to fight which they did and we  defended ourselves  laura thats true  travis i feel like  laura i mean we werent even going to attack if he hadnt attacked us in the first place  liam although to play devils advocate you are right he could change his mind down the line and  try to get revenge on you or your mother  laura i dont want him to get /none/ revenge on my mother  travis well make it pretty quick  marisha we can do other things to make sure  laura can we make it seem like algar was the one who did all this  travis yep  laura like maybe he turned  sam did he see you does he know who you are  laura no  sam then why would connect anything to his mother unless we tell him to your mother i mean  laura well because i heard tracy say that she was staying at the fancy the lavish chateau  sam /none/ its a hotel that lots of tracys i think probably stay at  travis if we want to be really careful there are other places to stay  liam im also curious to know what he is doing down here in the first place  sam why dont you step aside so that he doesnt see your face when he wakes up or disguise your  face so he hasnt  laura oh good call  liam i would like to throw my hat in the ring to say that i think he might need to die here ja  /none/ sam okay so we got two kills four maybes  laura what if we send him out to sea dont necessarily kill him but make him leave and then  make it seem like he was the one that did everything  travis i think were going to listen to your influence on this one jester it is closest to you  marisha we do have one passage secured with captain adella we could just tell edér whats  his name algar thats pillars of eternity we could just tell algar you have a new plot in  life now /none/ and its going to be to help captain adella  sam wait is yasha going with adella no  travis no  sam shes on a different boat maybe  matt yashas with you  sam no i know but shes going to be leaving at some point soon right  matt she was making her way towards the sea but hasnt made passage anywhere  travis no hard plans well lets wake up this son of a bitch  sam we can always kill him  travis yeah well get answers  laura worst case scenario we kill him /none/  sam maybe best case scenario yes  liam just put a pin in it and see what we find out here  marisha do you want to disguise yourself before we do this  laura oh okay yes i will disguise myself as a tortle but not the that guy we met like a tortle  thats a girl  matt okay  liam period  travis yeah thats it  matt i like that a gortle  sam so exactly the same as the guy except long hair  laura no no hair but like a skirt  /none/ matt there you go tortle skirts  laura because girls wear skirts obviously thats what girls do  matt jester needs to get out more  liam tortles wear skorts  taliesin at some point theres going to be a healing spell  marisha i get back on top of algar and im restraining him pinning him down  taliesin does anybody not need healing  liam well herr clay do you need healing  sam i dont  marisha i could use some healing  liam yeah what about yourself  taliesin oh im getting in on this  /none/ liam i could use some i dont know if you are sharing  laura you could do a prayer of healing  taliesin that was what ive been doing a prayer of healing  laura oh really we could both do prayers of healing  taliesin all right so im doing everybody except nott and im adding algar to this  matt okay  laura im going to say im doing it

actually thank you how many points  taliesin 14  sam thanks mr clay and jester  laura youre welcome  matt as the wave of healing divine energy emanates from clays focused point algar whos  still being held against the wall by beau gasping  travis ill bring the tip of the falchion right under his chin you know before we begin we got  this thing about calling out yelling really sensitive eardrums so lets not do that  marisha also before we begin i want /none/ to make sure that you know how serious we are in getting  honesty from you i take his head and i go whackwhack into the wall  travis back

succeeds  marisha fucking fuck  matt you can try it again if you have another ki point  marisha i do  matt /dung/ oh wait no let me see i think he might be immune to it for the next 24 hours based on the ability  marisha what to mine  matt if he succeeds on it yeah i think so  marisha well then i go i dont think you heard me whackwhack and ill try one more time  matt well im going to double check

back to it  liam lets just sit here until its crash pandas tomorrow  travis ill lean over to nott and say nott do me a favor and make sure hes not carrying  anything fancy in his pockets  sam im going to rifle through all of his pockets with lightning speed agility of hand  matt make an investigation check please  sam mm not good 12  matt 12 okay rifling through his bits you find 21 gold pieces 45 silver pieces two platinum /none/ pieces  sam great  matt you find one empty glass vial where a healing potion was used previously a dagger and  a basic hand crossbow with five bolts  sam all right ill take the gold and the bolts and everything else ill throw in a puddle  matt perfect  laura does he have any pretty buttons  sam does he have any pretty buttons matthew  matt he does attached to the shirt if you want to pluck them  sam i will pluck the buttons  matt there are six buttons  sam do i /none/ have to roll for each one  matt no youre fine to extort truth no you can continue to try it if you want to  marisha i try it again  liam spam it  marisha whack whack  matt all right with every more button pulled smack button smack button youre teaming up  on this regard  marisha real serious  matt okay thats a failure thats a natural ten okay you slam his head two more times and  pinch an area underneath the bottom of the jaw it causes his irises to swell for a /none/ little bit he  looks towards you head lolling a little bit  marisha now youre going to answer all these nice mans questions okay  matt he doesnt answer but you have his attention  travis what was your job down here and why were you giving commands to that creature with this bracelet  matt its my job i was assigned as the supervisor of the sluice gate  travis who do you report to  matt i report to the clovis concord i was assigned here maybe a few months back from port  zoon but i /none/ largely specifically report to the marquis and his associates  travis marquis  marisha the marquis the  matt marquis ze fuldan  marisha oh that guy right lives in the palace guy  travis yeah not lepual  matt no  travis demesne  liam fjord ask him if knowledge of that water creature that was here and is gone now if that is  known all the way to the top or is it his bag or  travis the creature that was here and the magic used to control him is that something that you  brought /none/ to the table or was that a device given to you and known in the higher ranks of government  matt hes resisting answering  marisha i dig that finger into his pressure point a little harder  matt make an intimidation check with advantage because you have him affected with the extort  marisha oh right charisma 11  matt in his current position he grunting the margrave and the concord are  aware this is one of two cities that runs with one of these marid underneath grunts  travis one of two cities  matt yes  /none/ travis and the other would be  matt port damali  travis right what else do you do here in nicodranas what do you do to pass the time  algar im trying to decide whether or not to hand you over to this fearsome beast over here and i  point to laughing caleb  matt with the muscles popping  liam ja and i send frumpkin whos holding his breath schlooping up on top of his chest hes  hungry and so am i  laughter  marisha it puts the lotion on its skin  travis ill /none/ make you into a jacket  matt i drink and carouse buy fine linens and furniture  laura thats good hobbies  matt yeah you asked what he does with his spare time  travis you have any significant others in the city  matt none really i take companions the ruby is a very beautiful creature  laura woo ruby shes real hot  laughter  travis agreed i think we all know the ruby of the sea far and wide think shed miss you if you  went missing  matt a few more weeks of wooing her /none/ yes  marisha no thats not how that shit works man  travis yeah  marisha laughs  matt theres a conflict inside where his masculine pride immediately hits with the hit to  his ego that you just delivered  taliesin what were you doing down here  matt my job  taliesin what is your job exactly  matt to maintain the weave to help exert my will on the creature that you just freed so it  can direct water towards the various furnaces that run a lot of the engines that help maintain some  of /none/ the commerce here in the city  liam ja and what happens to the commerce in the city now that you have fucked that up  matt oh i fucked it up well thanks to your interference here theyre probably going to have  to renetwork everything through analog means thatll take weeks itll be expensive  laura oh man youre going to be in so much trouble  taliesin especially i imagine if they start looking into everything you did with that kind of  power i mean having access to that kind of creature i cant imagine that /none/ you were on the  upandup about everything you did  travis especially if you start to admit that you did it all yourself ill use mask of many faces  to look just like him  taliesin people have got to have to start asking questions serious questions  matt you hear his head hit the stone once more who the fuck are you  travis as algar who the fuck are you  matt make an intimidation check with advantage  marisha so badass  travis 19  matt he looks down at his severed hand the stump /none/ having now healed over from the healing power of  your prayer look please i dont want to die i dont want to die down here i dont want to wash  up in the middle of the shore  travis you know what im feeling like beau that i just need to get out of this city and never come  back go somewhere far away i hold up also a stump because my hand is missing i need to go  in a boat and just go  marisha man that sounds like a fine idea algar doesnt /none/ it  liam frumpkin starts to lovingly gnaw with his beak on the upper chin of algar  matt that sounds like a great idea  travis maybe a haircut maybe a new name too what do you think  marisha oh man you look like a jorge  taliesin im going to pick up the severed hand and start casting decompose on it too  sam im going to start backing up shaking my head you people are fucked up  matt he nods right yeah ill go ill leave immediately just please let me go  travis all /none/ depends on how we decide to act as we get out of here im sure you know a very safe way  to the surface yes  matt same way i come in every day yeah ill show you out  travis shall we  laura what do we do with him so nobody sees him  sam must have a bag or something  travis just walk out with handless bagged man  laura hey yasha whats in your bag youve been carrying  matt its not on her its up in the boat you guys had put in /none/ the water she goes mostly just  blankets and gold  liam i have a cloak  sam yeah we can wrap him up in a cloak and carry him out like were carrying some equipment  laura okay i mean southern accent oh all right whispering shit i forgot to do the  voice how do you remember to do that all the time  sam he doesnt sometimes  marisha algar youre going to be very helpful when it comes to making sure algar knows who to  talk to and the right things to say to get /none/ us out right  matt right  marisha oh im sorry jorge  matt jorge hes still trying to pull away from the horrible slow sucking of  liam no its a beak  matt oh the tentacles wrapping around the neck and theres a slight biting right there  laura im going to pull out my disguise kit and give him a nice little beard and a mustache and  an eye patch  matt he sits there held to the wall being chewed on by a tiny octopus for the next 30  minutes while you roll okay /none/ roll for your disguise kit  laura im proficient with disguise so i roll with advantage because im  matt not with advantage but you get proficiency bonus so roll a d20 add your dexterity modifier  laura plus proficiency 20  matt algar looks like a weirder uncle of algar who could probably pass for a jorge sure yeah  but he looks different and is missing a hand so its definitely not algar  travis jorge any traps contraptions we should be aware of as were heading out  matt no no traps there are some lockdown failsafes /none/ but its not much help at the moment  travis how far away is the other container for the other i assume creature under the same  restraints we saw here he mentioned going to free his compatriot  laura his partner in port damali fjord  travis oh i thought there were two under nicodranas  laura i bet its his partner in port damali  matt he gives you a look that doesnt nod but you can see from his recognition that you hit the  nail on the head  laura see the accent it makes me /none/ smarter  travis i was okay with the rolling blackouts in nicodranas but two cities i feel a little worse  about a little worse theyll figure it out  marisha the whole eastern seaboard is shut down  travis theres a mage tower that goes up and down this place will be fine  taliesin theyre overinvesting in geniebased power systems  marisha technology yeah  travis well jorge why dont you show us the way out  matt he looks to beau to be let up because hes still being pressed  marisha oh i know its so /none/ obnoxious when someone has their hands on you and you dont want  it isnt it okay lets go  laughter  matt he gets up grunts still looking over the missing hand and back at the rest of you and  begins to slump his way further down the hallway where they were heading to exit youre following  him down this path hes using a small torch that he lit for light to make his way down here and as  he leads you through it opens up into a few other small chambers that have some tables /none/ and chairs  theres a number of weapons closequarter smaller weapons for any combat that may take place in a  tunnel theres a small sketch with charcoal or some sort of a darker chalk on the wall that  outlines the layout of the sluice weave for those that are coming in to see where theyre trying to  go and get to  liam i take a good long look at it  laura i draw a dick on it  liam great now i have to remember that as well  matt yeah yeah you do its /none/ part of it now  travis predick or postdick  liam its in is it in  matt there you go eventually he leads you to a spiral staircase that goes upwards there are two  sets of iron barred doors he has the keys to he opens them leads you in you do notice on the way  through there are a couple of archways leading from chamber to chamber where there are gated  portcullis doorways that would collapse down there are switches on the opposite side as a means  of defense if things were to go /none/ wrong to back up once you have them under your control he has no  means of doing so and you watch him very carefully heading up the spiral staircase it

meaning there is a plan in place that if ever the city were under attack from the sea that it was  one of their secret weapons to defend the city from ships thats the most you can find those  are all surface things that you see on the desk the rest of it doesnt seem to make much sense or  pertain to anything important to you  laura jorge sorry  /none/ taliesin go ahead no  laura are any of these

oneword and  very no  travis shouldnt have been a dick  sam well all right im sure its probably a sincerely  liam its very sad so sad that he had to sit down and write a letter about how he had to leave  the city and how he had to free the creature beneath the city because it was so wrong  laura dont /none/ tell him all those things i totally plan on doing that shit get out of here before  talking about  liam hes leaving  laura teeth clenched get out  marisha okay well go well meet up with you guys  laura yeah well see you back at the mumble  sam sure tortle  matt you escort him to the

little under a week you can secure passage today on a small ship thats  heading back to marquet you send him off on his way you wait another hour or so to make sure the  ship disembarks and he doesnt abscond from the ship itself you watch as it begins to make its  way towards the horizon and /none/ you feel confident that hes not going to be coming back anytime soon  travis that ring of keys that he gave us approximately how many keys are on that thing  matt eight  laura i need to write a letter about okay what should i say i hate this city i want everyone  to suffer what i feel in my heart  liam im sick of you people pushing me around  laura im sick of all you people pushing me around im freeing this djinn and im setting  sail for another land how about all /none/ of that  travis yes and i plan to betray all of the citys secrets to your foes if i ever return  itll be very smart to kill me on sight  laughter  laura thats probably good  liam its maybe its gilding the lily perhaps  laura okay well what if i just write ha ha ha im so glad you guys are going to suffer i got  away scot free  liam lots of middle fingers youll never catch me alive your city is shit  sam im going to burn all of my fellow /none/ guards with a large fireball first  laughter  liam we can take care of the guards  sam theyre going find some charred bodies and stuff  laura if the djinn got away then maybe the djinn did it  liam a water creature  sam howd that fire happen though  matt heres a question did you dismiss your specter or do you have a  travis i didnt dismiss it  matt as you guys are  marisha its just running around in terror  matt as youre leaving the area right behind you is this ghostly /none/ groaning what do you do with it  travis you mean as we go outside outside  matt yeah its following you  travis go back inside the room  matt you guys begin to watch as that same drowned specter is now coming back behind you groaning  taliesin oh god i turn undead  matt it turns right around and runs off a bit  sam wait turn undead really just turns an undead around  taliesin yes its turn undead  matt its frightened of him and runs away  liam its like a remote control car /none/ that spins  laura unless youre high enough level and then it pop  taliesin im not quite at the popit its too strong for me to pop right  matt correct it doesnt last a long while a short time passes and it just  laura so im writing this letter and im leaving it in his office yeah  liam yeah were still in the office are we not  marisha technically we left you three are here  liam while jester is writing i would like to flip this office for anything of value  matt you /none/ already have  liam oh just the papers  matt well you checked around for anything that would be interesting so  liam excellent  taliesin well i have a thought  laura what  taliesin what if he accidentally lost control of the creature and then ran  matt groaning noises  taliesin ah turn undead  laughter  matt how many channel divinities can you do  taliesin i might be out i was about to say dont i have i might be out  matt i feel like you were out last time well say you took /none/ a short rest but its wandered  back in the chamber and its looking at fjord groaning  taliesin oh yeah no im out  laura do we have two channel divinities or just one at this level then i turn undead  taliesin thank you  matt turns around and starts walking away  marisha i really feel like you could do something about this  taliesin maybe he ran away because doesnt want to be held accountable for his actions  laura oh thats true what do you guys think okay deuce has a really good idea maybe /none/ instead  of we say go fuck yourself and all of that what if we say its really strong we have this  version of his letter right here  liam draft number two  laura draft number two oh no i lost control of the genie and now i am so scared im running away  taliesin he strikes me as the sort of person who doesnt want to be held responsible  liam if you were fleeing in terror would you stop to write a letter  taliesin that might be his attempt to say i did this /none/ im sorry bye kind of thing  travis remember we dont want anybody to like him when he comes back  taliesin well theyre not there are people dead down there  matt ghostly groaning the specter returns as you guys are having this conversation  laura ah i cant do anything i try to attack it  matt all right go ahead and make an attack roll  laura ill sacred flame him  matt okay  marisha do you guys remember in tomb raider 2 the butler that you had  matt thats 12 so it takes damage /none/ thats basically what this is  laura oh thats 11 11 radiant damage  matt 11 points of radiant damage all right impact groaning  taliesin oh god sacred flame  matt success  taliesin three points  matt its not attacking anyone  laura oh its not  matt its not assaulting you guys its just standing there and taking the hits and looking in  pain it keeps looking for fjord ghostly groaning  travis you can go  matt it disperses into shadow and vanishes  marisha were time jumping  sam me and marisha are took /none/ jorge to the docks with the promise that fjord would come later and  join us  liam but he was the one that had all the sailor tricks to get the boat  matt this was me realizing that this is what would have happened earlier so were taking care  of it now okay because this would have been following i forgot about the specter briefly  earlier and this would have happened  taliesin i like that just takes responsibility for everything that happened down there  laura i like it better when hes saying fuck yourself /none/  taliesin oh thats fair too  matt i appreciate that theyve completely glossed over this scenario  taliesin thats very fair yeah  laura i think we should stick with the gofuckyourself version and say i  intentionally he intentionally let him go and he knew that he was going to fuck over the city  and run  liam i agree with you jester i think we should stick with go fuck yourself  laura okay sincerely  sam i mean i dont know if im really here right now so  matt well say that you guys /none/ are all together  sam okay that sounds good  travis christ its a letter just fucking write it and send it  laura im leaving it in the office fjord  travis okay  liam maybe something like choke upon your woe  laura choke upon your woe  liam or eat fecal matters  laura or eat fecal matter question mark signed algar  laughter  matt go ahead and roll for your forgery kit  laura with proficiency  matt with proficiency so d20 plus ill say this is for intelligence  sam do you want to /none/ look at the dodecahedron first  laura oh yeah i do i do  sam before you write this letter lets time jump again before you write the letter  laura i focus  matt okay so you have a fragment of possibility  laura depending on how i roll i can roll again  liam take a hit of the dodec  laura ooh thats dexterity plus proficiency  matt im saying because its a forgery and its having to pay attention to details im going to  say intellect intelligence  laura really  matt yeah  liam /none/ did you roll twice  laura no i didnt roll twice okay  matt you dont have to roll twice you dont have to spend it if you dont want it  laura oh im going to spend it just in case proficiency bonus is just your initiative wheres  your proficiency  matt plus three i think  laura so 22  matt 22 pretty good forgery youre proud of yourself it looks pretty spoton based on his  handwriting youve followed his cadence his sentence structure his signature looks incredible  sam the dicks look like his dicks /none/  taliesin im impressed by the dicks actually  laura thank you thank you all right im leaving this on his desk  sam should you put it on the door with like a dagger  laura ooh  taliesin with his dagger  sam with his i left his dagger shit i could go back down the hall and get it  laura no ill just maybe tape it  sam i have extra daggers do you want a dagger i have three extra daggers  taliesin oh he had a quill didnt he  matt yeah  laura /none/ with a quill  sam yeah through the paper  matt ill say with your strength you can easily do so it will break the quill technically but  it still pierces it to the door there you go  liam angry writer  laura its pretty threatening its a feather  matt cool so the letter is complete and placed  laura should we go down and escape the other way so nobody sees oh i guess you guys already left  sam we already left were taking jorge to the docks right  travis no were all back /none/ together now  sam did we go to the docks  matt yes were okay this is my fault for forgetting one feature earlier and trying to fit  it into the narrative here order of business you arrived you forged a letter  laura we forged it  matt you saw a weird undead thing again that was following you and then fjord made it go away with  a hand wave you then took jorge to the docks and sent him on his way  sam great now where are we on the docks  matt you guys /none/ are near the docks youve made your way out  sam what do we do with jorge im kidding  laughter  travis well i feel like that kind of went about as well as it could have  marisha yeah  taliesin i think i should go get the boat  marisha yeah  taliesin im going to head towards where we anchored the boat  matt okay its still there floating you can see theres one fisherman whos eyeing it curiously  taliesin im going to cast calm emotions on myself and go swim to the boat  /none/ matt okay you go ahead and make your way out get up on the side of it and begin to row  yourself back to the edge of the dock there not far away is the old fisherman you had spoken to  earlier that you had borrowed it from you gather your things out of it and he comes over and is  like well i appreciate you bringing this back  taliesin its no problem i think ive had enough ocean for a while that was  matt no such thing no such thing  taliesin have a /none/ good day  matt you too tall one  travis what do we do now  marisha i turn around and i look at the city do i notice commerce does it look like things are  slowing down  matt make a perception check  liam are we now bane  marisha well that was a garbage roll seven thats terrible  matt it looks like the city i mean at this point in the day its getting a little later the  sky is starting to get a bit maybe the oranges of dusk are starting to peek /none/ in a little bit you  maybe have another hour or so of daylight  marisha do i see merpol anywhere  matt make a perception check  travis see who  marisha merpol that guy that i flirted with 11  matt currently no you dont see him anywhere  marisha thank god all right  sam we could go back to jesters mom and report we could go to that tower and investigate it  travis we could do both  sam we could  taliesin ill admit im a little tired  laura thats true  taliesin /none/ that was a lot  marisha we also wanted to check in to did we want to try and be at the docks at midnight  sam oh to meet marius  marisha yes he hangs out at the docks at midnight and does marius know sabian and cadmus  liam thats unclear at this point isnt it  matt yeah you dont know  liam do you have that letter by the way who has that  marisha the letter  liam the letter that mentions marius lepual  laura is he there every midnight or just tonight midnight /none/  marisha i dont know  laura because if we wait until tomorrow i can zone of truth him  marisha orly said he likes to hang out around the docks at midnight to look for work or something  liam caleb wouldve remembered that too i dont though  matt yeah i mean occasionally hes out there looking for work thats as much as orly knew  travis sabian was  matt marius  marisha sabian weve heard about through orly right  matt no sabian you heard about through fjord  marisha through what  travis me  /none/ marisha yeah but didnt we talk to like captain adella and someone else someone gave us the news  matt you got some information about sabian yes  marisha that they were doing the widows embrace thing and that theyre pirates  matt yeah that was through captain adella  marisha that was through adella okay okay okay okay sorry  travis lets make our way back towards the  under his breath jesus christ  marisha lavish chateau  travis yep ive got to take more organized notes maybe we can stop by the fancy tower on the  /town/ way back  liam i am very interested in that tower but i would love to ask some more questions around town  before assailing it  travis sure about what time is it  matt its close to dusk about an hour of daylight left  travis right you said that  sam do we go towards the lavish chateau  laura yeah lets go tell mama what we did  sam yeah  marisha well go to the lavish chateau and well just walk by the tower on our way back to give it  another looksee  /none/ matt okay its a little bit of a roundabout walk but you can do it all right so you make  your way back to the open quay heading towards the tower you can see as you approach based on  whatever illusory enchantment finds your vision you can see as it seems to grow the closer you get  to it to the point where its massively towering when youre right below it still no sign of a  door at first glance you still have the 20footup or so balcony and a few other windows  up that /none/ way you can see the top two windows have now that its gotten darker you can theres a  little bit of a firelight glow at the very top of it  liam have i ever read about anything like this a building that seems to shift in size  matt make an arcana check  laura can i look around and see if the city seems like its being affected at all by the no power  matt make a perception check  liam ten  matt ten you assume its either some sort of spatial enchantment to it /none/ or its an illusion  maybe thats as much as you can make out from it  liam okay  laura whispering natural 20  matt natural 20 the city doesnt appear to be heavily changed by any means  laura i think its fine  matt you do notice that where previously there were some plumes of white smoke or steam that rose  from certain more industrial aspects of the city are much thinner appearing to be more residual  columns of steam and smoke  laura oh god oh god oh god  sam well be fine /none/  travis no bigs  matt youre at the tower the tide peak tower anything you want to do  travis im tapped i cant do anything  sam you boys just wanted to come look at the tower again because you like it  travis yeah  liam dont look at me  marisha i mean kind of we wanted to see if it changed or if anythings different or if we see  a mysterious figure in a window  sam theres no windows  travis it doesnt bother you that it grows taller as you get closer /none/  sam its pretty freaky  travis no doors  liam oh its fascinating we learned that whoever owns this place owns the district isnt  that correct  matt yep  liam so someone in this district probably knows something about the person who owns the district  marisha its yussa errennis right  matt yussa errennis  sam hey caleb  liam yeah  sam you memorized the map of the underground pathways right  liam correct  sam do any of them run under this tower  liam well there was no marking for a tower  /none/ sam using your spatial beautiful mind techniques  liam no idea  matt make an intelligence check to see if you can overlay the memory of the sketch you saw with the  location in the quay  liam just raw intelligence  matt yep  liam that is a 16  matt 16 you feel like youve been able to take the two and map them together pretty well nothing  passes directly beneath the tower no the sluice isnt a wide network its a handful of  deliberately placed tunnels to make their way towards specific parts of /none/ different districts  liam that diagram wasnt elaborate enough for me to know the answer to that  marisha okay lets go to the lavish chateau  sam mmhmm  matt all right by the time you make it to the lavish chateau it is sunset the last bit of  light that vanishes over the horizon far over the ocean the lucidian ocean in the distance you  make your way to the interior where a number of folks have finally gathered maybe a handful six  or seven people are already in there enjoying meals having drinks you /none/ know that there isnt a  performance tonight but people are in there enjoying the relatively comparably classy  atmosphere as the familiar band plays their music what do you want to do  laura i also used another disguise self spell to make sure i stay  matt good call  laura tortley  sam are we just here to see your mom  laura yeah probably should tell her  liam i spiffed up my clothing again as well  matt okay  sam how do we get upstairs with you all tortley  laura just go upstairs /none/  sam all right lets go upstairs  laura okay i go upstairs  matt all right you guys make your way up to the third flight you missed him last time but you  come upon the familiar sight to you which was your mothers personal bodyguard for half of the  time at the chateau bluude  laura bluude  matt which was also responsible at times to watch you and escort you when you went to the city the  rest of you are caught offguard by the sight of this massive dualhorned minotaur  travis oh /none/ shit  matt wearing a very very fine shirt but is donald ducking it the rest of the way thankfully  relatively thick thick fur down there youd have to pry to get a good look but is standing there  arms crossed and goes oh jester he comes over and picks you up actually no he wouldnt  recognize you because youre a tortle  laura doesnt he know that i am jester still  matt probably not not unless you say anything  laura bluude its me  matt now we go into the oh jester there we /none/ go thats the moment  laura my tortle eyebrows are going like this  matt right right  liam this ones name is bluute  laura his name is bluude  liam not bluute but bluude  matt with a d  liam with a d okay  laura were here to see mama  matt of course i assume that is the case he knocks on the door at that point the door opens  up a bit and peeking through is the ruby of the sea marion whose hair is perfectly curled even  without an evening performance /none/ she smiles at the sight of all of you at the door and looks  curiously at the large skirtfaring tortle  hello  laura hi do you have company  matt not at the moment no  laura can we come in and talk to you for just a second  matt oh jester hi yeah please do come inside everyone come on you all make your way  into the chamber  laura ill drop the disguise spell once were inside  matt okay she shoos out her servants and the door closes  sam oh this is /none/ yasha has she met yasha  laura whispering this is yasha  matt she has not shes like oh my goodness it is so nice to meet you yasha she shakes her  hand and yasha awkwardly hi and looks to the rest of you and leans towards the back wall and  crosses her arms not one for social graces necessarily but seemingly looking at marion  looking at jester looking at marion and can see the relation marion sits down in front of her  mirror and her little table set up in the corner spins back towards /none/ the rest of you welcome back  there is no performance tonight i apologize but if you would like us to provide food for you or  whatever you like please do not bother to let me know  laura so you know that guy  matt there are a number of guys that i know yes  laura the guy that was bugging you  matt algar yes  laura we went to go talk to him but he had already left  matt he left  laura yes he had fled the city apparently things happened they were /none/ real bad or something  i dont know  matt huh well that may very well be a great turn of luck in my benefit definitely thank you  for looking into that  laura of course yeah we were going to talk to him and everything but he is gone so  matt  well that makes me feel more comfortable thank you very much  laura of course  matt i appreciate it  laura do you guys want to eat anything  sounds of agreement  matt very well i will ensure that you are all properly /none/ taken care of this night clapping  twice she goes ahead and brings the servants back in a meal is placed for the rest of you and as  the evening progresses and you take a bit of time to rest  marisha like a short rest  matt yeah go ahead and take a short rest you guys manage to enjoy probably one of the better  meals youve had in a while  sam jester why did you lie to your mom  marisha yeah  laura is my mom still in this room  sam were whispering /none/ she cant hear us  laura look heres the thing  matt you guys are eating downstairs theyre not bringing room service up into her chambers  liam oh so were no longer with marion  matt not at the moment no  liam okay  laura look i dont want her getting in trouble for anything that happened  sam why would she get in trouble we did it  laura i dont know the less she knows the better what if she found out something and she  judged me for it because we did something bad  /none/ sam what if she finds out you lied to her and judges you for that  laura she wont why would she find out  liam you know i had the same thought really either she believes jester and no big deal or she  doesnt believe jester and knows that its taken care of  sam you should never lie to your mother  laura well i usually dont its just to protect her it is a white lie  sam all right  matt you hear the heavy footfalls of bluude making his way down the stairs and /none/ goes and finds  a corner just to keep an eye then marion now dressed in her casual evening gown which in  itself is still regal and beautiful and trails behind her up the stairs as she descends comes to  join you at the table and sits she smiles at the rest of you and gives a renewed nod to yasha whom  she just met well i am very happy to see that youve made a good group of friends a travel  family just warms my heart  travis yeah  marisha yeah  matt is /none/ everything all right  marisha yeah  laura oh no is it bad what did i do was it bad  sam you didnt do anything no this is very good  liam jester feels like that perhaps she is imposing bringing all of us here and we are  trying to convince her that that is silly  matt not in the slightest jester this is no imposition im just happy to have you home for a bit  laura im happy to be home for a bit  matt how long do you intend to stay  laura /none/ oh well i dont know were here for fjord really so its up to him  travis thats not true this is your home its where youre from  laura werent you trying to find out about the guys  travis yeah we have time  laura fjord swallowed a ball and its inside of him now and he doesnt know whats going on so  travis were going to tell the truth about that  matt i have a friend who had a similar problem years ago if you would like there is a physician  we could have /none/ take a look at you and see if we can a way to no longer have that problem  marisha oh man i want to hear that story  travis i would be glad to  laura mama its not that kind of ball he swallowed  sam you had a friend that swallowed a stone  liam frau lavorre you have such a lovely daughter shes so charming and such a spitfire  it has been such a pleasure to get to know her ive been curious for weeks now almost months i  think its been almost months /none/ what she was like as a child because shes such a joy now  matt ah young jester was rambunctious curious ever running off getting into well trouble and  finding trouble making trouble for me it was a joy she was very quick to learn ever smiling  brightening any chamber she walked into she had a good sense for who needed to be taken down a peg  liam so she was always a prankster  matt very much so more so around adolescence i think  laura yeah i guess so  matt but she has always /tavern/ been sweet inspirational  laura very sweet see i am very sweet  matt very proud of her  marisha do you have any good embarrassing stories  matt yes but not anything i can speak of in mixed company  marisha are we in mixed company  matt you guys are in the downstairs in the main tavern area of the chateau  marisha right right  laura i didnt get to come down here very much and eat with you its nice to be able to be here now  matt i agree  laura shit im not /none/ disguised

mask that i bought when i was with you im going to put it on  sam yeah thats good dinner wear  matt its a big old cast iron tiki mask with giant tusks oof all right  travis with tiefling horns and tail coming out of it  matt /none/ curious choice but i understand probably for the best there is not much of a mouth hole  so eating is going to be very difficult takes a little spoon and is like all right here we go  try to make it there it is perfect you guys talk for a bit she shares some embarrassing  stories of jesters childhood asks each of you a little bit about your story and well say for the  better part of the evening its an enjoyable respite from the chaos of the day and the chaos of  the journey /none/ your blink dog has dried as has your weasel  marisha oh yeah can i go check on professor thaddeus  matt you can and as you go ahead and find there is a coat room essentially where the young  man who had originally met you when you got there is inside you can see him sitting in the back on  a stool going like this hes staring in the far way and theres a coat rack where professor  thaddeus is sitting on there staring at him as you enter the chamber  marisha hey  matt /none/ oh hey  marisha is my bird okay  matt you can see theres some scratches on his cheek yeah hes fine just watching him right there  marisha uhhuh you didnt traumatize him did you  matt i think not hard

this  oh no six fuck that die  travis im going to have an /tavern/ owl  matt he dives towards you and goes right over your shoulder and is now in the middle of the  central tavern fluttering the leather cord of his leash is now dangling as hes up in the  rafters hooting  marisha i cant control him you guys he has a mind of his own hes a free person  matt everyone in the chambers like therere people that are eating who are like what the  theyre all staring up at this owl that has now found a brief perch up into the roof chamber  marisha /none/ oh youve all seen an owl before shut up  travis i think theyre worried about the whistles  marisha itll be fine  liam caleb summons frumpkin the octopus and i rub his head like a bond villain staring at beau  matt squeaks like a balloon  taliesin im going to pull one of the beetles out of my staff and say professor you want a  snack i hold it up  matt youre holding the beetle  taliesin yeah  matt make an animal handling check  sam oh boy there goes your finger  taliesin /none/ 12  matt eventually it dives down snatches and a little prick on the finger from one of the  talons but eventually makes a quick meal and heads back up  marisha sorry  sam what happens if we have to leave and the bird is still here  laura you can climb up yeah youre a monk you can climb up to the ceiling hey mama  matt yes  laura will you watch my puppy well its me and beaus puppy really  marisha yeah  laura will you watch our puppy while we go out tonight /none/  matt of course to be honest ive been thinking about maybe having a pet so this

heading towards where  travis the  sam you know the docks  matt yeah well theres the restless wharf and theres the /none/ open quay  sam we were told maybe one of those  matt the place that you had heard this information  liam did orly say specific docks  travis it was the open quay right was where he wanders at midnight  marisha we were at the wayfarers cove which is in the restless wharf  matt you didnt get any specifics he just said near the docks but you were in the restless wharf  when you got this information  liam yes yes  matt all right whos helming a lookout  taliesin ill do that  /none/ sam i put up my hood as well  liam weve got lamplight on the streets to varying degree  matt yeah there are torch poles set up towards the wharf that are giving a faint bit of light  but other than that its not a full moon but its mostly full and theres quite a bit of  moonlight coming down over the dock you can see it glittering across the water in the center of  the harbor there are a number of ships quietly set out in that vicinity the starclustered sky  completely envelopes the /none/ air above you its a beautiful view the closer you get to the docks  you can hear the sound of waves crashing from out of view the creaking of wet wood filling the air  as the docks shift and the number of boats that are currently moored to the center of the harbor  creak from side to side as the water comes in every now and then you see the slow glowing beam  of the lighthouse pass overhead about once a minute or so its a very slow moving pulsing  rhythm now ships of varying /none/ sizes sit across the dock spread tied to their various posts all  seemingly lightless and lifeless in their slumber theres no one doing any sort of evening work on  these ships at this hour you see a handful of zolezzo patrolling up and down the sides of the  dock doing their rounds no urgency or direction necessarily make a perception check if you dont  mind clay  taliesin thats a 26  matt 26 jesus okay then you  liam wise as fuck  matt you watch out for one of the westernmost docks of the /town/ district to see a shady figure  darting between patrols watching as the zolezzo will pass and then use that moment to dart across  the street and wait for the next zolezzo to pass and then make their way over to the edge of the  wharf you see them now ducking near a stack of empty shipping crates and they wait every now and  then glancing over when a zolezzos not nearby or looking towards one of the darkened ships that is  anchored towards one of the dock extensions not that far from one of the /dung/ docking cranes thats  left still after an evening of offloading from one of the other ships  taliesin hmm  laura what do you see  taliesin i mean its pretty quiet other than that guy hiding over there by the shipping crates  theres really nothing to see  laura is he blond is he a blond halfelf  taliesin its really dark i dont know other than that theres nothing really happening  laura theres a guy darting  sam should i go dart after him  laura ooh  travis yes  taliesin are we playing /none/ darts  laura wait do you want blessing of the trickster  sam ah what does that do  laura it gives you advantage on stealth checks  sam okay great  liam episode 30 something  matt you do watch as a zolezzo holding one of their portable torches and a sheathed sword  glances over in the direction of where that shaded figure is steps towards it and holds the torch up  and begins a soft call out hello the shaded figure stands up and approaches hands open  smiling getting a better look you do see /none/ finer elven features a lighter ashy hair thats short  on the sides and flopped in the front who approaches talks briefly you cant really hear  what theyre saying its hushed but puts something into the hands of the zolezzo the  zolezzo takes a moment nods and then turns around and leaves his post  taliesin thats really useful information  laura ooh  taliesin yeah  matt the figure goes and then darts back behind the crates once more and keeps looking over  towards that one single ship thats about 35 or 40 feet from where /none/ hes sitting  laura i wonder what hes waiting for  marisha yeah looks like someone thats waiting for a handoff if ive seen them  taliesin i wonder how much he paid to bribe the guard  marisha apparently five gold is a great going rate  laura thats true thats what we did  marisha yeah  taliesin huh  sam seeing as theres no guard im going to dart over towards where hes hiding but not right on  him or anything across the way  matt make a stealth check with advantage  sam ooh thats /town/ a one thats slightly better  marisha ooh thats right  sam stealth 17  matt okay you make your way over to the side of the docks on the opposite end and theres a little  step up from this edge of the street and you have a few buildings begin to give way the road ends  and there are bits of it that break off and fall off the short cliffs into the water theres the  docking crane to your left on a bigger piece of the dock thats out of the way but its blocking /none/  a lot of the view on this side the ship that this figure is focused on and the crates that hes by  on one side you get to the other and keeping quiet you dont think youve been noticed  sam mmhmm okay  matt make a perception check  sam perception check nine  marisha ooh nine  sam yes  matt youre waiting not much else seems to be going on  sam nervous chuckle great well im ready for anything  matt okay you just sit there and wait  sam yeah  matt okay /none/ the rest of you doing anything  liam yeah while all that was happening im halfway through as a ritual spell casting find  familiar so i can change frumpkin to something else  matt okay  liam ill tell you in a minute  matt mmkay you begin casting that caduceus as this is happening there are a few of those torch  poles set up and theres one at each dock nexus the one by that ship the light flickers out  marisha motherfuckers  taliesin well thats a thing you guys see that  marisha yeah  /none/ laura yeah yeah yeah  matt you dont see that and youre not close enough to hear any of this you see as a handful  of figures seemed to have come out of that ship walked across the gangplank and put that  torchlight out  taliesin i think somethings happening  laura what do the figures look like  matt make a perception check for you if you want to glance or are you asking caduceus  laura i want to look  travis pass that 26  laura yeah right i cant tell  phone beeping  /none/ liam sorry laura  laura i got a 14 i cant really tell  matt she cant make out details and even from this distance you cant make out a bunch because  theyre all wearing either full cloaks or half cloaks that end right about just past the elbow  hoods up not uniform patchwork in color and make but theyre all obscuring their features intentionally  taliesin they look like pirates  travis should we go out and tell them were bearing gifts and shit  marisha i was just thinking that i think maybe a little bit /none/ of familiarity with some underground  might help the situation  travis yeah tell them were bearing gifts and we want to see the captain see what happens  taliesin yeah  marisha okay ill go with you on that  travis all right  matt nott you watch as the figure thats waiting stands up out of the spot looks around looks  that theres no zolezzo currently patrolling at the moment and begins now to step onto the dock  and walk towards the figures on the ship  sam oh i will trail behind  matt okay /none/ goes and approaches the figures theres now two that have stepped up to meet and  you can see now there are a few more that are still in the ship that are watching from  marisha how big is this ship is it like a ship or like  matt its a fair size id say from tip to end its about 50 or so feet single sail but a big sail  marisha any iconography on the sail  matt its currently furled up it looks like its a ship thats designed for speed more than cargo  /none/ but its a decentsized ship  sam the layout of the dock is the front of the ship near the dock is it pulled up is it  parallel parked  matt the dock as youre walking continues forward and then it turns a little bit at an  angle and there are other ships that are docked theres a smaller fishing ship on one side  theres a rowboat thats set off in the water there its facing towards you at an angle and is  currently anchored at the edge of where the dock turns to the right /none/ there is a gangplank set out  between that and the dock where the figures are stepping up theyre meeting right where that  gangplank is and where that torch was snuffed  marisha hey fjord youve got that fancy armor that helps you float do you think maybe you could  get underneath the docks overhear something  travis yeah i like that ill run and staying a good distance in ill drop off the docks under  the water and start swimming  sam seal team  matt

splash ten points  travis five  matt splashing the figures all of a sudden all stop and turn as well as the one who was talking  and they all look in your direction  laura i use thaumaturgy to make a dolphin sound  marisha yes yes yes queen yes  sam night dolphins  laura dolphin chittering  matt thaumaturgy its not so much /none/ an audio mimicry spell but you can make certain sounds  happen so ill say roll a performance check  laura aww seven  matt unconvincing dolphin chittering  laughter  matt it seems to not assuage their fears and more make them more worried and curious as to whats  happening you watch as the two figures there start looking over towards the initial figure that  you were following and are looking really aggressive towards them the figures hands are up  and are like stammering theres this heated conversation going the figures in the ship are  /none/ getting things at the ready that you cant see but it looks like they are very much on guard the  two that were talking one of them grabs the scruff of the figure and holds him there while  the other one blade drawn begins to approach the edge of the dock where that noise came from  marisha i turn to caleb and i go there i threw our engagement ring and our life and i fed it to  the rabies dolphins its over okay its over  matt make a deception check  laura i like /none/ that your ring made a loud splashing  matt make a deception check with disadvantage  liam because caleb is on the ground going  marisha deception with disadvantage okay 11  matt as you give this display the figure with the sword out that was looking for the edge of the  water where fjord was looks over at you and goes with the little bit of features you can see a  chin a scruffy beard poking out beneath the hood still with the blade there turns back gives a  hand motion towards the ship  travis /none/ i didnt even ask how far is the water from the fucking dock five feet or like 15 feet  is it a tall dock  matt oh its about ten

travis yes 15 is the save  matt that is a 15 13 plus two the guy at the front resists next guy behind him natural 16  plus two he resists the guy next to marius fails and marius fails you watch as both marius  and the enforcer standing on /none/ the gangplank their faces immediately go dull as they stare up at  this what you see as nothing you have no visual perspective on whats happening but suddenly they  both go slackjawed and stand staring up in the air at this empty space  travis yeah theyre incapacitated their speed is zero but if they take damage or if someone  else uses an action to shake the creature out of their stupor then they confused noises  marisha you just spiked their drinks basically  travis yeah ive bascially thundercat hod the eye up into the  /none/ matt yeah kind of all right so thats your action  travis yes  matt anything with your movement  travis nope ill come over here  matt all right you make your way to the edge of the dock right there perfect all right that  ends your turn its now the bowmens turn seeing you now casting the spell making a ruckus on the  dock nearby all three of them turn to face you this guys going to go ahead and shift over and  get a bit closer to the edge and all three of them /none/ are going to fire at you fjord  sam oh no  marisha what if we commandeered the ship  sam yeah become pirates  matt natural 20 on the first hit

points of piercing damage  arrows impacting theyre going to go ahead and then use their movement to back up a bit back into  the ship  this guys going to duck below over here they all duck low and theyre /none/ all going to  attempt to hide  sam nice smart kids  matt okay you watch as they all disappear into the shadows of the ships deck youre uncertain  where the bowmen are that brings us to beau and nott  marisha are we going in  sam i guess  laura just try to get marius out right  sam im hiding still so im going to pop up and shoot the guy next to marius  matt go for it  sam that is a

over and looks at you and hes  hurt pretty bad hes glancing over in your direction looking at the rest of everyone there  seeing how /none/ things are shifting looking to his ship he looks like hes planning something what  else are you going to do  sam bonus action ill shoot him again  matt go for it  sam not as good 17 to hit  matt 17 to hit that still hits  sam yeah eight more points of damage  matt death groans  cheering  matt he tumbles forward over and falls into the water  travis oh man we might get lucky marius  matt marius no  sam oh no i shot the wrong guy  matt marius /none/ is

say that knocks him out of his stupor  marisha well you know okay  matt when youre choking him and forcing to pull him backwards  marisha /none/ well you said grapple  matt yeah but grapple by putting your staff into his throat and pulling him backwards  laura its different  sam its a pretty harsh grapple  liam pretty harsh woman  laura shes a harsh girl  matt youve pulled marius back  marisha not a subtle person  liam whatever mama wants mama gets  marisha thats my turn ive got marius ive got marius  matt all right that finishes beaus turn that finishes notts turn now its the enforcers  turn one enforcer fell over keeled over dead the other one /none/ is going to step back out from the  inside for a second hes carrying a heavy crossbow that he has winched back pulls it up  and is going to spin and the first person he sees coming out of there is probably going to be  you beau because you are the one whos grabbing him and pulling him off the gangplank as he steps  out and looks and sees you  marisha do i have threequarters cover because im using him as a human shield  matt id say you have half cover because of the /none/ boxes that youve pulled up behind unless you  want to use him as a human shield thats up to you  sam were here to save you oh god block his arrow for me  taliesin everyone has to pull their weight man  matt he gets two shots natural 20 and a 17 which i dont think hits right  marisha misses  matt yep that is 20 points of piercing damage  marisha do i get deflect missiles  matt you have a reaction still right  marisha yes i do okay 15  matt you take /none/ nine points 15  marisha yeah five plus my monk level plus dex right  matt is that how much it reduces it by total  liam just look through our 2000 rules here wait a second  matt i know thats fine  marisha oh and its also a 1d10 i just rolled a 1d8  matt okay reroll 1d10 plus your monk level plus your dexterity  marisha right see this is old but its or is it my proficiency bonus  matt no its monk level and dexterity youre right you totally got it go for it /none/  marisha okay im not a crazy person its not as good but 13  matt all right you take seven points of piercing damage that ends that that brings us to caleb  no sorry jester youre up first then caleb  marisha jester help  laura okay youre right are you hurting  marisha no im just i mean im not im okay  laura i guess this is really hard  marisha any assistance getting marius out  laura i dont have anything thats going to help get him out that i can think of  marisha /none/ yeah if you keep them away yasha and i can make it work  laura okay im going to cast fuck ill move forward well yeah to be closer to beau and  im going to cast fuck it sanctuary  matt on beau  laura yeah  matt all righty  sam like laura yeah  liam do you resurrect him  eeyore voice i guess  laura yeah sanctuary on beau so anybody that makes an attack against her has to either  whatever you know the spell then im going to sorry thats a bonus action  /none/ sam eeyore casts it  matt i know seriously  sam as eeyore you know anyone who tries to kill her can  laura im freaking out i dont know what to do  liam as eeyore it doesnt matter anyway  sam as eeyore were all going to die in the end  laura then im going to cast sacred flame at can i see anybody on the boat  matt right now you can see one guy on the boat  laura i guess im going to try to hit him  matt whats the range on sacred /none/ flame  laura 60 feet  matt he gets a what save is it constitution or is it wisdom  laura a dex  matt oh a dex that would be 13 thats a failure  travis sacred flame making it through  laura woo six points of damage yeah hold person that was a good one  liam yes it was that was a good move  matt its all good it was a good move  laura then im going to use the rest of my movement to go back to where i was  matt thats as /none/ far as you go you used the rest of your movement to get up to that point  laura cool  matt that ends your go caleb youre up  liam okay so factoring in a couple of things one is that i see my friend beauregard getting  hammered on by them which i do not like also i heard some voice from the boat yell out burn  it so out comes the bat guano and sulfur and slap and a beam rockets out 150foot range to  about here and erupts  travis please be shipping black /none/ powder  travis and marisha explosions  sam were killing everyone on the boat we dont even know who they are  travis who gives a shit they deserve to die  matt this is not a moral group by any stretch of the imagination theyre getting better than they  used to be but man  liam yeah vox machina is gone the point is to get it to a range where i know that its not going  to affect them on the dock its going to hit the boat  matt youre getting the boat in this /none/ too all right lets do it  sam to get the people yeah youve got to get the boat  liam yeah absolutely what am i a surgeon i have a 3rdlevel spell because i used arcane  recovery back at the chateau  matt okay specify that next time but sure go for it i know you would  liam i also took a poop while at the chateau but i thought i didnt  matt i know thats fine  travis i hope theres nobody important in the bow of the ship  taliesin theres so many things /none/ that could be going horribly wrong right now  marisha yeah a bunch of refugees wanting safe passage  sam dont worry sabian is hanging out below decks  laura is there any way to see what the name of that ship is is it on the side of the ship at all  matt youd have to spend an action to look for it the name would be towards the back and its  facing away from you  travis he wouldve painted that shit on there i dont see it in there  marisha everywhere on every panel /none/  liam 27  matt the enforcer fails so he takes the full 27 success success and failure  liam i will use my movement to step around the corner of the house and i will begin to count to  20 slowly in zemnian to calm my nerves  matt you move behind here im going to roll a saving throw for the ships sails not bad the  sails do not catch fire theyre charred a little bit from underneath but the ship isnt now  suddenly a giant burning torchlight beacon in the middle of the fucking /none/ harbor  liam i dont know if caleb is a firebug or if i am  matt i know i respect that  marisha i think its you  travis hey man if youve got fireball  matt that ends calebs go captains dead caduceus youre up  sam all the human cargo is dead  liam theyre still standing  sam no the slaves that were below deck  liam the guy came out and said burn all the slaves  laura no they said burn it all  taliesin yeah im going to throw a healing word at /none/ beau and im going to start getting out of  here i want to cast healing word its not a lot no its 60 feet  matt yeah youre within range  taliesin thats nice its eight points  matt there you go eight points to beau  taliesin yeah im going to start booking out of here  matt wherere you going  taliesin im heading back around the way i assume everyone else is going yeah that way  matt okay theres caduceus finishing your go yashas up  travis yashas going to rush up and aid beau /none/ in trying to pull marius towards the docks  matt okay if she wants to she can attempt to grapple and then pull him out of beaus grip or  we can say she holds her action and then it gets a little weird because its movement is what  you pull him out of the way  travis would it help make full speed when it comes back to beaus turn if shes assisting can  they double pull  marisha can she go and then i assist on my turn  matt ill allow it  travis yeah /none/ i guess do you want me to roll to grapple  matt yes because he is resisting amongst her grapple as well and its harder to do that  travis 15 plus her natural strength  matt yeah all right now its mariuss turn hes going to attempt to break free now that hes  full of mind and hes freaking out whats he whats going make an acrobatics check against  your athletics technically since youre both grappling either you or yasha can make the check  and its with advantage ill say because youre both holding  travis /dung/ god its an athletics check whats her athletics  matt strength is plus three and it would be at plus six probably  marisha ill do mine since mines also a plus six  matt all right go for it  travis and liam get it girl  matt oh he almost rolled really high  liam oh those are two bad dice rolls  marisha 11 total  matt he does still manage to break free yay  sam somethings going well for matt  matt hes going to run  marisha motherfucking piece of shit why would you /none/ do that  laura seriously they had a dagger to your throat you dick  sam the ships on fire  matt the ships not on fire but he has no reason to trust any of you and was meeting with these  people if hes going to choose between the two hes going to step into the ship there hes like  panting gets down low and is hiding but you know right where he is that brings us to the top  of the round fjord your turn  sam no problem we got this  liam fjord /none/ pulls out the big guns master plan here it is  travis yep im going to run over here  marisha we worked so hard to get him that far  travis counting im going to stand out here and ill unleash two eldritch blasts at this enforcer  matt at that guy you can look and see now he is not the enforcer that went below deck previously  hes dressed similarly but now that you get a better look at this view in the light hes  somebody else there is still one person down in the ship /none/  travis quietly awesome great good stuff louder thats a 20  matt that hits  travis 11  matt that hits roll damage  travis oh nice okay  matt yeah he has leather armor his ac is 11 hes pretty easy to hit  travis 11 points of damage on the first one and ten points of damage on the second so 22 total  matt ooh thatll do it both blasts take him down the attrition is not working well in his favor  laura inaudible  sam why dont we say that  laura whispering because /none/ im not up there and no one else is remembering  travis what that we come bearing gifts  laura the captain is what were supposed to say  marisha it feels like were really in battle now  matt caduceus you do hear a ways away not here yet but you do hear some voices and  footfalls armored footfalls you get the sense that zolezzo are on their way  taliesin guys were going to have problems soon we should probably get out of here  matt he will say on his turn when he gets there  /none/ taliesin oh no thats right im not there yet  matt the bowmen now whove been hidden below the deck and have endured the fireball two of them  are going to from their positions stand up and theyre going to take shots at you arrows  firing they have advantage on both because they were hidden from you that is a 19 to hit  travis hits  matt second one thats cocked advantage that is a 20 to hit  travis it hits punish me for this horrible fucking crap  matt they have sneak attack because they /none/ were hidden from you 29 points of piercing damage  from those two hits  laura are you still up  travis oh yeah  matt the third goes and unfurls the sail and pulls the rope and it begins to unroll a little  bit of wind is blowing it opens up a bit  laura do we see the sail does it have any markings on it  matt no it is fairly plain you get the sense that theyre now looking for a way to get out of  here ships arent the fastest when it comes /none/ to exits but theyre trying that brings us to beau  and nott  travis let them go what the fuck are we going to do run and jump on the goddamn boat  marisha i was about to do that yeah  matt at the end of their turn these guys are going to move back as well and attempt to hide again  liam fuck yeah  travis all right sure go for it  laura what you dont know how many people are on that boat oh my god  matt theyre not very good at hiding /none/ though laughs they rolled really bad all three of  them at once a one a three and a four  taliesin its a shame they never roll that way when theyre attacking  matt thats funny you see them duck down but theyre all pulling out their arrow and nocking it  into the bow and you can see exactly where theyre hidden whats the plan beau and nott  liam bone it  travis do what you were going to do do it  marisha you go first  travis do it  marisha are you going to /none/ go for the sail you could go for the sail potentially  sam thought about that  marisha if you could start it i could maybe rip it i dont know im spitballing here i dont  know what to do  matt make your choices guys  sam weve got two bowmen whos the guy in black over there the enforcer who came up  matt no the enforcers dead fjord just blew him up on the side theres now only three bowmen on  the deck and theyre all hurt really badly from the fireball explosion and they /none/ all think theyre  hidden but theyre not  travis go ahead and fuck them up man go for it  sam ill shit i want to use my sneak attack i will bonus action hide and then from my hidden  position i will shoot  matt move around the side all right against which one  sam the guy in black over there  matt go for it roll for attack with advantage because he does not see you  sam oh nice thats a 23  matt yeah that hits so go ahead and roll damage with /none/ sneak attack  sam that was a good roll  taliesin oh thats mean  sam 23 points of damage  matt the impact hits him and he falls back and hits the edge of the ship and then tumbles over  and splooshes into the water behind you hear no noise  sam i will use any movement to emerge from my hidden position and move up a bit to behind those  barrels maybe so i have a little cover  matt okay  marisha okay im going to run up and go after these two bowmen i /none/ guess fuck me what am i doing  travis were all going to die  matt you rush running across the gangplank as soon as you come to the edge you look down and  theres one of the guys whos about to turn with his bow and goes gasp and sees you  marisha i just roundhouse him to the face  matt go for it roll for an attack  marisha motherfucker ten  matt ten misses you go and kick and the water on the slick deck makes you slip you catch  yourself and dont tumble /none/ off the side  sam you got to wear boat shoes  marisha i havent rolled above a five all night okay  liam shes back  24 no 23  matt that hits you go for one roundhouse and slip using the momentum you spin with a lower  circle kick like a sweep kick which is about head level with him  marisha eight damage  matt eight points of damage thatll do it the bowmen dont have a lot of hit points  sam theyve been burned badly  matt he groan and then falls unconscious onto /none/ the deck of the ship  marisha do i have enough can i get the other guy  matt you do have enough movement you have 15 feet more so you leap down onto his crumpled  unconscious body and his other friend is going to pull back to try and take a shot while hes  backing up towards the back portion of the ship  marisha i go melee range you cant do it and then a 19  matt thatll hit go ahead and roll damage  marisha big money okay nine die die  matt and /none/ so he  you impact sound and he falls unconscious onto the ground  marisha i turn to marius and i say the gentleman sent us gentleman you a gentleman  matt hes like startled gasping make a persuasion check  marisha really  matt yeah  travis we need to get onto the boat and get out of here  matt you just killed or beat unconscious the guys he was coming to meet  liam we just flip this were going to jack this fucking boat and get out of here  marisha seven  matt seven he /none/ right now is looking panicked and the words arent coming through he thinks maybe  youre calling him a gentleman hes like panicked noises and hes backing away from you  liam ladies and gentlemen  laughter  matt all right that ends beau and notts turn  liam life is disappointing eh  matt you do hear what sounds like some movement the door is partially open to the cabin below and  there is light coming from the inside some sort of lantern light you hear things being moved around  marisha can i stand on top of /none/ the door do i have enough movement to do that  matt you have five more feet to get to the door and look beneath but you dont see anything yet  marisha i want to tamp it down stand my full weight on top of it  matt well the door is on the side so youd have to put your weight against it yeah  marisha okay  matt youre up against the door that brings us to jester  laura are we trying to get back on the boat now  travis yes  sam maybe  /none/ travis yes  laura okay i guess im going to fucking like an asshole run towards the boat god this is so  dumb i run towards the boat but im going to as far as i can  sam where are you  liam way far away  sam were going to have to fucking wait ten minutes  liam no you wont no you wont  matt you can make an action to

fucking boat  marisha jump jester jump  matt youre making your way across the gangplank like oh god youre just about to make it to  the ship and thats the end of your bonus dash caduceus youre up no sorry caleb  liam okay i see which way the wind is blowing i mutter a few arcane words and i cast the spell  expeditious retreat which is a transmutation spell so i will also send a little bit /none/ of arcane  energy to the transmutation stone to give myself extra speed as well  matt you can do that  liam i can use my action my movement and my bonus action to move full movement at 40  so vax is back  matt vax is back baby  liam i am now on the boat  laura oh my lord he can do it again  liam transmutation spell gets my movement up to 40 right  laughs roguishly  action movement plus now expeditious retreat is a bonus action  matt correct you can move /none/ 80 feet  liam 40 plus 40 plus 40  matt its a bonus action to cast the spell oh and when you cast the spell and then as a bonus  action oh wow so its a dash action as the spell when its cast as well so yeah thats 120 feet  taliesin whoa  liam a red blur goes zooming sound and i am standing next to beauregard on the boat  sam flash aah  taliesin hell save every one of us  laura he went so fast he knocked me into the boat  matt /none/ you do actually jester tumbles forward into the boat from the sheer force of caleb  zooming sound flashing into the space  liam are we stealing the boat  marisha oh were all here  laura does anyone know how to fucking drive a boat  sam no one on the boat does  matt all right that finishes calebs turn  marisha the guy whos definitely not here  laura oh my god the zolezzo are going to come  matt from around this corner  marisha oh no we swear were not pirates  liam way to /none/ build that tension  matt begin to appear and now the zolezzo that are coming around the corner are coming forward  with torches there are more a little further down the way and theyre shouting out whats going  on what is looking around they can see you fjord they can see yasha up on the side and they  can see people on the ship across the way  sam oh no  matt but thats their turn theyve acknowledged you and theyre telling you to halt and theyre  asking for your attention now its going to /town/ turn to caduceus turn they do not see you the sound  you heard you couldnt quite make out the direction its coming from but you can now hear  it coming from around the edge of the street  taliesin im going to ponder im going to make the sound of a bunch of people panicking and  saying hide everything hide everything  matt with  taliesin with thaumaturgy  matt youre stretching the cantrip a bit  taliesin no i thought you can create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point  of your choice within /town/ range  matt its a sound like a bird caw you cant create the sound of a whole crowd screaming  taliesin thats fair thats fair  laura you can do ominous whispers its listed  taliesin it is listed im going to make one of the doors on that boat over there slam shut really loudly  matt door slamming sound it does so  taliesin im going to run and hide behind the map im going off the map around there yep  marisha youre going the other way away from everybody else  sam oh no  /none/ taliesin im going to just be going  marisha well catch you upstream  travis hes going to go hang with the ruby  laura we cant get the boat out of here fast enough before they can catch the boat  matt all right go ahead and actually no this would be on their end  taliesin thatll just be 30 feet and im not running im walking  matt it does catch their attention and they look over and the few that hadnt seen fjord now look  over and see fjord on the dock as well there /none/ you go they are aware of those that are currently  visible on the deck of the ship and fjord and yasha over there  marisha great  matt that ends it yashas turn whats yasha going to do  travis yashas going to run her ass onto the boat double dash if she needs to  matt she doesnt need to with her speed she gets onto the ship there  travis right and she will assume the dodge whatever in case they throw fire or something at her  matt okay that brings us to the top of /none/ the round fjord your go  travis im going to arnold schwarzernegger from true lies run and jump off the dock and dive into  the water heading straight towards the boat in a straight line because my speed is the same on land  or in the water and i will double dash to the boat  liam into the abyss  laura bloop  liam oh man all in one movement thats  marisha thats rad  travis ill be like were getting the fuck out of here shove off  matt as you do that the guards /none/ are going hey hey halt and theyre drawing and loading  crossbows you are not stopping you are not hailing you are not listening to anything theyre  saying they assume you are stealing a ship which you are  sam which we are  laughter  taliesin am i going to be the only survivor in this thisll be funny  matt the sails are unfurled  sam sail  matt its still anchored you notice as you get to the dock  travis are we tied up too  matt yeah they were just starting to get the /none/ process going of getting the ship done and there  is still somebody down inside rummaging through the interior  sam were off unsuccessful noise  matt yeah you as a sailor you get there and asses the situation and youre like this is  going to take a little bit to get the boat out of here  sam no problem  matt i mean through natural means i dont know what you have at

was  putting his hands up and was shouting hey to hail you and was asking whats going on has no  choice but to assume that youre destroying the dock and stealing a ship now because you are  hes going instead to pull out his heavy crossbow and load it theyre going to move up to the side here  sam remember how jester you couldnt come back to this town  marisha yeah  laughter  sam well now we all /none/ cant youre never going to see your mom again sorry  matt the weird butterfly effect of dd actions  travis this was just fucked from the first  sam we were just going to have a conversation with

travis okay  matt both against jester terrible rolls that is a 12 and ten they both just whiff past oh  no those were against yasha  laura yeah because im crouched  matt they could have seen you but

 taliesin i dont have a better way around  matt no thats it  taliesin unless theres a window unless theres an open passage on the back of one /none/ of those houses  matt there is its a closed window but you could try and break it  taliesin oh no thats too  matt okay so youre over on that side thats the end of your turn  marisha just add be to the list  matt why not just go all in yasha  taliesin thats the best i got right now  travis we want to pull up the anchor or are we moving yet  marisha i only unfurled so if yasha can yank up that anchor thatd be dope  matt all right so /none/ yasha goes over to the side pulls it up grunts gets it on the inside  marisha now were ready to go  matt youre now currently not tethered to  travis with her movement shell stand in front of marius like a human shield from any arrows  that might be coming  matt okay shes trying her best to protect marius  sam now weve just got to wait for the wind guys  laughter  laura wheres keyleth when you need her

marisha please dont be a dumbass marius  matt no no hold on marius moves past yasha  travis do i get an attack of bitch slapping  matt he gets up to the top of the edge of the ship and let me roll for him to see if  thats actually pretty good okay he glances about the scenario takes in his chances and  whats happening and /none/ stands up and goes hold hold please this is a big misunderstanding  lets talk this out  sam to us or everybody  matt to the guards for the sake of this im going to have one of you guys roll for him who  wants to roll his  sam i will roll  matt persuasion check with disadvantage  sam terrible both were threes  matt no  laura why did you roll why didnt you roll  matt because it would make it more interesting okay yeah thats not having any effect on them  theyre

the water no  laughter  travis i dont fucking know can i double dash down into the bow of the or belowdecks where  caleb is  matt sure  travis ill do that  matt okay you make your way down and you

action or did i double dash to get down here  matt you said double dash it would have taken that to get there so all right  travis oh ill use my bonus action to cast hexblades curse on that enforcer with the hope  that he will soon be dead  matt all right now as he sees you and hes pulling the blade you rush into the fray and  what /none/ heavy shadows still lie in the bottom here with the little bit of lantern and fire light  thats lighting the space the shadows get darker around him and you can see everyones breath is  visible suddenly in this under chamber as the curse takes its hold on him that goes to beau and nott  marisha okay i go over to the rope of the sail and i pull it tight and the jib i dont know  i do something and i go fjord  matt beau has never been on a ship  marisha fjord

jade lucky jade lucky jade okay okay that was good /none/ 19 total  matt okay you look at it youve been watching boats come into harbor and youve read things  about it but mostly from your observational skills which is one of your focuses and  strengths beauregard youre like okay i think ive seen people you know making ships go you  grab the ropes you pull and you yank past and you watch as the sail picks up the wind and stiffens  marisha accented weve caught the wind ive heard sailors say that  matt its like beau for those purposes up on the top there /none/ holding the rope and youre like  ah okay theres a sail  marisha theres like a rudder right nott rudder the boat  sam i hate water  laughter  matt nott what are you doing  sam is anything constraining our movement is the gangplank in our way or are we unfettered at this point  matt as far as you know the gangplank is resting on there you dont know if its connected at all  sam were starting to drift a little  matt youre starting to drift a little bit the wind has picked up /none/ a little bit  sam okay then i will run up and tackle marius to the ground and wrestle him down get over here  you fucking get come on get down were trying to talk to you  matt make an athletics check to grapple  sam ooh wow athletics oh thats just a straight 18  matt straight 18 yeah like a wet paper bag he goes over ah boof and they both slam onto  the deck below you have him grappled and youre like holding him down youre not you dont  weigh a lot but /none/ youre leveraging and pulling the weight in a way where he cant his knees are  buckled and he cant actually get any ground to hold himself up so you got him  sam okay thats all i got  matt all right the enforcer whos below who has the curse is going to go ahead and swing forward  two attacks with his blade this is going to be this is going to be against you fjord because  youre the one that came in and cursed him  travis yeah i know yeah  matt thats going to /none/ be a 15 to hit  travis it misses  matt impact shield off to one side natural 19  travis it hits  sam this is your like favored terrain and stuff its a boat  travis nope  taliesin this is a disaster  matt that is ten points of slashing damage  travis im uncon no ill use my relentless enfuckingslurred  sam were going to lose the sailor  laughter  travis well im up to one hit point  laura seriously  matt you groan you just manage to hold on by a thread your /none/ consciousness waning your eyes focus  angrily towards the target of your hexblades curse  travis just out of pitys sake im disappointed i came back up to one hit point  laura i dont even know thats happening  sam and taliesin no  matt all right that brings us to jesters turn  laura great im going to use my duplicate to run forward  marisha what are we doing  sam were saving the world marisha were saving the world  laura im going to use my pearl of power to cast my last remaining 3rdlevel spell /none/ and im going  to cast charm person on the three of the guards that i can see  matt okay ones up front  laura yeah sure  matt the one up here is the leader the one that was guiding them on stuff  laura okay yeah thats good  matt he fails with a natural three two natural threes in a row fucking lucky the third one on  the far end is a natural six okay so you are currently oh no its not concentration for  charm person those three are charmed  laura for /none/ an hour  sam were doing great guys weve killed everybody were charming people were on a boat  matt they are technically in combat with you  sam is frumpkin an octopus and is it lying back on the dock somewhere  liam frumpkin is not there  sam oh okay  laura it is charmed by you until the spell ends or until your companions do anything harmful to  it when the spell ends it doesnt say anything about it not being in combat  matt makes a wisdom saving throw and does so with advantage if /none/ you or your companions are fighting it  laura oh okay it doesnt say that on the thingy sorry  taliesin although they havent technically attacked oh no  matt yeah theres been enough aggressive action theyre considered fighting theyve all failed  their save im going to do one more roll for all of them the leader thats cocked thats a  natural 12 plus two 14 whats your dc  laura 15  matt 15 thats a natural ten and a natural 11 they all fail again yeah theyre all still  charmed well done  sam what /none/ are the odds  matt thats kind of crazy actually all right so well say the red here is charm person  marisha i can feel traviss dad disappointment like radiating  sam in himself  travis in myself yeah  sam and in us  marisha its hot  matt the three of them drop their weapons for a second and are looking confused the ones  behind are still loading and getting ready  laura okay i guess im going to stay hidden on my end and try to make my way down i cant do  anything /none/ below but okay whatever yeah yeah i guess im going to try to go no because im  going to keep visual on duplicate jester im going to stay hidden on the top  matt okay that ends your turn jester caleb  liam ja i rub a bit of honey across my lip and say mein freund i suggest you throw down your  weapons and lie under that desk just for your safety and i cast suggestion  matt okay this is a natural seven thats a failure after slashing into fjord and turning  towards you and /none/ seeing that fall he throws his weapon down and crawls under the table angrily  like grr im going to get you under this table and then he gets there and looks very confused  liam i would like to use movement to zip up to the top and look around  matt lets see here yeah well say thats what his next action would be since technically its  out of turn  liam you mean climbing under the desk  matt yeah its happening simultaneously  liam i use my movement to zip up and look around and /none/ my bonus action to zip back down into the boat  matt you look up and you see this scenario you see the guards are still standing there at the  edge the ship is moving its slowly pulling away  laura dont hit those guys in the front  matt that brings us to the guards turn the two in the back are going to go ahead and fire thats  going to be one at beau and one at yasha against beau that is a 17 to hit  marisha miss  matt against yasha that is a /none/ 16 to hit i believe that does hit she doesnt have a huge  armor class if i recall she does take only five points of piercing damage  travis is that already halved because of raging  matt well she hasnt attacked anything  travis youre right that would fall yeah  matt did she take damage last turn oh she was attacked last turn so shes still raging  travis oh she did  matt but there were a few rounds there where she didnt hit anything so the rage fell  laura the guy that targeted beau /none/ has to make a wisdom saving throw  matt oh thats true he fails so he goes to fire and he has to choose another target  laura no he just fails if on a fail  sam no he can choose another target on sanctuary  matt its okay its a 1stlevel spell instead hes going to fire that at yasha as well okay  that is a failure that is a natural seven no damage outside of the damage that she took there  at that point the leader goes wait hold what are you doing stand back /none/ and the guys like  what are you talking about hold on we have to figure this out something is strange about this  hold up he starts shouting to hail in your direction and the other guards are putting their  weapons away and are about to walk over the two in the back are like what  sam wow  matt yeah they are not sure whats happening they are not perceptive enough to have seen that  its a spell effect that has changed them theyre confused by it well see if they figure it out  /town/ soon with that these guys are going to begin to walk and make their way toward the broken docks  liam possibly burning  matt they see the illusory guy there and look confused  laura it just looks like me though  taliesin no theres another guy  matt theres the guy just waving to them thats all hes doing repeatedly hes like one of those  mannequins holding the electrical signs on the street yeah hes a wacky waving  taliesin a wacky waver  matt a halforc  liam hes got the cardboard arrow spinning it  /town/ taliesin freestyle  matt these guards are going to chase up confused and theyre going sir sir sir and theyre  not entirely certain whats going on theyre really confused by the scenario thats going to  go to caduceus  taliesin im going to npc my ass right across the street  matt 25 30  taliesin im going to see if i can take my action and keep going quietly oh no im not going  that im going to go behind those im getting in the water  matt oh this way  taliesin yeah im getting /none/ in the water  sam in the water  taliesin yeah  matt 25 30  taliesin im going to gently get in yeah im sitting in  matt its a tenfoot drop  taliesin oh is it a tenfoot drop  matt yep  laura can you lower yourself youre pretty tall  taliesin can i climb down instead of jumping  matt sure make an athletics check  taliesin all right  liam is he kaijusized  taliesin i am very tiny looking right now come on oh my god that was almost terrible nine  matt nine /none/ you slip and fall a little bit you get down about five feet and you make a splash sound  taliesin theres a lot happening  travis the docks on fire for crying out loud  matt yeah they dont notice  taliesin im going to slowly start making my way underneath everything quietly and with  matt five ten 15 20 yeah youre slowly wading through the water  taliesin yeah  matt okay that ends youre go yashas turn  travis yashas going to turn and bear hug marius  sam im already on him  travis awesome /none/ shes going to assume the dodge is there anything else to do  laura can she help try to get the ship to move more  taliesin does she know boats  travis does yasha know boats  matt yasha as far as you know does not know boats shes never mentioned anything about it  and yasha looks like she doesnt know what shes doing shes not giving orders or rushing to take  a post  travis i mean i suppose she could run over to the gangplank and she could try to pull it and  shove /none/ it against the dock and push off  sam the old plank shove  matt yasha will go ahead and push on the gangplank make a strength check for yasha shoving off  travis 26  matt she shoves and the whole boat shifts suddenly the gangplank plunges down into the  water and its floating there on the top the ship gets shoved off about ten feet in that direction  liam who could have predicted this  music  marius is just standing there held by a goblin going ah  sam stay down stay down  matt /none/ all right all right and he stays quiet there and doesnt do anything fjord  travis ill back up to the top of the ship where i should be useful  matt 15 feet of movement to get up there  travis do i have an action  matt you have 15 more feet of movement and you have an action  travis ill climb up onto where the rudder is  liam oh you want this seafaring knowledge what can you give me  matt you get up and man it  travis i start turning the bow of /none/ the ship out towards the sea  matt it starts arcing and making its way in that direction turning slowly  travis im smashing my head into the fucking bow  laura dont do it you only have one hit point  travis i fall unconscious when i wake up this will all be over i do that  laura no you dont  travis yes i do  laura fjord  liam thats a bad idea  laura dont do that  travis i do it  matt okay fjord in a fit of frustration and anger once the /none/ rudder is locked in place and the  ship begins to turn in position bashes his head in very much a this is so stupid movement  it doesnt knock you unconscious but you are dizzy as fuck you have you hit your head real  hard on there to do a point of damage do you want to do that  travis no thats fine frustrations good enough  matt frustration youll hurt yourself but to take a point of damage  travis frustrations fine  matt youre like ugh theres a little bit of blood trickling out from /none/ where the head got mashed  a little bit the partially splintered wood from the explosion of the fireball earlier  laura oh god are we going to sink  taliesin why would you say that out loud whats wrong with you  travis no thats appropriate for today  matt that ends fjords turn now the ship is moving on initiative 20 the ship moves out and is  over there now and is turning this way that brings us to beau and nott  marisha i see fjord bash his head against the wall and i go you /none/ guys i think fjords under  some sort of influence magic hes not himself then i yank the  matt youre just using your action to hold onto the sail and keep it open  marisha tell me what to do  travis oh right you dont know how to sail the ship  marisha you motherfucker  matt youre the only one really  travis hoist the thing and then the other one  marisha i try and interpret what he says hoist the thing  matt listening to the thing you eventually get her to figure it out /none/ you get the sail situated  and that will be your action for the turn okay nott  sam i will spend my action seeing if theres any rope lying around and trying to tie the mans  hands up  matt there is a couple of coils of rope left there in the far corner of the youll have to  release him to go get it  sam i will keep him and i will mage hand grab some rope and bring it over to me but then that  will be my action  matt still holding /none/ him because hes keeping quiet the rope hovers over and plops next to you  sam then bonus action i will use mage hand to start looping it around him  matt okay go ahead and make a sleight of hand check for me well just a general dexterity  check actually youre not proficient in this necessarily so just add your dexterity modifier  sam ten  matt okay youve begun the process its not an immediate  sam oh wait no its just a seven thats bad  matt youre not a master of rope tying necessarily this /none/ round the ropes are slipping  and while marius is fighting against it a little bit youre not getting too much of a hold on it  all right that ends your go the enforcer below who has completed the now is when hes ducked  behind because he lost his action to do that he now gets under the table throws his weapon down  and goes what the fuck goes to pick up the weapon thats his turn jester you go its so ridiculous  liam did he just break it is that what caleb saw  marisha /none/ he realized he was being dumb  sam hes just doing it  liam hes got to do it  matt no but he performed the action  liam right  matt yeah spell ends  laura im going to pull out my axe the duplicate and im going to act like she hits  herself with it so stupid and go dying noise and falls into the water  taliesin thats pretty good  sam she commits suicide in front of him  matt the leader goes no who considers you a friend at the moment and is seemingly /none/ really  distraught to watch this happen  sam what is happening  laura shes going to be floating in the water and then im going to go  matt i take it youre not concentrating on your silent image anymore  sam im probably focusing on marius so no im not  matt okay that vanishes right as she kills herself and falls into the water very confused  laura then im going to for my action as jester go and try to hold the door shut for the under  matt okay you move up to the door /none/ and holding it there  laura but im crawling i dont want them to see me  matt youre keeping low yeah its half movement you still get there and youre prone  all right caleb  liam i just want to clarify i thought that i had told him to throw down his weapons and hide under  the desk for his safety thats not an ongoing thing  marisha he did that  liam but you dont go down and then immediately stand up and get out again do you  marisha he saved from the spell  /none/ liam oh he saved from the spell  matt no how it works is you give them a task he went and hid under the table for safety which  he did  liam hiding under the table for six seconds is a shitty job at hiding but okay  matt but it wasnt specific enough it wasnt a very specific suggestion  liam okay thats fine i have to totally rethink everything so give me ten seconds i will use my  action to run forward and with the edges of my coat put out the burning papers  /none/ laura are you downstairs i thought you were upstairs  matt no you locked him down there youre in here with me all right you put out the fire  you can see now it looks like what was a map that is mostly burned entirely  liam do i see anything as im doing this yeah if im looking at it  matt on the map yeah you see part of the coast and you see some notes and you see something on  there clearly looking at it there is information on it but youre putting it out /none/ blowing  liam okay thats it im done i would say that probably what i wouldve done not knowing any of  that is zip up to go up and then see if the door is shut and go and thats the end of my turn  matt thats going to be your turn that brings us to the guards turn the guards in the back are  shaking the other guard what are you doing theyre getting away hes like look this is a  very confusing scenario and were trying to ascertain whats happening they seem safe for /none/  now but why did this dock explode  laura also theres a girl floating in the water  matt she just killed herself go check on her make sure shes okay the guards like natural  20 theyre like this is foul magic he starts slapping him in the face and hes like get  away and hes like call a mage we have to get this taken care of  travis ooh the mage a mage or the mage  laura and liam a mage  matt they start shouting for help frumpkins still hanging out over here /none/ i figured you  wouldve blinked frumpkin  liam yeah i was casting find familiar  matt you still have an octopus frumpkin with you the guards are now  marisha yeah it interrupted that with the fight  matt yeah theyre momentarily distracted by all the things that have happened the ship getting  away and their leaders essentially acting really dumb and now ascertaining that its magical they  dont know what to do so theyre starting to shout out and one of thems starting to leave and  go to get help they start darting this way /none/ shouting these guys all begin to inspect and try  to see if they can find the poor woman this guy dives into the water to try and see if he can save her  laughter  matt hes now swimming in the water going where are you no you have so much to live for  laughter  matt thats their action caduceus  taliesin im swimming full speed directly out into the ocean  matt 30 thats as much as you can get its half movement in the water  laughter  sam hes never seen the ocean /dung/ before  laughter  taliesin oh yeah no im not having a good  liam so brave  taliesin this is not going well for me im not a happy camper  sam do you even have dark vision  matt and taliesin no  sam youre swimming out into the dark  laughter  liam theres torches for now  matt yeah theres a single torch over here that is loosely lighting the vicinity  taliesin and i assume that theres some kind of light on the  matt for caduceus you do have a high passive perception there /none/ are shapes in the water below  sam oh my god  taliesin would i have noticed that before swimming 30 feet out  matt no they werent immediately at night no youre getting out under the dock and you and a  little bit of light thats coming through from the moonlight you look and you can see something in  the water  marisha oh god  matt that ends your turn yashas go  travis oh yashas  liam 40 feet off the dock  marisha help me yasha  travis yasha assists beau in getting the /none/ ship  matt sure youre just holding the ship not much else to do  marisha oh my god  matt all right so at this point marius is theres not much else he can do fjord your turn  travis keeping an eye out for caduceus start to steer the ship along the coastline this way  matt all right make a perception check please  liam wow fjord  travis 18  matt 18 you do  sam thats right theres an old man swimming in the ocean  matt you do see  laughter  marisha geriatric /none/ bathing  sam oh lord  laughter  taliesin

skull hes like ahh and you can  see him holding back hes holding the sword hes hurt but hes still coming at you  liam arrow noise i am standing next to fjord and beau  matt laughs all right with an immediate burst of speed /none/ in a rush very akin to the flash making  his way through the city caleb just poof appears there on top with fjord and beau  liam feels good man  matt the guy whos now looking at you jester you see the guy had his sword out and ah  looks confused and sees you and goes growls and is going to come up with the sword he doesnt  realize how fucked he is he doesnt know

laura i didnt want to kill him like that wasnt my goal but i didnt say that out loud  matt you didnt say that out loud  liam stress of the moment  sam he dead  matt its not your /none/ turn you dont have a bonus action because its a reaction you wouldnt be  able to use it until next round  taliesin oh yeah  laura sorry it really wasnt my intention to do that i was aiming for his shoulder and i missed  and hit his head  travis it wasnt my intention the name of this episode  marisha thats great  taliesin that or the ac of wood  matt the ac of wood is a good alpha title  taliesin from it wasnt my intention  matt as you pull away out into /dung/ the main harbor fjord for the first time in a long time you  feel as the stress of the sequence passes over you the sensation of being at the helm of a ship  bypasses the momentary frustration it feels good to feel that wind in your hair again and to be  guiding it through the waters and seeing the dark horizon in the distance you feel that bald rage  subside looking past you can see the guards are still running up the streets with their torches  therell probably be a search party  marisha and /none/ laura singsong you can never go back  matt the good news is you dont think they were paying attention to the back of he ship thanks to  the distraction that you set so they dont know the name of the ship that might help to your advantage  marisha which is  matt it is called  laura widows embrace  matt no it is not it is called the mist  travis with an i or a y  matt with a i  laura the mist  matt now pushing past midnight to the very early /none/ morning hours you make your way out and as far  away from the edge you can see the lights of nicodranas begin to fade a bit just enough where  you can feel comfortable marius is there bound by ropes there still wild eyed and looking at all  this all right then who the fuck are you  marisha who the fuck are you you piece of shit  sam we know his name  marisha i know who he is im asking him fucking piece of shit  liam thats all we know is his name  /dung/ matt my name is marius lepual  marisha no we know im saying youre a piece of shit  matt what did i do  marisha so many things  matt im very confused  liam what were you doing on the docks this evening  matt he looks around hes like i was coming to tell some business contacts of mine that something  they hired me for didnt pan out  laura gasp  travis yeah  laura do you happen to know where those business contacts came from these people do you know  matt i dont /none/ know theyre very mysterious  travis would it mean anything if we said that we come bearing gifts and that we are looking to see  the captain ill reach behind my hand and use minor illusion and create a little replica of the  cat eye sphere and hold it out in front of him  matt okay he goes why didnt you say that in the beginning  marisha i did say that i kind of did i was like gentleman  matt i dont know a gentleman i just know that i was supposed to look for /none/ that delivery  travis from who  matt whoever was going to bring it i didnt expect for you to come in here and slaughter my contacts  travis what are your ambitions with it

the cove never showed up and they had been waiting  in town for a few days and they were coming back and i this was the night where i was supposed to  tell them either bring it to them or the deal was off and i was supposed to give back the money  that i owed them so   liam i would like to point out that youre trapped on this boat with us  matt i know /none/ that i am very well aware of that right

avantika shes a right /none/ intense person ive only seen her once she doesnt really leave her ship  in port when shes in which is rare her reputation keeps her not from coming in directly  laura whats the name of her ship  matt well her ship is the squall eater  marisha squall eater  liam her reputation keeps her from coming in what is her reputation  matt shes a bit of a forceful taker of things she wants  laura shes a pirate  matt thats one word to say it if you want to find her your best bet /none/ is probably somewhere in  the swavain islands dont know where directly im just hired as the errand boy  sam the slavain islands  matt swavain swavain i was just supposed to come back here supposed to meet up with the  folks of the mist the ship that youve now commandeered youve killed
